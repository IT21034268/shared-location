4,Good Wood,Good color and nice size; my only complaint is that saw marks are clearly visible on the ends. What matters most is that my fish like it. It looks so much better than the artificial plastic molded wood I had before.
3,Misinformation,"This item arrived quickly and packaged well. Arrived a day earlier then the earliest date. This is a beautiful piece of driftwood and I am extremely pleased with its appearance. The only issue which is why its not 5 stars is the product info listed the large driftwood as 20-26"" long. The piece I paid for (large) only measured in at 16.5"". The item I r3eceived was a medium and not a large as I was expecting."
2,PLEASE - Some honest reviews of this DVD,I LOVE this band - but I just wanted to warn anyone else who was sucked in by these glowing reviews - the vision quality - AND the quality of the shooting itself - is EXTREMELY dissapointing - so bad I could not get passed the third song. I'm 43 and and bought a ton of DVD's - but this would be in my Top 10 of the most dissapointing. BE WARNED. Sorry to the band - still love ya.
4,Evocative,"A beautiful, touching book with lovely photographs. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that a more contemporary look would be worthwhile. Still, even though outdated, it is a marvelous look at the religious life of some years ago. Anyone actually moved to consider the monastic life by looking at this book would be well advised to get an update, however!"
3,Campy as hell,"but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This is typical Russell; weird non-fitting dreams, and definitely not enough violence, horror or sex when, here, it wouldn't be superfluous, but highly helpful in making the film even better. The acting is interesting, to say the least. Worth a watch or two, but try to get a cheap used copy."
5,Ken Russell's Lair,Much fun and a joy for those of us who appreciate this director's work. Russell's commentary on the DVD version is great. A. O'Donahue works wonders as the Snake Goddess. Well worth the price.
4,A competent collection,"This collection of poems centers on the theme of Fatherhood. The husband and wife team of David and Judy Ray collect the work of over one- hundred poets. Among these poets are very well- known ones like Raymond Carver, Robert Bly, Gwendolyn Brooks, Rita Dove, Philip Levine, Maxine Kumin, Carolyn Kizer, Linda Pastan, Donald Justice, Charles Simic. The majority of the poems are by poets lesser known. Most of the poems are written by the poets about their fathers, but there are also poems in which the subject if the poet as father. Perhaps this is not my best day, and I am unfair but I did not find here the kind of poem I am looking for, the one which make me 'see' and ' feel' deeply. Page after page, competent poem after competent poem without my finding what I truly sought, the kind of inspiration and insight found in Kafka's 'Letter to his Father'."
2,The stick is to small,"This product says that it is a Brine SUPER TOSS 2 pack w/ mini ball. They mention the ball being small, but forget to mention the lacrosse sticks being small. I don not see anywhere in the name that teh lacrosse sticks are mini."
5,another use besides the well-known one,"You can also use castor to put in your eyes, if they feel irritated. Sometimes just before going to bed I will massage it into my eyes if they have felt strained from computer use.I've been doing this for years so it is perfectly safe.And an odd aside: When I am in the bathroom opening the bottle, one of my cats is right there and wants a couple of licks off my finger. Cats are very intuitive so I wonder what he knows.Silvia"
5,A Story Tellers Delight!,"This book and the other three books by Richard Lansing offer parents, teachers and other readers a wonderful opportunity to read to children. The involvment of the listeners and the delightful conclusions to each of the stories are unique and surprising. Mr. Lansing's books are a must for every elementary school library."
4,t plays it cool,"dope soudtrack too bad it's slept on marvin gaye put it down hard t plays it cool was very funky hard hitting drums, synthesizers, horns, man it qwas sampled by jazzy jeff in 87 my next favorite track is t stands for trouble which has been sampled also but still the tityle track is funky and marvin at his best he was trouble man 4reel and we all know how he ended up."
5,Great Classic Soundtrack with added bonuses,"this is a great expansion of an already classic album that is not really known as one of Marvin Gaye's best albums,"
4,""" ..three things that's for sure: taxes, death and trouble""","This line, of course, comes from the title track from this underated soundtrack album by Marvin Gaye. One of the most autobiographical songs he recorded, it also feature great sax work by Trevor Lawrence. The rest of the album is good too, featuring some great instrumentals (""T"" Plays it Cool,"" the main theme). Definitely worth picking up."
2,BIg change,"Been buying this product and was so happy to find a fairly healthy salad dressing that was actually very good! In fact I eventold our leader at WW about it. Recently, I went to get more and they had none and said that it was a special order and could not get it any more and I couldn't find it any place so I ordered it on Amazon. When it arrived I was showing someone the label ingredients and was amazed at the changes on the label.......very disappointed that I now had 6 bottles of a salad dressing I could not use since I am already on a low salt diet. Had called the company and they said they had changed the recipe and no longer had that particular one......too bad! It was very low fat, sodium and no sugar yet had an excellent taste. VERY DISAPPOINTED!Drews All Natural Roasted Garlic & Peppercorn Dressing 12 oz. (Pack of 12)"
3,Not a fan,"Although the wow books are nicely put together, i find a lot of the material very web and special effects orientated, theres a lot of how to make dodgy web buttons and create various mediocre effects."
1,"If you want baby, easy!","The world is over-populated. Please be open and learn from the Europeans: adopt desserted babies in South America, Asia, Africa and now one more source (caused by the American government): Iraq. Empty middle-age? So much to busy with! Be a loving person."
4,Interesting..but not the whole story,"I think Lotte Bailyn's recent book, Beyond Work-Family Balance, does a lot to address the issues that Hewlett raises about the choices women are faced with. Why do women need to choose work or family? (There is a great editorial in June 2002 Harvard Business Review on this!) Organizations need to address the fact that women and men have personal lives that affect their workplace performance!"
2,"Good product, s-l-o-w shipping!!!",Daughter loves the CD but Amazon took one month to deliver. That's unsatisfactory and I would have purchased elsewhere had I known.
4,Great Fun!!!!,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it. It has all the popular music that is on the radio. Yes, the voices aren't great but the rhythm and the beat are really fun. I made a mistake and bought the Gwen Stefani CD for her not realizing that what you hear on the radio is not what you get on the CD. I had to convince her that the song said SHIP instead of SH**. Thats another story...I don't what I was thinking. With this CD you don't have to worry about the language and its a lot of fun."
1,This makes baby Jesus cry,"I don't know what's worse; the fact that soccer moms with the mental capacity of a spoon are perpetuating this satanic musical force, or the fact that it's in the top 20 on this website."
1,HA!,"Kidz Bop has always given me a good, hearty laugh. These lame kids thinking they sound cool when they sing popular songs. I nearly keeled over with mirth at their rendition of 'Pump it'. Anyway, yeah. They really suck. But it is funny listening to them try..."
4,Great shoes,"My son (17 years old) is very tough on shoes and he wore these for 4 months, his typical length of time that he wears Adidas. They look pretty good (I would've given them a 5 if they had been less 70's style in color), he liked them, and they wore well - we couldn't as for more than that."
2,Ugh,I love these colors but the sneaker is not feminine at all. It is definitely a skater's shoe. It is very think and just very masculine.
1,Had to return this shoes...,They look cool online... but they are aweful in real life >>> disclaimer : i'm a bit picky... but still!!!
1,sent me the wrong ITEMS...,"don't hold out much hope you'll get what you ordered. I only received one of the items I ordered, the rest were bandanas I didn't want! They just sent all the wrong thing. Maybe they think people won't notice the difference."
5,This book is a MUST READ,"This is not only a must read, but a must share it with everyone you know. Everyone knows how corrupt the government is but this will open your eyes to read others to see how much which is more than you can imagine. America needs to wake up and smell the coffee. If you want to keep your family and finances safe, I urge you to read this and ""A Case Against the Fed"" and ""Creature from Jekyll Island, A Second Look at the Fed"". You owe it to yourself, your family and your friends."
5,Best presentation on the gold standard money can buy,"This is book is beautiful in its simplicity. Rothbard first presents accurately what has historically happened when money is left up to the government. The important thing to remember is that Rothbard just doesn't make stuff up, he uses history to portray why the gold standard (and really, a privatized system of currency) is necessary for maximum freedom.Even if you're not a Libertarian or an economist, you will appreciate Rothbard's perspective on the money you use everyday. Agree or disagree, this book is great."
1,Sad delusions of goldbugs,"This book is your usual right wing rant against governments as a whole and Keynesian fiscal policy in particular.Only the extreme right want a return to the gold standard, the vast majority of mainstream economists from both the left and right reject a gold standard as inflexible and out-dated.Try again please."
4,Celiac Friendly Noodle,"These make a great alternative to rice when making stir fries. They are allergy friendly as they contain no corn or wheat. They are pretty easy to overcook but if that happens, I just throw them in a hot skillet with sesame oil and fry them up a little which gives them a great flavor and texture. Wider noodles or the large flakes are easier to cook properly it seems. They go ok with tomato based sauces as well. Over all, a pretty good product."
2,Sub-par work from a normally good band,"This album is, in my opinion, by far the weakest album by MBM. Dull, pedestrian electronic noodling that really doesn't go anywhere; the best thing I can say about this album is that at least it's not outright awful and it wasn't a blatant attempt to sell out and go commercial. Nevertheless, don't waste your time and money on this album; there's far better stuff by Meat Beat Manifesto.Depending on what particular era/style of techno or industrial you like, go for either their early albums, 99%, or SUBLIMINAL SANDWICH, all of which are far superior to SATYRICON."
4,Fits great,"perfect it fit wonderfully and I'm glad I found them, thanks for making my hand vac work great again happy"
5,Coaching tools you can really use.,"If you want to be a coach, or incorporate coaching skills into your business life as a manager, this is a great introduction to coaching.Or if you just want to communicate more effecively, this is a great tape."
2,Not much to get excited about,"I purchased this book for myself because it was on sale on Amazon. The book has a couple interesting patterns in it but as I flipped through the pages, nothing really caught my eye or seemed like something I really wanted to make. I was disappointed by how few patterns there were in the book, particularly when one pattern is counted as 8 or 10 separate patterns (several different styles of finger puppets, none of which will I ever make). Overall I was pretty disappointed. This wouldn't be a bad book to rent from the library, but not worth spending money on."
2,weekend knitting,"i found the flower washcloth pattern a little vague.and the finger puppet,difficult."
1,Pretty pictures but poor instructions,"I am an experienced knitter and was very excited about getting this book as a gift. The pictures are beautiful and there were several projects that looked challenging enough for me to learn a few new things. I started by making the gloves. After getting confused by the instructions and having to rip out the first glove several times I consulted other patterns and found several errors in this book. In order to finish these I had to completely revise the pattern and ignore the book. Even after this I felt that one bad pattern wasn't worth dismissing the entire book, so I tried the brioche scarf. Once again the pattern was confusing and I had to chart my own waters to complete the scarf. Unless you are using the book merely as inspiration to develop your own projects I would not recommend it."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The Amazons are non too pleased with that old mission to man's world thing, and how Princess Diana has been performing in the role.Recalling her, they decide she has to prove herself in a good old fashioned super powered Decathlon/Pentathlon/Bitch Fight all rolled into one."
2,Spa Booster Seat,"This seat is not as advertised. The cushion is difficult to fill because it does not have a valve in the stem. Therefore when you fill it with water, it shoots back out on you while you work to plug it. Secondly, it does not stay put. It wants to lift you off the seat. I returned mine and was not refunded the original shipping cost of approx. $6.00. So I'm out $12. Yuck."
1,cushion,"This is not what I wanted. I wanted to use it in my walk in bath. It will not fit, and I uave no use for it"
2,"Complicated, convoluted, drab.","I love this holiday and I think this book doesn't do it justice. My kids like the story well enough, but can't someone write a story more interesting and evocative than this one? The illustrations are nothing special, also. It seems like a holiday that is all about harvest and bounty and nature should have rich, vibrant illustrations, not washed out ones. There's a lot of development of the two siblings sleeping out in the sukkah together and getting frightened, but it doesn't seem believable to me."
1,The Dark Side Interviews,"This is the worst pink floyd DVD in fact the worst DVD that money can buy. Its a collection of old TV interviews badly recorded and cobbled together, there is no link between the interviews or subject matter it just changes mid sentence to another subject making you think the disk has jumped its so bad my 12 year old has done better with youTube uploads. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you have have money to burn. Rgds"
1,Horrid Transfer!,"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror AKA The Torture Chamber of Doctor Sadism, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound. This is in reference to the ""Thrill Kill"" DVD release. The Movie gets 3 to 4 stars from me personally."
4,I am a gardener so I was interested in her thoughts.,"I found it to be a bit slow at times and I did skip over several pages, but overall, an enjoyable read. I am an east coast gardener, so it was interesting for me to read about her trials of the west coast."
4,Hmm . . .,"I bought this CD because I loved the song ""Invisible Man"" and their second album, 98 Degrees and Rising. To be perfectly honest, I didn't like it all that much. There were a few good songs, but nothing that really stood out, other than ""Invisible Man"". It's not a bad CD, but I guess I just expected more from it after listening to their second album for so long."
4,BEST CD I'VE BOUGHT THIS YEAR,"I like ALL songs on this album, very very nice harmonies. My personal favourite is ""Take My Breath Away"", it's simply sweet! There are some slushy ones like ""The Invisible Man"" & ""Was it something I didn't Say"", both were released as singles and became big hits already. I strongly recommend ""The Invisible Man"" cos it's a song which everyone can relate themselves to. Just listen to the lyric, it made me cry everytime i hear it. Get this CD, you won't regret it."
2,Positives and Negatives,"Positives:* Deals with a very tough issue in a very real way* Explores guilt, the way a child takes over adult roles too early in life, grief, and a multitude of very real emotions that we don't usually talk about* Simple words make her easy to understandNegatives:* I don't like the descriptions that the author uses.* No resolution with anything, I don't even think they accurately portray the healing process of any of the major issues discussed in the book* I feel tempted to try the things that she does, rather than stay away from. That scares me because I know that a teenager reading it will have less self control than I do. (No offense to my students who are all wonderful)* There are very few positive moments, answers given to the problems, etc. The psychologist that plays a positive role could have provided some facts so that teenagers receive an accurate interpretation and don't lead themselves to other conclusions."
5,PERFECT is perfect.,"Pefect is a great novel for mothers and preteen/teen daughters to read together. The flawed relationship between Isabelle and her mother is a important element of the book. Also the realization that eating disorders are becoming problems for younger and younger girls day by day is a important message. Being Natasha Friend's first novel, it's very fantastic. It really talks about many problems, and inscecurities that people suffer from. PERFECT is the perfect book to buy and start reading. Once you read it you won't want to put it down, i know i sure didn't."
4,An in-depth look at the man behind the mogul,"George Lucas: The Creative Impulse is a great book which gives the reader a view over George Lucas and his life and filmography. The book introduces in sections Lucas' ""early years"", his films and also briefly his companies (ILM, Skywalker Sound, LucasArts) and also takes to a tour around Skywalker Ranch.Although there isn't as much behind-the-scenes info I would have hoped for, the book was really interesting with lots of big photographs taken during the production of Lucas' films and other neat stuff.Great book."
5,Best Dudley Moore Ever,"Dudley Moore at his finest. I've seen 'Arthur' touted as a ""screwball"" fest that seems to hail from the past, yet I disagree. Arthur seemed to me both original and sentimental. Moore's drunken, child-like, character confronts mortality within the only father figure apparent, John Gielgud's ""Hobson"", Arhtur's butler/nanny. Touching and effective, we find that through Arthur's eyes, we too can remain adults yet feel as children through the guidances of those we love. All involved turn in superb performances. Gielgud's performance is not only incredible but touching as the ""father-apparent"". Do yourself a favor and buy this movie."
2,Absolutely loved the movie but this DVD is depressing.,"There is a certain nostalgia to having a dvd where the movie looks and sounds exactly like it did when I saw it on cable back in 1983, but one would expect with the advances in digital technology that we could do a little better these days.This was a fantastic movie, it was entertaining, it has top notch box office numbers, AND it was nominated for awards back when movies people actually watched received awards.It is depressing that the best we can do is this off the cuff DVD, with poor panning and scanning, poor picture quality, and terrible sound.If ever a movie deserved a special edition DVD it's this one, how is it that the sub-standard sequel, which was immediately forgotten by everyone, gets a widescreen digitally mastered edition before this absolute classic does?Never before have I seen a GREAT movie tarnished by it's DVD release."
2,Sick Humor,"Arthur was considered a very successful romantic comedy after it was released in 1981. The strong cast had much to do with the film's early success. However, times have changed during the past twenty-two years and the movie's humor about an alcoholic and his antics has begun to look just plain sick."
1,Desperately in need of a WIDESCREEN reissue!!!,Timeless classic film trapped in a 20th century edit. Ugh. Unforgivable. Are we on hold for a 30th anniversary edition? The wait goes on.
1,Love the movie - hate the DVD,"There's something terribly wrong with the volume. You have to turn it up so loud to hear it that the sound is distorted. Probably should have returned it, but that's such a pain."
3,Interesting Movie.,"This film from 1981 is interesting, and features good performances from Dudley Moore, Liza Minelli and Sir John Gielgud. It holds your attention throughout, but it's only worth one viewing. I don't know if the remake is worth seeing, though. I'd probably avoid it, if I were you, though. This version has a great theme song, though.Wish they'd cut out the line that Hobson says after Arthur ambles off to take a bath. It was just too crass and disgusting, at least for my taste."
1,Amateurishly typeset,"The BiblioBazaar edition of ""A Concise Dictionary of Middle English"" appears to be a poorly typeset copy of the electronic text available from Project Gutenberg (Ebook #10625). BiblioBazaar improved on the Plain Label Books edition by replacing underlined words with italic text, but that seems to be the limit of their effort. For example, instead of using boldface, words are surrounded by tildes (~bold~) and yoghs are represented as ""3*"", just as in the Gutenberg text."
3,Item as described.,"The Item is as described. There are no issues with the item, but it would be preferable to find a higher thread count item."
2,Not as pictured,"It is a nice acylic box but I was greatly disappointed. I intended to use it for my daughters wedding for cards, and therefore wanted a clear box, as pictured. What I got was black acylic.. no time to exchange."
5,That warm and fuzzy feeling,"I love everything about this album and can't recommend it enough. My mom listened to it when she was a kid, and she continued the holiday tradition when my brother and I were growing up. The tone of the choir is faultless, and each soloist brings a rich and unique style to the mix. Plus, the selections range from classics that are well-known in the States to little-known carols from Spain and Britain, which are lovely. I listen to this year round, as background music for working/reading or just to take it in. The sound quality of these tracks is also remarkable for their age.This collection will not disappoint any choral enthusiast."
5,"A superbly produced DVD, highly recommended","Lionsgate is a premier producer of both adult and children's DVD entertainment for the home. This DVD specifically for preschool children is especially recommended as wholesome entertainment. In ""Book Fair"" (book/DVD combination) everyone's favorite purple dinosaur takes children on a storybook adventure demonstrating how reading can help their imaginations engage in such diverse activities as building a make-believe rocket, putting on a circus, or creating books of their own! A superbly produced DVD, highly recommended, that will provide viewing fun and playtime entertainment over and over again."
2,bad quality and nort as expected,"when I received this Bible had a smoke smell on the pages. This is not what I as expecting, I though it would have some other features and I was wrong.If you want quality please do not buy this Bible"
2,"Don't Waste Your Time, Buy The Real Stuff","By way of introduction, I am Brazilian and grew up, not only listening to, but loving Gilberto Gil. When I saw this album among his new releases, I got curious. I read your customer reviews, and since they contradict each other, I figured I would give it a listen myself. I was hoping the album would be a Gilberto Gil interpretation of Marley's music, and in some few and far between instances there is some of that; but I have to agree with the review that states that this album is a ""too faithful interpretation of Bob Marley"". It is Gilberto doing Marley without any Gilberto flairs. It's not a fusion of Brazilian music with Raggae, just an artist singing the old tunes with the old band (which still has what it takes, I must add). Save your money and buy the old Marley records."
2,"Acrid ""new car smell"" requires ample ventilation","I'm hoping this smell goes away, because after a full day of charging, the hot end of the unit is still emitting a VERY acrid stench that is not tolerable and requires lots of room ventilation."
2,A Little Disappointed,My Fault! I should have done my homework a little better. The Battery Charger works good but is much too slow. I bought it because I had the idea of using it for D cells. But it would take 16 hours to charge D cells. Even the smaller AA or AAA takes 8 hours. Does the job but much too slow.
5,What Is Really Important?,"I suppose Clare Weakley would sell more books if he wrote on A Guide For Reality TV Shows but he selected the most important thing in this life -- a personal relationship with the loving Father God who knows our every thought and wants to see us have a living personal experience with Him. It proved to be a stepping stone for me out of religion and into the arms of God. I recommend it on my website for fellow ""recovering legalists"" -- www.recoveringlegalists.org"
4,I'm not a woman,"This album only has 2 songs that i may say they are good, i'm not a big fan of Shania, not even a regular fan but I respect her because she has a few very good songs but not in this album, that's my opinion, as for the dvd-audio point of view, the clarity of the songs is naturally amazing, really really crisp and sharp, you can hear every single detail in the recording but you won't feel any surround effects, it's ok if you like Shania Twain but not if you are looking for a true surround music experience."
1,Unbelievable,"I bought this book in the U.S. when preparing to come to Slovenia. Little did I know ... it is replete with misspellings, the conversational style in the book is totally unrealistic, verging on the bizarre -- friends in Ljubljana giggled when they heard the tapes, one asked if they were actually supposed to be native speakers -- and the book leaves out essential grammatical concepts like the ""dual"" number ... I was tempted to return it to the publisher, but I've kept it around to show to Slovenes as a coffee-table novelty. It never fails to amuse. Anyone who ""learns"" Slovene from this book will be absolutely helpless on a typical day in Ljubljana."
2,Disappointing - badly edited.,"I can make do with this book, but I'm disappointed that there isn't much else available (at least on Amazon.com) There are many misspellings in the text, a real no-no with language teaching, and the pronunciation guide in the front doesn't tell English speakers that the ""c"" in Slovenian is pronounced ""ts""! It's also badly organized, with a lot of different things crammed into each chapter; also, the cassettes, while very helpful with native speakers, don't coordinate well with the text."
4,okay for price,lower cotton t-shirts then in the past. kinda of stiff. but these were the cheapest t-shirts I've ever bought so sorta expected that.
1,Do not buy these shirts,"I just received my order and the shots are all stamped ""irregular"" in black ink! I was a little annoyed because the website says nothing about them being anything less than standard quality new shirts. I opened the bag and some of the shirts actually had stains! Disgusting! I'm really surprised with Amazon."
4,"Good, but could be better","I think this is a good by for anyone who owns an Archos. Some of the features you get from it you should be able to get without it. For instance, you shouldn't have to buy a peripheral like this in order to charge the main device from the wall (without one of the peripherals charging is only possible by usb). Also, I am not quite sure why they even allow you to output video with a component cable if there is no option to switch between 480i and 480p on the device. And there is no component input. Overall it is good, but some of the features seem forced, like you have to buy it in order to get stuff that should come standard and some features don't seem implemented well."
2,No built in tuner should be a deal breaker,"No built in tuner means that when you want to record a show, the cable box will be turned to the recording channel. So if someone is watching tv when a scheduled recording is beginning, the channel will be changed and they will have to watch the show that is being recorded to the Archos. Unless of course you rent a separate cable box just for the Archos to use. Instead, Archos should have charged $10 more and put a built in tuner in the device. Instead, buy a usb or pci capture card, download free pvr software and have your PC or Mac do the recording and transfer the video to your Archos like you will with most of your video or music.Any device like this or the low end sling boxes that don't have the traditional coaxial cable hookups (usually is a single cable that screws in - traditional cable company wiring) means the device will not have a built in tuner."
5,Archos DVR Unit,WOW! This is one product that I don't think I'll ever use all of the features. Too many to mention. Great for transfering videos from your TIVO or DISH to the unit for portable viewing. A great product and well worth the purchase!
1,Stay away from all things Archos!!,First of all if you want to play any files from Ipods or mpeg files you have to drop another 40bucks on plugins. If that is not enough on the dvr station wont work unless you have wi fi at your house (which I dont). Also slow start up and the website gave me wrong advice on how to calibrate. So long story short$80 for dvr$40 for plug ins$270 for Archosyou have a slow pos version of an touch Ipod!DO Not buy!!
3,barely made the cut,"I was anxious to purchase it just from the title and the picture on the case, but it didn't even reach the 50% thunbs up rating with me...."
1,Just.... LOL!,"It's a First act! Lol, c'mon, really? who would buy a first act for that much? These are Wal-mart guitars... If you want a REAL guitar for $3,000 go get a Gibson, not a first act. Who does first act think they are? lol"
3,A little sub-par for T. Jefferson Parker,"As a huge fan of T. Jefferson Parker, I awaited this book with great anticipation. His previous novels were all awesome and deserve 5 stars, however, this book fell short for me.Starting out with a lot of promise, it seemed to lose steam for me at about the midway point, and I was somewhat disapointed on how it was wrapped up. I felt it was rushed towards the end, and the resolution of some of the characters personal feelings and dilema's were closed too quickly."
5,Excellent show to watch with your teenagers,"I wish season 2 were available. This was a wonderful, actionpacked interesting show that teaches core good values to everyone."
2,do not recommend,"Mine arrived slightly concave, so it didn't sit flat on the counter. I had to return it."
3,The board warped in the first week,"We bought this board because of the Cook's Illustrated review. Using Cook's recommendations, we seasoned it with mineral oil on both sides. That didn't stop the cutting board from warping within the first week. I'm not certain whether the failure is the Cook's Illustrated recommendations, the board, or my application. But, whatever the failure, it didn't work for me."
1,"Nice, but not built to last","I bought one of these a year ago and it worked well for a while. I oiled it with mineral oil every month and always washed it by hand. After a few months it became warped, but a few months later it straightened itself out again. Now it has split down the middle. It looked nice and worked well for a year, but I wouldn't buy again."
2,Be warned,Hopefully this is going to give you some really helpful tips about this series.When this series first aired they showed the second to the last episode first. A lot of people complained about this and apparently after reading another review they followed the same pattern with the DVD release.The fansub group that was doing this series originaly added pictures of the characters in this series and it sparked a huge debate. The banner was changed eventualy. The viewers complained about the series being on about the same level as Hentai.On a frequent basis the main characters close will suddenly explode leaving her completely bare. I won't give you any details as to why if you do decide to watch this series.This series in the end landed in my pile of never to watch again.I will admit though the ending song is probably one of the best songs I have heard on any anime series. It's one that I want for my primary music collection.
4,good deal,"I purchased this as a Father's day gift for my husband. I thought I was getting a good deal for the money. The movies are not really what I typically enjoy, but my husband has really loved watching them."
2,Not received as pictured!,"I had a Thexton 436 already from several years ago. I bought another one to use at home. I received a totally redesigned one that has a very cheesy black handle, not the nice red plastic solid handle that is pictured on Amazon. They probably are all that way now, less for more."
2,Different very different.,"Welp, I was expecting raw energy and amazing musicmanship like on ""Birds."" Killer riffs and passion of lyrics but then I played ""Night"" and said what the F is this. So I tell myself its tough to top an album like Birds. I dont know what direction there goin but it aint forward. Not so good, real dancey fake drum."
4,so far so good,"My cubic wall was 3"" thick. This one worked just fine for me and it need no drill. I bought several ones for me and my colleagues."
1,Contortionism,"For a moment I feared I was going to end up vomiting when watching this DVD... I thought it was suposed to be Yoga, instead you get this very vain guy contorting his body in the most complicated and unnecessary ways... AVOID"
2,FA drinking water test kit.,"It came with everything advertized and arrived promptly.Very easy to use except the bacteria test. That took 48 hours.My water tested bad for bacteria. So I need to retest after using some clorox.Had to wait for a week or two to get the water to clear back up to what it was before.Overall though, it was a great product. I will order another.I ordered another and it came as some have said missing tests and the box was partially crushed. Not worth the effort to try and return."
1,Does not contain chloramine test,Does not detect chloramines - one of the mainly used desinfectants in the US. Found out after I did all the tests & wondered why the chlorine test came back undetected. Need to buy different kit! Other tests were fine but again ... a kit should contain at least the main tests!
1,Missing parts,Missing the 2 out of the five testing parts. Openned package and 2 test kits out of the five were missing.
5,great book for children to teach meaning of Christmas,At last I found a book for younger ones that they can touch and feel the animals as you read the story of Baby Jesus on the night he was born. It is simple enough but not to simple to keep them interested.
5,"Excellent, Intimate yet Touching","I loved this movie, and I certainly didn't grow up in the 50's. Rather, I grew up in the late 80's-early 90's! I thought that the chemistry between the two main characters was great, and I loved how they were so... well... proper! (Unlike today's movies, where they would have had a baby by the end). It was funny and touching, and I ultimately I felt like I was there. I definently recommend it!"
2,nature path makes organic corn,"nature path is than Baby loves ! We love it as a sub for morning cereal. It is simple as can be!No sugar added! organicI still have to research about the puff process...but so far we love the product and also their rice, kamut and millet puffs! I put millet puffs on anything and baby will it it :))"
2,a little tough,"not a good excuse for a morning cereal...perhaps good for your chickens. squirels, etc.."
3,Unusual Clarity,"""Arrogance"" would be just another nail in the liberal press coffin except for one sterling chapter. In the middle of the book, Bernard Goldberg interviews Bob Costas about media sports coverage, bias, and political correctness. Costas is a self- acknowledged liberal on most political matters, but when he discusses how the national media handles blacks and females in sports, he plows new ground and sounds like a conservative. His explanations about the misbehavior of black professional athletes (and how the press refuses to mention it) is worth the price of the book. Costas explains himself with such great examples and such clarity that I have read that chapter at least four times already. It is a chapter that should be reprinted in every sports magazine."
1,A Major Disappointment,Much of the information here has already been covered in his previous book Bias. Given Mr. Goldberg's tone in the book the title probably refers to his own viewpoints. He has a harsh tone and a I-know-everything point of view. The most liberal of all media owners publishes his book at the same time Goldberg is crtical of liberal media. Hahahah What a joke! It seems to me that the author has sold out to the highest bidder and this casts a dark shawdow on his real motives.
1,sloppy again,"Once again, Goldberg has written a book that when you apply the scientific method of gathering facts and evidence is shown to be riddled with lies.How many books are the Right going to write that aren't right?Remember: The right wing lies. The wing right wants to take your money so they can buy drugs like Rush. Ignore them!"
1,I simply didn't see much here that an average...,"...parent wouldn't already know from the popular press...anyone that reads newspapers or watches TV knows that obesity is a problem, exercise has multiple benefits, walking is good for you, etc...she provides a few interesting activities but none of them offer any advantage over a simple visit to playground...and for some reason she presents a borderline ludicrous attack on infant swim and exercise programs...the American Academy of Pediatrics says ONLY that exercise programs shouldn't be promoted as being more beneficial than simple supervised play and swimming programs shouldn't be see as a way of preventing drowning...moreover, she leaves out pertinent advice for outdoor activities such as the risks of dehydration, heat exposure, and sunlight, etc...save your money and use what you probably already know and refer to the AAP website for relevant FREE safety advice."
1,No jokes you couldn't see coming,"It's always weird to review a movie like this which claims to be a spoof but doesn't really creatively spoof the actual genre it mocks. This has become a big problem with the recent spate of movies in this genre and only seems to be getting worse. One thing these movies keep doing is just doing an imitation of a scene from a famous movie in the genre they're making fun of. That problem continues here and to be honest that's not good writing. It's just lazy. If these folks aren't going to spend the time writing some insightfully funny about this why even bother?Just re-watch the movies this is making fun of, you'll have a better time. And if you want to read an interesting new take on the superhero genre, check out BABY MONSTERS at [...]"
3,"Hilarious, except for one thing...","What David Zucker has managed to do in movies such as naked gun, airplane, scary movie etc. is make a funny spoof without going over the edge and making it offensive. But superhero movie failed to do so this time.I love all of Zucker's movies, and i enjoyed this one, except for the part where they made fun of Stephen Hawking. It's the one person i don't like to see being made fun of. That is why i gave it 3 stars as opposed to 5. Other than that, the film was funny and enjoyable, but one thing they could have done to make it better was if they had not followed the spider man plot so closely. They should have changed it a bit, and maybe it would have been more funny. It also has a good cast as opposed to some of the previous spoof movies.If you are up-to-date with pop culture and enjoy spoof movies, this one should be good to add to your collection."
5,Best Spoof since the Scary Movie Series.,"Wow. This maintained being funny and then being serious. I havn't seen any other spoof (I've seen every one since Scary Movie) that has done that. And when it is funny, it is VeRY funny.This is the BEST spoof since the Scary Movie series. So much better than Date,Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans. 4.5 Great Job little Snail!"
3,Over the top satire,"If you really take your superheroes seriously, try Iron Man or one of those.But, if you're up for broad satire, slapstick, and a fair bit of potty and peepee humor, you came to the right place. A few (well, more than a few) vaguely adult moments argue against bringing your eight year old boy, who might otherwise be the ideal audience. But, if you have someone who thinks like an eight year old boy, you're probably in luck. And there are distressingly many of us out there.As always, a few moments teetered almost beyond mere tastelessness. The Stephen Hawking character, for example, could have been done badly. Instead, that remarkable icon of our era received the same cheerful irreverence as anyone else. Hey, people have laughed at worse. And laughter is the one thing I'm sure you'll get from this movie, whether you'll want to admit to it later or not.-- wiredweird"
2,"you'll laugh, or maybe groan","Remember, like, in elementary school when someone farted? And it was really funny? Do you also think it's hilarious when someone gets hurt, like getting bonked on the head? Over and over? Well, then, you'll appreciate this movie. Otherwise, you might be out of luck. ""Superhero Movie"" is much better than the earlier ""movie"" parodies by the same people, but unfortunately, not that much better. Drake Bell is appealing as the Peter Parker-type teen who gets bit by a dragonfly and develops superpowers. Other cast members, including Leslie Nielson and Sara Paxton as the love interest (mugging like Kirsten Dunst) do a good job, too, but they can't make such a lame script funny. Unless of course, you find flatulence really funny. There's lots of farting in this movie. And a few small clever bits, but they are few and far between. These movies are like the Y2K equivalent of Tom Green movies, you can't figure out why they keep getting made. Oh well, maybe they appeal to somebody."
1,Poor quality battery,"I ordered two of these. One did not work from the start, and the other lasted through only about six charges. Waste of money."
3,good except...,"The case fits my 12"" ibook perfectly and I love that when it's all zipped up it looks more like a binder than a laptop. However, the zipper pulls broke off within a week of owning it and the fabric binding at the top of the inner mesh pocket dyed a black stripe across my white computer."
3,Psychedelic Freakout,"This is a reissue of two Ventures albums from 1967. As on most Ventures albums, they feature about half original compostions and half covers of recent hits. At this point in their career, the Ventures were employing a ""harder"" sound than they previously had, but you still wouldn't mistake them for a ""heavy"" rock band. Some of the covers work better than others. ""Good Thing"" and ""Theme From The Wild Angels"" are great, but ""Snoopy vs. The Red Baron"" and ""Western Union"" don't really work as instrumentals. As for the originals, they also vary in quality. Many of them are somewhat experimental, and some of the experiments work better than others. One experiment that works quite well is ""Psyched-Out"". This fuzz guitar workout is one of the best things the Ventures ever recorded. It was later retitled ""Flights of Fantasy"" and issued as a single in a remixed version. Ventures fans may want to pick up this CD."
1,Worthless,Don't waste your money. A pedal broke off within the first five minutes of use. Also there is no company information so you can't get any replacement parts.
1,Flimsy,"While it is effective for arms, trying to pedal with the legs is impractical. This exerciser is too light to be used without it being braced by a table, chair, etc, to keep it from slipping when pedaling. Also, after about a week of use, one of the pedals stripped off."
1,beware...,"This is not your traditional Thomas DVD... It's done on the computer, and my son hates it! The trains mouths move very weird and fast... the people are creepy, just all around weird..."
4,Very Good Purchase,"This was exactly what I wanted and needed, even more room than expected. I am thinking of ordering another set for my holiday china."
3,External USB Hard Drive,I have no feedback because it was a Christmas Gift. So far I have heard no complants. Shipment was promp and item was in good condition.
2,So so,I thought that the book had an interesting idea. I would have liked to see a touch of humor to break up the bitterness of the story. Also I didn't like that the mother put the bunny to sleep.
3,Terribly sad and thought-provoking,"I really don't see what all the fuss is about this book. Although it's a fairly good story, the character of Mrs. Hunsdorfer doesn't stand up without more background information, and Roth's psychosis is completely implausible on the information given. However, it is thought-provoking, mainly in that you try to figure out why on Earth Beatrice is as she is. It's a fairly good quick read."
5,my favorite comedian,"The man is bloody hilarious, he has to be my favorite comedian. He's more structured and less crude than Robin Williams (I would dare say less crass than Dane Cook) but is great at making his life and experiences funny as hell. Listen for the ""Pedophile Crucifixion"", 1 of my favorite routines. Absolutely hilarious comedian, you will love him."
4,Good read,"This was my first introduction to Julie Smith's detective, Skip Langdon. I must admit to being a bit prejudiced in favor of stories set in New Orleans... even so, the characters and the plot stand up well, and I would read Smith again."
2,Skip SKIP,It is possible Julie Smith is a good writer. Her first two Skip Landon mysteries would indicate that. But somewhere along the line it all fell apart and I couldn't finish this clunker. It is a shame because Smith was able to catch the atmosphere of New Orleans and the quirky aspects of Skip but then got bogged down.
4,Spaldeen 101,"It's hard to fault a book that includes a spaldeen with it. Yes, a spaldeen--that's the canonically correct term for the pink rubber ball that is supplied with and described by this book. Obviously, the publisher wanted to avoid the sticky situation of the ball's true name, a corruption of the manufacturer's name, Spalding. No self-respecting New York kid would ever call it a pinky ball.Despite the book's heavy dose of political correctness and Y2K-esque paranoia (basically, it advises kids not to do anything dangerous, which seems to extend to bouncing the ball near a street), this is a great little tome. There's lots of games described for kids to learn, and even a brief history of the ball--the spaldeen is correctly presented as the ultimate evolution of ball technology, which started with ancient Egyptians kid playing with mud they'd roll up into balls."
3,Not as advertised,This is a cool reader in that it's so small but it is NO compatible with Mac OS 10+ despite it's advertisement as such. I contacted them and they said this model was six years old. Even my PC has some problems but I finally got it working. I'd recommend their newer model or another.
4,CAPTURED,"No one has ever captured my curiosity and blessed the effort to satisfy it as Paul did in THE ORPHAN. I went on a great journey with the character in this book, and explored the emotional havock that presented itself with depth and understanding. This book offers new insight regarding the words ""normal"" and ""successful"". Paul captured the beauty of Creation and the pain of innocence with expertise."
3,Good product,"This is a good product and had ordered with other items that were free shipping so (my fault) missed the fact of how much the shipping for this item would cost. Paid more for shipping than the product which made it not such a good deal. Product is fine, though."
3,How to eat fried worms,"I thought that in some parts it was disgusting. I think the author has a good imagination. Also some of the bits were very funny. We recommend this book for 4,5,6 grade."
3,How to eat frid worms,How to eat frid worms is a very good book. If you are looking for a book with imaganation.Itis about a boy that made a bet to eat 15 frid worms for fifty dollars.
4,I loved this book,"I loved this book when I read it when I was much younger. You see Billy the underdog take on a bet that was unbelievable. Eating worms is bad, eating 15 of them is worse yet, but it was for 50 dollars. You watch as Billy struggles to complete is bet. People try to stop him, but when you want something badly enough you always win. This book is also just plain fun. This one is great to read out loud or read to yourself."
3,James' review on How to Eat Fried Worms,I sort of like the book because it has worms in it. It sounds yuck that Billy has to eat his worms with horseradish. Some of the worms came from the cow manure!
3,Fantastic,I think this book is unusual because Billy has to eat 15 wormsto win $50. Billy is determined to get that $50 so he can buya mini bike.
3,how to eat fried worms,"This is a very interesing exciting sort of book that makes your tummy turn!Thomas Rockwell has put all his thought into writing this book and all his time has paid off.All the kids around the world would definately be absorbed in this book and they should all read it,its great!"
4,lol,"This is one of these great old-school kids' books with a zany premise. Sure, fried worms are gross, but this story is a lot of fun, and way better than many of the ""kids' books"" written and published today."
4,Good Travel System!,"I'm a first time travel system user after 3 kids...It is very convenient! I had to get used to folding it and now after almost 2 mos, I have the hang of it - one handed! The design is cute too!"
4,"Good shirt, XL. Feels like XXL",I usually wear XL shirts but this one feels like a XXL...otherwise OK. I will give it to a friend who will fit it better.
5,Great for hot weather!,Columbia did it again with these shirts! They allow you to stay comfortable while protecting you from the sun. They run big so order at least a size smaller than you normally wear. You will enjoy these............
1,I don`t know what to do.,I have been caught before with re-recordings of originals - usually by the Tring label. I had all the original vinyl recordings and now I don`t know whether or not to get the CDs - perhaps we could get some verification as to whether they are the original recordings or not.
4,Ebay start up,"A very simple book to follow. The items arrived when expected in perfect condition. I will be making more purchases since it appears that I have no fear of my purchases not arriving or getting them in a less than perfect condition. As far as the info in the book, it was what i needed. It gave clear direction with easy to follow instruction. It gave no false claims of instant wealth but realistic expectations of possible progress."
5,Handy for all types of candles,The lighter adjusts as described. Very useful way to reach those hard to light candles. I'm very pleased with the quality of the product and the response time of the suppliers.
2,Bulky Waste,"Time to think 'green' and this is just a bulky waste of material, that you'll be throwing away when the fluid runs dry, so grab a match instead."
2,Lumiere is below average,"I was quite pleased when I first got this product. It is kind of hard to light, but this is a good child safety feature. It has a sleek design with a good reach and we found it to be quite useful for about 2 months, until it ran out of gas. Surprise, no refill!For this price you should be able to refill this product. I now feel like I was ripped off. I won't be buying another."
1,People Proof,"This product is touted as Child Proof which is great, but I have a senior citizen parent who purchased this and didn't have the strength to click this lighter. Even I had trouble getting it to work most of the time and I have no grip or strength difficulty."
2,Not refillable,"This lighter is great and I loved it up until it ran out of fluid, which took about two months. I can't find anything like it that is refillable though. All of the refillable ones are straight and I prefer this. I wish they would make a refillable version."
1,NOT REFILLABLE,"This lighter, nicely designed as it is, IS NOT REFILLABLE. It may last you approximately two months, then you're faced with an empty lighter. NOT REFILLABLE!!! ANOTHER PRODUCT FOR THE LANDFILL. Hey BIC, think of the environment...or a refillable model."
1,piece of junk,"This lighter is a piece of Chinese junk-pun intended! It lasted about two weeks before being completely useless. No spark, no flame."
3,Pleasant folk-rock album in Innu language,"Kashtin is two singers of Quebec Innu descent who sing in the Innu language. The title track here was included on Robbie Robertson's excellent ""Music for 'The Native Americans'"" album. It's a fantastic track, even though this re-mixed version removes Robertson's guitar solo. The rest of the album is pleasant folk-rock, though none of the other songs is remotely as memorable as ""Akua Tuta"". My favorites are ""Tshekunu Mak"", ""Ne Puamun"", and ""Ashtam Nashu"". Manu Katche, who has played a lot with Peter Gabriel, is the drummer on several tracks, and Robertson contributes a backing vocal.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
2,Windows Media Only Digital Copy? What the Heck?,"I liked the movie, but what really disappoints me is that the Digital Copy is only Windows Media compatible. Now to be fair, it does say so on the package, if you squint real hard and look at the fine print on the back. I've taken up the habit of buying movies with digital copies because I've got a lot of room left on my iPod, this is the first time I've run into this problem. Other movies I buy offer a Mac or Windows version, as was the case with ""The Dark Knight"" (say, wasn't that a WB release too?). As for the movie, the animation is the best I've seen from any of the DC Direct to DVD movies. This has the potential to spawn some sequels, and if they keep the quality up I hope they do. So anyway, I liked the movie, it is much like an intergalactic cop movie, the digital copy shaft still hurts though."
5,Green Lantern!,"I read some of the reviews on alot of these videos and I have to say...Some people have too much time on their hands. I used to read comics looong ago and have watched some of these on catoon network, so I bought them. What else can you say? They are cartoons and are meant to be enjoyed; not critiqued to death for not being what some people think they should be....Anyhow, this was a fun movie and it is definately meant for an older crowd. Pop it in and enjoy!"
2,Disappointing...,"As a GL fan as well as a DCAU and DCU fan, I was extremely excited when I heard that Green Lantern was going to get his own animated movie. I made it through little more than half way when I realized that this movie isn't exactly all I was hoping it would be. After struggling though the rest of this ""masterpiece"", I came to the conclusion that, to me, this was a really boring movie!I could go on and on about what I didn't like about this, but I'll spare you all. One thing I did enjoy was the voice acting; Christopher Meloni as GL was especially inspiring, as was Victor Garber as Sinestro and Michael Madsen as Kilowog.Other than that, the story was underdeveloped and dull, and the characters themselves were as well. Plenty of action, but not much of anything else.""Green Lantern: First Flight"". This flight needs to be grounded, permantently."
5,green lantern first flight,excellent movie if you like comic book movies or action movies this is the one for you good special effects well worth getting even if your not a huge comic book fan this movie has a good storyline i recommend for sure
3,Fast delivery of item,"I got the item in good time before the etsimated date for delivery. The item it self is was good shape, but I couldnt use the item in my DVD player because it was designed for US and northamerica zone only. I was told this before I bougth the item. So it wasnt any suprise for me. But item work great on DVD players with none disc free zone or players who are designed for zone 1."
2,Green Lantern Blu-Ray,"Not a great film, the Justice League (specially season one) are much better.The story line could have been created with more interesting parts. I know this is a ""cartoon"" but I expected a more grown up one, this one seems very childish at some points.The Blu Ray version was not ""mind blowing"" like others (Battle for Terra, Serenity, etc.) so not worth it."
2,No Passionate love story,"Ok, at first the story was very interested, I was hooked on the first two chapters, then it go very tedious, the story leaves you feel cheated, the only best character is Ophelia, she is very self centered she is the bad guy. But it seems like the two main characters just ignored each other. Duncan could have been more a man and fought for Sabrina, and Sabrina is too forgiving."
3,Not up to expectations.,"I used to enjoy reading anything from this author, but lately her books do not seem up to her usual talents. This one was hard to get into, and hard to stay in to."
3,Different,"It wasn't your typical Johanna Lindsay. I thought it was great...me being a Lindsay fan and all. But it went too easy and the romance was slow and then i didn't feel that crazy chemistry she usually has between her characters. Usually there's an amazing pull between the characters that you can't help but feel. I felt there was more potential in Sabrina with Raphael than Duncan. But it made me smile and laugh at certain points. It was really a good read, there were just a few elements that were missing that didn't make it bad, it just made it different than her usual style."
1,The Heir,"I have read all of JL's books and I think this is the most boring book I've read in a long time. The characters can't stand up for themselves and are extremely gullible to let the Ophelia's of the world manipulate them. The love scene was quick and made the characters seem very juvenile. There was no build-up to understand why they were attracted to each other, was it because she makes him laugh, because she was well endowed? That's pretty shallow! This story primarily takes place over one week of eating and dancing, not a good setting or amount of time to learn about the characters. Both the scandal and the kidnapping were dumb. The overall story lacked any depth and you never bond with the two main characters."
2,A Yawn,"Duncan MacTavish is the heir. He has been betrothed by his grandfathers to a selfish, self-centered, mean-spirited beauty who is not to his liking. Instead, Duncan is drawn to Sabrina (a plain Jane with wit and immense integrity with ""drop-dead"" gorgeous violet eyes.) Duncan's strength of character and wonderful Scottish brogue are a winning combination. This reviewer had a ball in the beginning, feeling the rhythm of the dialogue roll off the tongue. However, ""tongue play"" was not enough to maintain interest in this story. About one-fourth into The Heir, and it ceased being a ""page-turner"" It does not come close to the mettle of a Johanna Lindsey story. There are no sparks flying between the two amorous characters. The dialogue is mediocre with a few bonfide retorts. This reviewer expects more than this lethargic story, especially with the hard cover prices. Sad to say, but The Heir was a yawn."
1,Can't believe it...,"The first Johanna Lindsey book I didn't LOVE, and I can't even tell you why because I couldn't finish it. I'M SORRY!"
2,MY REVIEW,I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK I EXPECTED MORE FROM JOHANNA LINDSEY SINCE I PRACTICALLY OWNES MOST OF HER BOOKS. THE ROMANCE ON THIS BOOK IS BASICALLY BEEN STUFFED IN A FEW CHAPTERS... THE REST OF THE CHAPTERS BASICALLY DEALS WITH THE FEELINGS OF OPEHELIA OR ON HOW TO DEAL WITH HER ETC.
1,Don't waste your money,"I've read quite a few Lindsey books and she is my favorite romance author but this one was one of her worst. There was no fire between the romantic leads - there was too much talk of ""friendship."" The hero didn't lust after the heroine. The story was really poor. There was no witty or teasing banter between the lovers and the heroine was pretty much a doormat."
1,The Heir,"Very drawn out, not enough passion or romance. I was bored waiting for things to come together. Kathleene Woodiwiss is the queen of historical romance. Glad I only bought two books."
1,shocked,I was shocked when I got my order. It was one piece of carbon paper. the cost to ship it was three times more then the product cost. and it was only the size of a charge card. to send it back would of done no good. the cost was stupid. First time I have ever felt ripped off.. Very disappointed.. No reason for this to happen..
1,Poorly made with Poor quality material,"This item had a horrible smell as you opened the package.The material was infused with a stink that wouldn't go away.I washed it. It fell apart despite the fact that it was ""washable"".The zipper never worked. I threw it away."
2,Already covered in What's New Guide,I was disappointed in the depth of the material. I had already read the What's New manual and found much of that repeated here.
1,Thats retarted,Dont waste your time with this. not only is the acting poor. but they totally screw up scrappy doo's well known part in the cartoon. and its just lame. an unbelievable. they try too hard to be funny.
1,"Great for Drunks, Retards, and Kids","Boy, this movie was pure junk, imagine the brady bunch meets Hong Kong Fooey and this is what you get. The script was probably written by an exec who was only thinking about money and not realizing that in order to make entertainment work, it has to ""entertain"". The list goes on about how to make a better movie but it will never happen since people are gobbling up this poo by the truckloads. And I should mention that Scooby is one of the stupidest creations ever made from a computer, he makes Jar Jar from Star Wars look like a dirty sock hand puppet."
1,Scooby-Don't,The only good part of the movie was the animation for Scooby. Other wise they took moderate actors and made them very bad actors. Maybe that means they are good actors by being sooooo bad.Don't buy this movie for yourself. Buy it for the White Elephant gift exchange at your next Christmas party.
2,ehh,"This movie is kinda dumb. i only like the parts where scooby goes ""ruh huh"" or says ""raggy"". but overall dumb movie"
1,unwatchable cash-in,"This is an unwatchable big-budget attempt to cash in on a ""classic"" TV show. Yes, it's got big budget over-the-top effects and sets. Actually, I was surprised they didn't throw in a few more recognizable ""B"" actors (besides Buffy) to up the hype factor.The plot and pacing drove me to get up and leave the room with the movie running due to boredom. The characters were all unlikable, with the possible exception of Shaggy and the Scooby CGI. The burping and farting contest not withstanding.The attempts at ""clever"" adult jokes (pot smoke? etc) directed at the adults stuck watching this abomination were merely reminders that it is possible to make movies for kids that appeal to adults as well.Usually movies this mindless are teen sex or slasher flicks that at least have nudity or gratuitous violence to keep the attention.(..)Avoid at all costs!"
1,Horrible,This movie was horrible. I rented it instead of buying it (Thank God) because I still love the cartoon. I was hoping that it wasn't as bad as the critics said it was. The funny thing is...it was worse! The acting was horrible. The plot didn't even follow the cartoon formula. It was so dumb that I would have turned it off but I fell asleep. Save your money for something funny and entertaining like Monsters Inc. or something else. Do yourself a favor and rent this one.
1,Not even good for kids,"You are better off watching the Scooby Doo cartoons on TV. I rented the movie since when younger I used to watch the Scooby Doo cartoons and enjoyed them, I was also told that the movie had very good special effects. To make a long story short I fast forwarded most of the movie, My wife and my son did not finish watching it."
3,Pure Scooby Doo Fun,"This movie, even though it was silly, it still was good. It was better than I thought it would be. When I first saw the previews and saw that Freddy Prinze Jr. was going to be in it I thought, ohhhhhhhhh great, a Freddy Prinze Jr. movie(of course it was scarcasm) but when I saw it I thought is want that as bad as I thought it would be. Freddy Prince Jr. was pretty good."
2,Scooby Dooby Do NOT EVEN RENT THIS,"Like Maaannnn.It's just awful. Poor quality sound, Even worse story line.Throw [money] to get acouple big name actors and market market market market.That's how the money is made ,quite simple(arent we?)."
3,Better than.......,"I seem to remember this movie just getting killed by critics when it was in theaters. After watching the DVD I realize that it wasn't that bad. It all probably depends on whether or not you grew up watching the cartoon as I did. With plenty of inside jokes regarding the predictability of the cartoon, makes it more than a kids movie. Even a reference to how so many fans thought the addition of Scrappy-Doo was terribly annoying. A fun kids movie with enough self-depriciating jokes about the cartoon for those (now) adults that grew up with it."
1,"Raggy, This Is Awfool!!","Run as fast as you can from this one. Wow, what an opening line, right? Sorry, but this film gives new meaning to 'having my intelligence insulted'. Compared to other teen flicks of the day, this is a 'dumbing down' version of the Scooby Doo cartoon series (believe it or not). For some reason it is doing well at the box office as though the general viewing public wasn't very saavy on fine filmmaking and intelligent writing. Hmm (That was sarcasm by the way). The only bright spots are the dead-on performances of the 'animated' Scooby and Scrappy Doo and Matthew Lillard's portrayal of Shaggy. (Did I just say ""portrayal of Shaggy? Jeez...) With the plethora of fine films released every week, it is a shame to waste your time and money on such mindless dribble. If you have a six year old he will probably love it and you will be bored witless. *1/2 stars. Avoid if possible."
1,A bomb waiting to explode,"There are 2 types of SD Fans in the world. One which loved this movie, one that loathed this movie. SD fans will be quick to pick up on the ""homage/tribute"" (what the director likes to call it), which brings forward the idea that this is a ""great"" movie for SD fans. Wrong. The ""homage/tribute"" is washed away so quickly from the mind, as you are constantly questioning when would Shaggy and Scooby compete in a farting contest, or when velma would be dancing in a womens shower room dressed a bikini (A scene cut from the movie, as it was deemed inapropiate for a pg rating).As a stand-alone movie, this is one to avoid. As a movie for fan purposes, this varies depending upon how long you have grown up with scooby-doo, or if you can ever imagine your favorite saturday morning cartoon revamped, and forced to sell drug/sex humor to audinces"
3,"Almost painfully cheesy, yet still enjoyable enough.","My 11 year old loves this movie, but I thought it was, at times, painfully cheesy. However, what can we expect? It is based off a cartoon! I do think it is a good representation of the the cartoon characters set in a more realistic setting. It does have a good number of elemental surprises, which makes it something adults can enjoy."
5,"Easy to Read, Easy to Understand and Easy to Apply","This book was easy to read and interesting, a page turner. The author shares her personal story which I found to be inspiring. This book is written in a style that feels familiar and comfortable - not clinical. I feel that I am better able to evaluate what I am really looking for so as not to waste time with the wrong person."
5,Inspirational Words of Wisdom,"I found this book to be a great source of wisdom, with common sense, practical advice with heart centered, caring, woman to woman tones. Encouraging me to take a breath and take things slowly, step by step, was one of the pointers that I took from this book as valuable counsel. And learning a bit of the author's own journey lends a nice personal touch; it made me feel definitely not so alone."
2,this book was not what i was expecting,i expected bigger lies and bigger deciet but it just wasn't that. i mean the guy was wrong for not letter her have the house.
3,A Sad Tale of a Pathetic Man,"This is a unique tale with some very complex characters. As much as I wanted to feel sorry for the main character, I couldn't, because he knew what he was getting into when he married. The relationship between husband and wife was strange, and I always held out hope that something would happen to normalize it. At points the book became a little tedious, but all in all, it was memorable. This is definitely not a typical ""happily ever after"" book."
5,Listen to this book,Dennis Boutsikaris' reading of this book is wonderful. Ms. Shreve's use of the language of the day (which may appear stilted in book form) and the portrayal of society at that time are both brought alive by Mr. Boutsikaris' acting skills. He portrays Professor Van Tassel as a believable character of his environment notwithstanding his stuffiness. The lengths to which the Professor goes to keep his wife are shocking no matter what era is depicted.
3,A Very Good Read,"Anita Shreve is very readable. She writes this novel as her others - with intelligence, and a penetrating look into the human heart and motivations. Like some of the other reviewers, I agree that this one may be a little short on story but it is written as a ""memoir"" from the husband's perspective in a 3-day train ride. So the reality of that would not lend itself to a War and Peace type of novel. If you enjoy Anita Shreve, you will like this book a lot. So far my favorite is Fortune's Rocks."
1,"shreve's least successful,novel","This was a trite novel of no substance with a flimsy plot and dreary writing. There was nothing of interest in the first 3/4 of the book, and a mildly interesting fourth 1/4. If Anita Shreve had not written this novel, no intelligent reviewer would have praised it. I found it a waste of time and obviously a waste of money."
1,Big Fan but big Disappointment,"I just gave up half way through the book...the multitude of dull characters, the unappealing setting (old decaying rambling estate)being turned into some rehab center for juvenile delinquents and/or mentally illplus the plodding dialogue as we are introduced to each interminably as they ""meet"" Jane Marple . I gave up on page 87 not caring who got killed or who dunnit!"
5,A Book to Feed Your Dreams,"I'm in the planning stage for turning a small home office into a sewing room. This book contains both layout ideas and guidelines for determining appropriate heights for sewing, cutting, and pressing areas based on personal measurements. After looking for some time, I don't believe there's a better resource available to get you dreaming and designing!"
3,"Useful, but Not Great","This book is helpful but not as inspiring as I had hoped. There are many good ideas, but for me there was just something missing. I found a few things I will certainly include in my new sewing room but I did not find my dream sewing space in this book."
4,Neat ideas!,This book has lots of practical and attractive storage and usage ideasfor those who have a sewing room or large enough area in their homesor apt. to be able to really utilize them. I bought it for ideas that I mightincorporate into our tiny studio apt. A few may work out; time will tell.
5,Excellent album. A must for any early sixties or Ventures enthusiast.,"All the tracks were swingin'! These are the kinds of tracks not found on ""greatest hits"" albums or for download. The ""Lolita"" theme was really good."
3,A short thought provoking read,"This is a good short book that highlights some of the fundamental strengths of Christianity as they relate to September 11th. It provide a good philosophical view of how we as Christians can help bridge the gap. Warning, Mr. Zacharias is an intellectual and you'll need to bring your A game to truly absorb the philosophy behind his thoughts."
2,Rather pointless,"International word lists were an interesting appendix to 1995's ""The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design,"" but two years earlier were put together for this book. It presents Windows 3.1 terms translated to 14 languages, sorted both by alphabet and by category. These lists seem a big waste of space, especially as they're also present on an attached diskette. However, first thirty pages slightly redeem the book, containing a condensed round-up of popular and obscure graphical elements of Windows 3.1 -- with a lot of illustrated examples."
3,Too small,"I ordered this costume for my 8 year old daughter who wears a size 8 in most things. So, I ordered this costume in a ""m"", which was to be an 8-10. The costume is not long enough and the wig almost doesn't fit. Also, the wig came in a complete mess. Furthermore, the elastic ""straps"" on the dress are dingy looking...perhaps to be flesh colored, but they just look dirty to me. If that is not enough, the ""boots"" are very difficult to get on. She is happy, so I guess that is what matters. I think I would have been happier if I would have gotten the ""L"". Regardless, Halloween is right around the corner...not enough time to start over."
1,horrible,please do not waste your money on this like I did. poor video quality and all at night...seemed like it was filmed a decade ago by a 16 year old.
4,There are some great songs here.,"This is the only John Prine album I've ever really listened to, but it's a good testament to his abilities as a songwriter and musician, and a good advertisement to make a person want to hear his other work.""The Sins of Memphisto"" is a terrific, upbeat song about growing old and gaining regrets.""Unlonely"" and ""You Got Gold"" are happy, hopeful, beautiful love songs.And ""All the Best"" is a slightly bitter well-wishing to an old flame, and may be the album's best track.""I wish you loveAnd happiness.I guess I wishYou all the best.I wish you don'tDo like I doAnd ever fall in loveWith someone like you.""All of the songs tell stories (though some are cryptic), and almost all of them are good. Some I could take or leave. Overall though, this is a good collection of songs, and John Prine's voice and the songs and arrangements are all very worth listening to, and all worth getting to know."
5,My missing years,"How could I have missed John Prine all these years. I have always like Kris K. and the resemblance is eerie. Nice tuneful, fun songs..especially a Big Old Goofy World.Have already bought three more of his Cds"
5,modern classic,"It's not by Crockett Johnson but I can't tell the difference and neither can my daughter. Harold imagines what it would be like to be as small as a ladybug, how fun!!"
5,Great watch!,The only thing that is missing is a stop-watch. But any way you won't find stop-watch in any Polar watch... (As far as I know..)
1,Avoid this Item,"In spite of the review above claiming the adapter was not functional on receipt, I ordered it anyway. It was easy to install which leaves no room for a bonehead error. It simply did not work. How could Canon not know something like this? To my credit I didn't try a second one. You should avoid trying it the first time"
2,Disappointing,"This CD includes some of the finest brass playing that I have heard. Unfortunately, it overwhelms the vocal parts especially in the Palestrina mass."
5,A Wonderful Treasure of Love,"I love Barthomew. He is truly a ""gentle brother"". I have read many books by channeled entities and can really feel a deep love from Bartholomew. He offers many exercise that will help you to see that you are all ready enlightened. His great love for humankind is generous spread throughout all of his books and I feel so inspired after reading them. I read a little each morning before I start my day and it starts me out with a perfect loving feeling that I can carry with me and spread to everyone throughout the day."
3,MISSING PARTS & RUSTS QUICKLY,"Good idea, but the product packaging is terrible. Two critical bolts not included, but I found acceptable replacements at my local hardware store. The chrome rusts very quickly. We do store it outside, but it has never been rained on and the chrome rusted within two weeks. Our son likes it, but it is very difficult to turn with the front wheel locked and even more difficult to push it straight since the front wheel wobbles a lot."
1,Save your money,"This ""documentary"" is poorly filmed, poorly written, and poorly edited. The disjointed scenes and unrelated commentary make for an irritating experience. The movie offers very little information and has no coherent flow of ideas. Wholly disappointing"
5,A wonderful glimpse into a fascinating part of the world,This DVD set is an excellent overview of Asia. The photos are captivating and the story line enlightening.
4,Entertaining,"Decent character development and interaction. Moves a little quickly at the end. Good balance of action and drama. Pretty good story.Overall entertaining. I'd say it's good for a child 12+. Action and some human on dragon violence with some very minor alcohol consumption and tobacco use. I believe there was a little bit of crude language as well, but nothing too serious."
4,Pretty Straightforward Stuff,"This was a bit different than one expected. There was no nonsense, no tongue-in-cheek humor or special-effects just for the sake of it: this was simply a humans vs. dragons story taking place in the future. No laughs and nothing hokey, which is what I expected. They played it straight, simply as a fight story between the two parties.Yes, there were credibility problems with the story but overall, it was good escapist adventure. The dragons were realistic-looking, the scenery dreary but the story interesting and intense in spots.I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a night of adventure on film. You could do a whole lot worse, especially with two young actors who have arrived as stars: Christian Bale and Matthew McConnaughey."
3,There be dragons there,"Battling dragons was a story told in legends of knights in the dark ages.The old maps had at the edge of the known world:""There be dragons there"".They actually found flying reptiles in the fossil record in the very far past.Here a cave in a London underground excavation is uncovered: the sleeping dragons rise to bring down man.The last hope of man seems to be a small band of dragon slayers.Only one man knows where the original cave lair is, where the only malemakes his home.Some need heroes, but others are born to it.It is a fun movie that blends legend with adventure in an strange new future."
2,Not a very good movie.,"This plot didn't make a lot of sense. We are told dragons have taken over the skies of earth, yet we hardly see any flying around. I rented this because Gerard Butler is in it. He has the best lines then gets killed off. Christian Bale has an angry expression on his face for the entire movie, I bet he was sorry he signed the contract. Matthew McConnaughy chews up the scenery with gusto, he looks like the only one having any fun. If the dragons only eat ash, why do they chomp on people? This is for hardcore sci-fi/fantasy fans only."
3,"It was ok, Gerard Butler's appearance just made it Better",I would not have liked this movie so much if Gerard Butler had not been in it. As usual he made this movie watchable with his charm and talent. It was an 'alright movie'. I only bought it because I am collecting Gerard Butler's movies. But he was not in it as much as I would've liked.
4,Decent Movie,"Reign of Fire is a decent movie. Way better then movies that made a whole lot more. Wish it would make more money. Anyways, the movie is pretty good considering it wasnt anything like I thought it would be. Like a whole lot of people I thought the movie was going to be all action. It wasnt, but I still liked it. It never really slowed down and it kept a pretty good pace. Good movie. You should see it. Its at least worth a rent."
2,NO WAY !!!,"Simply Put, click to the next page and spend your money on something else!!!Poor writing, sad plot, this movie fails at everything they attempted (except the dragons they were cool)"
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"A post-apocalyptic thriller that substitutes dirt and grime for any inkling of logic and probability, Reign of Fire features shirtless one-upmanship at its finest. The cigar stub chomping Matthew McConaughey is finally chiseled into Mt. RiffTrax, making a gutsy bid to become the hardest working shirtless man in show business since The Swayze himself. Playing the Keanu-esque foil to McConaughey's Swayze, Christian Bale returns every hardened stare, lets no machismo go unanswered, no muscle flex go un-flexed back at, and he'll be damned if he puts a shirt on either. For good measure, the writers also toss in a few dragons, and hint at the existence of thousands more. It's an old fashioned post-apocalyptic dude-off, both on the screen and in the recording booth, as Kevin Murphy joins Mike Nelson for what is sure to be your newest favorite RiffTrax involving dragons."
3,great dragons but little else to recommend it,"This sure seems like it should be a winner, and as someone who enjoyed all the Mad Max movies and who likes Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale, I was prepared to be thoroughly entertained, but this was a mess that started out well and then deteriorated. Strangely enough, things seemed to grind to a halt when McConaughey's character (Van Zan) enters the picture, so to speak. And who thought it was a good idea to take a good looking guy like McC and turn him into a bald cigar-chomping neanderthal? The dragons were excellent and the sets and design were great, but the script and plot needed work.DVD extras include a trailer, a 12-minute conversation with director Bowman, a 15-minute making-of featurette and an 8-minute sfx featurette. The film can be heard in English or French and subtitled in English or Spanish."
2,The best part about this movie is Matthew McConaughey.,"The movie is very slow. It just drags on and on and some of the scenes don't even make sense, or at least I missed it. The best part about the movie though, is when Matthew McConaughey steps in. He's sporting this grungy beard and shaved head. He looks tough and its sexy. He's really buff in this movie too. So if you're a big Matthew McConaughey fan, watch it, otherwise skip it."
3,Why did they end it in such a stupid way,Please tell me why. I don't understand. Great movie until the end. Worst ending to a great movie since Planet of the APes(new one). Where are the special effects people at? Hello! Wake Up! And do your job. A sequal must be done with a cool ending.
3,Great for the kids!,"This is one that the kids will really love. It has great special effects and reasonably decent acting, however, it doesn't live up to all the advertising it was given. It has several points in it where, they started something but did not finish them. The accents were a little hard to understand. Overall, not a bad movie, it just didn't live up to it's potential in my opinion. I would only buy this one on DVD because my child really liked it."
2,Good idea... bad execution,"I saw the trailers for Regin of Fire and thought: cool - a movie about dragons and fire! that should be fun.Well, yeah, the concept is great, but the execution was terrible. If they weren't going to make the plot even remotely interesting, the least they could have done was make the movie wall to wall action, ya know? Seriously, kicking dragon butt for an hour and a half would be entertaining when you are in the mood for that sort of thing.Special effects were not all that great. Didn't stink, but not good either. A lot of really interesting ideas and concepts, but none of them explored at all. The movie seemed like one big brainstorming session - a lot of good nuggets, but nobody bothered to pick out the good ones and expand them into a good moive."
3,Perpetual Resurgence,"This double CD will undoubtably get anybody into the ""flow"". A smart mix of Techno drum and bass beats smoothed out into a tranquil state of hip-hop."
3,Some great songs but spotty,"the album is worth getting for the title track and ""police brutality."" the concert favorite ""drink drank drunk"" isn't bad either. but the non-political songs are poorly written and performed for the most part. the next album (""new kind of army"") is far superior -- and not surprisingly all political."
5,"you gotta die,gotta die,gotta die if you don't like this CD","Anti-flag is one of the few truly punk-core bands that are still running these days,and this is one of their greatest albums,maybe the greatest AF album of all times...that for sure suckas,and you can find them in Fat Wreck Chords,BYO and a bunch of independent labels out there mija!...so buy it or steal it from a punk guy who often likes to forget stuff....."
2,True Punk?,"No I did not give this albut a two because they write things that go against our goverment, i could care less, i gave it a two because the music is bad and the lyrics are atrociouse, ive crapped out smarter sounding usless political dribble than that. Anti-Flag is not what id call true Punk, more of the We Are sooo more punx than you!!!! punk, mostly just whiney and hypocritical crap they have been spewing for years."
5,An album I could imagine Emma Goldman and Ward Churchill slam-dancing to!,"Besides being really awesome activists and talented punk rockers, these guys are totally hot! I'm sure that some of you homophobes out there will cringe at that remark, but oh well, get over yourselves. What can I say? Mohawks and righteous politics turn me on. More accessible than earlier anarcho-punk bands like Crass or Conflict, Anti-flag is bringing radical punk into the 21st century. Imagine a younger, cuter Noam Chomsky playing an electric guitar and you'll get an idea of what this band is about. Fans of Propagandhi will love this album. Angry, passionate, and committed to social change, this is a band you need to hear, a band that truly speaks to the real concerns of my generation, a band using their talent not to pacify the masses but to encourage them instead to fight for a better world."
1,Bad,"this is one of the worst CDs i have ever heard. Not only is the music horrible, it plays like a social studies class gone bad. the members of Anti-flag should be deported for making such a bad CD."
2,Doesn't hold up very well,I love the pattern and the colors. But after having washed the blankets 2 or 3 times they seem to be falling apart. They have faded and gotten little pills all over them. They aren't as high quality as I had expected.
1,Poor Quality,"The blankets are small, cut crooked, and very thin. Over priced and poor quality if you ask me."
3,Great Animation... but...,"For months I had been anticipating the release of this movie. I knew it was French, but I just had to give it a look-see. This movie, although charming and beautiful in the beginning, quickly begins to wear on you by the middle. Many of the scenes could have easily been cut by at least half. This movie would have better been suited as a 32 minute short, rather than a feature motion picture. I admit the story of the triplets of Belleville (New York), could have been captivating, but was instead, tedious and boring by the end. If you view the first five minutes of the end chase and fast-forward straight to the end believe me you aren't missing much! But if you love great artwork and a lack of dialogue, this movie is for you."
2,good song,"Didn't like the American jabs, particulaly by the french, although if it wasn't by the french it would be funny. But before you have time to relax and laugh theirs another joke at our expense. The statue of liberty wasn't voluptious, she was fat to represent ""Bellville?"" The sound effexts were interesting, the story obviouse, the animation was good."
2,Well&#65533;,"Lordy, I read all these reviews and wonder what I missed. This clever little thingie just didn't hold my attention, and I stopped watching after about 35 minutes. Sorry, folks, but whatever is so allfire wonderful about this, um, movie-cartoon-animated whatchimacallit just sailed right over my head."
3,Great Animation,"The movie has awesome animation, but it's too long. The story is bizare, and the fact that there's no dialogue is a little bothersome. My DVD had no subtitles."
2,"Rubbish, foolish nonsense","Call me unsophisticated or even uneducated if you will, but the truth is: I didn't like it! The storyline is rubbish, foolish nonsense, without the excuse of being a movie for children. The characters are almost grotesque, in the edge to bad taste. Some caricatures of famous people are supposed to be funny, but they aren't. On the bright side: the music is great and the background scenery is excellent, with very exquisite color palettes."
3,Visually stunning though this DVD doesn't do it justice,"Directed and written by Sylvain Chomet, ""Triplets of Belleville"" takes you to a awesome journey of gratifying animation, portrayal of cynical characters, and wonderful background music that is reminiscent of 19th century.**This movie is a definite keeper but you should buy the Collector's edition if you have seen it already.[....]"
2,Rent the movie before you buy it.,"Ok, I watched this movie again and again to try to understand it. I guess after watching this movie three times it's ranked as an ""ok"" movie. The movie was very racist and the animation was just grotesque and the plot was very, very, hard to follow. The movie just seemed too unrealistic. But, I guess it was just ok nothing special. The only part I really did find entertaining was the song. I guess this is a movie you would only want to rent, not buy."
1,We Get It.,"Note to pretentious snobs: It's entirely possible to ""get"" all the references in a movie, to grasp the director's point, and still not like it, still remain unimpressed. Cut the patronizing crap already."
4,Catch this rare gem if you can,"Triplettes de Belleville is a charming animated adventure not to be missed. In its celebration of parochial French life and simple pleasures, and its disdain for crass Americanization, it pays homage to Jacques Tati, whose films -- in particular Jour de Fete -- are given nods here and there.This is a joint French-Belgian-Canadian-British effort (forgive me if I missed anyone out), and there is a calculated appeal to an international audience -- little dialogue, and some English in there (perhaps specially recorded alongside a French soundtrack, another homage to Tati?).The animation is impressive, full of ingenious touches. It is a delight to see this type of old-fashioned cartoonery again in this post-Toy Story cinematic era."
3,Bizarre,"I found this bizarre and somewhat boring. The art is good if not necessarily pleasant and the subject is certainly original. I found that I was hoping that my husband would say, ""This is boring, let's watch the other film."" He did not. I had originally wanted to see it because of the music, but that grew tedious."
5,MCS Rocks,"How often do you see rock albums that have all stars? I don't mean my own rating, but at the time I am writing this MCS I am the Movie has a perfect review, and there's some meaning to that.MCS is a totally new sound, creativity, and engaging style that is FINALLY breathing some new life into rock bands. Rock bands are a dime a dozen, and every one of them thinks they have what it takes- but the problem is they all sound the same, and most are not pushing forward with a new sound,but copycating all the old bands we love. This CD is a totally new experience and fun, and in the tradition of old rock with a new flair....Wait can you say the word flair in a rock album review? This CD has something that most everyone will like. Very good quality music, songs, and sound."
2,Disappointing,"Two good songs (Light of Day and This Means War) are not enough to save this rock and roll movie. Joan Jett's acting consists of reading her lines with a face fixed in a snarling sneer. or is it a sneering snarl? No matter. Michael Fox will try to fix it all with his unwavering look of quiet concern and a few bobs of the head.There is, I'm sure, a good movie waiting to be made about bar bands in gritty rock and roll clubs. Unlike Light of Day, it will have characters we can care about, acting that we can believe in and some development that makes a difference in the characters' lives.A man ten rows behind me in the theatre where I saw Light of Day fell asleep and snored through the last half of the movie. No one bothered to wake him. Just jealous, I guess."
3,impressive.....(by Michael of Montreal),"Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett were fantasatic together as brother and sister in a struggling band called the Bar Busters.I recommend this movie for anyone who is into rock and roll....and also who likes drama films. i thought the songs in the movie were excellent and they also have the movie soundtrack for it, which im going to buy. One more reason why I love this movie is because its taken place in the 80's. The 80's rule !!!!!!!"
1,Worst Nightmare,"If you expeceted Asimov books like Robot, Empire and Foundation series, never mind about this book. This book don't worth the money and time. I am very sorry to say this, but this is the worst Asimov book i have ever read(I read all the Robot,Empire and Foundation series and i found them very well written) and more over, this is one of the worst sci-fi book i've ever read. This book doesn' have the logic that other Asimov books have shown, and the story is too plain, boring and very,very strange."
2,Snoozer,"This was the first Asimov book I've read and will most likely be the last. I was very dissapointed to say the least, especially with all the hype and notoriety behind Asimov's name. The first 3/4 of the book is basically just boring with no action or excitement. There's a few sparks in the last quarter of the book but they never turn into anything exciting. If your looking for a mildly interesting story about colonization, space exploration, and ethics then maybe this is for you."
5,Fantastic Book,I like the Issac Asimov. I lost all his books in the Ike flood. So I wll try to get on digital display.
4,Totally Surprised! Go this way to save $$$,"After having surgery, I was told to get Scar Gaurd to begin to heal the lengthy scar that I have. me being Carmel Toned, of course there would be a dark mark after a cut. I had purchased Scar Gaurd for about $27 at my local drugstore but Decided to try this tape for an alternate inbetween. After all the scargaurd only last for a week or two if you're using it twice per day and that gets Expensive! . When I wore this tape to a follow up appointment. My Dr told me that this was a GREAT Product and he can tell that it's working. I have recommended others who are getting the surgery that I had. It really does work. The only drawback is clining it. you know that sticky stuff when it turns and it's a bit gross trying to clean/scrape the gunk off but well worth the price!"
5,Classics From Britain's Pre-Beatles Instrumental Boom,"This is a pretty esoteric disc; buy it before it goes out of print. The Flee-Rekkers were a saxophone-dominated instrumental act who recorded in the U.K. for cult producer Joe Meek from 1960 to 1963. The saxes are honking and great, the rhythm section is amazingly energetic and tight and Meek ensures that the monophonic sound is interesting. Find out what the Brits were doing before the Beatles came along. It is not true that there was no original or interesting music coming out of that country before Merseybeat."
5,Convenient kit,"Excellent product. We take the Gorilla pod everywhere and it works great. If no one is around to take our picture, the Gorillapod can be attached to the camera and be placed anywhere. Can't leave home without it.For $22.00, I even got the extra tripod and the camera cleaning kit. Well worth the money."
5,good cover,Not much to say but this is the cover to get for the Handler 140. Fits great and feels sturdy. Will do the job.
3,A slice-of-life low budget erotic gem,"Once you get over the low-budget constraints, this is a naturalistic slice-of-life in one day/night of a group of teenaged friends. The actresses do a great job of being true people in whatever position they end up in, and the unassuming youths look like friends pulled off the streets to do this movie. You believe they truly are friends and you are happy to join in a romp that becomes more complex as the night progresses, but never cartoonish. No one remains innocent, and surprising character developments take place and you find you have conflicted views about the characters you've accompanied. Nice work. Yes, and there are some hot little scenes too. Hope these filmmakers can get bigger budgets next time around."
4,Good clean fun,"My 7 yr old grandson and I loved this film in theatrical release and we can't wait for the dvd to come out just in time for Christmas. Now remember this is not ""Citizen Kanine"" in movie making but a good clean entertaining film for all ages. The theme is ""Good vs Evil"" and some hilarious scenes make this film a solid 3 star movie but I added another star since I own a beagle, named ""Under ..."""
4,Great family movie,"I couldn't believe they made a movie on the classic cartoon under dog. I bought this for my 4 year old son, it was a hit. I don't know how many times he has asked to watch this movie. I even enjoyed it too. Good kids movie."
5,Napoleon's Mom,UnderdogOf course we loved the movie! We are proud parents to an 8 1/2 old beagle. The movie is fun and a great way to spend a little over an hour. Enjoy!
3,To share with kids.,"Got this to share with my granddaughter. I enjoyed it, and she REALLY enjoyed it. Grownups who want to spend time with children should consider this as a good idea."
5,I LOVE ROOMBA!,"I use Roomba every few days on my tile floor which has numerous rugs on it. Roomba picks up everything! One of the best things is the edge brush which cleans along the wall base ~ usually a painful task! Also, the fact that Roomba goes back to its charging station after its done is priceless! I leave for work and turn on Roomba; I get home and Roomba is charging itself. Too bad it can't empty it's own collector!! hahaha"
2,"works great, for a while...","Purchased this roomba as a remanufactured unit in order to save some dough. Died just after the very short warranty expired... Purchased a new one, 3 years later, still going strong. So, don't skimp, if you want one, buy new... The actual functionality: don't expect miracles, but for everyday ""touchups"" works well, missing tight corners..."
4,Easy to use - hard to maintain,"I loved it at first. Excellent cleaning since you are doing it more frequently now.The cons are it does get stuck over high pile carpet or carpet over wood floors. You have to MAINTAIN it. Continuously clean it since all these things get stuck in the rollers. Not a bad investment, but I wish there was an easier way to clean it."
4,guarantee,"I liked the item and would rate it with five stars. I rated four stares, because after two weeks, the fast charger broke and I couldn't recharge the Roomba. Fortunately there is guarantee on it and the helpline from iRobot was very helpful. I sent the Roomba back to them and it's just in the middle of progress for me to get a new Roomba in exchange. Hopefully everything will just be fine."
2,Didn't work,"I received it, it looked beautiful. I charged it, unplugged it, let it sit for a day before using and it didn't work. I tried recharging but it wouldn't take the charge. I returned it, Amazon was great about it. I bought a Bissel PerfectSweep. It's great for my needs and only cost $25.00 on sale. Lesson learned - be careful of remanufactured products. Someone else may get a good one but I didn't and it wasn't worth the hassle."
1,MISSING PIECES,MY ROOMBA CAME WITHOUT THE BATTERY PACK AND REMOTE. AFTER A FEW PHONE CALLS I ENDED UP MAILING THE ITEM BACK TO AMAZON - PREPAID - AND RECEIVED A NEW UNIT WITH ALL THE PARTS. CJH
4,It does make cleaning amusing,"The roomba does a nice job on my tile floors, and a decent job on carpet. It is helpful in that I can set it up and go do something else. My 10 & 7 year old sons also love to run the Roomba. They enjoy watching it roll under chairs and around obstacles (and the 7 year old encourages it to ""run free, little robot!""). Cleaning the filter & emptying it are both very easy. While my commercial upright vacuum does a better job on carpet, it does require me to operate it, so I'm inclined to run the Roomba more often. It's pretty quiet, too. I mostly bought it for my hard floors, and haven't been disappointed. While it doesn't clean the corners, it only takes a minute to use the dustpan & brush on them."
4,Great to have around the house!!!,"I'd have to say that though I was skeptical at first, this Roomba turned out to be a very good purchase. I just adopted a Golden Retriever, and the hair, oh the hair. But this guy does a pretty good job at maintaining the level of hair on my floor. Doesn't exactly do the job of a real vacuum cleaner, but REAL dang close. I'm very impressed and this was a good buy to just run every few days."
2,Return/Exchange Policy?,"Just bought a reconditioned Roomba Discovery 4210, and on it's third voyage it started making a loud grinding noise. I'll be sending it back to Amazon tomorrow, so we'll see how good Amazon's exchange policy is, and if the replacement vac-bot is any better than the first one."
4,Excellent concept...,"The Roomba does a nice job on hardwood floors. Still have to move things around and clear the room of ""non-friendly"" Roomba items, but it goes to work and cleans very well. When I initially receieved it, I had a heck of a time getting the battery to charge. I soon discovered that I didn't have it installed firmly enough. I believe that this was the result of what I consider very poor documentation. I believe a machine that appears to be this sophisticated needs better effort in presenting a more informative and interactive owner's manual."
2,I bot too Clever!!!,"Could not handle large areas well, I would recommend use on hardwood floors only. no rugs no cables etc and preferrably square."
5,Totally awesome!,"I bought the roomba robot for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves it. He says he just turns it on and it cleans everything. After it's done, it goes right to the home base and recharges itself. He hasn't programmed it yet to clean at certain times, but he may do that. Now I want one for myself! I'm tired of cleaning dust bunnies underneath the beds!"
2,Remainder Mark,Book has a remainder mark. Did not say that when ordered from Amazon. Would not have ordered.Bought as gift.
2,same old moves,"I found this record to be quite dull. The songs are fairly indistinguishable, with the exception of the Lee Ranaldo vocal. Thurston Moore should realize that his singing is tuneless and monotonous. Then there's the standard, shrill Kim Gordon rant--blah, blah, blah. The guitar chops are overly familiar as well--the repetitive picking patterns and the move-it-up-the-neck crescendos are getting pretty tired. For self-proclaimed Radical Adults this is a very conservative, uninspired release."
4,Good Youth,"Songs are expansive. The first three feature Moore, then Lee, and then some Kim. So much distortion it will blow your mind. I get the feeling the lyrics aren't as important on this one as the other records. The songs drone, crash, drench, and demolish their way through. It's also quite spacey. SY really focused on exploring their guitars on this one. If you're more interested in that sort of thing then this is your CD. Too few songs for my liking. Kim doesn't really kick her lyrics out their like before. Lee sounds somewhat unspired. Thurston sounds like he wants to free himself. The songs can get intense and then suddenly expand into trippiness. Good stuff."
4,Not nearly their best work but still pretty damn good...,"Named after the NY street where Sonic Youth's studio is located, this release goes off on less noisy tangents than they typically do. But if you're looking for noisy tangents there are a couple of 11 minute epics such as ""Karen Revisited"" and ""Sympathy for the Strawberry"" to sustain you. The first three cuts are almost radio friendly and contain my two favorite tracks from this CD...""The Empty Page"" which sounds like Neil Young singing for Television and ""Rain On Tin"" with a transcending guitar solo by Lee Renaldo. Of course Mission of Burma's sound is all over this as well as a touch of King Crimson in a few places. Not nearly their best work but still pretty good."
2,Wrong Author,They are marvelous subjects --- The Blessed Virgin and miracles and pilgrimages --- but what a shame that they have landed in the clumsy prose of a self-centered humorless untalented woman who's trying to get over the guilt of being a lousy mother.
5,"Finally, a human being on a spiritual quest",I truly loved this book. It is so true and so enlightened at the same time that it is funny and enjoyable ala Anne Lamott or Natalie Goldburg. This book seemed to me to be every ex-Catholic woman's search for what Catholicism means to her...what she can accept and what she cannot. What is abiding about our Catholic upbringing and what we need to throw out (If we haven't already.) I wanted to loan it to everyone I knew but I kept it to read again.
4,Mother Power,"Beverly Donofrio's love letter to the Blessed Mother of Jesus Christ is sometimes rambling and disjointed, but always interesting and often very moving. Mary's gentle pull upon her human children is vividly depicted through Donofrio's personal experiences and spiritual growth. Like any good mother, Mary uses our broken nature and countless faults to advance into our hearts and souls. In witnessing Donofrio's transformation unfolding through the pages of this book, I can only agree with her that Our Lord is very wise to put such a strong and persuasive presence as His Mother Mary on the front lines of the battle for souls."
3,Beverly on a tough road...,"While there are some wonderful spiritual words of guidance from believers and followers of Mary in this book, I cannot relate to Beverly Donofrio.One thing is certain, she will continue to struggle in relationships. She is finally on a path of understanding that she is....a mother. She learns and begins to embrace this as she becomes closer to Mary, the mother of Jesus. Bravo on that! Blessings on that!This path was revealed through so many attempts at finding her way throughout the course of the book.There were many things about Beverly's life that I would rather not have known.This is certainly not a role model book. It does however put forth our own unique struggles with faith and understanding.For myself, this was a decent read, but not a spiritually upflifing guide."
5,social unrest,"one of the best and most underrated REAL punk bands ever! i am glad to finally hear the album 'Now & Forever' on CD quailty, since my tape wore out about 10 years ago."
4,Beautiful Repackaging job....BUT,The quality of this edition is the reason to BUY cds these days. The packaging is a total part of the listening experience.BUT WHERE ARE THE LYRICS?!!The whole reason to BUY a hard copy of the CD instead of cheapo compressed downloads.
5,One of the all time best World War I Movies,"The Lighthorsemen, a remake of 20,00 Horsemen made in the 1930s, is one of the all time best WW I movies. The Danish Jewish officer who planted the false information that fooled the Turks and Germans is accurately portrayed by Anthony Andrews (known for one of the better performances of Ivanhoe). The charge of the Australian lighthorse at Beersheba resembles a photograph of the actual event that appeared in Military History Magazine. This is how to make a war movie. Movie producers pay attention."
4,Last Real Wartime Cavalry Action Will Give You a Charge,"This is one of those great movies the Australians put out about World War I, in which they transformed from a colony to a nation. Beersheba with its wells must be seized from the Turks to provide water before the allied forces succumb to the desert. The cavalry charge of the Lighthorsemen saves the day."
4,terrific,i wish cecil b demille would have produced the event. the book describes it with more detail.
3,I've been looking for this film,"I don't recall the quality of acting, direction or cinematography. However, I've been looking for this film as I saw it years ago and I'm very interested in the climatic charge. As I recall, the charge on horseback, against fixed defenses, was successful because of the strategy they used - having something to do with getting in quick so that they were below the range in which the enemy (Turks?) could depress their cannon. In any case, I plan to pick the film up at sometime in the future simply to exam that historical aspect."
1,Poor picture quality,Very poor picture quality. Very disappointed !My husband and I had really looked forward to viewing this movie.I have complained to the sender but they did not reply to me.Our evening was spoilt!! because of this event. June Ellison..........
4,Excellent Overview of the Process...,"I found this book very informative and to the point. Unlike many ""how to get rich"" authors, Irwin stays more on the task than on the ""rah-rah"" stuff. His tips and traps make good references for the uninitiated investor or purchaser. Best of all, his style is smooth and easy to read. If you're looking for a good ""getting started"" book, this is it."
2,Not for me.,"From this book, I learned the Famous Price-to-Rent Ratio and it comes to my mind everytime I preview a property. It will teach you the seven things to look for in a bargain. One of these items was new to me. Buying REO requires two things to succeed: expertise and money. This book can help you with the expertise part but if you don't have some investment cash...you probably should seek another income stream. Lucky for you (and me), real estate has several income streams to pursue."
2,A fun period piece,"This is a fun movie. It really is nothing more than an R rated (and not all that R rated) tv movie. But it's fun, harmless, and amusing. There are definitely worse ways to spend an evening than watching this pleasant movie."
3,not all are from the 90s,"It looks like a good album, but Here's to the Night was from 2001, All or Nothing and Breathless were from 2000. It's kind of like false advertising.That was when people of the 90s were celebrating the new millennium's arrival, which means 2000 and 2001 were in fact part of the 2000s.I was 21 in 2001, and I knew the 90s ended 2 years before..."
1,One of the worst movies ever,i can't believe how bad this is one of the worst movies ever this is not spirit this is just one boring journey about a crazy horse that babbles this is spiritless try justin bieber never say never it is 100% better than this one i just liked the music and that's all what a disappointment my children (ages 6 and 3) ad i were very angry and the next morning we threw it in the trash shame on dreamworks this should of been PG-13
5,...,"Love the music and the movie theme. Its show power of freedom and no one should be held back from that freedom, even wild animals born in the wild, and not in the zoo."
3,Not overly impressed,"This movie was so hyped up as a kids movie. It isn't for kids. My 6 year old does not like it and my 3 yr old runs out of the room. It's okay for adults and older children but too intense for a younger crowd. And for pete's sake, give poor ol' Sprirt a break! It's disaster after disaster for this poor horse. And everytime you turn around, there are the soldiers again and again. Not enough happy and care free moments but the animation and scenery are great. And kudos to no talking horses! Augh. I was going to buy it for my kids but I'm not gonna waste my money. Maybe in a few years they may like it."
4,Beautifully drawn,In 30 words or less...A great adventure story. Horses are beautifully drawn. All the situations Spirit gets into become a bit repetitive. 1 song too many in the soundtrack. Good family film.
1,Bryan Adams last stand,"This is quite possibly the worst animated feature I've seen in awhile.Not only are you subjected to a simplistic,unresearched, unrealistic,and predictable storyline,the constant Bryan Adams music is enough to make anyone want to run from the room screaming.If your looking for a few hours of total torture or something get rid of unwanted company this is the movie to see."
2,How ya like them apples?,"This film tries hard to be better than it is. The animation is striking, although a little too digital for my taste. The casting of Matt Damon as the voice over for Spirit was a TERRIBLE idea. This emblem of Western freedom shouldn't have a slight Boston accent.Despite my complaints, the movie isn't the worst thing ever, and my son (2.5 years old) loves it."
2,One-dimensional.,It has a simplistic storyline with one-dimensional characters. It is difficult to extract a clear moral value or message other than the horses are very-good and the people are very-bad. Perhaps it has entertaining value to small kids.
1,Totally Disappointing,"It has been a long time since I have been so completely disappointed in a movie. The trailers for this film made it look stunning. And the western landscapes are the one positive thing about the movie. But I was flabergasted as the scenes shifted from Yosemite to Yellowstone to Monument Arch as if these were all in the same neighbhorhood. I found it annoying.Byran Adams has written some good songs . . . elsewhere. The tunes in this film are insipid and all sound alike.The concept of having the animals not speak was an interesting one. Except that then Spirit speaks to the camera in voice over. What were they thinking?!!!! And as some one with a little experience with horses, the horse sounds were ludicrous.The minimalist plot will bore children and adults alike."
1,horse manure...,"Whiny stupid tree huggers may be happy,or any jerk who wants to make europeans feel bad,Well this movie just ticks them off.Reverse-racism????What's up with that???And ""animal rights""?What moron really believes that animals are good as native americans,or BETTER than white men??I don't buy it.Brother bear is even worse.Political correctness makes good movies utter CRAP.And don't even get me started on the new age mumbo-jumbo.I hope a lot of liberals view my review and begin whining about how politically incorrect this review.But we all know nobody really believes any of this(except for a few of those Los Angeles wackos...who I guess directed the movie anyway).Buy something less politically correct,even if you are a liberal."
1,Poor Movie,"Right, bad US soldiers beat and torture horses, while good Native Americans love and honor horses. Bad US soldiers slaughter Native Americans for no reason, while good Native Americans flee in horror.At least the movie was as balanced as my textbooks from grammar school (albiet in the other direction).Kids today need a more balanced picture, even if it is from a stupid cartoon."
2,I couldn't take the Bryan Adams soundtrack!,"Really, past about the hour mark, it became apparent that this was not a traditionally scripted animation film as much as it was a series of animated music videos, featuring Bryan Adams. Granted, one is to expect musicalisms in an animated feature aimed at children, but Adams' style and voice are not to my liking, and since my daughter eventually got bored and left the room, I popped the DVD out of our player and put it back in its case before it had the chance to finish.I was also annoyed by the ""White people = bad, Native Americans = good!"" meme. Thanks a lot for that. As if my daughter won't eventually get an earful of that sort of thing from her so-called Social Studies teachers when she hits school. We wanted something fun and entertaining to watch, not a postmodernized history sermon.Having said all this, the blended computer and traditional animation was professional and impressive.If only the soundtrack and story could have been likewise."
3,Didn't get to read it!,Afraid I cannot review this since I forgot to read it and it expired boo hoo. I may try to rent it again in the future because I have read the other 2 books in the trilogy.
3,The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,"Of the Steig Larrson book trilogy, this movie was the least exciting and a bit too ""sequel-y"". If you've seen ""the Girl w/the Dragon Tattoo"" and ""the Girl Who Played with Fire"" you MIGHT like the outcome, but getting there ... this movie may have been better had there been more time to deal with each character and their respective situations. In this third movie, you already know everyone so the only thing new is Lisbeth's outcome."
5,AMAZING Triology!! A MUST MUST watch!,"I could not stop watching this trilogy...watched at my home, one after another via Amazon Prime/instant feed. I was GLUED to the tv. Such a well-made film."
5,Excellent movie,This is a great movie...especially if you have seen the other two. Good to have all three. These are movies to re-watch...since they are mysteries...you can reflect on the things you missed in the first viewing.
4,The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,I liked the books and have all the Blu-rays.I think Noomi Rapace did a wonderful job bringing her character to life.
1,the dubing was aweful,"Truthfully, I only watched the entire thing because I paid for it. I am oh so glad it wasn't that much. It needs to be remade ""American Style""."
5,The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest: Extended Edition,supreme storytelling and Rapace is incomparable. It is a guilty pleasure to be able to watch all three films in one setting.
5,Thrilling conclusion,This Movie is the thrilling conclusion to the trilogy of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The story is a compelling mystery that ties up the loose ends of this wonderful piece of work by Stieg Larrson.
3,"Too short, too fast, and too many psychos!!!","This is the third and final installment in this franchise. It represents the best effort to bring the book to film, and as a result, needed to cut some things out. I would argue that what it cut out did not leave this movie fatally flawed, but rather just ensured what the movie contained was not the compilation possible. It seemed to hurried and was little more than a collection of vignettes which featured the characters, but did little to link the story to other events. Still, the actors are great and the filmography is wonderful."
1,Not good,It was so hot I couldn;t eat it. I had to drink water after every spoonful. I did not like it
3,"Noodle soup, not noodle bowl","Like some other reviewers, I found this a timid spiced kimchi product. (Just goes to show - there's a huge variance in rating ""spiciness"" - I found it only moderately spicy.) It's a decent soup dish, easy to prepare, but there are other Asian quick-fix products that are better. Looking for kimchi? - not here."
5,Wonderfully Spicy!!!,"These noodle bowls are so tasty! I had previously purchased the Miso bowls from Annie Chun's, and I tried this kind on a whim. It is super spicy but you can still taste the other flavors of the soup. Great!"
1,CARDBOARD ANYONE?,Tastes like spicy cardboard. Really overrated product. I will not buy this again period. I don't recommend it.
1,If I could rate this any lower I would,This was the worst thing I have ever eaten. It made me sick. If I could rate this is the negative I would. I will never buy any of annie's poison noodles again.
5,Definitive Marley,"Without a doubt, the best and most powerful point Marley had reached was in the late sixties/early seventies. Duppy Conquerer and African Herbsman are tremendous Marley songs"
2,cheese ball,"Pretty cheesily made. Better off with other tonka products. The rubber tracks on the one item come off too easily and are just the right size to fit over a 3 year old's head like a collar. Not safe. They still have the toys, but the rubber tracks have been thrown in the trash. They have lots of other tonka stuff which have held up really well, but when your child comes running up to you with a rubber rope (track) around his neck, crying because he cannot get the thing off, I quickily became unimpressed with this toy."
4,"Decent overview, weak in some areas","I'm generally pleased with the quality of O'Reiley books and "".NET Framework Essentials"" continues that tradition.The material that's covered (COM+ Component Services, Message Queueing, ADO.NET, etc) is relevent and doesn't get too bogged down in details and is timely.I would have liked to see more coverage of the ASP.NET Web Controls, which is where this book is weak. But all things considered, it's worth the buy."
2,Poor quality,"I ordered this product and when it arrived it was cracked, so I requested to replace it and when the replacement came it too was cracked in the same spot. So, I got a hold of customer services to let them know that the product came to me both time broken in the same spot and they promptly refunded me my money. But if the product wasn't cracked it would have been a great item to have."
4,very good,"very good product. good value for money!!giving 4 stars because, sometimes it makes lot of noise.."
2,Disappointed,I have used mine for year and only about once a month. The knobs broke where the top connects to the base. I love the idea but this is is poorly designed.
1,Not very sturdy,"I used my chopper for a month or so, and when I was using it to chop an onion, one of the posts that the lid pivots on broke off. It is useless without both posts to hold the lid in place."
3,chopper weak points,"We have used this chopper for a long time,. This is unfortunately the third, as there is a weak point in the hinge. Due to the hammering on the top section, the hinge parts at the rear tend to break, and no type of cement or melting the plastic parts together will hold. It's a good item and does a nice job of chopping onions and other veggies, but just that weak point gives it a downgrade."
3,great until it breaks,"I've used (and broken) a couple of these. Both times the fault was with the plastic knobs where the lid hinges onto the base. If something, say an especially fibrous piece of onion skin, refuses to pass through the grid and you press too forcefully on the lid, it's very easy to snap the plastic hinge knobs or break the plastic around them and ruin the machine.Cheap design/construction aside, however, the product does indeed work as advertised and, if used with care, will save you some time and effort while producing a perfect dice. Despite the name, I've used it for much more than onions -- tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, eggplant, squash, etc. Also, we'd put ours in the dishwasher regularly (top shelf) and never had problems."
4,"Love it, but does take some effort","I love this thing. Makes quick work of onions and bell peppers. The other reviewers do have a point. It does take a bit of effort. I'm not a big guy, but I am a guy. I can understand how an older woman might not have as much fun as I do hammering down on vegetables.That the bottom section is graduated, allowing you to measure without transferring to another container, is a nice feature.Oh, and don't ever try to dice a tomato with this. It's not pretty. :)"
1,Cheap!!,I got this product and was making salsa and thought it would be great to chop up the onions and green peppers. I tried the green peppers and it wouldn't cut them. So I went on to try the onions - it broke!! This is the worst product on the market there is and should be stopped - what a rip off!!
5,time saver,"This chopper is hard to find in stores, easy to use and a must have if you are making a big batch of salsa or anything else you have to cut up. Best price and quick delivery. This is well worth the price. We love it!"
4,works,"I don't give 5 stars to things that I can really do myself. This tool saves a little bit of time and it's better than the way i chop, but is the price worth it? I still don't know. The product does what it's supposed to do."
2,"Hard to Use, Harder to Clean",This product is hard to use and harder to clean.Save your money and buy a small electric food chopper. They run for around $20.
4,Very useful,"I've had this product for about four years and use it often. I can't imagine what people are doing with it to make it break.I use it to chop and dice many items. Onions, celery, carrots, shallots, eggs... a variety of foods.It's easy to use and clean. I can't imagine cooking without it"
2,Onion Chopper Review,"Good thought, but when you put an onion on the metal crossblades and try to push down on the top handle thing it is really hard to do and the cutting mechinism doesn't work well. It seems to be sharp but does not cut the onion easily.I purchased this chopper for my mom who is 70 and she could not chop an onion with it. My kitchen aid chopper does a much better job as does my black and decker electric chopper and they are dishwasher safe also. I would not recommend it at all. There are other choices out there for good deals."
1,Great idea if it were made from stainless steel,"Like the other reviews, mine broke as well. I loved it while it lasted though."
1,"I am returning them, they were so bad.","I bought four of these items for holiday gifts & now have to find something else to give. One of them broke while being used for the second time. Another required my 220 lb. son to push down on it to get it to work. Neither I nor my daughters-in-law could use this product. One used my son's brute force, the other cut the onion into slices before chopping it which didn't save her any labor & just gave up & called the company to return it. Don't buy them."
1,Good idea ... but failure in execution,I purchased this item because I'd gotten tired of the onion chopping and tears that always accompany the task. The onions I use are always fresh from my weekly CSA box. Even after slicing these onions to put them into the chopper I broke it almost immediately.
4,great kitchen tool,"I have had my chopper for 2 yrs. now. I use it for everything - most recently discovered it chopped white chocolate into nice uniform sized pieces. If you want to chop onion, you need to slice the onion - then it works wonderfully. I love my chopper!"
1,Piece of junk!,I practically have to stand on it to get it to chop a piece of the onion. The holes are too small I think and maybe that's why it will not allow the onion to pass through. I love when I waste my money!
1,Watch your finger,cheap china copy cat product watch your fingers very carefully while using that otherwise you fingers will get cut
1,mold hazard,"The safe apparently gets its fire rating by having a moist clay between the plastic inner shell and the thin metal outer shell, a couple inches all around of moist fiberous clay like material. To bolt it to the wall you have to drill through the plastic the clay and the metal outer shell.This exposes the damp clay to the inner area. Mine molded, it has stunk up my grandmothers silver folders and the documents I had inside, this is not a good design, I totally would not recomend one of these Sentry Fire safe types to anyone, I have a couple of the non firesafe types and they are fine, I am going to have to throw this one out, totaly disgusting."
3,Sentry safe ds3410,I received the safe and the box was left at the side door. When I opened the box the safe must have been dropped and the top was dented pretty bad but the skin was not broken. The safe is 100lbs so I didn't repave and ship back but feel that I should have received a rebate for the condition. I called amazon and was told I must return item.. For the amount paid and the fact it seems to work fine outside of the cosmetic damage I didn't feel it was worth the effort. Like the safe don't like the response from amazon to it's loyal customer
3,Perfect Purchase,I am pleased to say that this was a perfect purchase. The safe arrived exactly as promised. It was exactly like it was advertised. I am very happy there were no complications replacing a damaged one so easily since I needed it quickly.
4,Decent safe at a decent price,"I'm no expert in safes and such, but I decided that for this kind of price (under $220) it would make sense to keep my valuable papers, etc., at home rather than at a bank. The safe is large enough to contain stacks of documents on letter-sized paper, and it has a handy shelf as well. I doubt that the combination lock would hinder an expert thief for long, but I'm satisfied that it's secure enough to stop anybody that's foolish enough to look for wealth in our modest home. The fire-proof feature is really the more important one. And the convenience saves me lots of nuisance tasks."
2,Useless for documents,"I bought this as a place to store sensitive documents (deed, account statements).I cannot fit any of the following in this safe:- legal-size papers- accordian files- laptopsThis renders it useless. Returning."
2,Skip this safe,"There is a reason this safe is cheap. I'm almost positive I could break into this safe in a couple of minutes with a regular hammer. If you just need a safe to prevent your kids from getting to your stuff than you're probably ok. I would send it back, but i'm too lazy. Purchase a different safe if you really want your valuables to be protected."
3,"Great hardware, but application barely there","After reading lots of reviews and comparisons I settled on this product despite the very negative reviews of its Beta AVer Media Center software. If I were to do it over I would have ordered a product which has a solid application included. I understand that it now works completely (including QAM digital tuning)with current drivers in MCE 2005 and Vista Media center...but I don't have either one and am now stuck with what AVermedia has provided. All it's good for is real-time viewing and manual recording. Forget about reliable scheduled recording. Also, the mpeg-2 digital tuner recordings are only viewable with the Avermedia Center. I have no sound when attempting to use any other media player. It has something to do with the AC3 encoding. I've contacted tech support for these two standout problems and while I received replies I received no fixes, either."
1,Unsatisfied,"I installed this card and the driver on an ABIT AW9D-MAX motherboard with a Intel Core2Duo processor and an iVidia GeForce 7900GT video card running Windows XP. On every repeated boot the computer would lock up after a few minutes. After removing the card, the computer is back to working fine. I personally cannot recommend this card."
1,Died after 2 years of infrequent use,"I bought this about 2 years ago and very soon I noticed hat it gets so hot that it freezes and it requires a reboot. I contacted AverMedia and they sent me a new one. After about 2 years with very infrequent use (a few hours a week), its digital decoder suddenly stopped working. It can still get analog channels.Subsequent calls to AverMedia didn't solve the problem as it is not under warranty anymore."
2,"Good basic info, very dated","Got this book to support my husband's taekwondo paper, and while the info is solid, just look at the date of the book.Purchased the book because another instructor swears by it, but there are lots of other resources with more detail and more recent info."
4,RV sewer kit,Works great Well made product Connectors on each end sealed perfectly and the varible stepped adapter makes for a good fit for any hookup.
3,took care of business,"Was ok but should of gotten the longer one, after 3 or 4 uses started to unravel because I had to remove elbow to store."
2,not so good,This product only lasted a little while. After about 4 months or so it wouldn't hold my cell phone. The spring SPRUNG! Good thing it's not too expensive!
2,Universal for the flip-phone world.,"My Samsung Stratusphere, just barely fits. And once it's in the vent, I'm not sure that I'll be able to remove it without breaking it,"
1,STRAIGHT JUNK,"Ad says fits droids..um no, the droid was to wide. My son tried to force it, causing it to snap like a twig. Thrown in the trash via open window of moving vehicle at 60mph. Ended up having to stop at Walmart and getting one that is stronger, definitly fits. I told anyone who would listen not to waste your time with this. You would have a better chance of holding your phone with ducktape on your dashboard than using this POS!!!"
2,universal car vent mount,"Initially happy, until it broke the second everything was out of the packaging. Considering the price, I should have realized it wasn't going to last long, but didn't think it was going to break before even getting to use it."
2,Car phone mount,This was not a good car mount if you have an iPhone. I could barely get it in the holder after I extended it as far as it would go. The sticky back that was supposed to stick it to your dash didn't hold up. It fell off after an hour.
2,breaks easy,Installed this universal phone holder in my car so that we could have it hold our cell phone. About the second time my wife took her phone out of the holder it broke. I am not satisfied with this product and want people to know about it so that they don't have to mess with the same problem.
1,"Not ""universal""","Recently my phone holder broke in my attempt to move it from one car to another. The image appeared to be similar to what I already had. To avoid the issue of relocating the holder from one car to another, I purchased 2 of these units. Unfortunately after receiving the item, I found that the clamping mechanism was not able to open wide enough to hold my droid like the old one did. I assumed that Universal meant that is was capable of supporting a wide variety of phones and apparently my phone is not one of them."
1,flimsy,"The sticky dash mount broke as I tried to remove it, one of the arms shortly afterwards. Also, it comes with no instructions, have to guess at orientation from the pictures."
1,maybe the worst movie I saw 2002,"I watched this movie at cinema. I expected maybe some funny india-joking. But this was plain dull. The only thing I remember was the girl I saw this with that I never wanted in the first place, but made out the whole second half of the movie because I had nothing else to do. It went straight to the videostores."
5,Bollywood romantic musical comedy,"I love this movie because it mixes the East and West in typical comedy and sensitivity.It is a movie that always makes me happy. I always have a laugh and the music and costumes are really great. I enjoy it every time.The Bollywood dance version of Grease is a blast and so is the scene at the Posh party when he has to pretend he is a Swami. Very creative.Marisa Tomei, as usual steals the scenes.Worth it every time.It also speaks of spirituality in a light and humored way, but makes its point."
2,I really am being to hate the video,The video is too long and she just repeats the same junk about 10 times. She does not even make it fun. It is the most boring workout tape I have ever seen in my life...
3,not for everyday,My son loved them. Shipping was fine. The only thing is the comfort of the shoe. They are more for casual wear. He wore them for gym class and his feet hurt all day.
5,second time,"that was the second time I ordered books from amazon.the itens I ordered, arrived in brazil right on the schedulled time, well packaged, no damages noted; both of them are new.along with ""the virginal conception..."" I ordered ""the birth of the messiah"", I'm a theology student, and the theme of the books are of great concern to my studies."
5,revelating,"I believe this book deserve 10 stars for the humor (if possible) and the clarity in which the growth of the fascism in Italy is described. Not in Rome, not in a major town in Italy, but in a small and relatively unimportant place (for the continent) that can be the beautiful Sardinia. This is a history (or perhaps a chronicle) of how the fascism took place in Sardinia, masterly narrated by Lussu with clarity and most of all the humor of who knew that things were only to get worse. All who claim they know about fascism should first read this."
4,Hat trick!,"This is the third of three strong releases. Guy Davis is here to stay--in his hands Delta Blues will continue to be a living creative musical genre--not a museum piece to be experienced only though decrepit recordings. He and Corey Harris now co-own this genre, at least from the male perspective."
1,Worst Sreen Adaptation of a Clancy novel yet,"I don't begrudge Tom Clancy creating further wealth from turning his stories into films. He was the Executive Producer of this movie after all. But this film is so politically correct, poorly cast and the screenplay so far removed from the actual story line of the novel, the DVD cover should have some type of disclaimer to warn Clancy purists. Either that or give it some other title so it can't be confused with the real item. About the only redeeming feature is the decent soundtrack music written by Jerry Goldsmith. The Sum of All Fears novel is one of my favorite Clancy books. This film adaptation was the worst of his works that have been made into a movie so far. Hollywood, being Hollywood screws up again..."
5,BlockBuster Hit,"Jack Ryan has been played by three qualified actors, each adding his own style and character. But in this movie hats go off to the author (again), the writers and the director.Very well done, people. Very well done. You surprised me by setting off a nuclear bomb in Baltimore. Wow. That's never been done before. And the aftermath was very well played out.This ends as all good movies should: good triumphs over evil, the guy gets the girl, and the red carpet for a sequel is laid down.And now I hear of yet another Tom Clancy movie is on the drawing board with Chris Pine (James T. Kirk, Star Trek 2009) slotted for the staring role of Jack Ryan. This will be good!May Tom Clancy live forever."
2,High Expectation Met With....Question Marks.,"I very regrettably asked my girlfriend to watch this movie with me.This movie consistently boggles the mind, but not in a good way. You'll continuously refer to these questions listed below:1. What's happening?2. Who's that?3. Where's this at?and near the end..4. What's in the friggin box?5. What the..... ?Everything is very anticlimactic, uninspired, and the story was unorganized and senseless in a lot of areas.Good action, good camera angles, just horrible chops in the movie.Whoever says this is a well made thriller or a good suspenseful film, I really don't know what to say to you. To each their own.By the way, NEVER....EVER....believe in a movie trailer again!"
4,"bad nuke,no plutonium","great movie,makes you think this could happen.great actor's good story line morgan freeman at his best as usuall.2 thumbs up"
3,A point of view from Russia,"I am an American Citizen currently living in Russia. Just today a Russian friend came to visit. He is home for a visit from some schooling in America. He had viewed this film and was more than surprised at the content as it portrayed Russia in the very negative roll. He, of course, has a different perspective of the Russian people, political and economic system than Americans do - and as I did prior to living here. But maybe although this is an entertaining, albiet not too correctly done, film the movie makers should look at the way they treat the international community. Russia and America are closer in lots more ways than we might think! But for technical theater it should absolutely get 5 stars. Also for entertainment. And since nuclear conflict was the plot, so be the story. Although I suspect that conflict between the two countries involved is long past! So goes Hollywood and its stars!"
2,Wait until this movie is a dollar rental,"This movie was very long and drawn out, building and building for what? The climax never came, or at least was so miniscule I was left wondering, was that it? I was very disappointed that they had Morgan Freeman bow out so early too."
3,Just OK,"Great actors, just was not a great movie. It had its moments. Glad I didn't pay up the the HD version."
5,The Sum of All Fears,This is an excellent movie! I would recommend it to anyone. The actors did a great job and there was a lot of action in the movie.
2,patriotic/idiotic,"at first i thought that ""red october"" was destined to be the least plausible (scottish russians speaking english) and overall, most HOLLYWOOD clancy movie made to date. BOY was i wrong!!! BEN AFFLECK does an admirable job looking good for the camera. Huh? plot? We all know that the Jack Ryan character is always in the right place at the right time, and holds all the cards, and fights doggedly against impossible odds and unknown opponents, but this movie was such an obvious reaction to the attacks of 9/11 in such a patriotic and ignorant sense that only the recent COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TEARS OF THE SUN or AIR MARSHALL are more offensive."
4,A good movie,I was very happy with Amazon and it's partner as to the speed and quality of how everything went smoothly. I received the DVD in a timely manner and was pleased at the price for the entire experience.
1,Hollywood is a criminal,"This movie does not even deserve 1 star. This movie is long, boring and predictable AND unbelievable. It was such a waste of my time to try and sit through this unproductive mess. Ironically this film is a classic reason to support and venture to see more independent films that are actually worth watching and paying for. Have you ever walked out of a movie theatre because the movie was so bad? Well be prepared to stop, rewind and move away from the tv. Please don't waste your time."
1,READ THE BOOK,"They completely changed the premise of the book to make a ""politically correct"" movie. The book made much more sense."
1,Aaahhhh!!!!!,"What a disappointment. After having viewed other Tom Clancy movies and comparing them to his novels, this movie is an insult to his work. Even more disappointing is that Tom Clancy had a hand in having his excellent novel of the same name brought to such a dismal screen production. It must have been the money because no self-respecting author would let his work be butchered so. In truth I would like to give this movie (sic!) a minus 5-star rating."
3,"A good movie, but...","This movie is really pretty good. I've given it a three star rating because that is what it deserves. It is a decent movie, no Oscar winner here, but did you really expect that?Ben Affleck portrays the recurring character of Jack Ryan pretty well, make no mistake, though, he's still Affleck. He's a little to pretty to imagine as a CIA official, but lets not dwell on that.The plot is good, and Morgan Freeman is excellent as Ryan's superior and friend.The movie has a lot of romantic and comic relief, so at least it's not 2 hours of intense scenes of Ben Affleck on a Nokia!Certain parts of the movie aren't extremely believable, but of course, after 9/11 it's hard to imagine that anyone could sneak a bomb anywhere, less a big football game with the President attending.This wasn't my favorite movie, but if you want to be excited and enjoy a movie for a few hours, this movie will do!"
1,"Hey, at least I caught up on sleep during this movie","This is the most boring movie of all time! If you want to catch up on sleep even in the afternoon, just put it on, and you'll be out cold for the whole time. This is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BBBBBBBBoring!!!!!!!!!!! Why would Morgan Freeman be in such trash?"
1,sum of all stars? zero!,"Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled ""reapeat"". On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough. Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor."
1,Disaster,"I'm a big Tom Clancy fan and the Sum is one of his best books. So it was a huge disappointment seeing this film. There were two drawbacks at the outset: Affleck (whom I like) playing Ryan, not Harrison Ford, and the modifications compared to the book.Apart from these (not important for those who don't know Clancy) the suspense and action of the book is totally missing from the movie. The story is very slow and predictable, the characters not convincing. All Clancy movies, even the rather bad Clear and Present Danger were much better."
1,Apparent bootleg copy,"I purchased this special collector's edition DVD from Amazon in what appeared to be legitimate packaging, but throughout the entire movie the following message appeared regularly, blocking a significant portion of the lower screen and remaining on the screen for at least a minute: ""This screening copy is the property of Paramount Pictures. All rights reserved."" I am owed a new, legitimate DVD!!"
2,duck,did not like it not enught action. dont watch it. wast of time.that all said and done.sorry that the way i feel.
2,Not the Definitive Daniel Johnston Handbook,"This book calls itself ""The Definitive Daniel Johnston Handbook"" - I have known Dan for over twenty years and I have to disagree. The pictures and the art work in the book are great but the definitive Daniel Johnston book has yet to be written."
5,oh' hell yes!,"1... 2... 3hreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...This is not a mind trip, this is about a journey!"
3,Close but no cigar!,"This is a well-acted thriller, full of excellent dialog that fails miserably in the closing stretch. As I watched the gradual escalation of the conflict, the eventual outcome seemed inevitable to me - one of the characters would end up dead and the other in handcuffs - and I was going to see how the lives of two flawed but not fundamentally evil people could be destroyed by bad luck and too much testosterone. Imagine my surprise when Hollywood steps in to provide redemption to the two main characters and punishment to the wicked elder lawyers! A Hollywood cop-out on the magnitude of Fatal Attraction, and all the more disappointing given how well everything had worked up to then."
2,Men behaving badly....,"Interesting premise, very flawed execution. Affleck's performance is so wooden it's best to just concentrate on the mole on his face to keep yourself from going dizzy.TOO! MUCH! DRAMATIC! ACTION! Within the course of ONE day? C'mon! It's very hard to believe so many wacky hijinks unfold within such a short time frame. ""Well, that's because it's a parable, a morality play."" Then why is it set in such a realistic place? Why is there such expository minutiae? ""Because it's about issues, MAN! Like, real life and stuff!"" Jeez, are you still in high school or something?Another completely phony, inexplicable critic's darling, just like American Beauty. (resignated sigh)"
1,"Very, very disappointing","I had read so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to rent it out as soon as available on DVD.I was extremely disappointed by a story that made no sense and a pathetic ""happy"" ending.What really puzzled me was the serie of unbelievable events from the first accident scene to the second accident, where Gavin (Ben Affleck) ends up a few yards from Doyle's (Samuel L. Jackson) car, and Gavin recognizing Doyle in the streets of New York on a rainy day with Doyle all bundled up, etc... etc...This movie is so unplausible that I felt insulted as if the director (Roger Michell) considers all his viewers as utterly stupid.This is a movie you do not want in your collection."
2,Can't we all just get along?,"Storyline: morally repugnant Wall Street lawyer gets into a contest of tit-for-tat with morally repugnant blue collar drunk. After repeatedly messing with each other they make up at the end and agree to be better men.Actors: Samuel L. Jackson carries the movie. Ben Affleck proves once again that ""Chasing Amy"" was a fluke and that he really is [...]. William H. Macy shines in his role as a morally-neutral enabler. Sydney Pollack as the high-powered New York law partner acts just like a Hollywood writer thinks a high-powered New York lawyer would act.Most interesting revelation: many conservatives believe that liberals take the positions they do on moral issues to salve their consciences, and not because of the issue's intrinsic moral worth. Changing Lanes confirms that hypothesis, turning death penalty appellate work into moral therapy. My, it must be so wonderful to be both rich *and* morally superior!"
1,Could two people be any more stupid?!!,"This is a ridiculous story about two idiots who refuse to do the right thing from the start. This kind of idiocy works in a comedy, but it clearly does not work here. There was nothing humorous about this movie, especially SLJ's little story about Tiger Woods. Every event is blown way out of proportion and escalated way beyond reason. Time after time I was shaking my head in disbelief, wondering why these two characters were doing what they were doing. After watching half of this movie I left to go do something more productive with my time."
1,Horrible,"This is a poorly written, directed and acted movie. I saw this in theatres and we wanted to walk out. It's truly laughable. This is what they call movies that big stars do just to make the studio some money. Trust me, pass on this movie, it truly is horrible."
4,"Beautiful, long lasting but it burns!","I have Stagecoach, the lighter purple one, and its gorgeous. It goes on as a thin layer and if you want a heavier application, just add more. I've used this as an eyeliner and all over the lid, I placed it on top of Grifter by Urban Decay, and it was beautiful. It also lasted all day as well. The price point is a bit high, you can easily find glitter liners of the same quality and size at the drugstore but Urban Decay's colors are quite unique which made this worth the purchase. My only warning is that it burns the lids, at first I thought it was me but i've heard of others having the same issue. At first it feels like a cooling sensation then a sudden intense burning, like fire, occurs for about 30 seconds. I have no idea why it does this, I've tried asking those at Urban Decay and they had no clue. But it also feels this same way with other glitter liners, so be aware."
5,Available for download in pdf,"I was able to search and find this book. Someone has taken the time to scan and upload onto the net. I was looking for this book for a couple of years, and kept coming back here to no avail. just too old and out of print. If I can get my hands on a hard copy, I would still love to have one, but in the mean time.santaanamountains dot org/Biota-Pequegnat dot pdf"
2,Wrong color,Not happy at all with color. Perhaps I chose the wrong color. I wanted a dark brown - this is not as dark as it appears on sample. Came out a reddish brown on some pieces and even lighter on others. Both were white to start but different material. Followed instructions carefully for top load washer & previously dyed different color on other items which came out fine.
4,"Only 5 Tracts, Not 4",This is a 2 CD set. One disc has 4 songs and a video? I think (I can't watch it my computer freezes). The other disc is a DVD with videos/phot gallery.
3,Not quite three stars ( from a MAJOR Philip Roth fan),"I have read eight other books by Roth, and would give them all four or five stars each. I kept each one, because I always keep books I loved.""ZB"" is the only Roth book I gave away after finishing. I just did not care for this trilogy and epilogue. If you have never read anything by Roth, do not start here -- you will get the wrong impression of this author. Read ""Portnoy's Complaint,"" and ""Goodbye Columbus"" if you've never read anything by Roth. If you've already read ""PC"" and ""GC,"" then I can also wholeheartedly recommend ""The Professor of Desire,"" ""Operation Shylock,"" ""The Facts"" (non-fiction), ""When She Was Good,"" ""The Counterlife,"" and ""Deception."""
1,too easy for junior-high kids,Not a serious work on programming. Worthless. I am sending my book back.
3,Tal Farlow Rocks,"An original vinyl recording was on Zanadu Records. The recordings were called ""Fuerst Set"" and ""Second Set"", recorded on a reel to reel in Ed Fuersts apartment in NYC. The recording quality was pretty shaky then, and these recordings do nothing to enhance the quality.The problem is that these recordings are some of the best work the trio format did. (Vinny Burke; Eddie Costa). It truly was inspired work."
1,disappointed,The discs looked great and the first one played great. The second one will not play at all. I was surprised to have a problem because they were so clean.
5,"Touching, Poignant, Beautiful, and Emotionally Gripping","It has been many years since I have seen this movie, yet to this day whenever I think of it, I cannot help but tear up. ""Lonesome Dove"" is not just the greatest television production of all time, but one of the best movies ever filmed. The characters are all extremely well drawn, the acting is nothing less than superb, and the script is absolutely brilliant. This magnificent picture stays true to the romantic vision of the American West while not shying away from the dark aspects of its history. Because of this, the story has the sprawling look of an epic saga, yet is on many levels an intimate story of friendship.I love practically everything about this movie, and only wish there were more like it. This film definitely ranks with ""The Searchers,"" ""My Darling Clementine,"" and ""The Unforgiven"" as one of the greatest and most intelligent westerns of all time."
1,Dry as the Desert!!,"Lonesom Dove dragged on and on and on and on.........> It's very dry, and even though Tommy Lee Jones and other well known stars appeared in it, it still was TERRIBLE. If you want to see a REAL western, watch Wyatt Earp (Lawrence Kasden) - NOW THERE'S A WESTERN!!"
5,Lonesome Dove New DVD,"Great Western! LOVE that I now own a mint condition copy!Purchase was exactly as described with fast delivery, not to mention very fair price !! Thanks,Your Patron"
5,Lonesome Dove Western Classic,A classic western. Great scenery and all the actors were great. A must have for any collector of classic westerns
3,Deficient Video Detail,"This is without question one of the greatest western sagas every made, which makes one wonder why more care was not brought to the DVD edition. I LOVE the story, and will watch this movie again and again. But I was sorely disappointed in the washed out, grainy look of the DVD. What happened? I give this three stars for the quality of the DVD, the story and actors receive the highest rating I could give."
1,review,Does not play in any dvd player I have found. I would like to discuss exchange or other options available.
3,Where are all the scenes?,"The reason I only gave this 3 stars is because there was alot of scenes edited out of this copy! I would rerind to rewatch thinking I missed the parts I was looking for but those scenes were not there! I first saw this on tv as a mini-series, and there were more scenes!! The story itself is fantastic but I will be investigating and exploring to look for a copy with no editing. Otherwise good movie, love all the actors, excellant story!!"
5,Awesome,Great classic series at an incredible price. Much cheaper than a retail store and a great asset to any DVD collection.
5,Very Good for an old TV mini-series,"I recently bought Centennial and Blue&Gray;, both pretty good, but the Blu-Ray version of Lonesome Dove was very surprising in that the video and audio quality were both excellent.If not for the somewhat-cheesy writing and acting of older movies (and excess fill lighting), you would think you were watching a new show. Overall, excellent."
4,Excellent movie!,"I've purchased that DVD after reading the great epic western book of Lary McMurtry. The book was much better, but i've enjoy the film as well.."
5,My 2,"Even if you're not a fan of westerns, DO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! It will become one of your favorites. Great story - fine, fine acting by all - super cinematogrophy and wonderful music. Larry McMurtry at his best! And the movie portrays the book nearly word for word (but is better because you'll feel like you're actually LIVING the story)."
5,The only way to shop.,"Amazon.com has become my preferred way to shop. My orders are always ontime, in good condition and the priced of anywhere. It is the only way to shop. My movie Lonesome Dove on Blueray was deliverd on time, priced right and in excellent condition."
5,Best western ever,I think this is the best western ever produced. The intertwining stories cover a broad spectrum of the west. Worth the money
5,"Christmas mood, Christmas Spirit","This is the greatest Christmas Mood Cd of all time. If you are not in the Spirit after listening to this One,then The Grinch has definitely stolen your Christmas. This is my second CD. I missed not being able to listen to Angel's Noel last Christmas, but not this Year. Noel and Merry Christmas!!!"
5,title,This book is the best I read it when i was thirteen and i still remember it now that i'm twenty.Buy it!
4,Let the Buyer Beware!,"I'm thoroughly confused. The songs on this album are mostly different from the songs on the Razamanaz album I'm familiar with. Yes, the first song is Razamanaz, but after that the songs listed here at Amazon are incorrect. The correct song listing is the following:1.Razamanaz2.When the Lights Come Down3.My White Bicycle4.Expect No Mercy5.Kentucky Fried Blues6.Free Wheeler7.Cats Eye Apple Pie8.The Ballad of Hollis Brown9.Love Hurts10.Ruby Tuesday11.Animals12.Juliet13.Dear John14.Morning Dew15.Love Leads to Madness16.This Flight TonightAll of the songs on this CD are good or better, but just know what you're getting. If you like Nazareth, and you're not looking for all the songs on Razamanaz, then you'll love this compilation."
2,If it ain't broke don't fix it!,"I owned a Mr Coffee TM1 model tea maker for several years and was pleased as punch for the most part. I was excited when I got a new one along with a new home, except the TM3 model pitchers in less than 7 months started leaking at the seams, and of course you need the pitcher to make the tea. The replacements are only around $8, but at 2 or 3 a year, that can get costly. I have contacted the company in hopes to get some type resolution. Happy New Year. Tina"
1,Orginal TM1 Better then the rest,"I too have replaced with the new Tea Makers from Mr. Coffee and I actually wound up buying two of them One, the Christmas 2004 and June of last year. The problem we had was it leaked, What I found is that making the tea hot going into the spout of the pitcher made the seams leak over time. We also had a replacement pitcher sent to us, so we had 5 pitchers and two tea makers, We are now down to only one pitcher and threw all the rest out, when this one starts to split and leak, then this will go to and over to Hamliton Beach we will go!If you don't have to old TM1 don't buy the new one!"
2,"Not the pitcher, it's the maker","We've had two and both died within 6 months in the following way:The brewer stops after only a quarter of the water is passed through, we have to push the ""power"" button over and over until we get the full pot. We tried all the different ""cleaners"" from basic vinegar and water solution to more professional but it doesn't seem that there is any deposits or build up (besides I have a Mr Coffee Coffee maker that has only once in the past 5 years seemed to have much calcium build up). The only conclusion is that there is some sort of timer or other that shorts out.However two of these in 1 year next to my coffee brewer never failing in 5 leaves me to believe the maker itself is the problem."
2,UGH! Leaky!,"I had a old Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker I received in 1999 which after 10 years, went out. I replaced with this ""new version"" and was so sadly disappointed. This darned thing leaks everywhere. I've tried even leaving the pitcher under the spigot for an hour. I then go to get the pitcher and the counter top has tea everywhere! It takes a large bath towel to clean up the mess.Mr. Coffee, why did you change from the old design which had a open and close toggle on the steeping basket??Mr. Coffee does have a new design out where the steeping basket is on the pitcher, not the unit, but I am hesitant to buy this version. I haven't been able to find it anywhere except through their website and a local grocery store. W-mart and T-get don't have it as of writing this review.I am donating this contraption to the charity and going to order the Hamilton Beach tea maker and see how that works."
1,It leaks!!!!,"One of the worst products I have ever owned. It leaks all the time, even when I work really hard to get everything lined up perfectly, I end up with more tea all over my counters and floor than in the pitcher. Mr. Coffee is known for great products, but I'm shocked that this one is still on the market. It Stinks!!!!!"
3,"Great tea maker, awful pitcher","I've had this model for about two years. In fact I've had three of them.The iced tea maker works great but the pitcher just doesn't hold water--literally. All three have cracked at the seam. I treat mine with great care and do not apply pressure as another reviewer stated. I don't even fill it with ice cubes. I make the tea and then pour it into another container for refrigeration. I actually witnessed one crack as it was filling with tea from the tea maker. I repaired the latest one at the seam with sealer but then it started randomly cracking in several places on the body of the pitcher. I wish they would make a better replacement pitcher. I find that I can usually find the whole unit on sale for about the same price as a replacement pitcher. Other than the pitcher, I love it but I may have to go with a Hamilton Beach next time because the pitcher is making it too expensive."
5,Ice Tea Maker,It is everything I expected it to be. It makes great tea and does most of the work itself.
5,Makes the best tea,"This is my second Mr. Coffee tea maker. My husband and I love it because the tea tastes so much better when it is brewed. I used to make iced tea by pouring boiling water over the tea bags and letting it sit for awhile. However, my tea always tasted flat and bitter. The Mr. Coffee tea maker brews tea just like a restaurant. You won't regret your purchase."
2,Find the Original,"As a southerner who drinks tea with every meal and often in-between, I love the convenience of having a machine that makes the process of brewing ice tea easy. When the machine first came out, my mother was one of the first to purchase one, and we used it on an almost daily basis. So, when I moved out on my own after college, the first purchase I made was this iced tea maker; however it wasn't the same as my mother's. The new one leaked while brewing, wasn't dishwasher safe, was a pain to clean, and overall a very cheap design. The lid is flimsy and warps very easily. That is why the moment that I went into a thrift store and found the original model, I purchased that one and threw out the new one.If only Mr. Coffee would return to making the original, dishwasher-safe model that was easy to use and to clean, then maybe I could give this a five star rating; but for this model and others like it, I can only give it a two."
5,Mr. Coffee Ice Tea Maker,"Needed to replace old ice tea maker, thrilled they still made them and the quality was great."
4,Top expanded and no longer fit pitcher,"I love this teamaker and use it regularly. However, all of a sudden the top wouldn't fit the pitcher. When I couldn't believe it no longer fit, I forced it and the pitcher cracked! So I guess the bottom line is the quality of the plastic being used is not dependable over the long haul. (I've only had this--my second one--about a year!) But I do love the convenience and the resulting tea when it works and will just end up buying another one. Somehow I feel that's a rip-off and that the item should not be built as if it were a disposable item."
1,not what I was expecting,I was so depressed when my old tea maker broke that my husband decided to buy me a new one for mother's day. He purchased the exact model and amazingly it is already broken; with the same problems my old one had which had cracked right down the pour spout. Ive tried contacting the company about the pitchers before but was told they were out of them and to contact them again in 6 weeks...whats the point when with shipping it will cost the same as a new one? you cant even find the pitchers in regular stores like Wal-Mart which sold my husband the tea maker in the 1st place. In any case I shall not buy a Mr.Coffee item ever again since the quality has dipped so far down.
1,Low-quality,After less than 2 years of use BOTH of my pitchers have cracked at the seam and now leak tea. I'm moving to a better brand.
5,Mr. Coffee Makes a Great Ice Tea Maker,"After tasting my ice tea, my neice insisted that I get her a Mr. Coffee Ice Tea Maker for her wedding shower. It makes really good tasting ice tea and Mr. Coffee seems to be the only one that makes the 3-quart size which is perfect for everyone to have a glass while you make another batch. I also bought the extra caraf just so I could get a second batch going for the fridge. FYI, I only buy Mr. Coffee coffee makers because they seem to have always lasted longer and are easier to use that other brands without breaking the bank."
4,Great Ice Tea Maker,"I owned two of the 2-quart predecessors to this unit and wore them both out; I drink a lot of ice tea.After buying one of these and breaking into the box I was not too sure about it. The pitcher did not look and feel as durable as the previous model I owned. However, the new design allows for better steeping of the tea and uses less tea for 3 quarts than the old model did for 2 quarts. When you drink as much tea as I do that's quite a savings.As for the durability, I have had no problems so far, but that is the only thing I have reduced the rating for. End result: I love it."
2,Spend the money on a sifter with a crank,"I bought this sifter because it was inexpensive and I had lost my crank sifter at my son's school. I thought I could use it until I found a better one. I shouldn't have bothered. My hand is small, but it seizes up after just few sifts. This sifter seems to jam as others have mentioned and somehow clumps of baking soda and sugar get stuck between the screens. I find myself whacking the side of the sifter to get the clumps broken up. My mother had a similar sifter she kept for many years. It eventually rusted and small rust particles went into the flour, etc."
1,"Terrible product, manufacturer no better","When I first got this water pot, the inner wall had a spot of rust in it. Returned it to the manufacturer (shipping at MY COST) and got a replacement that had rust appearing after the first boil! Obviously a very inferior product although it looks like better known brands.NOT RECOMMENDED unless you need more iron in your diet."
3,More fuel for the fire,"It was a quick read for me. In part because it wasn't a thick book in another part because it moved along quickly and was interesting. I would recommend this book to all those who are interested in the Oak Island mystery as it renders bits and pieces of previously unknown information(for me). Plus its only 7.95. It doesn't have all the important background information as other books on Oak Island and I believe the author expounds into areas he is not in a position to, hence I only gave it only 3 stars. If you are a skeptic of Oak Island, pass this one up go purchase a book that will add to your: if you can't smell it, or touch it, it doesn't exist, collection."
5,Works Great!,It works great for shallow bird baths. Had temps down in the teens and water remained unfrozen. It really is used by the birds.
2,Gary Hoyt,"I ordered this item was disatisfied with it, sent it back.From the engineering and design to the noise it made left allot to be desired.Purchased two G.E.'s that work efficiently and in my opinion are superior products at about 1/4 of the price."
4,To read out the sequels..........,"Kimberley White is a good author,(here comes the but...)in my opinion,she's still growing or needs to. The story of the ballantyne men are a sequel of books and they are finding their soulmates,each with their own read, in this one it's Kirkland ..I was disappointed that kirkland was still in the grips of losing a best friend,and Cassidy Parents didn't accept that she had a baby out of wedlock.It wasn't one of my ""forsake everything to finish.."" read. I just want to finish the sequels with the B-men. but I did give a four star, so I'll say it was enjoyed???."
5,It doesn't get much better than this.,"""At Close Range"" is one of the most amazing films ever. Sean Penn and Christopher Walken are both brilliant in this dark, disturbing tale, based on a true story.Beautifully shot, with incredible performances from all involved, makes this film one of my top 10 films of ALL time."
2,SUCKED WALKEN COULD HAVE DONE BETTER,"At the time Sean Penn was not very known so it didn't surprise mehe would be in this flop of a movie.But Walken was already respected and an oscar winner.What was he thinken.ChristopherWalken is a great actor and he does a good job in this but thismovie is so boring I couldn't wait for it to end.Skip this seeDeer Hunter,Dead Zone for good Walken movies.As for Penn alongwith colors thank god for Casualties of war or he would have never gotten were he is today."
5,Good Music,"I first heard this at a friend's house, and knew I had to have it. Lovely arrangements of some of my favorite classical music."
3,Proofreader?,"On page 272, recipe for New York Cheesecake, I think one needs more than 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs for the crust, probably 1 and 1/4 cups?On page 414, recipe for Perfect Cinnamon Rolls, after the rolls have been arranged on the buttered sheet pans, do not the rolls have to to rise again before baking?If I am wrong, I hope someone will explain.Thank you."
4,good intro to law book,"i recommend for people with basic law understanding that want to learn a bit more. book is not too in depth, but detailed enough where one can learn about US law. also good to read before starting law school to freshen up on our legal system."
3,Buy this book to discover how boring law is,"I'm not sure how to rate this book. Is it the author's fault that the material is dense and boring? Or is that the nature of law? Whatever the case, this book served its purpose: to help me decide whether I ought to explore the legal arena. And the emphatic answer - at least for now - is no. Buy this book to see whether law is right for you."
1,SHOULD BE LISTED AS CHRISTIAN FICTION,"Unfortunately, I made it barely a quarter of the way through what I hoped to be a good book. The religious references became increasingly more frequent the further I progressed in the book and got to the point of overwhelming any further enjoyment. I had to stop when I got to:""There is also no doubt in anyone's mind that there is a God and that the Bible is his word. Of course, we sometimes argue as to how to interpret that Word, and some people live very little of their life by the Word, but virtually no one doubts the veracity of the Word itself.""Everyone is entitled to their religious beliefs, or lack thereof, but this book just beats you over the head with it. Combine that with exceptionally sloppy editing (or, more likely, none at all), and this book barely warrants one star."
4,a new slant on time travel,"I have seen many movies and read dozens of books involving time travel but, frankly, none with a Christian world view behind the writing. I wasn't sure it could be done but the author totally pulls it off. It totally kept my interest and I am looking forward to reading the sequel. The characters were unexpected as heroes but believable."
4,Absolutely great!! All PRINE fans will love it! Love it!!!!,"Am a long time Prine fan. This album is great. Just love ""quit hollerin' at me!"" John has his own unique style of music and his songs tell a story.LOVE YA, JOHN"
1,WHO KNOWS?,"The book vendor sent the wrong book. when I informed them, they told me how sorry they were, but did not send the correct book. If they simply did not have the correct book, there were many other vendors that did - You would think that good practice would dictate that they get one sent to me. Buy NO! Their attitude was ""Go fly a kite sucker"". The Amazon order (direct) prior to this one was about a year ago when they ripped me off with an enormous freight and handling charge. I should have stopped dealing with Amazon after that,but unfortunately I gave them another chance. I will not make that mistake again.Good Bye."
4,Silly and Sappy,"Enjoyable, because I like the horses, the rest of the movie is very silly. The dirty truck is silly, Why do like this picture? The cast is good."
4,An Old Favorite,"A must-have for Chuck Norris fans. Masterful martial arts action, and the added bonus of seeing Kung Fu star David Carradine, too! Norris always shines as a Texas Ranger."
4,need for speed: prostreet,it is a good game graphics are good gameplay is good it is a little slow getting into the game but then it picks up and is good from there on out I am only about 20 percent though the game but over all I think this a good game
1,this game sucks,please don't buy this game. i played the demo and it sucked. there will be plenty of racing games soon enough
3,Excellent graphics and cars I grew up with but no vibration feedback,GRID is a much better game with an E rating so my kids can play too.
3,Too Much Hype Too Much Praise,"I rented this film and just finished watching it today, reading alot about the movie beforehand i did have high expectations, And although i am gonna give this movie another view(and no not only for Ludivine Sagnier although very hot) i must say i was dissapointed, not much of a thriller, and i can hardly believe this film is being called ""suspense""?!?!!? I cant say i hated it though... the reviews are very misleading. Iam gonna give it one more try but for now it is a well acted softcore (...) 3 stars....Iam gonna give it another view maybe it will change my mind"
3,Well done... but still dry,"Swiming Pool is a very engrossing movie. It is quite good technically. Everything is very tight, and its everything is shown diliberately and seems to have more significance after you've seen the whole thing.But as to the significance... it simply feels like it adds up to nothing. I agree that the trailer portrays this as more of a suspense thriller than a psychological study. Very interesting on the one hand, but also very hazy on a statement.I guess film buffs will enjoy it once or twice, and the general public won't even have the patience for it once (though they may stay for the nudity and sex scenes). Also loses points for the forced advertising, similar to the DVD of ""Lost in Translation."""
3,Swimming Pool (Unrated Version),"Swimming Pool the (Unrated Version) is a overall ok movie.The pacing was slow at times but worked other times to build the mood.Nicely shot and at thought provoking.Not a movie to see with the kids, due to the subject matter and situations.like i said an over all ok movie."
2,"Swimming Pool, A HO-HUM attempt at mystery and suspense.","This film was one of the top ""snoozers"" I've been duped into watching. The portrayal of characters was only so-so, Rampling is not very convincing in her role and the dregs that are brought about for partners in sex scenes do not match the characters. I learned little about film enjoyment, was not thrilled at the snail's pace of the story and found the overall story and film quite boring. To attempt to put this film on the level of a Hitchcock thriller would require some serious drinking beforehand. I recommend this one be missed unless one has ""nothing"" else to do and has not reached the peak of boredom."
2,Mostly a Waste of Time,"The movie starts off very slowly, gathers a bit of steam, and then takes a plot turn that is totally inconsistent with the personalities of the two main characters, uptight writer Sarah and free spirit Julie.I'd quote one of Sarah's lines as she ""assists"" Julie with a task that they undertake, but it would be too much of a spoiler... in any case, once that line was spoken, I lost all respect for the plot.Some of the scenery in the movie is pleasing to the eye. For that, I'll give the movie two stars, rather than the one star it would have otherwise deserved.In any case -- don't waste your time watching ""Swimming Pool."" You'll drown in the stupidity."
2,A boring waste of time,"This is dull, dull, dull. And don't believe claims of hot women and lots of sex and nudity. There's really very little. Then, there's the mind numbing pointless plot."
2,disappointing,"I agree with the other negative reviewers. I'm fond of suspense movies with plot twists, but this one moved to slow, was weak in dialogue and the ending was unsatisfying. Glad I only rented it as well."
3,"An Enjoyable, peaceful, unassuming short film","Swimming Pool has always been in the list of those movies I've heard about but never watched. I finally saw it last night and I must say I had a good time.Five reasons this movie is likeable,a) not too many charactersb) every relevant female character in the film strips (come on, Im a guy I like this)c) strange yet likeable direction, lets the actor's eye do the talkingd) I don't know French, I like how they unapologetically left out the subtitles for English fanse) I love swimming poolsRecommend me more films like this one."
2,Wake me when it's over...,"Swimming Pool is bloated self righteous tale of two underdeveloped characters poorly interacting with no story and some sex and murder thrown in to make men watch it. Incidentally, this movie bored me to tears. Wake me when it's over."
2,"How do you say ""Booorrring..."" in French?","Murder, nudity, sex, France: you'd think this would be an exciting recipe for a film. So why did I keep looking at my watch?If you want to see a sexy French film, or even just a good French film, go get Agnès Merlet's ""Artemesia""."
2,Wrongful Imprisonment,By the time the movie started I was already in a bad mood. Focus Films makes you sit through nearly seven minutes of trailers for their upcoming titles and they won't let you skip ahead or go to the menu. Thanks a lot.
5,Nicely done indeed,"This movie used the whole ""reality"" bending genre in a brillant way that left this viewer transfixed. There were sooo many avenues and possibilities at the end which made for lively discussions and interpretations. There were just so many levels to this film that were pure genius. Overall plot of older woman novelist who is a vacationing in the countryside of France and trying to rediscover her inner muse is layered with so many fascinating subplots that I cannot say enough good things about this film. It's about envying others, taking stock of your life, having the short end of the stick in a relationship, how ""youth"" is wasted on the young, selling yourself out, the wild abandonment of being young, and just how far you're willing to go to get something you want."
2,Wet T-Shirt Film,"This is a wet T-Shirt film, ie the only reason to see it is the female nudity. The plot is ridiculess, even laughable. Photography and editing is home movie quality. The female lead seems talented, and lovely. A rewrite into a story of a teen with a father complex would be workable.Note: Father Complex: a teen raised without her real father and trading sex for the hope of love from older men as father substitutes."
2,Frenchy,"Let's face it, the real reason a movie like this has become as popular in the US as it has is because of nudity and sex. This movie has lots of it and not much else. The plot is thin, weak, and unoriginal, (...)."
3,Very Disappointing...,"Since Amazon keeps generating this movie as one of my recommendations...I have to say that I did not like this film (so cut it out--ok Amazon?)Like most other people, I thought the first half of this movie had promise, tension, and more than a little seduction. But then it all devolves into crap.A crappy murder mystery, crappy teenage whining, crappy mid-life crisis and a supremely crappy ending.Crap, crap, crap.Focus Features should be (and has been) putting out better stuff than this. Better to spend your time with one of their truly visionary films. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is just one that springs to mind.This is crap."
1,PSC-55,This bag is well made but will not work if you have the new Canon 950 IS. The camera is much larger than the case. Amazon site suggests that it is also for this camera. Do not bother buying this asit will not work.I returned this item back to Amazon because of this reason.
4,"Excellent for SD700IS, just for it","If you want to take with you a extra SD or a extra battery inside this case, well this is not for you. The case is excellent for carry the camera, very well protected, but just for it, because there is no space with the camera in."
4,Nice one to protect your digital camera..,The sleek design is the best thing. Shopuld have this along with your digital camera..
1,Canon leather case for SD670 Camera,"Wanting a small case for my new camera (Canon SD870), I ordered the Canon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case. The quality of the case was excellent - seams and leather appeared top notch. However, I could barely push the camera into the case because it was such a tight fit and because I put the wrist loop onto the camera the top of the case did not close well. Also, the button on the case flap was extremely hard to close. Additionally, (my fault) I really needed a place to put an extra SD card and/or battery. Went to BestBuy and found a great case (nylon)that did all the above and only cost about $10."
3,Magnetic closure scratches camera,"Older Canon cases used velcro to secure the case. While noisy, velcro can't scratch the camera, and I already have 3 scratches on the face of my newer camera because of the magnetic closure on this case. But, like always, the case is well made and fits my camera perfetly. I just have to be midful to put the camera in with the screen facing away from the flap and magnet, and to be careful taking it out. This is still a good thing to own to protect a camera inside travel bags or storage."
5,SD850IS Deluxe Leather Camera Case,"This is an excellent Leather case, with a magnetic clasp, I guess my only negative comment is that it is a little pricey, but I guess you get what you play for."
4,Excellent Quality,"Nice case (even luxurious I'd say) very well made and fits the camera snugly, offering excellent protection. No metal snaps. Closes with a generous-sized piece of velcro, which should last for the life of the camera depending, of course, on how often you open and close it. Has a leather sewn-on belt loop, which I use to hold a spare battery, albeit precariously. If it had even a bit more room inside to hold that extra battery or SD card (the battery is very thin) it would be perfect for me."
5,Canon Deluxe Leather Compact Case,My SD700is camera fits perfectly in this case. The soft inside protects the camera from scatches and shock. It is small enough to fit into a pocket or glove compartment. The case has a professional appearance to it.
5,Excellent Case for SD700 Camera,"Glad I bought this case for my SD700 camera, it works perfectly with it. Its small and you can put it on your belt, which is how I use it. It is easy to get it out and shoot and put back away quickly. Top quality Leather, too."
2,Case too small for SD500,"Camera could be damaged by force required to insert into case and close clasp. Nicely constructed, however. Here are the extra words!"
5,"Wrong model for my particular camera, but still fits inside.","I recently bought a Canon PowerShot A495 as a ""sidearm"" camera, in case my Canon digital SLR should run completely low on battery. I was worried this wouldn't fit because their site suggested another case and amazon's search tuned this up. But my Powershot fits snugly inside and the case still clasps shut! I haven't taken it out that much but it seems to be a quality design."
4,Perfect fit for the SD850,Purchased this Camera Case from Beach Camera for my Canon SD850; shipping took about 3 days. The camera fit very nicely into the case. The case itself is very well made and looks elegant. The Canon metal logo is an added bonus. I recommend this case.
2,does not fit SD940IS,"I bought this based on some other reviews saying it fits the SD940IS. It doesn't. Well, to be precise, it could fit 3 SD940s at the same time. It is way too big for the SD940IS."
4,Fits SD1300 well...,"Just got this case for my new SD1300. Fits well, if a tiny bit large (better too big than too small!). It looks nice and is quality OEM protection. (note: no storage for extra battery or memory card)"
4,"Great case, but needs a side pocket","I bought one of these for my Canon SD-800 and can recommend it. For many years now, I've carried Canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the Canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose. My only criticism of the Canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media. I was hoping that with the tiny size of SD cards Canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases, but they haven't. On the plus side, the case retains the superior leather construction, uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of Velcro or a snap, and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body. The package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera. Incidentally, the SD-800 is well matched to the case, fitting quite securely."
3,A case without a pocket to carry an extra memory card.,"It is a nice case, but lacks the compartment to place an extra memory card which my old case had. I gave this new case to my son and kept my old case. The new case in my case was a waste of money."
4,Leather case - does the job,Fits the bill; looks tasteful enough for the camera. No features or design to comment about. A case that does the trick for an SD900.
3,elegant but not too functional,Looks great but I found a small Lowe case to be more functional - holds an extra memory card and is somewhat easier to insert and remove the cannon SD870
5,Canon PSC 55 Camera Case,"Fits the camera perfectly. Fits on my belt perfectly. A little tricky to fold the wrist strap across the top of the camera before closing the flap, but no big deal. Latch is a snap rather than magnetic or velcro."
4,great price and sturdy,this is a great price for a sturdy case however the only thing I would say is its damn bulky for ones pocket
3,Very tight fit for SD500,"This case fits my SD500 very, very snugly - too snugly in my opinion. I just received the case today so maybe it will stretch or loosen up with use but as is, I can't get my camera out of the case quickly. The description on Amazon includes the SD500 but on the package, this model is not included for use with this case. I had an earlier version of this case for my SD500 that I loved but unfortunately, I lost it. So far, I am disappointed with this case."
2,Not as good as it could be,"Very compact and fits camera nicely. I thought after all the great ratings it would be perfect for me. However, there is no place for a spare battery or a spare SD card. Also, it only has a belt loop holder and not a clip. I often don't wear a belt with my casual cloths and it ends up in my pocket instead."
4,beautiful,"When I had first heard the music from this cd I knew I would want more from the same makers. I have since purchased at least 5 others. Of course, that was about 9 years ago. However, they are still making music that tends to soothe the mind and body when you need it. I love it."
3,Required for class,"Lots of good ideas, research, and references. Text is broken up into mostly short sections with defined focuses for an easy read."
3,HDD RPM correction,"I have been doing quite a bit of research looking into adding some storage for my multimedia system and Iomega is far and away the most cost effective solution I have found. Especially when you consider that you can take your information to a buddy's house for gaming or working on files.The 40GB Drive listed here is NOT 7200 PRM, though. Iomega lists it at 5400. For a few bucks more you double the storage and add the bonus RPM. )Also, note that the USB 2.0 has a higher burst rate (480 MB/s) compared to the Firewire version (400 MB/s).gl hf (good luck, have fun)"
4,Still Enjoyable,I first saw this movie in Virginia and I loved it. I find now that it is still enjoyable. Feeling out of place is a common feeling and it is nice to see in a movie at least that things can be tied up nicely. It gives hope to the hopeless.
5,excellent boston-based heavy music...,"no one else has given a review of this kick ass band so I guess I will... Quintaine Americana is a very cool band in the local boston music scene... I guess if I could compare this album to anything, it would be big black, flipper, the melvins, or maybe the jesus lizard, although Quintaine have their own thing going on too... if you are a fan of any of the bands I mentioned, just click on some of the song samples and I'm pretty sure you'll want to buy this..."
5,GUITAR EXTRAORDINAIRE!,This is the one to get. Nothing quite like this out there. Sounds like 4 guitars. Very impressive!
5,A wonderfully presented regional 200 year culinary history.,"Our Texas Heritage: Ethnic Traditions And Recipes is a truly wonderful compendium and survey of the history of Texas food culture that is the result of the combined influences and culinary legacies of thirteen unique ethnic groups ranging from early Texas settlers down to the present day. From Grandma Techa's Menudo, Dark Irish Soda Bread, and German Potato Salad, to Ukrainian Pickled Mushrooms, Kneydlakh (Matzo Balls), Kransekage (Traditional Danish Wedding Cake), and Italian Baked Eggplant, Our Texas Heritage is an outstanding testament to the rich and diverse culinary spectrum that has fed and feasted Texas for more than two hundred years."
1,No more affective than saline solution .,"This product no better than regular saline solution . Would I purchase the product again ""NO""."
4,Customer Service is a Must!,This book has given us some ideas for activities to do during meetings and training for our directors and other staff. Quick and easy.
2,"Great in theory, not in practice...","I opened one up, unlocked the cap for the catnip to go in and before I could take the cap off the ball rolled back into the lady bug and the cap is now stuck inside. So, before I even got to try it on the cats, it's useless as far as the catnip goes. Definitely poorly designed in that way."
2,Did not last long..,I ordered mine approx 6 mo ago. The handle fell of recently. I must admit I left the basket outside at times on the clothesline. Would prob. be ok if left indoors.
1,Not the movie book!,"I ordered this book expecting it to be a book of the movie ""Snoopy Come Home"", or perhaps at least a collection of the comics inspiring the movie. Unfortunately, the copy I got, called ""Snoopy Come Home"", is just a random collection of Peanuts comics having *nothing* to do with the movie. Obviously, from other reviews, there must be a ""movie book"" out there, but ordering used there is no way to tell what you are actually ordering."
3,Print colors are off,"I agree with positive reviews, but the print colors in my copy were too reddish. Rocks or minerals that were supposed to be white looked reddish. Black slate didn't look black."
5,Rock Collecting 1,This book gives a detailed description and photos of so many rocks. We found it to be a great help in identifying the rocks that we have collected in Maine.
3,Accurate but quite problematic,"A fascinating work, quite complete with excellent photographs, nature, morphology, and basic geology skills, that is totally despoiled by the fact that it presents no way to identify the samples. Unlike other works which feature hardness scales and allow you to narrow down your search by the streak color, all that is featured in here is the chemical formula of the mineral. What are we to do? Taste the rocks!"
2,Upside down!,"I was so excited to get my book since we are studying rocks in my classroom. But...when I opened it, the first page was the index and it was upside down. The cover looks great but every single page inside is upside down and the end of the book is the beginning! Very disappointed! Books should be checked before shipped."
4,Rock Book,Bought for a niece who was interested in rocks and fossils and she was delighted with it.Product was what was expected and delivered timely.
5,The Real Man: George Harrison,"This documentary was informative, as it was a more personal look into George's life, but still left some mystic about him. I believe that he was an exceptional spiritual person whom had very complex personalities that also made him more human to the average person. He had a gift no doubt and touched many with it. He trained himself to prepare for the end and I am sure he is happier now then he ever was in this lifetime."
3,George probably wouldn't have liked this much,"I expected an excellent piece of work from Scorsese and found this rather average, at times disappointing.What is especially annoying is that all the songs are cut off brutally... My 11 year old daughter was wondering why they did not choose a 'fading-out' technique to ending songs prematurely and actually why not just play the song to the end???There sure has been a lot of cutting and jumping around from one interviewee to the next. It was great to hear Dhani read George's diary, but he could have been coached do to it more naturally. It felt a bit rushed. The ending with Olivia was weird, not the message, but her facial expression. All in all, this piece of work looks like a very rushed effort. What a pity!"
4,GEORGE AS ENIGMA,"The most eerie part of this comprehensive document was how little the death of John Lennon was dealt with in it. The segment that dealt with the most tragic aspect of the Beatles mythos was treated , well, dismissively, with Olivia quoting George as saying something to the effect of ""that was a bad way for John to have to leave his body""...what the hell does that even mean? This brings to mind the exclusion of John Lennon from George's autobiography (I, Me, Mine) and the fact that Lennon, in his last days makes note of it. I'm sure George was a good man, but he seems to come off as being somewhat aloof and removed from events and people going on around him, perhaps his ""spirituality"" caused this...or maybe that's just ""George being George""."
2,Who ok'd the audio engineering for this one?,"As stated by another reviewer here, I am amazed at what has passed as 'finished product' regarding the audio track of this blu-ray. Why should I have to hold the remote during the entire film, raising the volume (x2) to hear dialogue and lowering it again (suddenly) to not get blasted by musical sections? Amateurish, indeed. Nice film, but almost unwatchable because of this. It's actually worse than NPR's sound level issues."
5,Great George Harrison Documentary,I have seen a lot of documentaries of George Harrison but this one is the best yet. George is the one Beatle's that wasn't given proper credit. I think he was just as good as John and Paul.
3,Part 2 is good..Part 1 is rehash,"Part 1 of this film is the same Beatles rehash we've all seen and heard before. Part 2 picks up the pace. I personally would have preferred less of the 60's material (which is well documented) and more of the later years. First, George was a musician (gardener according to him). I found the lack of acknowledgement about his albums and music a bit concerning. Several of his albums are not even mentioned. I know time is limited on a documentary but this oversight was tough to overcome. Those complaints being said I did find Part 2 to be informative and learned a lot about the wonderful man."
5,Fantastic Film,"Watching this Blu-Ray was transcendant. The music, the history, the story, the people, the celebration of the wonderful life of George Harrison. A masterpiece!"
2,Not as titled,"I bought this in the expectation that it would cover the People of the ""New World"" as they existed before Columbus. Instead, it was basically a recap of the cruelty of the Europeans to the native populations viewed through the standards and sensibilities of today. I read 'Bury My Heary at Wounded Knee' and 'The Chronicle of the American Indian's Complaint' 30 odd years ago and being part Cherokee there was nothing new in the DVDs. Correction, there were many new things, most of which didn't happen. A good example is the DVD version of the conquering of the Aztec (Actually they were called Mexica but the DVD got that wrong as well). Read 'Conquest' by Hugh Thomas for the best book on the subject."
3,I didn't care for the flavor,"The packet of dried onions and other seasonings did not add well to the flavor. The seasoning is somewhat spicy so kids should watch how much of the seasoning packet they add. However, unless I added the entire packet, the flavor was too bland with the added water per the instructions.I would recommend the peanut sesame flavor instead."
2,Lost in the Maze,"Author Silverberg presents the reader with a puzzling conundrum for our rumination: an alien race build a 100 square mile maze around their only ""city""; loads it with lethal hazards and deadly illusions and leave no explanation as to the reason for it's existence or how it continues to maintain itself eons after the creators have perished.The author provides no answer, and I suppose none are necessary. The ambiguity hangs over the story and perhaps provides a mysterious ambiance.I was disappointed with this book. I was fascinated by the concept of the ancient maze and expected the story would resolve the mysteries of its origin. Instead we are presented with a fairly routine SF novel with unremarkable characters and a dollop of ""super-science nonsense"". The plot tells of a man isolated in the maze and how he is induced, by trickery, to leave and serve a greater good."
3,A good comprehensive book.,Overall a reasonable text to learn Distributed OS concepts. Its coverage of distributed algorithms is good. I would recommend reading the original papers for a better understanding though. The chapters are well organized and it is a good intruductory book for a grad student. Its coverage of distributed database concepts is rather superficial though.
5,Care Bear Movie Review,"This is a great movie that I watched as a child, I purchased the movie for my niece and nephew, and they loved it. If you have a young child that loves the care bears this is a great movie for them to get the full story on how the care bears came together.This is a must have for true care bear fans."
2,Care bears movie II: New Generation,There was a flaw on the DVD. It would get to a point and stop. It was a gift and 30 days would have passed before it could be returned.
3,some outdated papers,"The research described here spans topics like neurological factors and social and affective factors. The papers on the former are probably out of date, as these involve knowledge or more accurately speculation about how the brain processes bilingualism and second language. The vast increases in brain research since the book's publication make this fairly likely.However, the other sections of the book that discuss social aspects, or syntactic development are possibly still germane. Here the treatment is about higher levels of information processing."
4,no title,"I like the socks. THey are comfortable and warm. However, one sock came with a hole in it. Albeit a small one, I haven't worn that pair cause I haven't had time to mend it."
1,garbage,"too small, poor quality... the ears dont even fit, a complete waste of money.wish i had returned it, will never purchase a costume or clothing from amazon again."
3,"great idea, sounds decent, feels cheap","I really like the idea of a simple USB plugin based 5.1 surround sound headphone. This one almost makes it a reality and for the price, I guess it accomplishes the goal.But, I would have liked a better sound quality, the bass is good but the highs are somewhat lacking and that is what provides the direction of the sound.The plastic headphone itself is light weight and comfortable but it feels like if you drop them a couple of times they will fall apart.But for $50+ they work pretty good."
5,A Classic,This work is a classic in Catholic thought on mystical theology. St.Teresa's style is simple and down to earth; her ideas are profound and can be meditated on for much spiritual benefit. She covers prayer from the simple formal variety to the prayer of mystical union. Her ideas in this book are more of an outline. For more in depth treatment you might want to try her book The Interior Castle.
1,"Mr. Carrigan, Leave it Alone, Please.","Mr. Carrigan takes it upon himself to omit essential material in the books he edits--this and 'Ascent of Mount Carmel' are two. He ignores that these were written by religious for religious, and is presumptuous and arrogant to assume that the entirety of these saints' writings is not important. I purchased this book here, then after reading the preface, immediately auctioned it off and found an *accurate* copy.My suggestion: If you want to read the great Carmelite mystics, give Mr. Carrigan's versions wide berth."
4,HAS SOME PROBLEMS BUT STILL VERY GOOD,"PROS: 1. Records excellent video files in the attended mode. If you put it in PAUSE, you end up with a file which is processed fast in NeroVision 4 (if you are converting the MPEG file to a DVD disc). However the file size cannot exceed 4GB.2. In the unattended timer mode, the file has different characteristics and the NeroVision handles it OK but slow. But the file size can exceed 4GB.3. The cost price is reasonable.CONS: 1. There is a minimal time delay between audio and video, when you watch it concurrently in your computer display. But the recorded file is OK.However, when you put it in pause and resume, the time delay is not present in any significance!2. I like the quality of Nero Enhanced 7 a whole lot better than the Windows Media Center. But Nero cannot access this program in MCE. Luckily, I have a second computer with XP PRO and a linked ""server"" hard drive for sharing files."
1,Junk! Not waterproof.,This watch was rated to be water resistant to 50 meters. It got moisture inside the case the first time it rained. MIO wanted $50 plus shipping to fix my one month old watch that I only paid $35 for!Save your money for another brand that is really water resistant and has customer service that actually warranties the product. Cheap disposable crap like anything from MIO is a poor value.They even want $12 to ship my dead watch back. I hope they choke on it.
1,static shock,"I've enjoyed my MIO Wave but it often would not give me a heart rate while I was moving. Now a common static shock has ruined the watch. It is a problem that needs to be addressed. Difficult at best, since heart rate monitor measures small electrical impulses directly."
1,american folk songs for children,"it did not have enough patriotic songs that i was looking for. america the beautiful, star spangled banner, my country tis of thee, etc."
2,Sensual Woman,"This book was not what I expected and I was rather disappointed in it. I wanted a book exploring the ins and outs of being sensual...what I got was a history of sensuality in the human race. Book was well written and informative, just not what I was looking for."
3,Good with 2 Major Flaws!!!,"First let me say that this is a great P&S; camera, but.....1. There is a MAJOR problem with noise on these LUMIX cameras above ISO 200. On your screen they look great but they have a terrible noise reduction system that makes the pictures have a ""paint splatter"" effect. Who cares about I.S. lenses if the noise, not the blur, destroys the images.2. There is a serious lack of manual controls for a camera of this quality and price.I own this camera and DO like it but wish it didn't have these problems.It DOES take great video(which oddly has LESS noise than photos in low light).You can find articles about the noise issues online if you look.Thanks"
5,Fantastic Point and Shoot,"I bought this camera after reading a positive review by Cory Doctorow and I have to say it was a great camera. I say ""was"" because about two months after my purchase it was stepped on by a cow. That aside, I intend to buy this camera, or another in the same line again soon."
4,GCcheer02!!!,"Hello! I am a graduated cheerleader from Greenup County High School, and I can tell you that a lot of things in the book are true and some things are not true at all. Some of the things that he wrote about some of the girls was horrible. I know that some people don't like it that the cheerleaders get a lot of attention but if everyone would just go to one national competition in Orlando, FL they would understand what cheeing at Greenup is all about. Cheeing was the best days of my life, and I would give anything to go back and do it all over again, and I cheered on varsity from 9th-12th grade. But anyways to be a cheerleader at Greenup you have to be very very dedicated to cheering and only cheering, because that will be your life all through high school. But this is a good book, but just remember when you are reading it that a lot of the things are not true."
5,Excellent for REAL cheerleaders,"I think the author portrays what REAL cheerleaders go through...mess-ups, wrong dismounts, unstable bases. It really adds up and he portrays the pressures that cheerleaders are under going into competition or even just performing a new cheer at a game. I know because I am a cheerleader myself. Some things in the book may seem offensive to people but it is the complete truth of what goes on and how people actually feel when they step off the competition mat. They may be a part of a whole team but if they mess up, they feel like the bad link in the team and he really shows that you can only be as strong as your weakest player and cheerleading shows the utter truth in that statement; one of the most difficult SPORTS offered."
5,Excellent Book,"As a former Greenup County Cheerleader, I have to say that McElroy hits the nail on the head. Everything that is talked about is nothing but the truth and sometimes the truth hurts! Everyone just needs to get over it. People have been talking about our little town for years and no one cared enough to defend it then so why start now? He describes Greenup County so well that while reading the book you feel like you are driving down the road with him. Sure cheerleadin is hard and there is a lot of problems that come along with it, but it showed me disipline and if had I had to do it all over again I would! After reading the other reviews, I feel that most people from Greenup County don't approve of the book while everyone else around the US thinks that it is a really good book. Everyone from this county hates to admit it, but Greenup County Cheerleaders are the Pride of the Nation. WE PUT GREENUP COUNTY ON THE MAP!!!"
5,THE TRUTH,"I READ THIS BOOK AND ITS THE TRUTH. NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT THE GIRLS, BUT THATS THE WAY HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADING REALLY IS, THATS ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE NOT TO DO IT WHEN I REACHED THAT LEVEL. WHEN YOUNGER GIRLS READ THE BOOK MAYBE THEY WILL SEE WHAT ITS LIKE AND DECIDE NOT TO MAKE IT THEIR WHOLE LIVE LIKE MANY GIRLS HAVE."
5,always precious,Both my 2 yr old and my 4 yr old love Clifford. He is so lovable! Once again this is a good book to go over with your child to help ABC recognition. Clifford is a good tool for learning both on TV and in books! Your children cannot help but LOVE HIM!
2,cliffords abc,i bought this book for my granddaughter based on the rating.it is a used book and looks it .please be considator when rating this book. it should have beed a 80% rating mary
5,Cliffords ABCs,My grandson enjoys pointing to the leters and having you name then.As I have said before he is a special needs child He will also point to the letters when you ask him to identiy them
1,Horrible,"Most of this movie is people sitting in silence starring at each other. The amount of dialogue wouldn't be enough to fill one page, and is drowned out by the worst synthesized 80's-sounding music I've ever heard. The terrible music, brutal killings, and 1 SINGLE CAR CHASE are the only things that kept me awake through this garbage. To top it off, the whole thing leaves you feeling depressed and sad. Yuck! Just, yuck!! I want my money back!"
1,bad,"worst movie ever,worst movie ever,worst movie ever,worst movie ever,worst movie ever,worst movie ever,worst movie ever,worst movie ever,worst movie ever. bad , very bad . really bad .... worst than the worst movie you ever so . waist of time, waiste of money, its a waste"
1,this does not come with a true digital copy,"For all of you people thinking about buying this for the digital copy and haven't heard, they are using a new system called ultraviolet. You don't actually get a copy of anything, you have to sign up for 2 different programs(ultraviolet and flixster), it IS NOT compatible with itunes, and it will only work on your device if it has an internet connection. If you want to put this on your ipod it won't work. If you're travelling in the air it won't work. If you don't have an internet connection it won't work. Again if the digital copy is your main selling point do not buy this dvd, and boycott anything with Ultraviolet ""digital copies"""
1,How do you call a movie 'Drive' with three 1 minute driving scenes?,"This video is advertised as 'driving' but only 3 scenes of a few minutes driving scenes.. this movie is horrible! the only good part was the first 10 minutes of the movie. This movie isn't with 5,10 or 20 dollars. It should be priced at 1$ for blu-ray."
4,Gritty!,"OK. After reading some poor reviews, let me say that true movie buffs will find this film refreshing from a directorial view. Gosling's character is eerily captivating. The plot was solid and smart. One thing that detracted from the movie was the 80's style music (about a third of the film). Oh...and one last comment - some scenes may be too graphic for some viewers."
3,Was this a B rated 80's movie remake?,"I thought the acting was good at some points, you could tell there was always this emotional tension between the two main characters. I thought for some reason the movie would have more ""driving."" The music, title sequence and timeline felt like a bit of a cheesy 80's movie. I was hoping for more action, suspense and better music. sometimes I felt a little lost as what was going on, didn't seem to make a lot of sense. The killing scenes were also pretty gorey but in, again, a cheesy way."
1,Drive by!,"Gosling is a good actor, but this movie is not well put together and dragged on. It was a dissapointment for the entire family. Just a poorly written script with some secondary acting that was even worse. I say don;t waste your time watching this, as Gosling has done many other better projects. This is a Drive by!"
1,This is definitely not an action flick,"I watched Drive with very few pre-conceived ideas, except for the title and a 30-second trailer showing some car chases and a fight scene. Whoever marketed this terrible movie as an action film certainly missed the mark. I fell asleep not once but twice trying to finish this movie. This should have been marketed as a romance. Awful movie."
1,One of the Worst,"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Almost as bad as The American. Goslings character was incredibly strange. I dont think that Gosling acted poory, I think his character was just terrible. He didnt talk. And what was with the explicit violence? Putting his foot through someones head? Slicing the dudes arm lengthwise? It brought no value to the movie at all. And the romance? He barely said a word to her, was super creepy, and next thing yoiu know they are picknicking, eating cracked crab and Gosling is carrying the kid off to bed! lol"
1,Bleck,I really don't understand the hype behind this movie. Ryan Gosling basically looks like a ken doll and barely acts during the film. The plot is not particularly interesting and the ending is ridiculously unrealistic.Boo.
1,Possibly the worst movie ever....,Slow moving.....Over the top violence.....horrible dialogue....what I feel is wrong with the world today....very sad it is considered entertainment.....absolutely disgusting...
1,awfull,"the previews seem to almost be out of context it makes the movie look exciting and action/drama packed, this couldn't be further from the truth.... looks like it was directed by some film student full of long pointless seens with ""dramatic"" not... pause shots with light and abstract effects. If you like horrible pointless french films with-out the subtitles then this is for you otherwise DRIVE clear of this waist of bandwidth"
1,Perfect Depiction For Our Titillating Shallow Society,"An ugly pointless, zombie acted, boring movie filled with ultra violence and long gaps of literal silence.I would remind readers that as time goes on, more reviews are being seeded by those who stand to benefit.Always read the critical one and two star reviews first, then decide if what they say is important to you.Ironically I saw this movie while my tire was being repaired and walked out toward the end, as there was nothing good, just cheap violence. Low life, untalented script writers are just so uninteresting and repulsive."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Wooden acting, horrible score, boring action sequences, non existent character development. I don't understand why this movie has gotten such good reviews. The actual film making, pacing and editing for this movie make it one of the worst I have seen all year."
1,BORING,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. THE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE. THE SOUNDTRACK WAS THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE MOVIE AND THE PLOT WAS TERRIBLE. THEY TRIED AND FAILED.
2,Diapointing!,"Well, um, the story itself was decent. Gosling and Mulligan can act, but were'nt allowed to Because the film must have had an extreamely low budget!! The movie sometimes awkward, very long and drawn out. Very boring. With a better Director and better budget (god i hope they didnt spend alot on it!!!) and some tweeks with the writeing it could have been alot better of a movie.The sound track Sucked, sounded like 70's music really Lousey. The driveing scenes were decent. I was just very disapointed after seeing the trailer then the movie. I really would not recomend this movie to anyone, it was very dissapointing!!"
2,Easily one of the worst movies ever,This is easily one of the worst and most disgusting movies that I have ever seen in my life. The story is boring and the violence over-the-top. If you're thinking about watching this one I recommend that you skip it.
4,"Movie is worth 5 stars, UltraViolet is poor substitute for Digital Copy","Other reviews here have highlighted the movie's great qualities. The movie gets 5 stars from me.It loses one star when it comes to retail and the customer experience: UltraViolet is a poorly implemented system that has caused Warner Bros. to hand out iTunes codes to dissatisfied UltraViolet customers.[...]I won't buy the Blu-Ray copy of this movie due to the poor digital version option.HOLLYWOOD: For now, your most appealing movie package is the Blu-Ray + DVD + DIGITAL copy one. I pay the Blu-Ray premium for these!Otherwise, the savvy public is tempted to burn backup copies of their purchased DVD copies so they can watch them as they please.'nuff said."
4,A Cool Crime Drama,"Drive is a very cool crime drama (not an action movie) with an old-school 1970s or -80s sense of style and timing. It has a slow fuse, letting you hang out with the characters for a while, and then explodes into a rampage of ultraviolence. Good stuff."
3,Dude is crazy,"*spoilers* You kill that many people, and in the end, when you have nothing left to lose, you leave the money, probably for someone else to come and take for themselves? I can understand (maybe) helping out the husband out of love for the girl. I can (maybe) understand taking half the pay at work that you know you deserved. But, I'm just lost. The guy seems sane and even compassionate toward the right people. I understand that. But, as far as the money, did he not take it because he'd feel guilty with the girl not having it? If so, why not get it to her somehow? And, why did she slap him for basically trying to save her husbands life and her son's and her own? Her husband probably would have died without his help, anyway, in addition to them being hurt.Sorry, I don't understand this. 3 stars for the action and suspense. Story doesn't make sense to me. Guy seemed a bit Terminator to me, but with some human traits. Strange."
5,Best movie of 2011,One of the most original movies I have ever seen. Much more depth than you would expect from the trailer.
2,Not what I was expecting.,The main reason for the low score was the dialogue and that it was extremely slow in the beginning. It did end pretty well and the pace picked up well in the end but the first half was so incredibly slow that I couldn't give this a good review even with the improvement towards the end. I wouldn't really recommend this movie to others although I do know a couple people who enjoyed it so it could be that it just wasn't for me.
1,Sucks,First ten minutes (at least) are long looks and awkward periods of silence. It's liek they couldn't be bothered to write any dialogue. the preview makes it look like an action flick but it's not. The end is a bit better but I was happy when the movie finally ended.My friends wanted me to rate the movie a two because Ryan G was in it... :
1,SO BORING,"Super boring movie, kept waiting for something to happen, waited, waited,waited..,then it ended!Got a total of 5 minutes scripts for the whole movie.Do not waste your time even it's free"
4,Well Done,This movie has all of the hallmarks of a movie I like*dark*good plot*action*a little blood*some cool and shady characters.The acting was well done.
1,One of the worst movies of my life.,The silence and awkwardness of every scene is enough to throw ur television out ur window or fall into a very deep sleep. I understand the overall point of the movie (he's crazy and unwell) and the last 30 min are good but it does not overcome how bad the 1st hour was... it was Holy$&!# AWFUL!!
2,Drive,"Interesting driving scenes, but slow for what I thought was an action movie. I imagine the preview had all the action scene, so don't expect much action. There are is probably 30 minutes of the main character just starting off into space, which is a complete waste of my time. This must be one of the ""artistic"" movies."
2,WHERE'S THE ACTION?,Way too slow for an action film. I watched it for about a half hour and this felt more like a character piece from the 70s when it was okay to have a very slow opening. I like Gosling in most films but not this one. WHEN WATCHED: early February 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C minus.
1,Drive,Drive sucked. Waste of my money. Worst film i have ever watched. I could barely stand watching it. So boring.
2,drive,very dull movie. took for ever for it to get going few action scenes here and there . bad quality sound for being a blu-ray.
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"Here is the deal, maybe I just didn't get it or it was really a bad movie. I LOVE Ryan Gosling and normally he can do no wrong. One person described his character well, little to say and no personality. SPOILER ALERT: He has no name in the movie, I kid you not. It is very slow, violent, dark and somewhat depressing. The love interest part of the movie has no spark and doesn't leave you feeling that there is a point to it. There are some good car chase scenes but that is about all I can say that was good. After the movie ended I was left wondering why I had wasted two hours of my life. This movie is not for everyone; if you like it dark, like it violent and like being left with an uneasy feeling at the end, then this is for you!"
3,Unexpected,"This movie was actually nothing like I had imagined. I feel as though the director and producer attempted to model this movie after Taxi and Transporter, with a slight twist of Pulp Fiction. The story line was weak, and the events played out incredibly slow. Indeed the film looks good in Blu-ray, but I am disappointed that I paid for the ""privilege"" of viewing."
5,Awesome movie.,"I love this movie. I hope it eventually has a special edition. For the people complaing that it has a cheesy 80s soyndtrack: the music isn't actually from the 80s for the most part and the movie is supposed to have an 80s feel. Opening credit text encaptures that. Great movie, much better than movies that have been coming out recently."
3,Nothing New...,"I've seen a lot of crime movies, and this one didn't offer anything that hadn't been done before. You don't really understand the characters or why they do what they do....but worst of all, you don't really care. It was gratuitously gory, which is a given in this type of movie, but for some reason the gory scenes didn't wrench you like they do in some movies (even some where you don't see the actual gore -- just the terse situation is enough to make you flinch knowing what is happening). The romance didn't have any umph behind it and the one scene that was supposed to be heartbreaking was just kind of ""blah."" Not a bad movie, not a good movie. Decent.I didn't understand why this had so much hype -- It was kind of like watching a summer blockbuster with an ""indie"" soundtrack thrown in."
3,"I see where they were going with this,","Quiet working man gets pulled into a really big problem. I had problems with the character not really speaking for a while. I can see trying to get the point across that he is quiet and keeps to himself, but really? Anyway the movie moved along pretty well, there is alot of violence so prepare yourself. I think we were expecting more of a car chase kind of movie with an over the top main character. It was a lot of driving and chasing but the movie was just different from any other action movie. I guess you could say action movie with in depth study of the human character."
3,"Mostly silent, boring.","Thought perhaps a ""take"" on the ""The Transporter"" but more like ""No Country for Old Men"", sort of. Took forever for plot to be set: slow and main character not very talkative or not talkative at all. Action movie? Mostly ""no"". Drama? Some, no. Bloody? At times extremely so. F..k word? Used a lot at times. Liked it? Yes and no. Recommend? No."
1,I wish I had 2 hrs of my life back.,"I rarely find the time to actually write reviews, but Drive contained such poor character development, needless violence, lack of plot and lack of actual driving that, in the interest of sparing hours from other people's lives, I hope that someone can derive value from this review and avoid watching this film. This was perhaps the most poor film I have ever seen, as agreed upon by the three other people watching it with me."
1,Movie is supposed to be about a driver not slow-mo acting,"Movie was okay, but it was not action packed or really good acting. It was just okay. I wish I had waited till it was free instead of wasting my $$ on it."
2,drive,"The movie was incredibly slow. It was advertised as an action film and turned out to be a snooze film. I usually buy dvds and this one was sold out at the store I frequent... thank god. Bad acting, no dialogue, limited plot."
2,Lame,"First 15 minutes were promising, the rest of the movie is simply absent. Oh, an ill defined mafia, yawn..Oh, and he leaves the money, he must be a real human being, oh he gets the boring, soul-less girl, fascinating."
4,a good introduction to needlepunch technology,There is a few book for textile technology. It is a good textbook and a reference book for the needlepunching technology.
4,Great for beginning chem students as it is large enough to read.,"This placemat is the perfect balance between a regulation sheet periodic table and a poster size.It is 17.5 inches by 12 inches and coated in really heavy plastic. Has Atomic number, symbol, name, atomic weight, valence shell configuration (and big enough to actually read), boiling, melting point, density, crystal structure and is color coded. It does stop at 112 and we are up to (in theory 118) but that is not going to be addressed in most beginning chem classes.Also 110, 111 and 112 do have names now Darmstadtium, Roentgenium and Copernicium respectively. So a new update would be nice (hence one star off, as it was published in 2000) , but again, for beginning students this will not be an issue."
4,"Study your chemistry, periodically!","This is an updated Periodic Table from the last one I bought (2002).This one is dated 2010 and has some the newer elements named properly.So don't go by the picture - it is of the copyright 2000 version.The colors seem brighter too - of course mine is aged.I have mine on the coffee table - great conversation starter!next to it I have the Star Chart version of placemat.They compliment one another - the very small next to the very large scale.Great if you are going on ""Jeopardy!"" or studying for Chem 201.(It keeps the beer glass from spoiling the table - giant coaster!)"
4,An inward-leading story appreciated only at the end.,"It is at this point in time that I wish to revoke my former statement about this novel by Robertson Davies. Although at the time unfinished and unliked, this work was something wholly amazing once read. The story twists back through itself and allows for sequels to either be read in sequence or on their own as separate entities. I reccomend reading the second in the series: ""The Manticore"". -Enjoy"
3,Early History of Martial Arts,"Originaly written as a series of magazine articles in the fifties, the book is not entirly accurate. It is a good overview of several Martial arts traditions. he covers all styles of martial arts. Covers everything from Aikido to Zen. Gluck does a very good job of conveying the passion for martial arts that he has. This book is a good read, and would be great for those thinking of starting the Martial Arts."
4,This is the book that started my martial arts study,"Originaly written as a series of magazine articles in the fifties, the book is not entirly accurate. It is a good overview of several Martial arts traditions however, and does a good job of conveying the passion for martial arts that the author obvoiusly feels. This is the book that originaly inspired me to start my study of martial arts almost twenty years ago,I have learned much since than. This book is a bit over-zealous on some points, but it is a good reference work for most martial artists, and a good read for the laymen."
4,Great Buy!,Mandingo was a great movie that teaches you about how things were in the slavery times. It was a good story with great acting! This is the first purchase I've made from Amazon.com and it definitely won't be the last!
1,"One of the worst films ever made, but a real hoot!","It is an offensive, incredibly badly made film with horrible acting and an inane script, but the final product becomes a sort of ""Springtime for Hitler."" One becomes fascinated at how bad it is. Great for midnight viewing."
4,Great insight!,The movie gave great insight on slavery....the things that you don't learn in a class room. Would recommend to others.
4,Tough Movie,"Not your normal ""Chic Flic"" but it could be...one that takes a look at what might have been back in the bad ole days of the south. The acting and sets were great. The story was complicated but shallow in it's dealing with a possible event. The director went out of his way to ""shock"" us but in the end only came up with a bad ending. It should make for an interesting remake if someone has the guts to do it right this time..."
1,Didn't work,I hate because the dvd did not work. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it if I could have seen it. I never thought about it not working because I usually have good luck with anything I buy from Amazon so I threw my papers away when I first opened it. Then later when I went to watch it - it didn't work.
3,In Agreement with Ms. Young,"I find it very funny that the viewer from Sidney, Australia knows so much about the history of America and slavery. Pick up a book or two, dear! Better yet, take an African-American History course (if one is available in Australia) at your local college or university. The cruelty depicted in this film are very true and real, and then some! This is definitely not the cleaned-up, unreal version of 'Gone With The Wind'. If anyone else believed that none of the atrocities (or the extent of them) happened, I feel extremely sorry for you and your limited knowledge of African and African American history."
1,Hideous! Atrocious!,"I cannot BELIEVE the praise Mandingo receives!I rarely quit a book, but did so quickly with this one. My opinion: it's a recipe for those who even remotely think other humans should be mistreated/tortured. Some may say I didn't give it a chance. Why should I?"
2,poor quality,the vest was made of really cheap quality material. there were dark outlines around the pockets on the front of the vest. The only thing I liked was that it was light weight and the tie was nice
5,Great Country Music From An Underrated Talent!,"I've been a fan of John Schneider's since I was nine years old, and his pure country voice is the most underrated in the whole music industry! ""Too Good To Stop Now"" is a great listen from first song to last, and the range of John's voice is enough to rival any other country star on the market today! From the fast paced ""What'll You Do About Me"" to the poingant ""Time Of My Life,"" this is the album that let John truly prove himself as someone who wasn't going to let anyone dismiss him as bubblegum. This is one of John's best, and I bet once you hear him sing, you'll agree that he's one of country's unsung talents!"
3,CD player is great but headphones are TOXIC!,"The headphones for this CD player are so cute. Each earphone has a little picture of Hello Kitty with a little pink flower on the side, but there is a Proposition 65 warning on the cord which says""THE COATED ELECTRICAL WIRE OF THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A SUBSTANCE KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE A CARCINOGEN OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANT. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING.""So if you or the person you're buying it for plan to eat snacks while using these headphones, this is NOT going to be safe. If I had known about this warning before, I would not have bought this product. I did a lead test on the wire and it has an extremely high level of lead, so I don't use the headphones at all. I keep the CD player on my daughter's dresser and use portable speakers instead. I would give the CD player alone 5 stars because all of the features work well, the sound is good and it's really cute, but the headphones get 0 for being unsafe and, therefore, completely useless."
3,"Great reference, full of errors","This book is an excellent reference book for options traders, novice and experts. It describes in great detail most of the strategies for trading options. I like the structure and the organization of the book. It helps easily locate a stragety based on several criteria, like your trading expertice or your perception of where the underlying stock is going.I'm dissapointed at the amount of errors in the book. I've only read 2 chapters so far and have found, not only mispelled words, but errors related to the description of the strategy, risk and reward calculations and inverted names (call instead of put, for example).If not for the errors, I would have given 5 stars to the book."
4,It's good start if you want to be in this biz,"Guy Cohen provided a simple understand about the flag trader, and this book furnished a good understanding how each strategy worked. It really doesn't apply if you are not on the market every seconds of the day. Good luck!"
2,Poor quality,"Being an almost 30 years old material, it won't be excellent, of course.But the transfer seems to be poorly made and the image doesn't stay stable. There is a troubling line in the down side of the screen during the whole show. Sound is under average, too. Don't expect any special features, neither an information page about the concert. I think it's a sad souvenir for a great band. Definitely, doesn't worth the price.By the way, I have tickets to see them live on August 18th near Boston. I'm pretty sure they are not proud of this DVD.Pedro"
4,Kitesurfer,"This is a handy little device I can keep in the pocket of my boardshorts. Since I am not too familiar with approximate windspeeds by ""feel"" (no previous sailing or other experience), this is/was a good way for me to build memory and put a ""number"" to the strength of the breeze. This helps to pick the right size kite for the conditions. The wheel/propeller gets stuck after the salt water drys, but is easily remedied by rewetting it. I recommend it to those with no experience with wind, or those having to choose the right kite size, and want a pocket device."
5,AMAZING LITTLE TOOL!,"I use this to take measurement when I got kiteboarding, sailing, parasailing, and even when I go rock climbing, this thing is accurate quick and I love the temperature piece, lets me have a better idea of what gear I need when I get out of my car. Skywatch is the most important piece for any kiteboarder its efficient."
4,great guide,"I'm glad I got this book. The pictures alone can give you a great start to understanding pattern fitting. Photographs of real people of different sizes are shown with the pattern tissues on them. The corrections and explanations are then given to help you see and understand what is being done. It has information for many different body scenarios, especially for those of us who aren't built like runway models. It did seem to jump around a little. You may have to go to another section of the book to check on full explanations. I noticed that was just how the book was designed, and I was able to know where to look after awhile. Additional information on fitting is also included, which is always nice to have."
1,You can do better at local store,"Relative to the price, the shipping costs turned out to be very high and delivery was poor. I had already auditioned and returned the speakers by the time the wire arrived. You can do better buying either speaker wire or lamp wire at your local discount, home improvement, or hardware store. Also, you should buy heavier gauge (lower number, e.g., 16 or 14 gauge) wire."
3,Review of Beeper's Friends,"Beeper's Friends is a text written for a first-time reader. The book entails a series of short stories; and there is actually more text advising parents how to read the book with their child than in the stories themselves. The stories are repetitive, as when Beeper and one of his friends endeavor to play a xylophone. Illustrations are in cartoon form.The book is intended for a child reading for the very first time, likely a child age 3 or age 4, and it fulfills its purpose of being an introduction to the act of reading."
5,The mnatouuuuhjuuuuu,Greatest B movie one of my top 3 of B type movies. Would recommend as a adult comedy on a Late Saturday night.
2,Died young,"Great concept; worked a few times before the USB connection at the back of the drive enclosure itself died. The included instructions are below average, and their website is useless. This sleek piece of aluminum is off to the recycling bin!"
2,"Some driver probs, and didn't fit my monitor -trying to return","Purchased for work devices and it is not ""universal"" as it doesn't have the connection for my (new) monitor. Trying to return it and the seller doesn't provide free shipping, so I've paid twice S&H on a device that doesn't fit my needs. And this was after a good 1-2 hours of trying to get the driver disk to load on my system, which has encountered no problems with previous driver loading. It's a great price, but make sure your system has all necessary connections or be prepared to buy the extra $40 cable, which by then, you could just buy one device that actually is universal."
5,Words perfectly,I bought 8 of these for a project - every one works out of the box exactly as it should.No complaints.
1,poor quality mechanism,"I bought this item several months ago and it failed in the first month, I replaced it from a local kitcheware outlet and this also failed in about a month. The idea of this product is very good but the quality of the product is very poor"
2,Stopped Working in less than 6 Months of Use,Simply stopped functioning in less than six months of light use. It was good when it worked.
1,Not very easy to use and didn't last long,"I bought this a while back hoping it would work for my elderly mom who has lost strength in her hands. She gave it a try, but it is not easy to connect to the can, so I took it back in hopes I could get some use out of it. It wasn't long before the mechanism broke, so it went in the trash. Very disappointed for the money I spent on it. I'm going to try the Amco Swingaway EasyCrank next for both of us."
1,Cheap plastic mechanism,"This seemed to work OK for the first three cans. Unfortunately the internal mechanism is cheap plastic and thin metal which failed after just a few uses. Now it clicks like a New Year's noise maker and refuses to rotate around the edge of the can.Nice idea, cheap Chinese implementation. As said before, you're better off with an old fashioned 100% metal jobbie."
3,Kinda Harley Quinn,"Like other reviewers the red diamonds are miscolored, the mask too tight, and the collar is silly. I used a snap to fix my collar after the elastic broke anyway. I didn't bother with the mask because I painted one on my face. My gloves were the not the correct color, they matched my sleeves even though they should be the opposite color of them. I also felt the outfit was form fitting like it should be, but too tight around my neck when sitting down. It doesn't define the bosom as well as Harley's real true outfit. The head piece was uncomfortable around my chin and my neck, the seaming also started to pull apart at the chin.Overall the outfit was alright looking but the stitching in some places wasn't so great."
2,Very Short in the Torso,"I am 5'4, size 6-8 and the medium was way too short. The jumpsuit fit around my body, but was digging in between my legs, making it very uncomfortable."
1,Would not buy,This is a very flimsy hat it looks like heavy plastic but it is not. Really is not worth the price.
1,Kingdom Hearts,"the reasons for my low review score on this product are;-firstly, its condition was poor and not as advertised. the cover was bent and the spine was frayed.-secondly, the content that was advertised was not delivered. the book i received had the sticker activity journal ripped out, and this activity journal was one of the books main selling points for me.-lastly, the product arrived later than was expected"
4,A Great Accompanyment For Your School Reading,"The Lake Of Souls, by Darren Shan, is 10 of 12 in the series. Darren Shan, and his friend Harkat Mulds, a Little Person, who was brought back to life by the mysterious but powerful Mr. Desmond Tiny when Harkat's soul was trapped on Earth, must venture into a realm where The Lake of Souls exist, and within it, Harkat must find his about himself because he has no idea who he was/will be. I, for one, think it's a good book to come right near the end, because I think Harkat will be a very important character to defeating the Vampaneze Lord, who is the enemy of the Vampires. This is book offers good surprises, action, and a little shot of horror in it's pages."
3,Damn hippies...,"Like Pentangle on acid. Way too much acid, and without the girl singer most of the time. Makes Donovan sound like Johnny Cash. In some ways, these guys' talents were better used as sidemen on Shirley and Dolly Collins' record The Power of the True Love Knot. They really can play, but, my god, the singing...the songs...although sometimes it's so psychedelically ridiculous, so over the top, so shameless it's kinda fun...kinda...if you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing..."
1,Bogus Mingus,"The title of this CD just happens to be the same as the title of Mingus '56 masterpiece for Atlantic records. This is nothing but a cheap Italian bootleg.This CD is a compilation of tracks from ""Pithecanthropus Erectus"" (Atlantic, 1956), ""East Coasting"" (Bethlehem, 1957), ""Mingus At The Bohemia"" (Debut, 1955) and ""Charles Mingus Quintet + Max Roach"" (Debut, 1955). The sound quality of this disc is inferior too any of the available originals. Do yourself a favour, buy the originals, they will give you the complete sessions in improved audio quality (and in most cases with added bonus material). If you're still looking for a Mingus compilation, go for the ""Ken Burns"" collection, but be warned, you may get addicted to Charles Mingus and wanting all the originals available!"
2,Belles Books book order,"Book ordered was marked as ""new"" online. Arrived in a timely fashion but was a used book.Customer service was prompt in responding to my complaint but returned book which was clearly marked for the correct address and properly weighed and affixed with correct postage could not be located by the company. Reimbursement was never given for return postage as promised and refund for book was slow -- one month later."
5,Wonderful book,"I love You: a rebus poem book by Jean Marzullo..it is wonderful. I read it to my grandson as a baby and because of the simplicity, rhyming words and picture prompts he was always engaged. He is now almost 5 and he reads it to his little sister. As an added memory, I wrote the date 1/4/05 in the cover and wrote the temperature outside, I do it every year on that date...just another fun thing for us grand parents!"
3,Old school flick,"I bought this movie on advise from my husband. It's not bad, the plot is rather easy to follow and is suspenseful enough to keep you guessing what's going to happen next. It is a movie I would recommend to someone looking for a break from the hi-tech, high budget flicks of today. This movie doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but it has a great plot and relatable characters that you find yourself routing for in the end."
4,surgical pathology dissection,"An excellent book! No gross room, autopsy room or surgical suite should be without one. The illustrations are clear and the text is very well written. Every medical student and first year pathology resident should have one."
3,not as good as i remember it to be,"just as not all wines age well this 1979 summer camp comedy just isn't as good as i remember it to be. bill murray is funny but feels tacked on to this ""rocky"" like story of camp loser becomeing the hero. it's ok but very dated now and not as funny"
2,Funny THEN... not NOW,"I was disappointed after buying this DVD. I remembered this film as being one of my favorites as a young man. Now, I can barely stay awake through this horrible movie. This is simply not funny. Period. The characters are grossly outdated and this alone makes it hard to sit through. Additionally, the audio was exceptionally poor for a DVD. My 9-year old son hated this film from start to finish. He was particularly disturbed by the ""Wodney Wabbit"" kid. This man-child was a bare to even look at. He was in need of a major fashion overhaul (at the very least a haircut). Run from this film... like a wabbit."
4,Great Memory,"The movie itself was much as I remembered. Fun, nothing groundbreaking. It was fun to see Bill Murray's comedy character in its formative stages, with a sweetness that rarely returned thereafter. Generally innocuous enough to watch with young kids, especially those to young to grasp the concept of voyeurism.Extras were much above the norm. Very good memories, especially from Ivan Reitman and his production crew. Well worth the expense."
4,"The Kids are Brats, the Food is Hideous!","No, it's not about fat guys at an Italian restaurant. It's a lovable, low-budget flick about summer camp, shot in Canada. The camp counselors have sex, but no slasher comes out of the lake to chop them up. Instead, Bill Murray takes Chris Makepeace (that kid from ""My Bodyguard"") under his wing and teaches him how to belch and talk at the same time, which brings the little guy out of his shell and makes him the most popular camper in Camp Northstar history.There are some obligatory heart-string tugs, but mostly this is just amiable, low-brow fun for the whole family. You'll find yourself chanting ""Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!"" anytime you watch someone attempt something moderately difficult. Try it on a friend, or your spouse- it's fun!"
4,Loved Meatballs On the Big Screen,Loved Meatballs in the theater. Can someone please post a review of the DVD version?
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This product is marketed by the manufacturer as a ""Deluxe Dynamic Stereo Microphone. It is NOT a stereo microphone. It is a common low-end monophonic (one channel) microphone. The photo will reveal that the plug has only two contacts, meaning one channel. Furthermore, the instructions with the microphone indicate that for stereo use, two of these microphones must be used, -one for the recorder's left jack, and one for the right. Don't make the same mistake I made. THIS IS NOT A STEREO MICROPHONE!"
3,Valuable for its info on Non-Linear story structure.,"I have found it nearly impossible to find any story structure books that deal with the rules and structure of Non-Linear storytelling, which I find rather odd. Non-linear storytelling is everywhere these days. It's definitely an under-served book market. That being said, this book contains some valuable information on the different types of non-linear story structure, and the rules by which they work or fail. It's certainly not comprehensive, and I found the rest of the book uninteresting, but it currently is the only source of this information that I am aware of. So, until something more comprehensive comes along, this is the book to go to for this information."
1,Don't buy this.,"Rec'd the item today. I haven't tried the make-up but the nose that came with it doesn't fit. You have to push or squeeze the nose onto your nose. And even after that, it barely stays on the nose. I don't have a big nose, either. Try another nose."
5,Truly enchanted,"Absolutely my favorite Christmas CD, and has been for years. I can listen to this endlessly."
4,Handler 140,"I rate this unit 5 out of 5 only because I have not used it very much. It might be rated lower with more use but for now it's a 5 out of 5. I bought it because of the many great reviews and information from people that own one. It is a very nice package, easy to set up, and came very fast from amazon. If a beginner like myself can empty the box and be welding within an hour from receiving the package, it's a good product. Heavier than I thought so a welding cart would be handy. Perfect for your garage welder or farmer but is still capable of doing beautiful welds. Using gas gives you a higher quality weld but still works good with flux core. I could go on and on about the subtle differences between welds and what it does but overall it's a great product. Can't wait to use it more."
5,Amazing!,This production was one of the best ballets I have ever seen! The sets and costumes were beautiful and very elaborate adding to the dazzle of this performance. Gillian Murphy's Odette/Odile is stunning to watch.
4,historical snapshot,"Normann Lewis is best known as a travel writer, but this book is more of a memoir of the time he spent in Naples, Italy as a soldier during World War II. As always, Lewis graces the pages with very descriptive prose, giving the reader a real feel for place and time. And his fondness for the kind but beleaguered Italian people that he meets during his time in the city comes pouring off the pages of this book. His time in Italy, even during this turbulent period in history, obviously left a lasting impression on him. Amidst the horrors of war, Lewis manages to find grace and perseverance among the suffering populace. This is an illuminating view of a period of history that has been written about often, but rarely with from a perspective of someone like Norman Lewis."
5,Thoroughly delightful and informative,"This is a real gem of a memoir-cum-diary of World War II in Naples and its environs. I have just 'discovered' Mr. Lewis, and am knocked out by his eye for detail and the transparency of his writing. The book really gives you a sense sense of the tragi-comedy of a city recently liberated from the Germans; more than that, you cannot help but be impressed with the creativeness of Neapolitans' dealings with the incredible difficulties they faced after the Germans retreated North. You will also, sadly, get a sense that the United States Army was not completely comprised of ""Band of Brothers"" soldiers. Nor, for that matter, was the British. Read this book."
5,Great Review for STEP 3,I used this book as a source of review for my STEP 3 exams and would like recommend it to everyone preparing for STEP 3.
5,Crush Step 3,I had no money to attend review classes for the exam. I have not even started my internship when I took the exam. I just used this book and First Aid Step 3 to help me prepare for the exam and I got a good mark! I recommend this book to everyone who will take Step 3.
3,"Concise, but not enough details for me","Exactly what I said in the subject. Overall, a quick reference book, but nothing special."
5,"Sacred Clowns, a Hillerman hit!","Still dealing with the loss of his beloved Emma, Lt. Leaphorn teams up with Officer Chee to investigate murder; one at a Dinee Mission school, another related, but out of their juristiction on another reservation. It's a mix of mystery and religion, loved by Hillerman fans, including Kachini rites."
3,Not his best work,"Normally, I find the Leaphorn series books quite engrossing and usually finish them in a day. With this one however, the story failed to draw me in the way the others have. I felt this book especially was more of a character introduction for Jim Chee than an outright mystery. It does provide insight into Chee's thought patterns, but I felt it focused on this area a bit too much for one novel."
5,Well Done,"This is a Jim Chee mystery. Chee has been assigned to find a young boy who has run away from school. Meanwhile, a man has been murdered at the school where the boy ran away from. While Chee is on the trail of the boy, the boy's uncle happens to be murdered almost right in front of him. Coincidence? Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn, Chee's boss, doesn't believe in coincidences. But there are no clues linking the three incidents. It's up to Chee to figure out what's been happening in case the boy is in danger.As with all of Hillerman's books, this tale is rich with detail from Navajo culture. Through Chee's eyes, we witness a Pueblo ceremonial and learn about some of the roles tribesmen play during the ritual. Despite the urgency of the situation, Chee must divide his attention between his job and his personal life, between the ethics of his tribe and the law. This book will draw you in from page one."
1,Why are people critiquing the music?,Seriously? You're given a music review on Amazon? Obviously that is not what everyone is looking for. Some people already have listened to the songs and now want to buy them.For those who people who have I would not recommend buying them here. They just don't sound the same as they do even on other MP3s that I've heard and personally I liked the way it sounded in that addition better.The music just sounded to clean and tame in comparison and that is not a complement for rock and roll.
1,I thought I was getting the movie,Why the hell would anyone pay for a long movie trailer for a movie that did not so that well at the box office?
3,Salt could use a bit more pepper in the mix,I found this movie a bit disappointing. There were some pretty good actions scenes but the the overall movie felt disjointed and didn't flow smoothly.
3,Never Saw It,"If you’re ready for the next big thing, upgrade to a new Samsung smartphone and get up to $300 for your old phone. Simply go to Samsung Upgrade to get a quote, purchase a new phone from a retailer, and mail in your old phone and proof of purchase within 30 days. A check will be mailed to you for your trade-in refund."
5,WOW!!!!,Angelina Jolie really played her part in this movie!!! I was on the edge of my seat from the very beginning!!!!
3,Salt,It was not great and would not order again. This was after we did our Amozon Prime and did not realized how much it was going to cost to download.
1,lame movie,"I wish i had never rented this movie it really was a waste of my time and money. Just sucked,"
4,Russian Spy thriller,Angelina Jolie does a good job in this spy thriller. It's not entirely believable that a woman can do that much damage but in the non real world it was fun to watch.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,This machine is worthless... It is very UNCOMFORTABLE and you can sit there and do 30mins with their tape and you don't feel anything. The back massager is a REAL PAIN and it hurts so much.
3,Kindle version could be better,"I'm not going into a review of the book itself (Which is on par with Snow Crash). This review is about the formatting of the Kindle edition.Well, there isn't really any formatting. There is no table of contents, there are no page numbers. There are giant numbers at the beginning of each chapter - it wouldn't have been hard for someone to scan through the file and add some chapter markers. The text itself is just as well-edited as the print version (I didn't catch any obvious OCR mishaps, for example), but that's all it is - text."
3,Good brain-candy; Great for a long plane ride,"This is the kind of book you would want to pick up to relax and help time pass. There's nothing here that you will remember a year after you read it. But it was fun and a good read. Not in the same galaxy with Snow Crash, the ultimate NS book."
5,This really helped,"After years of treatment and hundreds of dollars of chiropractic appointments, I finally found the device to relieve my neck pain. This works!"
5,NeckPro Cervical Traction,This cervical traction unit has been a God's send! I use it daily for a C-4 and C-5 compression. The Physical Therapist I see was totally impressed with the results. She commented that this was much better than the water bag type devices.
5,Good Product,"My wife uses this every day. It does squish your face a bit, so it is helpful to put something between the straps to keep them spread apart. Otherwise it works fine."
3,Pretty good,"If I had to do this over, I would probably buy this product again.Pros: This does relieve pressure in the neck.Cons: The door adjustment sometimes slips. I can't seem to get those wing nuts tighter.This pulls on your chin.After using this for a week or two, I needed more force during the traction. There jsut is not enough pull for complete relief for my neck. Then again, if it would pull any harder it would be more uncomfortable on your chin.So if what you need is light to moderate traction and have no jaw problems, this is the product for you. I need heavy traction and I have no jaw problems, so this is not the best product for me. But this is not a bad product by far."
3,Good for the price,"This is an alright product for the price. It has a couple of design flaws that make it uncomfortable, but some ingenuity can fix that. The price is definately a plus and no water bag."
1,a little uncomfortable,"The device is not very comfortable. Instead of pulling on the back of my head or upper neck, all of the resistence seems to be aimed around my jaw and chin. By the time I get enough resistence to feel any relief in my neck it feels like my face is getting squished. My wife tried it and said the same thing."
3,wait and see,really havn't have tried it that much yet. I would have to wait and see. The verdit is not out yet
4,Works well but needs to be stronger,"My husband uses this unit and has been happy with it for the past two weeks. This morning he went to use it and as has been reported by others, the clamp came off the door and hit him in the head. Upon inspection it was apparent that the clamp is not heavy duty enough to withstand bending which allows it to slip. I still give it a 4 rating as for the price its a good unit as long as you have the skills to modify it."
3,"WARNING, YOU MUST FACT TOWARDS THE DOOR WHEN USING","I just wanted to alert people that this product should NOT be used the way the picture shows !This device should be used ONLY IF YOU FACE TOWARDS THE DOOR ! If you have your back to the door, you risk pinching nerves in your neck, and possibly even doing nerve damage to your neck or spinal cord.YOU MUST FACE THE DOOR, as that way, the device will flex your neck forward as it creates traction. I am saying this as a medical doctor, as I know of people who have used similar neck traction devices and hurt themselves. Facing away from the door you are more likely to pull on your neck while in hyperextension and pinch nerve roots as they exit the spine, or even pinch the vertebral arteries as they travel up the back of the cervical spine. Please follow this one precaution! Thanks."
4,new funny orchestral music,"With this two works Daugherty goes on exploring the American icons in its unique way, blending classical and pop for the best and (sometimes) for the worst.The symphony ""Philadelphia Stories"" is a brillant journey across the city.Also interesting is the concerto for percussion even if a few passages seem less inspired. Another recording for this concerto exist, but then the orchestra is replaced by a ""symphonic band"" (the strings are suppressed); I felt this other version more idiomatic.Then 5 stars for the symphony and 3 for the present recording of the UFO concerto with full orchestra.That makes an average 4 stars for an album with music which can either entertain, amaze or unplease (if you do not like the second degree) !"
2,Traditional school-at-home only,"I purchased this book as a new homeschooler because it seemed to have a lot of practical information on the nuts and bolts of homeschooling. I have since gotten rid of the book, as it is only useful for those who want to do traditional school-at-home, complete with a simulated classroom, desks, reports, etc. I know some people are most comfortable with this model of homeschool, but for many people traditional school-at-home merely replicates many of the problems with traditional school, but now in a different setting. Homeschoolers of a different style -- Classical, Charlotte Mason, Montessori, Waldorf, eclectic, and obviously unschooling -- would be much better served with another book."
5,REAL metal fans cannot pass this one up,"This is the ultimate record for those that truly appreciate metal, it's warts and all. David Grohl (Who is a great musician but admittedly not the first person you think of when you think of heavy music) has assembled some of the greatest vocalists in all of metal, from the grindcore scream of Lee Dorrian (Napalm Death) to the catchy growl of Lemmy Kilminster (Motorhead). Everything about the album harkens back to the glory days of underground metal...the inspired artwork, the ""dirty"" production quality, and the nonstop intensity of all involved. Personal highlights are ""Centuries of Sin"" (featurinng Cronos from Venom,) ""Shake Your Blood"" (with Lemmy) and ""Red War"" (with Max Cavelera of Sepultura/Soulfly...In short, this album is for aficinados of thrash/metal/death metal/grindcore....people who think Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit are ""heavy"" will be in for a shock if they give this one a spin."
3,"David, son of Kurt","Is Dave Grohl a genius? It sure seems that way. After the terrible band Nirvana destroyed itself, a righteous move from any angle, Grohl made a move to form perhaps the best straight rock band in the last fifteen years the Foo Fighters. And now, we have a homage to 80's metal in Probot. I certainly hope that with this template, Grohl is telling us to seek the previous works of those who have collaborated with him on this album. Such undeniable voices as King Diamond, Cronos, Max Calvera, need to be sought after in their respective groups (Venom, King Diamond, Sepultura- not Soulfly!). If this was Grohl's mission, hopefully he succeeds, and we all find the offerings from these excellent groups which are far better than what Probot brings us now, and Grohl is a genius. If not, please Mr. Grohl stick to the Foo Fighters and never touch metal again."
3,Don't listen to da piece dog,"do not listen to da peace dog's comments. he knows nothing of metal. kip winger? a great singer? get real. im not here to say ""go buy the album"". im just here to say listen for yourself, don't base your decisions off of lame comments such as da peace dogs."
1,This isnt metal!..its plastic or wood or sumthin,"I read a good review about this cd on blender magazine, since blender reviews are almost all the time dead on, I got this cd. I was extremely disapointed, the only song i really liked is the 2nd one : red war with sepultura's Max Cavalera. Unfortunatly its all downhill from there...WAY down...the vocals on the 3rd track get on my nerves I listenned to it 30 secondes and i cant stand lemmy's voice. the rest of the songs are either too repetetive or extremely weird. This album sounds more punk than metal. I guess punk fans would apreciate this cd..if ur looking for a good metal record look elsewhere."
5,Outstanding reference for all martial arts schools,"If you currently own or plan on opening a martial arts studio, you need ""Black Belt Management"" by John Graden. The chapters of information are structured in an easy to read format that allow immediate use and implementation. I couldn't put the book down. I kept finding page after page of resourceful information. This book and the NAPMA system will be the corner stone of our successful Tae Kwon Do studio. THANK YOU JOHN!!!"
3,Brightest KC makes but...,"This is KC's replacement for their 385K candlepower sealed beam. This reflector, combined with their 2766, H-3 bulb, is a fair replacement for the sealed beam they no longer make. I'm not unhappy with it but it's surely not a true replacement for the older bulb."
3,It is a nice mousepad,"This is a nice mousepad. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with any three of my mouses which are Logitech M510. I use it for a drink pad until I change mouses sometime in the future if ever. However, the cardboard backing that came with the mouse works great with my mouse!"
1,NOT UP TO HER STANDARDS,"MS STEEL'S LAST FIVE BOOKS, INCLUDING THIS ONE, HAVE GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE IS JUST CRANKING THEM OUT JUST TO HAVE ANOTHER BOOK IN THE STORES. THE STORIES ARE SIMPLISTIC WITH VERY LITTLE RESEARCH. HER BOOKS SUCH AS JEWELS, ZOYA, THURSTON HOUSE AND MESSAGE FROM NAM ARE EXAMPLES OF THE GREAT DANIELLE STEEL STYLE. IF SHE KEEP UP HER CURRENT TREND OF NOTHINGLESS SHE WILL LOSE A LOT OF DIEHARD STEEL FANS. THIS BOOK IS A ONE DAY READ WITH LITTLE PLEASURE. NOT WORTH THE DAY."
1,Fuggedaboutit,"I'm not a big fan of this author, but since I have enjoyed some of her earlier work (""The Promise""), I thought I would give this book a chance when I found it at the library.The storyline was incredibly boring. I didn't care a bit for the characters - they were like cardboard cutouts - too perfect in the begining and so nauseatingly lovey-dovey that I felt queasy. I couldn't finish it - I read the last few pages to see if I had missed anything in the previous chapters - I hadn't.Don't waste your time."
2,Steele Is Slipping,"Ok, now I know my own limitations and I cannot even write one book, let alone as many as Ms. Steele has. However, in ""Irresistible Forces"", we get standard Steele fare. One wife, Meredith, an investment banker, married to an up and coming physician, Steven. The plot revolves around Meredith being offered the dream job by Cal Dow--a sneaky, successful character. A bi-coastal marriage turns into maudlin melodrama.As I have mentioned in other reviews, I like Danielle Steel. I prefer her earlier works which have more research and history propelling the story. Such as ""The Ghost"".other reading suggestions: ""The Long Road Home"" by Danielle Steel and ""Grand Passions"" by Jayne KrentzThanks for your interest & comment votes--CDS"
3,"Irresistible Forces, not too irresistible","I have been an avid Danielle Steel reader for years and with every book you find likes and dislikes. With Irresistible Forces I found Steve to be and honest and hard working individual trying to make the best out of a busy trauma unit, i enjoyed the way Steel sent her lady character around the world on a working business trip with a handsome, sophisticated, wealthy man with no hanky panky, it showed that Merrie had integrity, that she was committed to her husband.. As a dislike, the story was drawn out, it could have been done in less words, there was a lot of repetitiveness, i didn't feel really connected with the characters, you couldn't get into the storyline with them... I'll still add it to my collection of Steel novels but the chances of reading it again are slim to none... Not her best work..."
4,Helpful,This book helped be relized that although two people do love each other they do drift apart and the relationship should end. I don't think what Meredith did to Steve was right at all and how could she really and truly love him when she committed adultery.
1,Boring Book,This is not one of Danielle's best books. The story could have been good but the same theme goes on and on too long. It is too slow moving for me.
2,Irresistible Forces,"Being a first time reader of Danielle Steel, I was very disappointed. The main characters ""Steve"" and ""Merrie"" protrayed the role of two lovers with complicated lives. The same plot continued throughout the book, leaving the ending predictable. Steel talked about the same idea over and over all through the book. Steve and Merrie are constantly telling people how much they love each other although they never have a free minute to be together. It was easy to tell what would happen in the end just by reading the middle of the novel. Steel needs to add a good twist to the end also adding some originality."
2,This can't be Danielle Steel!,"This is the worst book I've ever read by Danielle Steel. I kept looking at the author's name to be sure it was hers. So boring, so repetitive, I got so frustrated with reading the same information over & over just arranged differently. She has some wonderful books out but pass on this one."
1,Not worth 7 cents...,"I agree with many of the reviews I read on this page. This book is just the most aweful Danielle Steel book I have ever read-and I have read a lot! I pretty much abhored the main character and her rationalizations for cheating on her husband. I felt as if D. Steel was approving adultery. Usually I can't put down a D. Steel book...but, with IF, I wanted to throw it down and step on it repeatedly! If I could give it negative stars I would."
1,disappointed,Never received the product. Not a good way to do business. Will not order from them again.
1,"Bad paper, bad paginating","The whole book is very soft and very fragile. Paper on cover and inside block is very thin. But the most crucial thing that is page numbers and pages subsequently misplaced, i.e. all left pages are odd (73, 115, 251 etc) and all right pages are even (4, 88,166 etc). Dont buy this reprint!"
2,Its an O.K. Book,"Good historial review of calligraphy, but would not recommend it as a good reference book if you are looking for something to guide and show you how to do calligraphy. Recommend ""Encyclopedia of Calligraphy"" instead. I purchased first edition many years ago, and accidentally bought this one again. Oh well..."
3,"Some good recipes, but don't expect restaurant bread recipes","I checked this book out from the library hoping to find the recipes for many of the breads Panera makes and markets. No such luck. Like previous reviewers state, the only authentic Panera restaurant recipes are for a few sandwiches and soup items. Still the focaccia bread recipe was very good as was the sourdough (though this recipe is available on Panera's web site). I don't think I'll buy the book because I can get recipes similar to the basic bread recipes the book offers just by surfing the net."
3,RAPE SCENE-not needed even considering era,"I feel that the rape scene was horrible and totally out of character for Clayton. It seems that it is portraying the idea that he was driven to do it by some uncontrollable jealous rage, implying that he cared for her so deeply and was so jealous of the idea of her being with anybody else. His passion was so high that he did such a violent thing. Its like a fantasy with some women, I guess. But, it totally took me by surprise. We didn't have to see his virility by having him rape her! And the number of times he didn't trust her and didn't bother to clarify the numerous misunderstandings? He was ridiculous. And the way he talked to her? It was ludicrous. TAKE THE RAPE SCENES OUT! I DON'T CARE WHAT ERA IT IS. (this has nothing to do with the author's writing style, which is excellent and probably very under-rated) 5 Stars for her superb writing and eloquent dialogue."
2,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY,"This book is not worth the money.After spending one hour on it I was already regretting it.First of all the the main character Whitney is not the type of herione that you would think of in this story.She is flighty,childish, and wild.The man she is supposed to marry is much older and is supposed to fall in love with her and she doesnt even know him.This story has too many twists and events that are not even logical,and sometimes makes you hate the hroes charecter,insteading of liking our hero.All in all the book is not worth the effort,the time,or the money either."
1,"Dark, One dimensional ...Hero??","After reading the reviews of Whitney, My Love, I eagerly awaited my copy. Sadly, this book was by far the worst I have read by Judith McNaught. Clayton Westmoreland, is supposed to be the hero of this story, but he is anything but that. He is manipulative, and dark. McNaught wrote him as one dimensional...a man who believes anyone and everything can be bought and owned. He is violent as evidenced by the rape of Whitney and subsequent dismissal of her with a large check. This is romance???? This is a hero???? I think not!! Thank goodness McNaught got so much better the more books she turned out. If you are interested in McNaught's books, let me recommend ""Almost Heaven"" or ""Until you"""
3,"""Abusive Heroine""","I have to agree with those that said, this book was off for a good start. However, as the story moves on the hero Clayton becomes very abusive towards the heroine. The story is not bad. Rather entertaining. I liked the heroines character. she is loving, spicy and, a little naive. The cat and mouse fighting became a little tiresome. Very weak ending, considering how he treated her."
3,Doesn't Stand Up to the Test of Time,"When I first started reading romance, Whitney, My Love was one of my favorite books. So, after finding myself stuck in an airport, I picked it up again to see what McNaught had done to revise the book. Unfortunately, I can't say the book is as good as I originally thought. All the contrived misunderstandings got to be too much, and I wanted to smack Whitney herself.Don't get me wrong, this is not a horrible book. However, it isn't as good as the reviews below would have you believe. I think romance writing has evolved beyond Whitney -- and the revisions only emphasize the antiquated writing and plot. I suggust reading Mary Balogh or Mary Jo Putney if you're looking for a good (longer) regency. Like Kathleen Woodiwiss, Judith McNaught's day is past."
2,Mass of contradictions,"It's so wishy washy how both characters are.First he realizes that she's untouched when she wouldn't let him get to second base. Fast forward 6 chapters where he's furious when he hears a rumor she's slept with dozens of men.Second, she loves Paul. No Nicholas. No Paul. No Claremont. NO Paul. No Claremont. Hate Claremont. No love him. Hate him again. Then Marry him. Then hate him again. Then Love him. UGH.Then there's this back and forth of will they and won't they after he basically rapes her, that really is a mess of a time.Then he thinks she's pregnant with a bastard child. And figures out that 8 months was the engagement time she asked for and she wouldn't be THAT much of an idiot if she was pregnant. So he runs to her begging for forgiveness which she gives easily.If this was a real couple, they would die by murder suicide."
1,very disappointing,"I am very disappointed in this book I have read nearly all of Judith McNaught's books and have loved them all I have read Until You and Miracles - the two sequals to Whitney my Love and I thoroughly enjoyed them.I do not know what happened to this one, first of all - there is no need at all for rape even if it is committed by an act of love, the book seemed to be more about lust and sex than love. I think it was rather stupid to have them breaking up again after they had declared their love for each other. I actually don't think Clayton would have skipped to that conclusion after reading the letter. It was rather far fetched and it made the story drag on too long.certainly not one of her best!! :("
5,My All Time Favorite Book,"This is one of my top two favorite romance books ( the other being ""When Angels Fall"" my Meghann McKinney). I have read it 3 times over the years. Judith McNaught knows how to capture you and pull you into the room with the characters. They live and breathe and feel. Judith knows how to put the perfect amount of conflict mixed in with the underlying attraction both characters have for eachother. It's not real if there is no conflict and there is plenty of conflict in this book, but underneath it is a deep attraction. So those that call it abusive don't understand the makings of a great love story. Clay and Whitney are passionate, flawed humans. They are both strong willed characters that make mistakes but in doing so, learn how much they love the other and realize what they are willing to let go because of their deep love for the other person. I laughed and cried...It was heartbreaking, funny, witty and above all... Romantic!"
2,Here's the thing...,"I'm not a picky person, truly. This plot has many flaws, evaluated in great detail by other reviews here, so I shall not reiterate them. These are tolerable in a book in which you are able to form an emotional connection to the main characters and root for their best interests. In this case, I would not have minded a bit if this book had ended with Clayton's carriage going up in a giant fireball, with him in it. This is a problem."
2,Happy Ending???,Not forseen. The Hero was horrible. I kept hoping that he'd do something to redeem himself. I was shocked when after the misunderstanding (him ruining her & all) he chucked some money her way and disappeared from her life. I wondered if not for Emily would he have come back? Why was Nicolas in the book? I thought he'd give Clayton a run for his money. Whitney should have ended up with Nicki.
2,A disappointment,"Although I enjoyed the other Judith McNaught books, Whitney, My Love really disappointed me. Clayton's physical abuse of Whitney was the biggest turn-off. What a brute! I really wanted to like the characters, but with their lack of emotional maturity, I just couldn't."
5,WOW......I LOVED this book!,"This is the best book I've read in a while. I didn't know what to expect. It is a long book and I thought the other Judith McNaught book that I've read had over a hundered of unnecessary pages so I was a bit wary but I'm glad I took the plunge. It was worth reading every page. I loved the characters, especially the heroine. McNaught made her so real and I felt as though I knew her character so well. It was heart-wrenching and took a lot of turns, and I liked all of the characters and was never bored. We all encounter and make mistakes in life in some way or another...this book reflects that aspect of life. That's what makes it more real and more appealing to me as a reader. Highly recommend!"
2,I don't get it.,"I am new to Judith McNaught, but having recently finished ""Until You"", which I thoroughly enjoyed, I wanted to read about the characters when they were first introduced. So I went to ""Whitney, My Love"". I'm sorry I did. I couldn't even finish it. In ""Until You"", Whitney and Clayton are so loving and have such humor and obvious attraction in their marriage - in ""Whitney"", I can't see how they arrived there. Looking at the other reviews I guess I have obviously missed the boat. Although some reviewers agree with me. Really disappointing."
5,What a Beautiful Book,"The author has definitely done his homework. We are in the process of creating a courtyard in our back yard after having added a sunroom this past season. Our theme has been ""New Orleans"" for the sunroom ... even though we live in a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, we have visited New Orleans many times and consider it our ""home away from home"". There are courtyards from New Orleans featured in this book - but many from other places as well. Whatever you are looking for in courtyard ideas, you will find it here."
3,browbeater's brunette eyebrow pencil (urban decay),This was a fun product to try. I liked it especially because the color was a softer brown and not as harsh and dark as some that are also available. It was also interesting in that it has a wax pencil on the opposite end of the brow pencil. This is nice to help keep stray hairs in place and looking professional but the wax tip does break off easily. I would purchase this product again
2,Go to the website,"I bought this book when Python was relatively young and it definitely got the job done on more than a few occasions. The language (and the book) has evolved and some of the recipes are a bit outdated. If you look up Python Cookbook recipes on Google or some other search engine, it will take you to the ActiveState site that has all of these recipes and more. Two stars because the book is valuable in that it is concise - searching through a slew of recipes on a site can be a bit of a chore."
3,Out of date. Not very useful.,"This book is in need of an update for Python 2.6/3.0 syntax. It covers the ""new"" Python 2.4.I bought the book for a project in Python at work, but I never even consulted it once. YMMV."
1,For beginners,"Other reviews on this book indicated that it was the best book for advanced Unix users. I found it to be the opposite, very little advanced topics, even those that are part of the GUI are covered. OS X for Dummies and Unix for Dummies would be a better choice. I would even venture to say the book is for computer beginners as it actually explains what an icon is. This would be for someone who hasn't used a computer since 1983."
4,So far this is quite good! I am very new to Apple-land!,"Recently, I decided to broaden my computer knowledge (I am an MCSE,MCT,MCDBA,CCNA,CCAI,A+ - so my PC and networking skills are there, just no Mac). To better understand Apple OSX I looked at the OSX Complete Reference as well as this text.So far, I am more impressed with this text in terms of sheer depth of information. It doesn't have the programming sections that ""OSX Complete Reference"" does, but I wonder if that is really needed. From the sections I have read, it seems to provide enough depth to get started comfortably and bring myself up to speed.It is evident that the author understands OSX as the references to third-party tools and references are well placed and valid.As a ""how-to-use-it"" book I am enjoying it. Next, I'll have to find a text that gets into the internal workings."
1,Wrong size on product - bad experience,"We received the product on time, new, looks good quality, but it did not have the same size of other similar products that we got locally. Vendor has very nice people but it was too expensive returned under return product policy; as a result was donated to the salvation army. Never try again this kind of purchase online."
4,Review of Metroland,"Mostly I see Christian Bale in American films with an American accent. Here he's in an English movie using his native English accent. I gave this film four stars because it has long nude scenes of both Emily Watson and Elsa Zyberstein. Emily is Christian's wife, but she's jealous of his old girlfriend Elsa, even though Elsa lives in France and Emily in England."
2,"Not tango or waltz, it's all folkloric music.","I guess because of the lack of listenable tracks on Amazon, I wasn't able to tell that this was a Folklore CD. I had heard of Ariel Ramirez in the context of Tango, and his Waltzes CD is great, but this one -- eh, it was a waste of my money since I had bought it thinking that I could use it for tango dancing, which you really can't.To be fair, the problem is not the CD itself, but Amazon's lacking the audio content, but yeah, if you're looking for tango, then look elsewhere."
4,"Great music, great performance; one star deducted for no notes in English","Unlike the prior reviewers, I am not a long-time aficionado of this piece. I first heard the Carreras version only a couple of weeks ago and found it pleasant enough, but this is quite different. The Carreras recording sounds like a piece for operatic tenor with choral and instrumental backup. This one really blends the soloist, the chorus, and the various instruments. In short, it is more musical.Sorry to break the string of 5s, but in a multi-lingual set of notes, it surprises me that none of the languages was English. I don't know what market this recording is aiming for, but it seems not to be the U.S. Too bad. I would very much have liked to see a libretto, short enough as it is. So the missing fifth star is for the package, not the performance."
4,Great USMLE/COMLEX review source,This book is great! I've been using it in conjunction with Master the Boards for the past 3 weeks now and I think that provides a comprehensive and high yield review. I did notice a mistake in the book today. They reverse the definitions of hypospadius and epispadius on page 322. Just make sure to change it if you buy the book. Other than that I am very happy with this purchase!
3,A Modest Treatise on Visual Genetics,"This is modest, yet suitable, book for an introductory class on visual genetics. It would work well in a M.D. or PhD program focused on that course of study."
1,BE CAREFUL!,The Safety Red color is 10X the price of the regular colors. BE CAREFUL unless you want to spend $64.58 on a can of spray paint!
4,Just one glitch.....,"This is an awesome collection of FUN music, and I love this CD....BUT.....it will not play on my PC, so I was not able to download it to my iPod. Ended up buying it again, through iTunes. No big deal, but the description should make it a little more clear that this will not play on your PC. I did not notice that little box on the front cover of the picture of the album....my fault I guess. Anyway, if you want the CD go for it. But if you want to put this music on your iPod, go to the iTunes store and download it for $9.99."
3,A diverse collection of short films.,"Destricted is a collection of short films by seven filmmakers dealing with the subject of pornography. There is explicit sex, strobing effects, and some strange depictions of pornography. Director Larry Clark (Ken Park) interviews several young men who would like to have sex with a porn star. The chosen guy then interviews several porn stars and selects one. The rest of Clark's film is actual porn. This film is coded Region 2, so the DVD will not play on most players sold in North America. If you are fortunate enough to have the manufacturer's code to change your player to region 0 or 2, the disk will be playable."
3,"Beautiful looking, but","We didn't like the story. My 11 year old said, ""kinda depressing."" I thought it went on too long. ,,"
5,wholesome values,"With all the negative books that are written today,I feel comfortable with my children reading this book.I read it myself and enjoyed it very much. Lisa Lee"
5,Realistic Issues,"Matchstick is a great book for the young and old. Readers can relate how a kid moving into a new neighborhood can encounter a school bully and how he handles all the fears and apprehension. Children can relate with encouragement of their fears with the help of faith, and their belief regardless of opposition.Andrew Cocco did a great job in handlling the behavior of a sixth grader and the kids' attitudes are very realistic. I would recommend this book to anyone especially a young person struggling with peer pressure. Hope to see more book with other realistic issues."
1,Ugh - Take out the mint!,We used to drink this all of the time - for years - then it disappeared. When I found a box I was thrilled! Until I brewed it...Celestial Seasonings changed the recipe and added peppermint! Seriously?!?! So instead of that lovely bright flavor we remember so fondly you get something that tastes like liquid chewing gum - yuck. Our family is not fond of mint teas. Guess we are back to SV Teas until CS (HOPEFULLY) change it back.
5,Great baby cream too!,"I started using this on my 12 month old son who has very sensitive skin in the winter months. He gets dry patches on his belly and back. I slather this all over him after his bath and in the morning before I dress him. He has no reaction to it and his dry patches disappeared completely. Compared to some ""sensitive skin"" baby creams which turned out to be irriitating to his skin the price is comparable or better and the jar lasts quite a long time. The mild scent smells great...not girly which is great for my little boy. He's almost two now and I still use it...even in the summer. I can still find it in my grocery store in the organic section. I love it!"
2,Rich--but not for daily use,"I prefer the 5,000 IU creme over this 25,000 IU. I have dry skin, but this product is much too heavy to use on my face. It is good to use time-to-time at night when I need a heavy moisturizing dose. But for daily use, stick to the lighter-weight product. I also mix the two on my hand when I need a heavier application."
5,Good book that needs to be updated,"Great book, great drawings and tables. I found it very informative. We need more books like this."
2,Better Books Out There,"I originally thought this book would help with writing a ""dear birthmother"" letter, but then consider the full title (which isn't obvious from the cover) ""Dear Birthmother, Thank You for Our Baby."" I had read a couple other books about the emotions people feel from all sides of the adoption triad, and this one repeats those, if not dumbs it down. The letters included are real conversation between triad members, but the author reiterates things that were just said in the letter, like we didn't just read it! Or she'll give a summary of how a person feels about their child or the adoption, then follow it up with the letter saying the same thing.This book was not a page turner until I got to the last quarter of the book, then it introduced something I had not seen in my other readings. Making Sense of Adoption by L. Melina and The Open Adoption Book by B. Rappaport are much better reads."
2,too short effective time period,"Although the product is effective and reasonably priced, it was not as convenient as the premixed urine enzyme cleaners I have used previously. This one is a powder that must be mixed with a cup of water and wait 5 minutes to dissolve then add rest of water. Then it must be used within 4 hours for peak effectiveness. I tend to have spots that occur sporadically in my house and so I prefer something premixed and that has a longer shelf life."
3,An impressive soundtrack,"I like the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian--starring Arnold Schwarzenegger--and was intrigued enough with the music to acquire this soundtrack. Basil Poledouris has done an impressive job with this music. Not only is there orchestration, but there is also choral work. This soundtrack is rich, dramatic, stately, ominous, mysterious, touching, dynamic, and somber. There are 12 tracks. The sound quality is pleasing, too. My favorite compositions are ""Theology/Civilization"" and ""The Orgy."" The disc is just over 49 minutes. I actually rate this recommendable piece of work 3.5 stars."
4,gearwrench 16 piece nut driver set,"This is a decent product, I would have rather it been made in the USA, but I knew it wasn't since that was reflected in its price. Anyone out there looking for USA made tools need only look at the price, if its cheap, its an import from china or Taiwan. Its quality is decent and it holds up to some abuse, but its no snapon or cornwell. If your a full time mechanic, don't look here for something that will last. Spend the money and go snap-on."
3,messy,"I bought this for my six-year-old daughter to have something to do on the plane, but after we tried the first one at home, I saw that it really couldn't/shouldn't be done in a plane. It is very messy, which I didn't expect. While drawing the pictures, you rub off quite a lot of black ""shaving"" and it gets everywhere. I would recommend this book for home, but not for a plane or even in the car. Other than the mess, the pictures were easy to draw, and she had a lot of fun with it."
1,not sure what to think...,"i'm not sure what to think about this release and why it was even released.first of all, the quality of this movie/concert isn't that great. it's like they were trying to make a 50's dance hop complete with 50's garb etc. i can't tell if the band is really playing or acting.secondly the whole movie is about 25 minutes long with a 30 minute making of video on the back end to fill the space.not worth the money.bill wyman should have just kept this for his own private collection."
5,Everyone Needs a Refresher Course,"I got this book when originally published, and find myself referring to it more often as I am being called upon to write more scripts these days. It's good for anyone who is learning to write as these fundamentals should never be forgotten."
1,This workout does not include your baby!,"I bought this video thinking that it would be a good way to exercise and entertain my baby at the same time. Big mistake! This video only includes a 4 minutes segment with the baby and it is lame! So, if you are looking for something fun to do with your baby, this is not it. Also, it involves a step portion so if you don't have a step then you will not be able to do the entire cardio portion. It also requires free weights or an xertube which you can get with a different version but I was not aware of this so I could not do the weight portion. All in all, I was extremely disappointed!"
1,"i'd give it zero stars if i could, this isn't worth my time","i tried this to add soem variety to my post prego workouts, and i found it very disappointing....the workout really doesn't even include your baby, the bands are used, which are ok, but the whole concept of working out with your baby is exagerated here...i would save my money next time and skip this one."
1,A VERY BORING BOOK,"its a very very boring wrting style and has no material except of science history, if any body is looking for a hisory book.. then he will not find a better one, if there were less than a star for rating i would give it to this book, i recommend hyper space for kaku for any body looking for a nice science book."
2,Pass this one up,I must be dense because I did not get it. I watched 3/4 of the movie and could not take it any longer and had to turn it off. I don't see why so many gave a five star rating to this movie.
2,"I Minor, Boring Film","How anyone can deem this silly movie ""Brilliant"" is beyond me. It was deliberately confusing, and often boring. The sex scenes were unpleasant, and frequent enough, I think, to ensure that this film never finds a wide audience. The characters were unbelieveable, their actions gratuitous and cliched. This movie might appeal to an audience looking specifically for a ""gay"" movie, but if you're looking for a GOOD movie, keep looking. (If you want a good ""gay"" movie, try ""A Man of No Importance,"" with Albert Finney. It is a character-driven movie, not an agenda-driven one.)"
5,highly recommended!,"The story is about love, self-preservation and revenge. A unique and poignant story."
2,Not up to usual standard,"I usually enjoy the good storytelling and engaging style of Modesitt's characters. However, I could not help but feel that I had missed something from the very beginning of this book. The introduction of unexplained terms and frames of reference left me wondering if I had missed explanations and by extension, unengaged. Also, the characters seemed morally ambivalent. Since they were so lukewarm, I could not warm to them nor be chilled by them -- again, unengaging. Nonetheless I pushed myself through it and found myself glad to be done.Oh well, everyone has a bad day. Will keep reading (actually enjoyed his other -- Natural Ordermage)."
3,Bat 21,"This is a great production ranking up there with ""Flight of the Intruder"" types. Certain facts were changed slightly and there were cuts removed from the original version. But with the star line up, I always enjoy seeing this overall winner again and had to have a copy of my own.Thank youH. Velez, Florida USA"
5,Would buy from again! Fast Shipping!,"Item arrived very fast and in excellent condition. Highly recommend this seller, it just doesn't get any better than this!"
2,Purchase of ORIS Watch,the detail information about the watch that not contained information about the black rubber circle surrounding the watch . If I knew about this feature I would have not purchase it.
3,Meh,"We have several of these placemats. Some of the others - specifically, the maps - have been way more useful to us. This may be partially my fault because my daughter already knew her colors and a decent amount of shapes. Still, this one inspired almost no interest from the kids. Shapes and colors are easily learned in other ways (that you already own), I'd say give this one a miss."
2,title wrong,"BS on this. 7ft came, not 17. It seems to work well enough, but almost none came in the package."
2,Large actually means small here,Somehow I missed reading the dimentions of the silocone lid...It said large and I assumed it would be large enough for a regular pot/plate. This is tiny and only fits the smallest bowl/pot that I have...Product works but I think the title is very deceptive.
2,Measurements are wrong,"I'm sorry to give this such a low rating but the measurements on the page are wrong. I should have realized this when they gave 3 sizes for a round object but I still (wrongly) assumed the largest measurement was the size.The large lid actually measures 6 1/12"". The small lid (which BTW Progressive calls a 'mini' on the cardboard tag) measures 4"".So...I thought I was buying one 8"" and one 6"" and in reality I got a 6 1/2"" and a 4"".I have notified Amazon by phone and they assured me they would make a correction. We will see.I have a 10"" lid from a purchase somewhere else and it works great."
2,disappointed,"Shipped here fast, but it looked like the discs were messed up and some episodes would scramble because of it....and i bought it new.....disappointing"
1,Owl,THe revolving head works like a weathervane. It stays turned the same direction all the time when the wind blows. It dosen't scare ANYTHING away !! Waste of money.
3,Rotating Head Great Horned Owl-head does NOT rotate easily,"Nice product - looks great, easy to fill with sand to give stability; however head does not easily rotate that we've seen so far."
5,I could not believe it!,"AS soon as our tomatoes would rippen, something would peck at them. I put up one of your owls and we have not had a pecked tomato since. Great invironmentally safe product. I did learn that you need to move it once in while so it seems even more real."
5,Great place to get ideas!,"I was planning on buying an $8 or $9 pattern for chair covers for my rather tacky looking dining chairs. But I'm so glad that I bought this book instead! Katrin Cargill covers chairs in many ways. Even me on my frugal budget, have some ideas I can immediately put into use. She covers many ways to dress a window, many ways to decorate all the rooms of one's house, and even though I know she has used top-notch expensive fabrics, some of them NOT! Some are very easy to put into use! I even found an idea for a quilt I've been wanting to make, using my late husband's shirts! I found just exactly the right pattern for the fabric that I have! I'm very happy with this purchase. I bought the older 1996 book, gently used, of course. You will be amazed at how big this book is and how much it cost retail! Just my first time through the book, I put markers on three pages to come back to later. Very happy with this volume!"
3,Battery for sony dsc-v1,Does not last long at all.. Its an old camera what can I Expect.. Last for a few pictures and thats it..
1,"not so good, in fact junk",I bought this as this original battery for my digital cammera would no longer hold a charge. This battery was worse than the one that I was replacing. I would srongly advise everyone not to buy these batteries
1,Save your money,"I found this book to be the biggest waste of my time and money that any medicial book could be. I wouldn't have finished it, but I have to review it for a class. I chose this book because it looked like a fresh look at infertility. Now I realize she only has two points to make with this book. One, some treatments that infertile patients undergo have long term side effects. Two, there isn't much research to show the rate of ""spontaneous"" conceptions versus IVF and similar treatments. Would you like to be the control of that study? She hammers that people could get pregnant on their own if they tried longer. Nice thought, but if you to the put where you are considering IVF or GIFT, another 5 years is a long time. In addition to her research, I also found the writing to be poor. She used overly techinical language and writing when there was rarely a need."
3,kids socks,"These socks are very cute but there was no size given. I ordered them anyways taking a chance that they would fit, turns out they are very little kids sizes... they are cute on my co-workers toddler."
3,Rock All Night,"Excellent beginning by the Platters. Considering the short video duration of the Platters, its well worth the price just to see and hear them."
3,Has its moments,"I bought these to help provide some distraction while riding on the trainer for the winter. Video is decent, and subject matter is good for the indoor riding -- good scenery, other riders, etc. I had no intent, nor do I use the heart rate, rpm, shifting suggestions, etc on these videos. I also listened to the cyclist's commentary once. Once was enough. Needs to chat less and ride more.Provides a good distraction for an hour or so when you match it with your own tunes to keep you moving.I will say that I'm glad I'm only riding with this guy via the DVD. He must be a BEAST on the cycle - he passes each and every rider he comes upon. However, he also has horrible riding manners. Half-wheeling, passing on the right, weaving all over the road when climbing hills, etc. I'd not want to be anywhere near this guy on the road - not that I could likely keep up with him anyhow."
2,"Unengaging characters, setting, and situation","I have to admit that the area of organized religious hierarchies and their trappings is not one I am very interested in. That said, I felt that this book failed for me in several ways: 1. I didn't feel for the characters 2. Thus, when the characters were in danger, I did not feel any suspense. 3. I didn't care about the pre-1989 Soviet bloc country or the religious organization inside of that country, further reducing my interest in the outcome. 4. The internal religious moral arguments the main character has with himself are represented by short and summary resolutions - this topic (and others) don't seem to be explored, as much as thrown out and discarded. 5. The detail was very sparse, and I wasn't drawn into the setting.After finishing the book, I felt as though I had wasted my time."
1,Not For All Doors,"We installed this on a wood frame door and after a few days the wood began to crack on the frame. This product is made well but is not as the package states ""for all doors"".I do not doubt that it would work well on an all metal frame door or metal framed gate. The key issue being that the door frame should be able to withstand the compression of the two very powerful springs that the Kant-Slam uses to close the door, upon opening the door these springs compress, and require the frame to be the opposing stress point to push against.Its a little difficult to describe how the Kant Slam functions and the company ([...]) would do well to create a flash video to allow potential users to see it before purchasing."
1,JUNK,"This thing is big, chunky, ugly, and does not work well. I was hesitant to install it and 6 months later the welds on the hinge broke. DONT BUY IT!"
4,If you just can't get enough of AB,"This book isn't bad, though I expected more for the price. It takes the key points from his other 2 books specifically regarding tools of the kitchen and elaborates on them. It's an excellent reference for gadget shopping. It's your own personal hard-bound ""W"" without the put-downs.You may have noticed that there are no brand labels shown in the later Good Eats episodes for licensing reasons. Not the case with this book. He tells you straight out which brands he prefers. No more late-night Google image searches comparing video footage to actual models.I received this as a gift and I'm very happy to have it. But if you're on a budget... Well, if you're on a budget, don't bother with cook-books! But if you're torn between his cook-book, bake-book, and this gear-book, get the cook-book & bake-book."
4,A really mixed bag,"This book appears to be a collection of someone's (or some committee's) favorite articles from The Baffler, a literary magazine whose main job seems to be poking jabs at our culture. The title certainly doesn't help in determining that as ""Boob"" itself is such a multi-use word nowadays. Furthermore, many Americans west of the Mississippi have never heard of the New Economy and could care less about about literary criticism.I think the audience for this book is really limited and not consistent with the title or the book cover. However, once you get past the first couple of reallllly dry essays, there are some that are worthy of more attention."
2,Mr Coffee Leaks,I purchased this coffee pot in Oct 2009 and it made good coffe for 15 months. One day my wife was making coffee and when she poured the water in it immediately started running out the bottom of the coffee pot. It was the strangest thing because the day before I made coffee with it and it was just fine. The filter does a good job filtering. It is easy to set the time. Other than the water leaking I thought the coffee was all right. I think the unit should have lasted longer than 15 months.
1,i will never buy another mr coffe again!,this has to be the worst coffe pot ive ever had first off its supposed to keep your coffee warm but it doesnt it shuts off after awhile (my old one that wasnt a mr coffee used to stay on and if i wanted coffee throughout the day it was always hot) and secondly the lid is horribly made everytime you try to pour it it runs down the side no matter what you try it is a screw top however if you take the whole lid off to try and pour it it still spills i would never recomend this to anyone!
1,Mr. Who? Certainly not COFFEE!,"We had high hopes for our new Mr. Coffee with the thermal carafe. The first pot we made was lukewarm at best and we were disappointed. That's when we noticed the instructions about pre-heating the carafe. Isn't heating supposed to be part of the function of the coffee maker? I really hated the filling guide on the front of the carafe, too. Very hard to see when the maker is full and all too often, the water is running all over the counter from a little hole in the back of the maker. I think Mr. Junk is posing as Mr. Coffee."
1,Coffee cool within 20 minutes,"We purchased this 6 weeks ago. Our coffee must be microwaved if brewed 20 minutes before drinking. They recommend warming carafe with hot water before brewing. However, if you use the carafe to pour in cool water for brewing you then need to fill the carafe with hot water and let it sit 10 minutes or so to heat carafe, pour out water and then start brewing - no thank you! Also that doesn't work at all if you want to delay brew. I called customer service and they said to try removing carafe from coffee maker after brewing. Apparently, if it sits on the plate ( which doesn't get warm) the top stays open allowing your coffee to cool. This is not mentioned in the instruction book. Total waste of money for our family."
1,Worst Coffee Pot EVER,"We decided to splurge on a more expensive coffee machine with the previous one died. We thought the carafe was a nice feature to keep the coffee warm on the weekends as we drink it slower. What a waste of money! I am going back to our $15 sale special coffee maker. Worked okay for about two months, though it was ""tempermental"" sometimes and we would find water overflowing on the counter. Last night I walk into the kitchen to find it spewing coffee grounds and hot water all over the counter and floor! I tried ""working with it"" a couple times, but it is done. I cannot get it to work right this morning. WHAT A WASTE! I will say the carafe kept the coffee hot for several hours though. Too bad."
1,carafe lid is a joke,"I just got this for a Christmas gift. I was excited to see how much better this carafe must be than the last Mr. Coffee thermal carafe I got, which has a few confusing elements; guests can never figure it out. I decided to test it with water first. I could barely get the water to come out. Was I missing something on how the lid operated? I tried the 800-line for help, but they were closed. I decided to check the Amazon reviews, and I'm glad I did. The thumb mechanism on the lid is a joke; I could barely get a dribble of water out using it. I had to take the lid off, as others have mentioned. What a hassle. This thing is going back in the box and back to where the well-meaning giver got it!"
1,"Nice looking, many flaws, poor value","We purchased this machine about 10 months ago. It looked nice on the counter and initially worked well. I would have given a four star review two weeks into the purchase. Now it is a one star. The ""metal"" on the front is actually plastic covered with metal looking foil like stuff. It began to crinkle and peel. The front plate also started turning green. So now it does not not even look good!As far as performance goes, the coffee was warm but never very hot even when we prewarm the carafe. We experienced some big spills and learned that you have to clean the o ring around the lid to keep it working. The pause and serve feature crapped out so now we are in the market for a new maker.I wish I would have spent my money on a maker that would last. I hate to be wasteful...financially and environmentally so I am disappointed in this product."
4,Maniac Magee,"Just Voice(This is written in the voice of the main character to convince you to read this book.)I thought this was a fantastic story of me, Jeffery Loniel ""Maniac"" Magee, being the star character. The author really shows throughout the story that I am very athletic, smart, and homeless. But being homeless didn't last long because I found a family, the Beales, who I could love and who could care for me. Through my days living with the Beales, I really got acquainted with the environment, being able to untie a cobbles knot, and to hit home runs off of the leading pitcher in strike outs. I still think blacks and whites should be together though, which this town doesn't seem to understand. The rest of the book deals with me running away again trying out many different families, but in the end I find my real home, to be with the Beales. I think people who like adventures and survival stories should read the book I am in, Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinneli."
2,ok,it was a good story in the beginning but then started to get boring. The characters were just like stick\s walking around going to places. it was not a fun book to read. i didn't enjoy it much. do not read it and read the book Hoot instead!
3,Review of the Maniac Magee,"Maniac Magee is a cool book,but doesn't have enough action.Still,I do like it due to the action it has now. If you want to read a good book then try Maniac Magee and learn about the events.It has rasicsm,death and mystery.And if you like legends you'll love Maniac Magee.But if I compare it to any Book of the Magic Tree House Series I Maniac Magee woudn't do any better."
5,The Maniac kid,I like the book Maniac magee because it was very intersting.It is also one of the best books I have ever read.That's why I think you should read Maniac magee By Jerry Spinelli.It's about a boy named Jeffery Lionel magee.He was an orphan at the age three.His parents died on a trian crash.He had to live with his gradma and grandpa.
3,Okay Book,"I read this book when I was 10, I think. I don't know, it just seemed a tad tedious. It was good but it felt like it would never end. It was quite confusing too, but I admit the story seemed interesting. I'm not sure I recommend it, but I'm not saying you shouldn't read it either."
5,hello land twelers and Mr. Maniac Magee,"As king of Atlantis I enjoyed this book very much but I do not know the meaning of how you say...running I have counseld whith my wisefish and we have decided that it is proble a for of transpertation. I commend him for not bein racial and for trying to teach others the same., very corages of him. and also for making freinds out of his enemys. and no we did not sink atlantis on purpouse.sinsirly malodokP.S. i'm not one i'll be 12,749,208 yr on june"
3,Great Adventure Book,I just finished Maniac Magee. The author is Jerry Spinelli. It made me realize how lucky I am to have a permenant home. If you like a good adventure book you'll like Maniac Magee. In this story Jeffery Magee runs away from home after his parents die in a car crash. He runs cross country in 51 days to the town of Two Mills where he gets the nickname Maniac. If you want to find out how he gets his nickname. You'll have to read Maniac Magee for your sellf.
5,A decidedly underrated classic,"I read this book when I was about 10 or 11, like many of the young people reviewing it here. I'm 17 now. The other night I found it in a box and decided to read it again - I breezed through it in a couple hours. What I noticed was that, unlike many books aimed at young adults, it had lost very little. It never seemed oversimplified, and many of its themes are as relevant and moving today as they were 7 years ago.The novel is beautifully written, combining sharp, concise prose with a sort of folk tale mentality that is extremely alluring and captivating. The characters are well-drawn and memorable, and their evolution is interesting. And all along there is plenty of action and excitement to keep the littler ones intrigued.Maniac Magee is truly a book that people of all ages can enjoy, and one I would recommend most highly to young adults."
1,maniac magee,Well i thought the book maniac magee was not a really good book. My teacher was reading the book to us in class. The begining sounded so boring it needed some more work. The book was not intersting to me so i just stopped paying attention. Over all rating I gave the book 1 star.
1,Maniac Mapee,"This book was so blaahh(...), to hard to understand and it wasn't enjoyable and so if ur reading this Im telling dont read the book its just a waist of ur time! I read the book and its so dissapointing!"
4,This book was good,"This book was quite intersting. The way he describes the life of ""MANIAC"" Magee is very good. I would recommend that young readers read this book."
4,runaway boy,I would have to say Maniac Magee is a pretty good book. Jerry Spinelli put some important subjects into this book. He also put some quotes in it that are very interesting and use words in creative ways. The plot is sometimes predictable but sometimes suspenseful. Maniac is a living legend and this book tells about his adventures as a runaway. He meets some interesting characters along the way. You would like this book if you like suspenseful stories.
3,What I thought about Maniac Magee!,Reviewer-Jessica(A 6TH GRADER) Jerry Spinelli uses his words in the most exciting way. When I read Maniac Magee I felt sad for Maniac. I like how Jerry really gets into the story and you know he will always use great details. A lot of people are against other people that are a different color then thereselvs. I liked how Maniac did not care which color anyone was as long as you he liked someone it did not mattter to him which color they were. You can learn a good lesson from this book.I suggest you don't read this book unless tou like boring dragged out stories.
2,Too Slow for me.,This book wasn't the best. It was too slow at times. It did have some good parts but I wouldn't read it again.
5,I know Spinelli.,"Well, through his son, I do. He was my art teacher in middle school, and he got my books signed for me.Anyways...Good book. Don't let the made for TV movie fool you."
2,What do i think?,I do not really like Maniac Magee bc it is a BORING book if you aren thinking about reading or buying this book don't. It is a book that i HAD to read in Class but i would NEVER read it if i were you!!!!
5,Wow What A Book!,"Who would think an eleven year old would be able to run from Holisaysburg to Two Mills, well the people of Two Mills did. Two Mills wasn't really a town, with the haterd and segregation, people made the East End and the West End. The East End had the ""black people"", the West End had the ""white poeple"". Well things did change ...I read this book, and as a 12 year old reader, this was the best class book I ever read. Maniac Magee had many twists and turns and it taught me don't take your family for granted and also get to know the people before you believe your imagination. The author had a great writers craft and amazing wording. I recommend this book to any reader who wants a book that teaches them a lesson in life."
4,Manaic Magee is a good book about friendship.,Maniac Magee was a good book not great but good.I liked reading some parts because they were exicting.But you may have a different opinion.It's about a boy who lost his parents.On his journey he meets alot of people.I require this book to good readers.You will enjoy reading about this special boy Jeffery Lionel Magee.
1,misleading,This book is yet another example of the fanatical rantings of close minded neo-enviro-libertaria-cons. Maniac Mcgee represents the United States constant 'struggle' to overcome 'facism' in the 'UN'.PleaseNone of the useless rantings of this book deserve any real attention.
1,"I wasn't such a ""Maniac"" Over this book","Maniac Magee was a good book but out of the 160 pages or so about 20-25 was deatails. I think he did use creative words though. If he didn't spend so much time describing everything then I think a lot more people would have liked the book. Though a few parts of the book that I read I thought were cool but he has too much deatail. He could have made the plot better and the story longer and kept the same amount of detail and I would have loved the story. Though I would highly suggest the story to little kids, people who love detailed stories, or parents. If I had some more time to read this book then i might have liked it better (one sign this a book the schools read which makes it a good book). Well thats my opinion and some others may agree with it and some may not.-Bastion T. DarkBlade"
3,Ehh,It could be a lot worse but if you like a good story about A Caucasian and African Americans getting along this is your story I cant give away the ending but I will say it has a great ending but everything in the middle is extremely dragged on. Overall a decent book for young adults.
3,My Review for maniac magee,"I liked the book. The author Jerry Spinelli, gets Maniac involved with a lot of differant people. Spinelli lets us picture the characters for ourselves. Sometimes he makes us laugh, somrtimes he makes us cry."
4,It was a good book but it had a good and some bab tkhings it,Jefery was a good character in this story. The west side didn't like mania because he was from the east side. The east side didn't like him baecause they though he was from the west side.Timmothy didn't like him because he was good at everything.I like it when he stop the two boys from running away from home. He made them a deel if they stayed in school that he would tell them the way to Texas. Bring the black boy to the party for the two boys. Winning all the you can eat pizza for the rest of his life. Not being mean to both sides of the black and the white.Magee living with the black.Being friends with the poor.
3,Good but too much enphasis on cultural differences.,"My students seem to enjoy this book more than I did, which is okay since it's kids Spinelli was trying to reach. I thought the book tried too hard to show how unfairly people of 'color' are treated. It became preachy to the point I was hoping the book would soon be over. The idea was fresh, but the presentation didn't quite make it interesting."
2,Uh...no...,"Right...well, I suppose you could say I didn't fully understand the point of this book. A little boy's parents die, he has to live with his feuding Aunt and Uncle and then he runs away one day. When he finds a place to live he runs away. The book is about a boy running for no reason....right...as I said I didn't fully understand the point."
4,Maniac Magee,"Maniac MageeManiac Magee is a average boy, who lives with his average parents , in an average town. But one day, that all changed when Maniac's parents die . Running faster and jumping higher than all the other kid Maniac becomes a legend. His adventures take him places you would never imagine."
2,I wasn't crazy over Maniac Magee,"The book Maniac was okay, although it was confusing. This was because the book would start to talk about the Pickwells then skip right over to the Beales. Also because there were so many charecters I couldn't keep track of them all. I thuoght Maniac Magee was boring. This is that it always led from one problem to the next. For example, first Russel and Piper are stealing then he beats Mars Bar in a race. There is never a time with no problems for Maniac. This book was good because it left you thinking what was going to happen next. But it gave you an idea of what would happen. It was almost like a cliff hanger, but it would come back to the problem later on in the book. That is what I think of the book Maniac Magee."
1,Maniac Magee,"Maniac Magee was a very bad book.I did not like it because it confused me.He was alawys running from place to place. I never knew where he was until he left.This story was not realistic For example whene Maniac ate dinner with the Pickwells,nobody said anything thoughout the whole dinner.The dinner was boring because nothing happend. This story was very pridictable. For example Maniac won the race with Marsbar.I think Maniac should of lost to Marsbar,then the story would of been more unpredictable.This was the worst book I have ever read."
1,The Most Deatailed Boring Story I've Ever Read,"Maniac Magee was a good book buyt out of the 160 pages or so about 20-25 was deatails. I think he did use creative words though. If he didn't spend so much time describing everything then I think a lot more people would have liked the book. Though a few parts of the book that I read I thought were cool but he has too much deatail. He could have made the plot better and the story longer and kept the same amount of detail and I would have loved the story. Though I would highly suggest the story to little kids, people who love detailed stories, or parents. If I had some more time to read this book then i might have liked it better (one sign this a book the schools read which makes it a good book). Well thats my opinion and some others may agree with it and some may not."
4,Great book for both beginning and advanced web graphics.,"Overall a great book. Worth the money alone with all the great web sites he gives for graphic discovery, graphic reductions and graphic creations. Includes numerous how to's that are great for the beginner but can probably be ignored by the advanced web person. Only drawback is that this book is made mainly for Windows and all the how-to's are based on Windows. Provides common sense explanations for confusing topics and buzzwords. I would recommend this book to anyone with interest in this field but be prepared to ignore 25% of the pages if you are an advanced Web designer."
3,Just what I expected after reading other reviews,"This is my least favorite of the modern NFS series. From what I understand, the next game out in the series will be going back to their origional roots bringing it back to city driving. The graphics are good and the new machine will help in the future games."
4,Atleast it was cheap,"I think I have to agree with a few of the other reviewers already on here with out a free roam option it just isn't as fun. But being able custimize a bunch of new cars is kinda fun for a while. All in all I'm glad i waited for a while before buying this since it's definitely not worth more then the $20 I paid, maybe not even that much."
2,Not worth it,"I got this book because the title was intriguing. I would have been happy with good personal anecdotes, art history, art criticism or just some good writing, but none of the above was to be found. I'm a Willem de Kooning fan and have read a bit about him and Jackson Pollack too. This book starts off with boring historical stuff about Long Island which I skimmed and then the parts about de Kooning and Pollack are rehashes about well known topics. The writing isn't very interesting and there isn't much about the artwork. The third person writing format is awkward too; lots of ""he's"" where it's hard to tell who ""he"" is. I'd say anyone who's interested in de Kooning should get ""de Kooning : An American Master"" by Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan, which is an excellent book."
3,Disappointing maps!,"If you are looking for detailed maps of the Roman Empire you will be disappointed. Only the major towns are listed, a far cry from the thousands that existed. The book is really not a map book but more of a reference book. There are a few maps but the majority of the book is written material with the addition of some nice pictures. For die hard history buffs like myself I would instead recommend the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World (ISBN 069103169X)."
5,Incredible resource for bible study,This is an incredible study bible. Highly recommended in the NASB or NKJV.
4,good snare drumhead,"is a really good item,it sounds awesome for mainstream and metal just tune it good and i usually put a pair of socks in my snare drum to get that sound so perfect that is not enough"
2,Haphazard,The author doesn't stay true to her characters. The plot may have been a good one but she's telling to many stories in one book and no one stays true to their character. What is anyone's motivation! Only the criminals make sense.
5,i'm experiencing withdraw,"All i can say is: PLEASE WIRTE ANOTHER ONE!!! I need to know what happens between Marcus & Jessica! I loved the first one, I was obsessed with the second one, and I can not get anough of the third. I can only hope Meghan Mccafferty is in the midst of continuing Jessica Darling's journey with Marcus."
3,let down...,"This book was far from being as good as the first two. It had it's high points but I really missed Marcus and it seemed like he was a different person. As did Jessica, it was almost like reading about two new characters. The beginning and end were good though... I was just a little let down with the middle."
1,ugh..,"It is nothing like the first or second! It took me forever to finish and im not even picky, ill read just about anything. At times it is really distasteful. And I felt like she was very out of character. I wish i hadn't bought it, i guess i'll sell it."
4,very nice for the money,"These earrings are very lovely, topaz has good color. received a lot of complements at work. good buy for the money."
4,Great Gift,i gave this to my mother as a gift and she absolutely loves it. she wears these almost all the time and has gotten many compliments. for this price they're definitely worth it.
5,Deitel books are the best,"Everyone that thought they knew anything about PERL told me to by the Llama and the Camel books (well respected O'Reilly books), which I did. I was disappointed with them as there was too much text and not enough programming examples.I then discovered there was a Deitel book on PERL. I should have checked for that first as I have two other Deitel books and love them. This was way better than the Llama or Camel book. There are many programming examples and they are all in the context of a complete working program or several html and PERL files. That is exactly what I was looking for - examples, working code, complete programs, and not too much talk.I think the Llama and Camel books are for people with more patience. I do think the Camel book would be a good resource for more advanced programming."
3,Hardly Worth Your Time,"When non-submariners try to write stories about submarine operations without expert help, inevitably the work fall short. In this book, there were a number of technical glitches, such as using ""breach"" instead of ""broach"" to describe exposure of the submarine above the surface when technically in a submerged state. The WWII operations of the USS Batfish are well enough written to hold the reader's interest, however, particularly those on her sixth patrol. The remainder of the book, almost half, is devoted to the story of getting the retired submarine to a land-locked park in Oklahoma. While this story may be of interest to anyone contemplating a similar acquisition of a government war trophy, it detracts from the main tale of the boat's wartime adventures. A much more exciting and authentic tale may be found in Eugene Fluckey's ""Thunder Below""."
3,Ehhhh...it's OKAY...,"Not my favorite punk album, but it'll do. The only song that I can tolerate to listen to on the CD is ""I Love Living in the City"". I'll just stick to Dropkick Murphys."
1,This is the best that LA punk had to offer?,"It has been said that after X and Black Flag, Fear was the best band during LA's brief punk heyday of 1980-1982. If so, no wonder the genre died an unmornful death. The tragedy is that Fear sounded like they had enough talent and ideas to overcome whatever punk stereotyping the record industry insisted on manifesting. THE RECORD starts out promising enough with Let's Have A War, Beef Baloney, and Camarillo but then descends into brainless, potty mouth hackery that gave this music a bad name. Between this record and their performance in The Decline Of Western Civilization, it appears that Fear was just another bunch of talentless charletrans who were only in it for the money. The great rock and roll swindle indeed. Not Recomended."
2,Network Media Drive,"I have had this Router for about a year. There were no problems, but neither am I impressed by the speed. In the last two weeks, I tried to add, first a WD Network Drive and then a IOmega Media Network Drive. I had extensive contact with WD, IOmega and Netgar Tech Support, but none was able to resolve the incompatibality between these network drives and the router. This is past technology.I am now buying a Cisco E 3000 with USB for attaching a external drive and hopefully this will resolve my issue."
1,"POS, 2 dead in less than a year","Setup wasn't great, but not terrible. I have had two die on me in less than a year. Indian tech support guys are the politest people on earth, but not very helpful. The last Netgear router I had before those two died on me after a year too. A waste of a lot of time and money."
2,Stinks,"My WNR834Bv2 was 3 years old, then it just died. All lights quit, no power, no work. Nothing I tried could revive the thing. Not worth fixing. So I bought a new Belkin and found out that it downloads and works almost twice as fast on N."
1,"Hard to set up, works intermitantly Don't waste your money","I bought this product, thought it would work, it started to drop the wireless signal working for only 10 minutes at a time. It is hard to set up, the cd is useless, and the web interface is just as difficult. It has to reboot after each change to the settings, takes 30 minutes to enter what should take 10! Don't spend your money on this, buy a puppy, easier to take care of.Nick"
3,Seem to be some issues.,I bought this router to act as a wireless repeater. I already had a slightly better model of Netgear router for my home that I use for the Base. After going through all of the instructions to set it up as a repeater it constantly jams my wireless...basically shutting it down. I works great for a short period of time and then I need to reboot or nothing works.I'm sure it's a setting issue that isn't spelled out in the manual.I'll just have to keep trying when I have time...otherwise it'll stay unplugged.
3,NetGear WNR834B,Product is great but the seller didn't include the CD with is not that big of deal except I cant lock it and am not sure it even installed correctly. But still have Internet and a wireless signal.
4,Fossil Watch,"The watch arrived promptly and was in working order; however, I didn't really like the face of the watch. I'm keeping it because the shipping was very expensive, there's a 15% restocking fee, and I'd have to pay return shipping. Those costs almost total the price of the watch. For that reason, I won't order except directly from Amazon in the future. That way I'll get free shipping and no restocking fee."
4,Good Book,"Great book, Came on time although I'm so far away. Thanks for the good service! Will look to you for more purchases in the future."
3,Fast Read,"I read this after seeing the movie, both when I was very young. While I read on because of the plot -- I wanted to know everything that was being concealed -- I was aware that I was reading a page-turner, not great literature. I wonder if readers of today would/will find this book as ""sensational"" as readers of the 1950s and 1960s did."
4,"still relevant, still scandalous","I became interested in this book after viewing a documentary on the 1950s entitled ""Let's Play House."" The story seemed very intriguing, a stark contrast to the typical portrayals of the fifties seen on ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Ozzie and Harriet."" While this book is no literary classic, I found myself drawn into the lives of these characters. I wasn't sure this book would still be as shocking by 2004 standards, but I was surprised to find it still rings true. Obviously, it's not AS taboo as it would have been in its day, when people only mentioned it in hushed voices to their closest friends. The author clearly HAD something with this book. I was glad to curl up with it each night, and would recommend it to almost anyone, except perhaps some younger readers."
2,Absorbing but...terribly written,"I've read the existing reviews here and, yes, P.P. is a gripping and well-paced soap opera. Yes, it was revolutionary for its era.But, c'mon people...as writing, it stinks. The ersatz profundity of the opening paragraphs (""Ah, Indian Summer. She is a Lady"") is the worst kind of amateur creative-writing exercise. The sex-scene dialogue is so bad I exploded with laughter more than once.One example. Mike Rossi to Constance:""Your legs are absolutely wanton! Do you know it?""Let's keep this ""classic"" in perspective."
4,Peyton Place,I totaly enjoyed the book. If this book was considered sleazy the readers of then would want to die with thedifferent versions of sexual reading in this generation. Looking forward to read Return to Peyton Place.Thanks to Barbara Delinsky if not for her book I don't recall knowing this book existed. Even though my daughterseems to recall seeing the TV series or the movie recently on TV and she is only 23. As some readers commented this could very well be the small village where I grew up.
5,This book really helped me handle change better. Excellent.,"This is the best self-help book I've read in years. The first section addresses scores of different types of change that people may deal with, and provides tips for handling them. Then Mastering the Winds of Change covers twelve concrete, effective strategies for coping effectively with change and stress. What's particularly interesting and helpful are the real-life stories and tips from the forty peak performers the author interviewed. They include Walter Cronkite, Nobel prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Lillian Vernon, and many others. I've given the book to over 20 friends, and most of them liked it as much as I did. Reading this book really changed my life. Highly recommended"
5,This is squirrel proof so far!,"I purchased this item to go with my Droll Yankees Shepahards poleDroll Yankees SEP 68-Inch Shepherds Envy Pole with Hanging Arm(see my product review there on the link). This works very well with the Droll Yankees Pole systems. It attaches securly and easily. This is well made of very thick, sturdy plastic. SO far I have had mine for 2 months and although I have many squirrels, none have been able to make it past this squirrel guard. I highly recommend this with the Droll Ynakee pole system! I bought a second one to go on my other pole."
5,Princess Diana Concert!,"Amazon dot com is wrong, this is a 2 disc set! I ordered mine from MovieMars and they were fast shipping!My Discs have; The Diana Films, A series of films about the Princess Diana were shown to the crowd at Wembley Stadium and those watching around the world. They were a compelling testimony from people of all ages and walks of life to Diana's remarkable qualities. These Blu-ray disc's include all the films shown at the concert as well as additional films which have never previously been seen!Documentary; This Blu-ray includes a unique documentary about the making of Concert for Diana which never before interviews and backstage footage!The Blu-ray disc's are Audio Formats; Region All! Aspect Ratio:16:9. Plus the Subtitles are in English, German, Spanish, and Portuguese.Have a Great time watching this Concert for the Late Great Princess Diana! She is the the Queen of our Hearts!!God Bless,K. Ann"
5,The Best party of the decade !!,"I saw the concert on tv, really wonderful. Had to get a copy. The show is so diverse, there really has to be something for everybody."
4,Don't Miss This One,"My advice is to purchase anything associated with Carl Johns...from his psychedelic country band NoahJohn to his collaboration with Eugene Chadbourne (Country Protest Anew) to Charlemagne--his dreamy, lo-fi indie pop band."
2,Wish it were easier to use,"I needed this for a training class focused on Excel Modeling while I was running Win 7 on my Mac......Pros:1) Flexibility and Compactness2) Pretty much Spill proofCons:1) Some of the buttons don't respond as quickly as you would like them to, requiring a bit of ""button mashing"".2) Buttons are hard to get use to it's layout as its not entirely setup like a Win XP Keyboard.Needless to say, I started bringing in a traditional windows keyboard to class. I will only use this keyboard sparingly."
4,Levinas' way of reading Talmud,Rabbi Stone gives a short introduction to Levinas' work that becomes increasingly popular even in North America. Levinas is not easy to read and to understand yet is ethical philosophy is fascinating and can easily be compared to Martin Buber. But Levinas was also a Talmud scholar and his way of reading and expounding Talmud is interesting especially for contemporary Jews. Ira Stone explains the way in which Levinas uses Talmudic sources and gives examples from selected sugyot where he applies that technique.
3,A Good Connector,"These Habitrail connectors do a good job and are compatible with the Crittertrail products, which is good. However, my dwarf was extremely small even for a dwarf, and these connectors seemed too small for her to get through. She did get through, but barely."
1,a lame attempt to jump on the GRK publicity bandwagon,"in reality, keppel was at best tangential to the hunt for the green river killer. this book comes across as nothing more than a self-aggrandizing attempt to milk some personal publicity out of a horrific murder case. those expecting for details about the search that ultimately led to the arrest of gary ridgway will likely be disappointed. those interested in ted bundy or bob keppel will fare better. sadly, i was not one of those readers. the title is misleading, and i was one of those suckered in. oh well. one star it is."
3,Anyone... anyone... Bueller?,"I have two S&S sets, Contracts and Torts. The difference is night and day. The Torts CDs are dare I say it... fun! The Contracts CDs are sooo dry and boring as to make them almost unlistenable. It's almost like listening to someone read from a textbook. I gave it 3 stars because some people might be looking for that type of ""just give me the facts"" approach. But my preference is for an entertaining listen that makes the CDs fun and memorable. You will NOT find that here."
4,read most of the series and i enjoyed it very much,enjoy reading it very much. i have most of the series and found myself wanting more. Worth the read.will probably read again..
3,It was ok,"This is the third in the series. It was ok. By far my favorite in the series was the second book. Need to read them in order, but I would recommend it."
5,READ IT!,This book is AWESOME! I enjoyed the entire series and gladly recommend it for readers of ANY age. Good clean story.
5,"Very nice textbook, if a bit dense","This definitely fits the bill as far as ""intermediate"" goes. All of the instruction is in Japanese, so if you are a beginner, don't pick this up. I bought this to use in my ""Kanji III"" class at the Japan Society in NYC, which is the most advanced kanji-specific class that is offered. The chapters that we have concentrated on in class were organized pretty nicely, and definitely gave me a better grasp on things like onyomi and kunyomi as well as verbs created from kanji compounds. Unfortunately the class that I am taking meets only once a week, and I've been pretty busy, so I haven't gotten as much out of this book as I would have liked to date - however, the setup of the book seems like it's pretty decently organized for self-study, so I hope to work on it a bit more in my free time."
5,Only for the series student of Biblical History,"This book I doubt will be in the hands of the average person. I bought it out of an interest of having actual photos of ancient Hebrew manuscripts, and I was not disappointed. This book is mostly for the scholarly inclined since it deals with the type set of the Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus Scroll found in the Dead Sea area. There is an analysis of the writing style as well as some technical linguistic areas. As I mentioned before this book is mainly for the series Biblical scholar."
3,A bit disappointing,Having read other books by Pears I found this one a bit trite. His characters need more filling out but I like his sotry line and the incorporation of great art with mystery/crime plots.
5,Little wonder!,"This little stylus is the handiest thing ever. Slips right into your ear jack and is right at your fingertips anytime you need it. Especially helpful for those of us with fuddle-fingers. I wish the ""barrel"" were just a tad longer but the size doesn't impede the use of this product at all. Recommended for anyone!"
1,Uninteresting and Boring,"The cover photo on the DVD case is completely misleading. You will not see anything like this on the video itself. The entire video consists of a variety of girls just standing around, usually at the beach or in the shower. Sometimes they dance a little. Everything is set to music. But the girls always have on bikinis or bathing suits and they never show anything. The video has no dialogue and no plot. Just girls standing around. And the girls are featured one at a time, so there is no interaction between any of them. If you want to see something that is arousing and entertaining, you would be much better off getting a ""Girls Gone Wild"" DVD. As my title says, this DVD is uninteresting and boring. Not recommended. And definitely not worth the price you'll pay."
2,Incorrect description and terrible support and product,"There are NOT two pens...only one with some additional points. It does work with the INK software.The OCR software is not as described above, it is MyScript. Further, this software requires a key code to activate. This IS NOT PROVIDED. The documentation is only about 3 pages, and no information is given on this software at all.Back it goes! Quickly!!"
3,smells similar to bulgari black..,Can't lie smells a lot like bulgari black. Not sure how i feel about the cologne yet. Just got it today. I have to try it out on a night on the town and see how I fare with it.update - I have changed my mind this is sexy. Since I suffer from allergies this took some getting used to. Im not saying it bothers my nostrils but when my allergies flare up it's hard for me to smell anything. But anyway I wore it today and it's sexy !! This is probably in my top 3 now. It's a nice fresh sexy scent.My #1 is Versace Aux Fraische2. Burberry Touch (now)3. Issey Miyake - nightime or going out (classic)
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE,"I happened to know about colognes a great deal,... and I have conducted a teston this item and it proved to be fake,.... the odor does not last long (not enough oil base), in fact it smells even differenti bought the original one from the mall and you can't compare both; the one from the mall has a scent that lasts much much longer and is very strong, this product has watery texture. I'm 100% convinced in my conclusion that this product is not the real Burberry made."
1,Ripped Off,I ordered this movie awhile back ago in early October and when I finally got it kn the mail. I played the VHS and it totally had another cartoon recorded over the Halloween Tree. Ive been wanting to see this cartoon movie since my childhood but this sucks!!! It comes to show that peopl out there still rip off good people. So be very careful who you order from.
5,Great Halloween Movie,"This is one of my kids favorite Halloween movies. It doesn't come on TV as much as it used to, so I ordered this for our movie collection."
2,"OK, but...",There is no comparison between this film and the book. The original story and prose of the book is lost in this translation to film. It seems this film is aimed at a younger audience than the original bookRead the book.
4,;0),This is a fun movie to watch I remember seeing it for the first time in the 90s and I watched it today and still laugh. It's about of people sent to traffic school for their poor driving and has to pass the course. Good fun.I didn't know John Murry the star is related to Bill Murry thought he look familiar.
3,TRAFFIC SCHOOL AT IT'S BEST,"Great movie. As someone who works in the traffic school industry I laughed out loud. (You have to be able to laugh at yourself) John Murray must have a hard time living in his brother Bill's shadow, but this movie definitely shows he's got his own chops.Matthttp://www.BESTtrafficschool.com"
4,Nice everyday use glasses,Love them for everyday use...appropriate sizes for different purposes! Try it if you want to spend economically for average quality glasses.
2,Stupid,"The biggest problem with this so-called mystery is that there is no mystery. From the beginning you realize that there is only one possible murderer. Fonda is quite good, however. Her performance does not come across as methodical as in other movies. Still, I wouldn't buy this video."
1,simply useless + backhanded advertising,"i am sorry to say that this turned out to be a completely useless purchase, containing very limited information.the content may serve the absolute beginner for maybe a few weeks - anyone searching for true information - for instance on such simple questions as how to authorize an ipod on several computers - is left in the dark. on top of that, 1/4th of the book is filled with additional purchase suggestions ('toys for your ipod'). not surprisingly, most of the index is also taken up by these 'accessories'.unless you are looking for only the most basic information, save your money and go for another - any other! - guide. this book will become a dustcollector in no time; instead, the internet is a much better source...this book is a waste of paper - let alone the energy it took to be produced."
2,Not much new here....,"Tarzan and the Forbidden City has all the usual elements of the formula: cruel villians, some comedy, lovely heroines, and threatening wild beasts. The first half of the book was better than average pulp adventure. Here, the pace moved quickly; the story's main conflicts emerged in the midst of Burrough's evocative depictions of the threatening and unknown regions of the African jungle. However, towards the end, the tension bogs down into a series of relentless and wild action sequences where cliffhanger follows upon cliffhanger, stretching the bounds of plausibility, even for a Tarzan story."
5,michael jackson w/out the silly dancing,"Nicky thomas flies under the radar in the reggae world and that just ain't right. The american influence is strong, considering some of the songs he covers (tell it like it is, rainy night in georgia) that's to be expected, but it's definitely rocksteady on par with toots and alton ellis easily, with tons of soul. Nicky thomas would be the prince of pop if he was still around today, i'm sure."
4,Quick and to the point,"Another great resource from Glade B. Curtis. The same information in the [book:Your Baby's First Year: Week By Week (Your Pregnancy Series), Second Edition|865664] but in a fabulous compact version. I did feel that the authors lean toward formula feeding over breastfeeding in the subtleties that they expressed, but the information for either beginning feeding of an infant is there. I enjoy the resources provided in the books from the Your Pregnancy series and I highly recommend them."
1,Mind blowing?,"If by ""mind blowing"" other reviewers meant that this book will make your brain want to spew chunks because it is so bad, then yes. It is mind blowing.There is nothing unearthly, mystical, or genius about this little book. It is a collection of posturings and pseudo-poetic drivel.There is no great imagery or prose in it. Just self-conscious phrases attempting to sound cool by being nearly completely obscure.The book isn't worth the calories wasted by the act of picking it up."
3,A Walking Tour On The Wild Side,"The main draw of this book for me is Palahniuk's ""postcards"", his one to two page long memories scattered throughout the book. These are models of economy, which immediately grab the reader's interest and have lots of little surprises (not all of them pleasant). Especially hilarious are his tales of his role in an MTV video, and of a protest stunt by anarchists that ended up looking like a protest against Italy. (Sorry to be vague, but it defies summary.)The rest of the book is a altie travel guide of the _Lonely Planet_ backroads style. Sights range from the scenic to the seedy, emphasis on the off-beat, though there is a welcome, and unexpected, chapter on the city's gardens.His affection for his town shines through most every passage of every section. There may not be much left of the frontier, which a century and a half ago prompted Thoreau to say ""I must walk toward Oregon, and not toward Europe"", but what's left is wild enough, and still distinctively American."
4,Excellent book but not for a `crash course',The top researchers in the field give this (by now) legendary compiler book. Crisp and stimulating discussions of the various phases of compilers. A major disadvantage is that examples & exercises are few. While reading the stuff on LALR parsers for the first time one feels woefully lost.... serious stuff intended for careful study - not just another book for perusal.
4,"Good overall, but not for people with small heads.",This is a good headband. It's light and comfortable. I was expecting it to have more stretch though. I would not recommend this product to someone with a small head. I have a small head and when I wear this during my runs it often slips down my forehead or slips down the back of my hair. I still chose to wear it over nothing though.
2,Price,"I purchased one for myself to try out then another for my wife. They are better than a terry cloth band but very, very expensive for the utility you get from them. We use them for biking and they do fit under a helmit very well but for yard work they are just slightly better than our old workout headbands. My low score on this product is mainly on the price and the high freight charge, other wise they seem to be a good product."
4,I keep revisiting,"I heard bits from this album on a quicky review after 'Fresh Air' on NPR. I bought it, gave a quick listen and put it to the side. I find myself repeatedly throwing some of these songs in many months later and really enjoying them. Their subtleties in the designs of the songs gives me a little of the goosebumps on the back of my neck. Little strummy sounds hear and there, put in on purpose, damping cuts on the strumming at particular choosen spots...it's very interesting! The quality of the recording is delicious too! They're a different styles of recording through the album, I think 'feel' three...the most obviously different style is the first cut, sounds like completely different equipment. OKay, enough of the technical, what about the music? Acoustic, driven, subtle 5th harmonies, cool lyrics, cello here and there, many rythms driven by the strumming sound which I really like, just listen to it!"
4,"Not the best of their albums, but a really great work!","When I first played Quiet is the New Loud for a dance-loving friend, I had to admonish her. ""You do not groove to Kings of Convenience; you listen to them and have sad sex or receive your last rites."" Though I meant this as a huge compliment to the earnest sounds of the Norwegian duo, the same cannot be said of Riot on an Empty Street. The new album does beautifully echo their former melancholy in many places, but this album also displays many moments of emotional strength. I think of the album's collective mood as one of a person in transition, trying to make sense of some long passed disaster after the numbness and horror have faded. Naturally the process of repair will be an effort, but there's the aural suggestion that a change for the better is coming. Excellent, excellent work."
5,Very nice,"These compression socks are very comfortable, they fit great, are a good quality and nice texture, I highly recommend them!"
4,"Good Pictures, but no really early users","This book is really GREAT, but there is hardly any mention of the first users of the airplane, especially the DC-8 section. the rest of the book is very good."
2,No Key Code,I know sacred is a fun game but this dvd didnt contain a key code. You have to have a a keycode for sacred and sacred underworld to play this game on multiplayer!Where is my key code???
1,Customer Service,"The game in itself is entertaining, however it did not come with CD keys, nor can they be found on the CD's, they are necessary to play in the multiplayer mode. I have written various emails to Ascaron, the makers of the game, in order to solve the problem, however help and/or solutions have been non-existent. Reccomendation: If you want to play multiplayer, look for a different game."
3,"back in the day it would have rocked, but...","Bought this game cause I needed something easy to play and it does the job. Simple point and click, hack and slash fest. The feel isn't as good as Titan Quest but I guess it's because the game is a few years older. I like the combo system and the combat arts.overall it's a fun game to play but if you've been exposed to more recent hack and slash games then this one may put you off a little, since the feel isn't as smooth."
5,Incredible,"This film is so devisive - I have not found two people that agree 100% and that is what makes it great. I find it strange when people say it wants to be ""Heathers"" or ""Election""I have read a few interviews with the writer and the director and i think they just made an independent film that no studio would make. Pretty Persuaion made me think, it made me mad, it made me laugh, and it made me cry. So many films these days are forgetable. This is one that sits with you for a long time. I highly recommend it!"
5,dvd storage solution,"My purchase of the Sony DVPCX995V 400-disk dvd changer from Amazon make a total of 3 Sony 400-disk changers that I own. The other 2 still work like new. I would recomend this to anyone that likes movies, and did to one of my bestfriends. He and his brother both bought one, and love it. Now some of the negative things that you'll see in other reviews.1. That it's too bulky- Yes its a large player, but remember that it holds 400 disks.2. That the load time to play a disk is to slow- It is slower then single disk players, but once again it holds 400 not 1.3. That the DVD title do not load on most disks- Yes this is true, BUT that is the disk manufacture's fault not Sony's. The player can not read something that is not on the disk.Well I hope this helps you decide weather on not to buy this player."
4,"Finally a home for my 400 disc's, now what to do with the 401st..","Pros:- 400 disc's- Sorting discs by name, category, etc- No reason to ever leave the couch- Good quality pictureCons:- Labeling discs is a pain!!- DVD changes are a little slowConclusion:This DVD player changed our lives. No more changing kid's DVD's every single day, no more looking for a certain disc, no more scratches.If you have a big collection, a big changer is a must. I only wish the DVD labeling was faster and could work with a wireless keyboard."
4,Sony Multi DVD Changer,"The unit works well. Did not find many DVD's that automatically put the information into the menu. I had to do this manually with a keyboard. A couple of the DVD's information were deleted from the menu for some reason. I haven't figured that one out yet. All in all, the picture is great and the ease of use is good."
1,BUYER BEWARE! It ruins your DVD collection!,"I've had mine for a couple of years.... Loved it until recently I realized it scratched over 40 of my DVDs making them unplayable. What a nightmare.I bought this to keep my DVDs from gettting scratched - Ironically it ruined a good chunk of my collection.Sony Support would do nothing for me, except for ""Sorry"" and ""you can pay for a repair!I would advise you consider something else."
1,"Poor quality, it won't last",I originally purchased a DVP-CX985V Sony 400 disc player. It broke down after 2 years. Sony wanted $268 to repair it. I liked the 400 disc feature and thought the breakdown may have been a fluke so I decided to purchase this newer model....big mistake on my part. This one broke down 9 days prior to it's one year anniversay. I didn't even get a years use out of it. As much as I love the idea of a 400 disc player I would never purchase this product again. Save your money and take this as a fair warning if you do decide to purchase it.
2,"Good as a storage unit, mostly.","The reason I bought a 400 disk changer is that our house was destroyed in a fire, and the only disks that survived were in the sixty disk player inside the AV cabinet.So the 400 Disk Sony seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, after a year I finally filled the unit past slot 200 and found it wouldn't play any of the movies (brand new movies) in any slot above 200. I moved movies from lower slots to the non-playing slots and they wouldn't play. I found that if I took a new movie and put it in the higher slot and then moved it to the lower slots it wouldn't play, BRANDED!The repair/replacement deal I could do without, I advanced the theory that the unused slots were brand new and should be treated as in warranty, Sony didn't agree. After all, am I supposed to play a movie in all 400 slots when new to ensure they work?Last Sony product I ever buy."
2,"Great idea, poor execution!","I really believed that this would solve all my storage and put my DVD collection at my fingertips any time I wanted. I spent hours putting DVD's in the unit, 389 of them with just enough room to store a few more if I wanted, only to find that it wouldn't play a single DVD. It has some kind of feature that looks for copyright infringement of something and I have nothing but top dollar store bought DVD's that wouldn't play. I thought Sony was the top of the line so I purchased this with confidence. Wow, I was so wrong. I called for technical help and after 10 minutes of phone menu runaround, I ended up with a person unable to articulate in english and from Pakistan living in the Phillipines. The concept is fantastic, but they need to work on this to be a viable product. Glad to deal with Amazon and able to get a refund on a product not worthy of working at all. If you buy this unit I wish you all the best in getting it to work."
1,Changed My Mind,Wow I really wanted to buy this product but after reading the reviews I will not.Sony take note! You need to improve.I will look else where.
3,Not the Same group,This is a punk group...the Smut Peddlers that put out POorn Again is a Hip-Hop Group..they are not one and the same...please note this before you by the CD and are upset that its not Eon and Cage...toodles
1,Extremely Boring,"I rate this one star only because there are not negative stars. As another reviewer said there is no beginning, no middle, and no end. It is simply a rambling monologue with no plot or purpose; except to make money for the author. This was a gift so at least I did not spend the money; but it is a shame anyone did. I read it all the way through (which makes me more stupid than those that quit at half way), thinking it would get better; it did not."
1,Not worth one star.,"I read a lot and enjoy most everything I read, but not this book. I kept reading it thinking it had to get better, had to have some redeeming value. No. It doesn't. I finally quit half way through and I'm so glad I did."
1,Yawn,"This book is boring!!! I am the type of person who reads to be enthralled, not bored. Interested, not confused. This book is short but a very hard read. Something I would expect to encounter in a college class, not something to read for fun. It took me a month to finish this book, and I am a fast reader. This year I am reading through the past pulitzer winners, and this has been the worst so far. My favorite ""Empire Falls"". I finished that book in 2 days. If you want a well written and interesting read, I would recommend that book. Dont read this unless you want to fall asleep or spend 10 minutes on a well-written but confusing sentence."
2,Couldn't get into it...,I did not get past the first fifty pages. The lack of plot and structure did not appeal to me.
3,MIXED FEELINGS,"After a strong start that aroused empathy in the reader, this book seemed disorganized. Rambling through history, theology, personal experience, confession, romance, etc., the shape of the book left something to be desired. The connectors were missing that would have added to cohesion. On the other hand, the author was able to get into the skin of the speaker. She seemed to have embodied all aspects of the protagonist's character, which was an admirable feat. I have heard that the author's first book was a hit. After this experience, however, I might not want to try her again."
4,Among the Best of Modern American Literature,"I am not usually one for slow paced novels. Especially ones about the trials and tribulations of a small town mid-western preacher. But Gilead is different. This is one of the best constructed and most beautifully written novels I have ever read. Characters come into focus through small details and moments that make up everyday life, and by the end, I was reading this like a page turning thriller; staying up late into the night to find out what happens to the characters.If you want to see the best that modern American fiction has to offer, I highly recommend Robinson and Gilead."
2,Disappointing,"For starters, the book lacks a true male perspective. And it's more a religious tract than novel. This is not a Pulitzer Prize work. Character development is hampered by excessive religiousity. Very disappointed."
3,A slow read,"As many reviewers have mentioned, ""Gilead"" is a slow developing book. Unfortunately, the pay-off at the end that many other reviewers also mentioned didn't happen for me. Call me dull or anti-intellectual, but there is very little to recommend in this book IMO. Granted, the premise is that a dying preacher (John Ames) wants to leave his son the history of his family (""his begats""), so naturally Robinson's narrative falls into a pattern of short recollections that are interspersed with Ames's impending doom. For me, the book didn't really go anywhere and Robinson's writing, though poetic in spots, wasn't overly aesthetic. Still wondering how it won the Pulitzer."
2,"excruciating for some, love affair for others","This book seems to have a very specific group of readers who really love it. I'm not one of them. It took me over 50 pages to even get into the odd rhythm of the prose. I stuck it out for another 50 pages because it was the book for my literature group and they all get 100 pages before I give up. By that point, I still hadn't found anything appealing about it and I quit. Of my book group 2 women adored it and 1 other couldn't stand it. This is a book for the abstract person, not for very literal thinkers."
5,"God, the F(f)ather and the S(s)on","Read this book it's really good. It resonated with me as a dad (even though my son is only [...]). Its easy to read and hard to put down even though the issues covered are complicated. The way it's written gave me the time I needed to grasp them.A good book about the Good Book, the Father and the Son and fathers and sons."
2,Sentimental and boring.,"I guess the title says it all. I liked the writing style. However, this is probably one of the most boring books I have ever read. I couldn't even finish it. So maybe it picks up in the second half. I will never know and have no interest in finding out."
2,Pulitizer Prize?? You gotta be kidding,"I started this book thinking wow...here is a ""Shipping News"" all over again..but after a numbingly 100 pages, ( I did finish it) I realized that I had been tricked into reading an exhausting chick book written by a preacher wannabe. No plot to speak of, albiet some beautiful phrasing but borrrrrring!"
2,"I'd like to love it, but I was bored","The novel is written beautifully, but I was waiting and waiting for something to happen. This is like some of the novels and short stories I had to read when I was in undergrad where I can clearly see the literary merit, but the story is really lacking for me. I'm glad I read it, but I won't re-read it."
3,"Been there, done that.","This book was recommended by a friend 43 years my junior. To her, it was worth reading again. I started it, but soon realized it was much like letters I wrote over the years and, had I kept a diary (the military frowned on that) it'd be much the same..My friend, however, certainly would give it five stars. Thus my suggestion is that if you're 50 or less, likely you will enjoy it."
2,A Disappointment,"I was eager to read ""Gilead"" based on the positive reviews and the Pulitizer Prize. Admittedly, the writing is beautiful, and there are some profound thoughts the author shares. But the book is boring, lacks plot, and for all the writing, lacks important characterization. For example, it is obvious that Ames' wife is younger and uneducated. But we don't know where she is from, or how she got to Gilead. Rather than leaving the reader hungry for more, the slo-o-ow pace and lack of pertinent information about the characters just left me frustrated. The author also over-used some of the better images, such as the ""communion"" that Ames received from his father. The image was interesting the first time, but Ames then references it again-and again-and again. It was less a novel than the musings of the character. A disappointment from what is obviously a good writer."
2,Didn't do anything for me,"As others have pointed out, Gilead is essentially a long letter from John Ames, a minister in his 70s and near the end of his life, to his young son. There's really not much more to it than that. Very little happens, and while it appeared to me that the point of the book must be some kind of spiritual journey for Ames, there really isn't a coherent spiritual journey either; it's mainly just Ames rambling from one subject to another without making any real discoveries. Not only is there no resolution, there's really nothing to resolve in the first place. I thought about giving up on this book several times because it is a slow, arduous read, but I stuck it out just in case something significant happened later in the book. Unfortunately it did not, and I have to say I was quite disappointed. Others obviously disagree though, so take my review for what it's worth."
5,Prosetry,"There's a small-minded, rigid part of me that wants writers to commit either to poetry or prose, and stop trying to do both at the same time. Christopher Kennedy's book amply demonstrates how wrong I am. Here is why the form exists, and how it should look when it's good. Kennedy has found and mapped new territory in the world, and in my own head. The title piece, Nietzsche's Horse, is one of the most powerful, lucid, and memorable poems I've ever read, in any form. I stand corrected, and happily so."
5,Good CD,"Very good production, very serious subject matter with great storytelling. Anything The Pros are affiliated with you can bet will be the bomb and this album is just that. Thanks Mr. J!"
4,Very reflective,I would order at least one size larger than you would normally wear to get enough girth to cover you!
5,"If you like the Buddha Bar series, you'll love this","If you enjoy downtempo dub, jazz, and latin downtempo, you'll enjoy this disc. I picked it up on a whim, and was plesantly surprised. I especially enjoyed the 6th track (O Que Sera - A Flor Da Pele), a nice quiet beat with a soft piano.-C"
5,Christian Churches of America: Origins and Beliefs,"This is one of the finest and most easily digestible introductions to the major Christian denominations of America that I have ever read. Backman comes as close to an unbiased look at the wonderful diversity of American Christianity as any human could. This is a book that is invaluable for scholars, celrgy, and lay-persons alike. His style is wonderfully readable and he does not overburden the reader with inaccesible language or inordinate speculation. A must for any student of modern Christianity."
4,FIFA 08,"It's a fun game. There are features that EA took out way back in 04-05 that I still miss. The controls are still a bit ""touchy"" (i.e. who runs away from the ball when it's passed directly to you????). Glitches aside, I bought this for fun, and that's what I've gotten out of it. The ""Be a Pro"" mode is by far the best part of the game. The online version of Be A Pro is easily worth the price of admission, provided you don't get stuck with a bunch of idiots online.I think the menus need to be thought out a bit better, as sometimes it's hard to find options. I've played FIFA 07 and this is easily better. I haven't tried 09 yet, but heard it's not as good as 08.Hopefully EA will make something worthy of 5 stars. In my opinion, they haven't done it yet, but are getting closer."
4,Fifa 08 review,"The game is overall what i expected and more, it has many more features then fifa 06 and 07, also the game play is quite different, it is a little more realistic and slower game play as well. HDTV looks great and the colors are excellent. also a big plus is the challenge mode, it willl keep you entertained, same thing with be a pro modeoverall great buy, its worth the money"
3,I've always liked this book...,"I've always liked this book. I have probably read it at least a half dozen times; however, it had been several years since the last time that I have read it. I have always like Garwood as an author. She is a very engaging story teller (although there were a few inconsistencies that bothered me - a daughter of a baronet is not called a lady [I believe] and a Native person with a full-blood grandparent is a quarterblood not a halfblood).The story line appeals to me as I enjoy the mixing of English nobility with the wild, west of America. I believe that Lucas is a great character and I found myself enjoying the interactions between him and the children. There were times, though, which I found Taylor to be quite annoying and I regret that Madame wasn't in the book more! As another poster stated, I had expected a grand show-down with the evil uncle but the book ended with a whimper."
3,okay book but no zing,I liked this book but it didn't have that special something that most of Julie Garwoods books have
5,Absolutely Great!,"I have read this book when i was in grade six, and have loved it until this very day! (grade 9) I have never been so interested in a story before, I think, to me , this was the first book that opened me to a whole selection of others. I will never forget this book, I strongly recommand it to anybody, this book is absolutley geat.With understandable characters, humurous and realistic, a book every girl growing up can relate to.My enclosing sentence, I have none, it is simply marvelous."
5,dam good movie,this movie is so dam good i been waiting for ever for it get to dvd wow what a movie the best one hulk's ever done thanks roy
5,About freaking time,"I love this movie. I know Hogan is pretty much considered a douche now but back then, he was the most well known wrestler in the world and this movie was no exception. Even if the acting isn't the best, it's still just one of the few wrestling movies that came out during the 80's when it was starting to boom, the other one if anyone remembers called Body Slam is alittle less known. Zeus not to mention was one intimidating SOB. One of my favorite parts is when Hogan er RIP was in the limo and trying to get out until he jumps onto the roof after because of the power of RIPamania explodes first. I have a digital copy I bought that came out terrible so here we are after over 20 years, Hogan's only good movie...and the concept of TNA's 6 sided ring."
2,Delphi fuel pump OEM Direct replacement #FG0072,This is not a cheap pump and when I read that it is direct OEM replacementthat's what I expect to take it out and plug it innot have to SPLICE A NEW PLUG IN. TYPICAL AC/GM DELPHIeven some of the cheap aftermarket pumps have adaptersnot happy
5,If only all programming books were this concise,"Wow!Thank you Mr.Levinson. Finally, a programming text that is easy to understand and relevant to modern application development.This book is my new bible. I highly recommend it to anyone interested and capable of this level of programming.I especially appreciated the examples, which were not only easy to implement, but presented a logical step-wise approach to the client/server model under .Net."
2,"Maybe a ""newer"" version is better?","OK, the promise is to cut text/pix from the CD and paste it into the word processor -- not nearly as effective as it sounds. The CD does NOT use an OLE based (cut/paste via windows) system. Rather it uses a ""Dyna Text"" browser software system. The charts/tables are secondary pop-ups -- and are in an essentially unreadable font (too light). The promised key word search is flakey. Hey, it's version 1.0 (copyright 1998)-- it's an OLD product!. IF you really want a CD version, check for a newer version -- MAYBE the newer version is ""better"", but this one doesn't measure up to the text version in utility or readability. There is a reason it goes for half list price on the used market."
4,Why the spoiler in the description???,"C'mon, Amazon, you can do better than that. This is one of the few VP movies I haven't seen... and now I know precisely how he dies because i read the description in the Instant Video rent or buy window. Four stars because I know it'll be good, but jeez."
1,Lesbian mirror image,"This book was a sad replica of Sex in the City. Don't get me wrong, it has it's funny parts, however even those I laugh at begrudgingly! From the woman writting the editorial every week about lesbians, to the way that they get together once a week, to the way they met each other, this book just takes Sex and the City and makes the women lesbian! Sadly I read the entire thing hoping it would get better (it doesn't). Don't make the same mistake as me, don't waste your money. There are so many good books out there, keep searching. The book doesn't allow depth or character development. Trust me (even though you don't know me) and don't buy a book by Dean, check out Radclyffe!"
5,Honeytribe one of my favorite bands:,"Honeytribe featuring devon allman is a great cd slip away and no woman no cry is my favorites but all the songs are good the band sounds really good and devon allmans voice will blow you away and the way he can play a guitar is just so interesting and sexy they can rock out trust me. i am a very big fan of devon,jack an honeytribe. I have been going to see devon and jack sence i was 15 and i am 21 now and i still love them they are great go out and get the cd its a good vibe...jessie whiteP.S Go out and see them live also if you get a chance its great*the bootleg cd is awsome also"
4,Underrated buddy action film,"Tense and atmospheric, this is a fine action film featuring the young Charlie Sheen and D.B. Sweeney. An undercover cop (Sweeney) infiltrates the auto theft racket masterminded by the smug, manipulative Sheen and, in no time, he finds himself spiralling into the love of parties, Porsches and, most crucially, Sheen's sister, played by Lara Harris. Though the acting is in a somewhat minor key, the film builds up to a number of absorbing and suspenseful episodes, in addition to containing a subtext on the morals of loyalty and friendship. Altogether, this low-budget thriller, as a car film, easily exceeds in quality the noisier, bigger, but less interesting ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" with Nic Cage."
5,love this movie,"when i was a kid i always liked porsche 911's. so when i saw this movie i thought, ""what a movie?"" it has everything i want...porsche 911's. without giving the movie away, it's about a cop that goes undercover to break up a car theft ring and all they steal are porsche 911's. there's even a line in the movie that says something about ferarri's. i won't quote it here, you can hear it for yourself in the movie. i think they should remake this movie but with me as the lead. actually, now that i think about it, charlie sheen can replay his character and i'll play the goofy cop. charlie, hope you're reading this, make it happen, i hear you have a lot of free time these days."
2,Wrong Workbook,The workbook sent was not the 6th edition as advertised but rather the 4th edition and therefore I was force to buy another workbook. This was $50 wasted.
1,Prego an invitation to italian,"I was very dissatisfied with my purchase and I returned it. The number of the edition should be prominently displayed in the information about the book. I had to pay for S & H, and I have not received a refund jet."
5,The Best Version,"The Douay Rheims is by far the best translation of any of the bibles assuming, of course, that you don't read Latin. TAN publshers recently came out with a book explaining why the DR is the best translation and I highly recommend reading."
5,The People's Version of Douay Rheims,"This version of the true Catholic Bible is portable, readable with clear drawings, notations, prefaces and a good size font for the average person. It is sufficient for anyone who wants to see the way the Bible was intended to be. The book far exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this Bible to anyone who wants to feel the majesty of God and His Church as it was meant to be. While there are other excellent Bibles out there such as St. Joseph, NIV, etc, this is by far the best for any Catholic to live by and read with joy and Peace."
1,Why bother?,"Yet another example of a mainstream political reporter trying to justify the presidency of this pretender to the throne, a fool who didn't even win the election. Corporate progaganda at it's best. Trying to convince our citizens that our leader isn't a dunce. Too bad it doesn't work. Try Micheal Moore's ""Stupid White Men"" instead! Hits WAY closer to the mark."
2,Okay my interest is waning.......,"Only sheer determination did I finish the paperback. Tis' the fourth Tabor Evans' Longarm book I've read, and I know Mr. Evans has the ability to intrigue his readers more so than this particular book does."
3,Must Have Been A Bit Of A Burden For Her Surroundings,"This book catches the spirit of the 70's quite well. The young Alice Munro seems to have been a quite egoistic and whimsical person, and one feels a little sad for those around her who had to pay the price for this; the line of changing men, her children, and her friend, when she sleeps with her husband. On the other hand Alice Munro has got entertainment value, which is why we are reading her books. Properly the 70's, more than any other decade, was filled with adult people quite absorbed in themselves and quite bent upon realizing themselves and this resulted in a considerable neglect towards the children and general chaos. I am myself a child of the 70's and my parents have also both had careers in artistic fields. So I recognize something when I read Alice Munro's book."
5,Very satisfied.,Easy to install.My Rhino goes 68 klms and the roof stays unmoved at top speeds.The only modification I had to add to the usual install was to tape the excess strap front and back.Not mandatory but makes the job tidier and excess strap doesn't flap around.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this phones less than a month ago and had to return it because of numurous problems out of the box. The screen is too small to function well as a touch screen. It constantly froze and had to be rebooted. It would turn off for no reason and sometimes it took 10 to 15 minutes to get it back on. finally it went out (as always with a fully charged battery) and never came back on. I plug it into the wall outlet and still never worked.
3,sd port automatically spoiled......,"This is what looked like the best deal for me.... This black wonder had it all.....I bought a 1gb mini sd card and i plugged it , and.... it worked, lots of storage space for mp3, little videos, and so.....Sudenly i travel to a coastal city, and next thing i notice is my sd card not working..... must be a little glitch i think so i unplug it and plug it again, and..... nothing since then.... i havent been able to use the sd port. The rest is alright, everything works fine, but no sd port.Every time i plug the mini sd card, the system hangs, and after some minutes, it acts like there was nothing plugged in.It was an automatic failure, because i take very good care of everything i own, there were no missuses and it stopped working with no reason....Maybe it was bad luck, and it was only mine the one marked by destiny to fail, but i warn you anyway.... it is more expensive than other smartphones, and in my case..... not so good."
5,An excellent Introduction:Broad but Clear,"This book covers postmodernism in art, politics, history, literature, and culture. Although the book touches all of these subjects, its main concentration appears to be postmodernism in culture and of postmodernism in the context of the self. The book is well written and is quite interesting at times. The writer draws from a large pool of thinkers whose perspectives differ but contribute to the ideas of postmodernism. Overall the book is a fantastic starter to postmodernism not only because of the clarity in which it is written but also due to the amount of postmodern writers the reader is introduced to and is persuaded to read."
4,Granddaughter's gift,All girl's should know something about the vehicles that they are driving or at LEAST have a reference so they can use it as a base.
3,Little Dog Anti Bark Collar from Amazon.com,"I find it difficult to keep the collar in the correct position for it to work well, it wants to sit slightly to the side. When it is in the correct position it does moderate the barking although it doesn't completely eliminate it. I find my dog still barks but does so at considerably lower volume. Still annoying but way better than it was. However when the collar is not in the correct position it is as though it had never been there and the barking continues unabated.I can't stress enough how important it is to remove the collar regularly and in a timely manner as stated in the directions. My dog fought so hard whenever I touched the collar that I stupidly left it on for several days. It left a major sore that took weeks to recover.Would I buy the collar again, knowing what I now know? Absolutely. Any improvement is better than none."
1,Not what is pictured or described,"I received a different product, similar but not what I wanted. After not receiving any support about the issue I attempted to use it. All it does is shock my dog when she is running around and then does not work at all when she barks. The poor thing was too scared to even move because the shocks happened to randomly and I am seriously annoyed that i wasted my money."
3,Good but i would say 45 lbs is a streatch,"This product is very high quality, but i think if your dog is active, high energy and pushes the max weight, its not going to be as effective. Go to the larger model."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COLLAR!,"This collar did not work very long, at all! I, too, kept buying the expensive batteries & it would only work for a week or two... I just fianlly threw it away! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! I am low income, so this feels a lot like a HUGE RIP-OFF! SHAME ON YOU, PET SAFE! Why not just make a decent collar that actually works? If you rip-off enough of us, you'll eventually get a very bad reputation. I guess you'll make plenty of money from idiots like me before that happens though. Thanx for nothing!"
1,Scorched my dog's neck,Please beware when buying this product. Look at the photos in the image gallery of my dog's neck. This product was used exactly under the written directions of the manual. It burned her neck badly. I would never buy this product again. We followed the instructions to the letter and it still burned her neck. Buyer beware!!!!!
5,The right thing to do!,"If you have a barker and close neighbors, this is a must. It stopped the barking by the end of the day for us. I was impressed. Please read and follow the directions. Do remove it when the dog is playing with you or other dogs."
1,Shifts easily and stops working,"I have a 10 lb. Shih Tzu/Maltese mix who barks through the night. Bought this collar without checking reviews. Big mistake! This collar doesn't fit the contours of a small dogs round neck well. One small shake of his head or scratch from a hind leg and the collar moves to one side or the other of his neck and no longer works. No amount of adjusting, tightening, etc. has corrected the problem. I've also tried shaving his fur and tightening the collar to the point that I'm certain it's actually too tight. It still slides to one side or the other and stops working. Now, when I'm up all night listening to my dog bark, I get to think about all the money I threw out the window on this collar, too. I think this collar has actually been more stressful to me than the barking."
4,Review: USB Copy Cruiser Plus from Alertec,"The USB Copy Cruiser Plus is a USB copy device with the additional convenience of an 8-in-1 card reader. The unit will copy from one memory device to another or from one memory device to a USB flash drive without the need of a PC. This OTG (On-The-Go) USB technology is very useful and the USB Copy Cruiser Plus proves to be just that, useful. For the small foot-print and compact size, just bigger then your palm, the product performs well, is easy to use and provides clear and precise feedback. [...]"
5,"Funny Movie, And Apparently Consulted by the US Catholic BIshops!","Proving again that life is stranger than fiction, and that you couldn't make a lot of stuff up if you tried, is this very weird factoid. Apparently the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have consulted typical word-usage in modern cultural efforts, such as this as a lodestar, for their recent liturgical changes. Yes, pop culture is so important to these Bishops, maybe especially to African American eminences, that a perfectly good word, used by Shakespeare no less must be un-personed so that the cultural dumbing-down that is Catholicism today reaches a symbolic apotheosis in semantics. Thus we might say, their new choice of the word the word ""spoils"" is the down-low version of ""booty"" for their new Catholic liturgy. Everything to negate sex, even when sex was not even intended. You truly couldn't make this stuff up."
4,"Great vinyl, perfect condition","Love the product! Vinyl came still in packaging, no rips tears wear etc on the cover. The actual vinyl sounds great too, and no imperfections on the record.Only giving 4/5 stars as it took quite a long time to get to me and was a week late for my boyfriend's birthday. Granted I live in Hawaii, but I ordered another record on the same day and it arrived in a few days vs. 2 weeks. The order was shipped right away, but the shipping method chosen by seller was not the best."
1,blah,"sorry but I've read more Romance novels that I can count but I just can't get into a story about women being raped.. not exactly Romance in my eyes.. even if they do ""love each other"" at the end."
4,A World of Poetry,"Well, unlike the other two reviewers, I enjoyed reading these poems to my children. I reviewed the book in the store before deciding to buy it. The two poems that were given as examples can be considered another way. The poem of war is very descriptive and true to life. Should war be viewed antiseptically? Should children believe war is a good easy thing the way our current administration would have us believe? The poem about the teacher was funny. Teachers come in with daggers in their eyes. The poem was symbolic. You know about symbolism don't you? What's wrong with getting the kids' attention, showing them that poetry isn't all stopping by the woods on a snowy evening. I've got tons of sweet poetry books for the early years. Many of these poems are great discussion starters. My kids listened intently. My son started some prose immediately after."
1,Never Delivered!!,"This item has never been delivered. According to the Amazon website the estimated delivery date is 26,27 December 06 and yet today is 15Jan07. There has been no update or offer of options to me.Please advise,"
5,Great Read,"Rasimus returns to Vietnam for a second tour after transitioning to F-4's. We are indebted to Rasimus for his courage and his intellect. The book is superb.The book covers the air war from the height of air war against North Vietnam and the massive B-52 raids to the dog days near the end of the war when the REMF's came to get their tickets punched. Rasimus captures it all, from the sweaty, terror filled minutes of endless Sam killing missions deep over North Vietnam to the days near the end of the war when US planes did not venture into North Vietnam. The friendly skies of South Vietnam brought out those who had avoided the air war in various Pentagon burrows to get their 201 files filled with combat flying. Rasimus sorts out the good guys like Robin Olds from the slackers with a sharp knife.What differentiates this book from many other fine books is Rasimus' intellect and writing skills . Highly recommended."
3,Nice cutting board,"The product description states the board is 2"" high. It's actually close to 3"" with the legs. The board at first looked great, until I noticed that two of the sides looks like they patched in some bamboo. I can actually see a seam where the side meets the top, across 2/3 of the board on each patched side.I'm sure the board will serve its purpose. We have another smaller/thinner bamboo board and I really like it. Unlike the BOO's Wood Butcher Block, the bamboo does not retain odors from onion, garlic, etc. It cleans easily with soap and water. Every few months I had to apply a baking soda paste to the Boo's Block to keep the odors down....and sometimes I had to use a mild bleach solution.Bamboo is the only way to go."
1,Just awful,"Confusing start - unless I am missing part of a set? Characters who are crucial to the plot are dead and referred to by other characters. Filming style attempts to be ""unique"" but is just irritating. Too much soap-opera type drama among the characters. I couldn't finish watching it, the camera style alone drove me crazy."
3,"Entertaining, predictable","10.5 apocalypes is a disaster film about quakes. Essentially, a big quake reverses the continental drift and causes a huge gulf to form in the central USA. The first part of this film was pretty good. You see the aftershocks take down Mount Rushmore, several cities and cause massive computerized destruction.The problem I had with the film is the blandness of the characters. Some were even unlikeable. The friction beween Brad (Dean Cain's Character), his little brother and his wife was just painful. They act like teenagers. Who couldn't predict what happened to Brad? I didn't honestly like any of them, didn't care whether they lived or died, and had no interest in their soapy melodramas.The response from FEMA given their field record in real life was a bit comic. The disasters, however were great, and well worth watching, although the story lagged in the second part with the rescue in the casino.3 stars. Would've been vastly improved by likeable characters."
5,Edward Sullivan,"The FBI Story is a very entertaining film about the experience of one FBI agent (played by Jimmy Stewart) and his family from the birth of the agency, through the gangster years of the 30s, World War II and the early 1950s. Stewart along with Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton give fine performances in a film that is both serious & fun, well-paced, entertaining and in some moments, very moving. A fine film that I would recomend to anybody."
3,What happened to the last chapter?,"Most people who have watched this film on cable in the last few years think that the FBI capture Whitey the spy, then Jimmy Stewart rides off into the sunset with his family.But the ending I remember before Stewart drives away through Washington, DC has Nick Adams planting a bomb in his mother's suitcase so it will detonate in mid-flight and he can collect the life insurance proceeds.This was cut well before 9/11. Does anybody know why? Nick Adams is still listed as having appeared in the film."
3,"towels ok not as soft as I wanted , are big and thick",I was looking for the ultimate in big towel softness this one is not it for me. For the cost of it I would of rather gone into the store in person to try out the softness before spending this much . If I had felt them I would not had bought. Where is the ultimate in softness for towels that stay soft wash after wash without fabric softner and is using no softner as per instructions from towel makers a ploy to now get towels to be rough and continue to rough out so you buy more ?? Used to there were never such do not use softner instructions on towels. Oh well the search goes on .
3,Saw the play first,"I saw the this first as a play by a local group. Sorry, but I liked the play much better. The movie was fine, just not as crisp as was the play. Overall, good british humor."
3,Super Reader,"""Hypothetically,"" I said, ""if a superpowered android were to escape, where would it go?""This is the problem for Zachary Nixion Johnson, the last private investigator on earth. A medium boiled PI, he has a lightly boiled supercomputer assistant named HARV, luckily for him. Imagine Orac with a personality, and Zach is a cross between something out of 2000AD and DC's Star Hawkins.Given that the android double of the femme fatale he has to track down has 200 times the physical abilities of a normal human, and is nuclear powered, having help is good. He also has a genius scientist friend that has fitted him up with some nifty body armour.Zach's girlfriend could probably enjoy drinks with the Stainless Steel Rat's wife, too.Light, fast, and diverting."
2,Not really a bombshell,"OK, there's a decent plot, and it follows the basic rules of science fiction mysteries: create a world and then live within its rules. But the silly language gets in the way and makes it hard to read, and the action really doesn't get off the ground. Good effort, but not too many points."
4,price was right,this songbook is great from an historical standpoint. provides history of many older songs and when and where they were popular.
1,A waste of money!,"This video looks like it was put together with still shots (yes, a slideshow) and someone's homemade movies. It's a deplorable waste of money. There is no dialog, just a series of stitched together music clips. Get this: The video portions of two of the towns are just sit the camera on a tripod and let it photograph the town's one traffic light! I would not even have watched this if it was free. And for the record -- I almost never write bad reviews."
3,Seimi-helpful,"The book is not well edited. It does with only mechanics of a car, and not how to deal with sales people."
4,TOO MANY COOKS SPOIL THE SONGS,"THE RIP CHORDS ARE A GREAT GROUP. BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE LEAD SINGERS IS MY COUSIN ERNIE BRINGAS. HEY,LITTLE COBRA HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST HOT ROD ALBUMS AROUND. WHEN THREE WINDOW COUPE CAME OUT, THE WAS ALOT OF TENSION WITH THE FACT THAT TERRY MELCHER HAD BROUGHT IN BRUCE JOHNSTON,AND TOGETHER, THEY STARTED WRITING AND COMPOSING THE SONGS FOR LITTLE COBRA. THE GROUP HAD DONE THIS WITHOUT THEIR HELP ON HEY,LITTLE COBRA. AND THEY HAD A GREAT GREAT ALBUM. ITS UNFORTUNATE THAT SOMEONE HAD TO COME IN AND START TELLING THEM HOW TO WRITE, HOW TO COMPOSE AND HOW TO SING. LIKE SO MANY GROUPS AT THAT TIME, THEY FELL LIKE A BUCKET OF BRICKS. HERE TODAY, GONE TOMORROW. BUT THE RIP CHORDS LIVE ON...THEIR MUSIC IS STILL GREAT... HEY,ERNIE!! YOU STILL DID A GOOD JOB ON HERE I STAND!!!"
2,Hilarious,"This move is so bad, that it is actually funny The costumes, dialogue and props are often anachronistic. The plot loses track of itself. It's so funny to see things totally out of that place and time, watching the movie to spot them is entertaining."
4,Indiana Jones meets The Mumy @ Stargate,A fun experience. As a mini-series it has choppy breaks where commercials are meant to be placed. Fun for the entire family (if the young kids are not bothered by some images to effect thier dreams).
2,Comes apart when you change settings,"Try changing settings on this one and you will have the shower-head on your head. Had to run behind springs in the midst of a shower to stop them from going down the drain.As long as it does not come apart, it works very well."
3,A bit deceived,I had bought Asleep in the back and still listen it songs like Scattered black & whites was well defined really good melody but Cast of Thousands is not a well continuous 2nd album i listened 5 times and not so great...i'll check it out more few times...
5,Brilliant,"Cast of Thousands gets my vote for the best album of 2003. Each track is beautifully written, sung, and performed. I highly, highly recommend it to anybody and everybody because that is what it has...something for everybody. I bought my album used at a record shop. After listening to it, I couldn't believe anybody would let this album go. Fantastic, brilliant, beautiful, moving, joyous, mournful, and introspective are just a few words to describe it. Anyone who says this is just another brit-rock album obviously hasn't listen to it."
3,The Mullan Road,"This book written in the 1960's provided a good overview of John Mullan's work focused on creating a military wagon road. The wagon road connected the Missouri River with the Columbia River across the Rocky Mountains. However, it was based largely on material published in printed government reports. But for years handwritten journals were available for research at the National Archieves in Washington, D. C. and these have not been used up to this point to fill in the gaps within the government reports. They were not used because it is very difficult to read Mullan's handwritting. In a new book partially titled: The Mullan Road-A Vision Fulfilled, these deficency will be reduced. The book is scheduled for publication in 2013"
2,"Almost worthless - to me, anyway","I have had this book for years, and have yet to use it a single time. It has about 10 or so ""mini-scenarios"" or interludes, a few of which are a bit longer. They are intended for insertion into an ongoing campaign. My main problem with the book is that many of them are set in way out-of-the-way places, like Siberia and India, and the 3 or 4 that aren't are short and not very good. This is definitely the worst Call of Cthulhu supplement I own. Although I should add that most of the ones I own are absolutely excellent, so perhaps my expectations for a CoC book are a bit higher than for most RPGs."
2,YUCCK,"If the British think this is comedy, I would hate to see their drama. Looks to me to be a treatise on city life in Liverpool. Buildings are boarded up. Everything is in ruin. Trash and abandoned vehicles everywhere. Young punks roaming the streets mugging people. Even the people scurry around like rats. What a bunch of derelicts. The movie is depressing. I bought the movie to watch Joanne Whalley. I can't believe she would lend her talents to such a film. This certainly is not their finest hour."
1,Pretty much useless,"These are probably the most useless and uncomfortable pieces of dirt I've ever bought. And I paid the full 30 bucks for them at a NIke Store. They don't fit, there is no tension control, so they just flop around and I'm not sure who's ears they designed them to fit in, but they don't fit in mine or any one of my three friends that I had try them on. I sold them on ebay for 10 bucks to recoupe part of my cost. Lesson learned, NEVER buy headphones w/o trying them on first. The iPod ear buds, while pretty much useless also, are 100 percent better than these. DO NOT BUY these."
4,"Not for you, if you liked ""Piranha"" ...","This is a slow, dense and very good story. I saw it in Blu-ray and it has one of the best video quality I've seen. Like I said, not for ""Piranha"" fans."
2,The Cheyenne Social Club,"Good old fashioned fun. Good performances by the 3 leads. Reasonable plot. The female characters were classy, considering their profession in the story. Mildly sexist. Always good to see the old screen icons, Fonda and Stewart (and Jones). A classic. Worth a look, if only for curiousity."
3,"Same old, same old","I have read most of the books written about Elizabeth Taylor and while her life makes for fascinating ""truth is stranger than fiction""-style reading, I don't think this book particularly sheds any new light on her as a woman or actress. It gets especially thin in substance toward the end chapters as it relies heavily on her early more sexually active days. As is always the case with Ms. Taylor, the photos are absolute eye candy, but too few of those as well!"
2,Really?,Were there really as many gay/bisexual men in Hollywood as the book indicates because it seems like it included pretty much everyone?? I'm about 3/4 way through the book and it's so twisted and dysfunctional it's hard to believe that was someone's actual life...especially when that someone seemed to have everything in the world going for them. Seems sad and pathetic at the same time.
4,The Older Beginner Piano Course,Really easy to follow and learn. Love it. I will most likely order Level 2 once I complete Level 1 with confidence.
3,Minor thing,"It isn't the best you'll ever see, but it isn't the worst either. It's ok. I enjoyed the cast."
4,"Fun, upbeat, sassy romantic comedy with a Sacramento backdrop","Great guy gets girl and vice versa with lots of twists and turns and smart, sassy comedic interludes. A great movie when you get together with your girlfriends...and guys like it too...but they might not admit it!I love all the Sacramento backdrops..a great movie if you live in Sac because you can pick out lots of venues."
3,great tank- crappy light fixture and return policy,We love this tank- easy on the eyes...fish seem happy too! But- 5 days post the return date the light fixture broke. Called PETCO to see if we could get a new fixture and was told too bad- return date had passed and we were given 3 phone numbers to call- non of which answered the phone. Long story short- this is a $60 replacement hood and that is a rip off seeing that we spent $135 for the tank and hood.....so we are trying to solution it ourselves. Be warned- if you buy this tank- be sure the fixture works well- watch it closely...and return it asap...ours broke 5 days too late!
3,A Fascinating Dictionary,"There are not many people who know a lot about African countries today, and there are far less who are aware of the immense mythology that exists on this ancient continent. A Dictionary of African Mythology changes this. In paperback form and being not that long, this edition serves as a handy reference tool, with a thorough index, for anyone writing papers on this subject. But it also serves as a most interesting book about a giant continent whose mythology is not really known about. In an easy-to-read dictionary form, you can either start at the beginning, or flip to a random page. Whatever you choose to do, it will ultimately open new worlds to, and tales of countries you were never even sure existed before.Originally published on November 25th, 2002.Go to BookBanter ([...]) for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
1,No go,"I've had no success with the whole biolean system and in fact felt it made me ill, anxious and gave me headaches."
3,Average book,"I kind of expected a better binding, but it is a book,and looks like it will be okay on the shelf. Haven't read it,so can't comment there,except that Fitzgerald was a master,and thus it should be good."
1,"Garbage, garbage, oh and GARBAGE","Holy smokes do these suck. After three days use they have bent from my thumb holding the backside. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy these, if they are given to you use them for fire wood."
3,Heavy Duty????,"This cart will do if you really need one in a hurry. I do not see where it is heavy-duty, more like medium duty. It does have a enough space to store items under it. I received mine with a BAD wheel(no bushing), that impressed me enough to make me to consider to pack it up and send it back. Needing one in a hurry, I kept it like it was. If a person doesn't get to rough on it I guess it would make a decent cart."
4,"Love online outlined (or ""How to type 45 WPM w/ 1 hand"")","A sharp and funny guide to the do's and don't's (definitely a lot of don't's!) of cyber-romance, chat room flirting, and the occasional online sexual encounter. There's nothing new in here to someone who's already experimented substantially with online love, but for the novice, the curious, or the simply voyeuristic, it's a fun, pointed, and oh-so-practical guide to being online, being careful, and being wild. Worth the price of admission merely for the section of on-line etiquette. Now get out in the real world and get some fresh air!!!"
3,Okay,"Didn't care for the question and answer format, information seemed scattered, but good personal stories."
1,Not Much of a Present,"This is not a book I ever liked.It's Danny's mother's birthday and Danny wants to give her something. He asks every animal on the farm what to give her. They all suggest things she already has.Finally a bear tells Danny to hug her for her birthday, so he does. End of story.This story always seemed like a letdown to me. He could hug her any time. That answer always seemed like such an easy out."
1,If you liked Aha Shake Heartbreak you will hate this.,"This was a total let down. Their last album was one of my favorites and I was physced for this to come out. Gone is the original sounding Dixie fried garage rock sound that put them on the map. They totally changed. Sounds like they put a lot of money into it. They also said they were drunk the whole time recording this one unlike their past albums. Sounds like it's not working for them.Their album after this one ""Only By The Night"", from what I've heard of it so far, seems like their making this new sound work for them. But do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,Because of Something.....this one stinks,"Let me start off by saying I love the Kings of Leon. In fact they are my favorite band. Their first two albums rocked. Both are 5 stars in my book. In addition, in concert these guys take it to another level. For those reasons this reveiw hurts. Because of the Times is a giant disappointment. I am not sure what album some of the reveiwers listened to but this album is nowhere near 5 stars. Apparently Ethan Johns or one of the boys discovered the reverb machine recently because overproduced echoes litter each song. The first 4 songs are almost unlistenable--for some reason the Kings added high pitched guitars or screeches to some otherwise decent tunes. I keep hoping the Kings will break into the big time but this album wont do it. If youre going to emulate U2 atleast make it early U2 and not songs like ""Lemon"". Kings please lose the pretension and come back to Rock for your next album."
2,"Great music, Horrible sonics","I really enjoyed the music on this Lp..but, the whole reason for purchasing an Lp was for better sonics... which, on this ""red"" colored album, are horrible...the background noise drowns out any low level music...A ""re-issue"" should be done for customers who have recieved the bad vinyl...Rick"
4,Great sounds from a great band,"I loved their first two albums more but this album, the guys from Kings of Leon show they are growing up. Great tracks!"
3,Baffled,"After having Aha Shake Heartbreak climb its way to near the top of my favorite albums of the last 5 years, I couldn't wait for this album to come out. But when I listened for the first time, I was let down. Why do all these reviews call it their ""best""? Whatever they captured for the last album wasn't here. There are a few good songs, but nothing that gives my that rush when I hear the first few notes(you know, when you lean over & turn up the volume because THAT song is on). I really WANTED to love this, but I just can't. It kinda sounds the same, but something is missing. Ah well, I'll always have Aha Share Heartbreak."
5,ViewMaster Viewer,"This ViewMaster viewer is very much the same as the one I had when I was a child. Very durable, and it is easy for young children to use. The price is certainly reasonable, making it easy for everyone to afford. Children will love it, and with a few reels, will be enthralled for hours. You can't go wrong with this item. It is difficult, however, to find a great variety of suitable reels. I recommend the scenic and nature reels, and the wild animal reels."
2,not for Mac users!,"I purchased this book mainly for the CD test. Too bad for me that nowhere in the reviews does it mention that it can't be used in a Mac! I don't really care for the format of the questions, either - I've purchased much better review guides; especially the CLS Review by Harr (of course, you can't use it's floppy in a Mac, either - that's why I wasted my money on another book)"
2,NCA review for the Clinical laboratory,This book was a waste of money. I also gave it to a CLS student and she didn't even look at it. There are way better books for CLS reviews. Not enough depths.
3,Backstory,"A low-key, amiable behind-the-scenes pastry from Francois Truffaut about a film's clumsy production.Props go awry, actors flake out, love is won, lost, teased. Truffaut directs onscreen and off.This is amusing and always engaging, and certainly worth seeing, but neither the fictional film at the center nor the general article amount to very much. Most absorbing when it depicts just how hard moviemaking is (Valentina Cortese's breakdown is excruciating; a problem with a kitten, hilarious). Also noteworthy for its sprawl and ensemble work, both of which are Altman-esque."
1,Truffaut IS timeless!,"I can't express how bad I feel about this movie not being available in the subtitled version.They are depriving us of one of the best films of all time, by one of the best directors. NOT FAIRNot only that, but the version they DO offer is so horribly dubbed and what about that price!!!!I am completely against this type of crimes.PLEASE release it in the subtitled version, and please readable subtitles with good translation. And if at all possible CRITERION please take note!"
2,Truffaut is not timeless,"This is really one of those movies that is one of the favorites of every 30+ filmcritic. OK, the idea is fantastic and the two layers combine interestingly, but it really takes a long time before you realise what it all is about, or who is who, or whatever. Not that Truffaut is known for his highly understandable films, but the first hour of this one just shows ""babbling frenchmen"" who do not seem to know what they are doing on this film set. I know this is too simple to say, but i just think that this movie doesn't work anymore in 1999. That might be the reason why older people prefer this one above a younger generations."
4,A pitifully overlooked show,"I'm shocked at such a abysmal score for such a nicely produced showI saw the show via Hulu and may i say it's not worth the 2 stars it was givenUnlike South Park and Family Guy, The characters are likeable to a mild degree and the episodes aren't focused on soon-to-be dated topicsThe character that steals the show is Vince, while he's not everyone's fave - he is funny with his intentionally censored dialogueThe show may not be for everyone but it is really fun to watch"
5,"Hilarious, moving, and beautifully written","Like all Powers' books, this is so funny, it's easy to forget how well-written it is. Wonderful stuff I'll return to again and again. By the way, what ever happened to ""The Unoriginal Sinner and the Ice Cream God""? I loved that one, too, and it's not on the list of Powers' books. Someone out there is missing out!"
3,"Good Writing, Only OK Story","I read this one next for the book club. I have to say that although the writing was solid, the story just didn't grab me, and I wasn't totally sympathetic to the characters' actions. Granted, my frame of reference is American (the story takes place in the UK and Iran), but I had trouble understanding the mother's behavior, in particular--she came across as selfish and avoidant to me. I give it a B."
4,Beautiful...,"If I were still in academia, I'd start a program in ex-pat Iranian literature. I'm totally intrigued with how the writers, including Crowther, manage to capture a world through sounds, smells, sights and texture, as opposed to a the way James and others catured the world through manners - the way a cane was held, a handkerchief dropped, etc. Kudos to this writer. It may be a bit of a ""woman's"" story, but the book is magical."
4,Deliciously Delivered,"My wife and I are both enjoying The Saffron ""Kitchen"". It was easy to order, well presented, and so far no after effects other than the satisfaction of knowing we have been well served."
3,Great at first.... Now calling Dr. Leaky Bunn!,"I've been using the Bunn for about two years.... Love the speed and makes great coffee.But now my Bunn is leaking like a lot of others have been reporting. It's now also blasting coffee groundsup and out of the basket and into the coffee. Yes, I am using the special ""Bunn"" recommended filters!New owners, enjoy your Bunn.... while it is young! Don't expect it to behave itself more than a couple of years.I'm going back to a $25.00 Mr. Coffee. While he may be slow, he also makes great coffee and when he stops working you can toss him in the trash without wondering why you spent a hundred bucks on a coffee maker.It was great while it lasted, but did I get my money's worth with the Bunn? Probably not."
2,Better For Restaurants,This coffee maker is extremely long. It sticks out too far forward and took up too much counter space. It was also quite expensive so I returned it.
2,coffee maker mayhem,"I didn't know enough about this product before I bought it. For me, it is too tall for my cabinets; cannot be programmed to turn on automatically; must be kept ""on"" at all times to keep water hot (I still do not understand why); drips quite a bit whenever I put water in; is simply not at all convenient in my opinion. No one in my family likes it. As a coffee maker, I did not find the coffee to be significantly better than the other, much cheaper, models I've used."
5,Bunn coffee maker,"I bought this as a gift for my son in law as he likes the way the one we have at our house works, very quickly and dependably. This is a very well made product that delivers coffee fast for years and require very little maintenance."
1,Poorly Made,"I had owned a Bunn coffee maker previously and loved it, previously. I bought this one to replace my old one. When I first plugged it in it had an electrical smell of burning plastic for several days. That did eventually go away. Then numerous times when I would wipe down the sprinkler head area to clean off any coffee grounds, the sprinkler head came off very easily. On my old Bunn coffee maker I never had this happen. This one came off repeatedly and then finally it must have fallen off without me realizing it and apparently when I emptied the coffee filter and grounds at some point I threw the sprinkler head away. So now it is useless unless I order a new sprinkler head. I know most of the reviews of this item have been good. Mine was likely that 1 out of 1000 that was a lemon, but I will never purchase another one of this model."
5,Bunn is exceptional,"The Bunn GRX-B is exactly what I was looking for. It remains plugged in and turned on at all times to keep the water in the reserve at a constant temperature. When you are ready to brew, because of this system, you can brew a full pot of coffee in 3 minutes. It's different than anything I've ever used and I'm very pleased."
5,Great coffee! Fast!!!,We finally switched from a slow drip to this high speed coffee maker for our office. Because its so fast anyone is willing to make a pot and it tastes great! No more bitter coffee. Yea!
2,"Yes, everything the previous reviewer wrote, except...","..the first chapter is beautifully written. Loulan's lost credibility these days, however, and it's perhaps a political statement to purchase (or not to) her books."
4,"Comprehensive, useful guidebook","Each of the 500+ entries in this comprehensive guidebook includes symbols indicating sun, shelter, and water requirements of the plant, flowering period, and zone(s) of hardiness. The plants are organized by categories such as indoor flowering plants, rock garden plants, climbers, medicinal plants, water plants, and so on. There is a section on roses, one on lilies, and one on orchids. Each entry includes family, origin, brief description, flowering time, use, propagation , environment, soil type, and soil moisture. Glossary, index. For additional photos of many of these plants, seeOrnamental Plants & Flowers of Tropical Mexico."
4,Simon & Schusters Guide to Plants & Flowers,I bought this book a long time ago and used it to identify plants for annual flower shows when I was in a garden club. It's very easy to search through the book and get a brief description of the plant. Each plant is pictured in full color. I just wish there were more plants included. I just purchased another copy of this book as a gift to a friend. She loves it.
5,Glad I ordered this one!,"Just received this wonderful butcher block! It arrived within a few days, was well packed and in perfect condition. It's just the right size for a home cutting board that is first rate! I'm in the process of seasoning it now and can't wait to start using it. I made a space for it by my sink so it is handy and it looks just beautiful. It's solid and wonderfully made. Don't hesitate to buy this one, you won't be disappointed."
3,butter slicer,"The unit would work for a large quantity user.For home use it is not too practical. There is on themarket a plastic butter slicer. Butter is in a tube with aslider to move out the desired quantity. A wire cutter cuts offthe desired amount. I have have five and each has worked for ashort period, then one part or another breaks. If the unitcould be produced in stainless it would be a winner."
4,Good stereo at a low price with lots of features,"Bought this to mount in our boat. So I was looking for a cheaper priced stereo with a detachable faceplate and MP3 / Aux input. This one works well, dim display but it doesn't affect it's performance for us. If it we're in a car then I'm sure it's good enoungh. The face plate is hard to mount for some reason, other than that it's worked and sounded great. I'd recommend it for someone looking for a decent inexpensive stereo."
1,not functioning,"I live outside of the united states and bought this radio through a friend who visited the states. when I got the radio it did not work, and a proffesional technician checked it and confirmed that the system is out of order. I wrote a mail to ANTonline service and did not get any answer."
2,wrong parts,Received the Raider ATV cabin cover very quickly however the parts in the box were wrong. I received 2 c posts for the same side. Very disappointed.
5,Easy to use - sounds just fine for daughter's use,"We bought this for our daughter's 13 birthday - it works just great for her use. She takes it outside and she and friends listen, dance, etc. She really likes it because they can bring their I-pod and plug them right in for a change of music collection. Easy to use, sounds fine, seems to be sturdy enough."
2,Poor radio reception,"Great idea for a product: CD player, ipod player and radio in one unit, but the sound quality isn't too great, the radio has poor reception, and my ipod doesn't charge in this unit. So, back it goes.My old Logitech little portable speakers that I use with an ipod charger plugged into the wall has better sound and for less dough, Joe.Probably a good unit for kids like some of the reviews say. If quality sound and charging are important to you, you might want to skip this."
5,beautiful music for love,"I have loved Craig Pruess and been listening to his music for many years. This CD is more sultry and exotic and is fantastic background music for massage, yoga, or exquisite candlelight encounters with a beloved.He has captured the subtle sound of sensuous delight, and would be a great CD to inspire sacred dance."
5,Great Tank,Great tank. Lifetime warranty. The only downside is the light it came with. Underpowered for the size of the tank. Buy a quality light. Overall great buy.
5,Very practical Tote,I like my tote very much. Very good price quality ratio. Looks much more feminine than the cases.It is not as useful as the carrying cases because the cases are far too big and thus you can use it as an overnight bag and at the same time use it for your laptop.I prefer the tote because I feel more feminine.
3,"help a pony,would ya","This record is ridiculous,but also carefully crafted,ween was going for something here. The ""spinal"" and ""pony"" songs are as strong and strange as anything I've ever heard........... If you're intrigued by the reviews here,plunk down the money and get it,it will keep your attention with it's wide range of styles if nothing else,some tracks are weak to me,but might end up as your favorites,it's that type of album.....i'm no ween freak,this is the only ween cd i have,but this is worth looking into if you want to hear something really different and somewhat original.............."
4,"Great Product, EXCEPT ...","I've used Moodmatcher lipsticks for years now and prefer them over conventional lipsticks.That said, the product claim that they don't rub off is inaccurate. They absolutely do rub off on coffee cups, glasses etc., which can sometimes be challenging to clean. Same applies when kissing (don't be fooled!) and your partner's mood will instantly surface in a colorful way. Be aware! :-)"
1,It's like using a neon pink highlighter,"I ordered the purple. Came as a soft pink in the tube, but became an angry hot pink on me, enough to light a dark room, unwearable. Wiped it off right away but still had traces on it 7 hours later and my lips were starched. In the garbage! Would have given zero stars if possible."
5,Good Book,"Good book, Unusual subject. As with all books of this type, you have to question how many of these designs were ""paper airplanes"" that had no chance of ever being built. But it is still interesting to look through the vivid imaginations of the designers."
5,Duh,"If you want to hear ""Intergalactic"" and ""Fight for your right"" then look elsewhere. I, myself am a punk, and a punk fan. I also love hip hop, metal, folk and a bunch of other genres, but punk is definetly my first choice. In my opinion this album (well..the albums that these songs were taken from) is in the top 5 of 80s punk cds. This is how punk should be. Simple, snotty, fast and furious. ..."
2,WARNING: VERY UNLIKE THEIR LATER STUFF!,"Nothing like anything on Hello nasty, and completely different from all their other stuff. I love the Beasties, but I can't reccomend this album! It sounds like three high teenagers screaming into a mike w/ no skills! Sorry beasties but I really disliked it!"
2,Huge letdown,"As an avid funk of both punk and the Beastie Boys, I figured I couldn't lose with this CD-it was by the Beastie Boys, and I had been told by many prior to my purchase that it is very Punk-esque. In truth, I didn't like it at all. I wold never knock the B-Boys and downplay the alubum-surely it must be seen, if nothing else, as the beginning of an amazing thing. However, I would not recommend this album to B-Boy fans or punk fans for that matter."
3,chirstian thriller,"Great book. All three books in the series are excellent. I am hoping there will be a fourth one. If you enjoyed the Left Behind series you will definitely enjoy this one. It is about an archeology professor who tries to prove what the bible says is fact. The is a secret group that is out to kill the main character, because they don't want the people to know the bible is true."
1,A Few Steps Down From The Original,"The first book in this series was awesome, but this one took forever to get started. For the first couple hundred pages the story is slooooooow, then all of a sudden it's like Lahaye realizes that the due date of the book is approaching and he quickly rushes to make his story complete. Maybe next time Lahaye will not procrastinate until the last minute as it seems as if he has done here."
