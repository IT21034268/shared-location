1,Useless,"Not nearly strong/sharp enough to cut a raw potato, and it actually broke the first time I used it. The plastic part that connects to the metal handle bent and snapped. I wasted my money for sure."
4,Review for Progressive Internatinal Jumbo Potato Cutter,"I really like this product. Much easier than cutting my own fries with a knife. It was way easier than I thought it would be to get the potatoe through. We go camping and make our own fries by cutting them with a knife. I do this at home too. If you like making your own fries this is a really good, easy to use and easy to clean product. You can make thick or think fries with the different grates. Very cool. I love it."
4,Great Value - Better have muscle,"If you have the muscle, you can push out some great fries with this economical cutter. I've used for a couple of months and have had great success. It's big enough to cut full size potatoes and I like the 2 size cutter heads.Easy to clean - a little tough to use."
4,Misleading Description,"I just received this product. I specifically ordered this because the Amazon Product Review stated it would cut 1/4 and 3/8 inch fries. Perfect for my needs. However, I measured the cutting grids and they are actually 3/8 and 1/2 inch. Makes me wonder if the Amazon folks actually looked at the product?"
5,Catalytic Books,Books have changed my life in many major ways and I would list a number of Gay Hendricks books on that list of mine. They have assisted me to open up my vision of what I really want and the direction I want to take my life in. In this latest addition I appreciate the variety of books referred to and also the stories the individuals share on how they were personally impacted. Now I have a ready made list of books to add to my wish list that I plan to discover on my travels for the next year or so.
3,a useful overview of some great books,"Reading this book reminded me of some old favorites, as well as some ""classic"" books I had never gotten around to reading."
1,waste of time and money.,"a quickly slapped together collection of of this or that book from this or that person - might make a good magazine article but even then, I got nothing out of this book. Also be aware of the viral marketing going on for this book. Sad to say that its become a problem on Amazon."
5,Vivian Hsu - The Greatest Hits,"This is Vivian Hsu's greatest hits album. There are two CDs, with ten songs on each, for a total of 20 tracks. That's a little more than 40 minutes of music on each disc. There is also a DVD with ten music videos and a featurette with a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the music videos. The videos and featurette together have a total of about 63 minutes running time. There is also a booklet with the lyrics to the songs (not in English, though). The only problem for me and other Americans is that there is little here that is in English. After all, it really wasn't made to be sold in the USA. There are no subtitles on the DVD that I could find, either. This is still a great package for Vivian Hsu fans and for those who aren't yet familiar with her or her career, no matter where they live or what language(s) they speak."
1,"I would give it negitive stars if I could!!!!! DON""T BUY THIS DUMB GAME!!!!","Don't buy this game!!!! I Love Let's ride games, but this one was a dud!!!! The graphics are terrible!!!!! and you can either go on a trail ride or a competion, and you can only do 1 thing per day because it says your horse is too tired!!! And I wasted $20 on that stupid game, and I'm 10, and it takes along time to make $20. And top top off the cake, you aren't even Cale Crane!!!!! Your this some weird girl named amy!!! DON'T LISTEN to people who say to buy it!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A STUPID GAME LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!! I think they are trying to trick you to buy it just because it had dreamer on the cover!!! And Amy's Adventure isn't even the story of dreamer!! It will catch your eye just like me but DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Negative Stars?? Yes.,"I would give this game negative stars if I could. This game is so boring; it's almost too young for me; an 11 year old. Amy (the character) has such an annoying voice that I want to mute the sound when I play it. Amy and Eddy act ridiculous with each other.Here are the pros and cons.Pros:You get to choose your horseYou get to groom your horseCons:Amy's voice is annoyingEddy and Amy act really weirdIt's way too easyHas a ridiculous storylineAlmost everything should go in the ""cons"" categoryDon't waste your money. Get Saddle Up With Pippa Funnell any day for a good horse game."
1,Disappointing,"If, like me, you are interested in this game because you think it might be like the movie, then you, like me, will be very disappointed. Yes, it says Dreamer in the title, but aside from character names, that is all this game has in common with the movie.The game itself is very boring. You spend the majority of your time taking care of your horse...that's it. It takes several ""game days"" to get to the next level of competition. The competitions are a joke, it's very easy to beat.All in all, very disappointing considering the Let's Ride series has had some great games like Equestriad 2001 and the Rosemond Hill collection.Don't make the mistake I did and buy this game. It isn't worth the money.The better horse riding games are from Lexis Numerique, the Saddle Up Time to Ride and Saddle Up with Pippa."
5,Very fun!!! (by erica),"This game is very fun! you can compete in many kinds of competitions and choose from a large selection of horses and ponies. I suggest choosing Sonya, Louis, or Ontario for your horses. You will need a horse that can jump well and can gallop for long distances. I have a 2003 computer and the game freezes my computer after playing it for 30-40 minuits."
2,Not a very good game,"This game was a big disappointment for me. It has hardly anything to do with the movie. In fact, the only thing it has to do with it is one of the horses you can have is named Sonya. The graphics aren't wonderful and the jumping courses are nearly impossible! Also, when you win a tournament, you can never win anything from it again! The only thing fun about it is the trail rides. There are many much better games out there; don't waste your money on this one."
2,Sounds Like A Stupid Game,"I have been collecting Let's Ride! games for a couple of years, and recently have had my eye on this one. Before I buy a game online, I always check the reviews. The reviews for this game sound like the game is just awful! I have seen the movie, and the cover of the game. The cover shows it has absaloutly NOTHING to to with horse racing! It's Dressage, Show Jumping, and Cross Country! If you want a better, more fun game, I suggest Let's Ride Champions Collection."
1,Do not buy this game!!!!!!!!!,I got this game for my Daughter and i have to tell you it's not worth it. The game plays fine but once you come to the point where you have to compete in the trail/jump competion you can't beat the score from that Antonia girl.We contacted the maker of this game and they told us that you have to score at least 11.000 points in order to beat the score of that Antonia girl. Each jump you make give you 250 points so you can imagine how many times you have to jump fences and fallen trees in order to beat the score. you get only 5 min. and you have to try to jump 44 times in that little time.It's imposible to beat it. We tried.No luck.Don't buy it!!!!!
3,Essential Guide to Yellowstone,"I bought this book along with the Top Trails Yellowstone and Grand Tetons and would up using this one more often. I was frustrated by one hike, though, when the description of the trail was insufficient and I finally turned back. The author should use terms like ""east"" and ""south"" instead of ""by the trees"" because there were trees in every which direction! It seemed at times that he was so familiar with the trails that he assumed too much instead of looking at it from the eyes of someone new to the area. It was good for organization of the trails and for helping me to figure out which ones to consider and which to pass by based on the time of year or the weather conditions."
5,Excellent hiking guide,This is an excellent guide to relatively short day hikes in Yellowstone. Provides good descriptions on what you will see on the trails and it's small enough to take along on your hike.
2,Waffen-SS Encyclopedia,"Not expect from this book an ""encyclopedia"", is more an ""aproximation"" to the Waffen-SS world. If you don't look for a detail information it may help you to know units, history, and the flow and ebbs of some personalities and units. A book for beguinners."
1,Disappointed,"We bought this cd to watch as a family on Christmas day, and my husband and I previewed it. It is not suitable to watch as a family. The couple makes out on the kitchen table and they also have foul language right and left throughout the movie. I highly do not recomend anyone from buying this to watch as a family! Very very disappointed."
3,Christmas in Boston - Cute but predictable,The film was cute. The backdrop of Christmas in Boston was a highlight for those of us who are crazy about Christmas! I like Marla Sokolof. Just felt the plot was too predictable and that is why I rate it at 3 stars.
3,Christmas??,"Not a bad movie, really, but so very little to do with Christmas. For many, Christmas means Shop 'till you drop. It's about buying gifts, not reflecting on the Christmas gift the world got.Still, if you've some idle time to spare, it won't hurt to watch it."
3,Good fit,"Good fit on my 3 series BMW, does not feel like leather, feels synthetic. I was expecting a more organic leather feel."
3,Bad fitment for 2003-2008 Toyota Corollas,Genuine Leather (which is the lowest kind of leather) but still leather. Looks good and smells nice. Feels good but just not a great fit for the Toyoto Corolla. Bad coverage. Attached a photo.
1,Please Don't Claim Genuine Leather,"Please don't claim ""Genuine Leather"". You are NOT!The product is indeed well made, everything looks nice. It fits my car nicely. However, I am cheated by the look. I always wonder it is not genuine leather (animal hide) like the seller claim. I finally got time to do a simple test. I cut the label coming from the product labelled ""Genuine High Grade Leather"" into two pieces. One piece is peeled the black cover, the black cover is rubber like can be stretched two times than original length, shinning in the lab light, the base is just another simulated leather. I burned another half, it smelled just like another plastic product. To be fair, the product is worth the price from any point of view except the claim genuine leather."
4,nice for the price,"This is a nice steering wheel cover. I'm not completely sure its leather but it feels nice. I read reviews where buyers are one starring this product saying its plastic and one even said he cut a chunk out for his to see if it was leather. I'm going to say this. If you want something that smells like top grain Italian leather this is not the product nor the price range you need to be looking for and it definitely isn't the expectation you should have if you paid less than $20 for a product. For that price you get what you get, regardless of what the manufacturer may claim. Reviewers on Amazon kill me with unrealistic expectations like products that are purchased at low costs like this one should be perfect and expensive grain leather is unrealistic and ignorant. A nice cover it is. Top grain leather it is not, at least not for $20. Want top quality? Spend multiples of the cost of this product! !!! I like mine and itinstalled in a snap."
1,Nowhere near as good as others of his,"I read Denis Johnson's Angels a long time ago and was impressed by this writer who I'd never heard of (yes, bad English). Then I read Already Dead, and it really impressed me! And then Tree of Smoke, which was even better (amazingly good)! So now Denis Johnson was my all-time favorite author (I think I've probably read about 99% of the best books ever written). I just read Nobody Move, which also really impressed me (light, fun, and beautifully written), and then Train Dreams, which was very good. And finally, I've just finished The Name of the World, and it did not impress me at all. In fact, I'd guess that someone offered Johnson money if he'd write a book, so he did. It's devoid of the beautiful language that his best books are full of, as well as the brilliant ways of looking at things and thinking about things that are in his best books. It's just a book. It's not nearly his latest, so I can still eagerly look forward to his next one."
3,Banality All Dressed Up and Nowhere to Go...,"Reading Denis Johnson's THE NAME OF THE WORLD, I'm reminded of the way Neil Young once introduced a new song to a long-ago crowd at the Fillmore East: ""Sorta starts off real slow and then it fizzles-out altogether."" Protagonist Mike Reed is so spiritually denuded by his tragic past and the insipidity of his present that even Johnson's often masterful prose can't give him life. The only surprise here, I suppose, is that there isn't one. The book doesn't know where to end, and, though only one hundred twenty-nine pages, drags-on for the last forty or so perhaps only to escape the dreaded ""novella"" status. In the wake of minor masterpiece JESUS' SON, this quiet and cold little book is a mystery to me. Why, Denis?"
5,you can feel the energy,This tape is sometimes used in our Qigong class and I wanted one for my personal use at home so I can reap more of the benefits.
4,Different than what I expected,Books are exactly on the topic I was looking for and as advertized. The pictures online were a bid misleading but this is probably my mistake not having a lot of time to research the books before purchasing.
4,Why so much bile?,"Why are the customer reviews here so arch and mean? ""Pity the Bathtub"" is hardly an obscure book. It is about to go into its third printing, and this I heard from the director of the Press that published it. On top of that, Harvey's book, along with a few other first books, have made the big NY Houses suddenly pay a little more attention to poets early in their careers due to the sales of these books. All that aside, this is a fine debut. And if use of language is the key to predicting a poet's career, Matthea Harvey will have a long and August one ahead of her."
4,excellent deal,"Very clear, small, good sound quality, excellent buy for the money. Be carefull when you remove the little screws that hold on the base. They are tiny and can easily get lost."
1,Not good,"Frankly, I'm embarassed for the authors. I have the second edition, and it is rife with errors. It just illustrates what a PhD is worth these days. I held out hope that the enclosed CD would have a spreadsheet of value (as it implies in the text) but all that is included is the book in PDF format. Thanks guys, that's helpful! Your next book should be titled ""How to lie on the cover about the contents"".I just don't know at whom they are targeting this book. Too basic for anyone in finance with a semester of accounting under his/her belt, maybe it's for kids in high school in Junior Achievement? People running Kool Aide stands?I think we all know the market -- their students who are hosed into buying it. Click another link to get away from this book as fast as you can, so my suffering is for a purpose."
3,A a good book which needs to be updated,"This is a good book which contains financial formulas and many examples of business analysis. The chapter on spreedsheets is badly outdated. This detracts from the book because business analysis is now all about spreadsheets. The short chapter on outdated financial programs detracts from the book. Their are other, better, books now available.To be fair, the book covers a very complete collect of business analysis precedures and still is a good reference."
2,Could be useful for beginners in financial analysis,The section on spreadsheet is terribly outdated - obsolete even. It's pretty much like a basic reference for financial modelling but does not really provide the step by step approach to the topic. Sorry but I don't think you will find useful tips on financial forecasting here.
4,Unreal,"I hope that some of you know that a Statham movie usually involves a hundred punches and gun fight almost no one else can survive. But once again I thought that the movie was great, simple story line and very few active characters. I hope that he keeps making these fun films."
4,Not bad,Typical Jason Statham flick. Lots of action w/ well choreographed fight scenes. You get what you pay for. Not bad.
4,Okay,"It is the typical Jason Statham movie and is what I expected. Lots of action, an occassional hot girl and he wins in the end. I'd watch it again."
3,No acting required,"When you see the name Jason Stratham on a film's credits you more-or-less know what to expect. Insane action, a man's man overcoming impossible odds. The reluctant hero with lashings of personal integrity and a heart of gold. It is an intoxicating combination, but unfortunately, as here, it can also become a played-out formula. What is disappointing is that I suspect Jason Stratham is capable of more; much more. He just needs the right script, the right director.So no surprises here. If you're a Stratham fan or just want a fast moving, action oriented and brutal adventure, then you've come to the right place. Certainly not one of his best outings but also not his worst."
3,SAFE,It's a action packed mover were the hard core goes over for a small girl. Who everyone eather wants for thier self or want to kill.I would give it a 3 1/2 star if i could.
4,Another great Statham movie,"We expected this to be just another action flick, but it grabbed our attention from the start. The plot and twists throughout kept us guessing, and made this one of the better Jason Statham movies. Definitely recommend!"
4,Safe,Movie was OK but it seems to be like all his movies. Do not regret the purchase but am a little disappointed.
5,Yngwie's masterpiece,"Yngwie Malmsteen's first album, note by note. A classic of neoclassic rock and metal, a masterpiece. Contains big part of all his techniques and some extraordinarily nice melodies and harmonies, ""easy"" to learn with tabulature. A must for every rock and metal guitarist!"
3,A bit loose and a bit thick,"I use these to protect my hands from doing a million pushups on concrete at my outdoor bootcamp. And they work for that. But I find that the pull-on style feels too loose while I'm working out. Paradoxically, I find them difficult to get off after my workout without turning them inside out and having to tediously turn each finger hole right-side out again. I also think that the padding on the palm is a bit too thick. Like I said, these work fine, but I like the pair of gloves I had previously from Gaiam."
4,Great cakes inside !,One of my three top books for special occasion cakes! Wonderful. Strongly recommended for the more than occasional baker. Bravo - plus!
2,Some great... some not so great... not for the noice,"Some of the recipes are amazing, some are downright... awful!You need to know your techniques. Some of the recipes are correct, some or not. You may run out of buttercream on one, or have too much on another.Rathaus torte, AMAZING, everyone's favorite.Zuger Kirschtorte, made with loads of Kirschwasser, tastes like medicine!!! Probably one of the most disgusting things that has ever come out of my kitchen. And with company coming, I am going to have to make a back-up cake, since this is VILE.Buy the book, if you know what you are doing in the kitchen, and TEST before you serve to guests."
1,Overly complicated recipes,"This book knows nothing about simplicity. It is filled with time-consuming and complicated recipes that just are not worth it- even if you follow the instructions. I have made 6 cakes out of this book. Only one of them was really any good. The cakes just aren't good enough to warrant spending the time. The Townhall cake takes 3 days to make all of the parts. I did not think it was all that good. (It looks quite amazing) I made a tastier cheesecake from the cream cheese package recipe. Yeah, there is some history on each of the recipes. That's kind of special, for about 5 minutes. What would be more special is an author that had spent the time to simplify the recipes so that good results could be had without following complicated instructions (that either are so finicky that they don't always work, or aren't very good no matter what you do.) You will find my copy for sale in the used editions section."
4,Show Stopping Cakes,The cakes come out picture perfect and taste fabulous. I agree with the other reviewers that a certain level of baking experience is needed in order to understand his directions. Beginners could find this book intimidating. Some of the cakes are time consuming and expensive. I would not use those recipes for commercial baking but they make great party desserts. The kind of desserts that build a baker's reputation
4,Best choice for scanning tablets,"I bought this scanner to scan hundreds of old newspapers. I have a duel booting iMac computer. Everything works great in both Mac OS and Windows, except for the included OCR software. It does not work on the Mac computer. Not a big deal for me because I can scan in Windows, but something to think about if you want to use this scanner on a Mac. I read on some Mac support forums, that this is a known issue and the only solution is to upgrade the OCR software (which cost hundreds of dollars). If you use a Windows PC, no worries. Other than this issue, it's a fine scanner and the best large-format scanner in is price range."
2,"Buy ""The Lark in the Morning"" instead !","""Marrowbones"" is a superior compilation to this one, as it has significantly more tracks. A few of the tracks on ""First Steps""(odd title) are taken from Tim Hart`s and Maddy Prior`s musical collaborations, and not from any Steeleye Span album. I would suggest you get the double-CD ""Marrowbones"", instead, as it contains almost all of the tracks from the first three Steeleye albums.- UPDATE -This is an update on earlier comments. A new compilation, ""THE LARK IN THE MORNING:THE EARLY YEARS"""" is due for release later this month and, for the first time ever, ALL OF THE FIRST THREE STEELEYE SPAN ALBUMS(in their entirety and in the right track order too), will be available in a relatively inexpensive 2-CD package.Price-wise it works out at nearly a quarter of what I paid for these three albums on separate CDs!"
1,Why?,"I do not understand why this movie has not been put out on DVD for Region 1. This is an excellent movie that would appeal to many military film buffs. It just does not make sense that they put out 50 or 60 year old TV series that were junk when first aired, but something of quality never makes the cut."
3,Not as Strong as you would expect,"Tracy Lawerence has to be one of my favorite country artist. I almost bought this album new. I would have not been happy to have spent $18 on this CD. It is a good album, and if you like Tracy, well it is a better than good country album. The song that help me to buy the album was Paint me a Birmingham. It is a super song, but with the exception of maybe 2 others, there is just a lot of genric type songs on this album. Strong was an alright song. Stones would probably be my second top song on this album, and notice you have not heard it on the radio. Only buy this album at a full price if you love Tracy. It is a good album for less than $5. Thanks"
1,Thanks. I salvaged the drive and trashed the enclosure.,It is obvious from reviews here that this unit is beyond all hope. But there is a very standard hard drive inside the enclosure. I took out the drive and it works OK. I've trashed the enclosure and I won't even try to troubleshoot why the usb connection won't work like it's supposed to. Thank you for saving my time.
1,worst kurt cobain bio ever written !,"all i have to say is that this book it terribly written, and completley biased. every page has a comment meant to degrade or tear down kurt cobain. i think it is written in an immature way and the guy who wrote it CLEARLY has absolutley no respect for cobain or his music. (ie, starts the book by saying ""went upstairs and blew his brains out"" - which is entirely not neccessary.)GO BUY HEAVIER THAN HEAVEN instead (charles r. cross), which gives a great, extremely truthful, account of kurt's whole life in an amazing way.don't even bother with this biography! it's a total throw away. help youself by moving on to another page now."
1,Poorley writen.,"I think it was very poorley written. One minute they were talking about him and the band, then the next they were talking about his childhood. I think the authors should put the facts in order."
1,A horribly written protrait by a prejudiced author,"Besides conatining information which seems to be untrue, this book is written horribly. Skipping all around, it confuses the reader. The book does go deep into the past of Kurt Cobain, but there is an ominously present trait in the entire book of disapproval of Kurt Cobain. This is not a book written by an impartial author, but one who chooses to showcase his dislike of Kurt Cobain."
2,Not the best book on Cobain to read.,Hi. I didn't really like this book. It wasn't based on facts it was more like 'well we think this and....' It also portrayed all the negative things about his life and death. It has some interesting pictures in it though. Some I didn't like. Example one of a tabloid magazine about Frances. Some pictures were good though. Overall I don't recommend reading this book.
4,Storyteller's Guide,As a Personal Historian and Genealgist I understand the importance of preserving family stories that have been told and retold. The authors state that these stories are perfect material for the storyteller and it is so true. The authors do a good job of explaining how to shape and create stories and follows right through to memorizing and presentation. A good read.Vickie Chupurdia: #1 Best Selling Author - Jumpstart Your Genealogy ResearchJumpstart Your Genealogy Research
4,A Simple Story for Girls who like Pink,"The Fuchsia is Now is a simple story about a fuchsia-colored girl who has a birthday, receives a special present, and meets a fuchsia-colored fairy who grants Fuchsia's wish.My five-year-old daughter, whose favorite color is pink, thinks that this story is great. The illustrations, which make the characters look a bit like space aliens, make it easy for kids to tell the story by themselves without having to know how to read.Although the story line is a bit too simplistic for my liking, little girls who like fairies and the color pink will probably enjoy this book just as my daughter did."
1,Slaughterhouse on the Eastern Front slaughtered,"Slaughterhouse on the Eastern front came with so much promise but from the typos, spelling and grammatical errors to the REPEATING of whole large paragraphs in the book (Never seen that before)to the absence of division listings (For example, no mention of the Muncheburg or Kurmark Divisions-why?) it was a let down.Don't buy this sight unseen.The book is a great idea but doesn't deliver on substance."
1,Slaughterhouse is Shallow and Not Very Useful,"If you know much about the Eastern Front, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK! Although its advertising makes it sound like it is a thorough, in depth book on its topic, it is a actually just a shallow grab bag of random facts. A lot of its material is freely available, in greater detail, on the Web. Some of it is available in much greater detail -- Slaughterhouse's section on weapons, for example, is so poor you have to wonder why they bothered to include it.Your money would be much better spent on something like the Oxford Companion to World War II. The Oxford Companion has a different emphasis that Slaughterhouse, but it is comprehensive, and includes all of the war.If you don't know much about the Eastern Front, this book may have some value. But, I still recommend the Oxford Companion instead, plus the free material on the Internet."
5,A great read,"I found this book absolutely delightful. The author did a wonderful job of delving into topics that are generally spoken about, and ze did a wonderful job of painting an undiluted portrait of butches in general. A must read for all, especially parents with butch daughters."
2,"decent memoir, problematic as a gender critique","Some passages enlightening and insightful, however falls into the misogynist mindset it seeks to criticize. Reinforces the gender binary and stereotyped gender roles it attempts to upset by re-appropriating them and applying them to lesbian women (by categorizing/simplifying lesbians as either ""butch"" or ""femme"" --which is somewhat invalidating to lesbians who do not identify as either. If I am not ""a butch"", I must be ""a femme"", if I am identifying as a lesbian and vice-versa. This seems to defeat the whole purpose of inventing the ""ze"" and ""hir"" neutral pronouns)"
3,"Great paint, poor shipping","Thanks to Amazon's shipping department, these paintballs all arrived broken. Instead of surrounding the paintball case with packing material, only one side was covered with airbags, the rest was right against the box. So, I give the paint a five, but Amazon's packing a zero, or a three overall. Buy this paint, but don't buy it from Amazon."
1,Lame Game,"VR Troopers, a high-tech beat-em-up type game, is one of the games that are OK. There is a weak plot revolving around three teens trapped in a virtual reality video game. Your can choose to be one of the three heroes, Kaitlin Star, Ryan Steel, or JB Reese. You can also play as one of the bad dudes, Tankotron, Decimator, Kongbot, Dark Heart, or Magician. Each has their own special moves which are pretty cool. I don't know...I guess Sega lost its touch on this one."
5,Excellent overview of the history of airborne surveillance.,"This book gives an in-depth look at air borne surveillance starting with the planes and cameras of WW II and ends with the techno-marvels that are flying today. It should appeal not only to the high-tech crowd, but also to students of recent history, for it describes how the knowledge collected by planes and satellites influenced the course of political events. Deep Black is a wonderful blend of technology and history and is very well written"
2,Not terribly impressed.,"This is my least favorite of several MJ cookbooks I ordered at the same time. I noticed at least one recipe where an ingredient was missing. Also, be prepared for cheesy poems and such mixed in with recipes throughout the book. I've already given this book away 'cause it is no keeper."
4,Subtle and Delicate,"Intricacy (Master Class) evolves into a mystery as electronica pulsates from your headphones in a sexy melancholy (Honey) and then dissipates into a haunting acoustic mystery (Super-Dooper). Until Angels, this becomes very relaxing. Norah Jones is hardly recognizable. The music then turns very moody and slowly slips away into a subtle soundtrack background ambience. The mood setting elements are very apparent throughout the selections.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Bad diapers,"After bringing up 4 kids, and trying out a lot of different brands of diapers, I think this is the only one which I strongly feel will not buy again.it leaks, and the velcro is too tiny , and keepc coming off."
2,the radium machine works on shrinking people,all it is about is a bald headed dr named dr. cyclops that created a radium machine that reduces people to one fifth their normal size
3,Helpful as a starting point...,"Product contains interesting information about history of sheet music in America. It also gives an idea of past price points to help value your old music. I am just starting out, so this was helpful to me. The book came exactly as promised, very fast service."
5,Oxfod dictionary,This dictionary came in excellent condition and is a gift to a child who does not have access to a computer. I feel everyone should have a dictionary. Thanks
1,Didn't have the one thing I needed,I purchased this dictionary for the expressed purpose of confirming or learning the exact division of syllables for words I use in lyric writing. Also neccessary is the location of stressed syllables (or accents). This dictionary did not have these features! Two features that even the most fundamental dictionary would have.
4,Not exactly what I'd hoped for...,"I am an English major and getting ready to go into a Master's degree. I had done extensive research on concise OED's and thought this one sounded the best. I was really hoping to get more backround info on words and more complete definitions. Perhaps there are too many words and just not enough pages! I am still happy to have it and have used it, but it is better for Boggle than anything so far!"
3,Practically indestructible..but..,"I bought this summer 2008 from Target. I've dropped it many times and the cd player continues to function. Although one of the drops killed the radio. The earphones that came with it were uncomfortable, so I boughtSkullcandy S5LWBZ-BC Lowrider Headphone, (Black/Chrome)a nicer set.Unfortunately, you can't turn the skip protection off and I believe this is what sucks down batteries like a barely 21 year old drunk girl sucks down shots at ladies' night. What, you thought I was going to say something dirtier? Nah. Also I kinda wish the battery compartment wasn't under the cd itself, I'd like to change them out without taking the cd out. I will buy a different cd player soon, it's pretty banged up."
4,Happy! Happy!,I ordered this CD player with AM/FM tuner to replace an old Sony Walkman that I had for at least 10 years. Could not find a similar one in stores and was so glad to find it on Amazon. It is exactly what I was looking for. Hope it lasts as long as my other one!
1,I recently bought this CD walkman and it was a total waste of my money!,Am very dissapointed with the performance of the Sony D-FJ041 CD walkman.The sound was not very clear. I did not return it because I had to practically destroy the package to get it out. I'm very unhappy with this purchase and will discourage anyone from buying this product.
3,Good & Bad,"On the plus side, this unit has excellent memory function. I use it to listen to audio books intermittently so have to turn it off and listen again when I have the time. When I finally return to listen, it starts where I left off the last time. Good! Sound is good.On the negative, I discovered only if I literally took out the batteries (in between listening periods), could I get any longevity out of the batteries. Seems even when not using it, the batteries are being depleted somehow.Also, would have appreciated a belt clip on the bottom as I listen while I'm working on projects and move around quite a bit.Good CD player for the money but with some not-so-great asides."
1,Died after 9 months,Sony only gives a 90 day warranty. That's how much they believe in their product. I've bought a bunch of Sony CD players w/ radio. Now I have 3 CD players that broke but their radios still work. I'm careful with what I put in them and in general how I handle them. This time I've finally wised up. I'm buying a 2-year extended warranty for my new Sony CD player. It will die for sure before 2 years. Be smart and buy an extended warranty so you don't throw your money away.
4,Does the Job,"I bought this product a year ago, primarily for audiobooks,and have liked it very much, specially because I had previously bought a couple of drugstore cheapies that ate up batteries quickly and broke down within weeks. It's true that the battery compartment is poorly placed and the controls are just so so. However, I love how it picks up just where I left off and it's been totally reliable. I just bought another one because I expect that sooner or later it's bound to fail -- likely at a cliff hanger. For the price, I don't think it can be beat."
4,Schuetzen Rifles,"The book arrived within a couple of day of the order. The book was in the condition listed. Service could not have been better. Content of the book was a bit disappointing, but this had nothing to do with the seller. I now have a definitive guide on one series of Schuetzen rifles, but, alas, the rifle I own was not one of the ones listed."
1,Don't like it,It doesn't work at all for me. I don't know why but I really dont like it. It also came late .
5,"Quiet, compassionate, and useful","Barbara Bartocci addresses an issue that baby boomers will soon face: the death of their parents. For many, unprepared to become the ""older generation,"" the experience will be traumatic. It may also be an opportunity for spiritual growth. Barbara uses personal experience (she has lost many loved ones) and discussions with others to point up a wide range of reactions-from feeling a parent has died ""too young,"" to grief that lasts beyond the ""acceptable"" period of time, to guilt arising out of relief at the passing. She validates all these emotions and gives valuable insights, as well as warm, sometimes humorous advice. In a sense, NOBODY'S CHILD ANYMORE can be used as a handbook. It is a practical reference as well as an uplifting lesson for difficult times."
2,I don't pay money to watch previews!,"I love The Tick itself, but no one should be fored to manually fast forward through ten minutes of previews every time they want to watch a few episodes. Not if they are paying 25 dollars for the privelege! I could just as easily have just rented this through netflix virtually for free. As it stands I doubt I will watch through it more than once or twice.If this is as annoying to you as it is to me, then be warned."
4,Great Player,"GREAT Player am ordering several for Christmas gifts for family, GrAndchildren and friends. EASY TO USE AND EASY TO CARRY."
3,So-so performances by great actors,"It just isn't the best performance from amazing actors. Not intolerable, but my husband fell asleep. The supporting characters carry the film, Anthony, Charlotte & Laura in particular."
2,Where's The Beef?,A waste of 117 minutesA self absorbed work of monumental disinterest.Omar Metwally is just not likeable. Why the women in this movie have any interest in this milksop is beyond me.I kept looking for some kind of climax to the never ending psycho-babble and finally found it in Omar's splay footed run to his lover's arms. You'll have to wait till the 116th minute but it is a hoot.
5,Well Worth the Price- A great new guidebook,"I ordered this book from Amazon a few weeks ago and read it at sales meeting I just attended. The author has some excellent presentation ideas that I plan to use during my sales calls this season. Perfect for the new sales rep, I too, a long time salesperson, found this book to be an excellent addition to my library. I'm sure this book will be big seller."
2,Bland at best.,"This book refers to the psychological impact of games, or rather, it tries to. Author Steven Poole even admits to not enjoying playing games, so what business does he have writing a book about them? Somewhat informative, but very dry. Print quality is also average--The pictures look as if they were photocopied in a convenience store."
4,History Comes Alive - Lots of Action,"The action in this book was very real. I could almost feel the tension of the battlefield and the fear in the hearts of the men who were fighting. Reminded me of Braveheart or the Gladiator but the visuals were all in my head - so much better. Though the author is a woman, she understands the hearts and minds of men. She brought her characters to life - both women and men - even her love scenes had an edge to them. Not too sappy. My only criticism is the length of the book. At 600 pages you'll need more than a weekend to read it."
3,Not bad,"The picture of this item is somewhat deceptive about it's size. What's not apparent is that there are 10 or 12 inches of pure (non-rubberized) cloth on either side of the rubberized portion. I guess this thing was designed for someone who sleeps on a twin bed with an incredibly thin mattress (cloth sides are supposed to be tucked under?). It's not exactly what I was shooting for but it works fine on a small bed for a small boys' occassional mishaps. It's rubber instead of plastic, so no crackly noise - which is good. I put a no slip mat underneath it (just in case) and it stays in place. Wouldn't recommend this particular design for anyone who rolls around much during sleep, has larger than a twin bed or an adult sized bladder."
1,What a Disappointment,This is a five CD book. The author does not actually begin discussing the battle until well into the FOURTH CD. Need I say more?
2,Fodor Ireland,Found it difficult to find specific information on specific locations. Would be OK if I were reading it cover to cover but to find specific info it was difficult. Index needs to be better.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I own the basic ELBT595 and a total of 3 handsets. I have NEVER been able to link any of my cell phones to this thing. Bluetooth is a great concept for use with this small phone, but the batteries die within half an hour or so when using bluetooth. Batteries in general last only about 6 months and after which standby time goes down to about 24 hours."
3,Great product BUT,This is a great product but I wish I would have know how old it was. An example of this is that it uses Bluetooth 1.1 and for the most part the rest of the world has moved to 2.0. It was difficult to find a headset that was 1.1 compatable.
3,Great features ...BUT,This flip phone has so many great features that are so easy to work.You would fall in love with this phone and never want another ...IF...The hinge lasted more than 3 months and the phone would work more than 30 feet from it's base. What a shame. The paging...private calling...2 way..great ringer selections are so easy to use and the nice blue light and flip features are great. Too bad they seemed to give up on it. I have owned 8 in the last 3 years all have the same short comings.
1,Rip Off,Software will NOT work with windows Vista. Blue-tooth does not work with iPhone. What a waste of money!!
4,works great with other handsets,"I got this base and added 6 TCX805 handsets to it. The whole setup works great. I got this base because it supports bluetooth through to my cell phone. That features works well, there's a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that's trivial. I will say this, you need to keep your cell phone within about 20' of this base. I just take mine off, turn on Bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base.So if you want the cell dialing feature and like the more traditional upright handset, get this base and expand it with other handsets."
2,"Very, Basic.","I'm a fan of Kris Wilder, and have read several of his books. I thought his work to be insightful for Martial Artists, especially for those of us who practice Goju Ryu. 121 Killer appz. I think not. 121 elementary applications are more like it. I was not thoroughly impressed and found the applications to very basic. This DVD is not on par with his other fine works."
4,Stocking stuffer,"I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. The item shipped quickly and is as described. It does come in a folded square without the rubberband. I guess I should have ""assembled"" it for him since he had no idea what it was!"
4,book,"This book has a free easy and loose approach to watercolor painting. It's a nice book to have and lots of good information regarding ""how to"" and ""why."" Yet encouragement to paint what you love and how to design it."
4,"Nice jacket, runs small","Got as a Christmas present for my coal miner hubby. He said the sleeves could be a little looser and longer. I bought him a 3XL bc he's a tall built guy. He wears it, though. It's held up for one year, but needs to be replaced. It doesnt hold up good in rough work. But would be nice for a road worker. I would buy it again for my brother."
2,Lots of inaccuracies - so-so CGI - kids might like it anyway...,"Maybe I'm not the sort of person this program was made for, and yes it is understood that programs like these are based purely on conjecture, but when the inaccuracies are overwhelming (notably, the Spinosaurus episode) you have to wonder what the point is. Each program is basically the same as the next, and since the individual shows are very repetitive (showing the same scenes and making the same statements over and over again), you're going to snooze after a while. I'm sure your kids won't care too much (unless they are discriminating dino fans and will be annoyed by the inaccuracies), but adults will be better served by the ""Walking"" series or any of the History Channel dino specials. As it is, I am very disappointed in this program."
5,great book,"i LOVE this book. its soo, so so good, ive read it countless times. and forget what other people say, the rape scene was essential to the plot, andf a reality in those times. its a beautifully written story with wonderful characters. its almost as good as ashes in the wind. i highly recommend it"
4,Darkwing Duck Rocks!,"Although the episodes are not in chronological order, i still loved this box set. Darkwing Duck was my favorite cartoon as a kid, and as an adult, he seems even better. I was suprised at how much I can relate to him, even now. But like i said, It's a shame that the episodes are out of order. It's because Disney had seasons 1 and 2 runninng simultaneously on different networks, so they put them on the DVD by air date, not story."
2,average,"This is not a bad book at all, its actually a pleasant read but I was looking for real detailed chow specific info and this is not it. The author has a lot of experience with dogs but not specifically chows. This book is not a waste of money but my search for a serious breed specific chow book will continue."
5,What a pleasure!,"A sweet,hope-filled story that was a pleasure to read. The story moves along nicely, no bog downs, and was a quick read."
2,Basil Rathbone,"I was looking for Sherlock Holmes starring Basil Rathbone. Only 4 of the 9 episodes feature Basil Rathbone, the other five do not feature Basil Rathbone. So if you're looking for all Basil Rathbone look elsewhere, but for $5.99 what the heck."
5,Pefect for a tall glass of Iced Tea,"My husband is an iced tea addict. I bought these spoons for him for his birthday and he has used them everyday since. They don't look like much, but we have been very pleased. They are weighted just right and work great for stirring chocolate milk also."
3,Iced Tea Spoon,Haveing found itwas improssible to find iced tea spoons in the stores in my area I ordered these because they are very resonably priced. I am very happy with this purchase.
3,I'd like for it to be longer.,"We're already big fans of Cesar Milan, so his message isn't a surprise. What was a surprise, and a disappointment, was how short this DVD is. We have several seasons of his Dog Whisperer television program on DVD, and each of those DVDs contains three to five times the content, measured by time, as this DVD does. And, a season of Dog Whisperer is three or four DVDs to boot.If you've never seen Cesar speak or work with dogs this could be useful, but you'd be better served to buy Dog Whisperer Season One and get far more information of his methods."
2,Interesting,"I bought this for one reason and one reason only - Johnny Rivers' song ""The Ballad of Hopalong Cassidy."" I'm a JR fan so this was essential to the collection. The rest of the stuff is O.K. I know that sounds cruel, but like I said, I bought it for the JR song."
1,I Might Like It IF.........,"In the fine print it says ""The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players."" This should be in bold face, bright contrasting colors on the cover! I have numerous different CD and DVD players and it will not play on any of them. This is very disappointing as I can't seem to find a ""normal"" format of this album."
4,One smooth Christmas collection,"Here is a fantastic mix of soothing songs that will really set the tone for an easy-going, relaxed conversation filled holiday evening... The first time I played it...our guests all asked about it..saying they loved it. Another time we brought it with us to a Christmas party..& ended up leaving it there cause the host couldn't get enough. I subtracted one star...because song # 15. I think it detracts from the mood on this CD..in fact it sticks out like a sore thumb & really doesn't even blend in. It is sung by a guest soloist....not one I've heard of or enjoy either.With Christmas once again right around the corner...we're ordering another copy & plan to let it work it's magic again this Christmas...& for many Christmas' to come. If Connick is one of your favorites...this one won't disappoint you..& if he's not yet...he'll likely have quite an impression on you too."
1,Very Disappointing,I like Harry's voice generally but this cd is really disappointing. Most of the cuts are too brassy and Silent Night has been turned into a spiritual.
1,"More Cajun than Christmas, take a rolaids when you listen","Rate it A for awful. Love most of Harrys work, but this is pure pooh. Listen before you buy. OOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWeeeee it sure be bad."
3,Pretty good,"Streets of Rage 2 is a stage by stage fighting game with bosses at the end of each stage. You can choose your character from three choices and each has a different special move. It can be beaten in one sitting; it took me over an hour to do. Overall, I think it is well worth the price."
3,ALOT better than Gameboy's crappy version,"This was a pretty good verison of MK1.It had the blood and the gore,via a simple cheat code plus it's gameplay and sounds were decent too.This was such a better portable version of the game,than what Nintendo put out on their Gameboy.The graphics on here still look pretty good,although they are not perfect.But this is Game Gear.Only negative thing,is this version is missing Kano.Overall,this is a good portable version of MK1.Pick this up along with MK II,if you own a Game Gear."
5,This is really Kimberley?,WOW!! I can honestly say that I wasnt a huge fan of her on American Idol...but I bought her cd anyway. WOW! I can't stop listening to it. There are so many different types of music making this an eclectic and excellent cd. Coulda been is by far my faviorate..I am so happy for her
1,lackluster sales prove CD is not good,"I read an article in the paper yesterday about the disappointing and lackluster sales this CD is generating. I'm not surprised. I listened to my friend's CD who is a fan of Kim's and found the material too banal and trite. Her voice is husky and not to my taste (my opinion only). Kim Locke sings over the top in every song and more is not better. If her producers would find the right songs for her to sing with decent production values (which are horrible on this CD), and adequate promotion the CD sales would be doing better. Just like Justin Guarini, Tamyra Gray and Fantasia, this CD is not living up to expectations in regards to sales. After all, it is all about THE MONEY in the music industry. These poor kids are having their hopes dashed for a piece of fleeting fame. A piece of advice: Fame is fleeting. Don't pursue it. Stick to your dreams but don't sell or compromise yourself in order to attain that dream."
2,Not Very Impressive,"I find Kimberley to be very talented. Yet out of the 12 songs on this album, there are only like 3 or 4 goods songs like ""Have you ever been in love"", ""i could"", ""without you"", and ""somewhere over the rainbow"". The rest of the songs don't show off any talent, and you can find them on any other r&b album."
2,Give this woman what she deserves ...,"God bless Kim Locke. An amazing talent. Stuck with producers who don't get it. Take ""You've Changed"" ... remix it and throw this woman on radio to put that real star on her path. Period. Most of the CD is filler, but I will still buy #2."
1,Not worth Buying,"If you consider buy this CD, think again. The CD is full of below average songs. The singer's talent is very limited and the song choices are not good at all. By the way, you can listen to most of the songs from many online music websites now and also from many radio stations. There is really no need to own one."
4,I'm surprised... this cd is good.,"Okay, I have never been a fan of Kimberley Locke, but I must admit that I am surprised by this cd. Here is my breakdown of each song on a scale of 1-5:1. 8th World Wonder- catchy pop song (4)2. Have you ever been in love- rock/pop (3)3. Wrong- soft rock {think Christina Aguilera} (5)4. I could- pop ballad (4)5. Without you- pop ballad (5)6. It's alright- R&B (4)7. Coulda been- R&B (4)8. Before- pop ballad (5)9. You've changed- R&B (4)10. Now I can fly- R&B (4)11. I can't make you love me- remake of a Bonnie Raitt song (3)12. Somewhere over the rainbow- (3)My overall rating for this cd is four stars. I am sure that we will hear a lot from Kimberley Locke in the years to come."
2,Voice is good but songs arent so hot,"The single released 8th world wonder is pretty good. The Clay Aiken duet is not bad, however the rest isnt so good. It has nothing to do with the voice or singing, its just the songs. The song ""Before"" reminds me of Kelly Clarkson's ""Before Your Love"" and its ok sounding. The version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow is remade and doesnt sound like the one that was put on American Idol classics volume 2 cd. Totally remade. I think she has nice pleasant voice, but should have got better songs to showcase it. The song You Have Changed isnt bad more and R & B style which what I thought cd would show more of."
1,sorry kim.....you were great on AI....but....,this cd absolutely blows...8th world wonder is an ok pop tune...and the rest you can throw away in the crapper.
4,Enjoyable..,"This is the first of E. Baverly that I read. I love the way she develops the plots; even though the inner thought of the characters sometimes drove me crazy. interestingly enough it is not boring AT ALL, like some of the similiar plot I've read from others. And I really enjoy the side love story of Rosemary and Natheniel....ohhhh.. it is so romantic and I think this story by itself should receive a full 5 stars. At the end, it is a very enjoyable read. I am seriously considering her ""how to trap a tycoon""- sound hillarious!"
2,BEWARE--mine cracked too!!!!,"I LOVED this thing, but about the 10th time using it, I heard a ""pop"" and later noticed a huge crack completely through the stoneware. Unlike other reviewers, when I called Kitchenaid for a replacement, I got some third-degree-like questions such as 1) What were you cooking at the time of the ""pop"". 2) Do you always put liquid in the cooker when you cook? 3) What did the pop sound like?...and other such nonsense which kinda ticked me off. They are going to send a replacement, though, so we shall see."
3,"wonderful, but","The KitchenAid Slow Cooker worked just the way it was supposed to with one major problem. ( I have only used it once.) The directions emphasize that the ceramic insert cannot be refrigerated and then heated in the slow cooker. That is why I bought the item - to make enough for leftovers and/or to start a recipe one day and finish it the next. So I refrigerated it anyway and, at least this time, there was no problem."
4,Great cooker..,Though I had a problem because the lid did not lay flat..called KitchenAid and they were very polite and helpful in explaining that was by design so that some of the pressure can escape.Several meals later can confirm it works like it is supposed to - clean up is a breeze
1,DO NOT BUY KitchenAid Slow Cooker-- Repeated cracking of Ceramic insert.,"I purchased the KitchenAid Slow Cooker in Red and its been having problems since I first purchased it.I have had it for nearly 2 years---I might have used it a maximum of 10 times and the ceramic has cracked 3 times.I do not recommend this product.KitchenAid will not replace the part, nor will it provide any kind of credit.This is certainly the last time I will purchase anything from KitchenAid--TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.Up to this point I was a BIG kitchenAid consumer--but no longer.Save yourself the headache and DO NOT BUY THIS!!!KitchenAid KSC700SS 7-Quart Slow Cooker, Stainless SteelComplete JUNK!!!"
1,Never turned on!!! Just when I needed to use it!!!,"Bought this cooker last week, washed it and put it away for this night when I had to have 3 cookers going over night for a party. Good thing I came back and checked it an hour later. It never turned on. Checked everything. Light on, heat is not. Also, the lid leaves a big gap in the seal and it does not fit air tight at all. Very upset and dissatisfied."
1,Kitchen Aid Slow Cooker,Kitchen Aid Slow CookerThe unit developed a crack in the crock that goes inside the cooker within 10 minutes of turning it on for the first time. Several other buyers had reported the same problem but my wife insisted on buying the unit. We just packed it up and sent it back to Amazon.com. I also sent an e mail to Kitchen Aid to tell them that they should not allow their good name to be damaged by selling such poor products.
4,Hummer of slow cookers,"Big, expensive, versatile.I bought this because I wanted a slow cooker that would turn itself off. Mysteriously, I've had to chase this feature through multiple crockpots that ended up on ""keep warm"" instead of ""off"".This one turns off after 12 hours. Hallelujah!Serious heating element gets crockpot up to cooking speed in a few minutes. Has 'buffet' setting for extended keep warm session[note: buffet setting does not turn off]. Claims to cook small amounts safely[I haven't tried this]. Puts error code up if power went off during cooking.Did I mention it is huge?January 2008 addition:I did try the crockpot with a small amount of food in it. It worked but the chuck was so exposed to air the top started to look seared. I turned it over for the last hour and it was saved from crustiness. I won't try this again- I think the 3 quart line is the minimum."
4,Good Quality,Very good quality and the finish is also good. Like the colours of case being close to the colours of phone. Good value for money.
5,Knife in a box,I goth this for my wife who is a keen scrapbooker but was always complaining that her craft knife had no top to keep it safe. The knife set is very good with a range of blades that can easily be slotted on. Because it is Xacto you can get new blades everywhere and the box keeps everything safe but easy to get at.
4,Works great,"I bought this at the last minute for a quick stencil project. The swivel knife worked great for that. Haven't used the other two knives yet, but the set looks great."
3,Not very useful.,"I wish more publishers would appreciate that music is something that takes effort and dedication. You can work hard and learn it the proper way or just play by position and not learn any note reading at all. The book is ok for someone who already knows how to read music. But if you want to learn note reading, or something serious, forget it."
2,Not for beginners,"If you're a beginner, then I don't recommend this book. It has plenty enough pieces to play, but the book does a terrible job of explaining the notes and chords and how to read music. Don't buy this book unless you just want a lot of practice pieces and don't need any information on the notes and chords and how to read music."
3,SHIPPING COSTS!,"Well folks, here's the catch - I found out at the last minute before checking out - the shipping and handling is about $30!!!!! Perhaps this is still a good deal at at total of $66 instead of $36 as it appears at first glance - but that sure puts a damper on the anticipation that you're going to get this nice little item so cheap. At $36, I wouldn't even bother to comparison ship. At $66, it might be worth spending some time to see if you can get something just as suitable, but new, for a little bit more."
2,"Ear Buds, not worth the money","I kept buying these ear buds for my teen age kids, and every time they broke I'd buy another pair, at $25 a pop that added up. Finally one day I bought an extra pair for myself and I realized that they were really crappy! I can only hear from one ear and I hardly use them and I don't abuse them. I wear them on the treadmill or elliptical trainer at the gym.I think you can get crappy ear buds like this one for $10 at the store or much better ones for $25. Don't bother with these. Oh yeah, I did like the case. Perhaps they should have charged $10 for the ear buds and $15 for the case!!"
5,Happy with this purchase!,The product helps me stay organized. I can find it in my purse/briefcase easily. Received it in a timely manner. Very happy will this item.
2,Disappointed,"I'd just got done reading One Kiss From You and was looking forward to another fun read. I nearly didn't get past the first 50 pages because it was such a scene for scene rip off of the movie ""Sabrina"" -- yup, should have read the other reviews here first *sigh*. Anyway.. I figured I'd go along and see if it possibly got any better (read, different from the movies I love). There were some twists and turns along the way, but it really felt like the whole thing was just grafted on to that storyline. I really wonder how it made it through to publication. I'm hoping the other few Dodd books I ordered are better than this... if they're not, I'm liable to stay clear of her stuff in the future."
2,"Tsk, Tsk, Ms. Dodd","While her writing is superb, as usual, thus making her one of the best of the Romance writers,it is a no-no to so obviously recycle plots. This plot is a direct steal from ""Sabrina"" a wonderful movie (1954)starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. Unfortunately, this version does not compare favorably."
2,Not very original,"I am wondering if Ms Dodd was under some sort of a deadline and needed to get a book out. Totally lacked in originality with an almost character-by-character scene-by-scene remake of Sabrina. It is hard to enjoy a book when there is no suspense at all as to what will happen next. I guess if you never saw the movie, you would enjoy this, but it is hard to imagine there are too many people out there that missed either the original or the remake. I really liked the other Governess books but this does not really even tie into those. Very disappointing."
2,Just go see the movie,"While I am a great fan of the movie Sabrina, I assume writers will come up with their plot lines. I was greatly disappointed to pick up what I thought was a new story to discover that it instead was Sabrina with a few cosmetic changes."
3,IN MY WILDES DREAMS,"I LIKE CHRISTINA DODDS BOOK AND LOOK FOR NEW ONES ALL THE TIME.I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN I STARTED READING IN MY WILDES DREAMSBECAUSE IT WAS JUST LIKE THE MOVIE ""SABRINA"" WITH HARRISON FORD, JULIA ORMND, AND GREG KINNEAR. LOOK FOR THE MOVIE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF HOW CLOSE THE ARE. IT WAS STILL A GOOD BOOK AND I AM GLAD THAT I DID FINNISH IT."
4,Good for small home networking,"This router was a breeze to setup and use. Overall, it works pretty well for home networking with my two desktops and laptop. One thing I noticed about it is whenever I transfer a large number of files in between my networked computers, the throughput seems to lag down dramatically after a long period of time, which can be fixed by a reboot of the router. Kind of an annoying glitch, but other than that, it's been pretty solid."
3,Rook 100th Anniversary Edition,"Cards were supposed to be tournament quality cards. I don't feel like they are any better than the sets you can buy at the stores, not like the older 80th anniversary sets that were real tournamnet cards. Still they the cards are fine to play with but just not what I expected."
5,great cable,"i wasnt expecting much for the price of the cable, and being that the longer it is the worse the quality of the picture is transmitted (or at least supposed to be). but i was very very surprised to find that they work perfectly. i have a 40 inch flat screen plasma and i watch movies very often from my laptop. the quality is very good!"
4,Good price,"Now that is a fair price for just a piece of wire. Those dirty money hungryscumbags Charging 35.00 for a 6' piece should be cracked in the knee with a small pipe wrench, Or given a medal, I mean there are a lot of stupid people out there."
2,"Worked great, but stopped working after about a month","These are cheap cables, so I guess you get what you pay for! It's a gamble when you buy off brand cables, and I took that gamble. Worked awesome for a month and then nothing. Good luck"
1,This HDMI cable is not working.,"Doesn't work at all. Poor quality. I connected it from my laptop to a TV, no pictures what's so ever. But if I changed the cable back to my old 4 feet HDMI cable, everything is perfect. Absolutely sure the cable is the problem. Tried many times, also different HDMI ports, never worked."
1,Noise in the Picture,"I ordered two of these 15ft HDMI cables because there were numerous positive reviews and the price was very low. When they arrived, I plugged one in where I had temporarily put a 6ft HDMI cable. Immediately, the picture began to include noise. Every so often, a whole section of picture would flicker with no information and then back to normal albeit still noise filled. I tried the other cable and the same effect occurred. Finally, I replaced the 6ft cable I had bought on Amazon years ago, and the picture returned to normal."
2,Not good. Picture full of moving speckles.,"I am using this cable to hook a MacBook Pro to my TV. On all black / scenes of uniform color there is a very noticable amount of moving speckles (""snow""). When using another brands 6' cable the quality is fine, so I assume it is this cable or its length. This cable is unusable for my purpose."
4,HDMI CABLES,I PERSONALLY PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR INSTALLATION OF OUR FLAT SCREEN TV. I AM SURE IT WILL SERVE ITS PURPOSE WELL.
5,No need to pay more,"hooked this up from my yamaha receiver to my hd projector.I have a denon dvd hooked up to the receiver and using the thx setup on the star wars movies I first used my 100 6 foot monster cable and then this cable.There was absolutly no difference, this cable fit nice and tight in both holes. Sometimes cheap cable just dont fit ""right"". If you need a long cable buy this one"
1,William Huong,"Stan Cotton is the William Huong of authors. This book ""bangs"", ""it bangs"".... Please buy this book if you have an uneaven coffee table (prop under short leg). This book could be worste, no wait, it could'nt be worste; no wait, it could be, if it were a hardcover and if Stan added 1 more page. I would rather buy a book on ""cats that paint"". If this book were .01 cent at the library, I would buy it and burn it. PU what a stinker. This book should come with a warning.. ""Caution, This Book Sucks Donkey""."
4,Wonderfully fresh and filled with memories,"I had an uncle Matt, everyone needs a person in their life like my uncle Matt. He always had a fresh scent coupled with a good nature. As uncles go he was perfect with a bit of mischief on the side. Gabels was his after shave and he purchased it from his barber in 16oz bottles. Whenever I splash on Gabels Bay Rum I enjoy the compliments from not only my wife but from friends as well. Today when someone asks about the fragrance I give them a small bottle filled with with the clean scent of Bay rum and great memories of a much missed uncle.PS. I bought the Gallon size.Gregg"
5,Power Shower,Gone are the days of low-flow filters where the shower head shot pressurized mist. The Sprite filter and head combo feel like you're taking a regular shower. Awesome. And a bargain.
3,Nice Spray,"I have only had this about a week so have used it about 7 times. I did not add the little piece that makes you useless water since my association fee includes my water useage. Without that being added the spray gives a powerful spraywhich I do like. However, as far as feeling my skin being any better or smoother it is the same as it was. I liveoutside of Detroit so maybe we have good water. I have MCS so try to stay away from as many chemicals as I can."
2,Not like Easy Rawlins...,"The story begins will Paris Minton who is a successful bookstore owner until he meets Elana Love. Within 24 hours of their initial meeting, Paris is beaten, his store burned to the ground and robbed. Paris enlists the help of his friend Fearless Jones to help him find Ms. Love and who burned his store.After, the first few chapters of the book the plot becomes very confusing and difficult to read. I had to actually force myself to finish. Fearless Jones was about 100 pages too long. The last few chapters in my opinion seem more a rush to hurry up and tie things together. The only reason why I finish the book was to find out who burned Paris's store.Fearless Jones and Paris Minton were well-developed characters but with a weak plot they just didn't stand out like Mouse and Easy Rawlins from Devil In a Blue Dress. I hope the next Fearless mystery is shorter and better than the first. --JeT"
3,"Not Feeling ""Fearless""","I'm a huge fan of Walter Mosley, but ""Fearless Jones"" just didn't do it for me. Too many characters, too many twists and turns, all to end up very simply, leaving the reader with the feeling that the book, and mystery, could've ended and been resolved 100 pages earlier. Fearless Jones is no Eazy Rawlins..."
4,Walter Mosley does it again,"When I read the jacket for Fearless Jones I immediately wanted to compare Paris and Fearless to Easy Rawlings and Mouse. The characters seemed to be the same: straight and arrow and the wild guy with L.A. as a backdrop.I have seen the errors of my ways and have gladly welcomed Fearless Jones into my library. Paris Minton is literally minding his own business when trouble in the form of Elana Love comes walking through the door. As Paris and Fearless search for Elana they get caught up in a web of lies and thieves searching for a lost treasure.Set in the 1950's Mosley delivers a great period piece. The characters are developed and they feel ""real"". Each page left me wanting more. If you are looking for a good mystery and are tired of the same cookie cutter factory drivel that seems to be the norm, here is the book for you."
3,Terrible sound quality,I've got the DVD and the sound quality is almost intolerable. I expected some hiss but this is nasty.A bit too much camera is expended on Argerich's face too.
2,"unable to use data disk,","The book arrived in good condition. However, the data disk arrived with viruses. I am very disappointed. I cannot used the disk. My money was refunded, but I still cannot use the data disk. I am very disappointed with Amazon. Sincerely, Gretchen Peoples"
2,joy o joy,I THOUGHT THIS ITEM WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE I HAVE.I REALLY DID NOT ENJOY IT'S CONTENTS. MAYBE NEXT TIME.
1,worst product ever,"The inside cover might make the game look good, and along with the low price, it seemed to be a good deal. But don't let it fool you. The game is awful. The characters look stupid and theres countless amount of bugs that go with it. If you raise, they'll fold, so its almost impossible to get to the next level. Go spend your money elsewhere, this game should be deemed ""Worst Game Ever."""
5,OMFRACK!,"I can't even begin to fathom in my head how awesome these headphones are! When I got them, I was pretty weary, I kept reading reviews about the warranty being bad and how ""heavy users"" were having problems breaking them. I've had mine for at least three months and I'm super happy with them. I've been careful not to tug on them too much, or pull them out of my pocket. They've been great so far. The ONLY problem I have is that fact that the volume gauge is too easy to slide out of place. When I'm on my bike, I put the cord through my clothing and the volume gauge goes crazy; sliding up and down my chest. Even when it's not in my shirt, if I were to brush up against it with my arm, the volume would increase....so yeah, buy these headphones!"
3,"Great sound, poor wiring. Two pair down","I've had two pair of AKG K-27i. I handle them carefully and use them while riding a city bus. Pair #1 left channel went out after 8 months. Pair #2 right channel cuts out after 10 months. The ear cups are sealed so the loose wiring can't be fixed. Throw-aways. The excellent sound quality, portability and comfort don't make much difference when they don't work. Poor construction."
5,Great lightweight portable item,"I love these, they are very lightweight and quite comfortable, the sound is good, and they seem well made. They fold small enough to fit in my jacket pocket or small compartment of my bag. I use them almost daily and they've held up so far."
3,"Good, but don't buy this. Wait for the uncut.","Other than the fact that this anime was censored in numerous places, Kite's pretty enjoyable. You have your assassins with messed up pasts, sweet over-the-top gunfights, and bloody messes. And, to set this anime apart from others, you have exploding bullets, vehicles that fall through numerous floors, many cats, an exploding basketball, and the best part, the ridiculously long (and messy) public restroom gunfight. Would you expect all of this mayhem to be accompanied with a soundtrack done entirely with a peppy saxophone? Well, that's what it is, and it just doesn't fit. This anime is cut in many places and the dialogue is edited a bit to cover the missing scenes up. A director's cut version is available in Europe, so buy it if it ever comes here."
5,I'm glad this is the director's cut,"Kite follows a young assasin named Sawa. Orphened at a young age she was taken in by a police detectives and trained to kill professionaly. This title is not for the squemish, mixing violence and sex it still has a great story with a cast of sickenly fascinating characters. I highly recomend this title but be warned this anime is prone to bring on severe bouts of depression."
4,"Good, could have been better","I agree with many of the reviews in regards to the length of the movie. With a more fleshed out script, we could have explored more of Sawa's past and training - but I certainly would have liked to get at least a glimpse into the past of Oburi (since he's a pivotal character and all). The action sequences were quite refreshing since they were well choreographed and didn't feel as ""clean"" as most action sequences I've seen. That is, the characters fight in a ""catch as catch can"" style that may even seem sloppy at times. The main problem I have with this story is the absolutely awful costume design of the characters. I would rather not have seen the detective wearing a headband or ugly checkered tie. And Oburi looked like an X-games reject. Sawa at least got a rather typical schoolgirl outfit, but that's the whole point of her being a killer in disguise.All in all, I'm glad I bought the movie. It's definitely against the grain of most anime I've seen lately."
3,Way too short,I really liked this movie. As I watched it I was really getting into the story and the characters. The artwork is beautiful and some of the action scenes are incredible. But just when it starts to get really good the movie is over. This movie needed at least another hour to fully develop the plot and characters. There's a little love story between the girl and a murderous young guy but it never gets explored. There's also a connection between the girl and her parents that never get explored. This story has so much more to offer but there is simply not enough time to do it in this 45min movie.
2,Can the action sequences SAVE it??,"There are so many movies out there that have the POTENTIAL of being so much better... I think this is NOT one of them, though it may have seemed to in the opening scene (the emotionless girl wasting someone with her handy hand-gun, hops off a building rooftop into the mist of the city in an almost graceful, superhero fashion). However, the end result of this film is an edited sex movie that has a bunch of extremely violent scenes linked together by what? I'm not sure, but the numbness of the characters pretty much coincides with the numbness of the viewer. Though I did enjoy the gun-to-gun combat (vs. hand-to-hand) scene in the subway near the end (almost like The Matrix, but more over-the-top), it's not worth it to keep... I sold this one after buying it... you decide. If you want bloody action for the sake of cool bloody action, ok, you've got it."
4,Very Deep and Entertaining,"This is not kiddie stuff at all. The story centers around a girl ""recruited"" by a secret organization to assasinate criminals who escape from the flawed criminal justice system. Trouble ensues when the girl falls for another killer and begins to question her career choice. It's bloody, violent and great!The animation is very good, the characters are well developed and the pacing of the story line is just great."
3,If it was 2 hours it would have been Great.,"I watched this movie dubbed on VHS. The story is interesting, basically two crooked cops recruit kids to kill criminals that they can not get evidence on to convict. There is a lot of intrigue and bloodshed. This movie is very gory and not recommended for children, there is also some nudity. The major short coming for this movie is that is only 45 minutes. The plot is to rushed and it comes to an abrupt ending. Hare-core anime fans won't mind this, but I wouldn't recommend buying it because you feel cheated since the movie is so short. Longer anime features are much better as in ""Ninja Scroll"", ""Ghost In The Shell"" and ""Princess Mononoke""."
5,Nuts and Bolts and Eye Opening Stuff....,"I bought this book not because I was planning to become an Independent Publisher, I thought it would help me plan an effort to use POD (Publishing on Demand).Reiss DOES cover POD AND at the same time she opened my eyes to seeing how simple and straightforward it could be for me to become my own publisher.She took away the mystery with her step-by-step, no nonsense ""Peanut Butter and Jelly"" approach. I am busy enough: I don't need extra fluff.I appreciate this: facts, facts and just the facts and there are LOTS of resources for me to check out as well, more than enough.Reiss' writing style is clear, friendly and not-guru-like at all.In fact, I like it so much I am going to buy more of her books. She tells it simply, clearly and understandably.Its not rocket science: didn't think it was.It is something I will try now. Thank you, Fern Reiss."
2,Okay,"This game is okay but what I hate about it is if you look in your scrap book before you complete all the levels, only the first two pictures show up!! It is very boring and too easy. It's not really what it was made out to be."
4,Heavy Duty,Well made. Everything fit perfectly. Recommend locking pin to keep it in your receiver. Lot easier to keep in the hitch than a ball that reaches out and grabs you at every opportunity. Hopefully I will be more of a puller than a pullee!
3,Offspring??,"I have actually never seen the movie, but the soundtrack is pretty freakin' cool. Unfortunately, the CD does not have a song I am looking for. The Offspring did a cover for the Ramones, ""I Wanna Be Sedated."" Someone told me the song was in the movie, is this correct? If not, where did this song come from?? It's not on any of their albums. If anyone knows anything, email me at .... Thanks!"
5,3 story books,"Lobve it! Like having the 3 stories in one book. They are classic!They were written for the time, yet are timeless. A must read."
4,Helpful,"I bought this book and it came as another edition that the dealing made a mistake or another edition was unavailable to purchase. However, for my needs it worked out fine."
3,TM,"No flying in the house Written by Betty Brock, is a book about a three year old girl, a three inch dog, and an old lady named Ms. VancourtAnnabel a three year old girl, and Gloria a three inch dog that could talk and do many tricks, were found by Ms. Van court outside on the street. Ms.Vancourt bring them home and told all her friends about Gloria. Belindia was a magical tiny golden cat that told Annabel a secret that her parents didn't want h errs to know. I liked the end when Annabel's parents came backend everyone turned out to be related even Ms.Vancourt.The author's message is if you love someone and you're doing something that's keeping him or her away you should stop doing it."
5,Absolutely Love This Book!!,"I absolutely adored this book when I was in grade school. My daughter is 9 and we are now reading it again. It's amazing how well this book held up over the years, and it was such a joy to read it again. I actually still have my copy from when I got it back in the 70's, although it's very fragile now. I ordered another copy for us to read so I could keep mine safe.Highly recommend this book. It's great for young readers, and it's smart and intelligent. I enjoy when my daughter reads books that are written on such a higher level, and require some thinking."
1,useless,"this product is a complete waste of money. I bought it thinking that it would make the impossibly hard task of peeling a pineapple much easier, but I was wrong. First of all, the ""blades"" on the bottom are not sharp AT ALL, , which results in you having to push down so hard that you end up smashing the pineapple and squirting juice all over the counter top.Also, the twisting motion, combined with the amout of pressure required caused my wrist to hurt so badly that I had to stop and ask my husband for help.In addition, when you finally get to the bottom of the pineapple, you end up with the core part wedged into the cylinder, and no way of getting it out. It did not just slide right out like I thought.After assessing the damage, I would say that about 30% of the edible fruit was wasted, becuase the pineapple was much bigger than the size of the peeler, plus all the flesh that was smashed and stuck in the core.Save your money and just peel it with a knife!"
2,Crushed Pineapple!,"I have only used this once but am thinking of sending it back, but will give it another try first. I was so excited to use it but maybe I did not use enough pressure. The first two inches got perfect but the rest ended up crushed. What am I doing wrong?"
3,"Better than a knife, not by much","Though fairly quick and easy to use (if messy, but that is not the fault of the slicer), I found the ""give"" of the plastic to make it overall a bit less efficient than I had hoped. I would definitely go for a non-plastic variety if I had to do it over again (in face there are such options that are cheaper somehow) but it's not so bad that I'll pitch it."
4,Pineapple corer does the job,"Overall, this product works very well. There is some waste on the bigger pineapples, but in return you retain all the juice and most of the pineapple is sliced quickly."
2,eeehhh...,"Perhaps it was me, perhaps it was my pineapples, but something wasn't working according to Hoyle. I had some difficulty getting it to go through the pineapple. (Yes, they were ripe!). Also, there was a lot of pineapple left in the pineapple shell for this frugal old gal, so that meant some tedious knife work to harvest the remainder. Finally, this device caused lots of wasted juice. Regretfully, my opinion, even though I am the minority, is to use a knife in the first place. I rate this pineapple slicer eeehhh..."
3,"Obvious, Immature, and Foolish - But...","Women may enjoy the romantic, hopeful elements of the story. Check the reviews on this movie. Everyone is correct. Obvious, silly, with a screenplay that sounds like it's written by a high school male - performances are broad and cartoonish. All participants are a stereotype.However, on closer scrutiny, the real villains in this movie are not the conniving men, but the shallow, bitchy women. One frustrated clown, articulates the theme - surrounded by beautiful women, he cries out that he wants a mannequin. That is, a kind, woman who can nurture. That's the irony and the romantic appeal of the movie. A nerd lucks out by finding love with a beautiful phantom soul.I should know better, but I like this movie."
1,Description said nothing about specific region,I have ordered many items from Amazon.com. BUT this one takes the cake! Nothing in the item description said anything about this DVD being for a specific region in order for it to play. This was a Christmas gift and we have tried it in 4 DVD players and NONE of them will accept it :(
1,Bad design!,"This cable does not have the little keys on the device connector, and it is constructed with pins on the top and bottom of the connector. What this means is it's possible to connect the cable inversely which could do serious damage to your phone and/or computer!I would *strongly* advise against buying this cable. It is very likely dangerous to your devices due to the bad design.It also does not click firmly on to the phone, the retaining clips on the cable are constructed poorly and do not work. The item shipped is not exactly as pictured, whatever that little booklet looking thing is was not a part of the shipment.Complete waste of 5 bucks. Not worth the cost to ship back for a return. This item will be going in the trash since it might get plugged in backwards and destroy my 350 dollar (replacement cost) phone."
4,"sed, awk ... useful tools","sed and awk typically get a bum rap from perl users. ""why learn sed or awk when perl can do both?"" yes, it can. and so much more.but what if you just need to print, say, the first field of a file? or just replace a few characters in a stream? what about the situations when you dont have perl handy (ie a freshly installed IRIX box)?the sed & awk book is *the* standard. it's not written by anyone famous or whatnot, but it does a fantastic job of covering the basics, the meat, and advanced uses of sed and awk (and variants).if you spend time on the command line and need to know a few quick tips, this is the book to have for sed and awk. you'll learn regexp material, how to use sed and awk and a bunch of useful routines.highly reccomended for UNIX shell geeks."
4,"Come for the sed, stay for the awk!","This book is a timeless classic, the information on sed is invaluable to anyone who regularly works with text files or streams (after all sed is short for stream editor). Not only is it very informative it's also a fun and easy read... You'll be seeing uses for sed almost every day once you learn how powerful it can be!The last 1/2 or so is on awk and although it's also very well written and informative it's not quite as useful if you're already experienced with a high level language with excellent text processing facilities like Python or Perl. However, it's work reading even if you keep thinking ""I could do this in _____"" because sometimes awk really is the right answer."
3,Wuthering Heights,A large part of the movie has been cut out. I have the VHS version and there are many more scenes. I was disappointed that it has been cut. That should have been specified and I wouldn't have bought it.
1,WORST MOVIE,"I PERSONALLY THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST AWFUL MOVIES I HAVEEVER SEEN, NEVER MADE ANY SENCE, NO STORY LINE ,"
3,NOT A BOOK,"This is NOT a book. It is a CD. Please do not read the ""Book review"" as this is actually an AUDIO BOOK."
1,Montgomery misses the point,"Montgomery and Myers omit major points in the analyis of responses surfaces. No where do they mention the concept of expected mean squares, or nested factorial designs. This book may be adequate for an engineer, but for a serious mathematician, it is not at a sufficient level. If you found this book lacking, try Skillings and Webber's book: Experimental Designs."
3,Remixed in the Garage?,"Since I am a bit of a purist, I really only liked the one remix that sounds like the original theme overdubbed with some drum machines in the garage. Has a nice added beat. Otherwise, not really worth adding to your ""soundtrack collection."""
5,Wonderful,The book is in great condition just as the seller description. It was sent out on schedule and recived in a timely manner. With the service I have recieved i will be doing business with the seller again.
3,Attractive Shoe but not comfortable,"This is an attractive looking shoe that I receive many compliments on when I wear. I purchased it in the red which is deep in color, almost crimson. The red looks great when worn with jeans. My only complaint is they aren't the most comfortable shoes (usually the cute ones aren't), when worn for long durations of time."
3,"Interesting Plot action packed, ending needed work","Action packed, some special effects, ending needed some work. Pre-colonial periad Europe was the settings and a twist in magic and which craft."
3,pretty good,"I would have given 3 1/2 but of course it's either 3 or 4 stars,it was a pretty good movie."
5,A surprise,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. The acting is superb . James purefoy is awesome as the main character. A must see!"
1,The Curse of Kane,A weak tale full of digital effects that are nothing like the pulpy energy of the great Robert E. Howard Kane stories. Do yourself a favor and read The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane!
2,Disappointing,Poor acting from a good actor. The cinema part was very darkly shot and made it hard to see what was happening at times.
1,All the elements but still lacking..,This movie had all the elements of the great fantasy movies but it didn't hit the mark. Maybe it was made for a younger audience.
2,Meh.,"Move itself was a let down. Boring and a half-assed attempt at what could have been a real good flick.The Amazon Instant service, though, was excellent. Great quality and I'm glad I didn't waste a trip to the theatre on this thing."
1,Faithless,"The only relationship this movie bears to the Solomon Kane stories of Robert E. Howard is the title. Everything else has been changed, and most decidedly not for the better."
1,Awful,I had high hopes for this movie. Choppy disconnected story. I lost interest half way through but stuck it out hoping for redeeming scenes/pick-up in the storyline before the end. I was disappointed.
5,Good movie,I rented this movie through Amazon and I was not disappointed. I will be adding this movie to my DVD collection!
2,just OK,"acting was pretty poor, would not recommend it to many better shows out there to watch. pass on this one and look for something better"
2,Meh,"This is one of those movies that should have worked but didn't. It lacked that certain something needed for a great movie to shine. While it was stocked with great actors it didn't seem to me they were given much to do and the script felt perfunctory. All in all, a solid meh."
4,Solomon Cane,"COOL! Pretty good flick; worth every cent- bet you'll watch it 2-3 times. Great story, FXs etc. Sort of Van Helsing-ish. Check it out you wont be sorry."
3,Not terrible,"Better than the Conan remake but not up to big budgets action standards. Overall this wasn't a terrible movie, fun weekend movie."
4,Better than you would think,"Considering I never heard of this movie, I would have thought it was bad acting and a bad story. I was wrong, it is definitely worth the money to see."
5,Clowns friends or foes?,"If you live in a trailer park, you may never go outside at night, or leave your blinds up at night again! Or, if you visit a carnival, you may never go in a spook house again, or look at a clown the same way again! This story was excellent! I could not put it down! The main characters which are two little girls grab your attention and don't let go! This book is really creepy! I think that this is one of the scariest book that I have ever read. This book was actually scary! It takes a lot to scare me and this was one of the books that you think about late at night while you are in bed. One of the main characters India, is disturbing and creepy! Believe me, you won't look at clown dolls the same again! This book has both mystery and horror! Even though it is bascially about kids, this story is intersting even for adults! This is not a kids book, it is a twelve to adult book. Do your self a favor and get this book today!"
3,In Cold Blood,"I didn't like it - but I think I might be the only one. In Cold Blood follows the the story (by the same name) written by Truman Capote. The film invites us into the criminal's minds and acts through some pretty sensational black and white shouts. However, parts of the movie very much began to drag and Brooks almost, it seems, begins to gorge the audience on the main characters. Before too long I found myself more than full of the dragging plots and character development."
4,Adds a nice little twist to The River expansion,"This expansion is nice if you like to play with The River; it adds a new element (the fork) that makes the start of games more interesting. I also want to applaud Rio Grande Games on it's packaging - the box that this comes in is no bigger than the tiles stacked themselves, and the (simple) instructions for how to use it are printed on the side."
3,Something's missing!,"I can't believe they came out with a Greatest Hits album and left off Forever Love from the Mo' Money soundtrack. Forever Love definately competes for their best song. They should have also considered Slow Motion and Time and Chance. With only 12 tracks to start with, the selections seem to be a little thin."
3,"A ""nice"" collection","This is a very ""nice"" collection but it doesn't get 5 stars due 2 the fact that I felt some good songs were missing.but it's still a good collection though!"
5,Surprisingly great,"Being mainly a guitar player, I wouldn't touch Ernie Balls with a ten-foot pole. I've tried them enough times on different guitars, both acoustic and electric, to know that I don't like them at all. Had more bad experiences than I'd have time to explain.However - these were given to me and I figured I'd give them a whirl. Free strings couldn't hurt, right? Well, three years later, the strings are still on the bass, and just recently I changed them due to intonation issues. The tone mellowed out to a nice warm thump, with a bit of articulation still remaining. I'd estimate about 40-50 hours worth of playing on these strings. I do not store my bass in a case.Wouldn't hesitate to use again if I were in a pinch. I would like to try other bass strings to see what is out there, but I don't regret using these at all. They lasted a long time and sounded good all the while. Very impressed."
3,"Okay, but jack handle tore it up","This is a cheap cover, something I knew when I bought it. I have a jack on my trailer tongued that rotates in a horizontal plane at the top of the jack so the handle hits the cover every time it rotates. Eventually, it wore a big hole in the front of the cover."
1,Losverture,"Schubert: Symphonies 5, 6, 8 & 9; Rosamunde Overture brought about by Herbert von Karajan on this CD, sound plainly uninspired and a bit negligent. He seems to be mocking the German aura, and giving Schubert back to the Austrians.Is this a charity concert?Die Wiener Philharmoniker sounds better than the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra here."
2,One Thing Going For It,"In A Perfect World...Abduction starts out with great promise but then the `can't-stand-each-other-but-can't-help-myself"" that is so typical of romance novels takes over and the story takes a turn for the worse. Relationship issues are resolved just because. A psychic gains and loses her psychic ability. A very mousy woman suddenly develops courage with no setbacks.Its saving grace is its mysteries: The missing man and the serial killer."
2,Read Along But No Help on when to Turn the Page,"Isn't the idea behind a read along to help pre & early readers learn? There is no tone or anything indicating when to turn the page. This is very frustrating for my son who just turned 4 and received this as a birthday gift. Generally he loves these books. They are a great quiet time activity that he can do alone and they foster early reading skills. BUT...without helping him know when to turn the page it isn't any help at all, and he needs constant help. We do a lot of reading together, however, I intended this to be something he could do on his own. A BIG disappointment for both of us!"
5,Kidz Tunz Christmas Carols 2,"I have been a music teacher for years and have much experience working with children in church and this is, by far, the best Christmas sound track I have found. It has upbeat songs that can be used in a variety of ways, from plays to background music and more. I love this CD and mine is so scratched up I'm purchasing a second."
1,CRAP!!!,"I preordered this item and waited months before it became available. I loved the features: baby monitor, 2-way radios, blue tooth, VOIP capable, flip phone, etc. I paid over $500 for the base unit & 3 handsets. At this point, the only feature we can use is the speaker phone on the base unit. 1 year after we had them, the first one broke at the hinges. I contacted Uniden but our only option was to pay almost the cost of a new one for repairs. It wasn't a month or 2 longer and the other 2 hinges broke - it's just cheep plastic. We don't even have children yet - these phones were never abused. The phones are about 1 1/2 years old now but 2 won't work at all and 1 will only hold a charge for a single 30 minute phone call. I though about replacing the handsets or even trying new batteries at $22 a pop but, for the cost I think I'll opt for a new phone set. This was my first and my last uniden phone."
4,uniden elx500 5.8ghz bluetooth phone,compact design bluetooth enabled for hands free headset no problems at all just sensitive to to physical damage like driops or water. can easely be broken as long as you take care not to drop or spill liquids it should last a long time. this is the best phone ever i wish they kept improveing on the model instead of discountinuing it.
2,"So much promise, so little quality","This was a great phone for a while. We bought it for our daughter to use until she was old enough to get a cell phone but my wife and I used it as well. The problem with the phone as several people have pointed out is a weak hinge design which after a couple of years just broke. No traumatic damage--one day the hinge just popped apart and there was no way to fix it. Too bad, it was a very nice phone before that."
5,2nd album: much better,"This album is much better than their debut. It's good soul music and not just teenage bubble gum. There are decent producers on it like Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Come And Get Me is really catchy. The girls grew up. It's a shame that they lost their contract after this album, but people were probably too disappointed with the first album"
3,Well-thought design is better than iSkin...,"...but it needs a screen protector! Every time you take your iPod out of a case and put it back in non-stop, you're going to scratch it. At first, only barely-detectible fine, tiny scratches, that soon build up to a cacophony of scratches. Ideally, you want a case in which you almost NEVER remove your iPod. If you have a dock, this is the one to get, because you don't have to take it out of the case to dock it. The bottom section swings out for dock access while the most vulnerable-to-scratching parts of your iPod remain covered by the rubbery skin. Unlike iSkin models, these have no clips. Also unlike the iSkin, there is no screen protector, and that is truly shameful. The one place the scratches will show up at their worst is on the screen. This model is for 3G (Third generation) iPods with the four buttons above the scroll wheel, not for click-wheel versions."
3,DVD/VCR Combo,"The product worked well out of the box. Couple of complications. The audio for the VCR is mono and separate from the audio from the DVD. The resulting wiring arrangement has to be inventive. The TVGuardian only works on the DVD side even thought you can get CC from the VCR. That said, TVGuardian is currently undergoing changes and this is one of the only ways to get it."
2,Hunting,Not what I expected. Teaches you nothing about using the calls that are sold with the video. Good if you just want to watch some coyote hunting with electronic calls.
3,Somewhat disappointing.,"Although I love The Broadway Kids, this CD was disappointing. Almost every song followed the same basic structure: a short solo followed by a chorus. It sounded more like KidSongs rather than The Broadway Kids. Very few vocalists truly got to shine, although I was quit eimpressed with Jillian Bowen, James Johnson, and Cassidy Ladden!"
4,Good,"I didn't really like the songs on this CD, but I was really impressed with a couple of the vocalists. One in particular, is Kate Kahanovitz. She has an amazing voice, but seems to have been overlooked quite a bit. I have heard her sing on Broadway and she out sang all her competion. I wish that she would have been featured more. But, she (and a few other of the kids) are what made the rate this CD so highly. Young stars in the making..."
1,Let me off this plane,"Imagine getting on a crowded transcontinental flight and finding that you're seated next to a middle aged man who, after a double Jack Daniels, wants to regale you with dozens of his favorite war stories. Now you know what reading this book is like.A good editor could have made twice the book out of this with half the padding. The pace isn't just slow. It's narcoleptic. DeMille is a great writer who isn't on point with this one. It's amusing in spots, but mostly it's a lo-o-o-o-ong plane ride seated next to a bore."
5,Great Story with Historical Geography,I just finished this work and thoroughly enjoyed it! A great tale with historically accurate Vietnam military history. I could not put it down.
1,Demille is getting worse instead of better!,I loved the Charm School and the Generals Daughter but was completely disappointed with his last book. I made the mistake of thinking the next one couldnt be worse....it is!!! Maybe its because I am not a Nam vet! I felt Up Country read like a travel guide instead of a mystery....really disappointed. This will be my last DeMille book.
2,A,"I can understand Mr, DeMilles need to work with his own Vietnam traumas, but why share it with us?. Maybe other Vietnam veterans might like it, but as a Dane never been in Vietnam, I dont like it.The story is not one of the best and the characters not really believable, the plot was not convincing at all. The book might be usefull as a tourist guide or history book, but as a novel it was a big disappointment. I like the other novels by DeMills, but really not this."
1,couldn't finish it,"I found this book in our condo-complex library in Maui and thought ""Up Country"" might be about Maui. It wasn't. It was about a grumpy old U.S. military has-been who has been re-called to solve a thirty year old army murder in Viet Nam. I thought,""sounds interesting...I like the concept."" But the war flashbacks were tedious reading. Then this woman appears at his table in a Viet Nam restaurant and proceeds to throw herself at him. He appears to forget why he is in Viet Nam from then on, letting himself be driven around on her motorcycles/ scooters while she shows off her driving as he cowers on the back seat. The book then limps on as the two characters become duller and duller. Not to mention scummier.So I stopped reading."
4,DeMille and Vietnam,This is vintage DeMille. There is abundant humour and plot resolution. It is really two stories.One is a murder investigation which brings our protagonist to Vietnam. At that stage it also becomes a Vietnamese travelogue with many reminisces by our investigator of his Vietnam War years. This takes up at least one-third of the book with stirring flash-backs of the war.Our investigator of course has a female accomplice as they both journey the length and breath of Vietnam. The different characters encountered (include the lead female) add to the smoke and mirrors feeling of the novel. Mr DeMille gives a vivid portrayal of Vietnam during the war years and our present day.At slightly over 700 pages I did find the book lengthy - are these writers paid by the page or kindle space usage? Nonetheless a very entertaining read and due to the Vietnam content - illuminating.
4,Going back!,"I served in I Corps from 11/66-06/68 and 03/69-12/69. I have no intention of ever actually returning to 'Nam but have often wondered what it is like now in South Vietnam and what happened to the South Vietnamese who weren't able to leave. Nelson DeMille's descriptions went a long way towards answering that. This would be a good read for anyone who wants some idea of what it was like to serve there.Aside from my admittedly personal fascination with the backdrop of the story, I found the development of the inital ""mystery"" to be slow but there was so much else going on that that actually only made the story more interesting to me. You knew, while reading, that there was a lot more to the case than what was initially presented and it was intriguing to watch it unfold. YMMV but I'd give it a solid 4 stars.Oh, and for the record, I want to know what happened to him after he returned home."
4,Up Country,"It's really 4.5 stars....nothing is perfect! Although Plum Island was close! For those who are not Nelson DeMille Fans (or have not read his novels), Up Country is typically (and that really means superb) Demille work. DeMille is true to his characters....if you have read ""The General's Daughter"". The suspense, the depth in characters, the detailed descriptions of the events that happened during the times of war....it all made the Viet Nam experience so close. For those of us who were not there, we felt grateful. For those of us who were there.....we gained some insight on what we were entangled in (perhaps not by choice). It was an enlightening experience to read DeMille's thoughts on a subject that was of great controversy no matter which side of the war you stood on. He gave life and feeling to something only a few really lived through and understand.Nelson DeMille is a master at his craft. Up Country is quality DeMille work...a book that provokes thought and many other emotions."
2,Disappointing,"The first few chapters of this book will really hook you, but then it goes downhill fast. I had a hard time finishing this story. This is definitely not one of Demille's better works."
1,Wait for the paperback,"Unless you enjoy spending money on a mystery and then reading hundreds of pages of inane travelogue, I'd wait on the paperback.For fans of Plum Island or the General's Daughter, this does not approach either in terms of punch, mystery or enjoyment. I could have edited 300 pages out of this boring book easily."
2,200 pages past boring...,"Make no mistake, the main character in this book isn't Paul Brenner, it's Vietman. There is so much ""backdrop"" in this book that it takes over.The ending is unsatisfying. The journey is unsatisfying. It's one thing to get bored with a book; it's quite another when you actually get frustrated.I have been a fan of DeMille's in the past, but if he wanted to write this book, perhaps a nonfiction tome would've been more appropriate."
2,"Bloated, too long","This book started out wonderfully, but dragged on way too long. Definitely not one of his better books. 'Nuff said."
3,"A moving, but long journey","I can see why this is a good book for people who served in Vietnam. The descriptions of events that happened are very vivid in this book. This book is light on action, and heavy on the introspective ramblings of Paul Brenner (from ""General's Daughter"").Paul is accompanied by Susan Weber who knows more than she lets on. This is a problem because you never truly knows where she stands. They are faced with having their privacy invaded and being hounded at every turn by Col. Mang, who seems to have it out for Paul.Many things are left unresolved in this book, which I suppose is good if you are looking to write a sequel. But it would have been nice to have it all tied up at the end. I kept waiting for something to happen in this book. Everyonce in a while someone would be killed, or they would find a clue. But it isn't until the last 50-75 pages that things are kicked into high gear.An enjoyable read, but not one that kept me glued to my chair."
1,Up country,I still have not received this book. I am very frustrated as I wanted to give it for a birthday present on Dec. 10. Here it is Dec. 8 and still no book. But you have certainly charged me for it. This is completely unacceptable. They sent me a tracking for the book and it was shipped out of Atlanta on Nov. 26th. Where in the world is it? We are 45 miles from Atlanta. What do you plan to do about this mess?
1,Gong Ho,"A travelogue review of the war in Vietnam, with an unbelievable premise and a prima donna ""wise guy"" narrator.Not up to DeMille country."
2,Waiting for the Typical DeMiller Thriller,"Up County turned out to be a bitter disappointment. Paul Brenner (reprieving his role as a U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer in DeMille's book, ""The General's Daughter"" ) took us along with him on his journey back to Viet Nam where he served during the Vietnamese conflict. He is now with the CID (Criminal Investigation Division) investigating the murder of a lieutenant by his commanding officer which took place 30 years ago during the Tet offensive.If I had wanted a graphic depiction of the horrors of that unfortunate war, I could have read any number of books. However, when I read DeMille, I am looking for the thrills and chills of a roller coaster like ride. Unfortunately, it took too many pages for Paul Brenner to reach his destination and too many hours for me to reach the end of this book.This won't sour me on future DeMille novels, however I waited too long for a ride that I spent way too much money for."
3,Wheres the ending ?,"This was a very long book with a good balance of suspense and single thread of tension. Nelson Demille keeps a single thread of suspense and balances it out very well throughout the book. My only complaint that he ended the book with more questions than answers and conclusions. Paul Brenner has this knowledge that could get him killed and Mr. Demille doesn't expand what he is going to do with this information. I thought the book was good overall, but was very disappointed in the ending. For those who like a ending with closure, you wont like this ending.."
3,Alternate DVD release / René Clement's final movie,"Unless you want this film as English-dubbed version only, I suppose you might like to check out this French DVD presenting a fairly good print with orig. aspect ratio (French audio only!) released by reknown French ""René Chateau"" label:Film: 8/10Picture quality: 8,5/10 (46"" screen with upscaling)Aspect ratio: 1.66:1 orig.-4:3 TV -> Letterbox-16:9 flat tv -> WindowboxRun time (PAL 50 Hz): 1 47'05""Audio: FST: -RC 2; 1??Chapt.: 1 (= NO chaptering!)ASIN: B001Q8UOPGStudio: René ChateauCast incl. Maria Schneider, Robert Vaughn, Sydne Rome, Nadja Tiller, Vic Morrow, Georg Marischka etc."
1,Pathetic attempt at rewriting history,"Absolutely pathetic diatribe of salivating political correctness over truth. As a history teacher specializing in the US prior to 1877, I thought that this might be a good resource for 8th grade US history students. I was miserably mistaken after having read only 30 pages of this drivel. The two women propagandists show absolutely no regard or knowledge of the mores of the early 1800s. Without going into detail, the below reviewers had already stated what the book is full of in vast detail. Please read their reviews. I highly recommend avoiding this book as anyone with an iota of knowledge about early America or American Indians in the early 1800s will find these distortions and disingenuous nature highly offensive."
1,American Indians Can Do No Wrong,"This book is written with an obvious anti Lewis & Clark bias. These men are consistantly criticised for being arrogrant, guilty of making snap judgements, and for being incompetent. However, the Native Americans can do no wrong. Any questionable activity is either ignored or justified because it is a native cultural practice and apparently then something beyond question.This same consideration is not bestowed upon the men of the expedition."
1,More religious than spiritual I believe...,"It definitely seems to be more religious than I expected. Although I only browsed though it, I thought there were going to be more recurring themes regarding reincarnation, children relating stories of having been here before,or knowing things beyond their circumstances. It does have some sweet stories and is nicely laid out for the reader. I got a bit choked up reading a couple of the stories."
2,you get what you pay for,"this blush doesn't work for me. i'm a rather tan Asian, but on the lighter side and the color of the blush didn't really come out that nicely. you could hardly see it in fact. it would last me about an hour then slowly fade away so there was little to no point in me applying any of this. i know its cheap, but for me, it didn't work. so i wouldn't recommend it."
3,okay,"I thought it would be darker but its a little too light for me and its very glittery. Not a natural look, but its cute for those who like glitter and shimmer. super fast shipping which was awesome!"
5,Perfect for fair skin,"I have extremely fair skin and I'm not a fan of powder blushes. I had actually been using a cream lip stain before trying this blush.Well, I love it. I've had one pot of Peach Satin for almost two years, and I'm just now having to replace it. In fact, I'm only replacing it because it's a bit dry, not because it's lacking product.If you're a medium or darker skin tone, I would get a darker shade or you might be disappointed with the amount of product needed per application. For light light skin, you can use a really soft touch and still get gorgeous color."
5,Great Product,I bought this blush and I really love it. It's weird because it's mousse and not powder but it's really nice. It goes on smoothly and it's a nice pink color. So far it has not irritated my skin at all.
2,Ended up returning,"I ended up returning this product. While it does provide worksheets with exactly what it describes, I found there really wasn't anything groundbreaking. It was all worksheets I could have compiled myself by searching online."
5,Great show... with so many awesome characters,Great show. Do yourself a favor and let yourself get hooked on it. There are so many great characters in this show... The show does a great job tying in the long-term plot with shorter-term plots/cases. I wish I was as cool as Raylon!
5,Just keeps getting better!!!,"This continues to be one of the most entertaining and addicting series that I have watched. The actors deserve far more exposure than they receive and the story lines are so creative and oftentimes, amusing. I hope this just continues to go on. I cannot get enough of watching the antics of Timothy Olyphant who always finds his use of his weapon as ""Justified"". Great series!!!"
5,More great episodes - great extension of Season 1,"This picks up where season 1 left off and the great storyline just keeps rolling on...great characters, great acting, wonderful dark humour throughout - one of my favourite 'stumble upons' in amazon - fantastic series from start to finish"
5,Best Show,This is hands down one of the best shows on television. Definitely recommend you all to watch Justified and Sons of Anarchy.
5,Excellent Series,"Good characters, interesting and often quirky plots result in entertaining TV. It always seems that each episode ends too soon."
3,Not as good as first season,Really felt this show went downhill from the first season. Raylan just doesn't do a whole lot other than get beat up a couple times and talk to a bunch of people. (and get back together with his ex-wife.) Not too impressed.
1,"Justified Season 2, #1",Great show but the quality of the video was so bad I would not watch it again on Amazon. It was as though it was streamed in 8mm.
5,"A very well thought, filmed and acted show. I thought it would be the = of season 1, but it's even better!","I am not a TV watcher. I watch these shows via an iPad at the gym while on an elliptical machine. This is my new favorite show for such a task. Very well done. Based in reality? Much is, though shows pull out boredom, shoot too much, compress time. The acting here is great, a modern western with a twist. The filming and editing is top notch. Story line hard to leave. I got so hooked I had to watch the last 4 shows straight. Hear that from a TV addict is one thing. From me, quite the opposite, a huge plus. I am so very very glad I stumbled on this show (on sale at Frys was how it all started)."
5,A must see,"Incredible acting By Timothy and Walton, just stunning and the writing is brilliant. A bit slow in some episodes but it is TV. Not as good as Deadwood but then what is?"
5,An old classic on combat shooting that is a must read for anyone interested in real life self-defense.,"This great book was first published in 1942 but the techniques and tactics are as relevent today as they were when the book was first published. This book deals with real life combat shooting methods. This volume should be read by anyone who is interested in learning the techniques and tactics of the Fairbairn and Sykes combat shooting method.The emphasis is on close range point shooting. As a former range instructor for my agency, I emphasized a combination of point and site shooting for street combat. In conclusion, this is a classic that will be of interest to anyone into the use of firearms for self-defense.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Monadnock Defensive Tactics System)."
4,Dated but Hilarious - Very 60s,"I would have given this a 5 star rating (it's one of my favorites), but some of the phone company humor is dated and may confuse those who weren't around in the 60s.The Satire lashes out in all directions. Some of the visual humor is hilarious and unique.Excellent acting by the entire cast. This is some of Coburn's best work.The casting was quirky in spots, but perfect anyway. Severn Darden and Godfrey Cambridge seem like odd choices for career spies, but it works.Godfrey Cambridge gives a shockingly powerful performance early in the film in a scene where he reveals childhood racial issues to his psychiatrist. The movie would be worthwhile for that performance alone.There is a rare beautiful unplugged song by Bary McGuire that is ironic background music for lots of spies killing each other. I had thought the title of the song was ""Changes"", but I couldn't find any info, and I've never heard it elsewhere."
5,Bulls video,Why not have a great collection of bulls games and player memories! What a collection! I had fun watching and remembering those great championship moments!
4,Good character development,"Very interesting plot. Unusual characters with a real sense of character development. They grew, learned and changed based upon their experiences and interactions."
2,Not Happy,"I have to say that I am extremely disappointed in this product. After just a few months with normal usage, I noticed small tears beginning to form around the screws attaching the band to the plastic holder.Also, two of the Velcro patches used to secure the armband have peeled away rendering my arm band useless.This product is not very durable and for $25 to $30 dollars is expensive to have to replace every 8 months or so.I do not recommend this product to anyone."
3,SOng at end of movie,There is a song at the end of the movie just as al pacino finishes talking to wili and walks away then willi throws the ball and talks aobu this hurt arm when he turns back al is gone and will stands alone on the field then the song startsi love that song please help!?!?!?
3,whats that song?,"it is a very short song, some where in the middle of the movie, and the words you hear are ""bless me father for I have sinned..."", i thinks it happens when you see a darkened stadium, can any one help me?"
3,Moby,"Well, I don't know if this helps, but I believe there is a song by Moby called ""Memory Gospel"" used in the movie. It was really effective, too. I thought the music was one of the most powerful aspects of this awesome movie!"
2,Yet another track missing.,"I have found another track that is not on either album. Someone mentioned that Moby ""Graciosa"" was missing from the first volume but was included in the second volume. But, there was another Moby song that was in the movie and not on the soundtrack. The song is ""My Weakness"" and it's played when Beamon is about to make the last pass before they make the final touchdown and win the last game shown in the movie. And, I like to say Renee of Ventura, CA if she reads this is that I'm glad I could help you with ""Right Here, Right Now"", and it feels good to help someone out who lives pretty close to me. Just to let you know, I knew this song because I own the Fatboy Slim CD that has it."
2,"More ""Huh?"" Tracks from the Film...","The only redeeming item on this cd is the ""Fingers"" speech. I foolishly bought both cds today (12-31-2001) and am incredibly disappointed. Neither cd has THE songs from the film that make you want the soundtrack in the first place! Where is the Kid Rock one? How about ""Paranoid""? Where is the ""You ready for this"" one? Ah, whatever. Learn from my mistake - DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY. Sorry to ""shout"", but I wasted over 30 bucks on these 2 cds."
2,Yet another missing track.,"I remember reading on a review that there was a Moby track missing on Vol. 1, which was ""Graciosa"", and that was put on the second volume. But, I found another Moby track missing that was in the movie and not the soundtrack and this is ""My Weakness"" which can be heard when the Sharks win the last football game shown in the movie. And, if Renee from Ventura sees this, I just want to say that you're welcome for fatboy slim. I know it because I have the Fatboy Slim CD with that song just to let you know. I'm glad I could help someone who lives awfully close to me. :-)"
3,Gliclazide Profile,I am interested in knowing if Gliclazide profile is covered in this edition. Please inform by email.
4,A large sampling of Stravinsky's piano music.,"I bought this cd primarily for ""Movements for Piano and Orchestra"", a short piece (about 9 minutes) using the 12 tone serial technique developed by Arnold Schoenberg. It is intriguing to hear the ""neo-classicist"" Stravinsky write in this style. To my ears, and I'm a fan of 12 tone, no new ground is broken here by Stravinsky (the piece was written in 1958-9, seven years after Schoenberg's death) but it's a good piece. The rest of the works are tonal.I'm not knowledgable as to whether this cd contains all Stravinsky's piano compositions but there is a lot here. Michel Beroff is a fine pianist and the recorded sound is very good. The liner notes are lacking but I've come to expect that from ""bargain"" classical cds.This is a two cd package. For $12, I'm very glad to have this set in my collection."
2,parts of it LAME,"One thing that really pissed me off with this album is how Michel Beroff does his own thing and does NOT follow the tempo markings. People think ""oh whatever the heck I feel is the tempo"" but it takes away from the character of a piece. For example in ""Les cinq doigts"" he plays the Lento as an Allegro and everything else the same fast tempo. It makes everything this loud and fast music when there's much more personality in this master gem that Stravinsky composed.Most of the CD sounds very mechanical, and if any character in his playing it's very one-sided. Does not do Stravinsky's strong compositional personality justice."
2,Requires massive update,"I'm unable to play this game, due to the updates that need to be downloaded first. 3G is the only ""high speed"" internet available to me, and I let this game do its self updating overnight, and in the morning, it wasn't even at 1%. Not sure how large the updates are, but they must be huge."
5,A great resource for those wishing to expand their minds,"I found this to be an interesting read. It puts forth many ""new"" and unique ideas. While many of the things Konstantinos describes aren't ""new"" at all, they're certainly not very publicized. I have tried several techniques in the book and have found them to be very effective. I expect I'll keep coming back to this great resource in the future."
2,"Works OK, but...","any of the wire spiral design work better. If the eggs are fresh, one has to shake the whites off the yoke."
5,First Flight,"The flight was going fine; I was at about 300ft high, when the easystar went out of range of my controller. I could see the plane start down but could not do anything about it. After crossing a power line, about 1/2 mile away I could see the Easystar lying at the base of a Power Pole. It had hit the Pole nose on and the nose was shoved all the way into the canopy. I've read how tuff this material that is used to make this plane is but it sure didn't bounce off that pole. TOTALED that's what it is.It would take a new body to repair, and then I'm not sure of the electronics'Overall it did fly well."
2,Quite boring and plain art.,I bought it because Arnold Schwarzenneger mentioned meeting Andrew Wyeth in his autobiography. The book was a dud. The art work was uninspired.
4,Where is the rest of the book?,"Not much of a guide with only 140 pages. Book was in perfect condition except for highlighted areas. It was a nice story and I got several chuckles because I have had similar experiences.""I Walked Away"" is just over 1/2 the size and more than Double the cost of ""Retiring in Thailand"" by Philip Bryce. After seeing the book I was shocked at the price being near $40. For what? I would recommend the latter not the former if you really want a guide. Mr. Zeising's book it very realistic and interesting but it is not complete. It is just a nice story and severely outdated with Baht to $ value. Skip it.I cannot believe I paid $39 for this book."
4,Sony NP-FP71,Good battery life...lasts about 3 times longer than OEM battery. Still a little bulky tho.
5,Sony NP-FP71 InfoLithium P Series Battery Pack for Sony Camcorders,Great price and great product for frequent flyer or in a amusement park for the whole day and there is no output to charge your camcorders - it is good have a spare battery for your PSP. It claims that it work 4-5 hours reality it gives you between 3-4 hours life. Works great.
2,Not a quality Wig,"I purchased this wig from another source, but it is the same wig. I combed it out and it just does not look like the picture. The pig tails have balled up, cheap plastic ""hair"" under them and you can't comb it out if you even touch it to much it falls off! I combed the bangs a lot and you can't even see the ""widow's peak"". I am going to try washing it next, hopefully it won't fall apart. If I had paid more I might have been upset. This isn't a quality wig."
5,Hacking the Muvo for the 4gb Microdrive,"The really interesting thing about this MP3 player is that it uses a Hitachi Microdrive for it's storage. This same drive at 4gb sells for over $400.If you are in the market for a large capacity micridrive your best bet is to purchase the Muvo and ""harvest"" the drive. Takes a little work but you save yourself some cash."
1,Wrong item shipped,"I ordered a waterproof windbreaker, they sent a zip front hooded sweat shirt. I needed the item for a trip where I anticipated a lot of rain and I didn't have time to reorder. I returned the wrong item and went with what I had which wasn't the right thing either but, it was better than what they sent.I'm not happy."
2,getting impatient,"the product was received on 6/18. When I tried it on I found it to be too large, Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6/20. I'm still not sure about the return policy! When I hadn't heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them. I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed, Large, was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped. I'm still waiting! When I get the product I can properly review it!"
4,I Was There!,"Can't believe someone recorded this! I was there and it was an incredible night. Imagine seeing Mountain, Johnny Winter And w/ Rick Derringer and Edgar Winter (who had not even released his first solo LP yet!) and Frank Zappa with Captain Beefheart (and the incomparable Aynsley Dunbar on drums) together on the same bill! Zappa was touring for Hot Rats and the Captain came out and joined him for Willie the Pimp. Opening band Bigfoot also kicked ass. Gotta have this to hear my 13 year old handclaps!"
5,Camera Battery Charger Replacement,"Hi, I lost my camera battery charger and what good is a good camera without a charger. I searched online and quickly found one on amazon.com. It was delivered to me within a few days and is an exact duplicate of the one I lost. I am very please with the service and quality. Thanks.... SuzanneOlympus LI-10C Battery Charger for Select Stylus and C series Digital Cameras"
4,Olympus LI-10C/12C Battery Charger,"Works as expected, very reliable and durable and a must have for those all so popular proprietary Lithium ION batteries that we all have in digital cameras."
1,Disappointed in product,"I had purchased this item a few years ago and my son had no issues with it, yet when I bought the second one I was really shocked it has so many issues. If you buy this item buy directly from Amazon, so if there are any issues with the firmware, you can get it replaced.Otherwise it is easy to load music onto it, has a great lit screen.If only Archos would fix the firmware issue it would be the only mp3 I would purchase."
2,Uke,"Cheap & cute. Okay for beginners.When you get it, change the strings for a better sound.The neck came off when it dropped, but any repairs I do will only make it better."
4,eye opener,This book giver a fresh new perspective on the purpose of marriage-much different than what we read and see in love movies and love stores--this is What You Need To Read before You Get Married!
5,good,the quality is very good. It provide a view about marriage from God's angle. It also reveal some illusion about romantic.
5,Thought Provoking,"The officiant of our wedding wanted my fiance and I to read this as part of our counseling. It was fantastic. It really taught us the importance of serving and how to serve each other. It has a unique view that is very biblical, and not at all dominering towards women!"
2,OK,The book cover shown was not the book sent. It was an earlier edition with a different picture on the cover. I just hope the text is the same as newer editions.
5,MUST READ!,"God prompted me to get this book AFTER divorce! My denomination teaches that marriage is dissolved after divorce. God kept showing me in scripture that marriage is for life. After being confused for so long, and never before hearing of this book, God directed me right to it. While reading ""Sacred Marriage"" my eyes were opened, my heart was softened, and I saw God's will for my life-partner and me. I am currently in the process of reconciling my marriage under God's leadership. God is the God of second chances!"
4,Highly Recommended,"The only reason I have given this four stars is because I haven't finished it yet! So far though, it's been very, very good and definitely takes a different course than most marriage books. The author is engaging and stays true to scripture, I think every married couple should read this. If you are seeking counseling for your marriage, I recommend reading Boundaries and then this book....they balance each other pretty well I think."
3,"Lots of truth, but may not be for everyone","Gary Thomas sets up the frame for marriage well. Some of his examples however, are long and are not of Christian couples. That's all fine and dandy because the points illustrated are clear. However, I would like to see more references to how God plays a role in our marriage. Also, some of the topics and questions are geared toward those who have been married awhile or who are older. I'm just not quite there yet."
1,child or adult? Listing doesnt make sense,"Headline says adult, descriptions calls it ""child"", one part of the listing says it's from one company, another part says it from another. Description is lacking. I did not buy this product because I could not figure out just what I was getting. Amazon has more than a dozen Darth Vader Costumes, I would bet they mostly are the same, but with the descriptions allowed to store fronts by Amazon it's impossible to tell. My first Amazon order for the same product,I think? was canceled by the store front I ordered from so Amazon sent me a link that may or may not be the same product...I just can't tell from the vague conflicting descriptions...This may or may not be the product I want...."
5,ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS,"Tigerlily is by far one of the most perfect albums. There are very few albums where you like every song. Tigerlily is an incredible debut for the very talented Ms Merchant's solo career. She proves her lyric and songwriting ability, and then some. You can't just listen to her songs, you have to read the lyrics and listen to how she constructs the songs. She's amazing and I can't wait for a new CD from her."
1,Limited Edition?,"Well, I hate to review something I haven't purchased.Don't get me wrong. I have Tigerlily on cassette. It's great and I want to get the CD for a better listening experience. It comes in two versions, and this version costs much more than the other, but there's very little info on the website as to why. Better sound, or just packaging frills?Ok, I think I'll get the less expensive CD."
5,actually,"this is a brilliant book ... the attention in it is the closest thing we have to straight visionary poetry, in the strictest sense: that is, poetry that takes on as its main project the attempt to penetrate through word and image to the ""other side."" I found reading this book to be a hallucinatory journey; the language in it dominated my way of looking at the world for days afterward.And not to dignify a previous review on this page, but in fact the book won one of the Alice James prizes, which aren't run or chosen by anyone having anything to do with an MFA program that this author went to. Accusations of nepotism simply don't apply in this case ... and frankly, even if the book HAD been published by a friend, why should that matter? It's a fabulous and valuable work, and we should all be grateful that it was published, and be eager to see what the author comes up with next."
3,More of the same,"Our daughter recieved a Leapster for Christmas and has spent hours daily playing with it since. So of course we ran out and bought new games asap! Unfortunately, I don't think Dora was worth the 25 bucks. She likes to play it, and if your son or daughter loves Dora they will enjoy it too...however, I don't feel that there is that much difference between Dora and the original games it came with. There is a version of leapfrog (crossing the lake), and matching pairs (two versions on Dora), and none of the spelling or math options that are on the original game pack. I found the educational value of the game it came with to be much better. And shame on them for missing a good chance to introduce Spanish! Unless your child love Dora or is under the age of 5, this game is a little too elementary."
2,Pleasant Game,"All the reviews I read here warned me of the low-quality of this game as far as learning goes, but encouraged me to get it if my child is obsessed with Dora. Since she is, I did get it, and I have been pleasantly surprised.I was very surprised to discover that the non L-Max Dora game works with the L-Max, not only in handheld mode, but also when connected to the T.V.. A very happy thing indeed.Not only does the dora game reinforce the basic Spanish language skills taught in the T.V. show, it expands on them a bit, adding nicely to the SSL vocabulary. The basic educational tasks are very young and immature for the average student, and my 6yo played all of the games on it, completing all of the tasks within a week of intermittent play. Now she gets bored with it easily, only playing it from time to time to get her Dora fix."
5,Mrs. Brown's 4th Grader,"Stealing SouthBy Katherine AyresThis exciting book is about the Underground Railroad. The main character is a boy named William Spencer who takes many risks to ""steal"" slaves up north to freedom. Working his job as a peddler, Will takes slaves with him to Canada. I recommend this book to you if you like adventure."
3,Half an album,"The first half of this CD is very enjoyable, catchy, melodic and fun. The last half is horrible. The band must have hurried to get the album out to fulfill a contractual obligation. The first half is filled with 60's pop influences, i.e. Beatles, Velvent Underground, but they make it their own. Very well crafted songs. The last half is a monotonous collection of unfinished songs. The meoldies found throughout the first part of the album, that sound so sweet to the ear at first, begin to sound annoying and repetitive by the end. This could have been a great great album if they finished it."
2,"Too big, too expensive","This case is well made and it will surely protect your new F10 digital camera, but it is much larger than it really needs to be. An F10 by itself is small and easy to carry around. Once inside this case, the camera becomes unwieldy and it is no longer much fun to take around with you. I regret buying this case. I suggest you look for a slimmer (and cheaper) one."
5,An editor's greatest secret to share!,"As a professional editor (the owner of Adirondack Editing), I frequently recommend this book to my customers. It solves all of the most common writing mistakes - telling instead of showing, dialogue mechanics, voice, point of view, etc. The reviews I've read from actual authors are definite real-life experiences of how well this book can improve an author's writing skills. I'm glad there is a second edition and I am looking forward to receiving it and seeing what new tips and information are included.NEW AUTHORS - BUY THIS BOOK!!!!PUBLISHED AUTHORS - BUY THIS BOOK!!!!ALL authors, no matter what your writing skills level, can benefit from this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
5,It Hurts So Good...,"I never expected a book on editing would actually improve the sound of my writing, but that's exactly what I got out of this helpful book. These savvy editors show you how to improve not only the way your writing reads from a stylistic point of view, but also the way it sounds, sentence after sentence.They explain everything in easy steps and show plenty of examples and comparisons of ""before and after"" edits that really help you get the idea behind the changes.I really like this book and refer to it constantly to keep my editing sharp and my writing crisp and clean. To me it's indispensible.I'll admit that while I was reading this book, I was also making changes to my manuscript, page after page.Instant humiliation. Instant gratification. It's a damn good read."
5,Highly useful and specific advice for writers,"I've spent 35 years as a publisher, editor, and writer. These 12 chapters provide the most helpful advice for fiction writers that I've ever read.Each chapter addresses one technique or pitfall, such as point-of-view, ""beats"", and repetition. Renni Brown and Dave King give lots of examples, to keep it concrete. Each chapter ends with exercises for the reader. Editors as well as writers will benefit from this advice; so will many non-fiction writers.I work with young people in Laos to improve their writing skills, and often had trouble providing useful, specific advice. This book helped immensely.Don't be misled by the cover on the HarperCollins paperback, which implies the book is about proofreading and copy-editing. That's not at all what the book is about. The poorly-chosen cover just demonstrates what Brown and King say with regard to editing: If you want it done well, you'd better do it yourself, and not rely on your publisher."
2,missed their mark by a mile!,this mod release was totally off the mark with tommy kilmchuck (pro-pain guitars)rob matchetti mutilation/pro-pain on bass and dave chavarri laaz rocket/ill nino/meruder on drums this should have been the best mod cd ever with that talent but it's the most forgetable sad
2,Only good for one song,"I heard their song ""Take a Beetle to the Badlands"" on one of those streaming music sites, and I tried to get the song from Napster. Napster didn't have it, so I called around for a used copy here in town - no dice. I finally gave in and bought it here, and I was really disappointed with the album. The only decent song there was ""Beetle,"" the rest of it was just a waste of money."
2,A SYNOPSIS OF ANALOG 3/99 IN REFERENCE LIBRARY (EASTON).,"TOM DIDN'T LIKE IT. ""CONCENTRATED DATA =MASS?"" NOT RECOMMENDED BY TOM. I TEND TO AGREE. (AGREE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH). -LUCKY"
4,Back Rx a 15 minute a day Yoga and Pilates based program to end low back pain by Vijay Vad,"After watching Dr. Vad on TV, I purchased the above book. It's excellent but I took issue with some of the supine exercises. I'm a fully certified Pilates Instructor. I also have serious neck issues as have most of my older clients. He insists on the head being held up which places an enormous amount of strain on the neck,even if the head is in the correct ""head nod"" position BEFORE lifting the shoulders off the mat. The head should NEVER trail behind the shoulders. (page 72 and page 102) I feel he should have given options, i.e. do not lift head if any strain. The general public, reading this book and seeing those photos, would try and do exactly as seen."
3,"Thoughtfulm, safe process, but does it work????","I felt that Dr. Vad's approach was safe and logical. He has you perform easy basic exercises for some time, and then graduate to more strenuous exercises. I must say, though, as someone is in pretty fair physical condition to begin with, I felt the exercises were too basic, and not at all challenging. There didn't seem to be an abundance of info on treatments or back pain causes either. I guess though, the real proof is, ""Did it work? Did following the program letter for letter improve my back pain?"" And, in my case, which of course is very individual, after following the program to the ""T"" for 8 weeks, it really did nothing me. Decent book, but I'm still looking for the magic bullet."
4,Quick and easy,Got my backsack in good time. It was packaged in a manner that made the new product looked sort of worn. The folding made it have creases in the bag that made the acrylic material in the bag come off. But its a bag and I am happy with it!
3,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed Christina Dodd's Governess Brides series, so I enthusiastically picked this title up when I saw it on a used book rack. Alas, I was very disappointed. Enid and MacLean have so much potential, but it was sadly underdeveloped. The ""twist"" with Stephen and Kiernan was telegraphed from the beginning, but never satisfactorily explained. (WHY did Throckmorton send for her?) MacLean's recovery of his memory came in a flash and very unbelievably, in my opinion, and his treatment of Enid afterwards was highly inconsistent. Finally, the ending was also completely obvious and the ""resolution"" with Enid's dowry came across as tacked-on and poorly done. Altogether, I wasn't happy with the plot or execution, although the characters were mostly enjoyable to read."
5,TOP-NOTCH REFERENCE MATERIAL!,"For any practitioner in the health-care field, particularly in the area of mental health, this is a top-notch reference book. The book is well-organized and presented in a comprehensive manner. From diagnosis and treatment to crisis intervention and practice management, the reference book will provide a welcome addition to the professional library in your office or clinic. The book does not serve as a classic text book, we probably have enough of those around, but for the price, it does make a great addition to a reference library."
2,"Easy read, good general information, and good starting point for beginners.","Book had general statistics on data about functionality of generalized pathology. As a preference I would have like more detailed examples of ways to address identified issues rather than generalized information. However, it can serve useful for beginners needing a starting reference on ways to conduct counseling."
5,Amazingly insightful movie,"Outstanding acting from Jeremy Renner and Minnie Driver. Very thoughtful script... it is very unusual to see Hollywood focus on the ""healing powers of forgiveness"", rather than the need to get ""revenge""."
4,"A bit more abstract, but still a great read.","If you read his first book, you will notice that this book is a bit more abstract, but Clevenger is able to pull the novel together. At some times you dont know if the narrator is going crazy, but Clevenger is very good at drawing you into a characters world, even if its a world you dont want anything to do with. This novel is different from his debut, but still a very entertaining read, with all the style of his first."
1,At least its short.,Luckily you dont have to invest to much time to finish this book. There is really only about 20 pages of actual story the rest are descriptions of visual effects. Its as if Clevenger is pleading with Terry Gilliam to turn this into a movie. This story is in the wrong medium. On the plus side I would love to watch this if it was a movie it would be a trip.
2,Dazed and confused,"Midlife and the Great Unknown came highly recommended to me. I immediately purchased it and played in my car. I still haven't finished it. Very rarely do I not make it through a book, or a book on CD. I don't want to leave any gold nuggets behind, and love hearing someone out. However, with this one I just couldn't do it.While I did pick up some great insights, I found the CD very hard to follow. It was difficult for me to follow the thoughts and often found myself confused and lost.If you find it challenging at times to follow an audiobook, this is not one for you."
5,Cool and Stylish,"I was looking for a men's watch that was both cool and stylish. This one fits the bill. Cool and elegant Danish style combined with tough practicality. The person it was purchased for wanted something that was not 'bling' and chunky, that was suitable for work and play, so he couldn't ask for more. It is as light as a feather and doesn't need to shout about being a great watch, it just is. Can't seem to be able to buy it in Britain though!"
2,Worst of the Lou Pearlman-founded groups,"This group Take 5, didn't really impress me with this album. They tend to copy NSYNC too much on a few of the songs and Backstreet Boys on a few others. They don't sound all that good vocally. A couple of the songs are mediocre and dopey sounding. Lou Pearlman discovered some good Orlando-based groups, but this group didn't move me. Neither did O-Town. Sorry that they broke up--hope they end up on some Where Are They Now show 20 years now to discuss this failed, poorly received album!!!!! Disappointing to me!"
1,Not compatible for en-el3,Do not buy if you need for the en-el3 battery. The charger does not work with the nikon battery en-el3 as stated in the product description.
3,Dissapointing,Ports information is limited. Activities covered are mostly the same as offered in ship excursions.
4,Somewhere Else,Purchased this CD on the recommendation of someone else. I have listened to it a few times and find it enjoyable.
5,Great book,"This book started changing my view in the first 10 pages. Helped relieve some of the stress of having a teenage boy, just by helping me understand what he is going through. Highly recommend this book!"
5,Another must read....,"Imagine growing up in a Christian church and never experiencing joy...Why? I don't listen to much CCM these days for pretty much the same reason so many grow up in churches without joy: It seems that too many are afraid of life! Somehow, if they experience the joys of God's wonderful creation, it must be wrong...Being so quick to dismiss anything prior to the industrial revolution as antiquated, we have fallen prey to a false piety...almost a soul-less exsistance where sin is found in matter (it most certainly does not!), and life is only something to survive in.This book brings Calvinism home. God created all things, and part of our worship of Him is to express our thanks by enjoying His creation. As Christians, we should fear NOT to celebrate His goodness...why do we preach joy, but not live it?This book brings it home.Again.PHyatt"
5,Very nicely build software,"I bought the French and the Italian versions and loved them. What I like the most is the ability of the program to keep you concentrated all the time through audio, visio and interaction making learning of a new language (one of the most repetitive and boring tasks) an interesting one. I don't think you can recognize all the features of the program in one or two hours. I used the software for 2 days and discovered feature after feature making my work even more easier and interesting. The speech recognition is not perfect but I never found the exercises that involve this feature unpassable. You can keep on aiming for the best results or you can continue if you are happy with the way you sound. I am very pleased with this method and will give the software all the stars possible. (I am on line looking to buy the German one too.)"
2,Stiff and uncomfortable,"Lose and sloppy in most ways but tight near toes even though they are the same size as all my shoes. It is possible that the shoes would have been wearable after getting broken in, but I was not willing to chance it for the money. They do have a good arch and are light weight, which I like. Out of the box I did not like the appearance, but once I put them on they looked nice, just wore them on the carpet in the house. I returned them to Amazon with the online print out. Very easy. Maybe shoes are not the best thing to purchase online. I am surprised at all the positive reviews."
3,The are just ok,"bought these for work because I stand all night( I bartend) on concrete. I have Plantar Fasciitis and these are barely ok. There are much better shoes out there. I wish I could return them. oh well - there are better shoes at being ""The Body Shoe"" I'm surte. all)"
5,Feels Good and Looks Pro.,This wire is very flexible and has a very pro. look to it. I have about 23.8 amps running though the wire and the lights have no problem shinging bright with this wire. The wire is thick and feels very good to the touch.
3,Dreaming of cruising,Interesting review of a crusing lifestyle based on affordability. Enjoyed the stories while learning about all aspects of what it takes ( and what it doesn't take) in order to enjoy a cruising lifestyle on a budget.
1,I thought I try it,"This saw had more negative than positive review, but I went ahead and bought one.The chain keeps flying out, no matter how you tighten it.From now on I will take the negative reviews very seriouslyJohn Rash MD"
2,Very very SHORT seat!,"This seat is very, very short compared to a normal seat. It's almost an inch shorter at 6.2"" (instead of the normal 7"") and has a very small cutout hole rather than the longer hole shown in the picture. This wasn't comfortable for me at 155 lbs, 5'6"". I felt like I was struggling to find a comfy spot on the seat and soon realized it's because the seat is just simply way too short. It even looks like a child's seat. I would recommend this only if you are very, very small or are looking for a shorter seat. I can't comment on the comfort of the ride as I couldn't find a happy place on the seat."
4,Great bargain,"For it's price, this heater works well. While it's clearly not designed to heat your entire garage while you're doing a weekend project during the winter, it is perfectly suited to keep your bathroom or bedroom nice and toasty without turning up the main furnace.Our bedroom is about average in size and we keep the heat knob set to about 3.5 out of 6. Any higher and we could bake cookies! (OK, not literally but my point is that the unit has more than enough power to spare)Overall I haven't found a better space heater for the price and I couldn't be happier with this one.The pros:-The unit is well-constructed and sturdy-The fan moves plenty of air, and is whisper-quiet-The metal bars you see in the picture do NOT get hot, which allows them to double as handlesThe cons:-The unit is relatively large (but not heavy) - 9 x 11 x 15 inches; 9 pounds-The power cord is too short, or at least shorter than most heaters I've owned"
5,"THE PRINTS? OF INDIA by General Lewis ""BEN-HUR"" Wallace","A well-respected more mature work than his famous dramatized novel about Judah ben Hur and Christ, which was written following its success after Lew was Minister to Turkey. However, it also deserves your attention and the motion-picture screenplay adaptation is available (ISBN 1-895507-82-0 ...)."
1,Not worth the money,"When I received my item the hose was too small for the bag. Instead of screwing the syringe on the the hose you had to squeeze to get the mouth of the hose to open up enough to put on the bag and to the syringe. The clamp they sent to use was made for a much bigger hose, so it was not small enough to clamp off the water flow. I thought if I just kept the syringe below the bag it wouldn't matter if I used the clamp. Well that didn't work either. The pressure of the water was too much for the too small hose and it flew off the bag on both ends and water sprayed everywhere. I either need a new hose that fits this bag along with the clamp or I just wasted time and money with this catastrophe."
3,From the Sublime to the Ridiculous,"Hans Silvester is by far the best photographer of cats you are ever likely to see. Extraordinary. However, the design of the calendars is horrendous - the print unreadable from any distance more than 10 inches. The previous and next month calendar on each page is readable only with a magnifying glass."
3,FOR NEW DISNEY FANS...,"For NEW fans of the Disney parks, or anyone planning a trip- this is a great DVD set.Would make a great gift to get the kids pumped up for their FIRST Disney visit, or for any age Disney first timers for that matter.For those of us, however who are regulars at the parks, you will find the sales-like theme of this pretty uninteresting (And the music is horrible- Would have MUCH preferred live sounds from the park or any of the music that they actually play in the park). Fun facts were, for me, all things I have known for years...And it does come across as one big, giant commercial for Disney.When I'm needing a Disneyland fix, I'll put on the Disneyland, Anaheim DVD while cleaning the house, or working on the computer- BUT I have realized that I NEVER watch any of the other DVD's in this set.Hope my review helped you make up your mind about purchasing this!"
5,"Disney Parks: The Secrets, Stories and Magic Behind the Scenes","We love Disney World. We have been there more than 20 times in the past years.My grandsons absolutely love to go there and all the Mickey Mouse Club House programs. This video was a ""must"" for their Christmas gifts."
5,Excellent television,"The Joe Schmo show's premiere season could almost be considered as being as auspicious as Survivor's first season. Marked by epic moments like Hutch throwing his ceremonial plate into the fireplace, Matt struggling to like chocolate off of a supermodel's rack, and the dramatic final eviction ceremony. This is truly another great reality show worthy of having its own DVD. If you missed it, buy it. If you enjoyed and and want to relive its glory, buy it. If you didn't like it or you're one of those people who think reality shows don't deserve to be on DVD, screw it, you're probably too much of a numskull to read this review anyway.Bottom line: great show with loads of fun. If you're on the fence about buying this DVD, buy it, and for the love of god watch the second season which is turning out, somehow, to be even better than the first."
5,Molly is hot and fine,All I have to say is this show was so funny and hilarious.The person who played Molly the virgin is so hot and fine.She has a wonderful personality and a wonderful body.She alone is a good reason just to watch this show and that's one of the reason's I would watch it after watching WWE wrestling on tv when this aired on Spike TV. I cant wait to see this DVD and see all the extras and watch Molly she is perfect dang she is so hot. I wish I had someone like that. (...)
3,"love joe schmo, but a little disappointed","well, i love joe schmo, one of the few shows i waited for as the week passed. the hutch is indeed the greatest character ever, followed very closely by bryce the stalker from season 2, but thats beside the point i'm going to make here. this is highlighted for the fact that its uncensored, but it is, indeed, censored. not all of it, the models arent cencored no, there is full unbleeped language (except for the bonus material, which still bleeps, even as they say it doesnt right on the case). one thing i was craving, was molly's bikini top slippage, to see her great, beautiful breast. but nope, blurred. Hutch's prank on kip's photo-album, still blurred. see, i am disappointed not because i don't get to see hutch's or brians ass, but because i wanted complete reality, and they promised no censoring. that is my complaint. still, its joe schmo. i hope next season they don't lie to us again."
5,Excellent,"This book is great for any new mom. I have purchased it for both of my girlfriends the minute the found out they were pregnant. It is a great starter book, and it lets you check your babies development day by day. FANTASTIC!"
1,Updated Review,"I had already written a review of this product, and said it was OK, but after using it, changed my mind. The suction cups are flimsy and don't stick to the window. I replaced it twice and both times it fell off again. I'm disappointed and sending it back for a refund."
2,Not worth buying,"Per some of the other reviews, this indeed has WAY too much filler. Do we really need 3 different versions of ""A Country Boy Can Survive?"" Not in my opinion. And many of the live tracks simply aren't very good. Some of his covers of songs that are owned by other artists are simply shadows of the original versions, such as ""Only Daddy That'll Walk The Line"" and ""Midnight Rider."" The fact that there could be a 3 disk CD set suppposedly covering Hank Jr's legacy between 1979 and 1999 which doesn't include every single he released during that period is just wrong. At $35, this is definitely not a good value. Better to buy used copies of his greatest hits CDs."
1,And All Thru the House,Should be advertised as a book for children. Not expected of McBain. Only 40 pages most of which are drawings! What a disappointment as have read and enjoyed nearly everything McBain/Hunter has written. If had bought new would request refund.
5,Excellent -,"Most 'action' and 'thriller' movies have highly implausible plots. Not 'Day of the Jackal.' This story involves underground French forces (mostly former military) hiring an outside assassin to kill President De Gaulle because they're upset that he's freed Algeria. An Englishman is hired, and thanks to a conniving female sympathizer that seduces one of the top French police leaders, the terrorist group know how the efforts to protect De Gaulle are proceeding. It's a stone wall for them at first. Then dogged determination and focus allows them to follow their quarry, even as he changes identities and 'covers up' his trail by murdering those he encounters."
5,Riveting film making,"I've seen the movie quite a few times but I am still fascinated by it. The director and actors are superb. The tension never stops despite the fact that the outcome, historically, is never in doubt. A fine thriller sure to please."
2,Seens missing,Sound quality poor at least 1 seen missing.these quality items ruin enjoyment of the movie. It isn't worth it to return it
5,Just Wonderful.,"""The Day of the Jackel"" not to be confused with the inferior remake ""The Jackel"", is a marvelous character study of the coldest, coolest, most illusive and highly skilled assassin ever brought to the silver screen. With a superior cast headed by Edward Fox, and an outstanding script, this movie plunges the viewer in a riveting cat-and-mouse manhunt.No, this movie doesn't have explosions and car chases, but what it does have is intelligence and suspense. The tension builds wonderfully as the Jackel, a man of brilliant disguises, nears his prey (Charles de Gaulle) with the intrepid constable a step behind.Rent it or buy it, but for heaven sakes, see it! Between 1 and 10, ""The Day of the Jackel"" gets a 10.As far as the remake, ""The Jackel"", in and of itself, it isn't really a bad film, it has just been modernized and adulterated with gadgets in lieu of a believable script."
5,good,The item was as described and arrived quickly. What more could you want? that's all i know now and forevermore!
2,Not for me,"I know others have used this product and have wonderful benefits, but unfortunately for there was something in it that I allergic too, had to return."
1,can't stomach it,"Thank goodness for the person who suggested vanilla soy milk. Only way I can drink it but can't stop burping it. Only able to take it for 3 days. Vitamin burps and artificial sweetner in the drink are aweful. Tried eating before I took it, ate after I drank it. Didn't matter."
1,Causes Stomach Upset,"I wish there had been a sample so I wouldn't have been stuck with an entire container of this awful product. The taste is horrible, even when mixed with juice. It doesn't dissolve well, so it's very gritty. Worst of all, it caused severe stomach cramps and digestive upset. I gave up on it after two weeks, having seen none of the benefits but a LOT of negatives."
5,Great scoop!,I love it so much I bought a second with a different scoop size. Works especially well for hard ice cream if warmed with water first.
5,great classic,My son loves to watch this movie over and over. We wstched it last night weeks after christmad. Great collection of kids movies.
3,Brings back fond memories,"Disc includes 4 shorts, so I'll rate each individually:5 Stars * Mickey's Christmas Carol4 Stars * Pluto's Christmas Tree1 Star * The Small One2 Stars * Santa's WorkshopThe main title, Mickey's Christmas Carol is why we purchased the DVD, but I would have preferred some other Disney holiday shorts, like The Art of Skiing."
5,dvd,My kids are 1.5 and 3 and both enjoy the older Mickey movies. Not sure why but they do. This is nothing like Mickey Mouse Clubhouse which they also love.
4,Superbly written and factual account of the tragedy,"Joan Piper wrote a very well balanced and factual account of the black hawk tragedy. What kept me interested was the personalization of her story and her ability to remain unbiased...as hard as that must have been. As a blue-suiter myself, I salute the whole Piper family and encourage everyone to read this book!"
4,3-Feet Shielded External eSATA Cable,It is unfortunate that one of these were not furnished with the esata hard drive that I purchased from Fantom GreenDrive Pro 2 TB USB 2.0/eSATA Desktop External Hard Drive. The item works as intended and was delivered quickly.
4,Works fine,The wire works exactly as expected. As previous reviews stated the wire is rigid but it did not impair my ability to get it attached correctly.
5,Works with DVR Expander when included cable did not,"I bought this extra eSATA cable to go with a Western Digital DVR Expander even though the DVR Expander comes with a USB cable and an eSATA cable included. I had read in other customer comments on other external hard drive products that the included cables are usually ""garbage"". For the extra couple of bucks I ordered this cable along with the DVR Expander. I'm sure glad I did. The eSATA cable included would not plug into the DVR Expander or the back of the DVR, obviously from ill-fitting plugs. But this ""3 feet Shielded External eSATA Cable M/M"" fit perfectly and works beautifully. Good product and good reason to encourage honest customer comments. Thanks, Amazon!"
3,eSata Adaptor for Cable Extension,"Adaptor arrived a couple of days late. It came regular mail. Since this is close to Christmas, I don't think faulting the supplier is fair, however. Fortunately this was a change that I could wait for. If I could not I would have paid for enhanced handling anyway.I am changing from USB 2.0 to eSata to get the improved performance over the external link. Could be up to 6GB from the USB 2.0 .5GB, hopefully.Simple product. Typical I/F cable is only 12 inches long and is M to F. Extension cables are typically M to M so an F to F adaptor is needed. Hence the adaptor I purchased.I have not hooked the system up yet. I have seen a couple of caveats on the use of the adaptor and cable with my Seagate GoFlex external and my Notebook. I will be trying it in a few days.Perhaps I can update the review then."
4,Covers a lot of issues but manages to handle them all well,"This is in many ways quite a gritty story -- promiscuity, unprotected sex, marital infidelity, self-mutilation, drug addiction, steroid use, abortion and suicide are all touched upon in some way. Yet somehow the author manages to get them all in without it seeming like an after-school special. Samantha and her family and friends could be at any middle-class suburban high school. Although there wasn't much of a plot here and Noah's death didn't play as big a role in the story as I expected it would, I thought this was a very realistic portrait of how things are, especially the arc of Samantha's relationship with Farouk. In other words: win."
3,Pink Storage Cubes fill a need,"I am using these to store my Mary Kay inventory. When my husband and I ordered them, we were under the impression that they were solid plastic. They are not. It's some kind of flexible material, so I have a little bit of a problem getting my inventory to not fall over as the center bows a little bit with the weight. They were a little confusing to put together, but once we figured it out, it went fine. I had purchased several sets, and combined them. Over all, I am satisfied with this product. They look good, and can be configured in many different ways."
3,not so spectacular,"If you've got to have a 2002 Beatles wall calendar, this is the one. I suppose it's the only one on the market. But the photos in this calendar leave much to be desired. All of the photos are posed, flat-looking images. Many of them are not in complete color.Several of them are printed with black and one color. For example, black, along with several shades of green. And several of the photos have lines laid along them, to give the appearance of interconnecting photos, in their frames.This calendar is just not so great. There are better photos of The Beatles available-- maybe the company is holding those back to use next year.ken32"
1,"great fan for an hour, then kaput","I loved this fan. This was the best desk fan I ever had.. Then, after about 1 hour of use, a bearing or something went loose inside the motor and it is making a horrible, sick helicopter type noise now. Aarrg!"
3,"Good fan, but you can't direct the air","It's a good little portable, quiet fan. However, since the middle of the fan is so big compared to the cloth fan blades, you can really only circulate air around you. If you want a direct breeze on your face it's not going to happen since it blows a wide range of air and not a direct stream. This could be good or bad depending on what you're looking for."
1,Nice looking piece of junk,This fan started making noise within a few days of use. Shortly the high speed failed. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
1,3 out of 4 broken,"I purchased four units to gently circulate air quietly near my XBox360, PS3 and a subwoofer amp. It was perfect because they are gentle, kinda weak, but very quiet! Perfect, cept they 3 of the 4 broke. Warranty shipping costs exceeded the actual price and thus make the fans a waste of money. Save your dough and get something that works!"
1,Worst Fan Ever,"All this stupid thing does is disturb the air -- it generates ZERO breeze, and ZERO relief. My old fan -- which had soft plastic blades you could also stick your fingers in without getting hurt -- was a miracle compared to this turkey. How did this get past even Round 1 of Vornado product review???? It's really unbelievable."
3,Stopped working after 3 weeks,"I bought 2 of these Zippi fans from 2 different vendors. I had one working for about 6 months and was so pleased with it that I bought another one. The second fan worked for about 3 weeks and then started rotating slower and slower over a couple of days and then eventually stopped. My first one is still working just fine and I love it. However, due to the experience with the second one, I have to give it only 3 stars."
5,Great desk fan,This is a great desk fan. It may not cool a room but it is a very high quality fan that moves air around an office cube just fine and is almost silent on the low setting.
4,Not bad,"I use this at my desk every day and it works pretty well. Its very quite, and puts out some good wind. It could be a bit stronger."
2,"Good performance, when it was working.","I ordered this to have a fan I could fit on my desk at work, and for that purpose it worked great. After two weeks of no problems using it, it just wouldn't turn on. Some other reviews mention the same problem occurring at different time spans, but it seems to be an issue with this particular fan. The cost of sending it back to the shipper isn't worth the refund, so don't rely on being able to return it later if it does break suddenly."
2,Nothing more than an okay supplement to Hypnotica,"I was pretty disappointed in this b/c I thought they would've refined Hypnotica. But I guess it's hard to follow that act. Maybe they should collaborate with The Biz more often.Don't get me wrong, I love the ""chainsaw"" and pounding bass. And this is still a pretty good album. But I'd suggest Hypnotica over this."
5,Learn to Knit Socks Review,"This is more of a pamphlet than a book, but the instructions are excellent and better than an actual book I had previously purchased. This is easy to carry with your sock project. Received quickly. I love knitting socks!"
3,Good...could have been better,"I was unable to find the suggested yarn, and so spent quite some time finding a substitute. I felt more detailed directions and pictures would have been helpful. The directions are pretty simple, and the basic sock pattern good for beginners. I needed to get help from another knitter to be able to finish a sock, even with the book."
1,Waste of time and money - skip it...,"I am long time customer of Adorama but this was a waste of time and money. I needed a part quickly and so I did a mail order, thinking, how hard could it be to find a decent quality plastic screw mount petal lens hood at a reasonable price? Oh well. This thing won't mount on my sunpak filter, it starts to screw on but the plastic threads are poorly formed and it falls off. When I attempt to mount it directly on the lens barrel it goes on. But the plastic collar that is meant to lock it in place just spins around. Result: the hood spins around. It's an eleven dollar piece of plastic junk. I probably should have known better. Don't make the same mistake! I suspect that $20 might get me a reasonable hood but there are no shortcuts: you really need to take the lens to the store and ask to try the hood. This thing is going to end up a dog toy. At least my Dachshund got something out of the deal!"
1,Not Great,"I wish there would have been a review on this before I purchased it. The acting is poor (unless you want a laugh) and the setting is obviously not taking at all in Africa. There is one interview with some historian with a pony tail, red suit, and wild tie. If it weren't for the non-intended comedy, I would have fallen asleep.It is also amazing how there is so little focus on David Livingstone's religion or influence.Do not purchase this documentary!"
2,boring,"what flick did these folks watch? I read so many good things about this,but what i saw was an overlong snooze fest.i feel ripped off by the 25 bucks I tossed away,so be damn sure you really want it. the extras are way better than the main feature,i gotta stop now,im getting sleepy just thinking about this thing again."
4,senior engineer,"I want to get the information about microwave engineerings through this book. after reading it, actual I will design the microwave module in my company. Thank you in helping me"
5,"My best cookbook, by far!!","I have a bookshelf full of cookbooks. The ones I don't use, I give away, so the shelf is only full of the books that I use regularly. However, this is far and away the one that I use the most! I love this cookbook. I have never been disappointed with any of the recipes in this book. I received this cookbook 18 years ago from an Italian-American friend who is a phenomenal cook. I LOVE it. I have given it to many friends. My husband and I bought 5 copies used on the internet since this lovely book is out of print. We kept two copies for our children (5 and 7) and have given the others away as wedding gifts. What else can I say. I LOVE THIS BOOK, and find the recipes easy, tasty, and a great hit at parties."
1,Not the complete novel!!,"This book contains less than 20% of the novel. It begins with Part II, chapter 49 and ends with Part II, chapter 74. What's missing is: Part I, chapters 1 - 49 (the entire Part I), and Part II, chapters 1 - 48 (about 2/3 of Part II). Nowhere in the book's description is this little fact mentioned. Outrageous!"
5,Great product saved my life,"Great product saved my life, do you know that you don't have to get older.this book and it's pink sister are a must read for those of you who don't exercise and don't believe your body requires heavy lifting to survive!"
4,Motivation,"The book motivated me to get serious about a committed work out program and healthy eating. I lost 20 pounds in 7 weeks and will continue for 15Younger Next Year: Live Strong, Fit, and Sexy - Until You're 80 and Beyondmore pounds. I am now committed long term - I feel so much better with lots of energy. I am anxious to surprise my doctor on my next yearly exam."
2,What the heck was that?,"If you cant read and comprehend whats in this book in less than 1 hour, you are freaking dead. If you buy this book forget about reading the cute stories about the authors lives and just go to the appendix and read Harry's rules. Thats all there is of substance to this book. Exercise every day and eat right. Thats it. Done. If this book changes your life, you either never had one or you never paid attention to anything.I gave the book 2 stars because there are 2 authors."
5,Review of Younger Next Year,"Great book. Gets down to earth on losing weight and the must do's to be ""Younger Next Year"". I have fought for years to keep weight off. Chris tells you straight up what has to happen. I would reccomend this book, if you are serious about losing weight and staying in shape."
2,Maintaining Mental Health is not only aerobic,A good succinct review. But like the book It does not point out the value of hobbies that may be a little less cardiac and a lot more cerebral. These too are important in maintaining the health of the mind and the psyche.. Gardening for instance is the most popular hobby. A book like the Zen of Watering Your Garden which encourages this hobby.Zen of Watering Your Garden
3,Would have made a good pamphlet,"This was a quick, easy read, but it could have been quicker. The authors had three main points: (1) Quit eating crap; (2) Get at least an hour a day of vigorous (sweat) aerobic exercise at least six days a week for the rest of your life, including at least a couple of days of resistance (anaerobic) training; and (3) connect or engage socially and/or spiritually to stay plugged in.Apart from some useful explanations of how the body reacts to various nutrition/exercise regimens, fulsome gratuitous boilerplate about the putative macroevolutionary reasons for the aforesaid, and far too many pages of repetitious self-indulgent blather by the non-physician co-author, that's about it. Blow away the chaff and there's maybe three chapters of useful content."
3,Younger,"If you can get past the fact that every other word is about evolution, you'll be ok. It was too blatant for me!!"
5,Better Next Year fabulous,"If you are looking for a set of tables to tell you which aerobic and strength exercises to use in the final third of your life this book will only tell you to look elsewhere.On the other hand if you want encouragement, ideas on how to approach exercise and nutrition and finding things to focus on in your retirement years and an understanding of both the processes and medical details of what exercise is all about THIS IS YOUR BOOK.I have been exercising for many years (now 65) but did not know some of the fine points of why and what approaches to take. Having read this book I am much more aware and enthusiastic to refine my approach and make my exercise and nutrition routines so much better. I knew that I would have do something in my retirement years but I was quite ignorant as to why it is needed. Now I am more aware.Well done book. To identify the actual activities and strenth exercises, however, you will have to go to a trainer or more books."
3,"Skip the Egotistical Braggart Parts, Read what the Doctor Says","A couple chapters into this, I couldn't take the egocentric ramblings of Chris Crowley, and proceeded to skip his gag-inducing stories about his sexual prowess and phenomenal athletic abilities. Dr. Lodge, on the other hand, has written an entirely different book (within the same book) that is interesting, informative, and flows nicely from one subject to the next. I knew a lot of what he has to tell, but it's OK to reinforce that knowledge once in awhile. His advice is simple, straight-forward, and encouraging. I definitely don't think reading this was a waste of time (except for Crowley's pieces). I'd give Crowley one star, based on what little I could stomach. I'd give Dr. Lodge 4 stars. Too bad he couldn't have just written his own book."
4,"Great Information in a Casual, Readable Style","This book is a hoot! Not only does it provide great information about living a healthier life, but the author's sense of humor is evident. I found myself chuckling at his tongue-in-cheek comments. But on a more serious note, I've always asserted that education is a powerful tool to motivate change. As a nurse, I appreciate knowing the physiology behind the advice. And he takes complicated physiology and makes it user-friendly. You need a copy of it on your shelf -- AFTER you've learned what it has to teach."
4,Doctor's orders,My Dr. prescribed this book to me and it's a fun read with very good info. Hope to be younger next year!
5,Great Book,This is a great book on tape and the service to get it was also very good.My Husband has enjoyed the book and is now sharing it with his friends.
3,book,Book is good.Easy to read. Great information on how to stay healthy in the later years. Well written and interesting but middle pages all came out right away which made it difficult to read.Kind of a pain. Had to tape pages in.
4,Not for guys only,"Exercise hard six days a week every week...until you are dead! No excuses. No guarantees, however, but I would rather die on the cross trainer than live a few years longer as an abused, slobbering lout in a nursing home. Written for guys, but great for the ladies also. Exercise, diet, a connection with something, and commitment are first priorities, although I wish the authors had written more in depth on the importance of sleep. Recommended for public and academic libraries and for the personal libraries of anyone who looks to the future. Should be required reading for coaches! Serious readers may also be interested in RealAge by Michael F. Roizen."
2,Not DDC compatible,"While this unit does indeed split the VGA signal, if you're using anything that relies on Display Data Channel (DDC) info being passed back to the computer, this will NOT do it. You computer will not recognize what type of device is plugged in to this splitter.May be solid for general applications, but if you are using specialized projection software that relies on DDC to recognize the second monitor, look elsewhere."
3,not ver y easy to set up,"we took this to the beach and it was a real pain to set up and take down, i would have preferred more of a pop-up"
4,cooky spooky oooky - funny,"The cousin It comes to visit episode is a little on the slow side. But, The Addams Family goes to Court is HILARIOUS. That episode makes it worth the purchase. Gomez in court is very funny. Likened to Addams Family Values when Gomez goes to the Police Station to report that his brother owns... A BUICK! As a huge Addams Family fan, I highly recommend this video as a great addition to any VHS collection."
1,This item did not work on my T42-2374,"I got this product replaced and it did not work the second time around either. They were very quick o reply and replace the part the first time around. The second time around I have no response at all. I have sent 3 reminders already over the last 2 weeks asking for help.I get a blue BIOS screen with an error sayingSTOP: 0x0000008E (0xC0000005, 0x8054B0B4, OxBA198844, 0x00000000)At other times I get an error message saying memory cannot be ""written"" and later memory cannot be readI have spent a lot of money on shipping, I live overseas and I have spent enough on shipping costs already. I really need to get this thing to work but I am getting no help. The seller does not pick up the phonesAre you sure that this is the correct part?"
3,A fair book on the knife that has some historical value.,"This book is dated and about two thirds of the book provides a historical perspective on knife fighting as well as showing various types of edged weapons. The final section covers the basic knife grips, stance, thrusting, slashing techniques and mental discipline.In conclusion, the real value of this text is its historical aspects.Rating: 3 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Tanto-Jutsu & Wakizashi-Jutsu Manuals)."
4,Decent system,"Based on ignorant people stating the 797Mhz processor speed as a fault there is proof that there are still a lot of people that have no business owning a computer. The HP ZV5320US is a decent computer. It's not a high end laptop, but it's nice. I did a benchmark test side by side against my Dell Inspiron 2650. The Dell having a 1.8Ghz P4. The HP out-performed the Dell on every level. One might ask..if you had a P4 Dell why did you get a new laptop? Easy Dell Sucks BAD!! They are the Bose of the computer world. Tons of Marketing (it's a dell DUDE) and very bad product. Anyhow back to HP. I love the styling of the computer. The screen is probably the best feature. The worst feature is the video card is weak, and the mouse is sluggish every now and then. This is my first AMD machine, and I am sold. No more Intel for me. Over inflated prices for the performance. I bought the computer for $850 from a retailer new, so shop around. Another thing is the AMD runs way cooler than the P4m."
5,THE BEST LAPTOP I EVER OWNED,"I HAVE HAD MANY LAPTOPS OVER THE YEARS, THIS ONE IS PERFECT, I PICKED THIS ONE OUT BECAUSE OF THE SPEED,WIDESCREEN, AND GRAPHICS... I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE POWER CORD!OR ANY THING ELSE. THE GRAPHICS IS GREAT FOR GAMING OR GRAPHIC WORK. ITS A LITTLE HEAVY BUT I PREFER IT THAT WAY, SEEMS THE LIGHTER THE LAPTOP THE MORE THEY TEND TO BREAK, ATLEAST I KNOW THIS CAN STAND TO BE BUMBED INTO."
3,Amazing but brief,"Simply put, Coaster Works is a fun and amazing game that is over far too quickly. I was able to complete this game in about 5 hours - that's just too fast. Now that it's complete, I'm not sure what more I can do with it. I could perhaps continue building coasters just to see how Thrilling a coaster I could create, but the game provides no way to name or compare coasters. It would also be nice if I could somehow extend the 240 segment limit or increase the maximum coaster height - some truly unique and incredible coasters could be built. Another nicety would be more interesting or editable terrain rather than just a large, flat rectangles.Ultimately, I think this game is really neat, but has fallen far short of its potential. Perhaps a Coaster Works 2 could be created to address some of this game's shortcomings."
1,Worst Arabic Grammar Book on the Market,"This book is clumsily written and with no specific order to it. It has proven completely ineffective as a teaching tool in dozens of universities, including the prestigious Defense Language Institute at Monterey, California (DLI threw it out).In addition to being clumsily put together, the book's grammar lessons are not entirely accurate-there are numerous errors throughout its instruction.This book should be avoided."
2,Al-Kitaab Volume 1,"This book is a poor attempt at teaching a language and does so through stories of a girl, Maha. The fact that I did not know the word for ""hand"" until one of the final chapters but I learned United Nations, translator, and literature in the first chapter before key words like ""want"", ""like"", or ""go"" really annoyed me to no end. If you can avoid buying this book do so."
1,This Book is MISTITLED: it is NOT for beginners AT ALL!,"I agree 100% with Ben Wing's review. The book is TOTALLY mistitled, as it is NOT a beginner's book. Unless you already have a working reading knowledge of Arabic, it's worthless. Worst $$ on a book--I was baited by the erroneous title--I've ever spent. AMAZON.COM should enter a STRONG message of caution that this book IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS.DON'T BUY IT, you're wasting your money. Sorry I did."
2,disappointing as it misses the holy in prayer,"This book promises to be an invitation to deeper connections to God, but misses the ""holy"" half of the equation. With a focus on what a person should do in prayer, it fails to articulate the contemplative journey where one is engaged by God through the art. The all too familiar myth that prayer is what we do comes through all too clearly. I think she tries to believe she understands contemplation but fails to communicate it as part of the praying with art process. While there are some interesting points about dealing with resistance and the emotions that may; arise, even the focus on these are too much on self and not enough on God."
3,I'll make this product work for me,"I paid $39 to have this product shipped to me. When it arrived, 10 of the 17 frames had come unglued from the divider. The plexiglass for these frames was floating around in the box and got scratched up pretty bad. I called Oriental Furniture to inquire about returning the divider. The customer service rep really worked with me to keep the product. She credited my entire shipping cost, gave me a discount on the product & sent me replacement plexiglass.The portrait (vs. landscapre) style frames are actually 11x14, so I will have to purchase matting for my 8x10 photos. I also had to purchase wood glue to attach the frames to the divider. I'm disappointed in the quality, but I will make this product work for me. Once I get my photos in place, I'm sure it will look great. I don't think it's worth $249 + shipping."
4,You need to flip through this book if you have a puppy,"A friend on mine gave me this book, she currently has 6 dogs and havs used this book to train all of them. I really enjoyed the book. It was an easy read with very easy to understand methods, funny little comics, and it got right to the point. Grant it my Pup is only 11 weeks old and I'm still having some trouble with a few things with her, but not much. I suggest you give this book a whirl especially if you have read other books and feel they haven't helped much."
5,Very tasty,I love a banana and ice blended d in every morning in the blender. Helps keep my protein levels up so I can donate plasma
3,Feels like your cheating on your diet because it tastes so GOOD.,I gave this protein shake only 3 stars due to their price here on Amazon. I have since found them for much cheaper so I feel that the Amazon price is a little high.
5,Shake review,Tastes great - I prefer non-fat milk instead of water - I plan to get more when I run out
4,Nice looking book,"Great if your looking for ""the"" book on mythology. This edition looks really nice, although the binding could be better. Great for the price though."
5,Reggae prodigy,This guy sings with such amazing passion and emotions that you can't help but but admire his songs.This album has a combination of love songs and conscious lyrics that highlights Frankie potent singing talents which is second to none.This guy makes something out of nothing.
1,Another Public Domain Collection at a Premium Price,"Many of these films are available in studio and restored releases ( The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, The Stranger, Scarlet Street & I believe DOA). There is no known ""good"" print of Killer Bait, aka Too Late for Tears, to my knowledge. At this price, do your research carefully, as many of these titles from the public domain are nearly unwatchable. Buyer beware, or buy the Restored/Studio releases for a satisfying viewing experience."
5,Another great book from Gemmell,"This was a wonderful book, as I knew it would be... It was sad to read knowing that this is the very last book Mr. Gemmell will every complete. As usual he delivered a book with wonderful characters, vivid battles and ordinary flawed people who become heroes. Even though a third book is in the works (I have heard that he finished most of it, and that his wife is completing it based off of his outlines) the book finishes well and does not leave you hanging. I will miss David Gemmell's writing."
5,The best buy for the money,The best buy for the money. Bought this for home and expect it to last the rest of my life.
4,Kids loved -- especially with video,"I used this for my 3 kids. The Julie Garfield videos & teachers guide (available on Amazon) were especially helpful. We watched the videos daily, which -- although not glitzy -- are of an actual classroom with a very successful teacher."
5,You will not be disapointed!!,"This camera bag is Awesome. I was taking a chance when buying it because you are never sure how good a bag will be without seeing it and holding it yourself. But fortunately i was blown away by the quality of the bag. There are a lot of zippered pockets and even adjustable Velcro compartments in the main pocket to separate lenses and stuff from each other. It is not a huge bag by any means but it fits my SLR with lens, and an extra lens no problem. Also the tripod it comes with is very, very small, about four inches tall. But it works well to set up your camera, just don't think that it is a substitute for a tripod cause it is not. Anyways, great look, great adjustable shoulder strap, great construction, and great all around bag. I would highly recommend!"
4,Bing Crosby--Jekyl or Hyde??,"What I found most interesting is how great Bing Crosby seemed with his children from the second marriage. It's pretty obvious in those PBS docs on him that are viewed during PBS' telethons. Maybe it's just boys in general that Crosby has problems in raising up to be confident, stable and happy adults--who knew they were much loved. Bing Crosby's first marriage and the emotional crippling of his 4 sons by that marriage is a tragedy. I always wondered why or couldn't or wouldn't his second wife have an abundance of love for the 4 sons. It's a disgrace to Bing Crosby's character not to have left his sons something when he died--I guess he just totally wrote them off."
1,YUCK!,"It is true that Bing Crosby was an absent father for much of the upbringing of his first family. It is true that he compinsated for this with strict rules, regulations, and whippings. However, Gary Crosby, (who if you read through the lines comes off as a son of much greater privledge and opportunity than others in this huge world) is a bit of a sob-story sissy, who never could quite live with his station in life. It's not greatly written with any particularly interesting style; but rather it is a series of misfortunes, usually beginning at the end of a chapter with a catch-line like ""Everything was fine until...happened"", spilling over to the next chapter which begins the cycle of woe all over again.Misguided, misinterpreted, and misused, poor Gary Crosby. So?"
4,A very nicely written thriller.,"Lawrence Sanders' The First Deadly Sin is a well-detailed tale of a New York Ax-murderer, and the intensely principled and dedicated NYC police detective who tracks him. The style here is so very different from that of his newer Archie McNally series, giving the reader a much more serious read. I found all of it very plausible up until the very end. It is definitely a riveting read, and I recommend it."
2,1st deadly sin,"if a book takes 106 pages to catch my attention, no. and then another 100 pages (yes, i checked) before i cared."
2,A definite dip in the graph...,"Weird band, Nomeansno. The very definition of ""inconsistent"". They're always unique, but often it isn't enough. Most of their records contain a few precious gems, buried under what I often consider to be filler tracks. Sex Mad contained ""Self Pity"", ""Long Days"", and ""Revenge"". The Day Everything Became Nothing had its title track and ""Forget Your Life"" (which was actually just an updated version of one of their earliest songs). Small Parts Isolated And Destroyed offered its title track, ""And That's Sad"", and ""Real Love"". Then, with Wrong, Nomeansno finally showed the world that they could write an album that blew doors from beginning to end. And then they lost it. 0+2, Mr. Happy, Worldliness, Dance Of the Headless... these records had their share of 'good' songs, but that's about it. As for No One... I don't hear a single standout song on this. Maybe they'll bounce back on the next record. Or maybe it's time for the Wright Brothers to finally move on to something else."
3,replaces the at-a-glance steno planner,"This is the replacement for the At-A-Glance Steno Planner that I've been using for years. It's similar in size and format, but I miss having my week start with Sunday and end with Saturday. I need more writing space for weekend. This is the closest I've found, but I'm really hoping that Mead will bring back the Steno Planner PM 1252 next year."
5,Good Product,Well if you are buying this for a teen then buy the double pedal kit because that is what most young drummers want. This however is a really good one my son bought the adaption kit for this and hauls it everywhere. My son loves his drums and was still really excited to get this one.Pacific Drums by DW 400 Series Double Pedal PDDP402
5,It's time to DVD this gem!!!,"This is one of the funniest, goofiest movies I've ever seen! Excellent cast! Had it on VHS and it finally got eaten after so very many viewings. Please, please return this hysterical timeless piece on DVD. We need to have a Fred MacMurray comedy box set!"
3,old,I've use this product for several years. This time it was very old and discolored. However it still works but not as well as the fresher product.
1,Love the product.....,I have used this product for many years and love it. Unfortunately this review is based on my experience with the seller. DO NOT order from American Wholesale. I never received this product. Fortunately Amazon refunded my money but it does not make it less frustrating.
2,Don't waste your money,This product is very dated and won't hold the attention of a small child. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.
4,****Fun Look Back***,This woman was a hoot in her day and lived for the moment and when I read Chuck Yeagers' autobiography he mentioned her place and some good times so it perked my interest so I got this to follow up on this lively gal. She was also mentioned in other test pilots that matriculated through Muroc in the old days after the war and that only added more gas to the fire so to speak and it was interesting to go back in time and check out those 'good ole days'.There is another bio in 'The Happy Bottom Riding Club' that is more about the goings on in the 40's & 50's whereas this treatment really covers Panchos' life from beginning to end. What a gal.
2,nothing wooow about it,"nothing wooow about it,itching still and my hair is falling too much,I will use it for a month if the falling continue I will stop it."
3,Disappointed,"I was so excited when this book came out. Being a fan of the first two I thought this one be just as good. It was not. The stories are much duller Bridget's story is the only one that is mildly interesting. The story I was most looking forward to reading was Lena's. I really wanted to see how things ended with her ex-boyfriend Kostos after the events of the second book. His name was only mentioned briefly in a couple chapters. I think this book had much more potential, but did not deliver. I read it quickly to see if the story picked up at all...it didn't. It wasn't the worst book I ever read, but I was defiantly disappointing."
4,Metagenics-Adrenogen,"I had some saliva tests that showed my adrenal function was a flat line (which is not good) the doctor recommended Adrenevive and I didn't notice any improved feelings for my energy level. So the doctor put me on Adrenogen which see said was the big guns. I feel like it might be working but have only been taking it for a couple of weeks. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth all the time, sort of an asprin taste. I hope this helps."
1,Warning: Do not buy this product,"When I reviewed the colorful box showing many useful features, I was especially interested in the Photo Editor allowing one to do a virtual makeover from a photograph. I fiddled with this program for several hours, and was unable to: 1) find any reference to the Photo Editor in the inch-thick manual (although it was inaccurately referenced on the Help screen), 2) download any photos from my digital camera to use with the program, or 3) contact anyone at Punch about my problem, because I could not find any reference to a customer support web site or phone number (tech support is mentioned often, but how to access them?). When photo editing failed, I tried to access other features and found them difficult or impossible to use. I found this program to be a complete waste of time and will try to get my money back."
4,Some powerful leadership wisdom in a small package,"""The Secret"" is a message about leadership woven into a story of a leader struggling with her team's performance. When she applies for the Company mentor program, she is paired with the Company President, who imparts some simple, but powerful wisdom about what great leaders do.There are hundreds of good books on leadership, but some of the best are those which take advantage of application opportunity and relay the concepts within a storyline that demonstrates how they are applied. This book does a credible job of that, although the story is at times a bit contrived.The essential message is the SERVE model of leadership. The model is simple, yet effective. Buy the book and find out what the ""secret"" of great leadership is. I recommend this book for anyone who leads people or coaches those who do."
5,Leadership,"I recommend this book to anyone in a leadership position. I found the book to be an easy read, yet strong in content. I look forward to implementing the ""SERVE"" model at work and in everyday life. Thank you Mr. Blanchard and Mr. Miller for your insight into leadership."
3,Okay Series,"This is the second book of a series that follows another series by the same author. The first series is titled Brides of the West. I enjoyed reading them, but not the best christian fiction I have read."
5,Remarkable on many levels,"It has been years since I have read anything to which I connected in this way, and I am in the phase where I recommend it only to people I very much like."
1,The reviews duped me . . .,"Swayed by the rave reviews on amazons I ordered this book and looked forward to reading it. In total contrast to my policy of the first 50 pages having to be captivating to hold my attention for me to continue reading a book I really perservered with this one - to past the half way mark and then just gave up. I was not able to connect with any of the characters in the book - all that philosophy got in the way. Sorry rave reviewers, the book did absolutely nothing for me."
1,Defective coatings,There are striped coating streaks on this filter that won't wash off. Buying cheap filters is a gamble. Won't make that mistake again.
1,Missing Parts!,"I ordered this as a gift for my 4-year-old for Christmas. I shipped it to someone in the States, and had Amazon gift wrap it. It was hand-carried to Shanghai and not unwrapped at Customs, so I thought it would be intact. But the bad news is that my child opened it this morning (Christmas morning) and it is missing parts -- the little circles in the 6, 8 and 9, and the big circle in the 10. It doesn't appear this way in the photo. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the seller and in Amazon. Please tell me how to get these as replacement parts, as the missing circles make it impossible to play with?"
5,Poppy,Got this for our Great Grandson who is almost 5 years old. He loves it. He had been drawing his own hopscotch on the concrete driveway for some time and playing on it with his friends. Now he can use this inside and outside. Great gift!!!!
4,Very Nice,"I've got a small but impressive jazz library, jazz has been a recent addition to my musical tastes. I'm not the biggest Coltrane fan, I prefer Cannonball Adderly and some others less inclined to go wailing away. I do not like Coltrane's A Love Supreme. Monk and Coltrane team up here with a very enjoyable performance. Excellent for background music or dedicated listening. The fidelity is superb, very high quality. Only negative is it's mono. Jazz fans will love this."
2,Yawning with Sir Drake,"This speaks about the 1500s tensions between England and Spain. If you liked the film ""Elizabeth,"" then you make like this. The work speaks of tensions on ocean voyages and so it reminded me of ""Master and Commander"" as well.Here's my struggle: the narrator relays fact after fact, so this work can be seen as informative. However, there was something about it that was dull to me. This was a big yawner and I can't quite place my thumb on as to why.To find old ships and record them actually sailing on water must have been an expense. Otherwise, the reenactments by actual people were cheesy and dull. The work speaks of Drake meeting indigenous people in the Americans and a Sultan and yet there are no people of color seen here, a wasted opportunity for actors of color who could use this on their CVs. The work does provide views of ancient paintings and maps in addition to the reenactments. It doesn't interview living historians."
1,Extentable pole needs a top piece to perform,I have not actually used this product since I have not gotten a required top piece. Accompanying products should be included.
2,It's okay,"This is extremely basic. Very vague. Save your money and google ""photography for dummies"". You'll get the same result."
3,Not quite Perfection,Game is smaller than expected - good for travel size I suppose. The timer in no way gives you enough time to complete by yourself. Not a bad time killer though.
2,Not enough time on the timer,"16 pieces, and only 30 seconds. Unless you are some sort of shape-sorting and placing savant, this game will just frustrate you. I bought it for my 5yr twins, but what's the point of playing with a toy that virtually guarantees failure? Spend your money on the Perplexus Maze, instead. Much, much more fun!"
1,not worth it,I bought two as a gift and both of them did not work proparly. The time didn't work and it would pop up.
1,broken,"Ordered this early for Christmas. Game was broken. The timer did not work properly,and the top did not pop up. Not happy with this on Christmas morning."
1,Doesn't work,"The timer on the game doesn't work. This was a toy I play with as a child so I was very excited to share this with our five year old. Unfortunately, the timer doesn't work. There was a small broken blue piece that was in the box. I can't even get a replacement through Amazon, I can only send it back for a refund."
4,I read it twice!,I think it was very interseting novel. First time I read it when it was published. Second time in 1992. It was fun to read. I think I enjoyed it more the 2nd time...
2,Eye candy,"Yes, this book is pretty. YES, it is a compilation of spells et al primary designed to show the author's ability to compile things.NO, it's not very useful. These spells are based on some silly ideas about how magick works, and while this book may make a good coffee table decoration, it's not a workbook and not useful as practice."
3,Pretty good...,"I bought this book, hoping it would give me more information on Wiccan spells. Although, it was helpful, it wasn't what I was looking for."
3,"The chain was broken when it arrived, otherwise the pendant was beautiful.","Although the pendant itself if very pretty, the chain was broken when it arrived. The chain is very delicate (cheap), so it was a good thing I ordered it because of the pendant and not the chain. Would I purchase it again, probably not. I'd rather pay for a good piece than receive a cheap chain - I can get my own chain if necessary."
3,wrong stone,The medal work is very nice but the stone is pink not red. I was going to give it as a birthday gift to a January birthday but the fact that it isn't a garnet I don't know what yo do with it.
4,Funn to stretch yourself with easy vegan recipes!,I have been a vegan for about a little year now and this one has been a great go to! Although some of the ingredients may be harder to find they're still really good as it pushes the boundaries of the same seven variations most American palates are used to!
3,Not as easy as it says.,My title says it all. It calls for meat and cheese substitues in a lot of recipes which I don't like. I would rather omit those items all together not find alternatives.
2,A nasty book about a beautiful city,"I'm glad I'm not the only person who really detested Paula Weideger. I started reading this book in Venice, and did enjoy the bits that taught me about the history, art and architecture of the city. However, it is spoiled by the presence of the author herself who is a highly unpleasant individual.The highlight of the book for me was the fact that her name is given incorrectly on the back of the edition that I have (she is referred to as Paul not Paula) - I bet she fumed if she ever saw it!"
1,Horrible woman,"What a horrible woman. The author. Selfish. Self-centered. Self obsessed. In all my years of reading, I don' t think I can recall an author I hated at the end of their book. Angry? Yes. Disagreeed with? Yes. But this women ... I am speachless that someone would not have stopped her."
3,Venetian dreams... of a copy editor,"This book, despite its flaws, is worth reading for its evocative descriptions of contemporary Venice. Indeed, Paula Weideger is capable of writing lovely passages filled with grace, intelligence and humor.However, she never met a comma (or an em-dash, for that matter) that she didn't leave out! Great, long stretches of prose gallop in a headlong rush without gasping for air (or even a sip of Prosecco). How did this book get published without a good copy editor? It could have been so much stronger.Plus, the book suffers from a compulsive need to gossip, about people's clothes, physiques, manners, etc., that doesn't add to the narrative. The author may have thought this was descriptive information, but it ends up sounding mean-spirited and judgmental. In the long run it's simply tedious for a reader to have to wade through."
3,Too Hollywoodized for me,"The story was good, but it didn't seem authentic to me. Was that a remake of the original? If so, I wuold rather see the original. I thought that young gal that was the main actress was the only good actor in the movie. Sorry, just was kind of an average movie. I guess I thought it was going to be more like the movie with Mickey Roark and Anthony Hopkins where he holds the family hostage in their home."
4,I like it.,"I'm not going to go into how disturbing this movie is or the quality of the acting. I'm going to express how enjoyable it was to watch. I'd been wanting to view it ever since I saw the original about a year ago and I am happy that I did. The characters were strong enough, the gore was just enough and the entire thing flowed well. There were a couple times it was a bit too dramatically drawn out, but it wasn't as bad as some movies that do that a lot. I enjoyed the movie."
3,"If you saw the first one 30 years ago, this one is good to see.","I saw the first one as a 13 year old kid at a friend's house on ON TV. So when I saw this in the 5 for $20 bin at BlockBuster I had to buy it.I really didn't remember all of the first movie, just one scene that probably will never leave my mind. It was pretty graphic.This movie follows the same storyline as the original, but has a few differences (the one scene I mentioned before is not in this one). I liked the few changes that they made as far as the outcome of the daughter better than the original.I really thought the acting was great. Seeing the ""dad"" from Raising Hope and ""Jessie"" from Breaking Bad was a surprise, and they were excellent bad guys. The mother, father and daughter protagonists are also very good.Just a warning, for those who are squeamish. I knew that the rape scene was coming and I had a togh time getting through it. Pretty long. This movie is not for you."
1,Lame. Very Lame.,"I am not sure what these folks are talking about. This new version is much tamer than the original. The rape scene is extremely short and, by today's standards, rather tame.Any indication that people walked out during the rape scene is probably phoney promotional propaganda. The rape is so quick that you wouldn't have time to walk out before it was all over. I felt that I needed to put the original on the whole time I was watching this. To make matters worse, the story freely lifts elements from ""I Spit On Your Grave"". So much so that the whole movie seems more ""I Spit..."" than ""Last House"".That's outright thievery.I wasn't shocked by anything in this picture. Its just another time filler in the ridiculous over saturation of horror remakes.Lame. Very lame.The viewer is the one getting raped."
3,"Blu-ray looks fine, the film... well, you have to like the genre, or else...","I am happy with the picture and sound quality (enjoyed the movie on a 42'' plasma TV and a surround system), as it lives up to today's standards. So no complaints on this field and a clear ""recommended"". However the film... While I love gory splatter and horror, rape 'n revenge simply is not my favourite genre, as it awakens revenge fantasies in myself :) So if your faint of heart, you shouldn't do this to yourself. still, this version is much tamer than Wes Craven's original which left me with a very depressed feeling. This one: Well seen it, but not too many images from it will haunt my nights."
5,Brilliant - Babies love it!,"""Where is Maisy's Panda?"" is one of the rare books that is truly suited for babies.Ages: about 6 months and up.An ingenious little story. Maisy, the mouse, is looking for its little companion Panda. Maisy keeps looking at all the wrong places: The washing machine, the toilet, under the sink. Little flaps can be lifted, an - oh no - no Panda! Finally Panda is found and snuggles up with Maisy in bed.The story is so simple that babies can follow the narrative. But the surprise element of the various hide outs never wears thin. And the final re-union of Panda and Maisy is always such a happy one that even the littlest kids feel the joy. Babies simply love this book.If read out loud with suspense and delight it makes the giggle and laugh.In my mind, the best Maisy book. 10 stars if they were available."
4,Hmmm,"I rather like this group. I stumbled onto ""The Show"" one day and fell in love with it. I picked up the album at work (I love discounts) and found that it was really poppy, and none too intelligent except for the clever metaphors.I listened to ""Jump"" next for a long time. I love that song. I didn't have SOTU first, I picked this one up first, so it was my initial integration into Girls Aloud.Most of it is typical pop fare, with the rock edge, that seems to be infusing European music these days. Not that I mind, I think it's a lovely combination.If you like this, pick up a copy of Lene's ""Play With Me"". It has the original of ""Here We Go""."
2,Another sub-par product from YES,"This is just one more in a long line of disappointing ""Yes"" DVD releases. It looks like it was mastered from an old VHS tape. The sad thing is that I expected this product to be of poor quality, so I am not really disappointed."
5,All is good with the universe now.,"I have had the Gold disc set of this concert for years but was not able to get this DVD. Now I have it and it is great,that is if you can get pass the horrible 80's clothing and hair. The song selection is great,the musicians are in top form and Jeff Berlin. What more could you ask for. For the people wondering what the plus in the title is for, I have an answer for you. It means they play ABWH songs in addition to Yes music. I am very happy with this purchase."
3,Zipper trouble,"This is a great bag,....except, that the zipper pulls only allow a padlock on the tips of the pulls. I always put the pulls flat together and put a small lock near where the pulls attach to the zipper. Otherwise the bag can easily be opened even with the lock on. I wouldn't have bought the bag if I had been aware of this problem."
2,very uncomfortable for serious carrying around,"Very disappointed in this bag--maybe it works for those only going from flight to train or car, but for longer hiking (and i don't mean backpacking, I just mean walking a mile or so), it is way over rated--no chest strap, poor design--i will go back to my old bag, and wish i could return this"
3,Not the best bag for long term Backpacking,"After all the great reviews on this bag, I purchased it before traveling to South Korea to work for 1 year. During that year I'd be living in South Korea, but taking many trips, such as to China, Japan, the Philippines, and SE Asia. I'd say my biggest complaint for this bag is that it does not have a hard back or any real structure to it, so it's like you're carrying a huge duffel bag on your back. I had never backpacked before so it wasn't until I started traveling and saw a real backpacking bag, with a hard frame back, much more compact and structured that I realized the errors of my bag.This bag is convenient for short trips, maybe for the weekend where you are not walking with the bag so much. It has many pockets and compartments and is convenient to pack, but not to carry. If you are traveling for a longer period of time where you'll have to be continuously carrying your bag, do yourself a favor and look for a different bag."
2,Not all that great......,"I've read every Buffy book up to this point. Both the adult and YA ones. And this one.....I don't know. It contained a very slow and developing plot. I couldn't even finish. I only got halfway through. I honestly thought it would and even could be tons better. Hmm. Very disappointing. I think Chris Golden and Nancy Holder have everything down more and it comes easier to them. Their books are the best. :) But this one. I mean I thought the ST's (student teachers) were there to cause evil to happen, but it seemed they were only connected to the monster by way of mere stalking. Kind of typical. From the parts I read, it was okay though......"
2,One of the Worst I've Read,"I kept hoping and hoping this book would get better, but it didn't. The threat to the Scoobies was not intriguing, the characters, while not terribly written were also not at their most accurate, and the ending was quite anticlimactic. I found myself skimming most of this dull novel. Only read if you're a huge Buffy fan, and do not make this your first Buffy novel."
3,Berable,It was okay but i wouldn't really reccomend it to people. It makes you fell like there should be more to it. The ending was kinda boring but the subeject is pretty cool.
1,Amazon major process error,"I have meant to make a complaint earlier than today; however, this email gives me to opportunity to do so. I ordered Emu Oil Fast Grow Shampoo-Accelerate by Exotic Allure. However, I was sent a lip balm gift set. Please send what I paid for which was the shampoo. Thanks."
4,Love the book organization,"I love the way this book is organized. I am using this as a guide to finishing a novel in 52 days instead of weekends, and this book is arranged to help me do just that. It is user-friendly, easy reading, and informative. It has provided me with several exercises that have resulted greater output. I am very glad that I ordered this book."
2,Only good if you like to babysit,"I never used the unit, instead I sent it back right away. The machine never turns off which is fine if you have time to babysit your food, but I am pulled in so many directions I would have burned my rice anyway. Also, the unit makes 3 cups of uncooked rice, 6 cups of cooked rice. That's a lot of rice for one person.I bought a food steamer, set it and forget it, and I can always reheat later if I get pulled away from the house."
2,Disappointing effort from a great band,"I was excited when I first purchased this album. After the fantastic Day For Night and Neal Morse's great solo album, I was expecting another great album. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. After owning this for about a month, I have only listened to it twice. What I've always loved about SB is that while the music is complex and progressive, it's easy to get into and (dare I say it) it's catchy. This one left me cold, and the only thing I can remember from the CD is the chorus section for ""At the End of the Day,"" and that is not saying much. If you're a first time SB buyer, go with Day for Night or The Kindness of Strangers instead."
3,"I tried to like it, really I did","But it's just failed to grab a hold of me like The Light, Beware of Darkness or Kindness of Strangers did (I don't have Day for Night yet). I knew that the final track was clearly inspired by Kevin Gilbert, which was part of why I picked this up, but nothing on the CD grabs me like the earlier CDs. I actually like the unplugged versions of some of the tracks from this album on Two Separate Gorillas (not at amazon) more than the original studio versions."
5,And the band played on......,I'm sorry but ANYONE who thinks this is not utterlly brilliant is positively NOT.At the end of the day is worth 5 stars all by itself; the rest is just a huge bonus.
2,Are you all NUTS?,"I am a huge Spock's Beard fan, but I have to say this is BY FAR their weakest album. First of all, it does not ROCK. The tunes are over-long and tedious (and before you say, well, all progressive rock songs are overlong and tedious, might I direct you to Spock's Beard's own excellent DAY FOR NIGHT, which is neither.) and they are completely lacking in the hooky, catchy songwriting that makes SB accessible in the first place.If you are new to Spock's Beard, DO NOT start with this album. I recommend any of the other albums instead, but particularly DAY FOR NIGHT and KINDNESS OF STRANGERS, and BEWARE OF DARKNESS. V is for die-hard proggers only."
3,good but not as the previous one,Yes i got it.But it seems that Morse is getting out of gas.Their 4 1st cds were very impressive and their music was new fresh and very progresive.This one looks like a repetition of the same music already done.Sometimes it made feel i just bought a greatest hits cd.Anyway the music sounds beatifull reminds me sometimes America.Its not heavy as the previous fan.Not recomended for the new listener.Better get the first one.
4,Excellent beginner's book on Dobes,"This book is great for people new to the Doberman. It gives an overview of the breed's history, temperment, care and training requirements. It touches on the different activities you can participate in with your Doberman and lists addresses to contact for more info. The health care chapter briefly explains all the major diseases and parasites that you must have your dog vaccinated against. For more indepth training methods for the novice, however, it is best to consult a specific manual on the subject. Overall the book is one of the better I have read on any breed!"
3,Good book for the beginner,"Being a Doberman enthousiast, I read every dobe book that I can get my hands on. The author is a well known and successful breeder and judge, but I was dissapointed that this book was not filled with more personal insight into the breed. If you know absolutely nothing about how to raise a dog, this would be a good book. I did enjoy some of the pictures, however."
4,More Than Just a Lampoon!,"I was told this movie didn't exist anymore and am thrilled to find it does! Marty Feldman is superb as the innocent monk who encounters all sorts of worldly degeneracy and always comes out ahead. His integrity triumphs over the greed of the televangelists and ultimately his God proves to be redeeming to the truly lost souls like Louise Lasser and Peter Boyle. More than just a lampoon, this movie is uplifting in its ultimate message. Don't hesitate to buy this one!"
3,review,book is out of date. Used it for a while then purchased the newer version. Love the book and contains so much helpful facts.
2,Enjoyed when this first came out,"This is the third book in Aleen Malcolm's trilogy of the love between Black Cameron and Sir Alexander Sinclair. This book picks up with Cameron's two daughters, Rue and Kestrel. When I first read this book 15 years ago, I loved it! Unfortunately, it hasn't aged well. Nick & Kes are violent & hit each other fairly often. Kes runs around naked ALL THE TIME & she uses sex as a weapon against Nick. The second story, Rue & Quin is better, more gentle, more loving. Even that said, this is the best of the trilogy. The other two, The Taming & Ride out the Storm have a lot of violence between the two lead characters. I wouldn't necessarily reccomend this book unless you've read the others in the trilogy & want to see how it all ends."
1,Be Wary of Tire Sizes,"I bought these tires in anticipation to put them on my Catrike 700 recumbent.First off, tire manufactures are very strange in their tire sizing. There are more than one size of 16'' diameter tires (305 and 349) and the same goes for 20'' tires. The smaller, the 305s, have a diameter of 14.5'' and the 349s have a diameter of 16''. Wouldn't it make sense to lable tires based on their US standard diameters as well as the European millimeter measurement?I don't believe car companies do this in the United States (the tires label rim size, along with sidewall and tire width), so why do bike companies mess with this?If I had my way, a 305 would be a 14.5'' tire and a 349 would be a 16'' tire. No confusion, no hassle, no problem.If you get anything out of this, check for the European measurement, not the US, as it will give you a more accurate measurement to buy new tires with."
3,Luvas' book on Antietam Battlefield,"Luvas' book provided an excellent itinerary for those who would visit the Antietam battlefield. However, it fails to help the reader understand the context of the given part of the battle to the whole. After positioning you at strategic points he simply reprints copies of the official reports from officers involved in the components of the battle. Since many officers' reports were comprehensive reports of the entire battle, and Luvas takes only a small section of the report for a given area of the battlefield, even the reports lose the perspective of context.Another thing missing is a comprehensive map of the battlefield with his selected stops, again helping show the context of a given part of the battle with the whole."
5,check out the serendipity between this and another book,"The 9 paths he investigates are called naturalist, sensate, traditionalist, ascetic, activist, caregiver, enthusiast, contemplative and intellectual. These match up well with the 9-10 mysteries discussed in ""Living with Mystery"" by Stacey Padrick. What a coincidence or is it rather better -- a serendipitous occasion!"
2,Not for the Cyclonic DustBuster CHV1408,"I bought the cordless Cyclonic DustBuster CHV1408. The correct filter for the DustBuster CHV1408 is Replacement Filter VF08. In the ""Frequently Bought Together"" section at Amazon, both the VF100 replacement filter and the VF08 replacement filter are listed. The VF100 replacement filter WILL NOT fit the CHV1408."
2,DOESN'T FIT CHV9608,"Agree with sifelaver, why is this paired with the CHV9608 Dustbuster? I mistakenly bought this filter along with the CHV9608 and it does not fit. Crucial vacuum states it works with all ""cyclonic action"" dustbusters. Well, it doesn't. I'm out $8 as well. Again the correct filter is the Black and Decker VF96. It looks like a great filter and I wish it fit my dustbuster as it is probably better than the standard filters that come with the vacuum. Now if they only made one to fit my dustbuster."
4,America Pathways,Product is what is expected. The text book did not have any missing or torn pages in the entire book.
4,Lively lessons on public speaking,"To deliver a memorable speech you need a combination of the right words and a great performance. Both are crucial, but performance often makes the difference between a mediocre presentation and an exceptional one. Author Tony Carlson has written a useful book on how to prepare and deliver a speech to achieve maximum impact on your audience. He covers all the details, from manuscript preparation to rehearsal techniques to post-speech follow-up. He writes in a witty, flowing style, and he includes invaluable anecdotes, useful checklists and a section on dealing with speechwriters. While ""wowing"" today's skeptical audiences is no easy task, Carlson's tips will help you get listeners on your side. We recommend this book to professionals who want to sharpen their speaking skills, speechwriters and anyone involved in corporate communication."
5,A French Faust Without German Philosophy,"Faust sells his soul to the devil to learn to make gold. He also gets youth, fame, and relations with many court ladies, and one genuine love to the gipsy girl Marguerite. Humour, an unexpected plot, but also a great love film. And a famous classic."
5,Great depiction of Christ,"I like how Jesus Christ is depicted in these movies; loving, wise and patient. I don't always like how the apostles are depicted. But then again, they were human. These movies are made very true to form and are some of the best I've found on the market.Just a heads up: if you want to try before you buy... I know the company offers a free movie to try. Great deal and it let me see for myself if there was anything to be worried about. I think the fighting and discrimination is sad between people that claim to believe in Jesus."
1,Dont waste your money,This toy is difficult to play with. When in place the gers dont turn and easly pop out. M
3,Boring,My girls just have no interest in this toy. The wood base is well made but the gears really do not work all that well. They end up frustrated and the peices are just thrown around instead.
3,Pros and Cons to this toy,"The good news is that my daughter, who received this gift for Christmas, enjoys playing with this toy. The bad news is that it is made of cheap plastic and the wall/ski slope will not stay closed (the toy is three days old), the darts have already been swept up in the vaccuum, the snow machine is a mess and the other ""wall"" keeps falling out if you push the jacuzzi up against it. I was told this Bratz ski lodge was more durable than the Lil' Bratz so we opted for this one - although my daughter has only used the Lil' Bratz dolls with it. Since this toy was a ""must have"" this Christmas, we paid close to $100.00 which I think is a total waste of money. However, broken and all, my daughter still likes to play with it."
1,Failed in under 3 weeks!,"I purchased it for my 10 gallon tank. Ignored other reviews thinking - its just a non-return-valve, how bad it could be. This thing didn't even lasted 3 weeks - 19 days to be precise. Very disappointed."
2,Last Shot Review,"The last Shot by John Feinstein has its up and downs. This book is about two 14 year olds, Stevie Thomas Susan Carol Anderson, who win the u.s basketball writers association contest. And the prize is every true basketball fans dream, a trip to the Final Four! Not only do they get press passes for the whole tournament, but also get to attend the press conferences ,and get the chance to meet some players and coaches. You can only imagine their excitement already. What they find is a game very different happening off the court from what we all see n the court.I found this story tho be quite interesting,but also felt as if the story was streching the possibility of what the two of them accomplished together. Although I thought the book showed great teamwork and had a nice story i would not reccomend it to you."
5,Awesome book for a major sports fan,Last shot a final four mystery was a great book that I loved every minute of. No one could sever predict the outcome with all the twists at the end. A bad guy becomes good and who you think is your friend becomes your enemies. I would recommend it to any sports fan. Great book and I can't wait.to read more from this author.
3,Not so hot,"I was really disappointed with the toy when it was delivered. The toy's packaging was taped up all over the place and the decals on the shapes were falling off. It looked as if this particular toy had been returned and had been sitting in the warehouse for a looooong time.The shoddiness aside, it's an okay toy, but not too dynamic. In fact, it's kind of a dud. I have my eye on some other toys involving shapes for my niece when she's a little older."
5,Neutrogena Product,"I have used this product for around 10 years and it is excellent at removing dead skin cells, keeping pores clean and keeping wrinkles to a minimum. I love it the feel of it and it has kept my skin looking great for all the years I have been using it."
2,Old book that is hostile to the spirt of G.R.,"There was a time when this book was probably very authoritative and useful (though I can't see myself preferring it over Hawking and Ellis, even then). Put it out of your mind: that time is gone. There are a slew of much better, much more modern books out there. Furthermore, this book is written from a perspective that attempts to filter a huge chunk of the geometry out of G.R., sullying a lot of the beauty of Einstein's central idea. If you are interested in cosmology, you can do a lot better looking at Hawking and Ellis, or one of the more recent books that will, due to their newness, emphasize the numerous advances in cosmology since the 70s. If you are interested in Relativity, PLEASE look at Schutze (beginner) or at Wald (graduate). Don't waste time and energy on this book.That being said, there are some interesting advanced topics here, and a few things that I haven't seen elsewhere. This can be a useful reference for a researching relativist."
3,Not geometrical?,"Weinberg made waves when he wrote a book claiming the relationship between GR and geometry to be a coincidence of the mathematics. But by abandoning the geometrical interpretation, we lose all intuition for the ugly, ugly equations that dominate the subject. His cursory, dismissive mention of black holes is unforgivable, and revealing of how dated a text this is. Get a copy of Schutz instead."
5,These are SO good!!,"I am a White Chocolate Connoiseur. I have trid many types and brands of white chocolate -- ""L"", ""G"", ""H"", and others, even though I am on a budget.And the white chocolate bar that I feel is the better of them all is this humble Nestle's Crunch White Chocolate bar.It's inexpensive too.The sweet creamy, toothsome, ""rolls-trippingly-on-the-tongue"" white chocolate is enhanced by the delightfully ""fun"" quality of the beloved and crunchy Crunch factor within. I sometimes like to thoughtfully eat this bar as though it were a popsicle -- lick, savor, lick savor. Bite and chew? Rarely.One is certainly never enough."
1,Setup is a pain!,"The instructions aren't quite clear in a few places--poor image views and very limited text that doesn't really tell you what or where. This lead me to install the front panel incorrectly, which is attached by VERY cheap plastic pins that cannot be removed without breaking them.Also, the ignition electrode has a wide flat connector which is supposed to attach to a round small wire connector. Guess what? flat pieces don't fit in round sockets! In trying to force the wire onto the connector, I broke the electrode. Cost to replace? US$12.94. The warranty does not cover parts damaged during setup.Keep in mind, I'm usually pretty good at these kind of projects. I've had no trouble building furniture, installing lights and ceiling fans, etc., so it's not like I'm incapable of following directions. Next time, I'll get a a different brand, if this is any indication of the ""support"" I can expect from do-it-yourself Char-Broil grills!"
1,ego-mania,"This album is painfully full of bland music fronted by apretentious singer who insists on singing with a faux British accent. He tends to scream a lot, so I can see how that can be mistaken for emotion, but it's hard to feel sorry for this so called ""troubled soul"" when his insincerity is so obvious. I have been watching this band for years, back when the drummer could only play one drum beat through the entire set, back when the singer played the guitar, instead of standing in a ""Jesus pose,"" back when a claim like [the album is probably way too deep for most people] would be treated with a laugh instead of awe. You want real emotion? Try Marvin Gaye, not this overbearing, heavy-handed, trite material."
5,Not the Christian God !,"Before reading this book I had always thought that Allah was the same as the Christian God. But, after reading this very thoroughly researched book, I now realize that they are totally different.I strongly recommend this book to any serious student of Islam. I have even recommended it to my college Religion Department."
5,Best yet from Lisa Tawn Bergren!,"I just finished reading DEEP HARBOR. It truly is my favorite of all Lisa Tawn Bergren's works. Her contemporaries are superb, but her historicals are magnificent! I love the way I can settle into the world she has created with her Northern Lights series. The only problem is that I've wanted both CAPTAIN'S BRIDE and DEEP HARBOR to last forever. Hooray, Ms. Bergren! Keep writing! I can't wait for number three!"
1,Guinea pig does not like them,"I put a orange slice in my guinea pigs cage and she just ignored it. I left in there for a couple days, and it was untouched. I wish we could get a free sample before we buy treats. Disappointed."
5,"""Once upon a time...."" Now you can tell YOUR tale.","""Make yourself comfortable in that sofa and take a look at this book."" That's an invitation I want to extend to visitors who find their way to my studio. I want them to sit at their ease in that sofa and turn the pages of a book that attractively tells how I came to transform a dilapidated 1920s garage building (the ""carbarn"") into a fully renovated and well equipped hand bookbinding studio. At last I have a book that will guide me for making MY memory book. MAKING MEMORY BOOKS BY HAND is the only book making book I have seen that presents the concept of turning your memories into a book whose very structure contributes to the story you are telling. This well illustrated and well conceived book introduces you to presentation techniques that will surely awaken stories that you should tell and will give you ideas for how to select a book form to make the telling worthy of the tale."
5,Awesome,I bought these to wear on my wedding day. They were perfect. I was able to dance all night and the shoes held up.
3,This book should be far better known,"In addition to being everything the previous reviewer said it was, its true author is Eric S. Raymond, rather better known in the community now than he was then. (""Lapin"" is French for ""rabbit"", as in Rabbit Software, the publishers.) So it should really be filed along with ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"" and ""The New Hacker's Dictionary""."
1,Pat me on the back now. K. THX.,"I dunno. Brite seems to have moved on to ""cooler"" things nowadays. This book makes it seem like she despises the ""gothic"" fan base that was intially responsible for her success. It is condescending to say the least.If you are a fan of Lost Souls, you may enjoy it, if you can get over the feeling that Brite is patronizing you."
2,What Crap!!!,"I read with some interest this book that purposrt to tell if your man is gay and/or bisexual. What wasn't boring, or sterotypical was just plain sad and nonsense. No, Im not defending men on the down low or even denying the fact that some black men have led secreative bisexual lies, but this book and the suggestions for determining if your man is gay is not only sexist in tone in many pasts but almost down right ignorant."
4,A delightful update on the author's first book,"Peter Biddlecombe has carved out a niche writing silly, amusing travel essays about his business travels, seasoned with the occasional profound observation of why some countries are hives of prosperity while others are starving. He is not among the politically correct -- brace yourself for mother-in-law jokes and snide remarks about local customs. But at his best, he's amusing and informative. At his worst, he's just obnoxious.This volume has a distinct Franco-African theme, which seems to be Biddlecombe's area of greatest expertise, and where he veers away from frivolity and comes nearest to being profound. The book is in some respects an update of his first volume, 'French Lessons in Africa.' Of 19 essays, five are from francophone Africa, four are from southeast Asia, three from South America, and a sprinkling of others to round out the book."
4,learn the techniques early,"This book is very helpful. It teaches how to get the best result in standardized tests. It is especially valuable for those students who are lack of test taking experience. My child got better scores after applying the techniques, such as choice eliminations.This book is not challenging enough for my third grader though. I let my child use Beestar (a nice Houston community web site www.beestar.org) for additional weekly practice and compare his scores with the competitive peers. His test taking skills learned from this book has been very useful."
5,Buy these with your first dutch oven,"I bought these about a week after my dutch oven. I thought I already have oven mits in the house I will just use those, then the batting in them caught fire the first time I used the dutch oven. I haven't had that problem with these."
4,It's okay,"This dictionary is an alright piece of work -- I find it lacking in historical references, and I would not recommend that one use this as their only (or even their number one) reference dictionary. I find that the Complete Oxford English Dictionary is far superior, but this one does an okay job."
4,Love this camera,"I love this camera. It is heavy duty and heavy but rugged, dependable, and takes great pictures. I shoot action sports and in particular HS football, it is awesome and I love it. So will you!"
3,"Difficult Read, good Lessons","I found this book a little difficult to read in that it just couldn't keep my attention, I generally wanted to fall asleep after a short while. The lessons and knowledge are good, I especially found the practices helpful."
3,I found nothing new.,"I suppose it does what it says it will do, but for some reason I expected something new or something more. I didn't find it very helpful or interesting. That said, it wasn't the merchant's fault; it arrived as promised, on time in good condition."
1,A Waste of Money!,"""...what you need to know to pass the GED Test"" is available online for free at numerous websites (including the GED Information Center (dot) com. This is not a GED test prep video; simply general information on the particulars of the GED tests. Please don't waste your money!"
3,Nervous Letdown,"I keep hoping that someday, someone will release another Breakout-type game as good as the all-time (and extremely underrated) masterpiece Thunder and Lightning, made in 1990 for the NES. This is not it.The graphics and gameplay in two of the four ""worlds"" initially open, Pow and Ghost, are fine. However, the boat and the school assignment worlds are silly and have repetitive, uninteresting game play.Also, there is no comparison between the quality of the game structure of this vs. Thunder and Lightning. In the older game, the types and spacing of the power-ups made each level a new experience each time you played it, and also gave you a reasonable chance of occasionally making it far into the game. The game was continuous, so you had more of a definite objective than you do here.No one should attempt to make a new Breakout-type game without studying, and, I would say, imitating Thunder and Lightning."
5,Nacha Pop y nadie mas¡¡¡¡¡,"Para los que piensan que el mejor rock en español se hace en la actualidad con grupos como Molotov, Mana, Jaguares, Babasonicos, Inspector y otros tantos, no han escuchado a los mejores Nacha Pop, estos hacian verdadera musica, sencilla pero que dificilmente llegas a olvidar, indiscutiblemente junto con Soda Stereo y Los Prisioneros, los mejores grupos de rock pop en español¡"
3,No One Said It Would Work Everytime,"I purchased this device with great anticipation of finally finding a Bluetooth headset upon which I could completely rely. Instead, I have found the nXzen to be inconsistent at best. It often takes too much time to connect with my phone (other times not connecting at all). When I have needed to make a quick, important call, I have frequently had to turn it off and place the call directly through the phone. I live in a state that will soon require hands-free cell phone use while driving. Will this device give me peace of mind? I don't think so. I must admit, on the other hand, that when it does connect (and work), the sound is pretty great. Actually considerably better thaqn wht I have had in the past. What to do, what to do. Reliability 2 stars, Sound 5!"
3,Not as spacious as described,"I chose this diaper bag based on its cool non-babyish look, and its description, which makes it seem very versatile with the expansion zipper. The zipper, unfortunately, only expands the lower half of the bag and doesn't provide that much extra space. Good for a day's outing - probably not for a weekend like the description states."
5,Great value for 3 comedies,"A little gem hidden in there, FRED CLAUSE, love love loved this movie. The others speak for themselves. Will buy a few more for Christmas gifts next year."
5,BURKE # 3 Great Series,"I can not figure out why more people don't read Andrew Vachss' Burke series. They are great stuff in the genre, darker, yes, but oh so much fun. BLUE BELLE is the third book; the books stand alone, but are so much better if read in order. This book hits a Vachss theme as Burke goes after a New York City child molester. This guy, Mortay, is really bad and dangerous. But Burke has his crew, Michelle,the Mole, and Mama all return. See New York City's nastier side through Burke's eyes. Oh so much to see. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,"usual suspects, sordid city, wierd black folks","I'm getting a little weary of Mr. Burke and his paranoia. And frankly, a little tired of the liscensed racism that so many authors of his ilk employ. Orientals are ""noble warriors"", women are ""heart 'o gold"" whores, and blacks, poor blacks have to once again take a hit as pimps, transvestites and confidence men. Vachs teases us with (in my opinion) much more interesting snippets of Burke's earlier history. When he finally tires of this formula, perhaps he'll explore that area a little more fully."
3,good cd,"i knew Matthew Ryan, but this cd was unknown to me. it is a good one, somethind Bryan Adams could be jealous of! (thoudh maybe Ryan would be jealous of the selling-numbers of Adams...)cd was in a plastic case with braille-marks on it and a sticker saying this is a promotional cd not for resale!shame on the seller, though the cd itself is ok!"
2,Mislead on Range Capacity,Disappointed with performance. Experienced several 'dead zones' for voice reception.Gift recipient will choose another product for greater range capacity.
4,Hollenthon?,"When I first caught wind of this band, I was quite impressed. The double basses were completely captivating, the complete uniqueness of the album was also intriguing. But after a few listens, I realized this isn't all that original. It's simply a re-hash of bands like Hollenthon. However is this a bad thing? HELL NO! The gothic slow rythmes, the quick powerful leads, the amazing drum beats. The mixture of growly death metal vocals and the choral clean vocals is done very tastefully. The problems I came across in this album were the lyrics, they are kind of strange, if you can figure them out :)Check out Little Dreamer, Hero In a Dream, and Goblins' Dance.Truely a tribute to metal."
5,Hope there's a Healer's Daughter sequel!,"I love Nora Robert's type romantic suspense and Healer's Daughter is that kind of book. The characters are so real that I hope there will be a sequel! I didn't want the book to end--I loved it when Judson, the bad guy, got his! Wow, what a powerful ending!"
4,good book for children about Arthurian Knights,"This is one of the ""Usborne Young Reading: Series One"" books which combine good stories with easy reading text and are for readers who have just started reading alone. Usborne Books are very attractive and quite readable. Children (and adults) seem to enjoy them. These stories of knights are based on Arthurian legends. When King Arthur set up his court, hundreds of knights wanted to join him, but they had to fight fierce giants and deadly dragons first because only the bravest, strongest, and most loyal of knights could sit at the king's Round Table. This book has three such tales: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Tale of the Kitchen Knight, and Sir Gawain and the Loathly Lady."
5,Biased? Of course - I'm the author.,"When I was in counseling during this horrible time, I outlined this writing project for my counselor. He said he could see the faces of fifty people that needed to see this book, and encouraged me to write it. It is not for the patient, it is for the caregiver. People trapped in this situation need to know that they are not alone, and be helped to find new linkages to community to replace what they have lost. If you're at a loss how to help someone you know in this kind of situation, give them this book!"
4,Seems like a good collar but haven't used it much,"We got 2 collars for our cat one, this one was good but seems to be difficult to adjust compared to the other collar and because of this ones material it was stuck in an awkward shape which did not seem comfortable for my cat. I think after a while it would be fine though. Otherwise color and quality seem to be solid. It's in my drawer and will be a backup until it gets called up from the minor leagues."
1,Does not fit all Bosch Miter saws,"I ordered this laser guide, and found that it is not designed for my Model 3912 Bosch compound miter saw. Keep in mind that this laser is specifically for Bosch miter saws. I would be helpful if the Amazon site and/or the Avenger site were more specific about retrofitting particular models. I will return it, probably without any problems, but it is a disappointment and a hassle."
2,"Nice camera, but not sturdy","I bought this camera a year ago for Christmas. I thought the picture quality was really good, however, it started having problems with the shutter not long after i bought it. I took really good care of it, until i dropped it once. The lens would no longer come completely out, so it would no longer focus for pictures. I took it apart, but it's not even worth getting fixed. I plan on getting a new cybershot so i can keep the battery and memory card, but i'm hoping another model will be better, especially considering the w80 and w90 cost less."
1,"Fragile screen, breaks easily and not covered by warranty","I had my Sony DSC W70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit. The glass itself was intact, but something underneath was clearly broken. Mailed it in to the factory service company for Sony, and I was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost $181 to repair. This is 2/3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially.I have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical Sony camera.Edit: The Wall Street Journal this week reported a recall by Sony of 8 models of Cybershot cameras for symptoms that sound like the one I had: the screen glass is not actually broken but the picture looks fractured. I will check into it. In the meantime, I bought a Canon SD200 which has been fabulous."
3,Depends on What you Like,"I bought this yesterday at Target for $36.00. I thought the price was a bit high but my daughter was so in love with it. One thing I don't like is the set of reins is rather weak because my daughter went to remove it and it snapped, breaking the front strap in half (and she was being gentle! And there's no warning on the materials that state that the reins should not be removed). Also, the apple is really small which I find annoying to keep track of. And finally, the paint on the tip of the horse's nose is clumped up and messy. I personally like my kids' toys to be a bit more satisfying for this sort of price."
5,"It's a fine song, Miss Jane.","This song is really great. Hopefully we will hear more of Miss Jane soon. Her voice is unique (slight resemblance of the Cranberries lead vocalist)and the lyrics are simple, yet very catchy. The remixes are all very good, especially the breakbeat ones. This is an awesome club-play track because everybody seems to know this song. If you haven't heard it yet, than you need to check this one out! And, I hope you have a ""Fine Day"". If you are from my area, check-out DJ Trashy's CD ""You're In My House Now"" that includes a great remix of this song. Also checkout my ""more about me"" section to find more great trax like this one. If you liked my revview, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
3,"Pretty good story. Not a favorite, but an ok read.",Rachel works for the SPEAR agency. She goes undercover to be part of a militia group called The Brotherhood of Blood. Her assignment is to become the wife of Caleb Carpenter.Sexual content: moderate. Copyright: 2001. Genre: romantic suspense.
1,very disturbing,"Am I the only one who was extremely disturbed not only by the fact that our heroine is attracted to a racist (even if she does believe he is more than he seems and ever though the reader later finds out the he is of course more than he seems) but also by the fact that he was attracted to her, thinking she was also a white supremacist. I generally love Kylie Brant and I had great hopes for this series since I love Sharon Sala and she started it all off, but if any of these books contines along this vein I will not be buying them or reading them. I could barely stomach this book."
2,"Features are not ""one handed""","I also bought this highchair because it matches my decor. The fabric is very nice and soft. I put it together myself and had a hard time, especially with the front legs. The ""one handed"" height adjudgement and recline is not one handed at all. I can barely do it with two hands. I have only had this chair for a few days and it works but is not as easy to use as the fisher-price aquarium high chair."
5,"Really good, dark progressive house.","If you are ever in the mood to jam to something other than the usual sounds of the trance and house out there, then this is the cd for you. Continuing the trend of the two previous mdma volumes, the music is intense and full of buildups. This one takes it a step further with really dark, hard mixes that pound deep bass. Except for Zombie Nation and Into my Brain, the songs are all fairly new and have not been included on many other compilations. For a similar sound, check out Plasmic Honey...their song ""The Funeral"" is included In this mix."
3,Incorrect Translation,"The necklace is very pretty, but there was glue on the charm and it makes it look dirty. Also, the middle character is NOT Chinese for ""Peace."" It actually means ""goodness"" or ""politeness,"" which is still a good message. The first and last characters are translated correctly, the middle one is the only one that is wrong."
2,Not So Fast,My Lumix TZ5 came with a Dolica camera case and 2GB Kingston SD card with the Dolica logo (no speed indicated). I got the Adata class 6 turbo and tested it in the camera at high burst speed against the Kingston. I got 26 pics before pause with the Adata and 75 pics with the Kingston.
1,Card Failure Common,"I'm not sure why A-Data can't make a card that doesn't fail so often. Cheap enough, but the warranty system is a little complicated, and replacing junk with more junk doesn't really cut the mustard."
2,un secreto a voces,i bought 2 cd's of the same title one was all mestup but did not have to time to returned i don't think is nice at all
5,A must read!!!,"A search for identity through the poignant stories of young Asian Americans. The selected essays unfold the Asian American experience with a remarkably inclusive approach. Asian American X tackles essential topics of race, religion, class, gender, and sexuality, as it reveals and reveres a spectrum of unheard voices. This search for Asian American voice breeds understanding, and emphasizes the depth and energy of our American culture. These young authors should be praised for their commitment to a timely dialogue."
2,Kicking that dead horse!,"This book contains a lot of useful information, but prepare to do some reading! In addition to beating around the bush on every subject related to reloading, the little side stories really don't add anything to the content relating to the actual subject. Look at Metallic Cartridge Reloading for a ""just the facts, Ma'am"" instructional text on reloading - devoid of the useless babble this book contains."
4,"music is a candle, is a portal to God","This CD was mailed to me right here in the middle of a stressful time in art college- I have escaped into it every evening, and even brought it to listen to in my studio. I am an avid follower of the Pasley's, and their hearts, and the hearts of the other people on this album are so sincere and beautful. Tracks 5, 11, and 14 are my favorites!"
5,Profound and Simple,"A Fish Named Ed is a book on grief and loss. This children's book can be used in homes, hospitals, and hospices anywhere. It touches the heart and inspires the soul to heal as life's challenges encourage us to find Divine Guidance within that place of attention inside us only the soul can journey into."
5,Perfect Understanding,"For anyone looking for a good introduction to Freud's thinking and writing, this is the place to start. Good not only for college students but for those with general interest, this really helps one access an important historical idea and way of seeing the world."
3,Better to order directly through Novica.,"I tried to order this item through amazon.com. Novica couldnot fill the order, yet amazon still charged my account.Several weeks later, and a lot of hassel, I'm still waitingfor amazon to refund my account. The NOVICA REPRESENTATIVESUGGESTS ORDERING DIRECTLY THROUGH NOVICA instead of throughamazon."
4,An invaluable tool for interacting with people!,"This book is incredible!!! It sheds a new light on how to interact with a variety of people. After reading this book you will truely understand the ""different strokes"" that ""different folks"" have and how to effectively communicate with them. Applications of this materail is relevant in your personal life in addition to your professional life. If you want to grow your communication and listening skills--don't pass this one up!"
3,"Looks cool, functions alright.","Priced alright, but functionality is only marginal. I gave it 3 stars because I got it for $5 back in the day, and it's worth about that, since taking one to the jugular still hurts like a mother with this thing on."
3,Liketh'm,"I bought this to keep my throut from cold elements in winter. I tried it on and it fits my neck well, but would be better if a little longer."
4,Comforable and does it's job.,"This thing is comfortable to wear, AND most importantly, it saved my neck the first time I wore it."
3,Flimsy filmers,"Swinscoe and co offer an album of side dishes, proving that a disc of fluffy appetizer's still leave you hungry for more, especially when you know what the taste is like. This continues a seemingly self-indulgent creative decline after a brief two-disc smashing introduction. The music is pretty, though shallowly so, with little to no backbeat supporting the bloated minimalism."
2,"GINGER GROUND FRESHLY PACKED IN LARGE JARS, spices, herbs, seasonings",The ginger is not strong enough - have to put a spoonful to get the taste.Mccormick ginger is so much better -just a pinch is enough.
1,My hopes dashed,"I had high hopes for the Kensington iPod FM transmitter and I was very excited when it arrived. Alas, my hopes were dashed when I tried it out and checked its reception on each of the eight positions that this product allows. On each there is constant interference, poor sound and often, complete loss of the signal. It was unusable. I should mention that I live in a large city and there is probably a lot of congestion on the FM radio, but there wasn't any position that delivered even mediocre quality. Guess, I'll have to continue breaking the law and listen to my iPod through headphones while driving....."
1,Doesn't work,"I had reservations when buying - according to online reviews many of these devices seem to be defective (the Belkin as well). I purchased anyway and my fears were confirmed. LEDs do not light, does not transmit on any frequency. Manufacturer representative (from India) confirmed that it is defective. Return will be time consuming and frustrating, but $50 is enough to make me endure even more pain. Don't buy this item."
3,Very Staticky,"I live in the LA Area and there is not a single frequency on the device that is not in use. When in use, static is very common."
1,Don't waste your money,"We ordered two of these, one to be used with an Ipod and the other with an Ipod Nano, the reception stinks on each station."
4,better than most,"Like all FM transmitters, the sound is not perfect, but this one is one of the good ones. The charging is a nice feature. The volume could be higher because it is a little lower than FM stations (the volume control on your ipod does not control the transmition).The, plug fits perfectly the ipod (some cheaper transmitters no not fit as well). I've tried the product in crawded cities like Chicago and St. Louis with no problem at all."
4,EXCELENTE,This is an excellent CD. A must buy for all the latin music lovers. They mix several latin styles of music very well. When you listen to the CD your body starts moving and dancing without you even knowing it.La Cita is an excellent song.
3,Some real review,"According to the author this book stands to help novice and experienced NT administrators. I don't think even novice admins would find this book useful, nothing new at all even for me. I also tried it preparing for 70-067 exam and can't recommend it as a study guide ( that's for sure ). Interesting style but I didn't like it. For a conclusion, you can try it ."
5,Just get this CD and you will be happy,"Ralph Stanley is a God of bluegrass and this CD shows us why. The man's voice has such character and presence and power. The music is as good as bluegrass gets and the harmonies are great.There is a good variety of music on this CD. From barn burners to slow mournful dirges, its all here. You wouldnt think that an album full of songs about death would be uplifting, but it is.Highly Recommended!"
1,The Record of Tired Noises,"This is a really terrible band. I have now seen them twice. When joking with the bassist (this was before the show. I, being ignorant, did not know I was talking to the bassist) I asked if I could throw the cd at the Stratford 4 while they were playing. The bassist handed me a cd and said, ""take one..and if they're not good, toss it at em."" I really wish I had. I saw them recently opening for Pedro the Lion at the Great American in SF..and I don't see what folks see in this band. Terrible songwriting and terrible musicianship. The first song is ok for a bit...but after that...downhill. Go get a different cd."
2,what an ironic title,"i'm dreaming. i remember fondly when i was in high school and would save up all my money to buy records that sounded new and exciting and most of all ALIVE and most of these groups were guitar groups from britain that had taken the parts of american bands that they liked the best like dinosaur jr and sonic youth and flaming lips and pixies and of course velvet underground and then turned it inward and dreamy and druggy all at the same time and that begat bands like boo radleys, ride, my bloody valentine and swervedriver just to name a few, and some people used to call this type of rock n roll DREAM POP or SHOEGAZE (but you and i know that it's really all rock n roll right?) well this stratford 4 group (no confusey with spacemen 3 please!) is trying so hard to do this dream pop thing they forgot to write songs but they put in all the noisey guitars and tremelo and delay and boy they know how to work those pedals!"
3,Cute collar. Not for small cats.,"I thought this collar was very cute, and it was advertised as a cat collar so I bought it. However, I have a small cat; she is about 9 pounds. The collar was huge on her. I hade to cut off about 2 inches and pull out a rhinestone with needle nose pliers to make a hole for it to be small enough for her. If you have a small cat you may have to do a little work to make this collar fit."
5,MASTERclass,"HBO must once again be commended for a movie as unexpected and as pleasurable as any seen in recent months, on the big screen or on TV. There is enough in the inspired Sarandon-Fiennes performances to recommend it, in the apt and character-driven dialogue which make this more than your conventional TV bio. There is also Bob Balaban's knowledgeable direction, as well as the choice soundtrack which - both in the jazz instrumentals as in the (unfamiliar-to-me) Peggy Lee: 'I Love the Way You're Breaking My Heart' - becomes as revealing of the characters as does the narrative itself.Given the expediencies of movie industry, 'Bernard and Doris' regrettably went directly to television. It is unfortunate that many like myself can expect to experience these treasures only by chancing upon them while surfing through cable."
3,Love everything but the zipper,"I bought this as a gift for my fiance. We had purchased the same jacket a year ago, but had zipper issues with it immediately and they had no more in stock. I had been hoping it was a problem with just the one jacket, but this one has zipper problems as well. If you don't hold it a certain way, the zipper will get stuck at the bottom. Very frustrating because it is such a nice jacket otherwise. Was very happy with everything else. Jacket shipped fast."
2,"If you want to crush, it works","But for slicing, it definitely doesn't. I have tried it several times, and each time the garlic gets crushed instead of sliced. The problem is that the holder is so hard to move back and forth, so it ends up smashing the garlic.Not worth it."
2,Did not come with terminators,"I don't know if the product description is wrong or if I just got unlucky, but there were no terminator blocks in the package I received. These flat wires are pretty difficult to attach to anything without them. Had I known they don't come with terminators, I may not have bought this - or, at least, would have bought some terminators so I wouldn't have to wait another week to try using them."
3,Definitely Not GR1,"A lot of the 3 star reviews listed here are ""spot on"" as our British friends would say. The concept of moving your 2 teams into position (like in GR1) to take out a target is NOT present in this game. I stopped sending guys to the left or right because it was mostly a death sentence for them or myself. I kept the team tight in the hopes that they would hit targets that I either missed or didn't see. But the most disappoint event came at the end of the game. I was in a huge firefight when command told me that an ""event"" was happening...I prepared for it by switching weapons and fired 1 shot...and next thing I knew the mission was over I had won, game over. I thought ""HUH?!? you got to be kidding me...this game was really hard for me and THAT'S how it ends?"" I'm still in a bit of disbelief and want to check a strategy guide to see if there is more to it. Maybe events happen because I was too cautious? I don't know."
4,A Good Game That Should Have Been Better.,"The first ghost recon games had a really good single player mode. They took place in jungles, desserts, and cities. The story line was good just like the ending. But in Ghost Recon 2 the single player mode is a little confusing. In some levels you play as a team with three other ghosts, but in other levels you just play as one soldier.(that mode, by the way, is called Lone Wolf) So that is kind of unrealistic. The American Army would never send just one soldier to do such an important task (unless the soldier was a secret agent) but The Ghosts arnt secret agents, there not someone like Sam Fisher, They are highly trained slodiers though. The mulitplayer is a very good mode in Ghost Recon 2. The local split screen multiplayer is just as good as on xbox live. Overall I would give this game 4 stars."
3,Different than GR 1.,"While this game may have great appeal to many gamers, it does not have the same feel as the first game. In GR1 your path to your objective was open, but in this game you are tied to a linear path, thereby triggering ""actions"" at certain points. This game is much more of a ""shootem' up"" type game.......gone is some ability to use intelligent and varied approaches. There are other things missing in this game that were in the original, but I have to say something positive about GR2 also. The graphics are better, and........????......well, that was the only thing better for me. Hey, you may love this game, but if you're expecting gameplay like the original, then GR2 may disappoint you."
2,Nothing like GR1,"They took away the actual squad based tactics and so it's just an FPS with some stupid AI guys that follow you around and die easily. The brilliance of GR1 is that you are the whole team of 8 guys. All of them. If one takes a round you toggle to the next guy. In GR2 you are just you. When you die, mission over. If your teammates do stupid things, you cannot toggle over and fix it. You have to try and ""command"" them to be smarter. This rarely works and you end up solo pretty quickly.Bottom line it's just not fun."
2,BAD!,Graphics-5Replay value-3Plot-2Realism-2You don't even notice the plot and your dead in three hits!You don't even have a health bar!And there's no blood!
4,"Red Hot, oh yeah!","If you want to see someone play some amazing hot licks for just inspirational purposes, then this will wet your appetite. If you want to play this way, then get ready to give up your life, and spend 10 hours a day practicing like a robot. No guarantees with that routine either. Some people are just physically gifted. If you practice your scales, arpeggios(with your eyes closed), and learn some harmony, you could be happy. You won't be Scotty Anderson."
3,It could have been brilliant,"The premise of Fade Out is that a spaceship arrives in the Earth's orbit. Interesting start, because you probably wouldn't even look at this book if you didn't have a passing interest in this topic, or at least the idea of ""Are we alone?"" and/or ""Is there a smarter race out there than us?""I really enjoyed some parts of this book but at others, the pace is kind of slow. There are also some really irritating bits. For instance, I thought the description of the spaceship was very cliched - imagine a ""flying saucer"" and you've got it; the disappearance of a couple of people is never explained; and the ending is a major cop-out and really disappointing.To summarise, this is a book with some interesting ideas that are never fully developed. That's a shame, because it could have been brilliant."
3,I checked to see if someone had ripped out the last chapter,"After reading all the 5 star reviews, and having loved the Amtrak Wars (vols 1-6), I was really looking forward to this book. I enjoyed Fade-Out but what happened at the end? I found the ending extremely unsatisfying, I even checked to see if someone had ripped out the last chapter of my book. I would have liked a little bit more explanation (or even any). Anyone can write an impossible situation, I expect a good author to solve it."
3,Blade was much like the movie,"I thought Blade was very true to the movie, I read it after the movie came out but it was still good. I was a little disappointed that it didn't expand on some of the storyline themes like it could have....but it was a good book nonetheless. I liked the characters in the book for the same reasons I did in the movie...just basically that Blade is a tragic character really..and it would have been nice to know more about his past and his link with Whistler. A good book if you like the action type."
5,Another Outstanding Presentation from David Attenborough,"This is another outstanding presentation from David Attenborough.This presentation takes a look at the lives and habitats of some of the worlds most amazing animals such as polar bear and leopard, humpback whale, crocodiles, wolf to eagle, and other Wildlife Wonders.This (Wildlife Specials) set is for nature lovers and others who are being introduced to nature and wild life."
2,Beware the title!,"The title of the book is a bit misleading. The book should've been labelled ""The Essentials of Financial Risk Management in the Banking Industry."" I expected the ""risk management"" to be more general. Partly my fault, the book is probably not bad for someone who is looking for the specific information the book has to offer."
4,My Fireplace,"I recently received the cd ""My Fireplace"" and I love it ! This CD is so real feeling, it makes you want to stand in front of the TV to warm your hands.I know now that Winter is here I will use this CD a lot.I always loved camping and watching the fire is one of the things I have missed the most. This works!"
2,Disappointing,"There is a tremendous amount of information in this book that's generic and could apply to any dog breed. I was looking for information specific to the Scottie and was largely disappointed. When I got to the page where the authors talk about when your dog gets to 55 lbs. size, my attention waned -- Scotties are around 20 lbs. full grown! In large portions of the book, you could change the title and pictures, and you would be reading about any dog breed. The book also appeared to be somewhat of an 'infomercial.' It's disappointing in a book of this nature when one is directed to pet products by brand name, which I think challenges the credibility and impartiality of the authors."
4,You Need This,"Come In Alone is a fascinating look into the mind of a man who is trying to redefine a medium. Ellis is one of the most acclaimed comics creators working today. He hosts one of the most active forums for comics discussion on the net. Still, he wants to do more. In CIA, he picks comics apart, sometimes bloodily. He performs this autopsy for the sake of the quality of the artform. He wants people to see the pieces-the guts, the bones, the brain and heart so they can better understand this method of storytelling, and, ideally, go out and support the books that do the medium credit, or better yet, create some comics of their own.This isn't just a book for people who read comics, or people who create comics. This is a book for people who want their mind expanded, people who need a kick in the tail. If you don't love comics before you read CIA, you will by the time you've finished it.Its worth the cover price for the gorgeous Brian Wood cover alone."
4,CEZANNE FOR CHILDREN,"One of the most difficult challenges is finding biographies of the great art masters for children. Marie Selliers solves this problem for parents in this compact volume highlighting the major aspects of Cezanne's life and art from A to Z.Translated from the french, this small book is an ideal introduction about the artist's life for children seven to ten years old. Each chapter is approximately two pages long, illustrated with Cezanne's art work and the story of his life. The titles of the chapters are in french with the appropriate translations.Your child will enjoy this book of pictures and even adults will find themselves intrigued by his work. The french is ideal in introducing your child to a foreign language through art. Your child will also learn about the one of the great masters in western art. I highly recommend this as a gift book that your child will cherish for years."
1,By far the worst vacuum I have ever owned.,"I guess the title says it all. It leaves stripes of dog hair on my carpet, the fact that it is bagless means that dust escapes when I empty the canister. The design is so poor, that things get clogged in the ""s"" shaped curved area that all dirt and debri has to go through. Not worth the money at all."
1,Could have been better,"This book was OK for those who live in Montana. It seemed disjointed and incomplete. I would have liked more illustrations and MANY more examples of the fossils you could find. Some of his theories don't seem to have a lot of scientific support. (T-Rex being a scavenger, etc.)"
2,"Gives ""recipe"" that is too super-fatted!","This book has been in my library since it first was first released (1995). I have been making soap for 16 years, so this book was purchased just for the soap 'recipes', not the instructions.Finally in 2009, I used Sandy's basic soap instructions with her Brown Windsor Soap recipe. UGH! Her recipe produces a 6.5% fatted soap! A SAP calculator puts the lye required at 12.20 oz. for 5% fat, 12.33 oz. for 4% fat, and 12.46 oz for 3% fat, the book has 12 oz. I have a house of 4 men and they HATE this super-fatted soap and prefer my own 3.5% fatted soap recipe. Please don't use her lye proportions unless you like an oil-slick for soap.Concerning her cinnamon proportions: cinnamon oil should be between 1-2% to soap fat ratio, especially if it is an essential oil because it can be a irritant. Sandy's proportions are almost 4 times the amount recommended at 4.6%.Cannot recommend for a beginning soap maker."
3,Good info for the beginner,"Good book for the beginner, lots of pictures and useful info. The use of massive amounts of expensive essential oils, and coconut oil, makes most of her soaps not economically feasable however. I use this book as a reference and have combined the ideas with other type soap bases for some interesting results!"
2,Only One Recipe,Its the same recipe over and over again. The only change is in the fragrance and additives. Did I use this book no I gave it back to my neighbor. I did a better job finding how to make soap on the internet. Doing a search on soap making.
3,Not Enough Details,I expected more from this book. The author doesn't give enough instruction or details on how to hand color just briefly mentions technique along with some photos. The book is nice for general introduction purposes but I had more questions than answers while I was reading.
4,cool game,I gave this a 4 cause 1 and 3 are just better sorry 2. I love Xenosaga theyre arent many games out there with great storylines like the xeno series its too bad they only made 3 since it was suppose to be 6 but anyway a good game not as great as 1 or 3 but still good and you may wanna buy this anyway or else you'll get confused cause this game gets confusing at times.
3,Continues the Saga nicely.,"Some things bothered me. Change in character models, and switching up the voice actors is a big annoyance to me. The battle system is kinda of odd too. I enjoyed the first one a lot more."
3,A Big Step Backwards,"Pros: Interesting plot, memorable characters, memorable locationsCons: Only 1/3rd of the series, music is awful (sounds like Sega Genesis), character interaction is bizarre and lifeless, awkward voice acting, long loading times, uneven difficulty, irritating battle system, poor character designs, tedious and and unsatisfying sidequestsOther thoughts: This game is pretty bad - a step down in nearly every way from the first game. If you enjoyed Episode I and want to see the series out, you should note that Episode III is the best in the series. Unfortunately, in order to fully appreciate Episode III and get the most satisfaction from the series, you will probably have to play this. I think it's worth it, but consider this a warning."
2,Didn't receive what I ordered,"I like the products from this company. However, they forgot to send one of the items that I ordered. After I emailed them, they sent a flavor different from the one I ordered. I emailed them again, and they did not respond. In each of my three emails, I identified the flavor that I had originally ordered, and so I was surprised that they could not send the correct one. I ordered the items as gifts, and so I was disappointed with both the delay and with their failure to complete the order correctly."
4,wow,wow!!!this cd is better than good at 1st i thought he was like a lenny wanna be but the truth is the boy has talent and an unique sound!!!
3,My son ordered this.,After it was assembled it looked very nice. I had a problem putting it together. The holes on one of the legs were drilled on the wrong side. Instead of sending it back I just drilled a new set of holes on the proper side and finished the assembly. It was made in China what did I expect.
3,The cube kept slipping...,"There is no way you can get all those feathers carved into the cube before the ice melts even if you put it back in your drink from time to time. None of the other reviewers liked the book either. And they probably read it, which would give their reviews more validity. So save your money and instead invest in a Fred & Friends Tintonic Ice Cube tray...the cubes are shaped like the Titanic! Just tell everybody you carved the little boats yourself. Give 'em enough gin, they'll believe anything. Certainly works for me."
4,santa suit,"Great santa suit. appropriate size, finished edges, lined jacket.....perfect for future christmas parties with little ones. Coloration was beautiful. Looked more expensive than it cost."
4,Well made ...,"Overall quality is good; however, I was expecting a deep red and received a suit that is more of a maroon in color."
3,"Pigs loved them, but there are only 5 in a bag!","I was really disappointed to get this bag and find there were only FIVE treats in the bag. I have SIX guinea pigs. My pigs loved them, but I had to chop them up to share them. I guess these are good if you only have one pig. They are on the larger side."
4,Convincing,"The Bible Code captivate all the world. This book explains how likely authentic the code are. It like a detective story. If u want to know the scientific supports of the Bible Code, you must read it."
3,this book is for Orthodox Jewish believers & excludes others,"""Cracking the Bible Code"" by Dr. Satinover is writen for those who believe that the Torah was & is devinely dictated by God himself & excludes thought from any other faith. It is an intelligent work, but not to my taste in non-demonational writing on such an important subject. I must admit that that I was looking for a more prophetic view of the future."
3,This could have been much more interesting,"I read the book in a Dutch version, it was brought under my attention by someone else. I think that there is a lot more interesting facts in there, but all that is talked about is some things that happen in Israel. What about the rest of the world? I dont think that these are the only things worth mentioning, where is the sequel?"
2,A small sample - Rather Costly,"OK folks, this is a relatively low quality starter kit from a really decent company. The Art of Shaving products in general are really nice, albeit a tad pricey. This small kit gives you a nice sample of an entire line of shaving products that work nicely together. The full sized items will cost you about $75 - $100 total.The included brush is a ""toss away"" quality brush. This is not just my opinion, but a quote from the manager at an Art of Shaving store. My advice is to get some samples from a department store, then purchase the Art of Shaving shave cream (wow! a great product) here on Amazon, plus either the Tweezerman Badger Brush for $15 or a Best Badger Brush from Crabtree & Evelyn for $35."
2,EEEECH!!!,"When I read the review for this book it sounded intriguing, and even though I had never read any of this authors work before I thought I would give her a go. I wish I had saved my money and I won't make the mistake of reading any of her work again.I hated Amanda. What a wishy washy heroen. She was whiney, pathetic and just a pain in the A@@#.I gave 2 stars for the amount of time the author sat down writing it."
1,OH WOW!!!,"I usually read reviews before I buy a book, but this time I didnt. I'm so sorry that I didnt. I am only half-way through this book (and thats only becuase i've skipped page after page),so far this is by far one of the worst books I have ever read. I cant stand the characters at all. I will PAINFULLY finish this book but I had to say my peace right now..Listen to the reviews and DONT BUY/BORROW THIS BOOK!"
5,Phenomenal,"Massey Hall is one of those albums where you purchase in order to be a completist and realize that you are because the quality is there. Young delivers a great present for us, and any listener that wants to be more of a casual acquaintence of his music needs only to pick up this great cd. I would highly recommend the accompanying dvd with footage of the songs. I just hope that we don't get screwed when his archives box comes out and I would have to repurchase this and Filmore."
5,Neil Freak,"This album is great. Hear all the songs before they became famous. If you are a guitar player you must have this one. The best ""unplugged"" I've heared. He tells stories about the songs, ""Old man"" and ""A man needs a maid"". My personal favorite is a song called ""Dance dance dance."" I learned this one on guitar and it's become a favorite with my friends too. You need this album."
4,For Hard Core Fans Only,"Very good acustic concert, very simple and intimate.For fans only, not an essential album."
2,"great material, dvd?",This is a stellar performance but there is something wrong with the enclosed dvd. First - it doesn't play on my PC but it does on my dvd player. I have a very high level of technical ability and I have tried 2 different discs but there is something wrong with the encoding. Also - some of the dvd is a slide show apparently because someone didn't think the video was up to par. I know the source is over 30 years old but the slide show is cheesy and is not mentioned in the promo material.
1,Buyer beware,"Featuring Denyce Graves on the cover was a smart move for the marketers. Just twenty per cent (3 of 15) of the offerings feature Ms. Graves. Her work on the album is wonderful, and some of the other pieces have their appeal, but if you are looking for a Denyce Graves concert, you will need to look elsewhere."
5,An excellent product,"I bought this radar gun with some hesitation because of a couple of negative reviews. I put it to the test and was very pleasantly surprised!! It worked flawlessly on every pitch of the baseball, and was easy to use. The only slight problem is that the trigger is very sensitive. If pressure on the trigger isn't applied to the correct spot, the gun will not arm. Once this is learned, it is easy to do and it works very well. The ""armed"" alert is in small letters on the upper right hand corner of the display, and if one did not read the instructions properly one could miss this very important item. Just pressing the trigger normally as you would with any other such device will not necessarily arm the gun. At first I thought the gun was not working. You must apply the pressure to the trigger exactly right, or the gun will not arm. This was simple to learn. This gun is lighter, easier to handle and carry, and cheaper than all of the competitors."
4,Accurate...,"This is a pretty accurate radar gun for baseball, as far as I can tell. If you follow the directions, and are as close to the action as possible, and at a ""straight on"" angle, it looks like its correct in the + - 1 mph statement. However, this is a cool gadget, but if you are serious about ""speed"" and would like more versatility, then your going to have to go with the official MLB JUGS gun...but at a much higher price.good luck."
1,FULL OF FOUL LANGUAGE,"THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.QUOTES: Damn It!What the hell!Heard her midterm is a real bitch....sorority nude beer bash.College is just high school with ashtrays.Oh God! I'm so stupid!After all hell broke loose...If you need inspiration, I'm getting naked down here.Didn't you get your ass kicked enough the last time?"
1,Extremely disappointed,"I too got this movie for my young child. Happy Birthday to my son when he couldn't even watch the movie he got. The movie had bad language and a female actually tried to coherse a man by saying I'm waiting for you naked. I doubled checked the box for the rating and it said tv/pgv, parental guidance, moderate violence. I picked this movie up in the kids section at Best Buy, right next to Bratz movies and teletubbies, just to name a couple. It was so sad to have to turn off his new Spidey-Man movie. :("
2,Disappointing,I wish that I had read the reviews for this book before purchasing it. I saw the book on a list of recommended books and decided to buy the book on that basis. The book consists primarily of quotations and queries with no discussion or analysis. One of the worst book purchases that I have made.
3,A good starting place,"I found this book a good starting point for anyone interested in the field of neural networks. It covers everything from how the brain works to neural nets to consciousness to philosophy. It mentions a lot of neural net researchers names so that you can look futher into the field.On the other hand, a book this thin can only cover these subjects in the same way, thinly. If you want to get more complete reading on how the brain works read someting by Daniel Dennett or Stephen Pinker. The philosophy in this book is covered much better by Talbot Taylor. Like I said, it is a starting place.One last thing, the book is written in a sensationalistic style. The authors have writen a few times that 'this theory is not accepted by most researchers', but don't say why. It was much like reading a book by Von Daniken."
5,love it,"i do electrical work and this is a must have for me.very nice and strong , will go through any wall without any issues."
4,2 bits not 1,make sure when you get your order of this set of bits that you actually get 2 of them. in the description it says it is a 2 pack multiple times. i only got 1 bit. i called amazon and they confirmed that it is supposed to be a single 2 bit pack. so they are overnighting me the other bit. thankfully amazon has great customer support. besides that the price for these bits in awesome. i called around and everywhere else wanted atleast $100 for just one bit. also the hc5091 has a 16 inch cutting section not an 18. i have not used the bit yet. i will comment back later after i have used it.
5,The most complete North American reptile and amphibian book.,This book contains 657 full color pictures of over 470 species of reptiles and amphibians in North America. It covers from habitat locations to breeding and feeding. This is a must for any child or adult who is interested in our native animals.
5,Great book to take on hikes,"The best way to find out habitat, breeding seasons and diet of any Reptiles or Amphibians you find."
2,Wrong content on DVD,"This DVD is labeled ""Get Your Balance Back"", but actually contains ""Biomechanics for Strong Bones"". I'm sure it's a simple labeling error. I won't return it because I am interested in the Strong Bones content, but I hesitate to reorder ""Get Your Balance Back"" because I may get another misprint."
2,The Politics of Garbage,Dissapointment Dissapointment Dissapointment...this cd is the worst Paul van dyk cd ever..wanna know why? because he only produced 3 tracks! Bleh! What made out there and back so amazing was that Paul van dyk had total control...but i lost faith in PvD after this cd...dont waste your money on it...this compilation sucks
1,Trance:Curse of the Gods,Please save yourselves from buying this CD or any related material. Easily mixed by DJ's with no imagination to fill the void for eleventeen year old noodles on too much mdma. Please do the world a favor and un-hype overpaid club dj's that play nothing but anthem after mind wrenching anthem.
5,GODLY MUSIC,"Finally Paul Van Dyk produces a cd which contains music, not his own. The playlist is mindblowing...the cd is a trip to euphoria...Easily one of the best Electronic CD's out there...My favorite tunes are...CD 1Ashtrax - Digital Reason (beautiful start to great compilation)Jokerjam - Innocence (nice mix)PvD - Vega (this song is sooo awesome)Iio - Rapture (this song needs no introduction)PvD - Autumn (probably the best track on this CD)Cristalle - ViframaEmpire - Second SunCD 2Massive - Ralphie B (an incredible song - though pretty old)Questions Must Be Asked - David ForbesInterference - ConnectorSecrets & Lies - Blank & Jones (a great PvD mix)Reach Me - Lexicon 4 (U have to listen to this one...awesome)Into The Night - 4 StringClub Attack - Solid SleepStarchildren - Guardian of the EarthDreamland - Nu-NRGFinally, for all trance fans...I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD...GO AND GET IT."
3,only if you have money to waste,"This is the first Van Dyk Cd I brought. After hearing from friends that Van Dyk was good, when I heard this set I had second thoughts about ever buying a set from him again. This set is ok and that is if you have money to spend. Some tracks I like only if they were longer and mixed a little better."
3,Some deep grooves spoiled by lashings of Euro club,"...The first CD pumps because Van Dyke avoids the worst cliches of Euro trance/pop. Van Dyke is superb at using layered synthesizers to create depth and excitment ... delivering searing synth bursts that are not at all cheesy. He can squeez extra adrenaline out of each beat, and there is a deeply satisfying ""whomp"" texture to the bass on this mix that will have you bouncing in the car. Thus side one is a powerful, keyboard pulsing journey into deep trance, sounds quite different from most US based mixes--because of the emphasis on synths--and belongs in your collection.But side two dips suddenly, and fatally, into a pool of frothy Euro fromage. Note how almost every track on Disc two begins with some cheesy repeated ""Euro"" synth riff, and continues with some sappy melody of the same. This ruins the following groove, and some of the grooves are good. ...Meanwhile, play Disc one in the car, loud, and enjoy, its a true stand out from the crowd."
2,It's okaaay.,"I am a trance DJ and know my trance well. Paul van dyk is an amazing artist, a successful producer, but an average DJ. There are a few outstanding tracks, but all in all most of the songs build up to nothing. When I listen to this CD, I find myself skipping through half the tracks.my analysis: Very melodic trance not as cheesy as a lot of mainstream trance, however still a little bit cheesy.Don't ever even try to compare this album to Out there and Back."
5,this is a Masterpiece,"this time paul ABSOLUTELY rocks,,this is the ultimate club/trance remix compilation which deserves the respect of everyone who loves electronic music..you'll enjoy it over, and over, and over,,"
1,Great until I washed it!!,"I thought this hamper was really cute and I absolutely loved it. If you have a baby, you know that poop, spit-up, and other fun stuff can go everywhere. When I tossed a poop-stained outfit into the hamper, it (understandably) rubbed off through the mesh inner bag onto the green fabric. Since it has velcro to remove and wash the outer green fabric, I did just that, following the instuctions exactly. It shrunk up so much it won't even fit over the wooden frame, so now I have to throw the whole thing away.So, if you think you can keep the DIRTY clothes hamper completely CLEAN, then it's great. If not, then you're throwing your money away."
2,Sorry Charbroil I'm Getting Me a Webber!,"I was very excited about this grill purchase but after a year, I'm giving it to my neighbor and I'm getting me a Webber. I was very dispointed regarding this grill. Way to many flare ups, lots of hot and cold spots, it takes for ever to clean this grill too. The igniter works sometimes but most often it doesnt and the worst part is the burners. Burner 1 gets a flame from only one side, Burner 2 works like it's supposed to, Burner 3, I need to use a match to get it to start.Not impressed, I'm going to Webber."
2,Why did I bother.,"Having watched this movie many years ago I thought it would be just as good but I found it dated and boring, except for the music."
4,A LOOK BACK AT THE ROMANTICISM OF THE FIFTIES!!!!!!!!,"The story is definitley indicative of the fifties. I thought the casting was perfect! Dorothy McGuire and Richard Egan were wonderful as reunited lovers, trying to guide their respective children into not making costly mistakes. Arthur Kennedy and Constance Ford are excellent as the unhappy spouses. The mores of that era are well portrayed throughout the film. The Hunters and the Jorgensens stay together for the sake of the children. Molly and Johnny, the teenagers, exhibit an air of innocence about their sexuality at the outset of their relationship. When all is revealed at the end, the sensible parent of each child is there to guide them with support and wisdom. Many say it is a soap opera, but it does deliver a message - parental support and how important it is!!!!!!! The music of Max Steiner is absolutely magnificent, and set against the Maine coastline, the combination of the two is unbeatable! A must see film!"
4,The charm of the soaper,"Now far from the scandalous, critically reviled exposé of sexual intrigues, that surrounds a little hotel in Maine coast, A summer place remains as a fine, beautifully designed melodrama, with a touching look at the sex awakening. Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee are at their best and most sensitive as two youngs lovers, confronted with puritanism of her mother (a campy Constance Ford) and the illicit liaison among his mother (Dorothy McGuire) and her father (Richard Egan).Often stridently melodramatic, but always lovely, with the now-legendary Max Steiner score, a sure delight for buffs of kitsch gems."
5,A MUST OWN,"This is one of the most amazeing concert videos I have ever seen! Fripp is a magician on the guitar. All of your favorites are on this video from all the ""colored"" albums. Back in 1994 I paid $85.00 for this video an it was worth every penny."
2,A ring ...,"The ring was okay. I was not exactly what I was expecting, but for the price it was fine."
3,nice,"the ring was nice but the way it looked online ----I thought the stones were going to be bigger----they are very tiny---I think they should be bigger----after all they are not real genuine stones----dont know if I would order again-----lots of other places that might give me a bit more for my money------thanks, jane"
1,Ouch Rash,"Gave me a horrible rash every time I wore within mintues. I am inclined to think it is cheap metal, as sterling silver doesn't give me a rash. Disappointing."
2,Not worth the money,"This book contains very little practical information on staircase construction and assembly. Most of the book consists of stair tables ( 95 % of it ) for stair layout which any competent carpenter can figure on the job in a few minutes.While the tables are complete and may save a little time,the few sections on stair layout and assembly are limited in scope and vaguely written.If you want to learn more about staircase construction,save your money and pass this one up!"
2,stair builders handbook,"Didnt care for the book,drawings were horrible and about the only thing its good for is the stair tables.basically no information on how to do cleated or dado stairs which is what i was trying to do."
1,Wrong book sent....,"You have sent me the wrong book.Instead of the ""Stair Builders Handbook"" I was sent a Sarah Dunant book..""In the company of the Courtesan.Please respond/and send the right book.Thanks.I realize this was a mistake."
2,Great Except for the Rust,"I love cast iron teapots. They keep the tea warm for hours and the tea never gets bitter. This was a beautiful teapot and it's great that it comes with cups, but the tea basket inside rusted after only two brews. I exchange the tea basket, but again it rusted. I'm trying a third exchange and this time with a completely new teapot, but if anyone wants to avoid this unfortunate hassle I'd recommend different brand of teapots."
5,Nicely Done - Worth Watching - A Good Scare,Wow. I just watched this film because of the other reviewers' positive comments. It really is well done. The acting is very good and the story hung together. That old building turned dorm was such a great creepy setting !! I was very pleasantly surprised (and scared haha!!). Definitely worth seeing ! And thanks to everyone for taking the time to write those reviews. I too am surprised this film hasn't gotten more attention.
3,Typical Student Housing...,"Four college students (three girls and one lucky guy) spend their break in the student apartment building. Of course, the place is haunted by a little girl's ghost. The group decides to hold a seance in order to communicate w/ the tiny spectre and find out what it wants. Baaaad idea, as this causes another spirit to emerge! A darker, far more dangerous spook! SEANCE isn't a terrible movie, it just isn't very frightening. The story is OK, the characters are fine, and the ending is alright. I guess I was expecting a bit more in the way of ghostly goings-on. Worth a peek on a rainy night..."
3,Revolutionary Southern bounce music...for People's Army!,"This is like a cross between DEAD PREZ, No Limit and Outkast... There are some pro-black revolutionary PEOPLE's ARMY songs but they are placed beside souther bounce and fancy car riding songs. TAHIR is a better beatmaker than an emcee. ""Keep Bouncin"" is a cool track. ""Willpower"" is the best track! It reminds me of a Dead Prez song. There's also rowdy tracks like ""Army boys"". The hidden song is a 13 minute track that has 31 emcees... all unknown... it's crazy long.. it goes on forever. This is not for everybody. Listen to it first. Don't expect another DEAD PREZ album. They are on it but only on a couple of songs... but don't expect a South bounce fancy car riding album either..it's a mixture of both."
2,Mediocre and slow,The first three books in this series were excellent. This book was tiring. It was mediocre up until the half-way point then I could not make it through the rest. I skimmed the rest just to see what happened and how it ended.
4,Thrilling end to the endymion saga,"Ah.....Raul the mystified traveller. The saga unfolds around him,and with the naivety of an adolescent, he takes us on this, his final journey.We feel his pain when he has to continue his journey without Aenea and A. Bettik, likewise we understand his enduring love and commitment to his young companion when she explains the missing years at T'ien Shan. Dan Simmons at his titillating best, a truly brilliant conclusion to an epic Saga."
2,The only reason the read it is to finish the series,"The first two books of the Hyperion series were quite good. They were well written, some what original, and consistent. The third book began to pull consistency apart yet it was still a good read. In this last book, Simmons spends a good portion of his time explaining away gross inconsistencies with the first two books as he is creating them (the inconsistencies, that is). He does this by proposing a frame story for the first two books (Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion) that did not exist prior to his saying so in this book. There were quite a few points in the novel where I was tempted to give up on it, and this has only happened to me for a handful of books in the past decade. I was eventually able to finish it, but I rather wish Simmons had stopped with the first two books in this series."
2,serious letdown to a great series,"The Hyperion universe was one of the richest, most intelligent, and highly engaging ones I've ever encountered. Too bad that the final book in the series not only doesn't capitalize on this great foundation, but actually takes great strides to erode the millieu that Simmon's so effectively created in the first three novels. In its attempt to answer unresolved questions or plot elements from earlier books, _Rise_ either makes things more confusing via contradiction or puts you to sleep with the simplistic and unbelievable answers to what should be significant questions like ""what is the Shrike"". This disappointing book undermines the brilliant premises set forth in the first two books. It's clear that Simmons really didn't have all the answers in mind when he wrote Hyperion, and his attempt to resolve them in this book do more harm than good."
5,"re: sacred aspect of ""just kidding:""","reply to the poster below:""(who, by the way, never DOES resolve very well how he got into that stupid poison capsule thing, and more importantly how he knows the events of things outside of his experience)""simmons definately resolves these two things. i don't want to give plot spoilers, so let me just give you some keywords: Pacem.Aenea.What Happens Afterwards. the chapter right after that explains why raul is in the Schr?dinger's catbox and how he got there.and you think simmons didn't explain how raul knows all of this? come on man! lol. here are the keywords: the Void Which Binds. i don't think you even finished reading the book lol."
2,Its worth reading to finish the series,"The strongest thing about this book are the three that came before it. It lacks the drive and interest of the first two books and seems to drag out the job of completing the third one (Endymion).On the other hand, it does complete the series without loose ends. I just wish the concepts were a little stronger.On the whole though, if you liked the Hyperion series, you wont be sorry you took the time to read this one, you just may not be thrilled."
5,"A five-star masterpiece, we need new chapters of the saga","""And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make"" (The End, The Beatles). Simply put this is the most terrific action-and-love drama I ever read. I was really upset by the emotional strength of the love between Aenea and Raoul, and literally wept for her tragic conclusion. The powerful universe Mr Simmons has painted is stunning. I can't believe it's all over, there MUST be a way of saving her life and continue the saga."
3,A bit boring,"I will try to be laconic, a quality the author apparently lacks. Overall I like the story and the characters, however the story at times gets a little boring. There are pastoral descriptions that run over several pages that I had to skip, otherwise I would have fallen asleep. The science part is rather enjoyable and innovative, the part about the genetic algorithms and their hyper-parasitic nature is rather clever without getting into too many computer science details as to the nature of the algorithm, my only comment at this point is the author's obsession with lengthy forays into minutia of events which ultimately have no relevance to the plot."
3,"Not as good as ""Endymion"", but still a fairly good book","This book starts out good, and ends good (althought the end is fairly depressing), but the middle of the book plods along much too slowly with descriptions of the world they are on, and there is just far too much discussion regarding architecture. Dan Simmons just strayed too far from the main story for most of this book."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Aenea, along with her protector Raoul Endymion, must try and avoid the fate of almost all messiahs to stop the Catholic Church's genocidal military operation to wipe out all resitance to its plans, and really, the plans of the TechnoCore.With the help of the Others, a rebel faction of the Core, and a visit to Old Earth, Aenea has to come to understand the nature of the universe, to enable humanity with the power to escape AI domination, and have the ability to face the Church's Pax fleet."
2,A grinding finish to a great series,"Anyone who read Hyperion feels compelled to read all of the books in the series. The first book was one of the most creative and fascinating SF books I have ever read. Unfortunately, by the time you reach the finale, things have changed. The thick-headed, dim-witted hero, Raul, can be quite tiresome. He is nothing, however, compared to the messiah, Aenea. She spends the entire book brooding and depressed. The reader is promised that her emotions will be explained later. An explanation comes at the end, but it is much too late for me. The author, through Aenea, seems to insist that we listen to his philosophies on love, religion and technology. The scenes with Aenea teaching (there are many)quickly become tiresome. The two stars I give are for the authors wonderful efforts leading up to this conclusion. He is obviously a gifted writer, he just needs to know when to say when."
4,Very interesting for those who live on the Chesapeake,"Does a great job of explaning the stratigraphy and paleo-water characteristics of the southern Chesapeake. An easy, very informative read."
5,A celebration of June Tabor - the English Rose,"From the Queen of English folk music, this is a wonderful album celebrating the rose. It's packed full of traditional songs from across Britain and beyond. I also like the CD booklet which gives a bit of information about each songs.Her vocals are, as usual, beautifully clear and you can hear every word - and the arrangements are simple and brilliantly played (less is more, here).I don't know how she does it, but June Tabor just keeps producing fantastic albums. I thought ""A Quiet Eye"" was a sensational album and was a little frightened about buying ""Rosa Mundi"" - how could I have doubted you, June? You're the English rose whick we should be celebrating."
4,Good for what I use it for,I got this so for sailing trips. I tried sandals with the thong between the toes but just couldn't find anything comfortable. These ended up being the perfect option for me. The only time I seem to have a problem with them is when I'm trying to walk on uneven services like rocks. Other than that they are perfect.
3,"Well Made, But Not Well Padded","I bought these for volleyball, but they don't seem like they will be cushy and padded enough for me to want to fall and slide onto my knees in them. The pic made them look more padded than they actually are. I chose them for their size, as most volleyball pads don't come in larger sizes. They do seem well made, like they'll last a long time."
4,Exceptional jazz guitar,"Gil Parris comments that this recording is a departure for him, in that it is a jazz album in the tradition of Wes Montgomery. This music is enjoyable on the first time through and also satisfies on repeated listening. The collaborating musicians are excellent, including Eric Alexander. A great bargain at the posted price!"
1,Felt really cheap and poorly made,The meat grinder came without any sort of instructions. Compared to other meat grinders I have seen quality seemed below what one should expect. As I assembled the grinder it appeared that the parts did not fit. I ended up returning it.
4,Works well,"Bought a side of beef and this grinder took care of the cuts we didn't want to keep as steaks or roasts. Easy to assemble and use.Only complaint was that the clamp was too small to fit the edge of our counter which has a 3"" tall round."
2,For 60's types only,"THis film is a curiosity mainly becasue of it's use of ""LSD spray"" to cure Tommy Kirk's impotence on his honey moon. Tommy has come aways from the Mousketeer Club house in this film but alls well that ends well I guess. The production quality of the DVD is a little dark and the writing and comedy is weak even for those who like movies that are fun in their poor production quality. Add to this, the fact that Jacques Bergerac's French accent is hard to understand from time to time, make it a struggle to get through.This is not a film for deep thinkers, it is one for those who grew up inhaling back in the 60's and may play best on your dvd machine if you are in that mode today."
2,Dissapointment,"After hearing classics such as ""Arabian Nights"", ""Every Rhyme I Write"", ""5 Star Generals"" and other guest appearances with the likes of Pharoahe Monch and The High And Mighty, i couldn't wait for this album to drop. But then i heard that he had been dropped from Rawkus and was dissing them on a track. I thought that would be a problem since at the time a lot of my favourite artists were signed to Rawkus but at the same time i was aware that Rawkus had a tendancy to push back release dates so i respected what he was doing. After picking the cd up i eagerly tore the packaging off and put it in the box. After the first couple tracks i was appauled. Complete GARBAGE. It seems Shabaam is trying to gain some sort of mainstream audience, and it just isn't good for anyone. The two stars are awarded to this album for the rare jewel, ""I Still love H.E.R."" which spins off of Common's ""I Used To Love H.E.R.""."
4,me and s double go back some years,"LOOK I'VE SEEN THIS BROTHER DO HIS THING WAY BACK IN NICK WIZ'S BASEMENT, AND TO SEE HIM FINALLY GET HIS JOINT OUT....YO THIS ALBUM TO ME GOT SOME GOOD S@#$T!!! KEEP DOING YOUR THING ONE LOVE YA BOY (JAZZ)"
4,A big tricycle for kids,"This tricycle is very heavy-duty, but is a bit large for it's intended rider - my 3 year old son. Keep that in mind before buying. Took a bit of time to put it together, but it is a sturdy piece of machinery and heavy. It will be very fun for my kid once he grows into it. If you're buying for a little one, check out some other smaller version first and then graduate to this one later."
4,"Not Their Best, But Amazing Nonetheless","The great thing about Opeth is that they consistently put out amazing material. This album is no exception. It may not be as epic as Still Life or poetic as Orchid but it holds its special place in the Opeth discography. The album progressed much from BWP in the sense it is heavier. Given they only had about six weeks to record this and Damnation, they did an amazing job. The standout tracks on Deliverance are the title track and By The Pain I See In Others. My only beef with the latter is towards the very end, Mikael sings something I can't understand. The other four are very amazing as well. A Fair Judgement is a very emotional song with some of Mikael's best clean vocals. Wreath is probably the heaviest song on the album because it has no acoustic passages. It's a good introduction to Opeth's realm, but not their best."
4,Joan Collins Cleans Up a Mess and Peter Cushing Gets Hate Mail,"It's great that Tales From the Crypt has been released on disc. I can finally get rid of my old vhs tape.The film is a fun anthology; my favorite deals with the kindly Peter Cushing and his cruel neighbor; then there's a Christmas Eve story featuring Joan Collins and a psycho on the loose; also, a man in an accident gets a rude awakening; and a bunch of blind men get some revenge.This one's lots of cheesy '60's fun. A fiendish favorite.Now if only we could see a dvd release of Dr. Terror's House of Horrors!!!!!"
3,ENTERTAINING,THE TALES FROM THE CRYPT AND THE VAULT OF HORROR IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE IN ANYONE'S COLLECTION. YOU GET TALES UPON TALES OF GOOD HORROR STORIES. YOU DON'T WANT TO END.
4,Love the variety,A collection of 25 songs from all different artists and styles from traditional carols to rock and roll. Great for long car rides or background at a holiday gathering.
5,Wonderful CD,This CD is so beautiful and I love to play it every Christmas. My 3 year old son falls asleep to this music every night during the holiday season. Very soothing and makes you feel like a child again during the season.
1,Key broke...,"Luckily it was open at the time, but when I went to pull it out, the key broke in the lock.So... now I can't shut it.Makes me a sad panda."
4,So far so good,"I received this as a Christmas gift. I am using it to protect my photo negatives, home videos and CDs. When it was delievered the inside of the safe was damp and all of the contents(paperwork) as well. Weird for a ""waterproof"" safe. I dried it out and am using it. I hope I never have to discover how well it works. It is sturdy and easy to use. For size comparison- It can fit a ladies size 8 and 1/2 dress shoe box inside with about 3-4 inches of room above."
5,"Not too Big, Not too Small...Just Right!",I purchased this to store important documents. There really is no way to tell if it will work as advertised unless it's in a fire and a flood so I can't comment on that. But it is very heavy because it's lined with concrete which gives it it's protection capabilites. You can tell when the lid is shut that it is a good seal. It locks and unlocks flawlessy and the lid reopens without any trouble.It is large enough to fit many letter size documents and small enough to fit in our closet. Overall very happy with the purchase
3,poor packing,The box looks like it will do the job. However It has one corner smashed so it doesn't look good so I give it three stars. As the other review stated it was poorly packaged in a oversized weak box not suitable for something this heavy.To much trouble to return.
3,Caution: Not primarily a safe,"I bought this safe after looking at range from lockboxes to real larger combination safes - I needed something to put documents, jewelry, valuables, etc. for safekeeping from nanny, home visitors, etc. - I must say that the lock on this is pretty flimsy - it will keep out nanny, but if anyone really wants to get into this I seriously doubt it would take much to pry the lock off. However, it will keep out nanny and is the right size and price (lockboxes were too small and not much cheaper, and real safes are a lot more $)."
2,Beware! Plastic Latch! Not very secure.,"Bought at local big box club, but was disappointed in the quality of the latch. This is not a ""Safe"" as in securing you valuables. It's just for fire/water safety.On that note, the desiccant in the safe was all wet and there was water in it when it was opened. Failed waterproof check but sold anyways? I would NOT buy this safe, even at $30. I'd return it if it wasn't such a hassel."
4,Keeps you reading,"Olivia, a girl whose mother ran away and left her and her two older siblings with thier drinking father, has build a stable life around her. She even goes out with Adam, a rich bankiers family son, and gladly accepts his invitation to a masquerade ball, where, for the first time, she discovers how much she wants him sexually. After a steamy sequence, her phone rings; it's Adam, but who's the stranger with whom she just had the best sex of her life? It's his older brother Luke - who she hates with a passion.Great book! Read it 3 times!"
1,DVD Rack,"Unfortunately, I made the mistake of assuming that this product would be OK for CD's too, which it's not, so I had to return the 2 that I ordered...not the seller's fault, just me misreading the description on the website"
5,Excellent experiance.,"Took my time using Amazon online tools, and upon the suprizingly rapid delivery, found the ring to be even better than I'd imagined. Extreemly pleased."
5,Cajun self-taught,"As a native speaker of the Cajun language, I found this to be very helpful when researching my MA thesis as well as doing personal inquiries. It won't teach you (if you're not a native speaker) the language but it can teach you helpful phrases. It has taught me phrases I forgot and re-taught me words and phrases I mis-learned as a child."
3,self-taught cajun,"While the description says you don't need the book, the CD starts out referring to the book! We ended up having to buy the book. The lessons are well done for what it is. You should be familiar with Cajun or basic French for this to be much help. Either that or be VERY self motivated."
4,A powerful vitamin for everyday life.,"Mark has assembled an inspirational guide to leadership basics. His pragmatic approach is fun and easy to read. You can apply the lessons immediately to everything you do. He uses life experience, relationships, and scripture in an effort to ground you in the fundamentals of leadership. Regardless of your walk in life, this story will help you assess what really makes a difference."
1,Unhealthy Ferret Treat,"A raisin treat made for ferrets is a horrible idea.Yes ferrets love raisins, but raisins are basically sugar and they are dried fruit (ferrets are obligate carnivores- meat eaters). Due to how short a ferret's digestive system is intestinal blockage can occur when fruit and sugary foods are eaten.To top that off studies have shown that ferrets that are given raisins regularly often develop kidney disease or kidney failure.Not a treat you want to be buying for your fuzzies."
1,not good for ferrets!,"Ferrets should not eat any sugary foods, including fruit. It is not good for their bodies. My ferret was just diagnosed with Insulinoma and have learned that treats like these contribute to this disease. Why a company would make treats for ferrets that are not good for them is beyond me."
2,Broke in a day,Did not hold up well at all and the ears are very sharp! I would not recommend buying this item.
4,Geosonic Grooves Vol. 1,"A very nice flow from the start and it just keeps getting better. This is one of the best world groove mixed comps out there. I particularly like the way it has a wide variety of styles, but it still all works together."
3,[Three-and-a-half stars out of Four] Another winner from Anti-Zionist Prof. Al Lilienthal,"Lilienthal is wrong about the Nutzis andthe socalled 'holacau$t', but right abouteverything else here, on Zionism, The Pal-estinians, et, al. This book is not as po-werful as the Zionist Connection, or ZionistConnection II, but all his works as well asthose by Haviv Scheiber and Rabbi Elmer Ber-ger are a far cry from what the United Na-tions / New World Odor sycophants tell us!I suggest every Amer-I-can that has rela-tives in our military being sent over to thetinderbox known as the 'middle east' get this!"
2,Cool Phone except for the reception,"Awesome features, Very Sturdy, Sexy looking. My problem was the reception. Which was non existant except occasionally. I could never get more than one bar and if I did it was for about 5 seconds. The speaker is very sensitive and my friends complained about how loud and distorted I sounded when talking to them. I could have lived with the sound but what good is a phone if you can't talk on it? They don't sell these in America and apparently my wife ordered if from overseas somewhere unknowingly."
1,very annoying,"i bought this for my 12 month old to enjoy in the tub, at that age he didn't find it interesting at all, he is now 2 and still doesn't touch it. i end up playing with it to try and get him interested but no use...it doesn't spray long or far enough, maybe that is the reason!i wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it."
1,Smiling Maniacs,"This is a typical awful Alpha Home Video disaster. SMILING MANIACS is one of several wide-screen Euro thrillers that Franco Nero and Martin Balsam made together. It was entertaining if lowbrow. Alpha's ""presentation"" is a muddy full-frame print with stone age sound. It's a disgrace overall."
4,Straight to the point,"This was made for those who feel that songs by The Haunted and The Crown are just too long. There's not a single track here over 3 minutes in length. The only thing that keeps me from rating it five stars is the total lack of any lead breaks. But honestly, you don't miss 'em a bit."
3,Ok for family needs,the racket mechanism need some improvement... the rings at hinges are welded in point causing easy break... the half circles wood blocks need to be replaced with better material. Overall it is a good product but a bit overprice.
4,Tirbal Fusion Fundamentals,This was not too bad. I liked the section done by Kami. I am still working through Moria's section. I did find that this section is not a beginners section. The performances were great. I also liked the intro to floor work. I would have to say that this DVD is for advanced beginners not someone who is starting out. I have been dancing for a little over a year and some of this DVD is a little above me.
4,"Fun performances, challenge in strength and flexibility, and helpful information.","So far I have enjoyed this DVD. I loved the performances and the tips on costuming and makeup. I did a few of each section, some I found fun and challenging. However, I think a few of the words were off on some parts, and you can tell me if I wrong but I thought yoga was more slow paced easing in the stretches, I felt rushed on some of the yoga, but overall I think it was worth the money."
2,They no longer support this product.,"WinFax Pro is very complicated. And Symantec has stopped publishing it and servicing it.Emails to Symantec about it go unanswered. If you ever install it and then uninstall and try to reinstall, you are shafted. Some remnants of the program remain on the computer and it will not let you reinstall the program. Even the Norton/Symantec Removal Program will NOT uninstall it sufficiently to allow a reinstall.The thing about the program is that it is NOT user friendly, but you can make it work to your liking.You have to be patient and do a lot of finagling to get it right."
3,Buckland Grows Up,"I must say I was surprised to like this book. Yes it is a rehash of Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft, the Big Blue Book, but this one is done with a great deal more class and maturity than any of his previous books. If you have read the Big Blue book, you should probably read this one to see how Buckland has grown over the years. I look forward to see what is next now that he is writting for a different publisher."
5,yay,"great cookset, very professional looking and Cheap. the handles on the glass lid get pretty warm, but the pot handles stay pretty cool. the instructions say that metal utensils are okay to use, but they scratched up my pots. might be because i didn't read instructions until later and never did the steps they suggested before using the pots (coating pots with oil, heating them for 2-3 min, etc)."
1,Decent stand,"It seems like a decent stand for the money however it showed up and the box was DESTROYED. I had to get on the internet and send it back since is was missing all 4 mounting arms. Now I have to wait another week for the stand. In the mean time, my engine block is sitting on the floor and can't do a thing with it. It looks like they should check these boxes for all the parts before shipping them out. Would save a ton of time and money."
4,Great for a newborn.,"I had a preemie, so weight gain was critical. This scale was spot on for daily weights. It also measures to the 1/2 ounce, which was helpful for weighing before and after breast feeding. It also gave the same weights as my lactation consultant's office, so I think it is pretty valid. I gave it four starts because the plastic isn't the best quality ever, but what you would expect for the cost."
3,Nice to have,I wanted this scale so I could weigh my baby before and after nursing to monitor how much milk she was getting like I was doing at a mothers group before returning to work. Unfortunately it is very sensitive to movement so it is hard to get a precise reading down to fractional ounces...it fluctuates a lot unless the baby is completely still. But it is still nice to have for monitoring weight gain and will probably be more useful when she is older.
1,Sucked!,"The scale NEVER worked. It showed ""Lo"" battery from the beginning. So I purchased new batteries. Still registered ""Lo."" Called the company, and the person on the line had me take out the battery and reinsert it (DUH! Didn't I do this when (1) I put in the original battery and (2) I put in the new battery?) Okay, still registered ""Lo."" I was told to return the scale for a replacement but I needed the scale immediately. I purchased another brand (American Red Cross) at Babies R Us and it's worked beautifully from the beginning. I've returned the scale to Salter/Taylor Precision Products and requested a refund. Time will tell. It cost me over $24 to UPS it back to the company, and I paid about $37 for the scale!"
2,not correct,I was disappointed. It never tells you the same weight. It is different than the scales at the doctor by quite a bit. I wish I didn't purchase it.
1,It's not accurate,I bought this to weigh my cat but it's not even accurate. I have this at home but I drive to my vet's and use theirs every time I want to get a weight. I need to weigh her frequently because I'm syringe feeding her. This was a huge waste of money. Anyone can have it if they pay for postage. I don't have the box it came in so I'll have to fashion something together. Otherwise it just goes in the trash; it's taking up space in my apartment. Really bummed I bought this.
4,Weighing In,"We needed a reliable scale on which to weigh our overweight cat. This works very well and was easy to assemble--really nothing to it. It works wonderfully and we've found added uses such as weighing packages. My only concern is the cost but I didn't find any other scales that seemed reliable for less. So if you need a scale for babies, cats, or other items this is a great choice."
2,Let Down!,"I have been a very big guns n' roses fan for many years and i remember when this video came out and i couldn't wait to watch it. My excitement soon turned to boredom as i had to sit through 2 hours of really bad quality picture, sound and editing. This video is poor and a tragedy, as ive seen televised concerts 100 times better than this,... i dont know why they released it, but unless you're a big fan or collector, i'd stay well away....."
2,Lord help us. Rock N Roll is truly dead.,"How depressing to see such a talented band fall into the ""Bloated Elvis Syndrom"". Spoiled to the point of overindulgence and it shows. The stage is so big, that you rarely see the whole band all at one time or in one spot, or for that matter anywhere near each other. They dont even seem like a band anymore, but 5 seperate pieces floating around in nothingness. The backup singers really bring an extra helping of crappola to the show, complete with flutes, horns and all the cheeziness of a Poison concert. What happened to the raw attitude they used to have? My grandmother would enjoy this, but if your a die hard GNR fan, and you want to see them play as a band, and not a circus act than go find a copy of ""Guns N Roses Live at the Ritz 1988"". If your really a glutton for punishment Ill gladly sell you mine."
4,Features John Anderson on track 4,It doesn't get any more traditional than this. Great cd from start to finish and worth the price to hear the duet between Randy and John Anderson.
5,Stately fossils is highly informative and captivating!!!!!,"When purchasing the book Stately Fossils, I imagined it to be a great book, but surely not as wonderful as it turned out to be. Both highly informative and largely captivating, this is a sure-read for anyone out there looking for a good book. Written in a style that both appeals to fossils enthusiasts and those just briefing the subject, this learning tool is a gift that you can't stop reading!!! Especially interesting is the foreword, in which we learn of the incredible story of the author and his brother."
4,Fun memories.,"Four stars because nothing remarkable about the set. Content? Five. Loved this show. Funnily enough, so do my young daughters. More like this, please. Great idea to produce by demand."
5,Thundarrr,"The previous reviewer doesn't take account that WB shop won't ship outside the USA, making it impossible for other countries' fans to see the show.Sure I'd prefer it cheaper, but i'm glad to get it. So thanks once again to Amazon marketplace. I'm very grateful."
4,Thundarr,"A little cheesy now, after 25 years but still great old 80's cartoons. Anyone who is a fan will love it."
3,An ok start...,"for the ""Kodiak"" series of books. These books follow the adventures of cryptozoologist/Steven Segal-type George Kodiak. This book is the first in the series, and is a decent start. Kodiak goes up against Bigfoot and some very nasty people in this installment.While the main character is pretty cool, this book is more like the movie Deliverence then a Bigfoot hunt. There is also some over-the-top James Bond type of stuff involving the bad guy and his wildly unrealistic zoo.As stated above, it's not a bad start. I thought the next book in the series, Naitaka, was much better."
2,Not For Kids,"I bought this for fun--since I like both adventure fiction and cryptozoology--but it was neither good adventure nor interesting crypto-fiction. Worse, it contained egregious, non-stop violence, cruelty to animals, vulgarity on almost every page, unnecessary sexual innuendo and very little else. There was no character development (a shame, since the main character is an interesting half Indiana Jones-half Grizzly Adams sort of fellow; a character with potential!!), a cardboard plot featuring mostly predictable low-life side characters and somewhat stilted and very unsophisticated writing techniques. I only give 2 stars rather than 1 or fewer because the crypto information was interesting. Don't let your kid read this book; stick to The Call of the Wild instead."
4,Live In Texas,"The songs are mostly same. Mainly what you would want would be the Live In Texas Video. So buy the ""Live in Texas CD/DVD"""
5,FAVORITE,"This is my favorite album to listen to from Linkin Park. It has easily been played a few hundred times while in my car...I recently just had to get another one because I wore the first one out. If you like Linkin Park, you will LOVE this cd."
5,This Cd Rox!,Linkin Parks Live In Texas is one of the best live albums I have ever heard. They sound very good live and it just makes u wanna get up and join a mosh pit sum where. The DVD is very good too. The guys of Linkin Park put on a great show!! This cd and dvd are sooo freggin good that i cannot explain..u must see 4 ur self..its worth every penny!!!!
2,BORING!,"I bought this game because it was supposed to be based on the art and idea's behind the art of H.R. Giger, but once I started playing it, I found that there was hardly any plot to it. I lost interest in this game real fast. If you enjoy mystery games with a horror theme, I recommend the Alone In The Dark series. Don't waste your money or time with this game."
4,Pretty Great Little Music maker!,"I bought one of these about two or three years ago and love it. It still works great and has a terrific sound for such an inexpensive and small unit. It has a built-in equalizer and power booster which gives you a nice selection of different effects, such as cranking up the base and just more volume without getting a tinny quality to the music. There are selections for pop, jazz, rock, classical, etc. The only negative things I can say about it is that occasionally it skips and gets stuck when playing a CD much like the old phonographs with needles would do. This does not happen very often though and perhaps it is not the machine but a CD that has not been taken care of properly. Also, it can be a little complicated figuring out how to turn it on and getting the CD to start to play because there are so many buttons. Keep the user guide handy. Overall, though I think it is a great little boombox and would purchase it again. I would rate it 4.5 stars."
2,Old stuff,"I was VERY disappointed in this collection. Any true shark fan, or in my case, freak, has had most of this collection from when it aired over the past 7 years. When this first came out, I was hoping it would be all the new stuff they were planning to show for the 20th anniversary. It was not. Anatomy of a shark bite came out 2 years after Ritter's attack in 2003 or 4, Air Jaws has been out for about 5 plus years, and so on. I wanted to get Roboshark, Amazon Abyss, and all the other stuff they aired this year and didn't get one of them. If you are looking for new shows from this year, DO NOT get this collection. If you don't have any of the previous Shark Week shows, this is a great collection for you. Happy Shark Watching!!!"
3,Overrated,"I have been to universal studios and the shark there is on a timer to leap out of the water. Same one they used in Jaws I think. Speaking of Jaws, why is that shark not shown in these? What a sham!I liked that shark he just ate people and you know, was like ""hey So-Cal, stay off my beach"" and stuff. Just a lonely shark trying to get along with the world. Did you know sharks never stop moving, if they do they die? There are so many fat people who could learn from that, I don't meant the result I just mean MOVE people does it hurt that much to take a walk once in a while?Supersize it all you want bubba you will not outswim the sharks!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Average,"Evidently I've been overexposed to Steve Martin. He is still funny but if you've seen him often there is not much different about these skits, etc."
1,Please label your boxes more clearly!,"I was led to believe that this product was about best selling author Steve Martini, of whom I've heard. Not television and film personality Steve Martin, of whom I haven't!"
5,Down Memory Lane,"I'm struck by how funny Steve Martin's lame early stand-up stuff can be, but the format is what I love. I felt that I was part of the audience at the club. The clips from SLN never get old. Still wondering if SM is crazy or genius. Who cares? He is hilarious."
5,Love Steve Martin,Steve Martin is hilarious. My wife and I never miss a movie or show that has Steve Martin as one of the actors. Everyone should enjoy this collection.
3,Some of George Jones' Greatest Hits Are Missing!,"While George Jones' 50 Years of Hits is a pretty good retrospective of his career, many of his memorable songs are omitted. Tunes such as ""If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will)"" and ""Tennessee Whiskey"" are needlessly deleted and should have been part of this compilation. Some more of his tunes with Tammy Wynette, such as ""Two Story House"" and ""Golden Ring"" wouldn't have hurt, either. Perhaps a fourth disc should have been added."
4,"Good, but software needs work","I bought this after reading very strong reviews, but I confess I'm strongly disappointed in the software that comes with the program. Not Adobe, but the ScanSnap software that stands between the machine and Adobe. This software has a strangely DOS or Windows 3.1 feel to it. It won't allow you to save a file with spaces in the name, so you need to use underscores, or do what I do: Let it save it with a date-based name, then do a ""Save as"" from Adobe and change the name. Adobe will let you use a long file name with spaces. This one problem severely limits what otherwise seems like a great little machine."
4,Reversible Error,I'm reading the series in sequence and just love the detail and occasional follies of Tanenbaum's characters (Lucy and Marlene especially)
4,Well-organized as a reference for Residential Steel Framing,"As a Civil Engineer, having to deal with both horizontal and vertical construction, and having to build residential, industrial and commercial buildings, both in Hurricane zones (Dade County, Miami, Florida) and in earth movement areas (Los Angeles Force 4/Richter Scale 9) in California & now in Istanbul, Turkey, this handbook has been particularly usefull when describing Light Gauge Steel Framing to Engineers which are having to cope with the subject for the first time. Would like to know when a new Edition of this Handbook with updated data will be published?Our deep appreciation to Mr. Robert Scharff and the editors of Walls & Ceilings Magazine.Sincerely,Alexandre Byron-Exarcos President & CEO United States Steel Framing Corp."
5,Get a Grip,"This is a book for everyone who has ever thought for a moment that they were under stress. Reading this book would also help so that you can prevent stress from infringing on your mental, emotional and/or physical health. Bob Losyk has filled his book with loads of useful ideas and tools. You will benefit from his own experiences and lots of other experiences that he discusses in his book. The time taken to read this book is an investment in a more productive and happy person that you will become. You will find your work performance to be more energizing and satisfying. This book is a must read in today's fast-paced, ""get it all done no matter what"" world that we work in.Robert C. Preziosi"
2,Very Incomplete,"The book looks great and is easy for my 4th grader to read alone and process. The questions at the end of each chapter do not tell if your learner got the material so I have to write worksheets myself. Also, it has big gaps in history - such a bummer. According to this book, slavery was about the only reason for the Civil War and then the first notable event in the entire CW is the battle of Gettysburg - really!? Think we missed alot. That is just one example. I am really not happy with the content and have to supplement it with Harcourt Horizons history and workbook. I would not purchase this as your only history book."
1,Cartier,"I was delighted to read that Amazon was selling Must De cartier, but when i received the toilette spray the pump on the sprayer did not work."
2,Not as Described,"The medal is nice, but it is about half of the advertised size. It is .5"" wide by .75"" tall, NOT .75"" wide by 1"" tall as described. Also the chain is very flimsy. I ordered this for my son-in-law, and I don't have time to exchange it as he is getting ready to deploy overseas. I am going to a jewelry store to find a better chain so that the medal does not get lost. If you order this item, expect the medal to be about the size of a dime, and don't count on using the included chain."
2,not much to say,"My mother always said, ""If you don't have anything good to say, keep it to yourself."""
4,Glock is amazing,Not only does Glock supply amazing guns but amazing knifes the knife is a little smaller if your expecting a bowie knife like I was it seems sturdy and will take the abuse Iv had many knifes and i mean many and this knife has got to be my favorite although I did say this knife is amazing it amazed me when this package came tapered witch is sad :( but other then that its a quality knife also my favorite part about the knife is that it's sheath snaps into place
5,5/8-11x3 ft Grade B-7 Threaded Rod,"I needed a course thread grade B-7 threaded rod to use as a car lift on my automotive rotisserie. This product met that need, arrived quickly and was as ordered."
5,Pretty nice gun,I give this gun 5 stars because it is an extremely nice gun for the price. It is very accurate and does not often slice balls. It is also very reliable in bad weather (Including Snow). Highly recommended for beginners and recreational players.I still prefer the Tippmann A-5 and the Spyder TL-R
5,The Physician of London,"The second book of a trilogy by Stephanie Cowell. Follows Nicholas Cooke into his adult life as a minister and physician in London during the final days of King James 1 rein into the turbulent days of King Charles. The history is true and the story intrigueing. I loved it and wish she had written the third edition but cannot find it anywhere. e-mail to her on facebook has not been answered. She has written Claude and Camille, so I guess I will read that. She is a very good writer."
5,The Greatest Band You Cant Find In The Stores,"the so called professional music critics always seem to put this awesome band down,for the life of me i just cant understand why?this is a band with no equal PERIOD!!!their sound is not to be and shouldn't be compared to any other band.they were unique and are very very sorely missed.in their time we had the big bands like nirvana and metallica dominating the music scene.if Saigon kick came out now in 2010 i personally think their path would have been different.i think they would have been taken more seriously by the public.they really gave it their all to please us,the listening public.maybe we can make it up to them by requesting to the record company [ATLANTIC RECORDS]to put their records back on the shelves so the people can hear it again?all their albums were great and this one Moments From The Fringe is no exception."
3,GNR Rock the Tokyo Dome pt 2,"This is the second half of the show at the Tokyo Dome back 1992. Gilby Clarke does a formidable job in deputizing for the great Izzy Stradlin and the boys blow away the lucky Japanese who witnessed this live back in 1992. Visually the video is impressive with some wicked angles and good editing. The band's performance itself is energetic and an all out, balls to the wall assault. Alas, the audio element suffers from the same shortfalls as the UYI pt 1 dvd...ie. the balance is off or the volume fades unexpectantly. A real pity since I was hoping for some stellar audio worthy of the riveting performance. Still, Gunner fans who dont already own the VHS version, will enjoy themselves. Grade: B."
4,misunderstood book,"This is not a book for learning DirectX. Please read the title and book description before purchasing to understand what you're getting. This is a book specifically about the DX9 PROGRAMMABLE GRAPHICS PIPELINE. If you're interested in programming pixel shaders and vertex shaders and using MS's HLSL, then consider this book. It's not a C# book (nor should it be), it's a reference material for the programmable pipeline. As far as free stuff goes, well, the DirectX SDK is free, so give me a break. Everyone just has to have everything free... people should write books for you for free too? Maybe you'd like to paint my house for free? Don't tell me you're like MS too?"
2,Not for C# programmers...,Absolutely No C# or managed code. The examples are in C++ and do not compile with Visual Studio .NET 2003 due to Upper/Lower Case differences in the Header files.Due to the appalliing lack of information available on DirectX V9 managed I figured that this would provide some insight but it really deals with Assembly language HLSL and even at that all oriented for C++ with no C# examples.If you are buying this to learn HLSL specifically then this could be the book for you.If you bought it like I did hoping that it would help you with DirectX 9.0 forget it...
5,Great for Everyone!,"Top, Bottom, or switch, this book isn't wishy-washy erotica (although there are somme charming short stories for illustration within) but rather a terrific book on the emotional how-to's of S&M. The focus is on safety and consent, how to avoid hurting the person(s) you are with and how to avoid getitng hurt. If only all manuals had this much focus on the well being of the people involved!"
3,"Interesting, if a bit morally flawed","From the 20/20 of hindsight, it appears that the trials of General Homma and Yamashita were unjust ""kangaroo"" courts of military justice. I think it is an unfair reading of history. While certainly these generals did not have the same civil rights of United States citizens and were subject to questionable legal treatment, I think the outcome WAS JUST and as loyal military men, these generals knew it. They had presided over the troops responsible for one of history's greatest military crimes. While they did not directly participate in the brutal rape, murder and pillaging, it is doubtful that they were completely blind to it nor powerless to stop it. The buck stops at the top. They paid the price.How was MacArthur to dispense justice after the war? Gather up the entire Japanese Army and execute them? Symbolic execution of justice was the only rational choice for a war torn nation, trying to rebuild.History will be kind on those who uphold humanity."
1,BUYER BEWARE...DANGEROUS AND PAINFULL!!,"This is today's ""gimmick"" at it's finest!! Thought it would be a great idea for our 5 year old; however, it turned out to be a nightmare!!! First of all, we had hoped to free up our hands with this product...not possible. Either you hold the free end of the rope, or you need to find a suitable door, tree, etc. to attach it to. The advertisement doesn't show you what's at the other end of this thing. Secondly, good luck trying to turn it off...it was more like wrestling an octopus to get it shut down. Thought it was just the kid's having a difficult time until my turn came about. Try using this on individual use, but beware of the ball...IT HURTS IF IT HITS YOU!! In my opinion, this could prove to be a hazard with a spinning rope, which you cannot turn off easily, but could easily get around a child's neck. I am an adult and it was difficult for me to operate. Also cheaply made and not durable at all...Good luck with this one!!!"
1,"Do not purchase, possible injury","This was a horrible toy. I bought it for my 11 year old. We assembled it and we were afraid of it. It went very very fast to the point you couldn't get near it. There was no chance of ""jumping"" Very scary. Returned it first night we had it."
1,Don't waste your money,"Remote does a lot, but is bulky. And the annoying thing is that the remote keeps losing its programming for certain stored devices. It is easy to reprogram, but sometimes it is as often as daily. Very annoying!"
1,Item shown not stocked by merchant,"Merchant does not carry item described and shown. Instead, a previous year's model made of 2024 alloy (not 2014, current model), with a silver face plate (current model has white face), and white stars (current model has blue stars) is being sold. This is a discontinued item by the manufacture. This is a legal text book example of fraud, a bait and switch scam. Merchant was unable to produce correct item ordered."
4,Inconsistent,"I enjoyed very much the chapters about Selzer's childhood and about his physician-father. I don't think the book needed to be 300 pages long. At 200 pages, focused on his childhood, it would have been much better. The ""stuff"" he used to fill in and create a 300 page book wasn't relevant and sometimes was totally ridiculous. Did I want to read a paper he wrote in high school? I don't think so."
2,small,I expect to cook an egg in the morning.well....It is smaller than I epected.Maybe it's my fault not to check the size carefully.The product itself was good. Just please check the size before buying.
3,A LOT SMALLER than expected...,This works for a small spoon but not a spatular or anything as it is too small. Would make a good ash tray though. Still love my lodge frying pan though!
5,Excellent music for your Classical Guitar Library,Excellent for the beginner to intermediate Classical Guitarist. This book is easily a valued essential for any Guitar Library. Comes with a CD. Hope to see more from this author!
3,Greatest Comedy Ever!,"This 2nd season is probably my favorite one. My favorite episode is ""Movin Out"" and it was severely shortened. I suppose it is just a matter of business with DVDs. In several years there will probably be new edition of Alf released completely uncut because that is what they do with all the dvds out there. They have to keep something in store for the coming years. In general this is one of the best tv shows I've ever seen and I'm glad I still preserved the old uncut episodes that I ripped from TV. On average every episode on this dvd is shortened somewhat 2 to 3 minutes."
5,Awesome,"This was an awesome dvd set. Funnier than the first set, although the first set was very good. I hope the other seasons come out on dvd also."
5,Alf in the second season,"Even funnier than the 1st season. Even our 14 year old Grandson loves to watch. He had us looking for more Alf but, alas, there are only 2 seasons available that we could find. We hope that more seasons are released as these old TV programs beat the heck out of most of what is on TV these days."
1,Cut to Shreds!,These are syndicated cut to shreds versions of a classic show. Worse than the first syndicated cuts that were broadcast. Entire scenes cut where Alf sings songs that the cheapo Lions Gate may have to pay rights for. This is what keeps video pirates in business.
1,More Chopped and Edited Episodes from Lion's Gate,"Once again, I'll have to pass on the next season set of ""ALF,"" one of my fave sitcoms of all time, because Lion's Gate (and creator Paul Fusco apparently) have decided to give us more syndicated and shortened episodes in the Season Two set, repeating their huge mistake from Season One.Don't understand why any company would purposely want to exclude a huge part of their customer base by releasing an inferior product, but I'm not gonna cry for them. There are plenty of other DVD packages on the shelves, delivered with more artistic care and integrity, that I can spend my money on. Shame on Lion's Gate and Paul Fusco! :("
5,"Great, Funnier than I remember!",I remember watching Alf growing up and was so excited to see it on DVD.
2,efficient but with flaws,"The color printed is very vivid but a little off the true color. However, the prints often have streek lines at the borders that can not be fixed. The so-call ""technical supports"" which provide services over the phone (sounded like someone contracted out from India) is not very helpful in solving the problems either."
2,"5"" Long","What this listing does not tell you is that the thermometer is 5"" long, not adequate for many deep fry applications. The product packaging clearly states the size, although that's little help until it arrives. Mine's going to get sent back."
5,This book must be read by all fashion fans,"After reading this book over the weekend, I cannot recommend it enough, especially if you're interested in the fashion industry. No book I have ever read comes close to giving such thorough detail and anecdotes of what it is really like to be a top model. The parts about Milan and New York were incredible. And the way the author presents his research, facts and first hand experience himself as an undercover model make for an enjoyable and entertaining read."

3,The Fly Collection (The Fly / Return Of The Fly / The Curse Of The Fly),"While on the surface, the collection of films are very good, the technical aspects are in question. 20th Centruy Fox did an incomplete job when they constructed the technical configuration for DVD play. These Discs will not perform well on all DVD players, yet Fox did nothing to inform the buying public of their decisions. So , let the buyer beware, these DVD's may not play well on your player."
3,"Good music, with some irritating spoken word samples","I am a big fan of Beta Band, and I like music that has a variety of things going on. Another one that I like with samples is Moby from the late 90s. I heard a few of Tunng's songs on an internet music site, and liked them well enough to buy the album. That said, after I had given it a listen a couple of times, the samples became a focus of the music and actually detracted from it rather than added to it. It's a small thing, but it makes the album unlistenable for me. If I could take those things off it, I might be able to listen to it."
3,not what i thought,"it was an ok book. i though it would tell me how to start up as a DJ, but it just told me things about if i had already been a DJ and wanted to build it into a full on business. if your looking for something to tell you how to improve your work and do bigger and better things with something you have ALREADY started... then buy the book."
3,Pretty Good,"I purchased this book with two others on this subject and I found this book to be the most useful. I found it to be well rounded with information. It has sections on Mobile DJ Service, Club DJ Service, Equipment, Marketing and Advertising, Music, Fees, and much more. Eash section had the right amount of information. It still left me with questions but I thought it was a good start."
4,Religious Studies,The book came suggested by Amazon.com while I was searching another title and I am glad it did! This was an excellent recommendation. The book is organized by a serious of questions and serves as an benefical reference while reading other books on Catholicm or by itself. I am pleased to have purchased the item.
5,I love it.,I already had a Catechism of the Catholic Church but in my class someone mentioned this book. I am so glad I bought it. It is so much easier to understand. It is the same teaching. Just in a easier format.
2,Early Alex Britti,"This CD's original release date is listed as 2004. However, the date on the back of the actual CD packaging is 1992. It sounds like some older tracks Britti did before the hits started. Real disappointing to listen to. Voice doesn't sound good and the music is boring. Nowheres near his ""3"" CD which is fantastic. I hope Amazon corrects the issue date information so others don't buy this thinking it is from 2004. If you want to hear Britti at his best buy ""3""."
4,Speaking Cajun,I would give this five stars if I had the book with it. Practice makes perfect and I my relatives are impressed with how this method is so true to Cajun accent!
3,Pleasant but old,"The quality of this CD is good but the singing is very old fashioned as compared to how they sing today. The voices are all good however, and natuarally you couldnt ask for anything better as it was written by Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart."
4,The 'Hacker - Reves Mecaniques,"The Hacker's REVES MECANIQUES starts out with the quiet throb of ""Flesh & Bone,"" which quickly turns darker, alternating between spiderwebs and the spider's venom. There's a subtlety to The Hacker's creations, and even Miss Kittin's vocals on ""Masterplan"" or Mount Sims on ""Traces"" don't interfere with the smoothness. But he's adept at many different moods, bringing a growling menace to ""Village of the Damned"" and ""Radiation"" and a delicacy to ""Electronic Snowflakes."" (""It's the Mind"" manages to combine both together!) ""The Brutalist"" dips into some acid, and ""Sleeping Machines"" ends the album on a science-fiction-y note. Quite nice."
2,Good Songs; MP3s Skip :-(,"The selections on this collection are decent, but many of the MP3 files -- particularly the second half of the first disk -- contain skips.It would also be helpful if the individual artists were listed; every file has ""Various Artists - Avid Entertainment"" in the ID3 tag."
3,Learn About MTV Dances,"If you would like to learn dances done on MTVs, then this is the dvd for you. Tina Landon breaks down each segment of the dance/video she whishes you to master. The teaching pace is just right and if you do not get it the first time,rewind.The instructions are not done as mirror image so you have to do it on the opposite direction.The last dance segment of the dvd is interestin, imo. I hope next time, Ms. Landon will do different dance routines instead of the ones she all ready did in her previous works. If not, maybe she could add a couple of Janet Jackson moves,which i find better than the other teeny booper singer/dance video she did.I find the interviews and other interuptions pretty annoying. I payed for the dance instructions not the interview.I hope the next session will have emphasis on the instructions."
4,Excellent for Student Pilots,"The most important element of this book is that it is an easy read, so its messages come though easily. (Always do a complete pre-flight, practice your slow-flight techniques, never get away from the basics, etc.) It has many real-life examples, some humorous, some not, and is not filled with dry, technical elements. This is it's weak spot as well. There is no in-depth discussions, so I suspect most non-student pilots will not find this book worth their time. Students, however, will find value because it hammers inthe basics of safe flight and what happens when you ignore the basics.I gave the book four stars because it delivers exactly what it says: a discussion on the basics of safe flight, but it doesn't have much else."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I ordered this because I didn't have ""In Paradise"" on CD. I was disappointed with some of the other tunes on the disc, but still, the only CD with ""Paradise"" so I'm OK with that. Vendor was very prompt, condition of CD was better than expected (almost mint) and very timely arrival."
4,Pleasing party pumps!,"Fun and fashionable!! This project was a bit messy - the 'gemstones' ended up all over the kitchen. But, my child was so proud of the finished project that I can only rave about it...(and pray she doesn't outgrow them too soon!) lol"
5,Nice Mix,"Years later, and I still really like this CD. Bruce Hornsby is great, and the last song with an unreleased Garcia tune is phenomenal!(SP?) The Ziggy Marley tunes are a nice contrast to The Other Ones/Dead. Either case worth the investment."
1,Not map of Loire valley!,"I ordered this map as we were driving from Paris to the chateaux of the Loire valley two weeks ago. This is the only choice that comes up when you search for Loire valley Michelin road maps on amazon. Unfortunately, none of the area surrounding the towns of amboise and tours, where all the castles are located, is included on this map! I unfortunately did not discover this until my family and I were on the road in our rental car . So it is completely unused."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading reviews of various Latin curricula for 4th grade, I chose Matin Latin. Unfortunately, it is not a stand alone text. The lessons are not well explained and the worksheets are either too simple or too complex. For example, the first lesson is on nouns and it asks the students to underline the noun in a short english sentence. That was great, but it needed a followup with more complex sentences. The second lesson identifies the five cases in latin. However, it doesn't give any background on what these cases represent or discuss their parallels in english grammar. The student worksheet asks students to write out the cases for several latin words without a good description of how to do it. If you know latin and want to supplement other materials with items from this book, it would probably work. However, if you want to teach your child (or yourself) latin, save your money and buy a copy of Wheelocks."
3,"cut off wheel, supposed to be 20, I got one","There is the ""(Pack of 20)"" advertised in the head line of this item, but I received a quantity of ONE cut off wheel. I assume there is a mistake in the header. Perhaps they should fix this."
2,This unit does not last!,"I bought the similar FP209501 a couple of years ago and have no more than about 12 hours total on it, and already the unit will not pressurize. I contacted Campbell and they told me there is a teflon ring that breaks down and gets a flat spot, and that if you don't remember to routinely run it (without pressure), the unit will break down like this even with minimal use. Also, if you do everything just right, it will only last about 3 years (even without much use). I had an older pancake unit that did the same thing, but for an occasional user like me, $80-100 is too much for this poor quality. I told them to take the 'built to last' propaganda off the unit. I believe it's a case of planned obsolescence, because certainly they could improve this teflon ring for a few extra dollars!"
1,waist of money,"This compressor is good for included stapler(which is also low quality) and to add air to your tires. Manometer scale is up to 260 psi, but it does not build pressure more than 80 psi. No power just noise."
1,Incredibly LOUD!,Bought this at Lowes because I was in a hurry for it. It is so incredibly loud you can feel your ears being damaged. Had to go outside while it charged up. Will return it and buy the Makita Mac 700.
1,Dead on Arrival,This unit worked exactly 2 seconds before going dead. Good luck talking to a CSR at Campbell Hausfeld. I took 2 days and 4 emails for them to confirm that the unit I received was faulty and needed to be returned.
1,Nothing for me,"When I was taking this product, I noticed absolutely, 100% NOTHING. People say this is better than caffeine? Interesting. Clearly the product works for a lot of people, so, you'll just have to find out for yourself I think. But as far as my experience went, it did nothing. I took it on an empty stomach. I took it by itself. I took it in the morning, at night, one capsule, two capsules etc. So, believe you me, I gave it a fair shake!On the other hand, I do like NOW products and I DO recommend them."
4,my libido is back!,"I take meds for anxiety and depression. That pretty much depletes any sex drive and guarantees weight gain. I have more energy, better mood, libido is way up and a bit of a curbed appetite since taking l-tyrosine 500mg a day for a month. Go for it!"
4,L-Tyrosine for Depression - Energy,"I wasn't sure at first, but after using this for a couple of weeks one day I forgot to take it and I noticed a big difference in my energy levels. It has helped boost my mood, as I am not crying as much and I'm hoping after a few more weeks it will really kick in. Others have noticed me feeling better & said they want what I have. I've tried anti-depressants and they are just too mind altering for me. With this you don't feel the side effects like with prescriptions. I say for the $$$ so far a great product."
2,Not impressed,"Given by two Australians in a room with bad acustics and a cheesy sign as a backdrop. The material is OK, but better, more through lessions can be found for free on line. Don't waste your money."
4,a bit of punk nostagia,"This disc reminds me of how much fun was 70s and 80s punk music, bands like Graham Parker and The Rumour, UK Squeeze and Elvis Costello. A fantastic collection of nostalgia, sure got me singing along in the car."
2,Slow,"The book was in a good condition. However, although I ordered 2-day shipping, the book arrived like 2-3 weeks later."
3,Blueprint For Murder / Man In the Attic,"I enjoyed both movies, but then I love to look at classic movies. I would recommend it to people that do not like to view harsh crimes."
3,"Not so ""Mighty"".","Don't get me wrong, I love the Bosstones, but all we really get here is one of the always lame ""Millennium"" collections. Of course there is no official ""Best Of"" yet, so this may have to do for some. There's great stuff here however, like ""Someday I Suppose"", ""Kinder Words"", a cover of ""Detroit Rock City"", and their biggest hit ""Impression That I Get"". Where this fails most, is that it's only 12 tracks, and it's lacking ""Where'd You Go?"", which is one of their best songs ever. Again, good songs here, just too little. I'd suggest the 22 track ""Live From The Middle East"" instead. It's basically a live best of."
5,I Died Laughing,"This is a choice little book about taking charge of your owndeath, or having your family do so, not having a funeral homecharge whopping fees and put your family in the poor house.It is full of great cartoons, humor, and the truth about homeburials as a practical way of ending one's life."
4,Helpful,"The purpose of this book is to help you identify your uniqueness and build upon your discovery. He writes, ""... you are the customized expression of a loving God."" He describes the process of success as being ongoing and discusses how to maintain the momemtum. Discovering one's area of giftedness and building on that in a way that glorifies God is the essence of the book.He devotes more discussion on specific ways of discovering one's giftedness and how to apply that knowledge to everyday life. The weakness of the book is the extreme to which he takes his argument. He sees dramatic shifts occurring in society to accomodate people's giftings. His proposals are far from practical. Sometimes one simply has to work outside one's giftedness tempoarily, e.g., when one is in college.The first part of the book is the strongest. His insight is helpful in getting a better handle on how to live in a targeted, fulfilling manner."
4,Inspirational!,Follow your dreams and make a living while you do it. Marsha Sinetar writes an inspirational book with some advice on how to make the pursuit of your dreams a reality.
3,Good For Starting,"This is a good book when you're trying to get the inspiration or courage to change. It's very spiritual and ""pick me up"" which is something everyone needs before they take action.That said, this book won't really help you in developing a plan of action towards that goal. If you want that, try Barbara Sheror Zig Ziglar or Tony Robbins."
5,THe league of Gentlemen,About the funniest and most deranged series around. Incredible writing and dark humor with plent of cross dressing what more could you want
5,AAA+++,"This is literally the funniest and most addictive TV show I've ever seen. There, I've said it."
2,Not good,"The Hole is not a good movie, and Joe Dante is simply not a good director. He got lucky with The Howling (because of a good John Sayles script), and has done little of value since. The Hole is extremely derivative of 80's horror films like The Gate and Dreamscape, with a little of Dante's own phenomenally overrated Gremlins thrown in for good measure. It is utterly unoriginal in both story and execution. Movies do not have to be original insofar as plot - the very concept of ""genre"" underscores this fact. But formulaic or derivative movies are especially beholden to execute their predictable plots and two-dimensional characters with some kind of flourish, and The Hole fails on this account. Been there, done that, and the fact that we been there done that 25 years ago, and more than once, only makes matters worse."
3,WATCH OUT FOR THAT HOLE,"THE HOLE is one of those ""kid-friendly"" horror films that's light on gore and other R-rated entrapments. Helmed by Joe Dante (GREMLINS), the story focuses on two brothers who discover a strange ominous hole in the basement of their new house. We soon learn there are nasty beings dwelling in the hole...can't tell you more to avoid spoilers.The movie looks like it was a 3-D flick, but my copy isn't officially 3-D.The acting is average, with Chris Massoglia and Nathan Gamble as the brothers, Hayley Bennett, cute neighbor....Bruce Dern is the town looney and Teri Polo once again plays the harried single mom.THE HOLE would make a good rental for a kids Halloween party but adults may find it a little lame."
1,Deceptive,"My son *really* wanted a marble run for his birthday. I bought this based on a model we played with at a local toy store, which contained real marbles. The description on amazon says ""real marbles."" The book, pictures, and box all show real marbles. This toy showed up with *plastic pellets* instead of a single real marble. Thanks, amazon, for selling me a product under false pretenses. Not only does my son NOT have a MARBLE run for his birthday, but I'll have to track down a huge bag of many extraneous marbles somewhere and buy them separately.Btw, this toy comes with no set up instructions other than the picture, and is very flimsy. I ought to return it on sheer principle of there being no real marbles in it, but my son would be sad."
2,Not Compatible with other marble run,As this product is not inexpensive I was really disappointed that this is not compatible with other Quercetti sets. I bought as my husband and daughter like to build together and were hoping to expand our existing set. This set is stand alone and does not have the same connections.
4,Great fun marble run,My 4 year old loves playing with this. Usually he'll play with toys for a few days then move on but this one has been a favorite for over almost two months. It's also nice that he and his friends can play at the same time. The only issue of course is that the marbles end up all over the house. And check pockets very carefully before laundering - I've found a few marbles in the washing machine despite what I thought was a careful inspection of pockets.
2,"Flimsy, doesn't work","I am not very impressed by this marble run. For one, it's not very sturdy, and two, the marbles fly off the track in several places and get stuck in others. I would recommend you look elsewhere for a marble run, just my opinion."
4,Not a Bad Little Western...?,"A look at the Spanish/American War at the turn of the 20th Century in which President William McKinley was assassinated over and future president Theodore Roosevelt was a hero of.This is more of a war movie than a cavalry western but a fascinating tour through an all-but-forgotten period of time where America adopted its stance on globalization of the American Way.I injoyed this flick, even though it suffers from a plague of stereotypes.Alpha Video released a fairly clear and stable copy."
4,The 13th Day,"This was a good rendition of the apparitions to the children of Our Lady of Fatima. Although all facts were not filmed, this movie certainly whets the appetite to read all about the events as they happened in Fatima, Portugal. After reading about the events, I wish there was more in the movie about the Angel sent to the children and more about the parish priests and the political climate at the time, but still a visually stunning movie. I suggest to everyone to find the book written by Sister Lucia and read her accounts as well as view this movie. Miracles do happen! A beautiful movie."
4,Fatima,"A great movie,showing us what happened in the portuguese village of Fatima in 1917.I think the actors did a good job and made this film enjoyable for everyone,including non-believers.I just don't understand why this movie hasn't been released in europe yet."
1,Horrible,"If I could give this toaster a zero, I would. It either burns everything or takes forever to toast before burning it. Our waffles this morning, burnt ON ONE SIDE and WET on the other. Don't waste your $$!"
3,Did the job,"When I first purchased this toaster, there were mixed reviews. I took a chance. Did a great job with toast and english muffins. Didn't have to adjust the settings for those kind of breads. The downfall was the bagel setting. Although the slots are slightly bigger then most models, the bagel would still get burned on the outside (even when set to 1 or 2). I didn't pay much for it so I didn't expect it to last, but it did until I upgraded to a toaster oven. I still have it and use it at work now.Overall - it was a good toaster. However, if you are bagel lover - stick to a toaster oven."
3,It works OK,"I've owned this toaster for about a year and have seen the 1 star reviews but mine has worked without a problem. However, I've noticed that with extra long slices of bread the ends get more toasted than the middle. This seems to be an issue with most if not all of the long slot toasters. Why some engineer can't arrange the coils to prevent this I'm not sure but the unevenness is not severe enough that I want to get rid of this one."
1,Waste of money -- 0 stars,"Half the bread is charred, the other half not even toasted. Even if you interrupt the toasting halfway through and reposition the bread you STILL can't get an even toast.The designers also put form over function. The wide bottom may look retro cool but I'd rather have the counter space."
1,One word: AWFUL,"We've owned this toaster for 12 months and that's 12 months too long. Despite it's nice looks and numerous settings it toasts one of two ways: burned or underdone. When underdone, it takes takes two or three toasting cycles and constant monitoring to simply brown the bread. Even then the toasting is uneven. I can't believe Oster would release such piece of you-know-what."
1,Going in the garbage can tonight,"After a year of very light use, it stopped working. We could not get the toast to stay down. When it finally did, it would not come back up. It is broken, and I am putting it out in the trash can tonight."
1,I hate it!!!,I had a small GE with all the same features the only problem was toasting large slices. I found this toaster and the price all though a little high was not unreasonable compared to others with similar options.This toaster burns everything no matter what setting you put it on. My bagels and English Muffins come out half cooked but burned on the outer layer and I always have to hit the cancel button. If you must use it move it out from under your cabinets!!! The other bad thing is it will eat your Pop Tarts.
2,Find another toaster,This toaster looks nice but that's about it. I haven't had heating issues like other people but my bread or Pop Tarts always get stuck in this toaster and then I have to unplug it and fish around with tongs until I can get my breakfast out.
2,It was okay for a while....,"I bought it for the looks. I love the design. But this week was the last straw! Lately (for the past year or so) we've had a ton of trouble with it burning some slices, toasting unevenly, etc. Then a couple of days ago the button stuck and it just kept right on cooking...and just about burned our kitchen down. Definitely do not buy. I'm looking at the reviews and buying something a little more high-end that hopefully will last."
1,piece of crap,"A toaster is not a complex piece of machinery. Thus, I was rather annoyed that this toaster died after about two years. Like another reviewer, mine just decided to quit releasing the toast, leading to a very burn piece of bread."
4,best photo paper,using HP paper w/ HP printer is a given. I have tried other paper products but always come back to this. Colors are crisp and the photos seem to dry faster.
5,Nail protein,"My nails are very brittle and tend to layer. I have tried several different products, but, by far, this is the best. There are three different formulas of Nailtiques protein and formula 2 was the one I used. Within a few weeks I could see a major difference with my nails. They began to grow and quit splitting. I have been using the protein for about a year and people always comment about how nice my nails look. I highly recommend this product and will continue to buy it; it is well worth any amount of money."
1,Building the church of Christ or building a denomination?,"The author says the present generation church can be like the first generation church, but how can that be? The first church had 'the same' gospel, there was only 'one denomination' at that time and they were simply called Christians. There was no need for denominations in the early church because disciples all believed 'exactly the same things'. To say the present church can be like the first is to not understand the first.The teachings in this book merely show how to run a successful corporation for that is was this present generation of many churches has become."
2,meh...,"I bought this album on the strength of ""Polar Opposites."" Not a bad tune. As a matter of fact, a great tune. But if you're going to jam, and make me pay [money] to hear it, you better be able to say something. And that's the problem with this band. They don't say anything. They have all the right influences. The CD cover looks great. But it doesn't deliver the goods. In which case, what's the point?"
1,STOP!,"I applaud bands who try to nonconform and be unique.. But this is just horrible.. While I am not an avid modest mouse fan, I do enjoy some of their stuff.. But this CD is just track after track of mindless, similar beats.. Which inturn makes them one of the conformists. BAH!"
5,Wow - how did I miss this way back when,"Last year a friend of mine told me to check out some Modest Mouse. I got one of their newer albums, and it really didn't connect much with me.A couple of weeks ago I heard Cowboy Dan on the radio, and looked it up. I was shocked to find out it was Modest Mouse - sounded so fresh and new, but actually is their older work. I wish I could go back 13 years and tell myself to pick up this album. But better late than never.My favorite tracks include:7. Cowboy Dan8. Trailer Trash14. Bankrupt on Selling15. Styrofoam Boots/It's All Nice on Ice, AlrightThe other stuff is good too, but those are the top four on the album."
4,Unusually good songwriting from start to finish.,"The last time I saw these guys live they were too drunk to do their music justice, but in the studio they continue to turnout albums full of raw, deeply textured rock with lyrics unusually grounded in disappointed realism for a band this young. This album one of the best I've come across in the last year. So much tallent."
3,Helpful,A little goes a long way. Measuring cap broke after first use. Seems to help with mite problem. Leaves laundry feeling dry. Feel like sometimes irritates skin.
1,Awful,"You get what you pay for! I knew $40 was too little to pay for 6 cages. Very cheap quality. Not even sure I'll use these things. I've seen these on Amazon for $150 otherwise. Please don't pay that much for these cheap cages. They're barely worth the little less than $10 each I paid for them. Your birds will not be safe. Also, there is no breeder door so you have to use inside mounting nest boxes. I bought 3 set of these because I really had high hopes. Only one set came complete with the six cages. Amazon charged me the two other sets but only sent one cage in each box for the other two orders. They tried to pull a fast one. Had to send the two cages back and get my money back. Overall epic fail."
3,"An ""okay"" underwater thriller","As a fan of Clancy and Cussler, I was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, it comes up short. There is a decent amount of technical information, but how exciting is an underwater sled with a camera attached to it? (not nearly as exciting as a torpedo bearing down on a captain desperately trying to make evasive maneuvers!) As for the action, it's okay. The ending is quite good, although the ""secret"" didn't live up to my expectations. A decent book, but you won't stay up until 3:00am reading this one."
3,The power of evil unleashed against the forces of good,CAIN is a thrill ride of a book from page 1 till the end. I enjoyed the characters of Solomon and Father Marcelle. Satan as an invulnerable demonic super soldier is such a great idea that I could see why Bruce Willis bought the rights to this book. CAIN is a long read but a good read as well. I would recommend this to horror as well as sci-fi fans. The underlying theme was the power of faith and how it will overcome all. Of course there is great sacrifice involved but what a great story.
4,Great!,"This is one of the first albums Aymuth came in, and they came in great! Originally titled Aguia Nao Come Mosca. This supertrio made from this album a party, great bass work by Alex Malheiros (track; Falcon love call-Armazen no.2) Track 2, the title track, Aguia Nao Come Mosca is subtile with the tremendous Jose Robert Bertrami at his top. The album is released in 1977. A real must for Brasil-Fusion-Jazz lovers."
4,Mixed Feelings,"At times, I found this book lacked freshness--it said what so many others had said before. At others, I was drawn in and found Seidman's suggestions exciting and interesting. My favorite chapters were 7--an outline of the hero's journey--and 4--an overview of fiction genres. If you don't mind wading through the old-had advice, you will find your self rewarded with plenty of fresh and savory guidelines and tips. This book is most appropriate for the beginner or novice writer."
3,Cardinal Garland,"This item was okay but not the quality I expected for the price of the item, would not purchase again."
2,Basic,"This is very very basic. I can see how it might help high school students, but if you know literature terms at all ... say symbolism or metaphor then a quick read through is all one will need. I am glad I only paid I think $1.99 on my Kindle for it."
1,Boring,"I guess you can read it to better yourself in reading. Lol! But it had a couple of good points, I only read it for class. && it was extremley boring"
4,Very engaging!,"This book by the literature professor Thomas C. Foster really helped me, as a senior in high school, really understand the types of symbols that I would find in fiction novels. He explained why they represent what they represent, but also explained that there could be more than one thing that they represent. It was engaging, it wa like I was right there sitting in his classroom, and it had a comical sense to it as well, making it easier to get through. There were a lot of examples, which was a little annoying seeing as I hadn't read most of the books he set examples to, but I'm sure he put them there for a reason, helping other people since I'm not the only person in the world. I recommend this book to anyone who is a high school or coege student in need of help of reading literature like their teachers/professors do. It was very helpful!"
5,"Interesting, Enlightening, and Accessible","I loved this book for many reasons, but mostly because it's so accessible. The author presents his ideas as if he were having a casual conversation with you. There's no snobbery, no looking down his nose at you... basically, nothing like what I would normally expect when I think of someone who is capable of reading literature with such extreme depth and who understands the allusions. Reading the book is like having a conversation about your favorite books with a good friend, or with a really cool teacher - which Foster apparently is. I would have loved to have sat in on one of his classes when I was in college. I'm looking forward to reading his other book about how to read novels like a profession, and I hope he continues to write."
2,Disappointing flavor and cumbersome to use,"Each tab is individually packed, but each tab is relatively large. Far larger than most water bottles. The tab took well over 10 minutes to dissolve completely. Taste was poor in comparision to some other low sugar high carb drinks."
1,Dang Jerry posted too late,I already bought this DVD. He is right in all aspects. They are charging a Criterion price for a cheap VHS to DVD transfer. Things like this should be illegal. A clear rip off.Whodany
4,Nature's Herbs Forskohlii,"I have found that since taking this supplement, my appetite is more controlled and I feel less 'hungry' during non-active times than before I was taking it. At this time of year, my activity level decreases and I tend to crave carbohydrates and eat more in general. Since taking this supplement, once in the morning and once at night, my cravings have decreased and I feel more full and less likely to snack during the day. I am combining it with the 7-Keto and hoping that it will prevent my annual 10-pound weight-gain over the winter."
4,Excellent Training Guide,High Tech Product Launch is a great training guide for new product launch managers. The step-by-step layout of the launch process was extremely helpful in preparing me to launch new products successfully in a very dynamic environment. It also provides wonderful tips on organization and planning for marketing project managers.
2,Get Hot,"I've had this gismo for about 1 week. I noticed after my 45 min dirve to work, that it got very hot. I called customer support and they said it was normal for the unit to get hot. Anyway a few days later, the fues blew. I replaced it, and after about 10 min it blew again.Besides the above issue, VRFM8W works great as described. I think the sound quality is good."
2,Uh not that great!,I was disappointed the remote and controls only works for usb drive players. Also the reviews ab it having static are correct. I tried it out this morning and I think I was able to get it on a frequency that didn't have static so I think it will work for my commute car. I might get the usb drive player as opposed to plugging in my mp3 player. So I suppose if there is no other alternative this could possibly work for you but I was disappointed.
1,"Great headphones, when they are not falling apart","At first, these headphones are fantastic - comfortable, great sound quality, and great noise cancellation. I often fly in turboprops which are very noisy airplanes, and I can hear my music in full fidelity. I also like the nice case with all the extra adapters. But as others say, the headphones literally start crumbling apart after a while. My headphones still work, but are taped together with electrical tape. It won't be long before I have to replace them and it definitely won't be another Jabra."
4,First Set of Noise Cancelling Headphones - I'm in love,"I am a music fan. Not an pro or anything, not one of those people who can hear a dog whistle or a ultra-low frequency sounds, but I definitely like a nice set of headphones. I've tried many over the years and always wanted more. The sound out of these headphones when the noise cancelling is on is fantastic.Pros: noise cancelling that workscomfortablesimple and easycarrying case and all kinds of adapters/connectorssingle AAA battery poweredreasonably long battery lifeCons: not the greatest sound when not using noise cancelingBut hey - I bought these for their noise canceling feature so if they aren't canceling noise then why am I using them? Oh by the way, I can hardly hear myself typing this because of the noise canceling :)"
2,Very poorly made,"I've owned these for over a year now, and while the sound quality is okay (you get a bit of white noise when they're on) that doesn't make up for the poor construction quality.The plastic housing that connects the earpiece to the adjustment slider cracked on one side after only three months. Then it cracked on the other. Finally, both broke completely and they headphones wouldn't stay on anymore.Frankly this is easily resolved with superglue, but the design is very poor and the plastic is thin and cracks easily. You're better off looking for alternatives."
2,Decent but not what I expected,"I bought two of these expecting the long lasting, strong, stiff type. I knew they were beads but these things are barely stress balls. They can pass for them but i doubt if there will be any hand strengthing going on or whether they will work for real stress relief. They are rather soft, the beads arent pack in tight at all and they feel more like a beanie baby than a stress balls. I returned mine but I still give it 2 stars because they may work for others. More like boredom or pass the time balls but not stress balls."
3,Ok,"I read the first three books before I read this one, so I understood everything that was going on. Towards the end though, the book got really confusing. This book also wasn't as good as the first three because I think there was a lot of unnecessary things added to the story that made it somewhat boring at times. But overall the book was ok."
4,"Gets boring in the middle, should have more action.","I think it was ok, but I wish it had more action and it got boring in the middle of the book. Over all it was ok."
5,Love Found,"Leann Harris has written a very good book, it has suspense, rescue, romance and the evil family that is trying to ruin it all.Matthew ""Hawk"" Hawkins has to protect his old flame, Renee Girouard, who is pregnant with his child, from someone who is trying to kill her. Renee has just found out her boss is really her father and his heir, which sets her up as very unpopular with his family.This is a book where everyone is suspect, but hard to determine the guilty party. I enjoyied it very much and think it is a good addition to your library.Hope Ms. Harris will write a book about Hawk's friend and ex-partner Tony ""Ash"" Ashcroft."
1,Scratching the chalkboard is better than this single..,"If you wanna hear overdone vocals and a stale beat, this is the CD for you. Frankly, Double You is just a cover band with no real talent whatsoever. Just listen to their last few cover tunes and you get the idea. In short, this CD is NOT worth buying. Thankfully, CD compilations like Ministry of Sound's The Annual 2004 and Trance Arena 4 return me back to musical bliss."
1,Don't waste your money.,This book doesn't live up to it's name at all. It contains no useful information on soldering or wiring. All the information contained in this book can be found in much greater detail and for free on the internet. So don't waste your money on this book. This book is supposed to be a beginners guide and a lot of the terms used are not described at all. So someone having no idea about electronics and wiring would be completely lost. I'm not even going to try to sell my copy I'm throwing it out so no one else has the misfortune of spending their money on such a useless book.
4,Interested in Radio? You Need This,"I had a slight interest in radio before enrolling in a class at the University of Southern California. One day, I went to the bookstore to get my course books early and picked this one up. It's a true eye-opener and such a good reference text. If you have any desire to learn about radio in any facet at all, pick this one up - you won't regret it."
2,Moldy,"I purchased a box of 6 of these November 2011. They are really big and I noticed they were slightly moist in the middles. The dogs liked them - however they had terrible gas from them. By the time I opened the last bag in February 2012,I noted that they were covered in a white mold - absolutely f urry or otherwise I might not have noticed it. I wondered whether some of the previous bags might have contained slight mold that I did not notice. I contacted the vendor using the 'contact us' on their website, but no reply. I won't take a chance on them again."
3,"Dogs love them, but they don't last long","I was hoping these would have more of the same staying power as a rawhide chew does, but my dogs (a golden retriever and a 50 lb mix) each devoured their piece in about 3 minutes.So, while the dogs love them, I probably won't buy them again because they were kind of expensive and aren't going to last that long."
5,Great for so many reasons,"My dog has a health issue relating to digestion, so I make his food etc. and am very careful with what I give him. One of the acceptable things (which is in his normal meals) is sweet potatoes, so I thought I'd give these a try as I am pretty limited with chew toys. Was afraid he wouldn't like them as much because he already gets cooked sweet potatoes but he really does love them. The big size is great, yes they aren't going to last a long time, but it makes him very happy. I would highly recommend to people whose dogs have allergy issues. For the people that said it gave their dogs diarrhea or gas, yes, sweet potatoes have a LOT of fiber in them. I am careful not to overdo it but if a dog's system isn't used to it then I can see why that might happen. Anyways, great product."
1,Dolly What Has Happened????,"I used to like dolly alot, and as a personality I still do..but man she had sure not produced any good cds in years."
1,Form over Substance,"While Parton is incapable of recording a truly bad album (well, there was 1987's RAINBOW), this is a major letdown after the understated elegance of her recent folk/bluegrass work. The production is as over-the-top glitzy as her outfit on the cover, and the song selection is baffling. Rather than including the war-mongering ""Ballad of the Green Beret"", she would have been better off with Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land"" and ""Pastures of Plenty"", which would have been equally patriotic, but would also have been more in keeping with her last three albums. Instead, what she ended up with was an album that sounds like it's designed as a soundtrack for the next Republican convention."
3,Not Ed's best,"I am a drummer/percussionist who plays Brazilian instruments and music and gives related workshops on occasion. I loved Ed's Afro-Cuban Percussion for Drum Set, which is a good resource, but this one, not so much. The genre examples are at times outdated, very limited or just odd. The Weiner/Fonseca Brazilian Rhythms for Drum Set is more useful, as is The Feeling of Samba for Drummers by Magno Bissoli Siqueira, if you can find it (though more limited in scope)."
3,Great conversation piece but very uncomfortable and not durable,"these slippers look so cute! They are, however, not very comfortable. There is a defect in the pair I bought and something very very hard pokes into the top of the foot in that slipper. They also look like they will fall apart pretty fast. As an ""occasional"" slipper, they are fine. Each slipper looks different, one of the rabbits has his mouth wide open and ears back, the other keeps his mouth shut and ears up. I don't think this was intentional, but it sure is hilarious."
4,Vampire Bunny Slippers!,"These are by far the funniest slippers I have ever owned. Sadly though for those guys out there who love them, beware, they might be too small for you. My kids and I can wear them without issue, but my husband (size 10M shoes) can't get them on his feet. Otherwise if you like Monty Python or vampires and have a sense of humor, these are for you."
1,"You're Mother Was a Hamster, and Your Father Smelt of Elder Berries","Seriously? forty dollar slippers for a thousand??Think geek sold these for that price and your insane if you think people will pay that sum for bunnie slippers,no matter WHO they reference in what movie genre.time to correct your postings... or I'll count to three and use the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.. FIVE!!!oops that's right out.. THREE!!!Seeya,Me"
2,"CD-2 is 4*s; CD-1 was not sent, so =0. Avge is 4/2=2*s/CD.","This is a 2 CD album. Vol 2 is a splendid performance of the second halfof the program. Fine selections, witty, sympathetic singing, great solos,great orchestra performance and support.There is no Vol 1.The album's price is obviously inconsistent with it having two CD.s. And a re-order also brought me only Vol 2. So I take their word for it.If they ever decide to include both CD's, I'll be happy to change myrating to a full album rating."
3,Great info,"But I must say... a little boring. This video uses an extremely familiar piece to introduce standard orchestral instruments, but it is very dated (i.e. trendy, for the 80s) and the presentation style intellectual. A good study tool, not easy to enjoy."
2,Worst of all the brain games,"We own the Big Brain Academy, the Brain Age and this one. Big Brain Ac. is far the best one. For Kids and Adults, as it has different difficulties. You cannot put it away! The Brain Age is ok but my son (7) doesn't like it. I like it for the Sudoku. Gamma Wave is not a hit. At the beginning is a story, you dont need and then you just turn it off again because it is boring. Dont waste your money on that one!"
3,Try Big Brain Academy and Brain Age first.,"If you have already played out Brain Age and Big Brain Academy, you might find this is a pleasant little diversion to play with. The story might as well not be there, I've never bothered with it, because I don't need some silly story to work on my memory.I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this, but at that rate, it was worth it to have an extra diversion when I have to sit around and wait for something."
2,Get Big Brain Academy or Brain Age instead,"Don't waste your money. The Brain Age and Big Brain Academy are SO much better and so much more fun. The countdown between ""problems"" in the games gets old really fast. The pictures all have the same color palette, so sometimes it's incredibly difficult to differentiate between them, which I suppose might be helpful for memory recall, but the way they are laid out in this game just makes them annoying and frustrating. To me, the story is actually the best thing about the game, but you have to play the stupid games in order for it to advance, and the characters' reactions when you don't complete the game are patronizing and irritating. But at least the story breaks up the motonoty of the games themselves. I absolutely would not recommend this game, especially since Brain Age and Big Brain Academy are so far superior!"
2,"Covers the basics, but disorganized","Bushong covers the necessary information, but I find the organization and emphasis used in this edition to be severely lacking. All that said, there is a newer edition out that perhaps has corrected these flaws."
3,Works OK,"The temperture and time work very well and easy to set up. The ""forcasting"" is pretty tough to adjust correctly and mine still isn't right. Would have been better just to read out the barometric pressure and the trend. Also dissapointed the 24 hour maximum and minimum has to be reset every day."
2,failed just after warranty,"I was generally happy with the product, although I did have to change the selectable transmission channel on occasion to eliminate static in the sound. This was not a big problem, but just after the warranty expired, the sender unit would no longer change frequency channels. It is locked on one of the four transmission channels and while the unit functions on that channel, I can no longer change to eliminate static."
1,Cut This One,"I purchased this book as a result of reading the on-line reviews on this website....never again! This book was one of the worst I have ever read. Not the least bit scary and it was highly predictable. The author has no clue how to construct dialogue nor develop interesting characters. In his book he has the local press referring to the killer as ""The Farmer"" after he has only killed twice. In reality, he would not even be construed as a serial killer. This author also must have a thing for red hair as he refers to various characters by the description throughout this pathetic attempt at suspense. Only an idiot could not have seen the end coming!!! By then I was hoping they would all get killed they were so boring. The woman he married was a poorly developed character for a police woman. She should be booted off the force for sheer incompetence and stupidity. No suspense but senseless gore with no pay off. I sincerely hope this man keeps his day job"
1,stolen ideas done poorly,"The author may teach writing, but does not fashion any plot that holds the readers' attention. Stock characters and rehased plot."
4,Cute little book!,I got this for my daughter who is a first-time mother. She thought it was very funny and appropriate. The photos in it are very nicely done. The book is kind of short. I was hoping for more pages.
2,Not effective,Took a lot of effort to remove dog hair from a couch cover. I gave up on it. I'm still looking for something that actually works.
1,Disappointed,The magnet did not pick up the pet hair off my furniture. I found it worthless. Using a glove was more effective. I am glad that I didn't spend any more money than I did for it.
2,It does not work on bed sheets for cat hair,"It does not work on bed sheets for cat hair, and that was my intended use for it, as my cat finds his way on to my bed when I am not home. If you are using it for that , i would suggest to what i have been using a lint brush, then lint tape roller. I am just happy that it wasn't too expensive to try out, but upset it did not work in this situation, I would assume it work work in others as it has other good ratings and that is what i based my purchase for this on."
3,"It's OK, not all that affective for me.",This product has a rubber like blade at the end that gathers the hair. For me it was still a lot of work. I tried it on my sofa and it gathered the hair to the end of the cushion. It was a little difficult after that to actually get that pile of hair removed.
5,Insanely Simple and Totally Awesome,"I love this thing. It effectively and efficiently removes the cat hair from my furniture. It works well on upholstery, cloth and suede. It does cause a bit of static on fleece. The tool itself is not anything remarkable. Just a hard plastic handle and a hard (non-flexible) plastic ""blade."" It is very easy to operate - just hold surface taunt and ""scrape"" and it does not ruin or mark my sofas in any negative fashion. It (obviously) takes some physical effort to remove the hair, but the results are really worth it. It works much better than sticky tape or rollers or really any other thing I have tried to remove cat hair from the furniture. I have two cats, both with short, dark hair. They shed a lot. So the Pet Hair Magnet is cheap and a minor miracle worker."
2,Poor font choice ruins a good book,As a teacher who uses graphic novels to motivate children to read I was aghast at the ugly unreadable font that was used for this book. I had one student afraid she needed glasses when I handed her the book. She finally gave up and asked to read something else. Many students who are fans of Bone have tried this and they all gave up. This is from a class that enjoyed all the other Bone books. I thought it was just too hard to understand till I looked at it myself. I have a hard time understanding how an editor approved this font choice for a well written and beautifully illustrated book. If you can't read it...what's the point? No student wants to read it; I haven't removed it from the class library because the artwork is detailed and enchanting. What a waste!
5,Must have for BONE fans!,"He saw this somewhere after reading the series but I caved in and ordered it anyway and it was a fun book, he loves it. For middle grade or upper-elementary boys it will get them to read. It sets up the scenario for the other books."
3,We love Schleich!,This girl doesn't stand up for us. Does anyone else have that problem? In all other aspects it is the same high quality as all the other Schleich products - of which we own many. All the other figures we have stand and fit together extraordinarily well.
3,good read,"This is a good book to introduce someone to the concept of reincarnation. If you've already read a few books on the subject I would actually recommend the various books by Brian Weiss, which in my opinion, are much more in-depth and informative. But nonetheless this is an entertaining read and worth the purchase if you're interested in beginning your journey into the world of reincarnation."
5,Powertools for Women in Business,"Aliza Sherman writes a powerful guide filled with tips and tools that inspire, challenge and help you grow professionally and personally."
3,ok game,"First of all id like to say that this game is pretty fun, but it doesnt compare to other rts games like say starcraft, but it is creative. Also that kid who says he is a marine ""genaral"" is wrong about the alien battle system. It can get frustrating when you suddenly get attacked and you dont have enough aliens for a strong defence, but you dont have to chase a potential host into your nest area, unless you are using a certain type of alien, attacking someone wont kill them, it puts them in a coma and you can assign a drone or something to drag them back to your nest where a facehugger will do the rest. So, I dont believe the aliens are that bad, i think the predators are the least fun. if your interested, rent the game first."
5,A necessary Guide for survivors .,If your loved dies suddenly or you know its coming this is the essential book to read about handing the situation.A compact guide on what to do when and how. It brings together in one easy to read and understand format the information you will need immediately after a death and later on.This is a book to have on hand as you would have a dictionary.When my mother died I found it was dificult to get the information I needed. Laywers can be very expensive. If I had this book it would have saved my time and money.
5,Great piece of film,This documentary was liking watching a newsreel of the time and the place where the stars were working and promoting this wonderful piece of work. It's historical and quite memorable of the achievement in the film itself which behind the scenes also had its dramatic twist and turns.
2,Works but not great.,"After getting this unit it was easy to setup, but has a mind of it's own. When you program it, it makes it's own channel selections. If you are wanting to use it and fine local channels it will find them but they will be every mixed up. Channel 2 might be 8 local, or 12 might be 3 local. It will work on outside antenna (don't have cable)and find more than the old TV did. But after about 4 months ( 1 month after warrenty ended) started humming then shutting off. After it cools down works about 15 min then quits again or gives a loud humming and the picture gets real screwed up.Don't recommend it for long use."
1,Avoid this thing,"I would advise you avoid this product. I have had this supposed tv tuner for three days and so far the only thing I have seen on my monitor is the product menu. I have attached to rabbit ears, a vcr, and a security camera. Nothing shows video. Good luck trying to decipher the totally unintelligible manual. It was amusing at first until I realized this was all the help I was going to get. I hope to be able to return this loser."
4,Lots of Fun and Legendary Mercury Sound,"Here's one of the Mercury Living Presence SACD reissues that really worked. (Some, likeRespighi: Ancient Dances and Airs for Lute Suites 1, 2 & 3don't sound quite as good for some reason.) The repertoire is what Beecham called ""lollipops"" -- not profound, but profoundly enjoyable from time to time (hence 4 stars instead of 5). The performances, by Dorati and the London Symphony, are full of life, very musical.And the recording, of course, couldn't possibly be better: Wilma Cozart Fine and her crew in their prime. If you liked the Mercury house sound back in the LP era, you'll probably love this. Yes, it's brilliant rather than clinically well-balanced. The soundstage is probably not the deepest you'll ever hear. But, hey, your ears will thank you with every castanet snap, every snare-drum roll.Highly recommended."
5,Spectacular,"Can anyone call this man anything less than a genius. He's astounding, his insight, spirituality, and hunger to save rival anyone I've ever read. I put him in the pantheon of other great conservative writers like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. All of their missions are clear and straightforward. SAve the children from the Devil and all that he seeks. Their work is good and just, their writing ability unassailable."
1,Save your money,Save your money and don't buy this DVD. The two guys who are on here don't even know how to play Hold'em correctly.
2,Informative but....,"I am so glad that I checked this book out from the library rather than buying it.Although this book was informative the dry wit they inserted into nearly every saint's bio was not needed and not welcomed by me. A little humor is a good thing and I love a good dose of dry wit, but to poke fun at saints is another thing altogether.Usually the prospective buyer of a book about saints is looking for strength, guidance and help. They don't want to read sarcastic comments on each saint.If you are someone that is looking for a good and informative book on saints you might be disappointed in the authors' attitude as I was."
1,Not funny. Just mean.,Its one thing to make fun of something you love (see the Bad Catholic's Guides). This was not one of those. There was just a mean spirited atmosphere to the whole thing. They didn't have an underlying appreciation for their subject.
2,As Kurupt goes...so does Tha Dogg Pound,"As a huge fan of Tha Dogg Pound since their first CD 1995's Dogg Food all the way up to the present day and current 2007 release Dogg Chit, I feel like I have to ask...Kurupt, what happened to you? What happened to those potent, lyrical sledgehammers you used swing back in the day? I mean after Kurupt's Space Boogie CD, His lyrics have been subpar. Dogg Chit is just more so the same disappointing lyrical content that has been present in past Kurupt solo CD's as well as recent Dogg Pound releases: Against Tha Grain,Daz Dillinger/ Young Gotti 1, Daz Dillinger/ Young Gotti 2, Same Day Different Shi* & Cali Iz Active. Daz on the other hand is still on point with his unchanged lyrical style. I never thought i'd see the day that Daz was lyrically better than Kurupt.I still think Kurupt can flow like he did back in the day. He just gotta go back to the lab and come up with them hard hitting metaphors cuz as Kurupt goes...so does Tha Dogg Pound."
1,No where as good as the others,We used to love the Baby Einstein videos. They were great!! Simple and captivating to the little ones. Then Disney took over and over produced them. We stopped buying them after Disney got involved.
2,Dull and simplistic,"Wow, what a dull DVD. My 20-month-old lost interest after about 10 minutes. The whole thing was a little more ""baby"" than I had expected. Maybe it would be o.k. for my 7-month-old but it doesn't seem very engaging...Not recommended."
5,Still one of my son's favorites,"For those of you who think your child might outgrow this simplistic DVD at a very young age, you just never know! When we take longer trips in the care, it is still one that my 3-year old requests for viewing. Definitely worth the money."
1,DON'T BUY THESE SHAPERS!!!!,"I BOUGHT THESE SHAPERS AND I THOUGHT THEY WOULD REMOVE ALL THE HAIR. I HAD TO KEEP USING ONE STRIP AFTER ANOTHER AND IT STILL DIDN'T GET ALL THE HAIR, AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE THICK EYEBROWS. THESE STRIPS ARE SO TIME CONSUMING!!! THE PARISSA EYEBROW WAX STRIPS ARE MUCH BETTER. I USUALLY DON'T HAVE TO USE NO MORE THAN TWO STRIPS TO GET ALL THE HAIR OFF ONE BROW, AND THE HAIR DOESN'T GROW BACK UNTIL SIX WEEKS OR MORE LATER. NO, IT WON'T GET ALL THE HAIR OFF WITH ONE STRIP EITHER, BUT IT IS SOOO MUCH BETTER. I HAVEN'T YET FOUND ANYTHING BETTER THAN THE PARISSA BRAND YET."
4,good,"wash your face first and then pull it quickly towands to your nose, it will works.although pains, but i like it!"
3,Gotta have more illustrations or pictures!,"Butch should have added more illustrations or pictures of the points he was trying to make. It is a challenge to visualize what the text was saying. In golf, you gotta see it!"
3,Well written but subtly prejudicial,"I found the book entertaining and engaging and I believe historically accurate. The battle scenes are well drawn, stark and riveting. The background stories are likewise well put together.However, I take exception to some of the author's characterizations of the Southern officers and men. It seems all the perverts, gaseous generals, and hypocrites are on the Southern side, while all the heroic, devoted, and noble warriors are on the Northern side.Perhaps if the book possessed a more balanced view of the attributes of the characters both Northern and Southern, it would rank as one of the better Civil War novels I have read.Barry YeltonAuthor of Scarecrow in Gray, a Civil War Novel"
4,Classic,"This album doesn't fail when it comes to beats thanks to Alchemist. Prodigy may pushes the Return of the Mac (10) theme a little too much for some people, but it doesn't distract form the great production and rhyme content for too long. Mobb Deep fans can pop their speakers to at least eight or nine of these tracks, and with 14 tracks on the album, that's a pretty good slug percentage if you ask me."
5,Good News about The Good News About Careers,"Barbara Moses, Ph.D., has written an interesting to read, timely book about a topic which is close to anyone who works, lives with someone who works, or is just curious about the changing nature of work. This is a thoroughly enjoyable read. The style of writing should appeal to anyone, from those thinking about retiring soon, to those just entering the workforce. For managers who want to keep the status quo, this could be a potentially dangerous read for your employees. It could cause people to rethink their lives, and possibly leave their current position for a new one. I highly recommend this book for anyone considering a career change or who is just trying to know themselves a little (or a lot) better. JoEllen Morrison, MLS"
5,Mac Book PRO,"Fits(From Caselogic Website):G4-15"" screenMacBook AirMacBook Pro 15.4 inchFits my MacBook Pro perfectly and offers a lightweight alternative for just commuting from the office to Starbucks or too meetings."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment...,"Well, it seems like EA Sports has ""settled"" on a formula for this game. The game-engine is almost identical to last years' version. In fact, the gameplay is 90% similar to NCAA 2002. Yes, it has some new bells and whistles, but the basic feeling I get from this game is that it is little more than a roster update. Why can't they just use the far-superior Madden 2003 game engine and just tack on college uniforms and playbooks? Anyway, the lack of a ""create your own playbook"" option is inexcusable in this day and age. Finally, the cheesy college band shounds are no match for the urgent ""big beat"" music we had in NCAA 2000, 2001, and 2002. If you own NCAA 2003, buy this update only if you are a CFB diehard."
4,SHORT REVIEW,"Anyone who has played the previous versions knows that this is the Benchmark of comparison for all other football games. Simply put, the BMW OF ITS GENRE!"
1,Flawed Design,"The pipe and hose connections leaked and Teflon tape did not help. If you use a wrench as directed then it scrapes the chrome off of the plastic and can even break it. To say that the removable showerhead is interlocking is not appropriate since it does not really lock into place - it really kind of just hangs into place. If you adjust the rain shower head downward, it can fall out. In fact it fell out and busted a hole in our shower!"
1,Good Idea - Bad Execution!!,"I bought this showerhead thinking it would be an innovative way to shower. Unfortunately, the knob to change between heads feels cheaply manufactured and ALWAYS leaked when I had both heads running. I tried using all the Teflon I could fit in order to remedy the situation, but nothing worked. I would love this product if it were made with good quality and worked properly from the moment it was installed. Until then.."
4,Luvtoskywatch,Very helpful. I am able to position myself to see through binocculars objects in the sky. Thanks for this book!!
2,"excuse me, a beginner's book?","Maybe I am even less talented than I thought, maybe I am just downright stupid, maybe problem is in my expectations, as I expected something more visual and less technical.. but this book is not a beginner's book. I bought a telescope for my son this xmas, and I wanted to know what the heck we are looking at once skies clear over Croatia. This book will not serve that purpose. IF I WERE an astronomy / physics anthusiast (NEVER!), THEN this book would have been a beginner's book."
3,Interesting concepts and techniques,"This book is essentially a workbook for speed reading and improved understanding. It makes use of mini-excercises that will remind you of the reading comprehension section of the good ol' SAT's. The whole point is to show you how to read books while minimizing time spent and maximizing your comprehension of the material. By the time I finished this book, I must admit that I was finding college textbooks to not be nearly as intimidating. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially students. The only downside to this book (and the reason I only gave it 3 stars) was that the book is a little rough around the edges. The style is dated and rather mundane, making it rough going for anyone who has anything less than a superb attention span. Overall this book was great considering it was published in 1988. It would be a winner if they updated it and published a sequel of sorts."
4,Who Wants to Live Forever?,"""Trackers"" is NOT the final episode in the Roughnecks saga -- in fact, it actually falls before ""Homefront"" chronologically. Also, fans of the previous discs in the Roughnecks series will be a bit disappointed that there's only a single episode on tap from the main menu... and some of the Special Features featurettes are simply rehashes of previous episodes.The quality is still high -- but if you haven't filled out your collection of the previous discs, do so first before picking up this disc!"
5,Trackers,The Best Anime I have seen. Wonder why they stopped making anymore series. I hope they make these more.
2,Animated film,"I did not know this was an animated film when purchased. I dislike cartoons, especially one made from a good movie. Too violent for kids unless over the age of 60. See this one if you must."
1,to short for what i paid,I paid for a full lenght dvd this was like a mini dvd. can i get my money back
2,made in 2006 or the 80's?,"I just wanted a video of up-to-date images of the Earth from space...I see short snippets of up-to-date images on the TV all the time, so thats why I bought ""Space Views"", but no, it looks like this footage was filmed around the 80's or sometime, poor quality indeed! Are we ever going to get a visually clear and beautiful film image of our planet, I mean havent we been out in space for fifty years now? I think its a conspiracy...because if we finally get to see how wonderful the place we all inhabit is, then a few of us just may change our minds on how we go about our business here!I would wait for the real thing, if it ever comes!"
4,Heaven is a delight,"Among those who give this book poor reviews the reviewers seem hostile. I don't understand this. I thought the book interesting and fun. It certainly is not a scholarly thesis, nor does the author claim it to be. It is a simple book explaining one man's idea of what heaven is like. I disagree with some of the author's doctrine and his interpretations of some scriptural passages, but taken on the whole, his viewpoints are credibly valid. I also believe his chapters on what it means to be a Christian are enlightening. I would recommend this book to others to read, especially if you have the idea that Christianity is austere or mere wishful thinking and that the idea of heaven is boring."
5,A Travel Guide to Heaven,"This was a very enjoyable, easy read that even my husband, who normally doesn't like to read religious things, liked a lot. It is not to ""church-y"" but is able to enlighten and explain a lot of information about how we can view heaven."
5,VERY PLEASED :),I'm giving this a 5 star rating because it is an excellent book in excellent condition and as said I am very pleased all the way around. I would recommend this too anyone and everyone!Happy Mom :)
4,A DVD that suits everyone's workout needs,"This DVD is great because your workout is always changing. Even if you are crunched for time, you can choose the length of your workout to suit your needs. This dvd is one that suits everyone because you can choose what you want to work on, for how long, and you won't get bored because the DVD changes the excercises so that each day your program varies."
4,Pretty slow paced video.,"The work out is pretty good, but it's just slow-paced. It's good for a beginner."
3,Doesnt live up to the potential,"I rented this game at Blockbuster a few weeks ago and i got bored with this game in three days. Batman, I admit looks pretty cool with the cartoon style, but this game has a lot of things wrong with it. The developers should have worked these things out before putting this game on the market. The cut-scenes and movie are pretty cool, but the lip-synch on the game absolutly [stunk]. I hate when you are in a fight and you cant get your item because you have to put the game in first-person, pick the right item, and use it. All the time wasted getting a item, your opponent was kicking your booty. Please, anyone dont waste your time or money on this piece of..."
3,"Quality, but poor fit","These shoes were excellent quality and superb in appearance. We ordered them in a size 13 and they slipped off at the heels of my husband's feet, so we contacted the company and exchanged them for a size 12. The toe, arch and instep fit was fine, but the shoes still slipped off at the heels.The company was professional and customer oriented, the shoes looked great, but they simply didn't fit at the heels. My husband is 6'2"" tall and weighs 272 pounds, so it's not as if he has narrow heels."
5,Great reluctant hero...,"Stanley Hastings hates pain, is often scared and doesn't particularly want to be a real detective. Unfortunately, people in need of help keep drawing him into their problems. After carpool mom, Pamela Berringer, comes to him for his help to get out of a prostitution ring, Stanley finds that he can't turn her down. When her pimp is murdered, Stanley must prove to the police that he and his client is innocent. This is a clever mystery with a likable but reluctant hero. If you like to read a series in order, start with Detective."
2,DON'T BUY!!!,I just got a game cube for christmas in which case i got two games tony hawk's pro skater 3 and Luigies mansion. I found Tony Hawks 3 quite good and Luigies mansion OK. Then at the beggining of January I got Super Smash bros. Melee Which was like the best game ever in my opinion. At the end of January I got Simpsons Road rage. There are only 2 good things about this game. Nmb1. The Graphics are great like all gamecube games. Nbm2. It's a good Multyplayer game. Now I have 7 reasons not to buy the game Nmb1. There are only six levels. Nmb2. After you complete the game nothing happens. Nmb3. There's no story line. Nmb.4 You can Only Play Up to 2 players. Nmb5. If it's basicly a remake of Crazy Taxi. Nmb6. I beat the game in 2 hours. Nmb7. After 2 days you'll just be trying to sell it.
2,Road Rage ok game,I bought this for my 9yr old. He has the Simpsons Hit and Run game... (which he had first). The hit and run game he liked much more. Better graphics... felt this was kind of a downgrade. Only played one day and went back to the other game
3,simpsons,MOVE YOUR KEISTER MEISTER ha ha. this is sooo cool ofer 30 charcters and6 huge worlds 2 player split screen and real character voices. the game is so cool but not so cool at times. THE GAME IS about mr. burns is bying the twons buses and makeing them radioactive and jacking up the fares now springfiedians must make ther cars in to cabsand buy the buses no time for donuts homer.
2,Lame,I was bored with it after an hour. The game is completely uninteresting if you are uing the 2-Player Head-to-head function. Not fun for anyone over the age of 14. Rent it before you buy it.
3,Value/Price Ratio is less than 0.5!,"I decided to speed through the book in a breeze. After Ifinished it, I like it more. I have to tell you this book is notwritten as a textbook or handbook. It is written for engineers to review or brush up certain subjects in the Digital Communication field. I study extensively on CDMA, I haven't seen any book says 5 Mhz is about right for the spectrum to pread in order to deliver good quality. I found it is a valuable number for me to remember for my work. For its content and presentation, I give it a 5 star."
5,Bean Products Yoga Mat Bag,Very happy with the yoga mat bag. It holds my mat with room for towel and water bottel. Plus I like the small zip pocket for keys.Bean Products Yoga Mat Bag Extra Large Easy Open Zipper 100% Cotton Made In USA
5,Great bag!,"This is a great, roomy, canvas bag. The color was rich and vibrant. I ordered red and I am hoping the vibrant color keeps over time. I liked the small zippered pouch, too. Perfect for IDs or money."
1,Nice Looking but terrible quality,"After less than 3 weeks the strap broke at the seams. While the bag is simple and nice looking, it is made terribly. Refund please..."
2,Just OK,I have a Manduka Eco yoga mat and it just barely fits into this bag. It's a little hard to get in. The bag does have a zipper so my mat is not exposed to the weather which is good since I live in MN. The little zippered side pocket is small. I can fit my ID and car keys in it. I can't fit anything in this bag besides my mat.
2,Not very large,"I was only able to get a regular thickness mat in this bag and a strap. I could not fit in a block or much of anything else. The shoulder strap is only 2 inches longer than the bag and doesn't extend, which made it awkward to carry. If you only want it to carry a mat and car keys, you should be fine. If you want to carry additional items, I'd recommend getting a different bag."
4,Good bag but not super big,"Haven't used the bag much so can't comment on its durability. Color is vibrant. Strap not adjustable but I'm not super tall so it's ok. Big thing is that it's reasonably sized but I wouldn't call it extra large. There is space for my mat (it's not a super thin one, so maybe 3/16""?) plus yogitoe to fit in there when rolled up together, with just a little bit extra room. It's adequate for what I need but might not be for everyone. I do have to have a separate bag for clothes etc. The pocket will be nice for keys and such. I do like this bag, but be warned, it might not be big enough if you have a ton of stuff you want to put in it."
1,American Curl Cat,"I purchased this book hoping that for the price, it would be an informative book. I was very wrong. It is a first grade level book, very short, and what information it contained could be used for just about any breed of cat. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this book to any adult, and especially not to anyone wanting information about this breed of cat."
1,Slacker!,I read ths book and it did not help me with my report alot. It does have good pictures though.

3,Nice Little Blanket,"This blanket is a gift we bought for our daughter and it is really thin, however it will do for her just to lounge and watch tv. Wouldnt recommend it, for those of you looking for a thick warm blanket. Its more of a throw. But it is a nice throw...Good for summer nights."
5,Great little clock,"This clock is wonderful. It doesn't take up a lot of room, buttons are easy to handle even if you have get up in the middle of the night and the green color is much calmer than the glaring red, most clocks have."
2,died after 6 months,The clock was simple and perfect for the guest bedroom. I plugged it in and didn't think about it until 6 months later when it just died.
4,Very Bright Display,"This alarm clock is simple and straight forward. You do not need to read the instruction manual to get it to work. Only downside is that the display is very bright. It could be used as a night light. Some people may not like the bright light facing them while they are trying to sleep, me for example. I decided to put it in the guest room."
4,Great Little Alarm Clock,"I love that this clock does not hog up space on my nightstand. It's simply an alarm clock with no radio, no selection for multiple (annoying) alarm sounds, no extra alarm settings, and no connections for iPhones or MP3 players. I agree 100% with other reviews that it is easy to use and set without having to refer to the operating manual. The numbers are not extremely bright and are large enough to see across the room. I have only one minor issue with this clock and that is that the on/off slider for setting the alarm is a little too stiff right now. Other than that I'm very satisfied with this little alarm clock."
3,Quiet,How does this wake anyone up? I wish it was loud. I like the green but come on my phone is probably 5 times louder.
1,Don't Bother with this Clock,"We purchased this clock based on the four star reviews from others. Please aware, however, that this clock stopped working properly after 41 days. The ""time"" button decided to fail, so we are no longer able to set the time--a pretty basic function of a clock. So back to Amazon it goes!"
1,Not what I expected,I thought this would be a wireless alarm clock and it wasn't but again I haven't received word from www.amazon.com if they've received my returned item or not and how soon I'll get a refund.
1,Lasted barely a month,"At first i was delighted that i had purchased a simple , useful product at such an amazing price. Then the classic adage of "" you get what you pay for "" sunk in. After a month , it started blinking and the time is just not resetting. I am thoroughly disappointed."
3,Not auto voltage,"I purchase this clock, not for alarming purposes but just for time and decore. My one mistake was that the clock is 110 Volts and cannot keep time, alway at least 2 hours behind. Where I live, we have 220 volts power supply, although the clock is pluged into a step-dowm transformer but it still wouldn't hold time. I don't know... the clock itself looks ok in terms of quality.... but just don't know."
4,So basic. Clock + Alarm. Alarm Clock. Simplicity is the essence of excellent design.,"This is a clock with an alarm. First one sets the clock with a few basic buttons. Then, and finally, one sets the time at which one desires an alarm to sound. Turn alarm to ""on"" or ""off"" based on personal preference, and voila.Regrettably, I must report that this alarm clock seems only to have one possible character of alarm-sound. Perhaps I am wrong, but if there are means to change the character of the noise, they elude me, which means they are not as easily identifiable as the rest of the interface. As it stands, the beeps are LOUD and ANNOYING enough to raise me from the deepest of slumbers. Recommended."
4,Great book for younger people!,"I Gave this book four stars because it was good but didn't keep me very interested. I love historical World War Two books but this one was not my favorite!This book is the sequal to ""A Boy at War"" which was also pretty good too! It's pretty short but is good at getting the whole story in. It describes the friendship that the main character Adam Pelko and his Japanese friend Davi Mori have. In my oppinion the ending is not that great either.Overall you should definately read ""A Boy at War"" before you read this book. I really do think younger people might like this book more than anyone else!I Hope my review was helpful to you!-JB"
4,A Boy No More,"If you like war or history books pick up A Boy No More. The main character is Adam. Adam's dad was in the attack on Pearl Harbor and is said to have died so Adam goes to find him. He still believes he is alive while everyone else thinks he his dead. A one point in the book, Adam is on the road and out of nowhere a Japanese plane starts to fire at him and the other cars around him. That is just a small part of the book and if you want to find out what happens to Adam you have to read this book. If you like action and nonstop reading, or if you want to find out if Adam's dad is dead or alive read this book. I give it two thumbs up so pick it up and read it!"
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this item because I needed something to help keep my hens warm in the coop at night when it is really cold out. I ordered it and had it send overnight from Amazon and upon opening the package I noticed that the instructions were in Chinese which was a put off to begin with. I plugged the item in and saw the orange light come on and waited.. nothing, no heat, or warmth. I waited an hour longer thinking that maybe it needed to warm up and again, nothing.Very disappointed with this product, theres going to be a chill this weekend and now I am stuck without a heater!"
1,Poor packaging.,"Love the concept, worried about freight damage. Received with side smashed where cord goes in to unit. Should be packaged better. It still works, still deciding if I want to hassle with returning it."
3,"Great, but not warm enough","I got this heater for my bird based on the many reviews from other people who got it for the same purpose. Although the heater is great if you just need a little boost in temperature, it does not give off enough heat to compare to the fan driven heaters. It was enough for my birdroom until the temp dropped into the 50's, then I had to turn the blowing heater back on. So, again... great product unless you live in a very cold climate."
2,disappointed,I had hoped it would do the trick to keep my legs and feet warm under my work desk. Fails at doing so. Looked like a good item but it just doesn't do much.
5,Economical and efficient heater,"I bought this heater for our bird cage to keep them warm during cool season. Its radiant model works just great, zero noise, distributes the heat evenly and does not disturb the birds like the regular fan heater models that not only not energy efficient but also really noisy. And best of all, it uses only 100W - try to compare it to any other regular heater that would eat 750W-1000W minimum. Got it amortized in less than two months. The overall dimension is about 16""x22""x1"" so it can be placed anywhere. I'm glad I found this one and Amazon is the best and least expensive place to buy from."
3,Good heater but comes without a stand or way to use the heater,"These are the 4th and 5th of this brand I've ordered. The first 3 I bought at Sam's and they came with stands for the same price. These two came with no way to set up the unit. The stand costs extra. Come on, that's just a bit obnoxious. I think the heaters have worked really well for my needs-- I have 3 poultry coops and have 1 in each small coop and 3 in the larger. They are great because the birds can go and lean against them and a fire doesn't start (at least not so far). The birds don't usually do this, but it's nice to know they can without issues.They definitely don't raise the temp of a room a huge amount, but, then again, they don't cost a whole lot to run, either.Our night time temps are about 0 to -5 and these little heaters have kept the well insulated coops at around 30 degrees."
4,compares favorably with Bernard Cornwell.....,"I've been a historical fiction fanatic for many years, but just recently started reading newer fiction of the Roman age. Scarrowcreates a believable setting and the characters emerge with multi-dimensional traits which hold my interest. I'm not an expertin Roman history, so I read books by historians in an effort to keep the dates of the battles and countries in which they occuraccurate. To my knowledge Scarrow works hard to create a ""believable"" fiction. So I gave this book 4 stars. I am alsoaware that others in the genre writing about the same incidents, disagree. That is why I held out one of the stars."
5,Wisdom of the Void,"I have a fascination with nothing[ness]. PATTERNS IN THE VOID is therefore the perfect addition to my collection of books concerned with the void (THE HOLE IN THE UNIVERSE, THE BOOK OF NOTHING, etc.). But beyond that it is a really interesting and deep book. A combination of lyrical prose, cutting-edge science, personal anecdotes, and philosophical musing conspire to create a thought-provoking book that will change the way you look at the world around you. Though at times morose, sometimes downright depressing, it is still in the end a powerful and approachable addition to the genre. Highly recommended."
3,Clumsy controls; PS2-port graphics,"By the poor standards of Batman games, this is not bad; it's pretty true to the animation's style and it's got a fair number of cool gadgets and vehicles. But the graphics are really sub-par for an Xbox title--it's clear that this was a first-gen PS2 game that was ported to the Xbox with no visual improvements.The controls are also inexact and confusing. Too often you need to be in exactly the right spot for an action key to work; for example, to handcuff a downed enemy you can't just be around him, but need to be in some mysterious position near his feet that seems to change with each instance. And some jumps need to be pixel-perfect--frustrating!I'd recommend this for Batfans only. Our household Bataddict (age 4.5) loves it, but his Dad has to do all the hard bits, which is to say most everything, simply because of the clumsy design."
1,From A Veteran Gamer---Don't waste your money,"This game is awful for several reasons.1. The controls are awful2. Way too much jumping around3. Poor Storyline4. You can't really use the gadgets during combat you mostly just punch.5. The cut scenes like racing and flying the helicopter are next to impossible with the controls one bad turn and you get the I failed message, and you have to start all over again.6. Lack of being able to save at any point.Other than that it's great, Ha ha.If you want a Great Gaming experience trade this game in for Halo, Max Payne, or Blood Omen 2 Even it it takes 3 for 1."
1,Boring,"This has to be the worst Xbox game I have ever played since I have owned the machine. The graphics could be better, the storyline is weak, and the levels are extremely boring. Placing enemies few and far between so there is very little action. Also, you can't skip through the videos during the game, which are really boring, and long too. I'm very glad I rented this game instead of buying it."
4,I like it!,I was disappointed that this wasn't the more intense P90X Ab Ripper X version (it's one of Tony Horton's earlier routines) but it still provides a good workout in an extremely short amount of time. It may not be for beginners though. I would recommend it more for individuals who have already moderately developed their abdominal muscles.
4,A Good Airbrushing Book,"This is one of my favorite Airbrushing books. The author gets right to the point without wasting words or paper. This is a perfect book for anyone wanting to get started into the Airbrushing Art Form. The necessities are covered and the basics are well explained and detailed. The "" skills "" training section is like most of the basic skills books but this book doesn't waste a lot of words getting to the point. It's clear, concise and to the point. A great book for beginners at a good price and I can recommend it with a clear conscious."
4,Good Book For The Begginer,"This is a well thought out, and very informative how to airbrush book. It covers a lot of information needed for the begginer airbrusher. It has answered a lot of my questions."
2,"Odd Criteria for ""Modern""","I was disappointed with the book and returned it. Nothing by Robsjohn Gibbings. Nothing by Harvey Probber. Only a single piece by Wormley. Only two by Finn Juhl. Instead, the selection seems weighted heavily toward austere Italian designs of metal and glass, esp. those produced in the 1960s and later. I did not expect the editors to show such a lack of interest in wood. And given the book's definitive-sounding title, I did not expect them to adopt such an rigid and uninteresting definition of ""modern."""
4,new edition,did not someone write that they are coming out with a new edition in fall 2004? this is the only problem with this edition. it is not updated. soon to be resolved it seems.
4,Wasn't as thrilled as everyone else,"Maybe it is because I read a lot of suspense and thrillers, but I kept waiting for somethng to happen and nothing ever did. I enjoyed the book, well written, and kept me intrigued and reading till the very end, however I felt let down with the ending. I guess I wanted something dramtic to happenand it doesn't. If you can handle that,then the book is worth reading."
