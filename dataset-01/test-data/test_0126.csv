5,Another Side To Zane!,"Shame on it All shows another side to Zane. This book was not only about sex but about the sometimes turbulent relationships between Harmony and her two younger sisters Bryce and Lucky. I really enjoyed this book, although it was erotic, it was also funny as hell. Some of Zane's so called loyal fans, didn't really give this book the credit that it deserved. I love the other side of Zane, and I really hope that she continues to write a broad range of stories that explore not only our sexual emotions but others as well."
1,I wish I could get a refund,"I've been a fan of Zane's website for for about 6 years and decided to give her books a try. I was disappointed with the 1st one I read but I was in the airport waiting for a standby flight and said ""what the heck..."" Now I regret my decision. This book was HORRIBLE!!!! The dialog is sophmoric and ignorant. The situations in the book are unrealistic and stupid. Come on...A brothel of well hung midgets?!?!?!? Get real!!!! This book did not allow me to escape into an erotic fantasy. It just made me sit there and wonder, ""what in the hell is she smoking to have the audacity to release a piece or poorly written trash like this...?"" I'm sorry Zane, but you will never get another one of my hard earned dollars. Only those that have little or no literary intellect and have never read a decent book would find this one entertaining. This book is an atrocity to the publishing world."
3,Lack of Reality & Substance,"While I'm all in favor of highly educated women ""keeping it real,"" this trio of sisters is a little far-fetched. Navigating through their endless ghetto fabulous lingo, it is hard to stay focused on the fact that one is in medical school, one dealing in the stock market and the other heading up her own temp agency. Don't get me wrong - it was a good and humorous read; Shame On It All has everything from commercials to midgets (yes, I said commercials!). The three California-bred, turned D.C. resident sisters - Bryce, Harmony and Lucky - definitely keep the drama coming. Unfortunately, some of it seems a bit unrealistic at times. I also wish the author dove a little deeper into the heart of these sisters. ""Whatever!"" and ""Shame on it all""...two phrases I can do without for a while. Take the hint...I am a fan of Zane's work, but considering the foregoing, I'm going to have to give this one only three stars."
3,Not too deep...,"A quick read, these characters left a little to be desired. They lack the depth I look for in a good book- a bit too much bickering, stereotypical banter and lack of true emotion in the beginning, but as the book goes on, the ladies of Shame On It All become more interesting and worth getting to know better. Not one of the best by Zane, but not worthy of total disregard."
2,HORRIBLE shame on the bad writing,thou this is her first novel i am cutting her alot of slack i mean this booked dragged and dragged i think by the time she got 2 addicted she had the hang off it casue this right here is not hittng n e thing at all 2 me. long drawn out 4 nothing at all. so i do say shame on it all 4 just a long drawn out book with nothing there 2 grab u and no intesity at all.BBBOOOO!!!!!
5,CLASSIC,One of there best concerts ever recorded. A true classic if you are a fan of Paul and Garfunkel a must see.
5,Great Concert,I am more than happy to have this concert. It was great to hear and see it again. Music doesn't get any better than this.
5,A Wonderful bit of Memorabilia,"A truly wonderful concert! A tribute to the true poets of the 60s. The concert includes many of the best loved compositions from the S&G years: Mrs. Robinson, The Boxer, America, The Sound of Silence. It is truly a gift from the past. Drama here too: an ominous moment when Paul is singing about Lennon's death (The Late Great Johnny Ace) and an audience member rushes him--he finishes the song fine. What is most enchanting is to see the two of them enjoying themselves, and enjoying each other. For all of those (like me) who have worried about whether friendship survives after the breakup (so many of them) of the great acts of the 60s, it is wonderful to see these two pat each other's backs. They enjoy each other, and the music shows it. Marvelous concert!"
4,Wonderful music but not quite the same,"The Simon and Garfunkel Concert in Central Park was a historic event and very special for those of us who relished their songs and talent in the 1960s. I found that the years have taken a toll on the edge that their songs had 40 years ago. The music was more sweet and round. In this sense of edge versus round, I was a bit disappointed, but I enjoyed seeng them together again and hearing again the classics. And, the Central Park location in the summer added a context that is as timeless as their sound."
3,"Great Music, but poor concert manners from S&G","I won't repeat what the other reviewers here have stated. Just great music all through the video. My only complaint is, part way through the video, Paul and Art look as though they can't wait to finish the concert and go home. It's evident by the expressions on their faces and their body language. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable to watch this video--to see S&G act the way they did in front of their fans, who just wanted a nice concert experience. I was disappointed that these two professional musicians could not keep their feelings to themselves. Shame on them. I would give this concert 5 stars if the atmosphere between S&G had been better. Great music but very poor manners from Folk/Rock's best-known duo."
3,Simon & Garfunkel - Central Park,"Looked like a great concert, but this duo was sadly let down by the sound men. Their voices were largely drowned out by the music and background noise."
2,what a letdown,"I love all of her books but after reading the excerpt to this one (before it came out,and obviosly before she wrote more than a few pages) I was VERY disapointed. this was supposed to be some kind of medieval/timetravel thing (called waters edge) and she suddenly turned it into a contemperrary novel. whats the idea? I guess she just couldn't go forward with the plot, still I think it WOULD have been a very good story!"
2,Disappointing,"After waiting forever for this book to come out, I was hugely disappointed. I found it hard to believe the romance between the two main characters after some of the plot developments and Leigh, the female lead, never made me feel anything for her. Instead, I found the romance between secondary characters Mack and Sam to be more entertaining which is why I gave it 2 stars. Ms. McNaught makes reference to Matt and Meredith Farrell of ""Paradise"" frequently, which you are better off reading, or better yet, pick up ""Perfect"" again for a REALLY good read!"
3,M Ferrie,"After the delay in the publication, I couldn't wait for this book to arrive, but what a disappointment.The characters lacked Ms McNaught's normal depth and humour. Too much time was spent on the Police investigation and not enough with the lives of the main chatacters.How I wish she would forget about trying to branch into mystery writing and return to her normal style of romantic novels."
2,Definately not her best,"I wish Judith would stick to what she does best..... plain old romance. Perfect is my all time favourite book, along with Paradise and Tender Triumph, Whitney, Something Wonderful and Once and always. Her last two books have been sad in comparison. Judith just doesnt do suspense well. Half way thorough this book I was wanting the two female lead characters to get together....The men were boring. The story wasnt that great, and in places it was unbelievable. No way would someone who was that much in love with their husband fall head over heels with someone else. Two romances in the same story was just confusing, and I had no idea who the girl was who was from the previous novel until she spelled it out. Forget this novel by Judith, if you want qualtiy suspense/romance, try Elizabeth Lowell instead... she knows what she is doing!"
2,This is trash.,"This book was total trash. I would have liked it a lot better if the romance was taken out of it. It would have read a bit more intelligent. Instead, it was more like a dime store romance novel. And I agree with everyone who said it, people do not fall in love and marry someone so quick after losing their husband."
3,Someone to Watch Over Me,This latest novel of Judith McNaught was disappointing. The flashbacks were distracting and it did not make sense to the latter part of the book. The relationship between the main characters and minor characters did not seem to be realistic.
1,Frustation,"I`m completely frustated. Like rflins said, this book is horrible. What happened to you McNaught? Did you really write this book?!!!"
2,Very Dissapointing,"Being a huge Judith McNaught fan, I went out and bought it the week this book came out, only to be extremely dissapointed. This is the first time reading one of her books that I was able to put down, and reluctantly pick back up. I found myself skipping ahead pages hoping to find the story get more interesting. I'm still anticipating her next book, but I hope it's a lot better than this one."
2,Disappointing,"I love reading Judith McNaught. But, this book can only be discribed as very, VERY disappointing. I never got into her characters. The books drags, and drags, and drags. When Ms. McNaught burst on the sceen with Whitney My Love, I found her writing of historical romance to be extraordinary! ""Whitney"", and most of the books that followed were in a ""super"" league of their own. The plots were great, the dialogue superb, and the stories magnificant. But her last three books have made me reluctant to buy any more of her writing. There is an old saying, ""if the wheel is not broke, don't fix it!"" I wish Ms. McNaught would revisit the writing style of her earlier books."
1,A Waste of Paper,"This book was just awful. The characters drifted in and out of the story and the reader ended up never knowing any of them. Who were the main characters anyway? If JM intends to write another book, perhaps her publisher should suggest an outline. Maybe we'd get a story that made some sense. I don't think I would have finished this book, but I am a big fan of early McNaught so I thought for sure there would be some substance at the end. No such luck!"
1,Sophomoric effort,I had a very hard time getting interested in this book. It was flat. Also unbelievable in parts. This author's books used to leave me with a memory of what the book was all about. When I finally closed the book I never thought about it again. There was nothing memorable about it at all. Certainly it was not one of her better efforts. A grave disappointment for such a good author. Bad hair year is the only defense I can come up with.
3,Quite a disappointment for McNaught fans,"Judith McNaught is, by far, my favorite all-time author. That said, I was very disappointed to find that her long-awaited book was of the mystery/suspense genre. In my opinion, it is not her strength. It was an enjoyable read, but not up to her usual standards. The plot was bogged down with tons of police room banter and lacked character background.Judith McNaught is THE BEST romance writer ever. Her romances have unforgettable characters and beautifully developed plots. Please write us a new romance!!!(I feel like a traitor to write a luke warm review about an author for whom I have the utmost respect.)"
1,Good Grief,"The first Judith McNaught book I read was A Kindom of Dreams and I've been wondering if I would ever fall in love with another character like I'd fallen in love with Royce Westmoreland. So hungry to find such a compelling and engrossing love story as that one, I RAN to the bookstore and, unfortunately, ran into this book. What an atrocity. It's just, a real lame story. Going from A Kingdom of Dreams to this was like leaving wedding to attend a funeral. Skip this one."
5,The Best of Tenchi Muyo!,"I recently purchased this anime and I must say it was the best! I'm a really big TENCHI fan, but I didn't expect the movie to be so good. The sound effects were unbelievable as well as the backround music. The animation made the characters seem so lively. The plot is really good too. There was some comedy, and a lot of action. In other words... it was perfect! I own the dubbed version. The voice actors did a great job. I love this movie and I hope everyone who watched it feels the same way.(I only had it for 4 months but I watch it everyday...almost.) Tenchi Muyo in Love is a must see for every TENCHI fan! Alright,you don't have to love the series to see this..."
4,"Movie Great, Extra's stink.","This movie is good but the extras and main menu could have been better since they upgraded the movie to DVD, but if you already have the VHS version don't bother getting this one. But besides that it's all good.^_^"
1,I Spit Upon It,"Tenchi Muyo is one of the top 3 reasons why I have begun to intensely dislike Japanime. Mostly because, often, it had no plot whatsoever and just annoyed the hell out of me. However, I was conned into watching this horrible video, which I am proud to say I burned afterwards. Anything with the Tenchi name upon it needs to be thrown into a pit and burned for being an offense to writers everywhere. And I swear if I hear that stupid noise that Rabbit-Rat thing makes ever again, i'm going to find it and shoot it."
5,"This movie got me hooked on the series, and anime in general","All I can say aout this is that it is amazing. stunning. a masterpiece. I recorded this from the sci-fi channel and let a few friends borrow it. I never recieved a singlebad comment, besides those of Tenchi himself. After seeing this, I found out a lot more about the series and bought several episodes. I rank this with the classics, such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell"
2,Acid-jazz casualty,"After chancing upon Galactic's rather remarkable live show at a local bar, I jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc. Wasn't worth the effort, I'm afraid. Velveeta on Wonder Bread-dull collection of acid jazz duds. Not bad as background noise for your next dinner party, but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make Galactic such a great live act. A pass for all but Galactic completeists, if such an animal exists."
3,Live performance in Boston Club for completists.,"It's always great to hear Charlie Parker playing live, but this recording does not stand among his most brilliant works."
3,Microsoft Office 2000 Too Simplified,"I felt this book was very inadequate for any real knowledge of Office. It gives simple explanations of the basics, but then what? I sent it back"
1,Goosebumps,"I also am unable to avoid an outbreak of goosebumps. Amen, brother music fan! Friggin' goosebumps is EXACTLY RIGHT, buddy!! The very existence of this piece of noisome Christian dung is all the evidence I need to disprove the existence of god... and i mean ANY god. Lord have mercy! This monumental piece of life-changing dung begs the immortal question ""WWJV?"" - Where Would Jesus VOMIT?brother rob"
1,Carman is obviously Charismatic,"John F. MacArthur's book ""Charistmatic Chaos"" has helped me revaluate the dake-bonoist doctrine expressed by this work. My previous endorsements must be considered null and void. I cannot promote the errors within."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this album. Besides the almost twenty minute long cover of The Byrd's Eight Miles High, ""Landing"" and ""One Huge Road are great songs with some nice rocking out on the guitar, and ""My Everyday's Torture"" is slower and moody, but still good. ""Song Of A Devil's Servant"" is the low point of the album. This album has a more basic ""American"" feel to it. Too bad there's only a few songs, since ""Eight Miles High"" took up so much space."
3,not their best,"Golden Earring (or Earrings as they used to be known) is without a doubt the Flagship of Dutch pop music and is still going strong today. This album is however one of their weaker efforts, which can't be saved by the (famous) title track (originally by the Byrds) which used to be a big live favourite for the Earring.If you're new to the Earring you'd be better of with the 2CD (or the 4CD boxed set of ) 'The Devil Made Us Do It'."
5,Boomers workout,"As a boomer I wanted to do some easy simple exercise routine with 5 Lbdumbbells to stay in shape and maintain my weight.This is it. The Exercises are very well explained shown and done at apace easy for me to follow along. There is a warm up, about 25 minutesof different exercises with the dumbbells which are done for all themuscle groups. She first shows and explains how to do the exercisethen starts to do 2 sets of 10 times each exercise. It took me a fewdays to get used to the routine now I do both sets easily and feel thedifference in my strength and endurance. It gets easier with time.The DVD is filmed on a nice sunny beach which makes it enjoyable towatch. I now listen my own music since I am used to the routine.I Recommend it."
1,Boring,Seemed very uninspiring not much instruction and the music is horrendous. Had to mute the sound because it was so harsh on the ears
2,SAME DVD AS BEGINNERS,"As another reviewer said, THIS IS THE SAME DVD AS THE BEGINNER'S DVD, only different cover and name. ""Sunshine"" (whoever that really is) is NOT wearing that USA outfit in this DVD. It really is exactly the same one as the Beginners.I gave this 2 stars because although the workout is excellent - I felt different and stronger after only doing it 2 times, the company is really horrible for selling the exact same workout with a different label, and ""Sunshine"" in a different outfit on the cover.Amazon, you need to add a description to the review you give that this is indeed the same DVD as the Sunshine Beginners DVD."
2,Not good,"I was disappointed after reading this book. I expected more, given that the authors were employees of the UN mission in Kosovo. Therefore I expected some insider information, but there are few and they not important. Anyone who knows essentials about Kosovo's (pre-1999) history (my absolute favourite book on this topic is Tim Judah's Kosovo: War and Revenge) and has been keeping informed with events after 1999 will not miss this book."
1,bad package,due to bad package book twisted and pages damaged.please be more careful .. . . . . . . . . .
3,No problem here,"If I had read the first review I probably wouldn't have bought this oven and would have missed out on a nice one. I've had no problem with the knobs or the markings. The door fits tightly and the full glass makes it easy to see the food cooking. The rotisserie turns evenly and it is not loud like the ones I've had before. For the price it is a good oven. I paid a little more for one then the price here, at a restaurant supply house. Many food vendors use this model. It bakes my pies, biscuits, and casseroles. It rotisseries my chicken, ribs, hot dogs, and roasts. The oven capacity is much bigger than it looks, and my round pizza stone fits. The top heating/steaming tray steams veggies while the oven bakes. I make yogurt in it twice a week as it holds the low temp needed for as long as needed. I'm sure I could buy a better counter top oven but I have no regrets buying this one."
5,Sweet story!,"I enjoyed reading this story, especially since my mother recommended it so highly. My uncle recently passed away from Alzheimers and my family suffers from both depression and anxiety. So we found the subject especially poignant. I enjoyed the plot twists and character development. I found it a profoundly sensitive book."
2,It eats my cassettes,"Works ok as a radio, but after 6 months use, it's started chewing up tapes at a rate of about one in three. Looks like you get what you pay for."
4,I enjoyed this DVD,"Another in the ""Walking with..."" series from BBC, this is up to their usual standards. The beasts chosen are a mix of familiar and unfamiliar. I enjoyed watching this while laid up and recommend for anyone."
4,Fantastic show that loses points for editing,"This was a great sequel to Walking with Dinosaurs. It is probably the most informative show about early mammals ever made. The animation and scenery are beautiful and the sound does what it has to. Unfortunately I cannot give it 5 stars because the Region 1 version has been edited. If anyone wants the full BBC version, they will have to get the Region 2 version."
4,walking with beasts,"THIS IS ALMOST AS GOO AS WWD BUT IT SHOES THE FIRS MEN AS APES. SHOULD THIS HAPPEN? BUT FORGET NEXT OF KIN AND WATCH NEW DAWN, WHALE KILLER, LAND OF GIANTS, SABRE TOOTH AND MAMMOTH JOURNEY."
4,Good,I bought this for my 7 yr old son who is obsessed with anything prehistoric he loved it and it has been added to his collection.
4,"a ""must-have""","for any gardener's library. A great reference tool for anyone attempting to grow a nice garden despite the Midwest's unpredictable weather. Concise reviews of the plants most common to this region, with wonderful photos. Would like to see an expanded version with more unique and lesser-known plants for the adventurous gardener."

Read it, read it again, then download Shep's free iPhone App!"
1,Worst Slippers I have ever owned,"I wish I had kept the packaging, I would have returned them immediately. The foam cushioning is nice, but there is absolutely no support in the rear of the slipper, so my heals spin freely back and forth and make them totally dysfunctional as a walking device."
1,Check the return policy before U order!!!,"We had the worst experience with FurnitureBuzz. If U happen to not like the furniture or changed your mind shortly after U orded it, be ready to pay 3 TIMES MORE!!!! We did!!! They charged for shipping to us (which is understandable $39.44) and then also for the return $28.30. TOTAL $120.74 including the cost of the furniture piece!!! Don't waste your money. Even if something that U orded was inexpencive...We've never heard or experienced that a customer has to pay for a return. We REFUSED the package - DID'T OPEN it! Nobody charges for that!!! We're very, very upset. This is a robbery! FurnitureBuzz is the worst experience we've ever had!ALWAYS CHECK THE RETURN POLICY, before U order!!!!!"
4,Exactly what I needed!,"Not being a electronic whiz, I hardly knew what to choose when it came time to replacing my aging VCR. Price was a definite consideration. In opting for the Sylvania 6260VA Hi-Fi 4 head VCR, I figured I couldn't go very wrong for the money. So far, I'm really happy with the machine. It was easy to install, lightweight and compact. It works very well, excellent picture and recording. Only surprise was the rather noisy rewind and f/forward, at least compared to any other VCR I've had. On the plus side: those silly control buttons that light up on the remote? They turned out to be not so silly after all. They are very helpful in the dark or for people who don't see too well close up. Great value for the price! I recommend it to anyone who wants something simple and easy to operate."
3,Hot Guys In Briefs,"Like any David Decoteau Movie......there are plenty of good looking guys running around in tight boxer briefs for no apparent reason except for the viewer to see.There is at least a small story line here, but it is so predictable that you know exactly what is going to happen. There is also some good gore which is what most people are looking for in a horror movie, but this one is not scary.Turn done the sound...and just watch the eye candy"
4,Any serious Christian in the US should buy this book,Keener & Usry have done it again. This book is indeed a reference book that one can use again and again. The bibliography alone is over 67 pages of small print. This book will serve black Christians as a tool to help them defend their faith in the face of attacks from non-Christian blacks. White Christians need to look at it just to see what many brothers and sisters must face. Overall the book is a remarkable feat showing the beauty and depth of our Christian faith. Christianity can meet any intellectual assault that we might face. Praise God for this excellent book. Well done guys!!
1,DEFENDING THE RIGHT TO SELL A BOOK!!,"On page 113 the author writes: ""Truth can be found in varying degrees in many places, including documents used by various religions. This issue is not where some truth may be found, but by what means a person can be restored to full fellowship with God.""Truth is truth. No degrees, no conditions.IF YOU WISH TO QUOTE AND BELIEVE ERROR..THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!!RUN!!They will steer you into fiction. They are attempting to make their writing appear to be factual. They sight other writings which are dubious at best.They are writing on location...fantasy land.They are using every trick in the book to sell a book.RUN!!! DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!IF YOU WANT TO READ A BOOK...CONCENTRATE ON JESUS!!READ YOUR BIBLE!!!!I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Get what you pay for.,"Awful, cheap, horrible. I threw it away with minimal use. Light is not very strong, but mostly, the darn thing hardly ever works without smacking against your hand a few times."
5,Thank you.,I recieved this product in a timely manner and in the condition stated by the seller. Thank you.
3,Great for someone with absolutely no experience at all,"I used this book in my first Maya modeling class. I believe that the book is good because it takes you step by step on very basic concepts. On the other hand, the CD files for modeling polygons is weak, not well explained. The approach is pretty general for the topics discussed. I should say that the book is good to have an overview of the software and some of the tools, but not to have a strong base to start building advanced skills."
1,Disappointing,"We purchased this video to show it in our Church.We thought it would be an excellent choice with all of the well-known Truth teachers in the movie. In the end, we felt that we had made the wrong choice. We returned this video for a refund.It does not live up to it's expectations and the best choice for us is always a Wayne Dyer DVD of one kind or another, especially his movie, ""The Shift."
3,"Wanted: Lost Hooks. If seen, please return for Reward","Does it rock? Yes indeed. But where are the hooks? I have been a huge fan of the Foo's since the first CD. I must admit I am not very impressed with this new disc. I keep listening to it waiting for it to grow on me, but it is not. I know everyone is excited to have a new Foo Fighters cd out there, but I think when the dust settles, it will be considered thier least memorable to date."
2,Coulda been a fan....,"This was my first Foo Fighters album, so I can't be described as a long time ""fan"". It will, however, probably be my last. I bought the CD because I liked the first song, ""All my Life"", so much when I heard it on the radio. However, the rest of the album just doesn't hold up. There is one other catchy song, ""Times Like These"", I think, but the rest of the album is generic and boring. I gave it two stars for the one outstanding song.This is why I hate having to buy entire albums--9 [unacceptable] songs and two good ones for [the amount]? It just isn't worth it. ..."
4,"I'm a Foo Lover, not a Foo Fighter.","Another great album from the Foos. Upon first listen, my favorite songs are the final three-- Overdrive (with an incredibly catchy hook), Burn Away (emotional), and Come Back (pure guitar rock).Grohl is at the top of his game, and only getting better."
2,"Its Alright, But not Great","The new Foo Fighters album is simply an average rock album, there's nothing really special about it. The lyrics aren't bad but not great. The songs, unfortunately sound alot alike. The guitar parts are often similar and repetetive, although the vocals almost make up for it. By far the best song on the album is ""All My Life"", its definitely the most original song on the whole album, and none others sound remotely like it. Its not a bad album, I just hoped for more."
5,One by One,"This album is a peice of art that is like no other album this year. One of the tightest, most progressive and epic albums I've heard in a long time. One by one is a decidedly organic collection that takes some killer guitar work to the bank, as evidenced by the lead single ""All My Life"", ""Low"", and the squalling ""Have it All"". Dave Grohl and the gang are genious. The have made an album that entangles pop/rock, songwriting and heavy meat riffs and made it into an album everone can enjoy. This is definetly an album you will want to listen to over and over again and never get tired of it. So if you haven't hard it yet, then what are you waiting for, you won't be sorry you did. This is a must have album for any rock pig."
5,They DID deserve their grammy (or nomination)!,"About 12,000 grammy voters, who are music gurus and musically inclined people from the academy chose THIS album as the Best Rock Album because it deserved it. Foo Fighters are EXTREMELY talented. Dave Grohl is one of the greatest drummers and performers in rock today. That is why this is their fourth grammy (I think) that they have recieved in their career. To me this isn't their best album, but I thought it at least deserved the nomination and maybe even the grammy. (I was kind of rooting for Audioslave's debut cd..)"
3,Mediocre,"this cd was good after you listened to it a few times and began to pick the songs apart. but the first few times i heard it i fell asleep. but to Grohl's credit, his lyrics are very thought provoking and his song Halo was stuck in my head once i started listening to it. i still recommend There Is Nothing Left To Lose for the ultimate Foo album"
1,Copy Protected - don't buy it,"You cannot play this CD on a PC or make MP3's of it for your MP3 player. The audio quality is not very good, either. Steer clear of this one. Kinda sad when people actually buy the CD and they cannnot use it like they want to."
4,"Foo Fighters ""One by One""","Since first hearing Foo Fighters latest album ""Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace"", I've been a big fan of their music. I decided to pick up ""One by One"" after hearing ""Times Like These"" on a local radio station.Compared with ""Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace"", ""One by One"" is a good album, but it doesn't quite come to par with ""E,S,P,G"". ""Times Like These"",""All My Life"", and ""Overdrive"" are destined to become Foo Fighters classics, and the rest of the CD is just as enjoyable. I recommend this CD for anyone who is a fan of Foo Fighters, and if you're not, this is a good CD to start out with."
5,Getting better and better,"The first, self-titled album from the Foo Fighters would probably get a 4 out of 5 from me, which is pretty impressive for a debut album. Fortunately, these guys just get better and better as time goes on. ""One By One,"" their fourth album, is easily their best work yet. Storming out of the gates with ""All My Life,"" this album doesn't get stale or boring and never wears out its welcome. The songs vary a little in tempo, with some out-and-out rockers and some more sad, introspective-type numbers, but all of it is quality hard/alternative rock. This is one of those records that I'll listen to a bunch of times in a row, then kind of ignore it for a few months before pulling it back out and getting obsessed with it again. I don't think I'll ever get sick of ""One By One,"" and I don't think you will, either."
2,Not worth the 15 bucks,"It's hard to believe how a band can go from a musically brilliant album such as ""There's Nothing Left to Lose"" to such an aweful, uninspired, unimaginative, album like ""One by One"".I absolutely loved their last album. This album nearly makes me physically ill to listen to. Granted, All My Life is a decent song. But the rest of the album is garbage. Sorry Foo Fighters, but you've lost it."
4,Lacks Hooks,"In other words, it's hard to get into this album. Save for the furious attack of the first two singles, the Local-H-on-downers bummer ""Tired of You"" and the meticulously crafted ""Come Back,"" the songs are just there. And that's disappointing considering the three brilliant albums that preceded this one."
4,Its the same thing!! (More like a 3.5),"im sorry to say, but All my life is the best song on the CD, It is about the only reason i bought this CD. All the other songs on this i like, but remind me of their last CD too much.I dont hate it but i dont love it. the only reason i gave it a 4 instead of a 3 is because of The song All my life. Its a cd that is worth buying, but wont be one of your best buys."
1,Won't play,"I would like to say that this is the best CD ever from Dave G/Foo, but unfortunately, due to the complete shortsitedness of the dinosaur music industry -- IT WON'T PLAY IN MY CD PLAYERIf you buy this CD, intending to play it at work on your computer, save your money. It won't work"
2,Smear's influence sorely missed,"Its clear from this poor poppy attempt that the Foo's have let the standards slip with this release. Chris Shifflet's contribution with the guitar lacks substance and his arrival after the departures of Pat Smear and Franz Stahl has weakened the Foo's. Stand out songs are Times Like These and Low but overall the album lacks the quality of previous releases. Dave Grohl is a genius without a doubt but he lacks that little something without Pat Smear - my advice, don't buy this album instead go for 'The colour and the Shape' - far superior!"
3,"S'alright, but not their best.","While this CD does have highpoints, it simply doesn't have as many as their previous 2 efforts. I mean, All My Life, Times Like These, and Overdrive are great tracks, then there's Low and Halo and Tired of You, which are pretty good. But the rest is just somewhat mediocre. It could've been much better, and the mentioned songs are really REALLY good, especially Times Like These, too bad there weren't more tracks like it. I'd say buy the otherones first, but if you already have them and are a very avid Foo fan, then you might as well get it."
5,Foos never cease to amaze me....,"I think that One by One isn't as strong and isn't as good as The Colour and Shape, but it is an AMAZING album. Powerful and heavy, One by One is by far my 2nd favorite album. (The Colour and Shape holds first place) The Foo Fighters are an extremely talented band and they are my favorite forever. Dave Grohl's voice is so hard and powerful in 1X1 and the guitar riffs and parts are amazing. The harmonies are perfect. The drumming is CRAZY and amazing. (Thanks, Nate!) Overall, this is a cd that I would recommend for and Foo fan like me. It is an amazing album, and I strongly STRONGLY suggest you go right now and but it. Come on, click the but button right now.... :) Enjoy, I know you will!"
4,Great Story-Great Viewing,"This is one of my favorite films starring Burt Lancaster. Parts of it filmed in Levi Jackson State Park in London, Kentucky. My Grandmother introduced me to this wonderful film many years ago. It remains a favorite. I would reccomend this as a film that is worth the time devoted to it's viewing. Beautiful scenery and just very entertaining. My Grandmother always liked to relate to me of the many visits by the film cast and crew (including Mr. Lancaster) to the little restaurant where she worked in London, Ky. Give this film a try...they don't make them like this anymore. Classic story and classic actors !W. Davis, A Proud Kentuckian"
4,"quick and easy, but not very detailed","if you want more extensive detail and examples, just get the APA's own manual. if you dont care that much, this one will get you through a paper."
5,It really is easy,I use this as a companion to the actual APA Manual. I like how it tells you exactly how to format your Word paragraphs. It won't get me through a dissertation but it's great for beginners.
1,apa the easy way,Sometimes the easy way is not the best way. I would not recommend it to my students.
5,APA: The Easy Way,"APA: The Easy Way!This book I purchased along with APA Pocket Handbook. But this book has a different purpose. This is the book to use to set up your computer to write in APA Format (If you use word). This book told me exactly which keys to click, choices to select, buttons to push, the whole nine yards. Then once my computer was set up for APA, I started writing my paper. No matter how many times I stopped and did something else, the minute I opened back up my paper document, the computer shifted in APA format. I didn't have to reset anything. For someone who grew up using a typewriter, this is heaven. So, I suggest purchasing both books. One so you know how to type the paper and one to set up the computer. Makes writing a paper so much easier,especially for someone used to using MLA."
5,One happy student.,Using this book really clarified common mistakes I was making with the formal APA manual. This item made life much more easier. I was able to type my papers and get great grades without having to pay someone to type them for me and use proper APA formatting. Thanks for creating such a user friendly book.
3,APA: The Easy Way,"This book would probably be okay for a first or second year undergraduate student, but not sufficient for someone in a Masters program."
4,Great tool...,This book is great for anyone who is taking a writing course or any other academic endeavor that requires APA format. It's an easy guide to follow and provides concise reference for any question.
2,Not worth it,"I went ahead and purchased this along with the 6th edition of the manual. After looking at it, I see that it really isn't worth the money. Just spend a little more and get the full edition. It's all you need, and has a lot more than the basic info found here."
2,Not very detailed,This book is best described as an overview. It lacks detail and covers too many subjects.
3,Where Are the Children?,"This is the first and only (so far) book that I've read by MHC, She did a wonderful job with the suspense and the writing was very good. I found the plot a little thin and predictable. Overall I did enjoy it but I think I would have liked it even more if I was a bit younger. Something about the way it was written seemed a bit on the adolescent side. I'll probably read some more of her work from time to time."
2,Predictable,"This book was well written in that the dialogue was good and the descriptions were not too long and easy to visualize. It was very predictable, a couple of chapters into the book I already knew where the children were and with who. Also it was a very unsurprising ending. When she describes the house the children are going to be in, you can easily figure out where the climax of the book is going to take place and what will happen there. Also it was very annoying how she made some characters out to be more than they needed to be, for example Bernie Mills. We didn't need to hear about his family and how he wanted to tell his wife all about what was going on. This definitely is not Mary Higgins Clark's best book. It would only seem interesting and surprising to a pre teen kid."
3,great book for 13 year olds,"I found the suspense thin; the plot predicatable; the genre juvenile-gothic; the writing style -- well, there's barely a complex sentence anywhere in the book. The entire book is rather formula throughout, the type that usually gets returned to the author with a note saying, ""Try something else, like waitressing . . .""I find it difficult to believe that anyone would say this is the ""...best book I've ever read..."" unless they just simply haven't read much. I mulled it over in my mind if this would even make a decent movie but determined that it would take considerable screenwriting talent and mostly be unrecognizable from the book.But I was generous and gave it three stars. I also decided that I need to write, as well, now realizing my chances of publication must be considerably more than I ever thought."
3,she tackles an important issue well for 1975,"although she uses more profanity in here than i have ever seen in any of her books, it was an amazing read. it covered the issue of pedophilia with tact and precision but wasn't repulsive. i give it three stars because it was a good read but not as engrossing as some of her other novels. i figured out who the murderer was from the beginning, so i wasn't too shocked with the ending - just a little vindicated."
4,How wonderful is the author?,"Mary Higgins Clark is starting to become one of my very favorite authors. Her books are very well written with excellent characters and believable plots. ""Where Are The Children"" is no exception. The kidnapping plot and the life of Nancy Eldredge are very exciting. What people don't understand about Mary Higgins Clark is that her books don't end abruptly, she just smacks you right in the face with the plot and the climax right away. I love suspense and her style is superb. I would recommend ""Where Are The Children"" to anyone who enjoys a good read and doesn't like drawn out and over descriptive suspense. A couple of more of my favorites are ""A Cry In The Night"" and ""All Around The Town""."
4,Where are the Children is a good book ...,"Where Are the Children? is a mystery by Mary Higgins Clark. It takes place in a dull part of Cape Cod, in late autumn. It's about a woman that was accused of murdering her children in California. Nancy moves from California to Cape Cod to start a new life. She remarries and has two more kids. On her 32ND birthday her kids are kidnapped and she is blamed agian. It is clever, amazing, and thrilling. Just about every one will enjoy this book. I think it's great!"
5,Anne Perry's Farriers' Lane,I'm sorry I can't write a review for this because I did not receive it. I guess it got lost in the mail. I gave this a five star only because I like Anne Perry.
3,"A sensational, yet compelling account of Western water.","A book mixed with historical fact and the author's personal convictions and views. Although the book was compelling enough to read and laid down much of the history behind water problems in the West, it lacked objectivity and even-handedness in its narrative. Those familiar with works by Jeremy Rifkin will find a similar tone in Marc Reisner's sensationalistic approach to the topic (perhaps why it makes it a good T.V. script). A few footnotes and citations to back up his figures would have been helpful. Despite it's alarmist approach, it does provide a good introduction and background for those unfamiliar with one of the most politicized issues in the West."
3,Nightfood + Jaco and Bob,Features Jaco Pastorius and Bob Weir and songs by Marvin Gaye and John Coltrane.
3,Too big,"Yes, dimensions are listed for this product - but until it arrives and you see how HUGE it is in real life you can't get quite believe it. Quality was sound though, hence the three stars."
2,"Painted gray, not silver galvanized steel!","Very disappointed when we opened the box - painted gray instead of galvanized steel as advertised. We reluctantly decided to keep it and paint it to match our new blue metal roof. Just another task to add to the long list.....it's still not done.Buyer beware, not like going to a store and seeing what you're getting."
3,good but not perfect,"microsoft has done well to create a voice req program that can read and speak without programming it. however, i cannot start the program via my bluetooth headset and cannot hear the prompt in my ear. i can only communicate with the phone itself, defeating the purpose of a bluetooth headset. also, more discrimination needs to be added to media player; i cannot play only mp3s or just videos.recognitition is reasonably good, but there are times when it is simpler to just press the button instead."
4,Pretty good. Amazing program,"I wanted this for the safety. Driving down the road and looking for a phone number is just crazy. Voice Command solves that problem. Just mention who you want to all and keep on going. There are some times when it struggles with name recognition. Arnold Schwarzeneger would be a tough one but it generally gets it right. Works with every name in the address book, tells you when you have appointments, can be used to start software programs, and probably some more stuff I haven't figured out yet."
4,A Good Value,"What can I say,it's a great value for the person that wants good quality at a low price.I've owned a sylvania tv before and it lasted 9 years,so did the sylvania VCR I bought with it.I recently upgraded to a 4-head Sanyo though to match my new tv."
4,Blue Sky,This is a terrific movie regarding military life in the '60s. Jessica Lange truly deserved her Oscar and Tommy Lee is excellent and of course Powers Booth shows his narily side which he protrays so well in so many movies. I can't even tell you how many times I have seen this movie and I will watch it again and again.
2,Hyper City.,Blue Sky won Jessica Lange her second Oscar and boy her smoldering performance is over the top to say the least. She plays a manic-depressive and poor Tommy Lee Jones plays her military hubby. The story is pretty boring so pretty much skip this stinker.
4,A FINE COLLECTION,"This is NOT the best Superman stories of all time. What it is however , is a look at some of the best Superman stories from 1938 to 1989. if you enjoy stories from the Golden and Silver Age then you'll enjoy this collection. It has a very good Alan Moore/Dave Gibbons(the team that did Watchmen) story , ""For the Man Who Has Everything"" , which was selected by Wizard magazine as the #1 Superman tale of all time. Also , it contains an entertaining John Byrne story in which Lex Lethor learns Superman's secret ID(NOT an imaginary tale!!). Lots of work from Curt Swan and Jerry Siegal. The first Luthor , Mxyzptlk , and Bizarro appearances are inside. A very fun book."
4,not a classic but great playing,"the only reason i would not give a 5 star is because i reserve that rating for the ""kind of blue"" eque albums."
5,Art's Book is Cool,"This is the most Stupendous work in Classics since Herodotus. Art is even cooler than Socrates. He is more handsome than Pythagorus, and we think he is awesome. Go Art! It Makes You Think."
3,California Energy Crisis and Progressive Republicanism,"I read this book seeking the origins of Progressive Republicanism, the turn-of-the-century movement that gave us Public Utility Commissions and regulated public utilities (amongst other insitutions). In a way, the current California Energy crisis is a result of not remembering this history. Electric power companies are now doing what the Southern Pacific did to California, only in different ways.As literature, well, it's a bit goody-goody and overwrought for my taste, but I got through it without too much pushing. No, Mr. Norris is not one of our greatest writers. But, as business history, it should be required reading in all MBA programs!All in all, what we need is a new, updated Progressivism, one that will address the role of money in our political processes. It would also restore some limits on corporate exercise of market power while still encourage competitive enthusiasm."
3,The Octopus - eh!,"After reading The Octopus I was able to acknowledge the hardships of the farmers in California during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. I cannot say, however, that the book was very entertaining. It had a few climaxes, but none that really ""engrossed"" me. So, this is an okay history book, but I would not recommend it for fun reading"
3,"C'mon, he's not that bad","Like most reviewers, I found this a mixed bag but, overall, an enjoyable one. I am amused by the anger many reviewers directed toward Mr. Burnett for being what used to be called an ""egghead,"" and for not evincing the sort of ""common man"" false humility we demand of public figures. I found his candor refreshing and his willingness to portray himself in a harsh light to be very compelling.A small victory over the false and the bland."
3,Could have been better,"It is easy to pick on people that are less educated than you, and, if you are very well educated like this author, to do it in a way that seems less than mean spirited, however real people are difficult to understand and this is what the book unfortunately missed. The author approaches his subject ""critically"" rather than with curiosity. Because of his intelligance, his education, his experiance, etc., he obviously feels that he ""knows"" what he is talking about. And, about many things, some of which are in this flawed book, this is true. But, he could have learned many things and this is the problem with the book. While as a trial lawyer I found the book useful, I would hesitate to say that I also found it to be good."
2,Review by the lawyer on the case,"As the defense attorney who actually tried the case described in this book, I think this book is valuable just to see how Manhattan juries consider and decide criminal cases. As my wife, a writer, said when the book first came out, "" He wrote the book, so he got to make himself the hero."" You would think from reading the book that all the evidence fell from the sky and that I played no part in presenting the defense. An interesting read if you read it only to learn how juries work."
1,Do not waste your money,The concept of the book is appealing--an educated insider reveals the secret world of jury deliberations. The problem is that the author is a pompous academic. The book is written in extremely cumbersome prose that fails to appeal to the average reader. The author goes to great lengths to show us how smart he is but the ivy league vocabulary comes across as pretentiousness. I will not get into to specifics but the author also employs flawed logic in his characterization of the deliberation process. The author had the opportunity to write an insightful and meaningful piece but he let his ego get in the way of good writing.
4,Got this too?,"I was surprised to find this here, as I sort of thought it was proprietary from Earthlink. It seems a fairly good quality product in terms of manufacture with a nice design for its firmware. However, it seems to go out, and not be able to come online again for few months!"
1,Problems after a year,"The recorder worked ok but seemed to be made very cheaply, with a great deal of plastic. After having it for a year in which I used it, but not a lot, it now makes a clicking sound when it plays. I'm sure it won't last much longer. I would rather pay more and have an item work. I can not recommend this because of how quickly it has started to deteriorate."
1,horrible,"I doubt that they are all this bad. Maybe I just got ""lucky"". The first time I put the tape in, the motor could hardly pull the tape. When I tried to record, it played back all shaky, like a playing a record off-center on a turntable. I returned it."
4,Panasonic RQ2102 Shoe Box Recorder,"Good unit, but I don't really like the sound. I'm using it only for voice and durability of the player is important for me. It appears to be a well made unit"
1,No earphone port,"I bought this to transfer tapes to CD's. However, what they claim is a headphone port does not fit any standard earphone jack. It's meant to attach to speakers, not headphones."
4,oldie but goodie,"ordered this for my mother in law who is not tech saavy and wanted a recording device ""just like i used to have."" found this one and ordered it for her along with a pkg of new cassettes. she plugged it in and VOILA - very happy that it is same size and setup as her previous unit, sound and overall quality is just fine for what she's using it for. and best of all, she's comfortable with using it and its features. sure, it's a retro type unit and doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a more compact and versitile handheld digital unit, but sure serves her purpose. she's good to go!"
1,Shoebox best for shoes,My comments reflect judgements made on the copy I recived. A working model was not judged. The item recived had a loud audio whisle when in the playback mode. Efforts to contact the supplier proved to be fruitless so the item was returned.
1,Didn't Work! Don't waste your time!,"I got this tape recorder and plugged it in, but the tape heads wouldn't even turn. It made some sort of noise and that was the end of that. I had to return it for a refund. It felt very light and cheaply made--too bad-- I liked the looks of it. I am going to try another shoe box recorder from a different company."
4,Smashing debut!,"Blue strikes me as a non-conventional boyband. They churn out hits which, unlike the mainstream pop playing on the radio these days, have an R & B-ish twang which very much appeals to my saccharine-tainted ears. Be sure to check out stand-out songs such as Too Close, If You Come Back (both singles reached the No. 1 spot in the UK charts!), as well as Fly By, Best in Me amongst many other great tracks!"
1,Blue give me the blues,"When will our people learn? You see bands like these lot tearing up the UK charts, but you don't see genuine, but sadly underrated bands like Queens of stone age. Sorry, but this lot do nothing for me."
4,Semi-Tough,"This movie has nothing to do with sex or football, just timeless story of trying to get the girl.... Marketed as 'sex with a football' it missed most of the more inteligent people in the world.... this is along the lines of Leslie Nielsen or ""The Gods must be Crazy"" spoof movies, it is a spoof on EST, (the Forum, and other names), pyramid power, and maybe, even magnets... this is a story of getting ""IT""... con-artists and all.... It has jokes on the '80s soul seeking people and the company 'self-improvement' seminars.. control by the 'master' or if you prefer, 'deep tissue' massage, anything to 'release' you from the 'bonds' of your past... If any of these sound familiar this is your movie to laugh at... they did a good job here, but then maybe only coorporate people from California will appreciate this joke on the 70s, 80s, or does it go on....? You have got to get ""IT"", if you don't get ""IT"" then you don't get ""it""..... sound like a joke on religions, too?"
1,Semi-Terrible!,"Jill Clayburgh as Barbara Jane Bookman? haw haw haw OK, that is the only thing that is funny about this prolific disaster from the 70's.Dan Jenkin's hilarious off-the-wall tribute to the NFL and Billy Clyde's diary of the road to the Super Bowl is replaced by an introspective look at self-improvement fads and Gene Autrey music.You know, an adaptation of a book is one thing and one shouldn't generally get their hopes up that the film will match the story contained in any novel. However, this thing is not an adaptation, bears no resemblence whatsoever to the novel, and only the title and a few characters however retooled they may be remain. Pitiful. 1 Stetson"
1,worked..... Past tense.,Worked when I first purchased the wire tracker. Went to use it yesterday...... No good. I replaced all the batteries.... No good. Works for about 4 seconds then will not find the wire even if you touch it directly to the receiver. Went to return. 11 days past return period. Would be great it it worked properly.
3,"While it is a well made movie and there were parts I liked, over all it's not a movie I'd want to watch again.","One does get a feel for Israel from the movie and I did like certain parts, but over all the story just seemed a little too over the top. Still, I do like movies from this director. I'd say watch it if you have nothing much to do otherwise. But don't expect it to be an all-time favorite."
5,Favorite movie of Israelis,"This is a great movie showing many facets of being an Israeli, a Jew, young German, and how history impacts individuals. And it has a good ending. Well done on many levels. I'm very glad to own it."
4,A pleasant surprise,"Walk on Water has it all, action, emotion, drama. It's a movie that spans two continents and three languages. The first half is a little slow (introducing characters and dilemnas). The second half is the better half. A good movie about humans and how they act and change."
4,My Advice? Buy This Player!,"I recently reviewed the Panasonic RQ-SX67V. I was very disappointed with that cassette player! This one, however, which I found at the going out of business sale of Service Merchandise, is really very good and what I was looking for. Play a cassette, shake it hard, and not one skipped beat! I'm very pleased! The price listed on Amazon is what I paid at the sale, which I think is a good price...."
2,good picture.. poor quality dvd release.,"i have just purchased this disc believing it to be 16x9 1.85 aspect ratio,but it isn't.. its 2.35 4.3 and the picture quality is not good ,brownish colour and blury wide and longshots..close ups are okay. this is actually an above average western with some good star performances so if you really want to own this film you may consider it worth the money,but technology has progressed so far these days that its a pity we have to put up with movie releases that are little better than video quality albeit widescreen.then again what benefit is the widescreen if the picture is so small you can barely discern the contents?"
4,Itry to buy USA. Rick,It's not a Tonka that I bought for my sons 35 years ago but it is still sturdy enough just to leave outside for my Grandson & a fraction of the cost of a Tonka of this size.
5,Clear As A Bell,"I've had this product for over ten years. Right from the start I knew it was going to be a hit with me. Why? Because the recording quality was as clear as a bell. So many other recorders I'd tried, (whether boomboxes or cassette recorders) had lots of tape hiss and the voice sounded far away and music was unclear.The sound quality of this boombox is outstanding.And since I am an fmdx enthusiast I was impressed with the ability to pick up stations from far away.I've recommended this product to my friends, and now I'm recommending it to you. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,As It Should Be,Inspiring. Wish it was required reading for every coach. The book describes the world of sports as it should be........encouraging!
3,"Good message, but not my cup of reading tea","The overarching message of Season of Life is to have empathy for those around you. Success comes to those who put others first.I think this is a good message, I believe it, I teach my kids in this way and I actually make a modest attempt at living it. However, the downside to these types of books is the schmaltzy style in which they're typically written.Marx' style isn't notably different from ""typical"" in this case. The difference, I suppose, is that the book's context is (as an SI reviewer puts it) ""the most violent of American games."" The protagonists of this story would call that ""false masculinity""... oh, well."
5,Hits the spot for fathers,"Being a new father of a 10 month-old son, my mind often looks to the future to imagine how I will handle the questions, scenarios, and predicaments my son will face later in life--especially during those vital teenage years. This book, though nothing extravagant or nobel prize-type writing (it doesn't claim to be), is well written and held the interest of the father side of me the whole way through. There were 3 times that even I noticed tears in my eyes simply because I WANTED that to happen between my son and me. As goes the undertone of this book: I want my son to learn how to be a ""real man"", a man who respects women to the last straw, a man who puts relationships before self image and ego, and a man who lives his life for others. What a great and true book to instill those lessons. I even found myself doing exactly what the author did at the end of the book: plan a trip with just my brother, my dad, and me."
4,Hill & Tolliver reunite,"I listened to this new release about a week after listening to Dance with Death...they are quite different. Time lines has a very Ornette-ish vibe to it, with little bop and lots of rubato balladry. Tolliver's tone has darkened over the years, and he really says something every time he gets the chance. I must disagree with the reviewer who claimed Tardy was phoning it in--I find his playing to be really excellent here...it's nice to hear the bass clarinet played well."
3,could be more sturdy,"I bought this doll a few weeks ago at my local Toysrus store. When I showed it to my grandaughter she was so excited. We put the pieces together for her but everytime she would use the stroller it would fall apart. This playset is small, just the right size for a toddler."
2,Disappointing.,"Difficult to connect the pieces, and almost impossible to take apart without breaking it. The capsules were nice, but not worth it. SUPER DISAPPOINTING."
5,Bad Description/Region 1 vs PAL,Beware. I ordered this DVD for Region 1 as describe in the AMAZON site but gotPAL. A reordered delivered the same results. I will play on my MAC if I resetmy region. But would be nice the play on DVD large screen with good speakers.Who wants to sit 2 + hours in front of a computer to enjoy this.I have written to AMAZON customer service twice and they insist that the decriptionis Region 1. I suggested they notify their warehouse and they will not do that.So buyer beware on this one. Anyone else get PAL version when expection Reg.1??
5,Scarey Book,"Although this book is old, its worth the read for serious students of the Kennedy Assassination. Her underlying theme. I just spent several years pouring over the Warren Commissions Volumes of evidence and see a huge conspiracy, just wondered what you all were looking at?"
4,GREAT,Fits well and is comfortable. If the lens fogs up its because the strap behind your head is too loose.I finally figured that out. Now they don't fog up. Ps. Make sure to take out the front and back blue screen protectors. The one in back is harder to get off.
1,I would not buy this helmet if I knew then what I know now.,"The helmet is poorly made. I have a normal size head for a 5'10"" man and I find there is way to much pressure applied to the sides of my head. It gives me a headache after awhile and even with all of that pressue the helmet feels to loose for fast paced action.Also the foam around the nose pushes down and retricts the airflow going in and out of my nose. I have tried every adjustment imaginable but it is still uncomfortable.In addition the button snaps feel as though they barley snap on. It's a miracle that the plastic post snaps that hold the visor in place do not break when you disassemble the helmet to clean it.I don't understand how this helmet received so many positive reviews when it is such crap. It is my hope that this review will save someone from wasting time and money trying this helmet out."
4,A very good introduction to the Persians,"This book is part of the Time-Life series: Lost Civilizations. It examines Persian history and civilization from ancient Elam through the conquest by the Arabs in 642. The book has a wealth of information on its subject, along with a large number of beautiful and interesting pictures.My one complaint against this book is that it largely ignores the religious aspect, devoting only one small sidebar to Zoroastrianism. If you are interested in the ancient Persians, then this is an excellent book to own."
4,This is pure hard bop.,"This is as chewy as it gets. Joe Henderson does a lot of honking and squeaking here, but he smooths it out on most of his solos and Bobby Hutcherson chimes in nicely all over the place. If you're new to hard bop or Joe Henderson, start here."
1,Reese's 36 pc box,"Reese's box was banged up, torn, and missing the bottom...then taped back together. The bottom half of the product was damaged and inedible. I assume this damage occured from the seller as the shipping box was intact. Further, most of the product was melted. Will not buy again."
5,Outstanding...a must read for integration,This work has integrated my thought in a most helpful way. Highly recomended.
1,Worthless piece of junk,I bought this radio to listen to AM when I ride my bike. The station I like to listen to is less than 40 miles away. I get constant static and haveto play it as loud as possible to hear the voices. I have to keep it turnedjust right or the station fades. It may be all right if you live in a citywith a radio station you want to listen to but it is worthless out in thecountry. I remember when Panasonic was made in Japan.
1,Very poor,Very poor reception. Brings in only very strong nearby station. Couls not use. Just threw it in a drawer. A real piece of junk
2,"ITS ok, THE SONY ICF S10MK2 IS BETTER.","I PURCHASED THIS RADIO TO SEE JUST HOW IT COMPARED WITH THE SONY S10 MK2, I LIVE IN COLORADO AT A SHADE UNDER 10,000FT. ON THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE ROCKIES WITH NOTHING TO OBSTRUCT RADIO RECEPTION.I REALLY DON'T LISTEN TO FM THAT MUCH AND MY OPINION IS THE PANASONIC AND SONY ARE PRETTY MUCH EQUAL IN BOTH SOUND QUALITY AND RECEPTION. BUT, WHEN IT COMES TO AM RECEPTION THE PANASONIC DOESEN'T COMPARE, IT CAN BARELY PICK-UP THE LOCAL DENVER STATIONS, ON THE OTHER HAND THE SONY PICKS UP LOCAL STATIONS W/NO PROBLEM, AND ON A CLEAR NIGHT I'VE PICKED UP STATIONS AS FAR AWAY AS SAN ANTONIO.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE SONY, YOU WON'T BE SORRY."
4,Panasonic pocket,"After Hurricane irene left us without power for three days, I decided to get a pocket radio. I have enjoyed using it. FM stations come in wonderfully, but I occassionally have difficulty with AM reception."
5,Nice Basic Radio,"If you are looking for a small, portable basic AM/FM radio, you can't beat this. It has regular dial tuning, a fold out antenna, strap and most importantly clear reception on AM and FM channels. Nothing fancy at all about this little radio, but it works great and is definitely a great price!"
4,nice little radio,"this is like the little radio you had years ago when you were a teenager, before boomboxes where the thing. it has great reception and sound, we are actually using it hooked up to two tiny speakers we had, but it works great alone too."
4,good,"The book is great, but it was delivered to me and completely bent. Could have been prevented had a piece of cardboard been slipped in with the book."
1,don't know,"never received the item when it was promised, so guess I was duped, should have just gone to the store and bought one instead of using Amazon.com, as they are no help in resolving the issue"
2,Panasonic did not work,"Too bad the item did not work, but seller was very graciously handle the return and refund me. I have trouble find any Micro cassette recorder that works. I brought one from Radio Shack, a new one made by RCA, could not control playing speed. My second one brought from Staples brand name Panasonic did work again. So I thought if I brought a older model might work. Than I decide to look for a used one from Amazon. It turn out the battery compartment did not work one wire was missing.I had a happy ending, my daughter have two recorders, she give them to me."
5,BANDLER AT HIS BEST,"I'm a huge fan of Richard Bandler, a true guru for anyone wanting a grip on how to thrive in this world. As an NLP Trainer, I digest all this man does, and this is truly Bandler at his best. He's on target, on point, and on top of his game. Read this, now, and you'll be on top of your game, too."
3,Almost There,"I am a Lebanese-American who did NOT grow up speaking Arabic. I was so pleased to find Spoken Lebanese because I really wanted to be able to say a few words to my Lebanese friends. The contents of this book are excellent. There are so many wonderful expression in Arabic that we don't have in English ie. what to say to someone when they return home from a trip, expressions of sympathy or congratulations. The only problem is that the tape contains NO ENGLISH and the dialogs in the book are not translated line for line in English. This makes it impossible to listen to the tapes in the car and know what you are saying. I also had a hard time figuring out what the dialogs in the book were saying. I hope that Dr. Feghali will go back to the drawing board and add the necessary English components to create a first class book. Until then, mine just sits on the shelf."
2,Major Ripoff,"For the price they are asking, and the lack of extras, these collections are a major disappointment. Don't believe the packaging. These disks are far from being 'loaded with extras'. There are no extras on 3 of the disks, and the 4th has only a commentary track, and an 8 minute featurette about the restoration. Don't get me wrong, I love the films themselves, I just hate the way they have been packaged and sold. I mean they could easily have put 2 or even 3 of the films on one disk without any degradation, and issued the entire series in one collection for the price of a single one of these 'volumes'. I guess they are trying to recoup the cost of restoration. My advice, wait a couple of years for them to release the entire collection at a much lower price, because that is what they will have to eventually do."
2,Short on Practical Value,"I thought the author presented the science pretty well... Stem cells/DNA are programmed externally via the membrane, non-random evolution suggesting deliberate genetic mutations, EEGs that pick-up brain signals outside of the body , the placebo pill effect, etc.In short, he makes good arguments how environmental factors, both at the cellular level and by extension on the body as a whole, can indeed be responsible for one's present condition.Where I felt cheated, was the ending. It seems the whole book is leading to the climax that will explain what exactly one can do armed with this information. Unfortunately, it comes up short. Basically, he says positive affirmation and/or willpower aren't effective since they involve the conscious mind.. instead what is needed is to reprogram the unconscious. How do you do that? The book doesn't have any specifics."
3,Ok chalk holder,The chalk holder does not have a button to advance the chalk as a consequence the chalk is not easy to advance. I find this to be frustrating. Am I supposed to keep a dowl to ram down the hole that goes all the way through the holder to advance the chalk? Not what I expected and kind of a pain.
2,mistake,this product was for the wrong region so I couldn't enjoy it I made the mistake of not noticing what region this movie was from and so I didn't get to watch it as I would have liked
3,Not quite as advertised,"The female coupler is not brass as is shown in the pix... it's steel. Plus, it's the Old School-style quick-connect that requires the use of your other hand to manipulate the female connector to engage the male connector... it's not one of the modern one-handed (instant engage) female connectors in use nowadays."
3,No coupler with a female thread,"All 4 couplers you see have male thread. I bought a Campbell Hausfeld air chuck, and it came with male thread connector. My air hose also has a male connector. So there is no way to connect them. This quick connect kit would work if one of the connectors has a female thread so I can connect the air chuck to it. Because of that, I had to buy another kit made by another brand."
3,"GEORGE MICHAEL, ""YOU'VE CHANGED""","Basically, ""Century"" should be viewed as a pet project by George to showcase the man's greatest asset - his amazing voice. ""Roxanne"", for example, is a erotic rendition of the Police classic. I admire his decision to treat fans to a little something different. But ever since ""Listen Without Prejudice"", Michael has been too melodramatic in both his songwriting and demeanor. Hopefully, George Michael's songs from the NEXT century will recapture the former commercial and artistic success of this great pop tunesmith."
4,Songs From the Last Century,"It's nice to George Michael back, if he was ever truly away. Like most women my age, I loved him when he was part of Wham, and am glad to see that just as my musical tastes have broadened throughout the years, so have his. Though I enjoy them all, ""Secret Love"" is by far my favorite cut. Perhaps he could do another album in this style as his voice does great justice to this timeless music. Bravo George!"
2,what a waste of talent,"this Man can sing,write,&produce so why this run of the mill material? why the Brunch Music?i was wishing for more dance songs like Fast Love&outside.i know he can sing other peoples music.he has done a good job covering Stevie Wonder's songs.but i would have prefered a whole new album hopefully next time?"
2,Going down?,"Havig been a huge George Michl fan ever since his Wham days, and being a huge fan of old school songs. I awaited this CD with great anticipation.Unfortunately it all fell apart already the first time I heard the CD.This is not art, this is plain boring..."
4,George Michael?! This is too good to be...,"Having never been much of a fan of Wham, or, for that matter, of George Michael himself, I wasn't expecting much from this album that came to me as a gift. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I first listened to the gentle songs of this collection. No one who has listened to this album of mine believes it really is George Michael. You've got to listen for yourself!"
5,This is essential for anyone applying to graduate schools of social work!,This book helped me get accepted to a graduate school of clinical social work in the Northeast. (I only applied to one.). I highly recommend it to anyone applying to graduate schools of social work!
5,These very efficient exercises of,"Dynamic Tension, don't absorb your time.If you read this book, your exercise-time-figure problem will get solved PERMANENTLYYou don't have to spend your money in a Gym or jog around like crazy risking an assault or ""eating "" a great part of your time.Sit in your office,drive, work in the kitchen and you CAN DO THEM ALL THE TIME!The results are awesome !GREAT TECHNIC IN A GREAT BOOK !"
1,A wise man once said...,"You're still a slave, look at how you behaveDebatin' on where and when and how and what Massa gaveYou wanna know how we screwed up from the beginning?We accepted our opressor's religionSo in the case of slavery it ain't hardBecause it's right in the eyes of THEIR God"
3,I don't know much...,"but, i'd call this album surprising. KRS-One is obviously praising Jesus Christ, the Bible, and, for the most part, the god they represent. I thought KRS-one said these were an important piece of the puzzle of African enslavement. I thought KRS-One foresaw the higher level, the truly encompassing one, that even contained the books, ALL the books. Maybe i am just out of the loop; i am. But, i'm surprised; and, not afraid to say: somewhat disappointed that KRS-one has lowered himself to sacred books of the Age of Pisces. I thought we were moving forward, to the Temple of Hip-Hop, and all the cultures and beliefs it is blended with, it has blended... KRS-One, where are You?"
1,stupid sophomoric moronic juvenile childish boring facile,"This cd bites the big one and gags on it. The humor (if that is what it is supposed to be) is non-existent. A bunch of 7th graders with a tape recorder would be funnier. A SNL sketch is funnier. These people believe humor comes from jokes about bodily functions and screaming the F word as often as possible. There is no content, no social relevance and no jokes. I bought it and now would not even use it as a coaster for fear people would know I actually spent money on it. Uproar,the label for this cd is a very reliable outfit in terms of comedy, except this one time. I know this from my 250 + comedy cd collection. stay away from this, even in a bargain bin."
2,Kind of funny but only worth one listen,"Read the GLOWING reviews on Amazon, and thought that this would be a total yukfest. Honestly, there are some laughs here and there and even some unique concepts. But, in general, I've heard most of this material elsewhere before, and I think the execution was pretty half-assed.So, I'd say it's sort of funny. But I doubt I'll listen to it twice."
5,great CD,"great CD, I like all Hags music. good these songs were remastered- will probably by some of the other CD's that were also remastered"
4,The Hag,"I was very pleased with the CD and enjoyed hearing some of the old songs again. I bought it because I have a friend that needed the words to ""Jesus Take Ahold"" as he is thinking of putting it on his next CD. I might have to get another one since he now has it."
2,A good short story spoiled,"I bought this book because I am a fan of the War Nerd. I was disappointed.The basic idea of a Californian nerd's autobiography is promising enough, and Dolan has plenty of horribly embarrassing material (girls, personal hygiene, and work). Unfortunately, without the discipline of a word limit, or a decent editor, it degenerates into pure introspective self indulgence. Six pages on a fantasy, not even about the girl of his desire, but about his attempts to summon magical help to take the girl of his desire.There are still some jewels amid the dross, but be prepared to skim."
4,I don't think it's going to last,"I love the look of my Sky Blue Abbey nubuck cover, but the nubuck is getting awfully dirty and I've only had it a few months. It's starting to get black in the clasp area where it gets touched a lot. However, the hard plastic insert that the Visor snaps into really protects it. I just think it's going to look so ugly in a few months I'll have to buy a new one."
3,I love TV commercials,"I bought this CD because I like Galvanize-the Budweiser song. For some reason, this song just makes me smile. It has a good beat, etc, etc...I give it ""82"". the rest of the CD is good to, has good beats. I like it and I do listen to the entire thing, not just the song I like most."
3,CRUSHED BY COMMERCIALIZATION,"hopefully I can save some folks here from making the same mistake that I did, running out to buy this record in hopes that there was no way in the world that the chems would make another ""come with us"". (they came close - it's better - a little more focused & better produced)I won't break down ""push the button"" track by track or get into great detail like a lot of these reviewers - & make sure you do in fact read these reviews, because I didn't. if I did, I sure as hell would've spent my $13 elsewhere.I rated 3 stars because it may not be horrible, but it surely ain't like the good old boys, & is flat-out not for me.VOCALS, VOCALS, & MORE VOCALS!to sum it up, if yer looking for song to siren, 3 little birdies, chemical beats, music: response, under the influence, sunshine underground, hey boy hey girl, lops of fury, dig your own hole, setting sun, it doesn't matter, the private psychadelic reel, et al..... or anything remotely close.....you won't find it here."
1,WARNING CD IS COPY CONTROLLED ***BOYCOTT & DON'T BUY,THIS CD COMES WITH THAT NEW COPY CONTROLLED TECHNOLOGY WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO PLAY THE CD IN MY WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER. HENCH YOU CAN NOT LISTEN TO ANYTHING BUT THIS CD IN ONE SITTING USING SOME PLAYER THAT COMES WITH THE CD. IF YOU WANT TO MIX THESE SONGS IN WITH YOUR OTHER MUSIC FORGET IT. DO NOT BUY ANY CDS THAT SUPPORT THIS TECHNOLOGY.
2,dissapointing,"I was expecting something different. Compared to Come with Us, this album is mediocre. There are a couple of decent tracks, but nothing stands out. If you are a breakbeat fanatic you might dig this album, if not you will probably be dissapointed. This is definately a burn not buy cd."
4,Most laid back,"I have been a Chemical Brothers fan since their Dig your Hole and I have all their albums and this in my opinion is their most laid back work ever. I applaud them for creating a very different kind of album, there is almost no big beat type of music but more of a chill out kind a music to relax to. A couple of their songs in the beginning are good but feels just kind of there, but it is near the end, songs number 10 and number 11 really kicks some serious ass! Thank you to the Chemical Brothers for keeping music refreshing in a world of stale pop and rock caca."
1,Where is the warning label for Copy Control Disc?,"How would I rate this album? I can't tell because I can't listen to it.Copy Control technology -- look it up on the net -- they can not even technically call this a Compact Disc as it does not adhere to the format standards. I think Amazon.ca should be required to notify people that the album they are selling features this technology and will not play on your computer (without adding their software), nor can you get it onto your ipod.Letters to EMI have gone unanswered so this is how I will show my displeasure -- I will not buy another EMI Canada disc so long as they use this technology. I'd rather eat the import premiums than give them another penny. Coldplay, Ben Harper, Chemical Bros"
2,disappointing for home use,"I guess these headphones may be good for portables but I bought them for home (stereo, computer) use and am disappointed.My main complaints are: (1) the cord is short! It's only about 4 feet, nowhere near 8 feet described here, and (2) they aren't very comfortable so far. Too tight on my big head and it makes my ears warm.Also not mentioned is the function of the little box inline with the cord. It is a filter to let you play with 3D effects and ""move the sound around inside your head"". It's an interesting gimmick, but I'd rather have a longer cord."
2,dissapointed with Green,"Bookends was definitely not one of Green's better books. I previously have read Jemima J and Mr. Maybe, but Bookends seemed to be too serious of nature with no exact plot. Maybe I wanted just a light-hearted book and it was the wrong time to read Green's novel, but her topic choice was boring for me. I never was truly engrossed in the novel. The book, like all of hers, was predictable but I also was not very intrigued by any of the characters. I felt some of their emotions but most of the time I never really cared what they were going to do next. I was very dissapointed with Green because I don't think it was one of her better efforts.If you're thinking of reading one of Jane Green's novels, I would suggest Jemima J before picking up Bookends."
3,"Good, but could have been better","I am a big fan of Jane Green and I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I was a bit disappointed. It just wasn't what I thought it would be. I love Jemima J and Mr. Maybe, but this was a bit different.It was still a good story and I would recommend it."
3,Not Jane's Best Work,"I loved Jemima J and Mr. Maybe, but Bookends was not as good as either of them. It was good, but not Jane's best. Too many characters lives covered and if you are into love stories, this is not the best love story and the character barely has one. Not much covered on that topic. This is mainly about a group of friends and the interaction between them."
2,Not Green's Best,"This novel is not what Jane Green normally produces. There was so much going on with the main character, Cath, and her friends that you never get to know her. There's way too much to the plot and not enough depth to cover it sufficiently. I was annoyed by the end of the book and flipping just to get to the all-too-predictable end."
2,"Starts Fun, But Gets Preachy","As a fan of Jane Green's inital novels, I expected Bookends to be yet another lighthearted, side-splitting read. However, as I waded through the fairly shallow plot, I became more and more dissatisfied, as if I could feel there was a better/ more interesting and captivating story that could be told.Then suddenly, approximately three-quarters of the way through, almost an entire chapter was made to feel like a propoganda pamphlet. I wasn't sure if I was reading a piece of literature from one of my favorite authors, or a weepy, overemotional brochure that could be picked up in any medical clinic. The original, albeit weak, plot was lost, and I was left feeling slightly chastened.All in all, Bookends was interesting, but nothing to go out of your way to read. The last quarter is preachy, and the plot gets lost. Mediocre and disappointing."
3,great story...but then...,I enjoyed this book for the most part until I was two-thirds of the way done. It suddendly turned into a book about something completely different than I expected. I felt like I read two different books. What happened towards the end became such a major part of the book that everything else was forgotten about.I would have liked to have seen Cath's relationship with James explored more and to have heard more of the daily life of the bookstore.The storyline that came out of the blue is the main reason for 3 rating.
2,A Tad Bit Boring to be put in the Bridget Jones genre,"I really wanted to like this book. I tried to get into it, but Green's characters weren't developed enough to keep my interest.Read Last Chance Saloon by Marian Keyes instead. Seems like the same storyline, but so much better!"
1,Boring,"Sorry, I tried but this books just did not do it for me. Took it on a plane thinking I'd be all good for a long 12 hour flight. Not. I like Jane Green so expected a good read. Not her best... Did not finish it... Life is too short."
4,Better than the first Jane Green book I read,"Cath,Si,Josh and Portia were first at University until then there was a falling out and Portia left the group. A few year later, Cath is working at job that she no longers likes. Spirited on by Josh's wife Lucy, Cath decides to open her own bookstore. Along with this life changing event, Portia is back in the group, but what are her motives?I have admit that the first book that I read by Jane Green ""Jemima J"" I could not stand. But I have to say that I did really like ""Bookends."" Ms. Green gave her characters real emotions. The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is that the HIV story line should have been brought earlier in the book."
5,I love it!,"I like Bookends more than Jemima J. Both are good; Bookends is just more realistic. If Jemima J. is a fairy tale, Bookends is a real world. Everybody in Bookends is believable. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole book. Jane Green always does a very good job when compose a story. Well, actually, I wish she could write more about beautiful Portia. Portia has disappeared in Cath's life for 10 years. After she came back, I was eager to find out what happened in her past and current life. But Jane Green wrote too much about Cath. This is a bit disapponting for me. After I finished the last page of the book, I feel I haven't read enought about Portia. Why she became a lesbian; why she hangs out with Josh in a restaurant without notifying other friends, what they were doing there. Just every other character's life is clear to readers, Portia remain ambiguous to me."
3,Lain possibly a pain,"This is a good buy if you love anime, however, the plot is VERY slow in progressing and by the end of the series (Lain: Reset) most questions are not answered. If you're into Chris Carter-esque plots (ie X-files), or love anime, it is a good buy, but most people will give up by the 2nd DVD."
3,well.......,"This series is for serious anime fans, and people capable of deep thought... i mean deep thought.. ( unlike myself ) This series has similar ideas and thoughts similar to that of the last episode of evangelion. If you did not like the last episode of eva, then you might not like this series. The animation is superb, but the story line is not appealing to everyone, watching it a few times might help also.. overall.. not bad.. but not that great either.."
5,love it,"Lain is a mind show. I like it for many reasons. I like everyone who likes anime should see this movie. well enjoy. And the music is really good.""Why? Why won't you come?"" The Beging of lain"
1,Confusing,I thought that it was very confusing and hard to follow. Someone else may get it but I didn't.
4,Very intriguing start to a mystery.,"Based on the first four episodes on ""Navi"", this looks like it will be a very interesting cyber ghost story, with mysterious forces lurking in the background. I'm hooked, and can't wait to see more. The first installment is quietly and deliberately paced, with more mood than action (fans of action anime might find it boring.) I hope the rest of the story lives up to this beginning."
2,Quite dull,"When I rented the 1963 ""Lord of the Flies"" movie on VHS, I expected to see a gripping, thrilling tale, dramatic, and disturbing. But what do I see? A bunch of clean, orderly looking boys with their hair neatly combed saying their scripted lines with absolutely no feeling or enthusiasm. The film doesn't even explain what the ""lord of the flies"" actually is. (If you want to find out what the lord of the flies is, read the book). If I had watched the movie without having read the book, I would have thought it was a great movie, and that the book couldn't be too much better. But instead, I sat through the whole 90 minutes, recalling parts of the book that were left out or changed in favor of something much more boring or unrealistic.My advice...read the book, and don't waste your time with this movie, it's horrible.Thank goodness I only rented it."
5,Fly No Further,"If you are looking for the definitive theatrical version of ""Lord of the Flies"", here it is. All essential thematic elements are included without laboring over miscellaneous detail. Sure, it could be longer to include every detail from the novel, but it loses nothing at its current length. I found it very useful as a follow up to classroom study, and my students adjusted well to the black and white presentation. You know it hits the mark when you need to pass out Kleenex, after Simon and Piggy's deaths, to a jaded bunch of ninth graders. Worth the investment!!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST SCREENPLAYS OF THE 60s,"Billy wilder was the first woody allenand this movie shows itthe best comedy and drama with great performances and direction.a treasure, no doubt about it"
4,Very Nice,"The Apartment is a charming movie. It's full of laughs and even tears. It is confusing though. Why do people want Lemmon's apartment? This is a wonderful movie, despite its confusing plot."
1,OH NO....NOT COLORIZATION AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!,"Shame on you MGM. If directer Billy Wilder wanted this film in color, HE WOULD HAVE SHOT IT IN COLOR. Who are you to change his vision ? Remember, one of the many awards this film won was for Best Photography, BEST BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY. And Best Art Direction, BLACK AND WHITE ART DIRECTION ! You would do best to buy the black and white print. STAY AWAY FROM ""COLORIZED"" prints. This is an insult to one of Hollywood's greatest directors. What next, a color print of ""Some Like It Hot, or ""Sunset Blvd"". SHAME ON YOU MGM!!!!!!!!"
2,GREAT game + crappy camera = frustrating experience,"What a great game. I have been an NG fan since the beginning. I couldn't wait for Sigma to come out. To my disappointment, Tecmo created a great game but ruined it with the worst camera view I have ever experienced. I am getting ambushed by three dragons coming at me from the front and the camera ""intelligently"" decides the object I need to focus on is the wall behind me. Nothing will tick you off more than dying because you couldn't see what was right in front of you. Maybe for the next NG game, Tecmo could make it more challenging by blacking the screen totally out every time you encounter bad guys."
4,Fun!,"Overall, pretty satisfied with this game. It's very fun and the controls are easy to use. I must say though it is an overall difficult game even at the normal mode. The graphics is great and I like the variety of weapons and character development."
4,Str8 Game....,I think its a decent game great graphics...i would suggest it 2 any n.g. fan....R.$.G.
1,dont waste your many,"On the back of the box to Sigma it reads ""The real reason you bought a PS3""I think not...Let's start off with the beginning scene, where a ninja jumps out and comes at another ninja, both of them look basically the same; and your ninja needs to defend himself and kill the other ninja. How you ask? Who the hell knows the game starts off without telling you much.The game play is pathetic; controls are iffy, 'combos' are weird to execute.Graphics wise, the game isn't half bad, but if you look at the biceps of the first boss, you think you're playing on the PSX or something.Enemy AI ....what's that? Cause I don't think it was incorporated at all. The enemies just mindlessly swing at you really, all of which are easily dispatched.Overall in my opinion this game stinks....if you're an old fan, then I guess you'll like it, I'll stick to old school Ninja Gaiden myself.."
4,Great game but next to impossible,"The graphics and gameplay are fantastic! This game offers no setting as far as difficulty and is so challenging It can be annoying. I think that this game offers a lot of hours of fun however, and if you are a fan of the series it is a must have!"
4,A real ninja,"This game have a good graphics interface and a smooth movment.The level of this game comes harder until the end of the game.It winderful game,buy it ,its worth."
3,Its Not That Bad,"For all of you No Limit fans out there, this cd just might get you listening to the tank again. It has a few new faces representing on the album. Overall it is a decent album. And to the fool that wrote the ""garbage"" reveiw, he must be the most ignorant cat out there."
3,Wobble Wobble,"This isn't one of the better no limit albums but it holds its ground. To me the best album that they have put out to date is Ice Cream Man. Right now I want to take a few moments to school a few people about southern rappers. Southern rap didn't begin with No limit OR Cash Money (who did't came out until the mid-90's. Way before either of them came around the were groups like Outkast, UGK, Eightball and MJG, 3-6 Mafia and Too Live Crew just to name a few. Those are the pioneers of the Southern sound. It wasn't until No Limit and Cash Money did peeps outside the south started listen to southern music. And if you want the truth No limit DID start saying hot boys first and whoadi didn't start with either of them. I can feel you on the Tupac thing though but he is far from being like Fluff Daddy. All in all the album is aight if you are a die hard no limit fan then you will really like this one."
5,No limit wont ever fall off,"You cant say that u dont like no limit cuz if you listen to them they are tight. I have been a fan for it seems like forever. I dont see how anyone can diss them. Every song on this cd is tight. The best songs are I can tell, wobble wobble, whodi, D-game, Souljas, Roll Roll, Big toys, we bust, beefin, check em, and preety much every other song on this album. The tank dont stop."
1,CRAP,"Master P and all of no limit have no skill and just utter senceless words to make $$. Typical lazy, wanna be Dre rapper. No Limit will never be main stream and this is why cuz all they sing about is stupid things that make no sence and have no meaning to anyone. Save yourself the $ and go get Nelly's new LP."
2,"The message is good, but it's the same book(s) re-written.","Don't get me wrong, I think Neale's got a good message. I think everyone ought to read his first 3 CWG books. BUT, I don't think this book was really necessary. He's said it all already. Here, he plays dumb, asking God questions and receiving the answers like these ideas are all new to him and he hasn't written five or six books previously devoted to bringing this same message. Oh, don't forget the audio tapes, study guides, meditation cards, etc. Okay, maybe he uses a few different words and phrases and applies them to current events. But he's saying the SAME THING. Makes me wonder if all he's concerned about now is keeping the CWG ""franchise"" alive in the eyes of the buying public. How many more books can he write without saying anything new??? Stay tuned...."
3,"good, but mainly repetition of things already said","Like Walsh's previous book, this book starts off promising, but then starts to repeat the same basic ideas that were presented in hid other books. Overall enjoyable, but not as interesting as Will Shad's Conversations With God books. Walsch has the right idea about how to deal with the terrorism, and if we can apply some of what he presents then the world can be a better place/"
3,Hinduism updated for Americans,"After reading various works from Hinduism, I find this book a rather bold attempt at americanizing them. The author does write in upbeat fashion and his material seems clear and it does hit the metaphysical upper levels about mid way into the writings. I would guess to most Americans the material would appear new and unique. However, a rose by other name is still a rose. New cover but same old theology."
2,Too many gaps,"I did learn some from these lessons, but I found that there were too many gaps to make it really useful. We do learn to establish if the person with whom we are speaking speaks English and/or Polish, but we do not learn how to become acquainted. It would be useful to know how to make acquaintances through questions like ""What is your name?"" We only learn formal forms of address. Another gripe that I have is that the pronunciation is not consistent. There is too much of an emphasis on translation from English into Polish and not enough on trying to think in the language. Yes when we are learning our native language as children we learn to speak before we learn the grammar, but we are immersed in the language. Yes, this course is easy, but we do not really learn to communicate."
1,The Science Code,"I bought the Genesis Code hoping to find a good family video. I was so disappointed. The premise is flawed from the very start. The young college students attempt to justify evolution by manipulating the integrity of what God meant when He created the world. They leave out some very important issues that make their approach impossible. For example, Biblically, there was no death until sin entered the world by Adam and Eve's disobedience. This video begins with a presupposition that evolution is true and Christians need to find a way to justify the Bible. Christians need to start with the Bible and wait for science to catch up. I would not recommend this video, I wish I could return it."
3,"Feels good, looks good, but quality problems","This series of Visor cases seems quite nice. The visor locks in place solidly, the leather is good looking, and the unit appears well made.But two weeks after I got the case, the snap came apart. To Amazon's credit, they sent an immediate replacement. But the replacement's strap was just short enough to make the male and female snap pieces not meet easily.I'm going to keep the case anyway and see what happens. But my experience points to some quality control issues at Handspring manufacturing.--dave"
5,I Found the Magic,"I always question why someone would launch a personal attack on Dr. Dave instead of discussing the book. I seriously doubt if they have read the book and are simply throwing mud. Dr. Dave and Dr. Sharon are good people whom I respect. I have read the book and it is an excellent help for understanding how to make changes within my life. It addressed many issues that were stumbling blocks, but after applying the techneques in the book, the stumbling blocks were removed and I found the resolution I was seeking. I would recommend the book to anyone going through a transition and who feel trapped in their rut."
5,Great Quality,"This mp3 album is great quality and was very easy to download and burn to cd. Also, the music is great."
1,Look out for antonline_com shipping costs!,"If you are considering purchasing these DVD+R's through the Amazon seller called ""antonline_com"" (which was the only choice at the time of this writing) then make sure you check the S&H; charges first.Antonline charges 6.99 per shipment PLUS 0.99 per pound!!!"
4,"""Loner"" does not mean ""psychopath""","This is book is really just a series of observations about what it's like to live ""out of the box,"" so to speak. Our culture is based on extraverts who constantly need entertainment and group membership, so the ""loners"" are not understood. They're suspected to be weird, eccentric, mentally ill, child predators, or serial killers. It's very interesting, and encouraging to those of us who sometimes (or often) find it necessary to shun all human contact in order to find our center. Message: being a loner is nothing to be ashamed of."
3,"Entertaining, conflicted","""PoO:tLM"" is an entertaining read, but suffers from an inevitably conflicted voice. Rufus describes repetitively the audience as being an ""us"" and a ""we"", yet makes a distinct point of denying such titles. It's a book about a group of people that is not a group. One can chalk this up to simply being a paradox, but it occasionally distracts the reader.It's littered with historical, cultural and personal illustrations of her arguement: that being a ""loner"" is a good thing in spite of it's stigma. Though it's not the best read, it's insightful and unique. Definitely worth the 10 or so dollars Amazon is charging."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this book with a sense of excitement. I had hoped to uncover some of the mystery regarding this young woman. The details were few and far between. There was little emphasis on religion or early medicine As I was reading I was never able to ""see"" the brightly colored Celtic garments, or ""smell"" the Celtic campfires or ""hear"" the rumbling of the chariot wheels. There was too much emphasis on the passions betwixt and between the various characters. The author tried to cover too many characters stories and lost his story in the process. A good book maybe for the junior hign school level reader."
3,it happens again,"it is an interesting read, u will feel as if history is repeating itself today...let's hope not..."
3,Ronald Reagan Pop Up Book,"Generally, this was a very fair, well written history of the Great Depression. While the author treats both Hoover and FDR in an even, balanced manner, the same cannot be said of Ronald Reagan. Perhaps, as some other reviewers have noted, McElvaine was attempting to put the era into some historical context, but too often it comes across that the author just can't stand the 40th President. Too bad, since throughout the book Reagan pops up without warning and usually without warrant. This sort of intrusion does little to recommend the author."
2,"Yes, Extremely Biased Book","To all commentators who are trying to justify the biasness of this book, you should be ashamed.This book has a MAJOR tilt to the left in terms of how it looks at not only economics, but history.The Reagan bashing is childish and arrogant and the anti-capitalist economic theories are very one-sided, yet disguised as intelligent because it is thorough and detailed.The economic growth of the 80's and 90's and the higher standards of living and worker gains in those era's hopefully will, or should have made this book completely irrelevant."
3,"Hey come on, it's still kinda... Royksopp!","OK, it's no Melody AM, not even close, but it's different. A weird mix of this and that, but all in all a bit more poppy, vocal, and accessible than his Melody AM.Honestly this reminds me a lot of Air's ""The Virgin Suicides"".I think I miss the DJ-esque treatment of audio on his previous album--this all sounds a little too polished and fancy schmancy. He had a nice ""style"" in his earlier release--I hope to get a taste of that again from his next album!But still very listenable!"
3,Not as good as Melody AM,"I was so happy with ""Melody AM"" that I also bought ""the Understanding."" Too bad. Melody AM is so much better than the Understanding that the CDs sound like they were made by different groups altogether. This CD just did not have any life to it. Kind of blah."
3,Cannot get 1080P to work,"I have not been able ot make this unit work on 1080P resoluiton, highest setting it allows is 1080i. If I try to seet it to 1080P, it defaults to 480P. I ma very disappointed.I have a 1080P LCD TV that I recently purchased. I was using Sony 1080i upconverting DVD player with it and could switch from 720 P to 1080i - no problem. I just could not resist ordering a 1080P DVD upconverting box, and now it is turning out to be ""a bird in hand is better than two in bush"" story.Called Samsung product support and they simply refuse to acknowledge that there is any problem with this unit. Their analysis is that my TV does not support 1080P. At the same time, they have no clue why I cannot set this HD960 unit to 720P, while Sony DVD player I still have, has no problem playing at 720P with the same TV.Issue has been escalated to their T-2 level and lets hope they have a solution."
3,What is up-conversion?,I am really not sure if this so-called up-conversion really works! I am not convinced at this point by this DVD player!
1,Not Happy:(,I received two HD960 DVD players from Amazon. Both failed to work properly with the HDMI cable. Both players would run for awhile then every 5 minutes it would loose sound and picture for a split second. Very annoying. Amazon was excellent at accepting them back even when i had thrown out the last box. If your not using HDMI this player is great. I have a 1080P TV so i want that clarity using the proper cable but not spending a fortune on an HD player. I bought the OPPO DVD player and that works awesome. Amazon sells that one. I got impatient and went to OPPO and bought it from them. Spent more money but o well.
1,Purchased For Slide Show Capabilities,"I purchased this player after being consulted by a Samsung representative and after purchasing/trying the model beneath this one. I needed the player to rotate pictures that I created in Photoshop at the native resolution of my HDTV for a store front display. The Samsung representative assured me that this model would display the JPEG pictures in high definition. It didn't. The player downscaled the pics to a lower resolution that didn't fill the screen and made them too fuzzy to read or it wouldn't read the cd at all. After trying 5 different DVD players that said they would rotate pics (to make it simple) I gave up. Each had their own problem...no time between pic adjustments, goofy transitions, etc. For rotating pictures you are better off with an old computer and running Google's Picasa slideshow program. That's how I ended up making it work. Just make sure your HDTV has a DVI or VGA input."
5,I have a big pair,"I have a 61"" Samsung 6187HDTV and I purchased the HD960 to watch my normal DVDs on. After reading all 40+ reviews I am expecting this player to plug into my TV with the provided cable and be watching pretty dang good but not quite HDTV with it.I will update after delivery.FWIW I have thought that my regular DVDs looked pretty good using an old non-progressive DVD player. I am not expecting HD quality, but I am expecting to see a positive difference going from good to wow!Update: works as advertised. Not all DVDs apprear better, but the ones that do really look better."
2,"Incomplete, damaged, used","I received this item missing 2 of the brushes, one broken, a slightly crushed case, and the product appear to have been used. The shipping packaging was fine. I began the process of return for replacement, which was not offered, only a refund. Problem is the refund amount is only two thirds of the purchase price after shipping, even less with UPS pickup. I'm keeping the item as it was intended for a gift, but I will have to try finding replacement brushes at the craft store. So much for internet convenience. If it was complete, it would be a nice little gift for a young person new to sumi e."
2,brushes,I send one back because brushes were broken. Brushes are broken on the second set also. Did not want to deal with sending it back again.
3,Before You Buy . . . .,"I wish some reviews of this album had appeared here before I bought the CD. I probably would have chosen something else.This is solo piano. The arrangements are different from the run-of-the-mill sacred choices currently available, and are quite interesting. So far, so good.The pianist is competent. But the engineering of the recording . . . oh dear! I think there was one microphone somewhere in the room, possibly too near the pedals. Some very odd effects were achieved, either by oddball pedaling, poor recording, or a combination of both. In short, a very low budget recording session has spoiled what could have been a worthy contribution to the needed diversity in the sacred repertoire.If you are purchasing the album because you want to hear the arrangements, and might be thinking of performing them, this CD might be of some interest to you. But for general listening, I'd get something else."
5,Great Reference Book,"If you need a quick, comprehensive marine fish reference book this is the one to get. It is small enough to bring with you to the fish store and get a quick rundown on behaviors, ease of keeping, etc.If you ask the fish store about a fish, they are probably looking in this book for the answer."
1,Cheap material. Fell apart 1st week,I wish I would've read the reviews before buying this costume. It is made of extremely cheap material and I have had to sew it already in the 1st week. It is made for a child to only wear once. Definitely not worth the price I paid for it. I wish I would have just bought material and made my own.
4,good and bad,there was a good and bad side to this item. the good side was that it came faster than i thought it would. the bad side was that it didn't have the same mask as shown in the picture. the mask that was sent w/ it was actually quite crappy. so i just ended up painting my son's face instead.
2,Not So Great,"First off you can buy this cheaper at Walmart! Save yourself some money, because the costume is cheap. The mask is too small. The costume really is not something that is going to last, so if you want it to be more then just Halloween night you might not want to consider this costume. We bought it this morning and the costume already has runs in it."
3,Needs Gloves,"My nephew is having a blast wearing this - he loves to dress up as a firefighter, Batman, & now Spiderman! I did think it was overpriced though!!!"
1,spider man costume for toddler,He wore the costume twice and it has a hole under the arm and a hole in the crotch. Very cheaply made
4,good,My son loved it it is good quality is just ok kind of thin but good color mask ripped easy but serve the purpose
2,They are very responsible,"I just want to recommend them. They are very serious, responsible, and punctual. I bought a wrong product, and they apologize with me and return all my money.In the future, I will use them."
1,Guaranteed to Rip on Your 1st day of play,"Yelp, I guarantee this costume will rip on the 1st day of play. It is really cheaply made. It's the same cheap costumes that you find in walmart for 7-10 bucks. And I had to cut out a nose and mouth it doesn't give them a place to breath out of . YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR so don't pay over 10 bucks for this temporary costume"
3,better the first time around,"i read ""cubegirl"" and ""cubiclegirl"" on the internet. the novel is mostly a rerun of the material that was already on the net, complete with. requisite. periods. if you like reruns on TV, and you've read her stuff on the net before this book, then you'll like the book. it's like that second piece of chocolate cake. or third. or fourth. after awhile, you get a tummy ache."
2,alright,"this is an alright album not that good compared to his last one or the classic resonable doubt.this album gets mad boring after a couple of listens and the only song worth listening to over and over is ""so ghetto""by premier other than that it is pretty plain.dont waste your money on this wait for the next album."
1,I REGRET BUYING THIS TROPICAL LIFE CD !,"JAY-Z IS A PHONY.HE COPIES MAKAVELI IN MUSIC VIDEOS ,QUOTES,ECT.THE ON LY GOOD THING IN THIS ALBUM IS THE TRACK FEATURING DRE,THAT CUT IS ILL."
4,"S.Carter, u must try harder!","Being a long time admirer of Jay-z, I must say this isn't his best work. However, the songs do have tight beats and catchy phrases. I am disappointed that though his flow is tight, he raps about the same things (money, women, platinum) in almost every song! After a while, you just can't listen to it anymore. For true hip-hop fans feelin' Jigga, I recommend his first album, Reasonable Doubt."
3,not all that ghetto,"this is a good cd, if for no other reason than ""so ghetto."" that track is inspired. premier AND great lyrics. damn. the biggest problem with this cd is amil, the girl who jay z is always putting on. she literally ruins songs. when he gets rid of her, and gets premier on every track, i'll give him a 5. buy it though, it's dope."
1,Damn!,"I can't believe I even wasted my money to buy this cd. It was horrible, all of Jay-Z's previous cd's were off the hook but this one was a disgrace by far."
3,"Vol.3 - The Life And Times Of S. Carter ""The Paper Stash""","After the previous year's successful album ""Vol. 2, The Hard Knock Life"", Jay-Z gives us ""Vol. 3: The Life And Times of S. Carter"" by sticking to his guns and showing us why he's got more money, more cash, more jewelery and more women. The Jigga man may have fallen off lyrically with this one, but there plenty of gems to make you nod your head when the beat drops. Not his best efforts, but then again where are you going to find any better in this era."
2,Tears In My Eyes,"What's up wit ""Vol. 3"". ""Vol. 2"" was OK but I love ""Vol. 1"", ""The Dynasty"", and ""Reasonable Doubt"" but this record was below Jay-Z's level. He's a great rapper but this was definately not a great album.The ""Hova Song"" intro was good and I liked ""So Ghetto"" and ""Do It Again"" but ""Dope Man"" was just a filler track. I like ""Things That You Do"" with Mariah Carey but ""It's Hot"", ""Snoopy Track"", ""S. Carter"", ""Pop 4 Roc"", and ""Watch Me"" were more filler tracks. ""Big Pimpin"" with UGK was great and so was ""There's Been A Murder"" but ""Come And Get Me"", ""Nymp"", and the ""Hova Song"" outro were more fillers. The bonus tracks ""Anything"" and ""Jigga My Nigga"" were great though.I would buy the other Jay-Z albums but leave ""Vol. 3"" alone."
4,He did it again? haters no like,This Album solidifies Jay-Z as the premier rapper in the east coast. Almost everything is right in this album from his flows to his beats. The only thing I have a problem with is his lyrics have very little substance compared to his Reasonable doubt album. overall this is a must have album for any Jay-Z fan... If you don't have blueprint get that album first. Jay-Z is flawless on that album
4,it's ok,"i didnt but the album yet, but i know a few people who did..they say that's o.k..i was at first real anxious to run out and get it, but to me, vol 2 was better..i will pick it up, though, when i go to buy my d'angelo tomorrow..after all, it is a must have..."
1,Not dat impressive,Well ya c dis album has sum only 2 tight songs. One is Snoopy Track cuz of Juve's tight flow. The other tight song is Watch Me cuz Dr. Dre is tha illest mc eva. Neway why duz jayz try to help dese weak rappaz like beanie sigel and memphis bleek sell albums. Both of dem r sum of da saddest in da business. Amil is da only aight rappa Jigga promotes and she flows in S.Carter which is da 3rd best song on da c.d. Big Pimpin' sounds better on da radio cuz it cutz out sum of U.G.K's boring partz. Da bonus tracks r ill. Girl's Best Friend is one of da tightest song Jigga has ever produced. Overall dis c.d. is pretty bad cuz jay-z is just not real enough.
3,Jigga's Worst,"Vol. 3, Jay-Z's worst. After releasing a classic and two solid albums, there is a bad note. Here is where Jay-Z is extremely commercialized with songs like ""So Ghetto"" and ""Big Pimpin"", featuring UGK (average Texas rappers, Pimp C and Bun B). There are good songs like ""Watch Me"" featuring Dr. Dre, and ""Things That U Do"", featuring Mariah Carey.I reccomend The Life and Times of S. Carter to any fan of current rap, Juelz Santana and Twista."
3,Not much good,Jay Z makes too many albums. He is an excellent rapper but doesn't often make excellent songs. Big Pimping is a superb song. A few of the others are okay. The rest are rubbish.
3,"4x platinum: Give me a break!!!! Good spots, but mediocore","Yo, this cd is alright. I'm a Jay-z fan but this is not far from garbage. The great songs like There's been a Murder, Snoopy Track, and Come and Get Me make the album worth buying. So Ghetto, Dope Man, Do it again, and It's Hot are good. Big Pimpin and Watch Me are ok, and the rest of the songs are garbage. Not enough support from the rest of the Roc contributes to the mediocraty of the album. Not comparable the the two albums it's wedged in between of. I haven't heard his first two so I can't make a comparison there. Jay-z fans will like this at least to some extent."
1,Plain-Z!,"I bought Jay-Z's ""Vol. 3"" in January 2001, and after awhile I was utterly speechless on how PLAIN this album was! Three things wrong: He doesn't change the speed of his raps in any of the songs, and it seems as if all of his raps are on the same thing, and he has no interludes or skits to try and mix up the album up a bit! I think Jay-Z just wasn't at his best with this album.Don't get me wrong, I liked such Jay-Z songs such as ""Can I Get A..."", ""Anything"", and ""I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)"". If you buy a Jay-Z album, I suggest buying ""Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life""!"
4,More Like 3 and a Half Stars,"This is the only Jay-z CD I have so I can't compare it to his other works. Overall, this album's alright. Jay-z's skill on the mike is undenialbe, but there are really only a few noticeable tracks on the CD. ""Watch Me,"" ""Snoopy,"" and ""Big Pimpin"" are great but most of the other songs are just alright. However, there are a couple songs that are just annoying. If you like Jigga, this ain't a bad buy."
2,Jigga can do better,"I seriously don't care 4 this. Jigga did such a good job with volume 2 why ruin it with such a not hot album. BIG PIMPIN, DO IT AGAIN, and ANYTHING are the only reasons i like this one enough to not sell it. Jay fans, get REASONABLE DOUBT and VOLUME 2, you'll be much happier. This is one to keep on the shelf for the person who wants to spend 20 bucks on it to buy."
4,Don't have to skip songs,"Camino Palmero is a really good cd, probably one of the best. It is great because, you don't have to skip songs because, every single one of them is a topper. It can get you pumped up when you blast it on your radio or it can mellow you if you play the cd quietly on your radio. My three favs are #3 ""where ever you will go"" #4 ""could it be any harder"" and #11, ""stigmatized""If you are into alternative music but not really hard core, The Calling is the way to go."
5,This is such a must-have cd!!!,"This is the best cd that I have ever heard in my entire life. This band has such a good beat and they have such a great lead singer. His name is Alex Band and he sings like you would never beleive. Aaron Kamin, and Sean Woolstenhulme play the guitar like I have never heard before. Billy Mohler plays the bass and he is so absolutly awesome, and last but not least Nate Wood is the drummer and his beat rocks. If you don't get this CD you are really missing out on something great. All of the songs are so good it will just blow you away. My favorites are Adrienne, Could It Be Any Harder, Things Don't Always Turn Out That Way, and Wherever You Will Go. These are just some of my favs. but I really love them all. If you want to check out the others go to their website... beleive me it rocks. Anyway if I could tell you to go to the store and buy anything this CD would be it. I hope you think all of these things about this band as well."
5,Awesome Debut Disc!!,"This is one of those CD's where you don't have to search for a great song, they are all top notch. What makes this disc so special is the combination of the lyrics and vocals. You believe every word he says and relate to his pain and insecurity. ""Camino Palmero"" will be one of 2001's most memorable releases. Very very good."
4,the new lifehouse,"the first time i heard this cd i was in a Target store. i heard the song ""whereever you go"". i closed me eyes and it sounded like a cross btwn the goo goo dolls and lifehouse. the crooning vocals of the man behind the mike just relax you. the first couple songs (Unstoppable for instance) have a harder kick to them, but then you seem to settle in to some of the best music i have heard in a long time. if you like lifehouse,sister hazel, or goo goo dolls.. give this cd a shot. you will NOT be dissapointed. :)"
4,Very good,"Seeing The Calling perform live for the first time I was shocked. Could such a great rock sounding voice come from this Backstreet Boyish looking kid? The voice certainly does not match the face but that's part of what makes Alex Band so unique. He truly has a talent in singing and some of the songs on this album are great such as ""Wherever You Will Go"" and ""Final Answer."" This album would be perfect if it weren't for some of the lesser songs. While the band does have talent in performing songs they lack some in writing them. The lyrics are a bit bland and meaningless. I think if they had a little help from some top song writers and producers they would sound phenomenal."
2,Alright,"I bought this Cd for the song ""wherever you will Go"". I absolutly loved this song. It is a slow love ballad. I'm sure you heard it before on the radio. When I got the Cd I was disapointed. The other songs are boring and not nearly as good as wherever you will go. I like the song stigmatized alright, but the others are disapointing. I don't listen to this Cd much. Its better if you have Kazaa to download a couple songs before you buy this Cd because that would give you a better idea of the songs on it. Mostly I was disapointed. I expected more from the calling. I think they have a lot of talent, but maybe should stick with the slower songs. I recommmend this cd to anyone that likes lifehouse, or creed."
3,Better than I'd like to admit,"Okay, I'll be honest, I didn't like these guys before I ever gave them a chance. But in my defense, I had a decent reason. After hearing their first single, I lumped them in with all the rip-off artists who come out of the woodwork when a ""sound"" hits big. I put them in with the Tuffs of the Poison era or the O-Towns of the BSB era. But alas, there is some talent here afterall. What initially sounded to me like a cross between Fuel and Creed with obvious intention, turned out to have merit of its own. I'm still not a die-hard Calling fan and the album isn't what I would call rock solid but the singles are good and the hooks are catchy. If you like the first single, you will probably like most of this CD. If you love the first single or any member of this young band, you will undoubtedly love the whole CD (even the fillers). It's generally as mellow as what's on the radio and pretty melodic through and through."
5,From TheBegining To The End,"From the begining to the end Camino Palmero, by The Calling is absolutely amazing. Each song is written so that you really can feel the music. I could listen to this cd over and over and still be able to enjoy it."
3,Sweet system!!!,This is a sweet system. The reason I didn't give five stars is for one of the same reasons that someone else didn't. The speakers are hard wired and it does make it hard to run the wire. The other reason is because I have had a problem with mine! One night we were watching a sweet movie. The sound was great and everyone was into it. Then all of the sudden the sound turned off! The movie was still going but I couldn't hear any thing. When we turned it off and then on again it seemed to fix it. Then it did it again! So I took it in to get it fixed and they replaced a part in it that costs about $1.00. It didn't fix it. I have yet to have it fixed. Has any one else had this problem?
4,Perfect Day,"One song, ""Perfect Day"", is worth the price of this CD. Buy it. The other songs aren't bad either."
3,"An excellent account, but...","This is an excellent book that masterfully breaks out and retells one of the most important stories of our times. No stone is left unturned and Kengor takes the time to recognize the numerous other personalities involved with the collapse of the Soviet Union.I was extremely disappointed, however, in what appears to be a ""hit piece"" against Ted Kennedy shoe-horned into the midst of this otherwise excellent book. Ted Kennedy making overtures to the KGB for political reasons? Why is this outrageous claim so poorly sourced. Kengor should be ashamed of himself for bringing the clearly bogus and agenda-driven Kennedy segment to the story. By doing so he's created another dishonest club with which the anti-Kennedy crowd can use to abuse the Senior Senator from Massachusetts - an imperfect man, to be sure, but by no means a traitor as described by this book.I rate this book 5 stars minus 2 because of the Kennedy nonsense for a total of 3 stars."
4,"Great pictorial history, but not as much recorded history unpacked.","I was hoping this book would be a walk through of the history of Boulder including it's places, people and persona. What this book offers instead is a pictorial history of the various neighborhoods and places around Boulder, then and now. It's fun to see many of the places I have visited around Boulder and how they looked, but I still felt lacking in the history of how Boulder came to be what she is today as a city. This book is still a great resource for those who want to see Boulder from pictures."
3,IT'S FUN FOR ME!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I play this game alot. It's pretty fun for children to play , but when you play it for a long time it starts to get kind of boreing. You start with not many mini games because in order to get more you have to get really high scores on the other mini games. I enjoy play operation krabby patty , but not so much that I could give it five or four stars. So I gave it three."
3,Data Modeling Mad Simple,I thought the book was a bit general. I have started a data modeling job and will need more to do the job.
4,Great first book for Data Modeling,The ease of flipping pages with easy understanding is a core feature of any good book and this one has it. I feel that this is a good start for anyone looking to learn more on data modeling or anyone who is pursuing business & data analysis.
4,"A new style for the ""Rey""","I enjoyed this album instantly when I first listened to it two years ago. Rey Ruiz debuts ""Fenomenal"" with his new record company and he certainly has changed his style. This salsa has new rhythms, new energy and new acoustics. This is a nice come back for Rey Ruiz who has dwindled over the past few years. He virtually has had no significant recognition since his album ""Destino"" or prior. The only flaw on this album is the quality of recording. There is a lot distortion which is unfortunate because it ruins the flavor of such a tremendous album. The album is great other than the recording flaws."
5,Very nice precision set.,Very nice precision set. Exactly what you would expect from a nice set of adjustable ParallelsGlad they are in my toolbox. I expect they will last me a lifetime.
5,Good Read,Enjoyed this one very much. I am a Kevin Kerney fan. Think I have read everyone of the Kerney books and this one is right up there with my favorites.
2,Not very good unless you are an expert already,"I was very, very disappointed with this manual. I bought it to change out my fule injectors. Information is way too technical for beginners or intermediates. Too many sections assume you have a working knowledge already. Pass this one over for the Chilton's version which has step by step instructions with pictures."
5,Haynes Repair Manual Review,"I am very pleased to rate my experience with Amazon as EXCELLENT on my receipt of a like-new Ford Explorer HaynesRepair manual. It was in fine condition and shipped in a timely way. Great service!Sincerely,Neil Roth"
4,Good guide,This book is fairly well detailed and has most of the information a person would need for doing home auto repairs. Fair price compared with others.
1,Book review,I was pleased to receive the manual in a timely manner. I soon found out it was the wrong manual. I receiveda 1991 - 1992 explorer manual. I had ordered a 1991 -2001. So I tried to contact them but all I could get wereother products that could be purchased from them. I am very unhappy about this experience and probably won'tuse them again.
5,Inspiring for all Singletons in USA,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Bridget Jones' adventures with her friends and her romantic troubles are very well-written. She is a very perceptively written character who does what all young singles do -- obsess over our weight, boyfriends, bad jobs, etc.If you like this book -- be sure to read the sequel - the Edge of Reason."
4,Smug Married reader from Richmond,"Personnally, cannot relate to Bridget at all. She is a heavy drinking, cigarette smoking, sloppy, airhead. She takes no responsibility for her life and waits for things to happen to and for her. Fairy tale ending not believable or possible in the real world for this woman, though it will make for a great, sappy end to a major motion picture in which Hugh Grant will likely be cast. HOWEVER, I read the book in just three days and found it very funny. Well worth a try in between more serious reading."
3,Total mind candy. Like comics without pictures.,"The perfect ""between books"" read. No brain power required, or expected, but it's funny as all get out. One hopes, however, that the main characters life is not typical of her contemporaries. Read this book today, then leave it in the loo to provide a good chuckle for guests...."
5,I'VE NEVER LAUGHED SO MUCH !!,"Bridget Jones' is one very funny character...and she is very true to life. I am married now, but when I was single, I had a life very similar to hers. This book is just pure entertainment. If you are looking for a meaningful literary experience go elsewhere - this is just a hilirious read - it was quick and easy and i would recommend it to any woman who has an annoying mother, or ever had any bad luck with men!!"
2,Anyone could have written this book.,"Anyone could have written this book, and most of would have done it better. This book is about an ordinary person doing ordinary things. Those who think this is a good book must have a boring life."
2,Should have waited for the paperback.,"Must join those who give this book a barely passable review. The author is obviously capable of producing better. Bridget is a brainless, self-absorbed twit, of the type that give all women a bad review. I gave it two stars only because the characterizations were decent; otherwise the book is a waste of time and money."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I know it's a diary, but still felt it was a disjointed read which I found difficult to get into. At times I could identify with the character, but mainly it was just tooooo silly. Can't imagine why everyone else thinks it's so great."
4,Engaging and Amusing!,"Bridget Jones's Diary is a wonderful book that is completely worth reading. Having just returned from England myself, I loved reading the English slang that Fielding uses. Yes, November and December are a bit outlandish, but it provides a great ending to an entertaining book. I can't wait to read the sequel!"
4,Bridget Jones makes me LAUGH OUT LOUD,"Jane Austen she isn't...but Helen Fielding's modern interpretation of Pride and Prejudice is a lovely and entertaining account of the trials (however menial and shallow!) and triumphs of modern day singletons! Bridget is an endearing character--witty, observant, insecure but also strikingly self empowered. She is plagued with all the contradictions of 1990s society. The novel begins with her New Year's resolutions so it would make a great read this January. When the ""smug marrieds"" ask Bridget about her dating life in the first chapter, you WILL, NO DOUBT, laugh out loud! Although her next novel, AGE OF REASON, has yet to be released in the U.S., it is even more entertaining, and less predictable, than Bridget Jones Diary. A MUST READ! However, you absolutely must see the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice before reading this second work. It will greatly enhance Fielding's merciless humor!"
5,"Time Spent Re-Reading Bridget Jones, 5 hours (v.v.g)","""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is laugh-out loud funny. I resisted reading it for years because I hate all things ""Ally McBeal""/women's self-help-like and that's what I feared it was. But it's incredibly funny, warm, smart and real. I also recommend the follow-up and Helen Fielding's first book ""Cause Celeb."" Not to mention that earlier work ""Pride & Prejudice."" Mark Darcy/Mr. Darcy...Ding-Dong."
1,Entirely Disappointing!,"I bought this book because I'd heard so much about it and I simply couldn't wait to start reading it. However, after the first few pages, already, I started to wonder what all the fuss about this book was about?! I made myself read on, only to finally put this book aside after having ""worked"" my way 2/3rds through it. How could such nonsense with its shallow level of jokes/humor possibly make it to a #1 New York bestseller? It completely beats me!!! (I am reading A LOT (am a book worm), have almost never before NOT finished a book!)"
1,Sleep Aides Not Needed,"I'm so glad my life is not like this. This is so unrealistic. For someone to constantly check weight, calories, fags.... on a daily basis -- no wonder she isn't married or can truly concentrate on a relationship as the total focus of her life is herself. I travel to Europe pretty regularly and have never read this author's column (if I had done so I would have not purchased this book). Come back to reality......"
2,only hype,"What a disappointment. I just read Animal Husbandry, which is a very similar story, a better read, so maybe I was burnt out on this topic. It had the same formula of a best girlfriend and gay best friend who just seem to be at her beck and call 24/7, never understanding what was the draw to her. She is not a likeable or insightful character and the whole business with her mother was just too unbelievable. I had some mixed feelings about the weight entries - why is she considering herself fat at 130? I know that women have distorted views about themselves but I just could not relate (maybe there was a mix-up in the metric conversion!?)"
1,I know most peope praise this book but...,"I found this book horrible. I have read sooo many better written, better interesting fiction novels. I was not even able to finish this small thin book because there was nothing interesting about it. Bridget's life was about booze and her infatuations and other stuff. It was dull and pointless. Hate thi book."
3,Bridget Bugs Me!,"I hope not too many people can identify with Bridget; she makes awful decisions regarding herself and men, has no self control and basically is not in charge of her life. Easy read but had difficulty identifying with the characters."
3,JONES!,"First off, I tend not to like to rate books with stars, as I like to choose an emblem that somehow illustrates the theme of the book or movie I am reviewing. For instance with Catcher In The Rye, I used a Blueberry Muffin. Mm, mm, muffins!, for Lolita, I used a thermometer, and for Crime and Punishment, I used a surly dwarf. Mm, mm, dwarves! Here I would again use a muffin. Speaking of which..."
3,I like this kind of book,"This book is sort of New-York-neurotic-though-semi-empowered-female-fiction (though not in New York). It is pretty fun, I guess, and clearly people enjoy it.Still, it is a little thin. The characters are paper, and, well, I just don't know. Obviously a story doesn't have to be amazing or realistic to be good (I should hope not) but this is just ok. And I really do like the aforementioned genre (even if I'm sometimes embarassed to admit it)."
3,decent,"alright, so everybody says that bridget jones's diary is absolutely hilarious, so i thought i'd jump on the bandwagon and give it a read. it was entertaining, but i must confess that i did not laugh out loud once. sorry, y'all. i found her observations amusing, but nothing terribly witty that made me double over with gales of laughter. the pride and prejudice parallels were certainly a nice touch, but give me elizabeth bennet and mr darcy over bridget and mark any day!"
4,Great Light Reading,"Bridget's Diary was certainly entertaining. It had me laughing out loud in several scenes, and I enjoyed its parallels to Pride and Prejudice. Definitly worth your time if you are looking for something fun to read. Any woman can relate to at least some part of Bridget's life."
2,Bridget is pathetic,"This book was not funny, although the author tried desperately to make it so. It was an OK read at best. I do not recommend it to anyone."
2,Ho hum,"I was so disappointed in this book. It started out well but I got sick of reading the same things in every entry. Bridget goes on and on about how fat she is, then reveals in one entry that her thighs are 19 inches. I just got disgusted at that point because it made it seem like all of her hystrionics about the rest of her life's problems were all for nothing. Yuck!"
2,Purposeless,"What's the point? Or, better yet: What's the big deal? Maybe it is a gender thing. I'm a guy, so i don't get the humor of Bridget Jones's Diary. The book is not funny. I found it quite tedious and i often wanted somebody to boot Bridget in the head. I did sympathize with the character at times. Quite a few times to be perfectly honest. Reading this book, i found myself waiting for a payoff that never came. I finish one chapter and think, ""How dull."" I finish another, ""How dreary."" I finish the book, ""How tedious...and i'll never get that time back."" That's when i know i got nothing out of a book, when i realize that i've just wasted whatever amount of time i spent reading it. With all of the hype surrounding this book, i just feel let down and betrayed. It just wasn't interesting."
1,I didn't like it either,"Readers MUST relate to the heroine in order to find this funny, which means: they must find one's weight; food, drink and tobacco intake; clothes; cellulite; wax jobs; and every little frivolous emotion to be absolutely fascinating. I know that some women talk endlesssly about such issues, but no one I know wants to be within 50 miles of them. Those looking for splendid humorous fiction from contemporary British novelists should read Nick Hornby, David Lodge, and those with ambition will be rewarded with Salman Rushdie's extraordinary prose and fantastic comic view. These authors feature fully developed characters immersed in real dilemmas and within a truly universal view of humanity."
5,"Bridget Jones, Everywoman","Every woman that reads this book will be left wondering, ""How did Helen Fielding get a hold of my diary?!"""
3,Not all it was promised to be,"Many of those I spoke to who had read this novel claimed it was hilarious and that it was a ""must read"". It was humorous but I found I was bogged down with the main character's lack of self esteem and her constant battle with weight gain/loss, smoking, and drinking. Her obsession with finding a man was also somewhat tedious. The actual comic relief came from her mother, who was annoying, but whose relationship with Julio, a slimy Latino criminal, was laughable. I guess I was expecting more from this story...it was OK but not terribly memorable. A worthwhile find for a long plane ride or a summer's day on the beach."
5,One of the funniest books ever written,If you don't like this book you have no sense of humor whatsoever and should seek medical attention immediately.
3,Pride and Prejudice? Hardly. Entertaining? V.,"When this book came out I thought it looked like this cliche-ridden, trite piece of Cosmo-style fluff. Then a friend recommended it so I gave it a whirl. Sure enough, I was right all along. But hey, we can all enjoy some fluff now and then. I suspect I wouldn't enjoy it half so much if it weren't for her amusing (to Americans) London vernacular, but what the heck.Bridget is the kind of person I avoid as much as possible - obsessive about weight, desperate about men, a sloppy drunk and extremely shallow. Then again, we've all had our phases like that in one way or another. I do enjoy the honesty about the drinking and smoking - I don't think an American woman would even be allowed to write a book like that!It's a silly, entertaining book and I'll probably read the sequel. But please don't compare it to P&P!! Anyone can write a book and call a character ""Darcy""!"
3,Glorified romance novel,"This book wasn't nearly as funny as I had anticipated based on all the hype, though I enjoyed it once I got 12-13 ""days"" into it. Basically, this is just a re-packaged romance novel."
4,A great quick read,"I have seen both the movie, and read the book. I can honestly say this is one of those few that the movie and the book compliment each other well. The book is a quick and enjoyable read. This book entertains while it helps us see that our personal faults, or even hang ups really aren't all that bad. I enjoyed the book a great deal."
3,Hey. lighten up! It's not THAT bad,"This is not Shakespeare. There are times when we look for something light and inconsequential for a read. Even though we might subscribe to National Geographic at home, we might feel like reading People at the doctor's office. This book is trite and simple, but sometimes this is what the reader wants. If you need something of more substance, pick John Updike or Joyce Carol Oates. Sure Bridget is self-pitying and has no ""real"" problems in her life, but at one point or another we might have felt this way too, sorry for ourselves because there is nothing too serious going on (disease, death, poverty, ethical issues, etc). So what? (BTW, the AllyMcBeal comment is right on).Anyhow, apart from the character of the mother, which is way too cartoonish, the book is OK. Just read it when your brain is at 35% capacity."
5,A very funny must read,"This book is very funny and so true. My wife, daughter, daughter in law and myself all read it and could not put it down. For all those who continually diet and or make self improvement plans you will love this book."
4,"Candy. 100% pure, delicious, utterly nutritionless candy.","To say Bridget Jones is the literary Ally McBeal... well, it's just not right. Bridget Jones is firmly grounded in the real world of feminine insanity where Ally is more of a cartoon. As a male, I can only hope half of the book is as dead-on with the Singleton as it seems, because it means that women are definitely the more interesting of the species while men are, well... this book pretty much nails men, too. I'm a slow reader, but this is one book that took no time and little effort to read and enjoy. It's not Jane Austen, but that's not necessarily an insult."
3,Adrian Mole has nothing to worry about,"The attraction of Bridget Jones's Diary is evident in its name: it's a diary, a private book that social custom decrees should be safe from prying eyes. This novel's premise appeals to the voyeur in all of us. However, I can't find it the scream that so many of its fans do. After so many pages, Jones's wittering on about her weight climbing a pound or two or her smoking 20 as opposed to 7 cigarettes was merely annoying and pathetic. This impression was the author's intention, hopefully, but the joke wears thin. Preferable are Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole diaries for sheer comedy and greater insight into human nature. Read Bridget Jones's diary, if you must, but only a copy from your local public library. I don't believe it's worth the $24 price to buy it."
3,...but it made me LAUGH!,"okay, i see where all the negative reviews are coming from...but i liked this book for precisely the reasons they hated it. yes, it was vapid, but isn't life? yes, it was contrived, but it's FICTION!!! hello? i LOVED every second of the three hours it took me to read this book. just don't expect too much or you'll be SORELY disappointed. think of it the same way you think of Ally McBeal. if you love her for what she is, then you'll love this. if not, go pick up _Memoirs of a Geisha_ or something."
4,Lighten up,"Please don't spend time comparing this to ""Pride and Prejudice""--enjoy this for what it is: a light-hearted look at being a 30-something Singleton in the 90s. I loved the part about regretting the answering machine message. Who can't relate to that?"
5,"A hysterical view of the ""Singleton"" life. MUST READ!!!!","I have only begun to take up reading again, this book is a book most single women can relate to. I couldn't put it down, laughed out loud, avoided answering the phone, (1471 to find out later who it was...lol)was late for work just to finish. Us ""Singletons"" can so relate to the ""Emotional Fuckwittage"", commitment phob, or downright loser men that Bridget has spent her life wasting time with. Also, the calorie, fag, and alcohol unit counting is true to myself and all my ""Singleton"" friends. This book is funny, cynical, and yet very real, I can now legally change my name to Bridget Jones, as I am her, she is me (lol). If you are over 26 and facing your days single, and concerned about your weight and vices this book will make you laugh at yourself while laughing at Jones."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I have never laughed so much. I found myself laying in bed late at night in fits of laughter and able to completly relate. I encourage anyone who is thirty something or approaching and who has experienced the horrids of the dating world to pick this up instead going to the bar one Friday night, its cheaper, less calories and more fun than anyone you would have met!"
2,"Cute, but nothing great...","I enjoyed this fictitious diary about Bridget, a thirtysomething stressing about men, diets, and men...did I mention that? However, since I'm not British, and a bit young for the series, it was not that easy to relate to Bridget, even though I did like her. I also knew I missed quite a few jokes with all the British slang. It has it's cute moments, but overall, it's just basically a fluffy light read, nothing more."
3,A disappointment,"I had really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it full of tired cliches and stereotypes. I'm a thirty-something ""singleton"" myself, but found little to identify with even though I face the same issues. It wasn't nearly as funny as I expected."
3,Bubblebath Entertainment,"I must admit, I tried to read this book a few years ago and put it down after about five pages, very disappointed (given all the press it had gotten).But looking for a good bubblebath read -- something that wouldn't require too much thought -- I picked it up again after finding an old edition for just a few bucks.This time around I got into it and read it quickly. This is one of those rare instances in which I did prefer the movie, but the book kept me entertained, despite the fact that Bridget and I are practically polar opposites. Still, I think that most young women can relate to struggling to keep our life on course, keep our love lifes stable, and satisfied with our bodies."
3,Light read but do not expect too much humor,"Yes, I liked the book. I was expecting it to be really humorous, but it really wasn't a laugh out loud book. It is a light read and one can get through it quickly. I didn't dislike the book, but I was expecting more. It is well worth reading and I found it entertaining."
2,So-So,"I guess I'm one of the few people who didn't think this book was fall down hysterical or typical of what women experience in the dating world. Although it has some funny moments, it didn't keep my interest all the way through, and I ended up putting it down and picking it up over the span of a few weeks. I actually found the character to be more pitiful, than funny and couldn't help but think, who the heck would do all these stupid things??? I know it's just a book, but I think it's just so-so."
5,Oh Bridget...,"How can you not love Ms. Jones?! Fielding's novel is a great example of singletons everywhere; all obsessed with love, work, weight, men, weight, men and of course...weight!! The bit with Colin Firth is just too much for words, as Bridget's obsession with Mr. Darcy takes over the interview. Jones makes you laugh, cry and wonder about life and what it holds...the witty banter and the closeness of friends makes you ache for more!!"
2,Doesn't Compare to the original!,"I'm sorry to say, but I was very disappointed by this ""redacted"" version of the original. I ordered it online expecting the original, but found that it was not nearly as funny. I remember laughing out loud reading the original on the train! As expected, I highly recommend the original (a 5 Star Plus!). I also have to say that I was disappointed that there was nothing at amazon stating that it wasn't the original."
3,"Amusing, but not what I expected","This will make you laugh, I think every woman can identify with some element of this book. However, don't believe the reviews you read that scream, ""Bridget Jones is me!!!"" At least I hope not, because that makes me fear for the future of females in society."
3,90's version of Pride and Prejudice,"I kept thinking, that the story was sounding familiar. Then Mark ""Darcy"" came into the picture and I knew excatly was was going to happen. I suggest you read Jane Austin's ""Pride and Prejudice"" instead. I liked ""Bridget Jones,"" but I always favor the original."
2,don't believe all the hype-not uproarisly funny,It was an easy read but did not hold my interest. In fact after reading this book only days before I could hardly remember enough to discuss at book club. A taped interview by the author was the most interesting part of the evening. As a 40's something there was very little I could relate too. In fact at times I wanted to shake Bridget and say-wake up there is a REAL world out there--find it.
2,v.b.,"Although there were funny moments, all in all the book severely disappoints. Bridget is certainly neither a feminist nor particularly appealing. Many of the characters, including Bridget's extraordinarily obnoxious mother, are completely flat and unbelievable. Not to mention the fact that the conclusion is too ridiculous for words. If you must read it, borrow a copy - you'll be happy to have not wasted the $13."
3,Diary of a NEUROTIC overly sensitive mad woman,"Bridget did in fact leave me laughing out loud a few times, however I felt a slight bit of disappointment throughout the book.I don't see women as being overly neurotic, overly sensitive, waiting to get married freaks. I CAN'T STAND the fact that she is weighing herself sometimes four or five times daily. After the first fifty pages I decided to skip the weigh in notes.I see a lot of women on here saying that this is just how they think. I feel sorry for you. Looks and ""partners"" are important, however they shouldn't rule your life to no end. I am a strong believer that women are a lot different than Bridget. We are strong, beautiful in our own ways and can deal without a man!Three stars because at sometimes it is unbelievably funny :)"
3,Not as funny as I thought it would be...,"It is basically as described in its title; the diary of Bridget Jonnes, whom I thought would be much funnier. I think those who said it was hilarious gave it much more credit than it deserves. Bridget Jones is a woman in her 30s who THINKS she's funny and shows us, through what she writes in her diary, how her life developes within a year.I kept reading the book, hoping it would get more intresting, but it didn't. I actually like reading stories written as diaries, but this one did not meet my expectations. Try reading ""Diary of a mad Bride"", you'll see what I mean. :)"
1,UGH - self obsessed drivel,This was among the most difficult books I have ever read. I never felt connected to the whining and ridiculous heroine. As a person in my late 20's I found it insulting as a genre and thoroughy unentertaining. Don't waste your time.
4,Every Single Girl's Diary: A Novel For All,"If you don't mind some of the language, which wasn't all that alarming these days, you just might find yourself captured by Bridget Jones' terrific determination. Bridget is a no nonsense gal, who has learned to deal with her woes in the most imaginative ways. I enjoyed her daily account of pounds lost (and gained), how many ""fags"" she had smoked, how many calories she had consumed, and various other acccounts custom designed to the season she was in. She was cute, and funny, and I wanted to be her friend.I found Bridget to be brilliant at times, and I laughed out loud more than once. It was a bright and airy read, that left me with some residual giggles. I could relate to her plight, and I whole heartedly embraced her struggles, both simple and traumatic (depending on her mood.)I would recommend BJ's Diary to just about anyone who can take an honest look at life and still find a reason to laugh. It was V.G."
1,"five stars bad, one star good","If you're a woman and you gave this book five stars, you deserve everything you presently have in your life. If you're a woman and you gave this book one star, may you be blessed with a life that is filled with wonderment, inquiry and discrimination. And may your kids be good looking and intelligent too! Is that hollow laughter I hear ? - No that's just Bridget actingt natural..."
4,My son loves this story,"We got this story with the Read with Me DVD set. I was worried that my son (2 and 1/2 years old) would find this story scary. I almost put it away until he was older, however this is his favorite story on the system (we have four total). We watch this over and over again. He is able to answer the questions correctly, without much prompting. He refers to the ""Wild Things"" as animals he recognizes...a moose, a lion, a bird, etc... Therefore, it isn't scary to him. He was even doing ""a little dance"" like the animals on the story. I really like this system. He is able to read a book and answer comprehensive questions in a fun way. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,My son loved it!,My 4 year old son loved wearing this for Halloween. We added ties under the arms to keep them in place.
5,In Memory of My Grandma,"To begin with, in memory of my grandmother, I was searching for a book that could assist me with planning a family reunion from top to bottom. This book does this and more. Beasley begins by discussing planning committees and gradally moves on to very important issues such as money matters, record keeping, and preservation concerns.Without a doubt, this family reunion planner will definitely be a great source for beginning family reunions. The author prepares a solid foundation for those who desire to unite the family through reunions. Thank you Beasley."
2,So Forgettable,"I've seen reviews in the print media griping about JD Fortune and his posing as Michael Hutchence. Fortune is NOT the problem. He is saddled with lame, forgettable, hook-less songs to sing. The only memorable and decent song on the album is the one he penned (Pretty Vegas) on the reality TV Show. There is no Devil Inside, Suicide Blond, or even Taste It here. Despite the tragic loss of their bandmate, one would think that after all these years the Farris brothers would have had a shed full of catchy songs. The album is certainly listenable, but so forgettable. I suggest you see 'em live and hopefully they will focus on their old stuff and leave most of the new stuff out of their set."
1,Sorry To Say,Sorry to say but my daughter bought this cd and played it for me. The only decent song is Devils Party and I have trouble listening to that cause it ain't no Michael. Gee I sure do miss the old INXS!! Save your money people!!
1,the singer's name,"is JD Fortune.. Isn't that bad enough? Can we get a lamer rock name, please? how about ""Rick Bitchin""? Oh wait, Johnny Bravo might be available.."
1,Went to the INXS show In Los Angeles last night,I just want to say that JD Fortune hit all the right notes but still lacked one important thing....passion. He sang by numbers.Just as a note I have to say that the band did not make ONE SOLITARY MENTION OF THEIR FORMER LEAD SINGER MICHAEL HUTCHENCE last night. No mention no tribute no nothing! Not a word! How sad to realize that the Farris brothers are capitalists first and musicians second... To me INXS has ended with MH.
2,"It's ""OK""","Ok I guess I should not complain because I won this TV this summer, but I agree with the person who said they have a buzzing sound. Sometimes when I am watching a show and it makes a cut to the next scene you can hear a buzzing sound, which is quite loud. It is rare but it does happen. On another note, i was walking around my room on my cell phone and when I got near the TV it was buzzing so loud, but when i stepped away from the TV it was fine. It is an overall ""OK"" TV. But I don't think that I would buy it, I am glad I got it for free. It doesn't have a clock, you can't change the tint, color, or anything!"
1,Save your money,"These are very poorly made and they are not sharp at all. The box is also poorly made. If this is their idea of a premium router bit, I hate to see what their economy class is like. I bought this as a quality test before buying a mill/drill/lathe. Needless to say I will not be buying it from them."
3,Holmes in the Web,"This entry in the Universal series is the least atmospheric up to this point and the filmmaking feels pretty generic. At least the humor in the opening scenes is thankfully understated. The scenes of cat and mouse between Holmes and the Spider Woman are good, though it's a bit unnerving to see Rathbone darkening his skin for some of them. This picture doesn't have the patriotic send-offs of the earlier films."
3,One of BB's good releases.,"The BB have a habit of only having every other record of theirs being really good. This one falls in to the ""really good"" category. Catchy as hell songs and some great riffs make this a repeat listen for me. Sure, BB are pretty cheesy at times, but they do what they do really, really well.Oh, I can do without the song ""friends"" though. That song blows."
5,Stockholm Syndrome [Bonus Tracks],"Backyard babies sounds like a mix between ministry with their grinding guitars and a STP copy when it comes to the vocals and lyrics and this in itself is not a small compliment. In fact this was a very pleasent surprise and this 2003 release stockholm syndrome shows that they have massive potential and if they continue to develop their sound, lyrics and vocals there is no telling of how succesfull they can be. The cover art is nice and the book-let is ok. Overall this is a very good cross over band that can reach the stars with the right releases and with a bit of luck."
1,Mickey mouse.,Very lightweight and will not haul as advertised. Spend a little more or you will pay twice.
4,Great Cart!,"This was purchased to replace a very old metal cart!Is one of the best purchases we've made ,easy to use and light!Love it!"
1,Unintentional Comedy?,"On the unintentional comedy scale I give this four out of five. There are songs on this album that make me laugh out loud, even though I know I'm not supposed to . . . that was not the intended purpose. Since this is an album of supposed serious music I have to give it 1 star. The songs are absurd. I'm annoyed by the fact that the title of the song is in the first line of almost every song. Something about that bothers me. If someone else would write the songs for her it wouldn't be as bad because she has a unique voice. But the songwriting on this is horrible, worst songs I've ever heard in my life."
3,Not Quite the Same as Pea Shoots,"I am a devoted fan of sprouts, so I thought I would try the speckled peas. They were okay, but you need to steam them briefly to bring out their flavor. Since I like the raw sprouts better, I'll only give them a rating of 3."
1,Not worth it,"Not worth two seperate volumes much less two separate charges just cause they added a few more episodes this season, this from a person whose bought all the previous seasons cause i can't watch the show at it's regular airing...Do yourself a favor and rent or borrow season 5 from a friend......"
3,Sam's club sells slim cases for less.,"Sam's Club sells 50-pack for 12.57 in Chicago land area. That's where I buy mine, that is what I call the best price, and quality is superb as well."
3,Brand name doesn't always = quality...,"I bought these to reduce the space my 14mm full size DVD cases were taking up. My experience tells me the clear cases are more resistant to cracking, compared to black cases. My search for 7mm clear DVD cases found these.The pros:+ Low cost, which included free shipping.+ Well packed & none of the cases were broken in shipment.The cons:- The shrink wrapping used on the packaging was too tight, so the cases on the ends were bowed inward. I'm not sure they'll straighten out...- One case... so far... had a bad latch & won't stay closed.I'll down grade my product rating if I find any more defective cases."
5,"Great case, great price","Not much you can say about a DVD storage case, but here goes. I'm not a fan of most Memorex products, but these cases seem pretty good. I like the slim line cases...not as clunky as the full-size models. These are transparent so that you can see the label on the DVD inside and there's also a full wrap sleeve area on the outside so that you can include a cover as well. Best of all, the price on Amazon beat the pants off the price at my local Office Depot. If you're looking for a slim DVD case, I think you'll like these."
5,The best book about the initiatic path I have read,"To read this book is similar to undergoing an initiation experience oneself. The book is very well-written, and it is hard to lay it down before reading it all the way through. Personally this book has had a profound influence on my life; I can only recommend it to the highest degree. If you are ready to get a push forward on the initiatory path, this book can do it for you! Another recommendable book in the same genre is : The Red Lion & The Elixir of Eternal Life, which describes from a first-person perspective the cycles and laws of karma and rebirth."
5,"A Great Book, HIGHLY Recommended","I have found Jesse Liberty's book the absolute best when it comes to learning C++. I love the by-example approach, tips, and clear writing. I wish Jesse would write an equally lucid book about the art of class design."
4,WORKS!,"i have oily skin and the red spots were killing me, i tried so many products until a pharmacist advised me with La roche posay fluid and it works, non oily and light texture... if you have oily skin then give this one a try."
2,"Good, BUT Does NOT work on Kindle Fire","This is a nice little resource with plenty of information on tarot, however, it will NOT work on the Kindle Fire. It works just fine on my Kindle 3G."
1,Skip This One!....,"This game suffers from many issues including: poor controls (esp for kids - the target audience), limited story line, and horrible programming (some of the audio files have audible distortion). The only redeeming quality is the ability to drive under water! I am far more pleased with the Matchbox/Caterpillar series."
5,It will bring you chills when you watch it.,"NFL Films does it like no one else can. The emotion, the music and the video all help you relive the season of destiny. With all the nervous energy for fans watching the Super Bowl you are sure to miss quite a few things and great moments. This DVD helps bring you anything you miss with additional video from the NFL films crew to compliment the game action. Mixed in you will find coaches and player commentary as well as the culmination of the Canyon of Heroes celebration.If you are a true fan you need this DVD!"
1,Bad production,This is a poorly produced video. All it shows is snippets from the games without providing any context or drama. This was a magical season and deserves a lot better.One example was the second Dallas game. They simply show the blocked kick without showing any of the tension surrounding it: the final Dallas drive or the time out to ice the kicker.In many games they praise how well the defense and offence are playing and then we see the score and the Giants are behind.The score is also where they don't provide enough context. They hardly ever discuss what the score is except if it happens to be on the video cut or a game announcer mentions it.BTW I have no problem with this being a highlights DVD. But years from now when the season isn't a fresh in my mind I won't know the significance of these video clips. I wish they had spent an hour or two actually 'providing value'
1,Misleading Title,"What a disappointment it was to discover that I had not bought the Super Bowl for my husband's birthday present! Amazon.com, I had more faith in you than that."
4,A passionately written treatise on a painful condition,"There is a touching raw honesty about this book on depression, a straightforward exploration of a painful and dangerous experience that affects so many of us. Andrew Solomon's stories are heartrending, as is the passion with which he writes. His goodwill is obvious too - the sincere wish to ""eliminate some pain for some people"". The depth of this dark and morbid experience, and the paths away from it are evoked with a poetic and intense language which is poignantly effective. Highly reccomended."
5,Best in-depth book possibly that there is,"I haven't read this, but my wife has. She doesn't read many books cover to cover, but she did this one. And it's a big book. She found it informative, and that the information in the book made sense, based on her experience with our own lives. She said it's the best book on the topic she's found. A phychologist that I know has also told me she thinks it's one of the best books in her experience, too."
2,"This is no ""atlas""","On the positive side, the personal experience of the author's depression is daunting and even insightful (it may make anyone think twice about whether they really suffer from depression, compared to the extent of his illness). But I feel mislead: from the synopses and reviews I read, I expected more than an extended self-portrait. He could have condensed his own trauma into the introductory portion and spent more time with the ""atlas"" and ""cross-cultural"" analysis that is supposedly the focal point. It lost my interest quickly."
4,Deep and Fascinating Book,"This book covers depression from many angles, from the biochemistry involved to the existential questions that (should) bother eveyone.Solomon looks at how depression is viewed in other cultures, what makes us happy and sad, and maps out the fine road between physiological depression and just feeling blue.He broaches the subject of suicide with admirable straightforwardness and clarity. I really like his observation that with suicide a person not only destroys themselves, but also the entire world that they perceive.The book is enjoyable to read and is not overly technical. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand this core aspect of being human."
4,Charming,"Slow moving, southern charming, humorous story. I enjoyed the characters and their love and care of their friend, town, and way of life."
3,Nice read,Interesting relationship with a group of southern women and the decisions they make. Friendship and support are key elements in the story.
3,A fun little read,"This book was a fun little read and highlights the unique form of women's friendships in the south. The book was set in little Tea Olive Georgia and we meet some fun and whimsical ladies of the Tea Olive Bird Watching Society. These are women that grew up together, and whose ancestors settled and farmed in the area around Tea Olive. They are all busy with volunteer work, board meetings and of course bird watching. Then a new man arrives in town, and a retired judge from the north no less. The whole community is all in a twitter. Then they begin to realize that this judge doesn't necessarily have their best interests at heart and has his own hidden agenda. When one of the club's ladies marries the judge, it brings all the troubles ever closer. Reading as these ladies plan ways to help their friend is hilarious. This author does a good job of character development, and the setting is portrayed realaistically too. Lots of fun and quite delightful."
1,Couldn't get through it.,"I tried reading this book, but I just couldn't get into it and finally quit trying after a few chapters.. Boring may be the best description."
4,the olive tree bird watching society,A very enjoyable read with memorable characters. I appreciated the realistic view of domestic violence and the innocence that not only the characters but the trust people who have only experienced people of good intension put in strangers.
5,great crappy movie,"this movie is far far far away from being a masterpiece, but i've loved it since i was a kid. the only problem is, it's almost impossible to find, anywhere. they really need a dvd version!"
1,A waste of time and money unless you like looking at Vincent,"This movie is terrible. Brenda Fricker and Patrick Stewart, two class acts, must have had urgent bills to pay. If I could give this zero stars I would. It had to be a candidate for one of the worst films of the year. DON'T BOTHER!"
4,One Crazy Lady!,The book club members thought this was a fast and interesting read. It made you become aware that there are some crazy people and that love can make you act the FOOL!!
2,Predictable,The story line was a great ideal. However for avid readers you will find the bookVery predictable stories such as this should take you through a tunnel and the light should be found at the end not going through the tunnel and it's dimly lit along the way. Had she been more of a seasoned writer she could have pulled the story off. I gave it 2 stars for the effort. Its more of a 1 star.
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????,"This was the most ridiculous book that I have read in a LONG LONG time. I was forced to read this drivel for my book club. Most of the members of my club HATED IT!!!!! The plot was unbelievable, the character development was nonexistent! I thought that this was the author's first book so I was willing to forgive her. But, now that I know that this is her second book, I will stay away for her material forever!!!!!"
4,Crazy in a good way,Are people really crazy like this? The ending sent me for a whirl. I would be pissed if I was put in this situation.
5,Best of the MCG disks IMHO,"Of the three recent Mintzer MCG releases I think this is the best. It opens with a very fun Latin piece followed by a classic love song featuring Kurt Elling's excellent vocals. Then directly following, is a wonderful arrangement of one o'clock jump. This arrangement starts out sounding nothing like the original song. Then suddenly it morphs into it's old, familiar self, only to change back. This is in classic Mintzer style, as first seen on his Camouflage album. What a good time!The recording quality of this album is superb. Better even than the later DMP recordings. All three of his most recent MCG recordings are superior to any of the DMP recordings (with the exception of ""Gently"" which is a sonic masterpiece). Among the finest ""Live recordings"" in my collection!Highly recommended. If you enjoy Big Band you are sure to LOVE this. :-) ."
5,Grand Prix of Gibraltar,"This is a classic. This captures the very essence of SCCA road racing for anyone who was involved in it in the early days. It was a time when almost anyone could afford to go racing, and the sport drew a truly colorful group of people who were endowed with a great sense of humor. Win or lose, the sense of fun was always there...I know, I was one of them."
4,One of my favorite hot sauces.,"This used to be at a favorite Caribbean restaurant in town, its been at least a year since they carried it and I finally bought some for myself. This sauce packs heat as well as carries a little sweetness. Honestly I love it on a piece of buttered bread best but it also goes well with sweet(ish) meats. (for example: Pork chops with apples or pears, pizza with pineapple, sweet barbecue sauced things)Totally worth the purchase!"
2,Pretty blah,"I expected this book to be predictable and that's fine. Sometimes a straight-forward romantic tale is what I'm looking for. This book, however, was really bland. The cover art is the sexiest thing about it. Sure, there is sex but I would hardly call this an erotic tale. The worst part is, I didn't care enough about the characters to enjoy them getting together. The story itself was all too pat and cliched. Way too much so, even for a romance."
2,Arrrghh!,Bloody waste of money. Read Halequin romance novels with better story line. Really don't get the story! Skipped so many pages...please don't waste your money on this...ewww
3,It's John Wayne.,"Just a good movie, nothing fantastic or awe inspiring just a good story with adequate performances. You don't see too many adequate performances in movies anymore or on TV."
1,Right case wrong movie,"I ordered three movies so I didnt watch this movie for a couple of weeks. When I started to play it, it was a cartoon ""Road to El Dorado"". Now that I don't have the reciept to return it I guess I'm stuck with it."
4,"NO ""RIO BRAVO,"" BUT STILL WORTH A LOOK!","The third of Howard Hawks four westerns starring John Wayne, ""El Dorado"" lacks some of the emotional impact, and even some of the excitement and foreboding, of ""Rio Bravo,"" their previous work together. It is, for better and worse, a rehash of ""Rio Bravo."" For worse, it features the not-as-good Robert Mitchum portraying a character similar to Dean Martin's Dude, which was a powerful character in the earlier film. Also, the story is predictable for the most part. For good, though, James Caan does a better job as Mississippi in this film than Ricky Nelson did as Colorado in ""Rio Bravo."" The gunfights are also well-done. And, last but not least, it IS a John Wayne film, and no film Wayne did was bad, in my opinion.Overall, a fine film that lacks the impact of ""Rio Bravo,"" but is still an exciting John Wayne adventure! Grade: B+"
4,John Wayne Classic,"Fun to watch. Not Academy Award movie or acting, but just a good, fun western to end a busy day. Enjoyable."
5,excellant western,This is a wonderful movie. It is easily in the top 10 westerns ever made. They will never make movies like this again. I have seen it more than a dozen times over the years and love it every time. The extra's with this disc make it even better. I recommend all Howard Hawks movies especially with John Wayne.
5,My favorite John Wayne film,"Yes, El Dorado has a similar plot as Rio Bravo, and it stars the ""Duke"" and is directed by the same director.But, El Dorado has a much tighter and leaner script, and doesn't contain any dreaded ""filler"" like Rio Bravo, nor does it have the woefully miscast Ricky Nelson. (It's still a superior western though)El Dorado co-stars the much more effective James Caan, and the incomparable Robert Mitchum in a spectacular performance.A great story, a wonderful and superb cast, lots of great action and masterful direction make this a ""must-see"" western. (that ""splinters in the hand"" scene has to be seen to be believed ! )Highly recommended."
1,El Dorado DVD,I have try twice to contact Amazon to return the DVD that does not work and display only coding problems on the screen .I have follow all instruction on return This DVD to Get a replace DVD. I have been waiting three weeks for a respond form the Amazon's supplier of the DVD .
4,"Wayne, Mitchum and Hawks Deliver the Goods","Though a minority opinion, Howard Hawks' ""El Dorado"" (1966) is a superior reworking of the director's overrated ""Rio Bravo."" Along with the iconic presence of John Wayne, the tradeoffs are better: instead of Dean Martin's drunken deputy, you get Robert Mitchum's memorable comic performance; instead of Ricky Nelson singing an occasional song, there is James Caan's breakthrough performance as Mississippi; and Arthur Hunnicutt's comic relief is more palatable than Walter Brennan's obnoxious imitation of Gabby Hayes. ""El Dorado"" is a tighter, better-scripted film - running only 127 minutes. By comparison, ""Rio Bravo"" goes on forever with its 2-hour length. Hawks aficionados may disagree, but ""El Dorado"" improves upon the obvious weaknesses of ""Rio Bravo."" Judge for yourself."
2,Legion,"I was really disappointed in this movie, thought it would be leaning more toward revolutions in the bible and our Armageddon."
1,Painful to watch,"I don't typically write reviews, but for a movie THIS BAD I had to make an exception.Every part of this movie seemed like an afterthought. Aside from what the ""actors"" were paid, this movie looked like it had a $10k budget. Rent a run down desert truck stop, blow up a few cars, add some cheesy CG and there ya go. The story was weak and very loosely knit together (if at all). Worst movie of the year? You bet! The best part was when I was able to return it to the video store.As for the religious aspect of it, someone should have read a Bible before production.WWJD? He'd give it two thumbs down if he could."
3,Interesting!,"I had no espectations from this movie, but I actually liked it. it is deeper than it seems to be and it brings a different view about angels and God, with mechanic weapons and collars. Maybe an alien race? Interesting!"
2,Another one of the reviewers who didn't care for it...,"I had hopes for the movie before I found out what it was about.And once it started, it just was an entirely too weak plot to really care about.There were a few good moments, like how the angel used his wings in a fight, but that was really about it.As others said, the core plot point, the baby, seemed almost an afterthought.And let's face it - if there really is a god, and he really wanted to wipe life off the planet, could some people in a truck stop really stop it? If god really wanted to do this, why wouldn't he just do it? What would the point be in having powerful angels possess mortal bodies so the mortal bodies could be killed so easily rather than having the angels themselves do the deed in their own form which has proven indestructible to mortal efforts?Too many holes, too many places where, even though it was a fantasy story, common sense was just stretched beyond all endurance.Some big names for such a small movie..."
2,A Solid 4.2 Out Of 10,"Pretty lame actually. If you are over 15 years old, don't bother. Just bad movie-making, bad script, and even though you have a good actor in it, they must have tossed out the better cuts in favor of the B-Movie takes.The 4.2 is for the CG stuff. But don't bother."
3,Not as bad as some would have you believe,"OK, this isn't a great movie by any stretch of the imagination. But neither is it as bad as you may have heard. Its about angels, so this isn't shawshank redemption people. The problem with the movie is its just kind of, well, empty. I kept watching and expecting something big or great to happen, it never did. The acting is decent for the material the cast is working with, and the movie does have some amusing scenes. Its an average movie, not a train wreck."
5,Legion is one bad*** movie.,I didnt buy this movie until i saw it through zune because i was really optimisic of this movie although i liked the preview i was still just a little optimistic to spend 15 dollars on it but after watching it i bought it right after seeing it. this movie has non stop action and its very entertaining. the only part i didnt like is the angels transforming into monsters but i over looked that and was still able to enjoy it the people that hate on this movie must think of theirselves as critics which they are not this movie was made to be fun to watch which it is. paul bettany was great and so was the rest of the cast so if your thinking about buying DO IT.
2,Pretty bad movie,"Went into the theater to see this with low expectations. Sadly, I was still disappointed. Bad, confusing plot, and story line. Sub par acting and so-so special effects. It could of been a good movie with the story line but it was not.I wouldn't recommend you wasting your time on this."
1,Don't waste your time.,"If you saw the trailer .. then you saw the best this movie had to offer. Which makes me angry, because the trailer was sooooo good! Great idea but it is wasted on the slow, and dull flick, and it is a waste of good actors. The only good thing I can say is that everybody got paid. I wish I would have rented this instead of buying it! Heed my warning!"
1,Legion,"This is undoubtedly the worse movie I've ever seen. Even the few good actors involved: Dennis Quaid, Charles Dutton and Tyrese Gibson couldn't help it along. And, I wonder how they got hooked into participating. Well, I do know, we all need to work to live and I suppose that's why they lowered their craft and participated.The first five minutes were horrible. Throughout those minutes I was hoping at some point it would turn around; to my dismay it didn't. I'm only glad I didn't purchase.Don't purchase... rent first if you have time to waste!! Don't be saddled with this cheesy waste of time. The special effects weren't even worth the effort."
1,This movie blows,"Wow this movie was disappointing.As others have stated, the best part of the movie was the preview. It was boring, confusing, not really that scary or suspenseful, and at some times laughable.And the ""main line"" of the movie, (the line about the woman and her grandma)which I think the writers thought would be memorable, was a joke.2012, Boondock Saints 2, now this. What happened to good movies?BTW, if you want to see a GOOD scary, suspenseful movie, check out The Descent Part 2."
2,Legion ends not with a bang but a whimper,"I love movies with religious mumbo-jumbo (Constantine, End of Days, Devil's Advocate... love 'em!), and I have a high tolerance for bad and/or campy movies. Furthermore, I scare easily. So I thought Legion would be right up my alley. And I really enjoyed about three-fourths of it. Even fourth-fifths. Seventh-eights. Whatever. But the movie fizzled at the end. It wrapped up quickly and too neatly while also suggesting a sequel (which I assume has a snowball's chance in hell of getting made).Legion didn't have a big enough pay off to make me ignore the myriad questions I was left with. (e.g. Why would angels need to posses humans to kill other humans? What exactly is the baby supposed to do? Why is the kid named Jeep? What happened to Dennis Quaid's career?)Skip Legion and watch (or rewatch) Constantine instead."
5,movie magic,when i read the reviews i decided not to listen to the critics but buy for myself anyway.this movie was actually very good story line was fantastic. all i can say was that im glad that i listened to myself and bought legion on blu ray.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,I made it only 28 minutes into this movie before I realized I only had so many minutes in my life and I didn't want to waste another one on this rotten movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.
1,This Stinks,Probably the best show ever on TV and they refuse to release any more seasons. One can only hope the executives who have decided this get fired or CBS sells the rights to someone else who will release it. Another case of the entrtainment industry trying to keep anything that speaks of God out of the marketplace.
2,Hope but short for the money,There was nothing wrong with the message but don't charge people close to 15 dollars for 4 episodes. You can put 5 more dollars with it and get the series. Just thought they should at least had 12 or 15 powerful episodes. Something people can pull out when they need hope.
2,owner of 4 seasons of TBA,"From what I understand about these new 1 disc release is they are the best shows of TBA. It would be fruitless for me to buy them when I have season 1,2,3 and 4 of TBA. I may buy the disc thinking I'm getting new TBA shows and realize there's 3 shows on the disc that i already own. I don't understand why the powers that be won't release the remaining seasons. It is bad enough that the seasons were broken up into volumes so I paid a crazy price for 12 episodes at a time, now they want to sell 4 episodes at a time for crazy prices. What a rip off. I will not be buying individual dics thats for sure. maybe shout factory will buy the rights."
4,Filter for an air cleaner that works,The construction appeared to be good. It fit in the air cleaner well. It appears to work. What else to say. Air filters are air filters.
3,Not too bad,"We use this spray in the Ladies Room at work. It works really well to mask ""potty smells"", although it is a bit powerful and takes a while to dissipate."
1,Damaged case sent,The snap closure of this case had separated from the cover and was loose inside the box. No one checked this before shipping. The case itself was excellent in fit and finish and I have requested a replacement.
1,boring,"Unfortunately, my daughter says this is a yawn. It is informative but very boring. She says it tries to be creative and make math fun, but it is ""not fun."""
5,NUMBER DEVIL,"i THINK IF YOU READ THE NUMBER DEVIL YOU WILL LOVE WHAT YOUR READING BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU WOULD BE LEARNIG AT THE SAME TIME.MOST PARTS IN THE BOOK ARE SO DETAILED YOU ACTUALLY SEE IT IN YOUR MIND.THE MATH PROBLEMS IN IT GO STEP BY STEP ,AND IF YOU READ THE WHOLE BOOK YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MATH MORE. SO JUST GIVE THIS BOOK A CHANCE, BECAUSE I BELEIVE YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY THIS BOOK IT IS A REALLY GREAT BOOK!"
1,Aint worth the pain...,I bought these pedals and the fre floating cam dosent react fast enough. When i get the first hit and go for a double it woudnlt react and by the time i got thru with the song my shin muscles were on fire. I wanted to take the pedal outside and throw it away... but dont let that discourage you it might just work for you. but it didnt for me...
3,Warning! Bad Listing for Good Item,"But the item pictured with two blocks and TWO clamps is NOT the Starrett 271B.You get only ONE clamp and NO blocks with a 271B. See my review of theStarrett 271A 2 V-Block (1 Pair), 1-1/4"" CapacityHopefully Amazon has fixed the listing by this time, leaving you wondering what the heck I am talking about!"
2,Can't get into it.,"Didn't care much for this book. Drifted around, characters hard to keep track of, chucked it about halfway through. The hint should have been the original price on the jacket was 2.99"
2,Grrrr,"While the price for this thing sounded nice, this shoe rack is a big letdown. My boyfriend bought this for our room, as we are renting a room in a house and don't have much space.It's kind of a pain to assemble. It's easy to get the bars into one side but then you have to connect them into the holes on the other side and it's not easy to get them all to go in at once.Once it was together, by the time I carried it to where we were putting it, a couple of the bars came out and this is the constant struggle. You bump it, it falls apart. You put shoes on it, it falls apart. It's really not worth it. And now, two of the things you plug the bars into are cracking. My shoes aren't especially heavy or anything so I don't understand this. I had flats, slippers, sandals and Converses on there, mostly, so I'm not understanding why this cheap piece of crap is breaking. Grrr. I'm about to throw this thing away and get an under-the-bed storage bag thing. :/"
4,Does what is intended,"Not super stable, although it does what it was designed to do. You can use some piping adhesive stuff to really secure it though you need to. You could probably build something out of wood for less, but for how quick and easy this was to put together I'd say just buy this."
2,Shoe rack,This product was a good investment but the durability of this product didnt last long. This product never stays together which makes my shoes fall over the place.
4,Absolutely a must read,"As a cancer patient last year, and now done with treatments, there have been so many times I have thought about the concepts in this book. Susan Halpern explores real situations and gives practical ways of handling them as a friend, care-giver and colleague."
2,Didnt like it,"Way too crass narrative, and too gory. I was grateful for my library of quality David Attenborough dvds after watching this. Two stars because of beautiful filming. Really cheesy overall. Do yourself a favor and watch Planet Earth instead."
4,Air hose,"100 feet, I can keep my air compressor which is old fashion with fly wheel, and belt exposed to little hands, not to mention loud safely out and away for most jobs I do in my house. It doesn't bind up either, which I though might be a problem with such a thin hose."
4,It's an OK starter set,"I purchased Campbell Hausfeld MP5200 25-piece accessory kit to use with a new compressor. I am not a mechanic and only use the compressor for light work in my workshop. The acessories in this set are not, in my opinion, ""professional grade"" but they suit my purposes for the present. The parts are easy to assemble using the provided plumber's tape, but there are no assembly instructions. It helps to be a bit mechanically inclined, but it isn't too difficult to get them operational. Campbell Hausfeld, as a brand, generally enjoys good reviews. This set of accessories appeared to be the most bang for the buck, so I went with it. I will add more tools to my accessory arsenal as needed. Durability is yet to be determined as I have only used them for a few weeks, and very lightly at that."
3,It's ok,"Well, the good news is that everything works. Quality is ok. I think you can do better buying locally though (just about anywhere)."
2,dissapointment,"Arrived on time,well packaged.Nothing I could not get cheaper at my local Walmart.Pressure guage is flimsy. Many male nipples- one female?Picture implies there are some brass parts.Not.I live in a freeze thaw area that requires brass parts,these are all steel.Just going on memory here , but Amazon has on line a non-CH package costing a few dollars more with brass parts.Buy it instead."
3,Not as shown,Some of these items are shown to be brass but in fact all are the less expensive steel.
2,Farewell to Manzanar was a pretty boring book,I think that the book Farewell to Manzanar was kind of boring. There where some ok parts like when the kid punched papa in the face before papa could kill mama. There where some sad parts like when Jeannie visited the cemetery after about 30 years since she left Manzanar. Another ok part was when Jeannie was the queen for the home coming queen. But over all I think it was a pretty boring book.
4,A true feeling of what really happened to those behind wires,"At first, I thought this book had a really slow pace, but as I read and read, it really began to hit me and give me a sense that....this is told from a person who went through horror, pain, and diffulculty;WWII From what she writes, I can tell that this era, is a period she will NEVER forget, no matter how hard she tries. An exellent book to read if you want to find out about life in camp. I'd describe it in one word: ""HORRIBLE"""
4,I liked it...,"and my children like it. It is a great book to read with your children on one of the internment camps during wwII in America. The first person account is wonderful. I don't know why so many kids thought it was boring. No, there are no bombs going off, a lot of gun shooting, or killing with blood and guts but it is still a great book."
4,highly recommended,"On the west side of highway 395 sits the remains of a japanese internment camp. There are graves, building foundations and the remnants of larger facility buildings standing in silent attention to the memory of a large population that held the same heritage as the enemy the US was at war with. The mountains of the eastern sierras stand as witness to an injustice visited upon these people. Today, the reality strikes disbelief that this kind of event could have ever been allowed to occur.In a sensitive style, Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston relives her and her family's experiences at the camp. Her extended family copes as best they can in living conditions worse than some prisons. The accounting of a young girl growing up and trying to make the best of a bad situation is truly inspiring and testament to the strength and integrity of a family unit and culture strong enough to take on a deeply disturbing event."
4,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful book!","This book is about a seven year old Japanese girl who is forced into an interment camp-Manzanar. While there, she makes the best of her life. Once she leaves, she tries desperatly to become a caucasion. A hauntingly true story."
4,An excellent book!,"This is an excellent book for learning about the Japanese Internment. It was reccomended to me by my English teacher, and she was right about how well everything is described. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the Japanese Internment."
3,Its a half and half,"I thought the book was good in the begining but then some where before section 2 around the interveiw it got real confusing. She skiped around and it got real confusing. My friend and i read it for a project,and she is a very good reader and she agread with me . So parts of it were good and parts not so good."
2,review 2,"Farewell to Manzanar was a cool book, because this book tells what people did with the Japanese during World War II. No wonder we never heard of them during the time. I mostly just heard about the Jews. I would have to say that I agree with Tay on that chapter 22, ten thousand voices. That chapter was so long they might as well call it ""ten thousand pages"". Seriously, I'm sorry Mr. F, but I was about to fall out, if I read one more page of farewell to Manzanar. Until I understood what the chapter meant: Jeanne wakatsuki Houston had a family: a husband and 3 kids, was it?"
3,Farewell to Manzanar; So Long,I think this book was okay i did however learn that there are people in other places that are a lot worse off than I'am . Thankfully times have changed and our world isn't so cruel. I hope that the people in the story are a lot better off now.
4,A great book that you can learn alot from,"This was a really good book. I like true stories or things that can really happen.It was exciting and interesting. I like the part when her brother wants to go back to Japan, and when her father gets taken away and gets back. The book is funny too. One part was when her father got drunk and he drove the car and was about to wreck it.The book was sad too. I think it was sad because they should not have their family taken away, or even having to livein certain places. They are people too and they have rights just like the rest of us. People were too mean to them like the signs that said ""Japs get out of here you are not wanted"". There was another time when a woman said,""why dont you smelly Japs go back to were you came from"". I think people just need to be fair . Just because you are a different color doesnt mean people should treat you like that. 7.3bs"
3,Sad personal story of a Japanese American family,I read this book for literature class in the seventh grade. Although it wasn't my favorite book it was informative. The book told of events in the US during World War II. Many Japanese American families were forced to live in internment camps away from the coast. The author of this book and her family were sent to Manzanar in California. The FBI thought the father may be sending signals to the Japanese navy. Farewell to Manzanar is an autobiography. I learned a lot about the conditions these families had to endure. This was a very sad and shocking time in our history.
5,The Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"Nothing can be as romantic or loving as this movie. It really makes you think about all those dreams you have when you can't remember who that person is. This is Heart and Soul, without question this is what everything is all about.Watch it once. You'll feel good. Watch it again and you'll see things you didn't see before. Watch it a third time and you'll start seeing True Love. God was paying attention when this movie was being made. There is nothing better than this movie.This movie will effect your life. If it doesn't, I feel sorry for you.Most Love,KAS"
5,well that's what john would give it,john liked it and i would love to see it if i can get a copy at the video store
5,Made in Heaven,"This film is shown up in my life whenever things have been just so messed up in my relationships it is uncanny. I am true beliver in love and have thought in my life that some day I would hear that music, so whenever this film shows up and usually does just when life had has given me some nasty blow in the area of my heart. This film will just show up . There is a special magic that somehow reminds me that there is something out there waiting for me , something more a love that was meant to be. Even with all the heart ache and loss one day. We all end up with who we where went meant to be with . So ladies and gentleman watch and if you have a romantic bone in your body that belives that there is so much more to this life. This Film is a reminder, it is to me. maybe for you too."
5,Silent stomach,"Since I started taking this probiotic, my stomach has not been talking back to me - apparently any gas issues have stopped, much to my delight."
1,does not smell like grapefruit to me,I bought this thinking it would smell like grapefruit. It did not...and I did not like the fragrance. I gave it away.
1,Waste of time!!!,"I agree that aside from the underwater views of the caverns--which were great--this film sucks big time. The 'hero' is an alcoholic air-head but with a stud's muscular tanned body, and the shapely female is simply stupid with a death wish as she teams up with the boozer helping her to find her sister who's been kidnapped by Mayan treature hunters. The acting--if you can call it that--is sub-par all the way, and the undoubtedly low budget for this movie is the anchor that--for me--sinks this unrealistic, but colorful kaleidoscope in a sea of mud. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
5,Nothing stinky about this little book,"This was a great little book that entertains not only my children (ages 2 and 9 months), but also is fun for adults. After 2 Easters I'm buying a second book because my toddler has loved the first to near death. It has a catchy rhyme and hilarious illustrations that our whole family has enjoyed. I'm sure it will be a favorite in the Easter basket."
4,"yes, please","I have recently been introduced to the sounds of ""Fourplay"" and I have to say that they have definately got my attention. I was looking for some new x-mas CD's and came across ""Snowbound"" and I could not believe how beautiful they sounded. I got on the internet and starting researching all of the rest of their CD's. I have to say that ""Yes, Please"" is definately my favorite. Thanks ""Fourplay"" for enlightening another avid music lover!!"""
4,Recommended,"""Yes, Please"" is the latest Jazz album in my ever growing collection, and is very enjoyable. Larry Carlton is masterful with the guitar, as are East, James and Mason with their respective instruments. Listen for ""Blues Force""; vintage Carlton here. The beginning is reminiscent of Steely Dan's ""Pretzel Logic"". I also love ""Free Range"", ""Robo Bop"" and ""Lucky"". In the latter, hear James and Carlton alternating between piano and guitar, in this jazzy, upbeat track - my personal favorite. A great record to put on after a day at the office when you just want to sit back and relax. The only downer is the vocal ""A Little Fourplay"". Could be the best of the fall 2000 lot of comtemporary jazz CD's to select from."
3,Too small around stomach,"This is a cute jacket, but the medium doesn't fit around my beagle's stomach. The collar fits great, but the stomach strap is simply too small. The length is good, a little long, so if I went for a large then it would be way too long. It's nice material, so I'm just going to sew an extra swatch of fabric to the stomach strap and that should do the trick."
3,"Looks nice, but velcro trouble","This coat is beautiful. That being said, the velcro at the neck will not stay closed so my dog is constantly losing it. I am not sure why this is. I have been careful to be sure that the velcro is secure before walking her or letting her out, but it always comes apart and she loses the coat and I have to retrieve it. The coat is great looking and I'm sure it helps keep her warm, but if it will not stay closed it's not much use to us."
2,Didn't fit,After reading reviews and size guidelines we were disappointed a large didn't fit our 65 lb dog. Per Amazon's website it couldn't be exhanged for a XL and we had to pay for return shipping.Be certain you order the correct size.
3,Nice product but sizing was off for our dog,"I have a pappillon mix dog where his girth is 16"" and length is 18"" so went with the size chart and got the large since he was in the middle. If it was too long, I thought I could alter it but when I got it, it was meant for a lab size dog. And altering wasn't going to work. It was a soft fleece type of material. I ended up returning it. Wished it would of worked but found a different one at a store."
5,dog coat,"It was exactly what I needed for my dog!! I bought the large since I have a 70 lb. golden retriever (just like the picture).She had lost some hair due to a thyroid condition. So until the medication took effect and her hair grew back, I wanted to make sure she was protected from the cold.The coat is so comfortable; she didn't try to remove it. I will use the coat even when it rains."
4,Great Dog Vest!,It fits my large lab very well! I received the product very promptly too! It is of very good quality. It was just what I wanted..........
3,"Velvet-like material, fits well","I expected this jacket to have a water-resistant outer layer, like a snow jacket, but was very surprised that it felt like velvet instead. It attracts hair and is harder to just wipe away spots. It is not very thick either, but seems to keep my dog warm enough for the short time he is out to use the bathroom. We have not had really cold weather yet, but I will have to buy a warmer coat then. I bought the Large for my 50 lb shepard mix and I do like that the coat goes all the way to his tail. The neck is a little small and I have to have it in the perfect place to close and get the belly strap to close too. The velcro on the belly strap began to come off, but it was an easy fix with the sewing machine. Overall it's ok, but buy something else if you need something really warm."
2,looks great....doesn't stay on,"The price was right, it is fairly well made but it is not designed for a very active dog. Mine will tolerate it for about 30 minutes and then rips it off."
3,"Detailed guide, however if you're looking for a 2000 Mazda Protege guide","Just be sure to note that this is more for the older models that don't come equipped with things such as power sun roof, and it doesn't get into details such as ECU/Diagnostic errors such as the O/D Off blinking"
3,Provides Basic for the DIY Service,"Needed basic information on this car. If you have some basic car repair experience, this guide provides information on the most likely items the owner would be willing to tackle. I still do brake service, spark plug changes, fluid changes and the like, so this guide is just what I needed."
2,ok- Slow,"I like the exercises, but Lynne Robinson does far too much talking and explaining between the exercises. I don't really feel like I am getting a workout. I have done it enough times where now I am just going on to the next one while she is still explaining. I use this in conjunction with the ""Hatha Yoga"" and ""Yoga for the Rest of us""."
4,Great for those of us with a little extra padding,I really enjoy this dvd as it has provided a nice alternative for practicing Pilates. The routine takes into consideration how the body does and does NOT bend/flex for some of us who are not a size 4 or 6. It is nonetheless demanding in that the participant is challenged to be very deliberate in taking on poses.
1,Heh?,"You won't be my Yoko Ono unless I deserve it? You won't gain a career and fame overnight from absolutely nothing? You won't leverage me to the hilt? I don't pretend to understand, but I suppose I'm not empowered enough."
5,I really like this album,"I really like this album. Dar Williams has walked on the folk side of the line between pop and folk, but on The Green World she is firmly walking on top of that fence. Her amazing voice and penetrating lyrics are presented here in a more radio-friendly package, upbeat with more emphasis on full band production than the lonely atmospherics of earlier work. The result is wonderful. Some might say sell out, but what can possibly be better than a pop song that sounds great, feels great, and has some intellectual meat behind it."
5,"Well, I like it...","I'm not sure what all of the complaining is about. I was a little apprehensive about buying this CD after reading some of the initial reviews, but I'm really glad I did! Evolution in style is a necessary component for musicians to keep from becoming stale. Obviously some people just want another Honesty Room or Mortal City. While I'll always treasure those CDs, I'm glad Dar is evolving. I think she's made great strides since End of the Summer and I look forward to what is next. I think people just need to cool off a bit--some of the people who have written reviews seem to be a little possessive over their beloved musicians.... but I can't think of one musician who hasn't evolved over time, for better or for worse. So for the record, buy this CD. If you enjoy it half as much as I do it will be worth the money."
2,"Take it or leave it, really...","Eh. That's about all. Eh. I've been a die-hard Dar fan since I heard her in concert for the first time, a private show at Bryn Mawr College's May Day festivities. But I think I missed something here. I found the production to be very heavy-handed when compared to older Dar, a little more mainstream -- stuff you might hear on the radio in between Celine Dion and Alanis Morrisette. Which is mostly a matter of personal preference. I felt like Dar's voice could have been showcased better, and has always been showcased better with the guitar and a background instrument or two; it seemed to be lost among the support this time around and I felt that her unique voice lost all its power because of this. On the upside, the songwriting was superb and thoughtful. It's listenable, but not superb."
4,Great fun,"Paddy Noonan's band arrangements are delightful - an entire collection of 'party pieces.' This economical set is just the item for a Saint Patrick's Day party or 'home pub'.Many of the recordings are not of true Irish music, but of American composition. Though this could be a plus for a New York party, it could be disappointing to those who are unaware of this. I have seen the Paddy Noonan band in person, and they are more than willing to take requests for everything from traditional ballads to current rallying songs, but most of those on these tracks are far more Ameri-cay than Celtic.The medleys are great fun, and I use this CD as accompaniment for housecleaning - try it, since it tends to remove the drudgery. :)"
2,Not what I expected,"The item intermittently goes out. And one of the microphone covers came apart almost right away. I would have paid a little more for a better set. Amazon sent me a new one right away which was great, hopefully it will be better."
1,waste of money,"Wasn't looking for a top of the line stuff since that would be overly expensive for just home use for karaoke fun once or twice a year. After reading other reviews, thought this system could pass for that, but it is horrible. there is a noticeable delay when the receiver finally picks up the signal from the mics, and the sound is horrible. Sounds muted, and often gives off a strong short annoying sound burst when speaking into the mic with words that starts with certain letters like ""p."" Your lips have to be super close to the mics to even pick up your voice, you basically have to be kissing your mic while singing to pick up your voice, & then the sound that comes out isn't even very good anyway. Want to return it but got busy & didn't get to try it out until a little bit pass the 30 day return policy. My fault for just assuming it would be at least acceptable but it's not even close."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR..,"Overall, product quality is relative to price: see title of this review.The mics feel cheap and light, almost like a cheap chinese remote control toy you expect to break in a couple of weeks. Seeing past aesthetics though, the mics have a terrible pick-up. your mouth needs to be literally 1"" - 1 1/2"" from the receiver to achieve a descent pick up. I understand that this is no SHURE mic system but.. (sigh). The receiver, though not unpleasant to look at, emits an unpleasant and repeated low feedback sound. Thinking it may be a bad cable, we've tried using new cables with the receiver, but the problem persists.On the upside of things, we've learned to adjust the mixer to decrease the disruptive feedback from the receiver, but there's still something there. Will most likely return the mics and spend a few more bucks on a more dependable system."
1,"Unhappy, terrible system","Worked for a little, need to pack paper in the battery area to make it work. Also antennas on mics fall off and mics cut out intermittently. We use this in a church and its never reliable. Also pyle does not stand behind this and during the warranty period we would have to pay for repairs to them and shipping."
4,A great buy but know its limitations,"I purchased this unit to record meetings of my civic association for podcasting. Three of the microphones are rotated in the audience for questions. I had no problems with interference (I am in a major city) but had the base station withing line of sight. The problem I had was that the microphones seem designed for karaoke and must be held in one exact position to properly record. That is, there was no green lights indicating recording levels if not pointed directly at the mouth and held parallel to the breath stream. I changed the gain and that did not seem to matter at all. I boosted the output to 28 out of 32 and used a good recorder that tamped down the excess loudness of those that held it properly and managed to pick up most of the others. So, it worked for my purposes. I cannot imagine it working with live music unless you wanted to isolate just the vocal track."
1,HORRIBLE GUN,"I BOUGHT THIS GUN 2 DAYS AGO AND ITS ALREADY BROKE!first it doesnt have 180fps,more like 20fps.about the second time i cocked it the top part broke off.THIS GUN SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!EVEN FOR THE CHEAP PRICE.IM NOT A NEWB EITHER IVE BEEN PLAYING THIS SPORT FOR ABOUT 4 YEARS.P.S DO NOT BUY CYMA ITEMS THEY ALL SUCK."
4,Good for someone with strong database backgroud........,This book is good for someone with strong Oracle background. If you are a starter and want to get familiar with Oracle 9i then you are better off purchasing Oracle 9i DBA Handbook. You must know all features of Oracle 8i before even thinking about buying this book. Examples and contents in this book are explained very well. I will give this book 4 stars ...
4,Great overview of 9i features,"This book is an excellent overview of the Oracle 9i new features. I would recommend this to DBAs, programmers and the like who would like a concise, high-level overview of the numerous features available in 9i without getting so far into the details that it becomes burdensome to read (that's what manuals are for.)Some of the new features were missing and there were a few mistakes, but I was able to pass the 9i upgrade exam using this book and the SelfTest software. Overall a worthwhile book (the only book as far as I know) for an introduction to the new features of 9i."
1,wrong item being pictured,I would not buy this product as the wrong item is being pictured. I want RxOmega-3 not what is being shown. Can't be sure I would receive the correct product
5,We love it!,"My three month old LOVES this book! The rhyming really catches his attention and he loves to hear my husband and I make the animal noises as we read. It's such a silly book, I don't mind reading it over, and over, and over, and over... I think we like it more than our son!"
1,Ripped off - never received the MP3,"I did everything they asked - I successfully downloaded the MP3 downloader program but the song never downloaded. It is nowhere to be found in my ""Amazon MP3"" folder nor is it anywhere in my computer. But the Amazon website tries to say that I already downloaded it. Looks like I am a last time customer for Amazon MP3; I-Tunes is much much easier to use and I get the song right away every time."
1,Not Lenox Quality,"There is nothing whatsoever petite about this cup and saucer. They are completely full size; that was my first disappointment. There is no reason whatsoever to describe this item as petite. Further they were made in Indonesia, and it shows. The butterfly looks like it was a decal put on the cup, and it didn't completely transfer. The effect is to make the cup look cheap. The blue in the saucer is fairly nondescript, that is sort of blue but leaning towards turquoise. Definitely do not pay the $11 asking price; it is not worth it. Don't even think about giving this as a gift."
4,Great jazz from a great drummer!!,"This is the first and only Art Blakey CD I own. However, based on how good it is, I most definitely plan on getting more. Of course, there is the well loved song ""Moanin'"" with it's sumptous melody. Another favorite off this album is ""Lester Left Town,"" which also has a very cool and catchy melody. The solos off this track are also amazing. The only track not written by a member on this CD is ""A Night in Tunisia"", but the 9+ minute version they play is quite worth it. Art goes nuts near the end and the percussion along with the drums compliment each other well. Another favorite ""Dat Dere"" is well played with impressive trumpet and piano solos. The two extra tracks, ""Mosaic"" and ""Free for All"" are also well welcomed and a nice addition to the already great collection of songs. If you already have most of these songs on other CD's, than this CD is probably not necessary for you, but if you are new to Art Blakey, this is a good place to start!!"
2,Too many writers,"this book obviously has been written by too many people and makes me confuse in transitions from chapter to chapter. I expected this book to give me automated power of Interdev. It, however, shows only a few hand-code examples. I mean, therer are many examples. However, examples are tend to too hand-code side."
1,Another Sams faux pas,"Errors and errors and more errors.There are two things guaranteed if you buy a Sams or Que book. The examples will not work. The authors just type them in, willy-nilly, the publishers take the examples on faith.They cut and paste a proforma Thank You to all the 'hard working' folks who worked on the book.You go out, buy the book, start reading, type in one example, BAAM ! BOOM ! Crash, and another crash.I took the book back to the chain store where I bought and told the buyer to it pull it off the shelf.To my surprise, knowing how little book stores care, all the Sams books dealing with VI were pulled off the shelf."
5,Charlie,I noticed an increase in stamina during physical activity after only a few days of taking Cell food. I intend to order more in the future.
1,"ad does not state ""mini""","Very disappointed to have prodcut arrive only to find out the packaging says ""mini koolatron first alert flashlight"" NO where in the amazon ad does it state that. In fact it states the light is 8 inches long, when in fact it is only 5 inches. Ripoff ! This ad is very misleading !!Then to find out, of course because it is a mini, that the light it provides is not very bright at all.Dont waste your money"
3,Could be excellent.,The concept is good. What makes it only OK is lack of a proofreader. Typos in the print or the diagram are every few pages it seems. I am only partly through the book but a lot of time is spent trying to fathom what the diagram REALLY is or what the print REALLY is trying to say. I don't buy books with that expectation.
5,Great cd,This cd is very easy to listen to. You cant go wrong by buying this cd. I really like it. And well its something everyone can enjoy young or old. Its a great keeper cd.
4,The Story of Human-like Ant Societies For Children,"An animal behavior book for children of 9 give or take a few years, illustrated by the author in black-and-white drawings. The book does a good job of presenting different types of remarkable ant societies: harvesters, farmers, cattle keepers, slave makers, and so on. The author doesn't clutter the text with scientific detail. The presentation is an analogy to human societies."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The movie can feel a bit unstructured, but it's a fantastically enjoyable depiction of Britain's home front with a corker of an ending and not a boring moment in the too-brief running length; it's not spoken of much anymore but that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it."
5,A poetic look at WW II,"This film,together with Louis Malle's Au revoiir les enfants,is one of the best look at WW II seen through the eyes of children.It captures the spiret and mood of war time Britain in a marvelously poetic way.The last ""thank you Adolf""scene is unforgettable."
4,A worthwhile read,"Easy reading, entertaining, interesting and informative. Light on details but a very good general overview of the topic.Conceptually excellent. The value is in how you implement the recommendations - which is where you will find this book wanting.If you get nothing else out of this book, the quote from Dee Hock (founder of Visa) will make it worth buying:""Hire and promote first on the basis of integrity; second motivation; third capacity; fourth understanding; fifth knowledge; and last and least, experience.Without integrity, motivation is dangerous; without motivation, capacity is impotent; without capacity, understanding is limited; without understanding, knowledge is meaningless; without knowledge, experience is blind."""
2,Rubber bands,"This cd player didnt skip while i was running, but the latch that keeps it closed broke off and i had to wrap a rubber band around it to keep it closed. This also happened to a buddy of mine, and a few other people i spoke to who bought this same cd player at the PX."
3,"Not ""all the best"", just some of it","Although this collection serves as something of overview of the greatest jazz pianist who ever lived, it is not a set that captures all of his finest performances. As an introduction to Powell, it is rather limp. About a third of it is immortal. The rest? Too many above-average selections from his 1950s Blue Notes, which were sporadically nice, sometimes off, only sometimes great, and important for students and chroniclers of his life. For the true best of Bud Powell, you have to be more diligent. Start with the 1949-1951 Verve trios (""Jazz Giant"") and 1940s Roost trios (included in ""Complete Roost and Swing Sessions"", and ""Bud's Bubble""), work your way down to the ""Amazing Bud Powell"" vols. 1 and 2. Or if you can afford it, go for the box sets (""Complete Bud Powell on Verve"", ""Complete Blue Note"", etc.) Anything after 1954 is a different, pared down Bud Powell."
2,Son was not impressed,My 5 year old son loves monster trucks. He has other monster jam videos that he loves to watch. He hated this one. It's just a bunch of quick clips with a lot of talking in between. Definitely not what we expected. Waste of money for us.
3,A Consistent Read,"You either like Robert B. Parker's writing style, or you don't. He does. This Jesse Stone novel is consistent. It is the usual Parker mix of tight plotting and snappy dialogue, with a nice twist at the end. I won't spoil it for you, but you will breathe a sigh of relief if you've been following this series. Parker follows his time honored formula that began so long ago with the original Spencer novel and has served him well over the thirty or so years he's been a major league mystery writer. I find that you don't read a Parker novel for the plot, but for the ongoing character development, watching the characters grow emotionally from one outing to the next. Night and Day is another solid, although not spectacular, effort from the pen of Boston's most famous mystery writer. A fast read."
3,Good but not great,"I like Jesse, but Night and Day is thin on details and reads like a screenplay instead of a novel, and could go right to TV production without much re-write; and that's not something we should expect from a novel.If you liked the other Jesse Stone novels you'll like this one. However, RBP needs to stop phoning in his novels and put one together that we can really sink our teeth into !"
1,Parker can do better,"As a devoted Robert Parker Jr fan, I thought this was a sub-standard offering. It looked like a minimum effort on the part of the author and no effort on the part of the editor. I was particulary upset with the dialogue and the ""he said-she said"" additions to the end of each sentence, even in a two party dialogue. It was as if the author was being paid by the word (which maybe he was-since the plot is more fitting for a short story). I agree with most reviewers that best that can be said for this book is we may have seen the last of Jenn. I recommend that you wait and buy this one when it's on the sale table."
5,Robert Parker is my favorite author - I love all his books.,"This book was as good as others. I won't reveal the ending, but those of us who think Jesse is wasting his time with Jen got happy!"
2,Robert Parker Night and Day,Printed very poorly with missing pages and smeared print. The story is fine but the book is a last class printing job..
3,Just so-so..............,"I'm a big Parker fan (Spenser more than Stone or Randall), but this was not my favorite. Like others, I've had enough of the ex-wife, but he does make her go away.........let's hope it's permanent! I was happy, however, that there were educational issues addressed here; as a long-time middle school teacher, I can tell you that we are now charged with teaching everything from manners to morality, and that's wrong. I also still admire Parker's wit -- he's great at poking fun or making a point in a sly and entertaining way.I actually ran across this book in my public library (my lucky day!) and though I normally buy all of this author's book and then pass them on to my 31 year old son and my 84 year old dad, I'm glad that I didn't pay for this one. Good beach reading, I guess, but that's about it."
5,This album IS complete - 20 songs!,"Several people complained that several songs are missing: King Porter Stomp, Moonglow, and Sing,Sing,Sing. To end the confusion, those titles are included on the next Goodman CD - ""Mr. Benny Goodman, Benny Goodman Story"", (""The Green Album"") released by Capitol in 1955. The original B.G. In Hi-Fi lp had 12 songs on it, the 45 ep's had more. This Cd has 20 songs on it, which includes previously unissued recordings. My recommendation is to purchase the Green album along with this one, and it will complete Goodman's 1954-55 Capitol series. You shouldn't be disappointed.The Benny Goodman Story"
4,Critique of cost-benefit analysis for environmental matters,"Prof. Sagoff demonstrates the problematic nature of an economic approach to environmental decisionmaking. Even granting that we could quantify environmental values in dollar terms, he raises the important question of why we would want to do such a thing. The author argues that questions of balancing environmental values against other ""goods"" should be decided in the public political arena, and not by reference to people's private willingness to pay. Somewhat puzzling is Sagoff's adherence to a utilitarian philosophy; I'm still waiting for someone to point out the obvious liberty and distributive-justice problems with cost-benefit analysis in the sphere of environmental regulation."
4,sherlock holmes - the scarlet claw,"Very pleased with product. Haven't seen this episode in a while, very enjoyable."
4,Holmes and Watson try to solve the case of 'La Morte Rouge',"This 1944 entry in this beloved film series is perhaps the best of the lot (certainly the best of the contemporary [1940's] set Universal films). Holmes and Watson find themselves involved in the mystery of 'La Morte Rouge' (was Lady Penrose the victim of a supernatural monster, or was her throat ripped out by an ogre of the human variety?) in this brilliantly eerie suspense drama. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are their usual wonderfully cast selves and are matched by a marvellous supporting cast. Directed by Holmes veteran Roy William Neill, the film has a great, suspenseful (naturally) climax that may surprise the most adept Holmes fans (provided they haven't seen it before!). My only complaint is (as with all of this series) at a mere 70 minutes it is over all too soon."
3,Too big,"This bag was way too big for me. If you need to carry a 17"" laptop in it, then it will be great for you. Otherwise, I'd recommend something smaller. I have returned mine and done exactly that."
2,This is best cookbook I ever owned!!!,"I have a ton of cookbooks and enjoy them all. But this cookbook is fun and the receipes are quick and inexpensive to prepare. It gives you neat ideas whether you are preparing brunch, lunch, or dinner. I have one that I bought several years ago when my children were younger. They would always use this cookbook, because the receipes are so simply and easy to follow. So if getting in and out if the kitchen ""quick"" is your idea of fast food, try this book!"
4,Where the Veronica Mars support cast ended up...,"...which is not a bad thing by any means. It takes a couple of episodes to get the gist of the short,punchy episodes (similar to Arrested Development in this way) but after a few shows, you will be hooked. A great motley bunch of characters, and if you love Jane Lynch in Glee, check out the other more manic side to her personality in this show. This is a tad like Clerks for the catering industry, but each show is so full of cameos from huge actors, it is impossible not to love it. Another great series from Rob Thomas, whose work is completely underrated in America."
3,"Fun, but repetitive","The show starts off pretty well, but it gets old very quickly. Not too much new is happening, and a few of the characters are just not very interesting. Good concept and worth watching, but it could have been so much better."
4,Right On The Mark,"This book took my breath away and knotted mt stomach. I know it's a ""novel,"" but if it wasn't so obviously ""crafted"" you could have fooled me. I've never encountered anything in this genre set mostly in the Middle East that captured so well the nuance in the people and cultures there. John Ratti's vision looks and feels too real but I hope what he sees for the future isn't. His hero, Army Captain Kasey Lawrence, is sent, with little preparation, on a grinding, twisting, revealing journey with a Saudi prince who is an Air Force captain. I really liked how Honor Bound contrasted their interpretations of what they were experiencing ... that was quite enlighteneing. And I especially liked Ratti's intestinal fortitude as a writer; he took his story to a place very risky to go for the usual audience a book of this kind strives to reach. If you read this book, you won't forget it."
1,Lacking Depth,"While set in 1880's Omaha at the beginning or the city's life, I never felt a part of the historical setting. The detail is vague, the characters are wooden, inauthentic or stereotypical bad guys. The plot twists are contrived and the love story (as such) leaves me cold. Perhaps if the novel had been spun out for another hundred pages, I might have felt more interest. This was definitely a gloss over novel meant to fill only the strict page guidelines of Naiad Press. I am disappointed as I liked many of the author's earlier works."
4,"Not bad, but can stand some improvement","""You get what you pay for"" pretty much sums up my review. The cord storage device works as advertised and I am satisfied with it, considering what I paid for it. If you are going to be storing 100-ft. of electrical extension cord, this adds up to a significant weight that the device has to 'carry' and you have to hold while rolling the cord around the device (reel). There is a handle for one to hold, but when nearing the end of the 100-ft cord, you will notice the device flexes and it is difficult to hold with one hand while reeling (ergonomic factor). For improvement, I think the manufacturer should strenghten the device in places that would minimize flex and improve comfort during use. There are not too many products available on line that serve this purpose and have this design/function. Perhaps competition could drive improvement of this type of product."
3,"Lovely collages, but limited story. Adults can remember early 1980s New York City","Artist Jeannie Baker is a talented artist whose appealing collages are made with great talent and care. Her story is only lightly connects the artworks together. I find the story more compelling for adults than for children. My six year old girl took scant interest in the book. Rather, I was the one who enjoyed more the trip back to New York City in the early 1980s: the graffiti, the roller skaters, the boomboxes, the buildings, the assorted characters. Thus I think that this book has become more a souvenir of a bygone age, than a book for children. If you remember, and want to revisit, early 1980s New York then this book of lovely collages is for you."
3,"Decent flashlight, needs D batteries","What can I say, it's a Flashlight! It arrived on time, it was packaged well. I was disappointed that it takes size D batteries. I keep every size of battery stocked in my kitchen, except D batteries. So now I have to make a separate trip to the store and buy size D batteries just for this flashlight. Oh well. I should have inquired before I purchased. Otherwise it seems fine."
3,"They should rethink their ""krypton bulb""","When I put batteries into this Rayovac, I was very unpleasantly surprised at how dim it was. Tried a different set of batteries, still dim. Then I cannibalized the bulb from the broken inexpensive Garrity flashlight that I was replacing. Much brighter. So much for the impressive-sounding krypton bulb concept.Even after the bulb swap, this flashlight was not as bright as the old Garrity. My guess is that the Rayovac's reflector design is also inadequate. As cheap as this thing is, it still is not worth its price."
2,Nice beginning... overall.. a disaster,"The DVD skips... for starters.An initial nice, narrative journey turns into a showcase for two effete snobs who 'lord over' what should be a pleasant excursion. Also, the DVD does not begin in Saigon, but distal from there. I have been to Saigon...and the Mekong. This is a major disappointment.Seek something better."
1,"Not science, just fiction","The srory is about a future space expedtion sent to a planet lightyears away to investigate the loss of contact with the earlier colony ship. the crew find the earlier colonists living in a world based around a medieval painting depicting heaven and hell.the plot is not convincing, it is obvious the author is trying to deal with the inconsistencies in the christian doctrine by supeimposing it on a science fiction background, alas he is not successful. besides, There are no new ideas here at all.If you are looking for science fiction, dont read this one."
2,Not a helpful book,a terrible book for self-study. may be good as a class companion where the teacher explains a lot. but the author does not approach linear algebra in an pedagogical way that enables self-study. solutions for exercises come out of the blue of the sky. also errors found.
1,Wrong Book,"My son asked me to order this book for him, but it is not what it appeared to be. It only has test questions & answers. We were needing the TEXT BOOK. Then, I ordered another one with TB at the end, again, wrong book as TB stands for Test Bank, and only has suggested questions for tests but not the TEXT BOOK I thought I was ordering. Am at a loss, as I have spent almost $100 and still have not what I need, the TEXT BOOK."
2,Lovely melodies and spiritual inspiration,"Krishna Das' album ""Pilgrim Heart"" is a beautiful ripple of Hindu chants, set to somewhat modern music mixed with traditional Indian classical instruments. Mostly, Das uses ancient Hindu chants again and again and again as his ""lyrics."" The effect is quite soothing, and spiritual. The duet with Sting, for example, is quite nice, and it's fusion of a Hindu chant with ""Amazing Grace"" is an accomplished blend of pieties. However, having heard other works by Das, I was disappointed at the redundancy of most of the songs on the album. For the most part, this album never (shall we say) transcends the ""new age"" or ""Hindu"" categories of music. And that's all right--if it's what you're looking for."
5,Very nice product. well manufactured perfect fit.,Excellent product so far. finish is excellent and went on without a hitch. Quite a robust disk set that I suspect are better than OEM from Mazda for 1/2 the price. Could be better packed though.
4,Good value and not bad looking either,"My old coffee table was about to collapse, so I decided I needed a new one. After looking around, and finding a lot outside of my price range I stumbled across this one, at a very reasonable price. How could I go wrong? The table itself is surprisingly solid (and has no scratches btw), and although the legs need attaching (by the normal bolt to bracket type) they also seem solid, because it uses 2 bolts per leg. THis was why my last table did not last, so I'm pleased to see the extra strength this will provide. The table also looks pretty good. The dark wood is elegant, and although the little chrome pieces seem a bit cheap and tacky, they are actually hidden away, so that unless you're lying on the floor, you really wouldn't notice them at all.So overall, a good price for a decent table."
3,It is pretty good...,"But it did not keep the kids entertained as much as I thought it would. I had them from 4-8 years old, and not one was totally enthralled with it. It was just OK, the best thing about it was that it is actually a G rated one, they are getting hard to find!"
3,Circus World,As a die hard John Wayne fan. I will take what I can get. I am still hoping for a US release with all the bells and whistles.
1,Better than no copy at all,"The copy of Circus World I had taped off the air more than 15 years ago was really starting to wear out and I was really glad to find this DVD. When I got it, I noticed the Chineese text underneath all of the English on the cover. I found the DVD had sub-titles you couldn't turn off, only an OK picture and sound that was out of phase. At times the audio sounded like it was at the bottom of a barrel. Since I can't find anything better out there, I'll keep it, but ""let the buyer beware"" on this one. It's really only better than no copy at all of what is otherwise a really good John Wayne movie."
5,Great,I purchased the movie for my father who is an avid John Wayne fan and had never seen this particular movie.
3,Good movie,"States english subtitles are optional, but there are only korean and japanese subtitles available on the disc. Very disappointed afterall."
5,Excellent buy,"The copy of Circus World I bought was sold by KNS MEDIA and was the cheapest version I could find. It is from a Korean distributor, but the print is wonderful with sharp colors in a widescreen format. The audio is in English. Aside from a few Korean characters on the cover, you wouldn't even know it is an import. And hey, it's a John Wayne movie that is hard to find otherwise. Although maybe not the Duke's very best, it is quite good and worth the price."
2,I never expected this from her,"Wow, I would never have expected this kinda of story from Jayne Castle. I really love her work in all of her incarnations so I was really surprised by this story. The guy was a little too macho and the female character a little too the little woman(literally). She had spunk but ended up always going his way. I really got pissed at this one. Although it wasn't as bad as Bargain with the Devil in one scene it was almost a date rape.Word to the wise be careful when reading her earlier works. It will make you pissed off and wanting to yell. That being said it was a well written story just really annoying characters"
2,Fictional History,"It is speculation based on some history. While it does relate the tensions, the history itself is sufficient to present the case for the white invasion and destruction of a people."
1,Not worth the time...,"If you're looking for some decent historical fiction, keep looking unless you like shallow, stereotyped, obnoxious characters, wooden dialogue that reads like it was written by a talented child, and completely implausible plotlines.A 70 year old man slavishly taking orders from a bratty 16 year old girl? Another man falling wildly in love with her after having known her only for a few hours (during which time she behaves like a complete jerk) and having absolutely nothing in common with her? Give me a break. The characters that weren't actively obnoxious were either weak and wishy washy (Mark, William, Caroline) or preachy (Eliza, Victoria). They were all so unlikeable I found myself wishing they'd all gone down with the ship, including the ones who stayed on shore.Ms. Price seemed to have done a good job researching the period and the historical descriptions are well done. Unfortunately this doesn't make up for the book's other major flaws."
3,One REALLY fatal flaw!,"I have recently discovered Eugenia Price's fiction and have read all of her novels except the Savannah Quartet, which I am making my way through now. However, I almost couldn't push myself through this second book because of the insufferable behavior of Natalie Browning, who, unfortunately, is the main character. When I encountered her as a small child in book one and saw the way her parents spoiled her, I figured there was going to be trouble in book two, and I was right. She has GOT to be the most obnoxious, self-centered, egotistical, impulsive and, at the same time, flat out stupid heroine ever for a book. But all is forgiven because of her incredible beauty. I know Ms. Price doesn't have to worry about sales of this book at this point, but I just had to get this off my chest! I will finish the set because I love historical fiction that is so accurate and so factually based and well researched, but I'll be rolling my eyes an awful lot and taking frequent breaks!"
2,Musty is the key word for this tea,"The description states that this tea has a ""pronounced musty character,"" and they're not kidding! Perhaps my palate is not yet delicate enough to appreciate Pu-erh, or this tea is not representative of others out there, but my experience with this particular sample was that I could have thrown some dirt and/or compost in the teapot and achieved a similar flavor. Not for the faint of heart!"
2,Wprst Pills/Best Piills,"This book is very informative regarding different pharmaceutical drugs and their possible side effects, etc. My only complaint is that it is not completely up to date. I found that several items I wanted to look up were not in this issue."
4,staying safe,Everyone should have this book to check medications they are given. I was at a major hospital in Arizona and they gave me a dangerous pill the World Health Organization said should never be used. I got a safe pill instead.
4,"So far, so good","As with anything new, this will take a lot of time and perseverence, but a good tool to begin with."
2,"Works, but hazardous","The label tells you not to get this product on your skin. They are not kidding! The product is a liquid, not a gel, so it's easy to accidentally splash yourself when you squirt it on. I made the mistake of getting some on my hands, and although I washed them immediately with soap, it burned like crazy and it bleached the color out of my skin. Two of my fingers are noticeably lighter than the rest of my hand. It works well, but I wouldn't use it again without rubber gloves. My guess is this is why they aren't marketing it anymore.The old Spray N Wash solid stick worked just as well and wasn't nearly as caustic. Not sure why they stopped making that one, but it's still available online."
2,"FBI ""Premium Quality?"" Hat","I was excited about receiving this item because it was unlike any other FBI hat I have seen. There were minor details about the hat that made it appealing to me. So, like any person looking for an FBI hat, I bought one. When I got the hat it was not unlike any other hat I had seen. It was the same as all the other FBI hats on Amazon and Ebay. The picture of the item was different than the one I actually received. Subtle differences, but the subtle differences were the reason I wanted the hat in the first place...it was a little different. The seller has since changed the picture in the item description to match the one I received. I ended up returning it because it wasn't like the one in the picture and the embroidery on the front was unraveling. Premium Quality? Not quite. Overall the seller was cooperative and I got my refund."
1,Garbage,"I work for a school district and we have a school full of these and at least 1/3 of them (so far, new ones come in all the time) eat tapes and/or have dvd reading problems.A few have had power supply issues as well. The tape eating is fixable by a tech (ME), and is due to some cheap plastic parts. This is what we have now thanks to the consumer market valuing ""Cheap"" over ""Quality"". some have worked well enough for the last 3 years, but a lot of them died right after the warranty period. We have had great results with Samsung LCD TV's and Displays, but I don't know if I'[d buy another DVD/VCR combo from them. Incidentally I have one at home (different model though) and it works well enough, but I rarely use it so who knows?I'd give this model zero stars if it were possible."
3,Nothing like Draconian Times,"Simply put, Believe in Nothing is a mediocre album. It basically sounds like a rehashed Host with heavier guitars. It does nothing to match the intensity of Icon, The driving force of Draocnian Times or the gothic beauty of One Second. It is an improvement on Host however, so having said that, its worth a listen or two."
3,We thought it so strange that we made a video of a reading of the book for a friend across the country,"Our 18 month old daughter received this book as a gift. It's cute through most of the book with simple, bold illustration. The pages are thick cardboard that will last quite a while through many readings.However, the ending was a surprise. We found it puzzling and funny at the same time. We decided to share it with a friend of ours who lives 1700 miles away.This video will give you a great look at the quality and surprise ending of the book:[...]"
3,They work OK Until,"I've purchased 15-20 of these and they work fine until (This is my best guess) the TSA opens them too many times. Then they loose the combination and can't be opened again, then you must cut them off."
3,"Good overview, Bad editing","This book gives a comprehensive overview of IPSec and is certainly a better starting point than the original RFCs with their courier fonts, ascii graphics, and twisty mazes of footnotes. But you can only have so much overview before getting to the details. At that point, I suggest you go back to the RFCs: they are better written, contain fewer errors, and have a subtle sense of humor almost makes them fun to read.This book seems to be the best available now, but it needs extensive editing and restructuring to make it a really good book. You'll probably want to get the ""Big Book of IPSec RFCs"" to go with it."
2,Good for general fitness but not so good for softball,"Length:: 6:17 MinsTo all softball players, coaches and parents:In this video review, I explained that I'm very qualified to review this product and why I strongly believe that this book is not specific enough for softball players and is better suited for the general population.Reviewer's credentials:- Experienced Softball Coach (over 20 years of softball coaching experience including the international and college levels)- Certified Strength and Conditioning Coach (over 10 years of experience training and conditioning softball players)"
5,Exactly what I needed to get in shape for softball,"Let's face it, I'm a soft lump right now and 10 weeks away I start my 3rd season of softball (co-ed work league). Last year I was fat, slow, had a mediocre to poor season AND pulled a hammy during play offs. Since then I gained 10 lbs.So I looked around the net for some tips to get in back shape for my July season. Found this great book and am loving it.It has the much needed off season and pre season programs as well as in-season. The part I like the most is it gives substitution exercises in case you can't do what they recommend (like dips for me).Has all the good tips for proper technique, chaging things up and how to train best specificaly the muscles for playing softball. I see this book being great for people in serious leagues to beer drinking big guys like myself who are looking to get back to our 25 year old shape (10 years ago) and show some of the guys I'm not just a funny benchwarmer this year.Very happy with this purchase."
5,QUICK service and good packaging!,Item was in perfect condition. Service was on timely manner. Thanks!!
5,"Thanks, Mark","Thanks, Mark, for writing this beautiful testimony of your lovely, sainted wife. I was priviledged to have Mev in my life when we taught together at Viz. I traveled with her as we took students to Mexico. Mev inspired so many of us, she was a remarkable gift from God, full of spirit and energy, she was luminous. I will cherish this book, just as I cherish my photos she took, the books and articles she wrote, her video and the letters and articles I saved over the years from her, as she went out to witness for peace and justice in our world. Thanks Mark for keeping her memory alive and sharing it with us. This book is a beautiful reflection of her life and her work. It will inspire others and forever comfort those of us who knew Mev."
5,Meditation,"The unique life of one woman is celebrated through the eyes of her grieving husband and friends. A story of love and struggle told through a collection of reflections, letters, poems, interviews, and photographs. The format makes as much sense as life and death would ever make, but it allows for an intimate, panoramic view of the human experience, so much so that the experience of one man and one woman could easily become the experience of every man and every woman.When you read this book read it slowly. It will open doors into your own soul and connect you to the world... like meditation."
5,The Book of Mev,"This is a book to linger with and to be touched deeply by the open, revealing approach to the life of this acclaimed photojournalist. An unusual format only enhances the book's content. Knowing Mev and her spiritual journey as deeply as I did, I find myself reading slowly, savoring once again the beauty of this woman, even as her spirit was honed by the suffering she entered into with the poorest of the poor, and her resolve to tell their stories to the world. Told by her husband, this writing is a beautiful tribute to Mev's life; it is also a window on the relationship which grew between them as it was forged by faith, blossomed into marriage, and gave them strength to face and to accept together the brevity of their shared life and the untimely death of Mev. This rich book evinces a closeness with God that is tried by fire."
3,OK - but do not read unless you're a Democrat,"The book was ok, a typical journal of a new mother's first year with her son. What I did NOT appreciate were the many ""horrible"" thoughts she wrote about what would happen if her son grew up to be a Republican. I guess it was supposed to be humorous, but I am an Independent and still found that to be insulting. Get another new mommy's journal account of her first year, I'm sure there are others..."
5,This should be mandatory reading for EVERY teenager!,"When I say EVERY I mean men and women. They might think once or a thousand times before deciding not to use birth control.... What I admired about Anne Lamott's journal was her complete honesty. Giving birth and raising a child is no walk in the park, despite what all those baby shampoo commercials would have us believe. Anne was lucky in the fact that she had loving friends and family, which helped compensate for the fact that the man who helped create Sam skipped out on her. (All you studly teen-age men out there, can you say ""CHILD SUPPORT? "" I knew that you could.) I hope A. Lamott never stops writing. She's a brave woman in this increasingly chaotic world."
5,A Must Even for Non-Moms,"Those of us who have yet to be mothers may be turned off by the subject of Operating Instructions, but I can assure you that Lamott can delight Moms and non-Moms alike. She writes with brutal honesty about the times she hated her son. She shares thoughts that most of us have about friends, ourselves, etc. but don't dare admit to. Plus, the book is laugh out loud funny. The short entires make for quick reading because there's always a good stopping point, although if you're like me, you'll find you want to read just one more."
1,Politics a big part of this book!,"I received this book as a gift. I don't think the giver knew his audience very well. I was intending to read a similar book to ""The Zygote Chronicles,"" which I WOULD recommend. This book was more about her expressing her political views than about taking you through her thoughts with her son. I found myself trying to skip around to find the information about him and not about her ranting on about how Republicans are evil and convincing her son of the same. I was sorely disappointed in this book. From someone who is coming up to motherhood in a very conservation and traditional way, this was quite offensive. However, I know that some might find this amusing. I sent it to a friend that might think differently than I did."
2,Not Her Best,"I think she is an amazing author, but I just couldn't buy into this one. It just felt so narcissistic to me (obviously it's a memoir, but even at that, it just felt so completely over the top that I just couldn't stomach it). She has such amazing thoughts on faith and God, it just makes you want to write them all down and keep her quotes in your pocket. But then she gets started on tangents (and language) and she loses my interest, because I know she can do better (and has: Traveling Mercies and Bird by Bird are both works that I really enjoyed). So, I'll give Grace (Eventually) a shot, if nothing else but for the amazing spirituality (and quotes that I will keep in my pocket for a rainy day)."
4,Essential reading for parents to be,"As a soon-to-be dad, I found this book eye-opening. A refreshing change from all those sweet, bubbly memoirs on parenting. I've always felt equipped to nurture a child, but until I read this book, I had no idea just how much that child might nurture me."
4,Minor Crime Classic,"This was Joe Gores' first published book (he had previously worked writing biographies of generals for the military -- ! -- and as a PI in S.F. for 12 years), but he was 38 when it came out, which may explain its antipathy to youth.It's in the same genre as ""Death Wish"", ""Straw Dogs"", ""Last House on the Left"", etc. A professor who has a secret past as an SAS commando seeks revenge from some punks for the death of his wife. He's somewhat ambivalent about his wife in the first place, which robs the revenge tale of some of its urgency but makes it perhaps more realistic. What makes the book a bit dated is its somewhat bizarre sexual politics that feel very much of the era, or maybe even slightly earlier. Still, it's a fast, fun, suspenseful read. Crime fiction completists won't want to miss it, and everybody else will enjoy it too. I liked it slightly less than ""Interface,"" which Gores wrote a couple of years later."
2,Kindle edition faulty!,A very entertaing book for skeptics and fans of the paranormal. The entries are full of gltiches where bits of entries appear scrambled in different places-so an entry might contain half the next of another entry
1,A poor attempt at unfounded conjecture,"It seems that none of the articles have any substance in undermining the topics they attack. For example, Uri Geller, who has proved his ESP in labs worldwide, is simply poo-pooed without contradicting scientific example. This is hardly skepticism; it is simply automatic gainsay. I'm sorry but this book was a real disappointment. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BY BUYING IT."
1,critical but unthinking,"A quote from Robert Todd Carroll:""A delusion held by one person is a mental illness, held by a few is a cult, held by many is a religion.""Source: http://www.skepdic.com/cults.html"
4,Great Book for a Look at China Past and Present,"I came across this book while going through a box of my grandmother's old books. What a find! As a student of Asian History, I found it fascinating and can't believe that I never read this while majoring in Asian Studies (shame on you San Diego State!). It is very well written and a true asset to anyone studying China's past and what lead up to the Coummunist revolt."
3,In search of history,"The book is one of White's first and surely not his best.still he has a nack for making hsitory in his storytelling. The books was controversial and a best seller in its time, fur shure. For those interested it is still the best picture of America in wartime China that I know, but I don't know. White's great point that all communists were not the same, is first made here. and if he would have made it better or someone up there had listened the world would have been differnt, but it was 1946. some how I think that In search of History is a better book, but I cant find a copy, and White had had 30 years to think about it. and make the plot a little thicker. again not White at his best but certainly his first and most important work."
3,7 minutes!,"Before you buy this video. I just want you to know the ""workout"" is only SEVEN MINUTES LONG! The rest of the dvd is watching andrea lin talk about her ""method"". Talking about how dressing sexy will help you lose weight by boosting your confidence . Then there is a short tutorial. This is NOT workout dvd. Its a dvd that teaches you one simple dance routine."
2,DECENT COMPILATION BUT GOOD SONGS ARE MISSING,First of all it's the only Led Zep compilation. All the tracks out there are excellent but those songs are defintively missing:- Heartbreaker- Thank you- Moby Dick- Tangerine- Going to California- The Rain Song- Over The Hills and Far Away- D'Yer Mak'er- In The Light- For Your Life
1,Waste of $,"Doesn't insulate at all. Sorry I wasted my money, so you should save yours. Try another brand is you need one."
1,HORRIBLE product,"This product is terrible!! I was so excited at the thought of not having to shave, so I read lots of positive reviews and then went out and bought some for myself. I got them at Walgreens for $8. I let my hair grow to a proper length for waxing and then I read the directions VERY carefully. And I followed the directions VERY carefully!! These things suck. They hardly removed any hair and left wax behind. So I had to wipe the spots I waxed with those wipes and now my calves look like they have razorburn! Ugh I'm SO disappointed!! I tried all kinds of tricks to get these things to work. I warmed them up with my hair dryer for a few seconds instead of my hands to make sure that the wax was warm and that did nothing. I tried everything. No matter how concisely I followed the directions I got very poor results. DO NOT waste your money!! Total rip off."
3,Slow...,"I have been reading through this book slowly, it just doesn't give me enough to get me to just sit down for hours with it. This would be a good book; it's got great things to say, but it is quite slow at getting out what few points it does have on it's many pages. I'd love a condensed version. Over all it's okay.Still I have found nothing to top Self Editing for Fiction Writers. If you are looking for a book on writing take a look at that too!"
1,something inside,"I found a peace of slim plastic inside when I was taking the amount I needed for my shake. I was lucky that I looked inside it before putting it in the blender. Imagine what could have happened If that peace of plastic gets inside the blender and then inside my stomach.I am going to use an strainer any time I use it, and I do not think I am going to get the same product in the future."
4,Classic Blues & Jazz Lovers - Yule enjoy this Compilation,"This is a jazzy blues yuletide compilation with classic jazz artists such as Chet Baker, Count Basie and Dexter Gordon playing some traditional holiday favorites. In addition, two versions of an original Thelonious Monk composition called ""A Merrier Christmas"" are also included. Contemporary jazz artists such as John Scofield and Benny Green also perform some compositions and vocal tracks by Lou Rawls and Dianne Reeves further add to the overall diversity of this compilation.For those who can appreciate a more melancholic blend of yuletide jazz & blues, this is a great addition to the holiday collection."
3,OK pan but arrived damaged,"The pan by itself is OK but arrived in a badly damaged condition (several big dents in the bottom); hence the rating. Decided to keep it as we needed it that weekend, and would probably get more dents after the first use. However, one expects a better condition from a $20-something pan."
5,MSR 1.6L StowAway Pot,"Great pot for 2 people, or one course of a meal with more in your group. I have used the 1.6 liter pot for close to 3 years on every backpacking trip I have taken. Fried chorizo and eggs and/or potatoes for breakfast, made coffee with out a filter (splash an ounce or two of cold water, after getting the desired color in the boiling coffee, to get the grounds to settle), made mashed potatoes or instant refried beans and boiled fresh vegetables. The lid has been used for prep work (as a cutting board) for most meals while camping.The locking lid is nice to keep delicate things from being crushed or broken in your pack, or you can keep some of the eating utensils/ spices in it."
5,Great Pot,"This is a sweet little pot. Fits in my tiny pack, and holds all the food i'll need for an over night back country trip. It's also super light which is nice for hiking but you have pay attention so as not to burn your food. Also the handle is awesome and super stable for pouring."
2,"Is this product supposed to be ""made in china""?","Overall, the product is very cheap sounding.You get what you pay for.The only thing that concerns me is, is this product supposed to be made in china?There was no authenticity form or sticker with the product."
5,Doan's extra strength pain reliever,This ia a product we have been using for many years for back pain after excessive activity. We were having trouble finding them anymore at our grocery store and drug stores. We found them on Amazon and decided to order a couple of boxes. These will last us a while and hope we can find them on Amazon when again needed.
4,One of the best stories of its kind.,"No Blade of Grass is story of an agricultural experiment gone totally awry. It attacks all grain like produce(oats, wheat, alphalfa, etc)and kills them without mercy. When the worlds best can't stop it and panic across the world becomes the norm. The story ends up following a group of people who join together to reach a farm in Ireland that grows potatoes, one of the crops not affected by the grass killer. I highly recomend this story for anyone who likes good scifi and human conflict tales. I read this book when I was freshman in high school at the behest of my father. And though I resisted at first I grew to like this book as I contiued to read it. This is a book no personal library should be without,"
5,BioCase Works Perfectly!,"My West Highland Terrier has EPI and has been on enzyme replacement for 6 years. He's done very well on another product and I was reluctant to switch him to anything else, knowing how sick he might potentially become. However, the price of his enzymes has become more and more expensive, so I started looking for a more affordable alternative.The one review on this product was positive, so I decided to give BioCase a try. My dog is doing fabulously on it. He suffered no ill effects when I switched him to it and has not had a single problem since. He also seems to be eating with more gusto, his coat has lost its perpetual greasiness, and his breath has become much more tolerable. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
1,Useless,I tried this on a heavily soiled (not rusted)tub. I had previously used other products with limited success. This product had the same effect as spraying plain water on the tub. I even used a sponge to scrub along with the product. NOTHING was removed. The product is totally worthless. The manufacturer should be ashamed.
1,Shying away from Microsoft,"After being a hardcore Microsoft user for years and years, I've recently discovered a whole new world through the GNU/Linux platform. Windows users -- go to www.openoffice.org. Download the FREE software, which is fully compatible with Microsoft formats, and if this doesn't do the job, then you can shell out $300+ for the traditional product."
1,2003 Office upgrade,"If you are primarily a Word and Excel user, this upgrade is just not worth it. In fact, I find the typical autocorrect-type (assumes the programmer knows better than you how you want to format your document) additions more annoying than improvements to the program. This is overall a very good package, but I just wish Microsoft would leave it alone."
3,Could be a lot better,"The book is ok as a rough guide/what to look outbut for something simple e.g. instructions for simplechange of a front headlamp the book indicated total removalof the headlamp unit on my '98 A4. Fortunately Iremembered to the dealership service advice thatI simply had to pop off a plastic cap behind theheadlamp, undo a clip, unplug the old bulb and replaceit - took less than 5 minutes - good thing I did notfollow the book!Overpriced too."
3,"Good, but not complete","I bought this guide specifically to replace an oxygen sensor in the car. While this book is full of loads of good information on my car, they only had the location of the sensor for the other models, so I still don't know where to find mine. So while it looks useful, it didn't accomplish the first task I bought it for."
5,Excellent Solution to a Common Problem.,Very easy to program to the vehicle. The vehicle I bought did not come with a keyfob. The instruction sheet that is included worked perfectly and I had it programmed in about a minute including reading the instructions. 2004 Ford Excursion XLT The fob itself is brand new and works fine. Operated it from inside my house to the vehicle parked in the driveway. Best 3 dollars I ever spend.
5,Key remote,Same remote as factory. I called 800 number for assistance programming my new remote. I had my remote programmed in minutes. Excellent product and fantastic customer service.
5,three button remote control,I m very happy to get this three button remote control. It is very simple to program for my 2000's F150 truck. Fast shipping and affordable for a replacement of lost one. Thanks.
1,will lock but not unlock,The battery it came with was weak so I put another battery and I got through the programing stage. I wa able to get it to unlock the door but not unlock. Defective? Not sure..
5,"works great, easy to program","I had no idea if this thing would even work, but for the price, I thought I'd take a chance. When I got it, it looked and felt like the original, and was incredibly easy to program (less than 30 seconds). I would definitely recommend this."
5,Keyless Remote - Works like a charm,Works as described...much better than paying the high dollars the dealer wanted. Would purchase again. The instructions were spot on.
5,good stuff,"This is a great product and at a great price, too! I received it with a battery already in it and very clear instructions on how to program it to my truck. I followed the instructions and was done in less than a minute (seriously!). I would absolutely recommend this to anyone."
1,you get what you pay for,"Remote functions well, but the quality of the plastic halves is s#@$. Halves fit together akwardly. 4 more words required"
1,Didn't work - not happy,"I was very disappointed! I received the wrong remote and it didn't work for my vehicle. In order to get the right remote I would need to send it back and include $8 to get the right one. Very disappointed with product, and customer service."
5,As Promised,"Remotes were received very quickly. Progamming takes only a minute, literally. The best part is that they were a fraction of what a dealer would want for one."
4,Lisa Keith,"This isn't the version that I was looking for. I wanted the one they play on the radio but since it's a rare cd, I am willing to settle for this version. It would've been nice to be able to hear a sample of what I was purchasing."
2,This movie has...,"one good quality; it's original. The plot was very well thought out and it kept your interest. Where I feel the movie went wrong is in it's inabuility to move the plot along. I thought I was going to keel over and die before the violin would ever be sold at auction. It has a great and unusual story though, so I was able to stick it out."
3,What's the fuss about? This film just didn't do it for me.,"After reading the reviews, I suspected that I was in for a realtreat. But although the film had some beautiful music andphotography, I was left wondering why the story line was lacking in cohesion and completeness. The story bounces between ages and locations, but the thread that ties the stories together is very thin. None of the stories are particularly captivating, and the ending is completely unbelievable and disappointing."
3,Just wasn't impressed,"I can't tell you the number of people who demanded I see this movie. Maybe my hopes were set too high, but the movie left me expecting more. While each little story has its merits the overall package seemed disconnected emotionally. I also found the ending, where the secret of the violin is revealed, to be a little silly because it was obvious from the first 15 minutes what the secret was. I felt the director was setting me up for a big surprise that I already knew. Maybe this wasn't his intention. At any rate a lot of people like this movie but I'm unlikely to watch it again."
1,Very boring movie,"This movie was very boring, I was trying to stay awake through the whole movie, I finally switched it off towards the end, it was bad."
1,WTF?,"I tried jumping through the hoops to suggest a correction to the movie description, but apparently the description is not one of the things you're allowed to correct. The only route to viewers having their say is the reviews. This is a review of the description: complete blather. The computer algorithm that generates these things obviously failed big time. Hopefully a human at Amazon will read this.Also, I know if I try to leave this without rating the product it will bounce. I love the movie: 5 stars plus. The one star, the minimum I can give, is for the description.I tried to gather from the description what is special about this ""Special Edition"", to no avail."
4,The Red Violin,"This movie is fasinating. Even though I didn't understand the full premise on my first viewing, I couldn't stop watching. I finally understood enough to want to buy it and watch it several times. I have seen it once more and throughly enjoyed it."
4,A beautiful movie,"Samuel L. Jackson stars as man who finds this red violin which has many rumors around it. This movie tells the history of it and where it has been, what lives it touched and changed. The acting is amazing, and it's a pretty cool movie. Samuel L. Jackson is great as always, his best line is... ""What do you do when you get the thing you always wanted?"" This movie really makes you think. Just see it."
4,Over looked movie,"I don't remember when I first saw this movie, but I really enjoyed it. The acting and sets were great. And the way the movie flowed keeps you drawn in."
1,Not enough details to,figure out what is going on in the beginning. The nudity hits you like a ton of bricks and it is just plain stupid!
2,Not safe for CDs/DVDs,"We really wanted plastic instead of paper liners for long-term storage of our CDs and DVDs. It is sad that these are not safe to use due the residue issue.We did find another alternative, though, that seems much better:100 CPP Clear Plastic Sleeve with Resealable FlapThe price is quite reasonable and they worked just as well in terms of size and shape. The plastic is a bit thinner than the Memorex Keeper sleeves, but they still seem quite durable.If you are going to use the Memorex sleeves you pretty much have to use some sort of inner liner within the plastic liner -- like taking the CD paper liner/notes and using that as a barrier around the CD inside the plastic sleeve -- in order to prevent the residue problem.We did use inner liners with the new CPP sleeves, too, just for safety, but they do not seem to have the same problem as these Memorex covers."
4,Perfect for my needs but would like a more transparent,"I love these and use them for all my CD's and DVD's - one tiny complaint, while they are transparent- the colors on some are a bit too dark making it difficult to read the label on the disk inside."
1,A WASTE OF RESOURCES & ENERGY. NOT RECOMMENDED!,"I cannot NOT recommend this product highly enough.They are crap. As stated in previous reviews, these envelopes will indeed leach or transfer some sort of residue or offgas product onto your discs, rendering movies and music useless.I bought at least a COUPLE HUNDRED of these a few years ago, in an attempt to save storage space. HUGE mistake. Awhile back, we noticed music and movies with this 'stuff' on them. Much of our library (not massive by any means, but numbering quite a few boxed PBS, Charlie Chan, and other expensive series) has been ruined by these gawd-awful wastes of petroleum resources. Now in the process of reviewing our discs to see what can be salvaged, and what will have to be thrown away. Not fun.I wish someone with pockets deeper than mine would file a lawsuit against Memorex, to halt the sale of this defective product, and reimburse customers who have lost/damaged property due to negligence of this company."
1,Be Warned!! These Keepers Will Damage Your CDs & DVDs!!,"I have lost a significant number of CDs as the result of a sticky film that has transferred from the keeper to the contained CD. The amount of contamination varies with the color (with purple as the worst and orange the least damaging). CDs stored beside these in paper keepers were not damaged. In many cases, I have not yet been fully successful in removing the film.Based on a few observations, you probably won't see any contamination for at least a year -- but after two to three years, the result is devastating."
1,Ruined memories,"STAY AWAY from this GARBAGE!Many DVDs that I burned 4-5 years ago are now ruined. Exactly what other people on this forum have posted. Some chemical leaches onto the DVD or CD. NICE! THANK GOODNESS affordable external USB drivers are available now but that doesn't replace my photo memories. Thanks a lot, Memorex!"
4,Nice Collection of Songs,This is a very nice collection of songs to own and listen to - especially if you are a fan of PCD.
4,Good Read,"This book was a very good and quick read, I dont' think she is better than Zane, but I think she gives a lot of details as how to please someone. I enjoyed this book, but I think the ending was missing somthing."
5,Excellent Read,"This book was recommended by a friend, I was a bit skeptical at first. I could not put this book down. Looking forward to the follow up!"
1,Hope the sequels are better,I have read and enjoyed all of Mary Morrison's books and was anxious to read Somebody's Gotta Be on Top. It took me 3 weeks to read this book -- it was horrible. It was written for remedial readers -- it appears as though she rushed when writing this one in order to get to the next one. It was a complete mess -- typos -- scene jumping without finishing the thought/scene. I literally MADE myself finish the book only because I am hoping the sequels will get better. Take my advice - read the reviews get an idea what this one is about -- skip it and try the next one. Cross your fingers that the sequels are a reflection of her old writing style (which was good).
4,darin go what he deserved,Darin was thinking with what was between his legs and it got him in deep trouble but he wanted to be a player and he got what he deserved.
1,No more Mary B. for me,"I had not read any of the authors previous books, when I bought this one. After reading this particular book I refused to read any of her other books. This book was horrible, and the ending was even worse.A lot of times we don't know if a book is a sequel, so the Author should write so that you can pick up with any of the novels in the series. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless you like reading stories that go nowhere fast."
4,Insufficient but requisite!,"If you write or publish regularly, you'll need to devise addendums to the AP Guide. A short list might evolve into your own style guide, since the AP may not cover abbreviations you commonly use, for example. But this guide is indispensible prior to (or in lieu of) having your own guide (a monstrous task)."
2,"now after week feeding them, there are in a cage and still alive","I had an infestation in my apartment. I bought this bulk motomco Mouse bait.I put blocks in all the pathway, and they eat, and eat, and eat. for more than a week.After more than a week eating, I was thinking there were more than one mouse.I bougth a trap, and put a block inside the trap. First day I catch 2 mouses. And no more dirty in my apartment after that. That was all.But now they are living for 3 days in the cage, eat all the bait block (and all the others they eat before) but they are well feed, live an moving. Nothing happened to them with the bait. Look other kind of bait."
1,Rat Bait????,Although the rats and mice have not touched the bait they have built some nice nests in the bait stations. Total waste of money.
2,Not impressed,"I thought the quality of this boot was lacking. There was no lining on the leather above the ankle. Also I couldn't get my foot into it, even though I ordered and received my size. I sent them back."
3,Good riding boot,"First, buy half size lower than your normal size. These boots are really made for riding, and that's why I bought them. With the relatively higher heel and heaviness,, not a good walking boot (foot moves up and down). But they are well made, durable, and nice and sturdy for Harley riding...and they look good."
5,Stylish and comfortable,"I bought these for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. Wears them all the time. He says they are comfortable and likes them being shorter than regular boots, doesn't eat his socks!"
4,At $2 apiece this is a great deal,"After browsing my local Target for washcloths and finding either reasonably priced brillo pads or expensive cotton cloths, I have to say the Tommy Hifiger Washcloth 100% cotton cloth is a total steal at $2 and deserves 5 stars. If when you steam your face you like a cloth thick and absorbent enough not to poor the water down your neck, these cloths work well.I gave it 4 stars because, I do have more luxury wash clothes which are more plush and absorbent, but these are still good quality. These cloths are 10 times softer and more absorbent than Ikea's pack of 8 for 8 dollars, totally worth the extra dollar per cloth! Very hard to find better, for the price."
4,A great ride,"As usual Michael Crichton executes a brilliant set-up and brings in all the characters for introduction by the end of the second itieration. The bulk of the book is a rollercoaster ride and the suspense is heightened by periodically killing off his characters. Crichton doesn't end his books well, wrap up is not his forte. Interesting to see the changes they made to the movie, which would have definitely spruced up the characterisation in the book."
3,Might as well just watch the movie,"After reading this one for the second time, I have to conclude that the movie did a pretty good job. The whole premise of the book is completely far fetched (even the ""scientific"" explainations Crichton offers require the reader to suspend his/her disbelief) and really it is better suited as a movie.If you are looking for a literary escape and you haven't seen the film, I say go for it. These qualifications notwithstanding, pick up another of Crichton's for some escapist gold--Airframe or Timeline perhaps.Yes, I will even deign to assign this book a completely subjective letter grade: B-."
1,Crichton formula still doesn't work,"Maybe I expect too much.All of the Crichton books I've read have begun with a gripping scientific concept which serves as the anchor for the first half of the book. An anchor which Crichton cuts loose halfway through in order to make room for a couple of contrived chase scenes.Maybe Crichton has never been able to write books, but only mass-market screenplays. Unfortunately, the movie was even worse!"
5,"A great book, couldn't put it down, read it in 3 1/2 hrs.","This was the first Chrichton book that I read after seeing the movie and it was much better! Although some of the explanations were a little boreing I still learned alot. Great attention to detail and wonderfull descriptions. You won't be disapointed, nothing like the OK movie. Characters were believable and the plot was intricate. A extraordinary Sci-Fi novel!"
4,SO BOMB!!!!,"Is REALY GOOD. It only scores 8 becaus all the profanity (bad language). Also, people with delicat stomaches or young kids who tend to have nightmares, shouldn't read it becaus it's pretty gory. BUT IT IS THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!! And I've read a ton of books in my life. After reading Jurrasic park, I want to read ALL Michael Crichton's books!!! Well, BYE :)"
4,Jurassic Park,Jurassic Park is about people who get trapped on an island that is infested with dinosaurs. I highly recommend this book to ages 15 and up.
5,Great Read,Great book to get into. Although I saw the movie numerous times the book blows it out of the water. There are complete aspects of the book the movie left out
4,Good summer read,"Epub/Science Fiction: I have seen the movie a bunch of times so I was upset to see my favorite character offed. I've been reading a lot of Crichton lately, so there is a theme of science is getting ahead of ethics and law.First, while John Hammond is a nice guy who wants everyone it to enjoy his park in the movie, he is a self-centered nut who only wants the rich and elite to visit his park. The secrecy of his island is the basis for the demise of the island.I liked this book a lot. There are parts of the book that are in the movie, others that are in Lost World, while others are completely different. Most of the book has to do with the the chaos theory. I recommend it. There are some flaws and the ending was okay. Timeline was better."
4,Michael's Best,"Jurassic Park is a grippping suspense thriller where the unpredictable is natural. The book is much better than the movie, and shows alot more detail in the dinosaurs themselves. Alan Grant and his assistant Ellie Sattler are invited by a lunatic millionare to visit his ""Theme Park"" where he has bred living diosaurs. Of course, something bad happens and the dinosaurs run amok in the park, killing an extreme amount of people. Over all, Jurassic Park is a wonderful book which can be easily visalised as you read. Of course, there are elements that tha were left out from the movie (The giant ""birdcage""), and the movie spawned 2 horrible sequels."
4,A good sci-fi thriller,"The book is essentially about the reproduction of dinosaurs through genetic engineering with the aim of recreating and controlling them in an amusement park located on a remote island for the sole purpose of earning enormous profits. Of course, the masterminds behind this farfetched scheme failed to consider that the dinosaurs lived millions of years ago during another age in different climate conditions and that their behavior could not be controlled by man nor security measures installed at the park. Predictably, the predators are the main threat to the unlucky party of experts dispatched to the island. T-rexes, a dilophosaurus and dozens of fearsome velociraptors escape their confines through their savage, ferocious cunning as well as man's ignorance of the animals they attempt to reproduce. Michael Crichton's novel is heavy on technical details and medical theories that slow down the narrative in places, but the story remains a fine thriller."
5,Extremely enthralling and thought provoking,"I bought Jurassic Park because I loved Crichton's Timeline so much. Jurassic Park was very well written, and you can tell that a lot of research went into making this book.Mass amounts of description is used, which is why I don't reccomend this book for young adults.Although there is some gore and some phrases that make chills run along your back, the book is still decent which is one of the reason I liked it so much.I am glad Mr. Crichton kept it clean enough for people to read. I love all the science that is in the book, as well as being able to think that it could really happen in the near future.I also enjoyed the life that was put into the characters. Ian Malcom was one of my favorites. The ending was especially creative and well planned. I look forward to reading The Lost World."
3,They should have used some things in this in the movie.,"There were a lot of great things in this, most of which were not used in the movie. The plot gets a little dull in the sceans with Ian Malcom, doing the only thing he knows how to do, TALK!"
2,not that good,"an overrated book. as unbelievable as it may sound, I found it even less entertaining than the movie."
5,Speilberge fell one his head when writing movie.,This is a great science fiction book for readers of all ages. The movie was very disapointing. Too much gore and to little science. Dinosaurs not anough of a threat. I think Crichton should never of sold the rights to Speilberge.
4,A truly exciting book,"It was truly a very exciting book. It was exciting and interesting throughout the entire book. I just couldn't put it down. It never seemed to get boring at all. Even when it did it wasn't really boring, it just slowed down a bit to give more information on what was going on. It was always a needed part of the story so it wasn't really boring. It is a book that I would read again and enjoy many times."
5,The best book I have ever read,"This book is honestley my favorite book of them all. I have always loved it and I read it over and over again. It has everything you need in a good book. I think the movie is even better. After you read this book, you will be so in to dinosaurs and Jurassic Park that you can't even believe it. I have always loved this book and the movie. After reading the book I now have the dream of becoming a Paleontologist."
3,Not So Great...,"I'm giving this book three stars because I'm a science-fiction fan and because Jurassic Park does have a genuinely interesting concept. Crichton butchers the concept, though. The dialogue is stale, the setting is almost nonexistent, and the characters are flatter than Flat Stanley. The book isn't too terrible, I've seen worse writing, but overall it fell quite short of my expectations."
5,The best fiction book ever.,"Jurassic Park the movie does a grave injustice to the book. Riviting and scary ..., it doesn't go overboard with the dinosaurs and the techonolgy. Dr. Alan Grant and Elle Sattler are asked to take a tour of a magnificent new park. The evasive owner of the biotechnology company In-Gen and owner of the park John Hammond is there as well to supervice the epedition. The park is located on an island 80 miles west of Costa Rica. Isla Nublar is the perfect setting for suck a book. Grant and Sattler are joined by chaos therosist Ian Malcolm (my favorite character) and lawyer Donald Gennaro. This book will take you on a roller coaster ride that doesn't have too many thrills and spills. The end of the book is very beautiful, but very gritty at the same time."
2,Been There . . .,Done That . . . Bought the (logo'd) tee shirt (then wore it over stirupp pants!).Not at all what I expected after hearing Diane on a local radio show. Its the same information one picks up from reading a magazine article. Helpful to the VERY young (let's say 15-20 year olds).
1,No Need for it!,"I was very disappointed with this book, I purchased it after hearing rave reviews on a local radio talkshow. I felt that the book was basically explaining the obvious, you must drink lots of water to flush out the toxins etc.. it told me nothing that I didn't already know - and I'm definitely not a diet guru. I also didn't find the tips about making life changes very helpful, again it's nothing new - all you need to do is apply a little common sense. I say pass on this one, save some money!"
1,el Reloj no funcionaba,cuando recibi el reloj elpasdao sabado 2 de febrero 2013 no funcionaba lo lleve a una joyeria y la pila estaba toatlmente sufatada teniendo que reemplazarla y limpiar todo el area
4,CH Hose Reel,"Appears to be a quality unit and will solve the issue of those terrible coiled cords that come with most compressors, but be aware this unit does NOT come with the hose you will need to attach between the reel and the compressor. This should be mentioned somewhere!"
3,An abrupt and predictable ending...,"This novel was certainly not the type to keep you on the edge of your seat. It was filled with endless pages of character thought processes and when it came to the climax of the novel, everything was so abrupt, that it really didn't give the reader time to fully process what was going on.I like the characters and I could empathize with what they were going through. I just wish it had been written a little more realistically.For an evening of fluff reading, this novel is just the ticket!"
1,turn a blind eye,How much about The Future you can learn by someone who thinks Global Warming is a superstition?Is really saddening that such poor judgments are still made in the XXI century.
1,Don't waste your time and money !!!,"This book is neither good contents nor sharp predicts. What is this book?I think it is just garbage. If you want get more information for your future life and your future business, it is better that you need to read Toefler's work, The Revolutionary Wealth. Naisbitt is not present man any more. He is the past man!!!"
5,"Great Book, Addicting!","This is a Great Book! My friend and I had always been interested in Magick. Well one day we were in a store and we picked up this book...well with in two minutes we were addicted. We both wanted to get, but were too chicken. The next day she went back and got it and I still haven't gotten it. I love to borrow it and it has wonderful material. If you find it, it's a must have!"
3,Not My Favorite,"This is a classic, and I read it after Julia Sweeney recommended it on her blog. I didn't find it to my liking, but that's just me."
3,Frustrating,"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie made such a tremendous impression on me that I thought I might have found a new favourite author. No such luck. It's as though Muriel ran out of Spark after writing her magnum opus. Okay, okay, the pun's not the thing!The climax and denouement are brilliant but one has to get there; and getting there is rough going. Ms. Spark could have done better. She clearly had the talent. I feel short changed."
2,Not that great,Mainstay's Well meaning fiction did not capture my attention. It is too bad because they are full of talent but are somewhat lack luster. Basically this CD could put you to sleep. Sorry
4,Re-examining the Legend,"This is an interesting book of essays on John Ford's Westerns. A number of topics are covered, such as Ford's use of music, the relationship between Ford and Frederick Remington's image of the West, the way Ford depicts different ethnic groups in his films.By and large, the authors are sympathetic to John Ford (a good thing in my mind) and they clearly appreciate the movies. I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 since there is some repetition among the different authors. (For example, everyone is compelled to discuss the last scene of ""Fort Apache."") Still, it is a pleasure to read a jargon-free academic book on Ford's Westerns."
1,"Used, good for nothing purchase of a Daewoo","A waste of money, no remote and did not work manually. The guy I bought it from should not be allowed to do business here."
3,just ok,Was a cute book of short stories but seemed more geared for the young adult then the mature reader.
4,Citizen Girl - the Saga Continues,"Amusing is just a small word for this sardonic look at the world of non-profit organizations. The team of McLaughlin and Kraus (The Nanny Diaries) have once again touched the delicate nerve of a heretofore thought of untouchable world. They present the adventures of a sincere, philanthropic (Girl) into the realities of the world of ""make it or break it"" non profit organizations. They have targeted woman's inequalities, but this could be any non-profit subject. Girl is sincere in her attempts to re-mold her ideas into the reality of the non-profit monies. While the description of a celebratory debacle of woman's needs gone berserk was slightly over the top for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the frustration of Girl as she manuvered her way through inexplecable do's and do not's, while maintaining a somewhat normal sexual relationship with a dot.com guy. The book will leave the reader pleased that they have entered the non-profit world and left unscathed."
1,Horrible Customer Service,I cannot write a review on how the item was because I never got it! I would tell others to NOT purchase from this candy company. I had to contact Amazon to get a refund. The candy company expected me to research where and when the item was shipped. They were rude. BUYER BEWARE!!!!
1,"Written for children, but not a good idea.","Children can be influenced by what they read. Inviting kids to join a cult can be as bad as inviting them to a mike jackson and r kelly wine party. Peaple should not be allowed to go to church or any religious event until they are at least 18 to allow them to make clear decisions. ""... up from one of those stupid pro-wrestling shows ... I'm not sure ..."" OK?"
5,excellent,"I would reccommend this cd to all Bertie Higgins fans. I first saw his show in Ft. Walton Beach, Florida. I became a fan and highky reccommend this cd to all people who love island music."
5,We Love The Wiggles!!!,"These songs are so ADDICTING!!! You will find yourself walking around singing them to yourself!............Oh yeah,my toddler loves it too!LOL!"
1,Satire of children's themed music gone too far?,"I was staying in a hotel in Atlanta waiting to be picked up when I came across the TV show of The Wiggles. I was appalled that they could play it on TV during the day time when a child might be watching!!!Children should not be allowed to witness such insanity. Do you want your child to think that it is OK for grown men to behave like THAT???Children should be exposed to things that will improve their minds, not sicken them.;)"
2,Animation not impressive.,"Compared to the incredible computer animation that's been around since ""Shrek"" this really pales in comparison. The backgrounds and characters have an ""unfinished"" look about them. The story line is indeed week as stated in another review. ""Harold Kelp"" has a habit of screaming every 3 or 4 minutes which becomes annoying in a very short time. The only reason for taking a look at this movie is for the fact that Jerry Lewis did contribute his voice to the project.Kids should enjoy it."
5,Great gift,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter who specifically requested this movie. She was very pleased with her gift.
5,Saw the tour with the full group and it was outstanding,"The group toured with a bunch of major players to some very selective dates and they were backed up by the Duke Ellington School choir where the concert was. It was one of those very rare moments in a jazz listener/collectors life. It was one of the best concerts I have ever seen and I have seen a fair share of jazz over the last 20 years. The album is one of my all time favorites, and with close to 3000 records, that says a lot. Such beauty and variety in composition. Feel free to email me."
3,Not nearly as good as the colors one,"My son LOVES the ""twinkle"" DVD (Little Laureate's My World Colors) we got him with the colors... this one, on the other hand, he could care less about. Not enough interesting things for him to watch, and the music is not nearly as good. If you're looking for a DVD that can teach your kid something and will be entertaining enough to watch for the whole hour - go with the colors one."
2,Really cheap,"I am so disappointed. The outfit looks so cute on the model. The hat is not like a regular pillbox hat. It doesn't have any cardboard to keep its shape. It's pretty much like a sailor hat. The dress was just a mess. It was see-through, short, and absolutely huge! I know it's a one-size-fits-all, but holy smokes it was like a tent on me! I have a 24 in waist for reference. The only good thing about this was the sunglasses. I'm sending this back for sure."
2,Does not match any size!,"Luckily I sew decently and i was able to make alterations to this dress. I'm a size 2, 5'3"", and this dress fits me fits me fir the height but definitely not the rest. It's at least size 6, i needed to shrinken it of 4 inches!It is ok, good price, but keep in mind that is not for petite women."
3,Not so easy,Not so easy duets for high school trumpet player. Would advise talking to instructor before purchasing this music. The music pieces are very fast.
3,Good collection of articles on this subject,"This book is a collection of contributions from various authors on the properties, synthesis, uses, and modeling of amorphous carbon. Most of the contributions have been previously published in journals or other medium, and so have been peer-reviewed. The various sections in the book provide a wealth of data on amorphous carbon and is a good reference for obtaining numbers for various mechanical, electrical, solid-state, surface, and optical properties of amorphous carbon. Unlike other books on the topic, this one also includes a chapter on modeling of amorphous carbon, including Molcular Dynamics, and Density Functional Theory studies. All in all, this is a good intro book on this subject."
2,"Not great, but not lost money either","Well.. the movies are not awesome, some cheesy end of the world movies (Hallmark type) but you can enjoy watching them..."
1,"No Billie, or Coltrane???","After viewing this movie last night, I hurried on-line to look for the CD soundtrack with hopes I could get that lush cut from Coltrane ""Easy to Remember,"" and some of Billie Holiday's snippet vocals from the movie. Sadly, those wonderful jazz tunes are NOT found here..."
4,"Great CD, fabulous singer","Marisa Monte is indeed a rare occurrence in nowadays musical scene for her music doesn't know geographical nor time boundaries. Her music brings the signature Brazilian swing permeated by Jazz influences making it easily enjoyable for a broad audience. Marisa Monte not only promotes contemporary Brazilian songwriters but also nostalgically honors the best of Brazilian popular music tradition. Differently from the so called North American ""Divas"" that usually scream Marisa's soft but incredibly precise voice makes singing look easy."
5,A Great Cocktail of Senses and Styles !!!,"I just heard somebody talking about her. I went to the shop. I asked to listen to the whole CD, I just listened to the first title... ""I'll get it !"". Her voice is tremendously powerful, her phrasing is more than perfect and she can do absolutely everything: from Ella to Elis, from bossa to rock. Simply Get it !, I have framed this album in my living room."
2,"interest performance, very poor quality","These performances from around 1990 are interesting from an artistic point of view, particularly the Rite of Spring. However these are taken from television broadcasts and the video and audio quality are very poor. Probably they duplicate the experience of watching the performance on a Soviet-made television. Sound is also quite poor."
4,Fahrenheit Underbellly,"This CD is pretty tight, it has cool beats and First Degree flows good. I wish it had more lynch and sicx on it but it still slumps nicely with the 6 x 9's."
5,Are you tattling or reporting?,This book is a must read at the start of the school year or when the tattles start exploding all around you! Students learn to determine whether they are tattling or reporting. I typed up a variety of tattles and items that were necessary to report. I had the students work in pairs to determine if what they chose was a tattle or something that needed to be reported. I am 4 weeks into my school year and tattling is NOT a problem thanks to this book! Great book!
2,Don't really understand,This unit is similar to my old one but for some reason this unit will not work anywhere near as good as my old unit did. I tried to see if there was something obvious but there just isn't. I can go over the same spot multiple times and not get the algae but one rub with your foot and the algae comes right off. It's like the bristles aren't even touching the surface. I don't get it.
1,Most Disappointing Box Brownies Ever = skip the impulse 2 Buy,"While everything is relative and this might be a terrific brownie IF you worship at the Temple of Low Carb diets, this version of Brownies was a monumental disappointment. The process requires 3 eggs and lots of butter (read Unhealthy), then requires cooking in a water bath (dish within a dish of water), requires glass square dishes, and comes out as a thin brownie with a crust. The process was laborious and the result was very unsatisfying, being thin like the height of bread, poorly textured, and poor mouth feel product. I can't say too little about this product, except that this product makes one savor and fully appreciate the genius and deliciousness of Ghiradeli and Betty Crocker box brownies."
1,costs way too much!,I have never paid so much for a box of junk in my life. I would have returned it but didn't want to pay more. I would not buy this again. Why does it cost more to leave out the sugar? back to the drawing board manufacturers. I hate your bownie mix.
4,Works good,I have a boston terrier who passes gas all the time and this little odor removing air filter does the trick. It works pretty good.
3,Worthy of your collection..,"Just as the other review states, not the best audio or video for that matter. But not BAD either, just like a lower budget concert footage film. Not to take anything away from the performancethough, it was excellent. i would have given the review 5 stars for its content if the audio was better....."
5,My favorite disposable respirator,"My wife and I use these whenever we can get them. The stiff foam-like filters are not as comfortable and do not conform to our faces as well as the CoolMAX. She has dust allergies and these work for her when we clean attics, basements or do remodeling projects."
5,Great closeups,"The best thing about this edition is the extreme closeups of many of the paintings. It is interesting to see how Van Gogh applied his paint. Occasionally the paintings are printed side-by-side with the original sketches that inspired the paintings, another great insight into Van Gogh's technique. The first 50 pages (of 150 pages) are about Van Gogh's early work which is darker with a browner palette, a phase I don't enjoy as much. But this is typical of books on Van Gogh. Some of the reproductions don't seem very crisp which seems odd for a book printed in 1999 by the Van Gogh Museum (which should have had the leisure to get good photographs).This isn't the best book on Van Gogh but it has features not seen in other books. Plus it is available for a good price especially in paperback. Because of the closeups and the larger-than-usual reproductions of a few paintings I love (like ""Undergrowth"") this book rounds out my Van Gogh book collection rather nicely."
1,Sailor Moon,If this is the best Anime has to offer.Stick to Looney Tunes because this crap is no redeeming qualities whatso ever.The DVD quality is pretty bad too.
2,WAIT! IT GETS BETTER,This Particular Trigun DVD is terrible. The second one isn't a lot better. However the rest of them are outstanding. Volumes 3 - 8 are really good. It starts off slow and goofy. You are lead to believe the main character (Vash The Stampede) Is a buffoon. But he isn't. Do not be fooled by the first two volumes. This is a great series.
3,Kiddie cartoon,"Well after reading how great this anime was I was expecting it to have great art design and cool shoot out scenes. Unfortunately it's not that at all. It's a silly cartoon meant for kids. I enjoyed it as a saturday morning cartoon but not like Ninja scroll or Vampire hunter D anime. It's a very mild anime and not an action packed keep you at the edge of your seat flick. It's funny, it has a kinda like Pokemon humor to it. So if your into blood, guts and cool fight scenes this is not for you. On a side note I think it's over priced for a Saturday morning toon. My advise rent or buy it used you'll thank me later."
5,"AUNQUE NO LO CREAS, EL TEMPERAMENTO","DEL ADOLESCENTE NO BROTA DE LA NADA NI SE CONSTRUYE EN UN DIA...Este es el libro PERFECTO para tu Pre Adolescente...Si sigues sus pautas ( que son super inteligentes )estarás abonando una adolescencia feliz y serena...NO UNA AREA DE GUERRA MUNDIAL !MAS VALE PREVENIR QUE LAMENTAR CUANDO YA NO ES TIEMPO...En serio, amiga: Prepara a tus pre adolescentes !A mi, me lo recomendó el sicologo y estoy encantada porque comienzo a ver los resultados en el mayorcito que tiene 15 años !"
5,The Mail has come in,"What can I say, Fan Mail is all that I expected and more. TLC has done it again!! With TLC's ever-changing style it's hard not to love this album. I can't even begin to put into words how great this group is and great this album is. TLC is my favorite group of all time and not just because my name is in the cover :) They said they did it for the fans and we apreciate every song, thank you!!"
2,No Scrubs is exactly the bases I wanna keep with you k?,"The album only has one good but still played out song "" NO Scrubs"", its sooooo played out that even TLC gets annoyed of it now. I didn't really hear the rest since they were are edited. I was trying not to explode while listen to their music because of the pitch of it."
4,Very Good,"I listened to the whole CD, and I'd say that its very good. TLC covers a wide range of topics, from love to sex to self respect. An answer to the naysayers who say that Fanmail couldn't possibly measure up to CrazySexyCool, that's not true. Fanmail has meaningful lyrics like Waterfalls on CrazySexyCool, just listen to tracks Unpretty and Dear Lie. Tionne's writing makes for some of the best lyrical content on the album, and her voice is still good. Lisa raps more on this album than on the last one, which gives it more energy. And Chilli's voice is wonderful on Come On Down and I Miss You So Much.I admit that Silly Ho is not the best track, and any appeal No Scrubs might have was killed by the radio. The best tracks are 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 17. Overall it is a very good album and it's more personal than CrazySexyCool."
3,Ok......,"I asked for this cd for my birthday last year and recieved it. I was asking for this cd because it had the two famous singles on it which were ""Unpretty"" and ""No Scrubs"" which I really enjoyed hearing on the radio. But when I put on this cd I was horified to discover that I had the one with the explicit lyrics! I hate cussing and it should never be used in something as wonderful as music. I did not like the song ""I'm Good At Being Bad"" That is the worst song on the cd with lots of awful cussing and just plain bad stuff in it. Do not buy this cd if you are like me and hate cussing!"
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!,"......and you will too if you don't listen to what I say and buy this piece of .......I can't even dignify it by calling it trash. I am so upset that I spent money on this cd. I've enjoyed TLC through the years, but somewhere between their last cd and this one someone stole their talent. I KNOW that they can do better than this........ heck.... I can do better than that!"
1,Get A Grip!,"After perusing a large lot of these so-called ""reviews"", one thing is very evident: the bulk of you could use a remedial english class. Your spelling and writing style are atrocious. Rather than wasting your time writing these sadful, pining ""critiques"", most of you would be well advised to futhering your education..."
5,This groupand cd rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My sis has this cd I listen to it it is soooo cool especially the song ""No Scrub"""
5,a crazysexycool mix of beats so far,"i just heard ""no scrubs"" and loved how the beginning is so mellow and then you hear the lyrics and you have to laugh. the mixing and sampling is different so you have to sit back and listen then get into the groove."
5,"The BOMB, The S#@%","I just can't believe what they have come to. The new album just shows how talented they are. The beats are awesome and the liricks are out of this world. These beautiful women, I think, will be around for a while."
3,I LOVE TLC SONGS,CHILLIE U R FINE AND THE OTHER TWO R TO.COULD U WRITE ME BACK PLEASE.HAVE ALL YOUR CDS.
3,Fanmail is something different.,"TLC have never actually been forgotten in the music world and Fanmail was a way of telling the world ""thank you for remembering us"" and ""this is what we are about now"". They seemed to have a continuous teen-like, youthful element in their songs- No Scrubs is a good example. I loved the mix of what seemed to be a love song and an all out acceptance of their present ""characters"" with the harder rock background in Good at being bad. I feel that this was a good album- perhaps not great, but good. The slow ballads were nice if not fantastic and Fanmail is fun to listen to at all times."
2,"I Liked it better when they were ""CrazySexyCool"".","I was disapointed when I heard Fanmail. There were TOO MUCH of that harsh techno beats in some songs and not enough smooth groves. Clearly the trio could never top their last album, but I just hope that the next TLC CD is better than this one."
2,Okay,I just think that No Scrubs and Unpretty are good on this CD. I'm not saying this is a bad CD but those are the only two I like.
1,Okay......,"""Fanmail""..I still listen to to somewhat......But the cd is ""stale""....I like how group member Rozanda Thaomas is more ""stunning"" amd gets some more of the spotlight, but poor tracks like ""Dear Lie"", ""No Scrubs"" and ""My Life"" who would have stop they where a gropu thats been arounf FOREVER....also where is Ms Lopes...shes nowheere throughout............."
1,Over-played throwaway $#&*^#@*@#!!(junk),"This album has no worth. TLC's second album was pretty appealing to me, yet the first was just a bunch of clutter and junk moving around over vocals. So this was TLC's chance to prove what they're really made of. Okay, I'll admit ""No Scrubs"" was a good track, but after seeing the video a bazillion times and remembering all the video posterings it was played so much, it lost flavor. I can't stand hearing this commercialized synthesizer-dominated I liked ""No Scrubs"" before the video came out. Back then no one even knew what the hell a scrub was. Compared to their last album, this is terrible(it is compared to anything, really), but I can't believe after CrazySexyCool that they would put out this junk. Sorry TLC(and fans), but the only reason this is popular is because of the ""scrub hype""."
5,"TLC are back , and aint nobody gonna stop 'em!!!","I have been a sincere fan to TLC since I can remember,and if you want my advise BUY IT! These three beautiful girls are showing their true talents in this amazing album ""FanMail"" AMEN"
5,TLC Rule!,"This album is my favourite album ever! The last 3 tracks and a couple of other songs aren't very good, but the rest is great."
4,A Late Descovery,"I have never really been a fan of TLC, but when their songs would come on the radio I would sing along. I have had DEar Lie stuck in my head for ages and couldnt get rid of it so I decided to buy the album and i only wish that i had bought it earlier. The album contains the hits Dear Lie, No Scrubs and Unpretty. The album also contains great tracks like Silly Ho and Come On Down. I know finally know what all of the fuss was about"
2,waste of money,"I like TLC, but the albums was not all that I Just like two songs on there. They could done better then this. Tell you the true I don't no why I brought this cd, I should have of save my money.I like crazysexycool that was the best cd. but i am still a TLC fan"
4,"It was very good, but...","I really enjoyed this movie, but the language is rough, especially towards the end. I would still recommend it though, Maya Rudolph is wonderful as is the guy from the Office (how do you spell his last name? lol). I am a fan of independent movies, if you are as well, you will enjoy this drama about this young couple trying to find their home."
3,watched b/c...,"...of george harrison cover.Meh, trailer was the highlight...slow moving and not very funny. My expectations were not met at all"
3,This ain't no heir to the throne! (an extra star for the Cool Ruler!),"I was expecting greatness--a passing of the Cool Ruler's torch to his son--instead, we get an album where this reggae master, song by song, continously schools his offspring. Gregory sings lead on all the odd numbered songs and Kevin takes over on the even songs. Unfortunately, Kevin's vocals are forgetable and I much prefered this to be another great Cool Ruler Disc. Apparently, if his son's songs were omitted, the album might be pretty good. Another unfortunate detail, father and son sing different vocals over the same instrumental track. This becomes monotonous--I recommend burning Gregory's songs to a disc and torching his son's songs completely."
4,It's OK,"This CD was OK, but not as good as the older BA CD's. This CD sounds like an older, more settled down Bryan Adams. He brings back some old sounds, such as the guitar in ""Before the Night is Over"", which sounds similar to ""One Night Love Affair"". I like this CD, but I'm waiting for another CD that's as good as Reckless."
3,Klimek - Milk & Honey,"Klimek's MILK AND HONEY is ambient in the Tim Hecker vein: tiny loops of sound, layered and arranged to form a thick sonic palette. Even as a few strums of guitar resolve themselves on ""(Sun)rise,"" the sound remains diffuse, refracted. On ""Sand"" and ""Wind,"" he introduces blasts of sound, then let them drift off, leaving behind contrails. The guitar on ""Home"" and ""Blood & Tears"" hover like an unfinished country song, and the one-two of ""Milk"" and ""Honey"" insinuate themselves onto your consciousness. Indeed, the album is most of a piece, and while it's delicately crafted, it can fade into your consciousness rather easily. But Klimek ends the album with ""Back Against the Sea,"" an almost symphonic variant of his technique, which adds a sense of grandeur. The album stays true to its title: it's both sweet and rich."
3,mask....good but nose area hurts my nose,"The mask is easy to use and really filters out chemicals. However if worn for more than 20 or more, the nose peice begins to hurt my nose. My old mask, forgot what brand, does not have the problem. Maybe I can do something to fix it. The rubber around the nose just seems a little hard."
1,CST - Math 9-12,"When I puchased this book I was under the impression it was a review book for the New York State CST-Math test and expected hints and stratgies for taking the exam. Instead, I recieved a handtyped notebook with diagrams hand drawn and only 80 multiple choice problems and an answer key (just the answers, no explanations). I found this very disappointing concidering how much I paid for the book. When I sat down to work through the few problems it gave me, I found mistake after mistake. A total of 8 mistakes, that is 10% of the book! To top everything off the test itself had 100 questions and they were nothing like those found in the book."
1,Here's an alternate idea!,"After reading the previous review for this book, I researched alternative routes for review guides for the NYS Mathematics CST. I found that the NYS Teacher Certification Exams website had a FREE review guide with a sample test and explanations for the answers. The website is www.nystce.nesinc.com/. I suggest that you check this out before paying $50 for this book. I would also like to say a special thank you to the person who wrote the previous review because you saved me $50!"
5,Great Set of Inexpensive Beginner Clubs,"This is a great inexpensive starter set for a beginner like myself. I've been hitting with them quite a bit over the past few months and I've never had a problem with them. The bag is great, the driver, 3wood and 5wood are nice, and irons are perfectly fine for a beginner like myself. I do wish the set had a lob wedge and a sand wedge in addition to the pitching wedge that was included. Also, the putter could be better. Overall though, if you're a beginner and you don't want to spend a lot of money, this is an excellent set for you."
3,Nothing too exciting,I got these as gifts and was somewhat disappointed. The tools are small as others have stated and I am not sure of the overall functionality of it. It is cute as a gag gift but for real world application I think there are better options. I think one of the biggest drawbacks was that the fork is on the outside of the knife when closed. I didn't think it would be a big deal but it just makes it feel unfinished.
5,"How a young, powerful federal agency was charged with protection","Highly recommended is Robert W. Collin's THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY: CLEANING UP AMERICA'S ACT. While this could've been featured in our Political Shelf area (it's part of Greenwood's 'Understanding Our Government' series), it's better featured here, for it's vital importance to the issues involved in cleaning up environmental problems. The EPA is a young, powerful federal agency which is faced with the task of environmental protection in a world daily affected by changing technology and its after-products. Chapters chart political and social controversies but also survey its organization, programs, key events, and social impact. Details on environmental clean-up challenges are particularly insightful, offering clues on how the agency responds and operates."
3,DE NUEVO MANA PERO SU DISCO NADA NUEVO,"HE SEGUIDO LA TRAYECTORIA DE ESTE GRUPO DE ROCK MEXICANO DESDE SUS INICIOS, PERO AHORA QUE REGRESARON, TENIA LA ESPERANZA DE ENCONTRAR ALGO MAS NOVEDOSO, MAS RITMICO, QUE SUPERARA A LOS ANTERIORES DISCOS, PERO DESAFORTUNADAMENTE ES EL MISMO ESTILO QUE LOS ANTERIORES, EL MISMO PENSAMIENTO DE SUS CANCIONES CON SUS MISMOS RITMOS E INTERPRETACION,HASTA PODRIA DECIRSE QUE SON ALGUNAS COPIAS DE SUS ANTERIORES CANCIONES. EN POCAS PALABRAS SU MISMO ROCK REPETITIVO, CREO QUE NO VALIO LA ESPERA DE TANTO TIEMPO SI SE ESPERABA UN MEJOR DISCO. CREO QUE MEJOR QUE ""DONDE JUGARAN LOS NINOS"" JAMAS PODRAN SUPERARLO. OJALA QUE TENGAN MAS CREATIVIDAD PARA COMPONER EN SUS FUTURAS CANCIONES, PORQUE DE ALAS, CORAZON,DOLOR, PIEL, BARES ETC YA ESTAMOS INUNDADOS EN SUS CANCIONES"
4,After a few days I understand,"Now I understand what other users are saying, is not that their sound is the same, if that was the case, the CD would be great. Their unique sound is what I've grown to love about this band.The CD isn't bad, the lyrics are new and the more I listen to it the more I like it. The problem is the melody, it sounds like a recycled product from previous songs and it makes this album ordinary at best, it doesn't sound any different or any more innovative than releasing an unplugged version of previously released songs! (even though I like the MTV unpluged version) Is to bad, I was really looking forward to it.All in all, the album isn't bad. So if you are a fan of this band I would recomend getting this albun (since you are a fan) and if you have limited knowledge about this band I would recomend picking up this album since every melody will sound new to you!"
2,very weak DVD,"First, I payed $17,99 for the DVD - and don't pay more! As the first review says, the artwork improved, but so much got worse. Some voices have changed and the story (3 episodes, 2 stories) are very weak. New Aragami and new Girl appear somehow in Japan, then USA, then government talks about the bad relationship between USA and Japan. Japan helps USA fighting the Aragami. Momiji caught by Aragami. Very quick and easy termination of master Aragami - story over! Third episode even more stupid. All the girls went bathing. Out of a sudden there is a bomb in the pool - from a terrorist who wants money. No Aragami anywhere. Episode ends as stupid as it has begun.Extras on DVD: Some trailers and a new episode of the omake theater - but no fun at all.I got the Blue Seed Collection and enjoyed it. But this new DVD was only made for money making ;-("
4,Not as I remembered,"Maybe my sense of smell has changed, but I remembered loving this perfume, now it's ok a bit strong for my taste but I am sure I can find someone that will use it. overall a good perfume."
5,Love My Bubba,"Use this item daily especially when working out, I love it! Stays cold all day long. The lid can leak if not on tight, but after taking a drink just tigten it up and it's good to go! My friends all joke with me for carring such a massive jug but I have water all day long! After 2 years my bubba is still going strong though showing it's age it still works great."
2,Horrible description,"The item I wanted was suppose to be blue , just like the title says. I receive a pink and grey one"
4,Much better than Hercules / Xena,"If like me you hated how ignorant Hercules and Xena were, and want more serious fantasy like Lord of the rings. Beastmaster meets somewhere in the middle.It of course does not have the big budget that rings did, but it still comes off very emotional and better written than Herc/Xena.If you are an animal lover you may even tear up a few times while watching.I'm glad that I finaly jumped in and bought the series."
4,send to ipad,All i wish was it is available as a e magazine save a lot of cost available to read faster
4,Uncanny,"Ms. Yamagata has brilliantly created an album that seems to have been overlooked by so many of the people who would be her fans. i just bought the album and have had time to only quickly listen to it, and it blows you away. It's absolutely brute beautiful art. It got only four stars because it is also unbelievable that this isn't Fiona Apple's newest release. Her vocals and her music almost mimic Ms. Apple's mastery, and she is a good person to mimic, but she lacks no originality, either. Great buy."
4,Happy About Happenstance,"I first heard the song: ""Reason Why"" on an episode of The O.C. I had no idea who she was nor did I know what the song was. Luckily The O.C tells the names of the artists they feature in their episodes otherwise I would still have no idea. I loved this song right away and knew I NEEDED to have it. I was really drawn to her voice. It's kind of a cross between Fiona Apple with a Tori Amos type approach in her music. So, I saw it one day in the store and had to buy it. Such a great purchase it was. Very talented singer/songwriter!Standout tracks include: ""Reason Why"" (my favorite), ""Be Be Your Love"", ""Paper Doll"" and ""Worn Me Down"".All the songs have a great melodic feel to them with her genuine and at times very deep lyrics.So happy I caught that episode of The O.C!"
2,What happened?,"We saw her live at Madison Square Garden, opening up for David Gray. She was an intensly powerful and emotional singer; just her and her piano, she had no need for anything else. She reminded me of a cross between Tori Amos and Fiona Apple and I was looking forward to hearing more of her.When I got this disc, I wasted no time in putting it into the player, and when it was over I wasted no time in taking it out. The songs are great, but the production was terrible; overblown, over tracked, and too cluttered. Next time, leave her and her songs alone."
3,Not nearly as good as I thought it would be...,"It was too long and a little too slow for my liking. He was too brooding, too silent, and was it okay then to punch everyone when you felt like it? I like other Capra films, but this was just okay for me. I like to divide movies into ""would I watch it again if someone else wanted me to watch it with them or not?"" The answer would be 'no'. I'd find something else better and more interesting to do with my two hours."
2,Dead End Deviated,"I'm giving only two stars to this CD because this release by Dead End is a letdown after owning Shambara, the release that came before it. With Zero, it appears the band tried going in a new direction-- less ""spooky metal"" and more a minimalistic, drums/bass/voice sound. Furthermore, the songwriting quality is lost (few hooks and nothing radio worthy), and this effort sadly lacks the heavy guitar sound of their previous two CDs. In fact, it makes me wonder if perhaps this lackluster effort cost them their record deal and helped lead to their break-up. Just a theory. Anyway, don't fall prey! Save your money for another day."
3,Strips That Sizzle,I needed this book for a class I was taking. I haven't used it since. I think it would be a great book for those who love working with strip piecing. I found it to be well written and the instructions were easy to follow.
3,It's ok,"I have admired quilts made from this book for many years. When I finally decided to order the book, I was somewhat disappointed, but I really don't know why. It's a nice book and the quilts made using this technique are pretty. Kind of a weird review isn't it."
1,DONT BUY THIS THING,"I got this after my creative zen sleek, i should have stuck with creative. this thing is a piece of junk if you just want an mp3 player.Firstly you cannot play songs from an album by track number,which surely you should be able to do,without having to put numbers in front of the names which is a pain if you have a big library of music. Even after i upgraded the firmware to version 3.0. secondly when watchin videos the backlight doest stay on without you haveing to set it so when you go back to listening to music you have to change the backlight setting.As a video player its nothing special as the screen is too small.the menu system is terrrible, there is no quick way of getting the songs you want.there's no shuffle mode.it trys to do lots of things but does each one badly.even the tetris sucks on it. stick with creative or iriver id you want a good mp3 player."
2,it is not recognized by my PC,"please help, i bought this stuff coz its cool features, but the moment i arrive home (bought it overseas) the device was not recognized by my PC..what should i do? pls help..thanks"
3,"Enormous. WAY to big to be a true ""martini"" glass.","I have no one but myself to blame--I just convinced myself that they'd be okay, for some reason; I knew the capacity was 12 ounces--but you might as well learn from my mistake: IF you want to serve classic martinis (a couple of ounces of gin, a little vermouth--even up to 1 ounce, if you're going for the Original Recipe) then these things are simply too, too big. Just imagine how 3 ounces of liquid will look (and would you really want to make a Double, only to have it get warm while you sip? I'd rather just make another icy cold round, myself ;-) in a 12 ounce bowl, and you'll see that these are just not right for the job.I kept them, anyway--they're sturdy and well made for the price--but they're useful only for frozen margaritas, maybe a shrimp cocktail, or something similar...In that respect, I believe they are mis-labeled and thus that's why I gave them only 3 stars."
1,Worst packing,"Bought 12 glasses, 6 glasses to a package. The two packages were shipped in a box filled with packing material, but no one thought to protect each glass. Upon arrival, all but 3 of the glasses were smashed, having bumped up against each other during the entire trip to my home."
4,Croatian terrorists in NYC,"Robert K. Tannenbaum (who I believe is or was Mayor of Beverly Hills) has produced a couple of these lawyer novels, with the main character, in contrast to Grisham et al, a prosecutor. Butch Karp (don't you love that name?) is a young ambitious Assistant DA in the NYC prosecutor's office, with the twist that things all take place when Tannenbaum was apparently there as a young man, in the mid-70's. This time he's trying to put Croatian Terrorists behind bars for killing a bomb squad cop. There are some amazing twists of the plot, and a few that stretch credulity or are rather sudden, but the whole thing is entertaining reading, if a bit long. It also has a rather anti-climactic ending that some might find offensive (a disabled person impersonates one of the main characters and disgraces him). If you can overlook these rather minor flaws, it's a good book."
4,Kind of Muddled...,"This is my third Butch Karp novel - and I really like the series. However, I think this one was my least favorite. There are way too many characters (CIA, FBI, NYPD, The Catholic Church, the Mossad, Croats, Serbs, Nazis... get my point?) Also there were many plot points that are left undone. What happened to Leventhal? Why did Karavitch set the bomb or hijack the plane?It just felt kind of unfocused. I won't give up on Tanenbaum yet, though. I'll definitely read a few more, and hope that he can redeem himself."
2,Dubious sturdiness,"I agree with everything the previous reviewer said, about the look, that is. Last week the set arrived at my door. I immediately opened the box, tore off the plastic wraps, and was more than pleased with the good look and the feel of the clubs and the bag. The very next day, however, my excitement turned into disappointment. After a couple of swings at the driving range, the head of the driver broke! Taking a closer look at the broken head, all I could tell is it appeared to be made of some cheap stuff, plastic and aluminum, maybe? From the beginning I knew I was getting a cheap set that might not last long, yet it still surprised me by lasting THAT short."
1,Did not work on white bugs!,Smells peppery but did not do anything to the white little bugs on my plants.
5,Welcome Aboard in my dreams,There are some really beautiful pictures above and below deck. The facts that are mentioned through out the book keep you interested the whole time the book is open. I find myself going back to the book over and over again. I definatly recomend this book to anyone how loves boats & wood work.
2,Juvenile,"Apparently, the Roman Legions were populated by middle class British public school graduates. Scarrow makes no attempt whatsoever to represent the mindset and customs of actual Legionaires; the vernacular utilized is that of 20th century Great Britain. I will not be purchasing any more of this series, and probably will not finish reading the first one. It might make a screenplay for an average animated movie aimed at juveniles if the sex and violence were tamed a bit."
4,My first book by this author,I must say the author is talented. The story line is easy to follow and has just enough color to make it interesting. I am a fan of historical fiction and really like that I can not only look up unknown words but that via my Kindle I can even jump to wiki to research a topic or idea. If this book continues to please me I plan on getting the others in the series.
1,A Great Mind sheltered from Reality,"Contrary to the esteemed view most Protestants have of John Calvin, his work in these volumes suffers from what we call ""diarrhea of the pen."" Mr. Calvin clearly had an original mind (whether such was rooted in truth is another matter) but his sheltered experience in reality is demonstrated in this work. It is telling that, in contrast with Mr. Calvin's protracted discourses, God's own Son could instruct or settle disputes with merely a word or sentence and what God simply recorded as fact Mr. Calvin, rather, writes volumes. Subsequently, these verbose additions to God's revelation predisposes the argument that God's word is insufficient in the revelation of truth or in its instruction in righteousness and causes the reader to question whether Mr. Calvin's ideas originate in God or merely in man.I am certain there will be many who will disagree with me, but we are not of ""Apollos, nor Cephas, nor Luther, nor Calvin"" but we are all of Christ and His alone."
4,Muy practico,"Este producto es muy practico para cortar todo tipo de producto vegetales, carnes , pan ,embutidos... facil de usar y se puede colocar tanto en el granito (meseta ) de la cocina como en cualquier mesa rectagular ya sea perfil madera ,plastico o metal.Un punto el articulo, trae unas almoadillas de gomas transparentes para apoyarlo en la meseta algunas veces hay que reemplazarlas luego de varios usos ya que el pegamento sede creando inestabilidad a la hora de utilizarlo."
1,Vista Certified? what does that mean?,"This has been another Vista nightmare,Print spooler failure message, won't install the driver.No vista instructions."
5,my lab's favorite,"This is my 2 year old lab's absolute favorite toy - he will hardly fetch anything else. He can grab it by the rope or the semi-soft ball, and he loves to swing it around and bang himself on the back with it. I can hurl it a good long way when we play fetch, and the size gives him just a bit of a challenge when retrieving. He has played hard with it for a year, and it has been sitting in the yard in the damp when he isn't playing with it. The rope is just now starting to wear through so I'm ordering another. The other reviewer may have an extreme chewer - don't let that make you miss a great toy!"
2,Sale or seller?,"This item arrived late, with no return slip, and is the wrong size from what I ordered. Not happy about that, as I already have one this size, and I'm faulting the seller, not the product, here.Insofar as the ball itself, my Mastiff pulled the rope out almost immediately. The ball is otherwise practically indestructible -- Jolly makes a great product, the ball floats, get so many toothmarks it looks pocked, goes eventually a little out of round but never deflates, and washes off easily.pat chapin"
5,Romp-n-Roll,"This toy works perfcectly! My dog is a chewer and ate through the handle of a Jolly Pet's Tug-n-toss ball in about 10 minutes, but he loves this Romp-n-roll ball because it has a rope handle. He can chew on the rope all day without damage. He likes to chew the ball too, but I was careful to get a size larger than his mouth, so he can't destroy it. Best of all, we can throw it around the yard easily for exercise, and it rolls and bounces so that he has to run farther to get it."
2,WISH IT WAS TOUGHER,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS BEFORE AND MY DOG (MEDIUM SIZE) HAD FUN WITH IT FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN PUNCTURED IT. IT HAS BEEN AWHILE AND SHE IS OLDER, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT AGAIN. SHE PUNCTURED IT WITHIN HOURES. GREAT TOY, JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR MY DOG."
2,Not good for Large Working breeds.,My German Shepard and Boxer destroyed it playing tug of war withing minutes. I was hoping at least for a day.
4,depends on your dog,"This toy is good for dogs that like to be rough with toys, like kick them around. I've had 2 of these with 2 different pit bulls. Both very happy, energetic, like-to-play-soccer dogs. Both times the dog shredded the rope right away, so I'd suggest watching your dog carefully the first times playing with this so they don't swallow pieces of thread. It is soft enough for a large dog to chomp down on and fairly sturdy. One of my dogs just chomped on his all the time and never ripped a hole in it. Another dog started picking at the raised letters that say ""Jolly Ball"" and there's a hole there now. He doesn't seem to pick at it now that the letters are picked off. lol"
2,Sweep just stops.,"Has anyone noticed that the track ""Sweep"" just STOPS in the midst of your dancing pleasure? There's no fade out, it just ends abruptly. Can someone please tell me why?"
5,Great album,"Having been a fan of Faithless for many years, I was somewhat put off by the newest single 'Mass Destruction'. But after previewing the new album on their official website, and buying it myself, I have come to find it to be their most accomplished to date. Whether through the slick production, smooth vocals of Maxi Jazz, the guest appearance of Dido on the title track, it all works wonders. Definitely the best album I've heard so far this year."
5,a must have,"this realy for me,i caNNOT now imagine how i ever thought i could dance tribal/fusion without it.I love it,the warm up is fab,i love the way darshan ex[plains everything,very clear and helpful.my daqncing has excelled since getting this dvd."
4,another workout....,"Its a nice video, well produced and easy to follow.Intro, warm up, workout, combinations, performance... pretty standard stuff.The nice thing about this DVD is that the instructor gives some history of the art before the workout begins and helps clarify the different styles she teaches. Her primary focus is the upper body rather than the hips.Darshan is a fantastic dancer, but her instruction needs some work.Overall, the video was lackluster and it becomes ""just another bellydance video.""Its great if you have a collection of belly dance workouts and do a different one each day, or if you want to try tribal belly dance for the first time. But if you only buy one belly dance DVD in your life, this is not the one you want."
3,Passable,"I love Rankin's work, pretty much wholesale, however I've had back-to-back ""meh's"" with The Fandom of the Operator and this one, Armageddon the Musical.Neither were bad, but they just didn't work for me in the way that pretty much every other book of his has. Perhaps I'm missing Mr. Rune, perhaps this one is a bit too tangential (and I hope not, as this will mean I'm getting old), but it didn't rock me as everything else he's done has done.The book itself did come in handy during an altercation with a restaurateur and provided additional leverage to the argument in regards to the bill, adding sufficient heft without becoming deadly. Granted, it was stored in my Kindle at the time, so I should probably thank Amazon instead of Mr. Rankin."
3,Don't really know what to say,"The fundamental concept behind the book is excellent...what if Earth's history was manipulated by an outside force for the purpose of creating the biggest reality show ever?However, from there, it really starts breaking down. The story seems very disjointed until right near the end. The characters are really not very likable at all, and the author's concept of a religio-commercial war seems a bit over the top (admittedly, given that this is highly satirical in nature, probably intentional).I'm sure many people enjoyed it, but I wasn't a big fan."
3,"Interesting Parody, but Trys too hard","When I started watching this series I was not sure if I was watching parody or not, does not take itself seriously for one minute at times some of the episodes made me laugh, some scenes I found just irksome. I have not finished this series as yet, I hope it improves because I think some of the arcs could get tiresome. I liked the animation although it may appeared dated to some viewers. I found the characters interesting some of them cliche for anime but it is sort of expected for this type of series. So far The Sorcerer Hunters is not a bad anime it is just not great."
2,Waste of money,"McRaven does the ""Not worth the paper it's written on"" thing once again. If you have no idea whatsoever in how to build a log cabin, then maybe this book is for you though there are better. If you have the slightest idea on how cabins are built, don't waste your hard-earned money."
4,Only One Real Problem... type set,"I have enjoyed my varied attempts at reading this book. I enjoyed the various presentations on Stage (except Anthony Perkins replaying another bad guy doesn't work for me) My major problem lies in obtaining a large print copy (even in several volumes). Amazon has almost two pages of books, number, etc. Doesn't someone take mercy on us poor souls that don't qualify as visually impaired legally."
5,Finally a becoming bathing suit,"If you are confused about pear shape, apple shape etc, get this suit. Being a realy woman, there is not just one area to camflouge. This suit slenderizes but looks trendy at the same time. Have worn it for 2 seasons and it provides good coverage for the large bust but also slims down the hip and thunder tigh area women seem to hate."
3,Not happy...,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother when we took her on her first cruise. She really liked it, but unfortunately did not fit her very well. Apparently when you purchase items from this company, they have a ""no return"" policy. Now I'm stuck with this relatively expensive swimming suit that doesn't fit anybody I know."
4,works well enough,this product works well enough. I would recommend this respirator/cartridge to any one doing construction/demolition.
2,Advanced Math Major Needed,"Unless you're extremely fluent in advanced mathematics, calculus, etc., this book is not for the faint of heart. For those of us who never got past shop math - forget it. The formulas and calculations are enough to knock you out or at least put you to sleep. I'll give it a re-read again, but first drive through, just blew me away - sorry, math was never my strong point! Overall - 2's the best this rates for non-mathemeticians."
2,A DECENT REFRESHER BOOK,"I see where this is the 2nd edition of this book I feel that the first edition was alot better. The book has decent information covered here but it seems like a rehash of info only slightly changed by the author. To make this book better the author should know that ccd is the wave of the future and if he decides to write a 3rd book to do more research this time, some of the films mentioned are out of date."
1,anorexia,"I honestly have to say that I have not read this book, and I really don't know much about it. However, I have a friend who is on the diet, and it is all she talks about...how much weight she has lost. I realize that she is proud of it, but at our age (14), I don't really think that our weight is what we should be worrying about. I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was 13 and have been fighting it for 6 months. It has completely changed my life, and now I face the possibility of not ever growing taller than five feet and never being able to have children just because I wanted to be skinny (like Suzanne Sommers). I mean, the world practically worships skinny people. Fighting the voices in my head that say I am a fat b**** is hard enough, without having to face the pressure of seeing and having friends who read books like this. Anyway, I just wanted to say that everyone should be aware that this book can have some seriously negative effects on teenage girls."
1,HELP!,"I am a 14 year old girl and I weight 184 pounds. I'm on this diet for a week now and to be quite honest, it is killing me. I'm so restricted from many kinds of food. Since I've started I have felt alot more tired and weak. Furthermore, I have realised that I eat alot less because of the fact that I am restricted. I do want to lose wait but I just can't with this diet. If u have any ideas of a good diet please tell me! Hope to hear form you soon!"
5,"Eat Great, Lose Weight","Even though dieticians say this book is not based on science, they cannot say it is dangerous, because all the food groups and nutrients are included. I tried Atkins and got really sick of greasy food! It contains too many omega 6 fats, which are the worst fats for our health. On Somers' plan there are many more choices. I lost eight pounds the first month I tried it, which I was happy with, since fast losses often bring fast returns. We've had a house guest for six months who loved to bake great desserts, and I have no control when the smell of a peach or apple pie in the oven is wafting all over my house, so I gained ten pounds. I'm starting the plan again, and I hope I can repeat my first month and then continue losing. I am taking an effective fiber drink for the control of cholesterol, and I wonder if it is OK to take it with orange or grapefruit juice, or will that mess up keeping the fruit separate? Grapefruit, especially, isn't that sweet, so I thought it might be OK."
2,Somersizing is not for everyone.,"While the program may work for some, it is simply unrealistic for many others. For example, on level one you must eliminate all sugar and white flour. I tried to do this, but do you know how hard it is to go to the supermarket and find foods that do not have any sugar or white flour? Most foods have these things. On the program you basically have to prepare all your meals using meat, vegetables, oil and fruit while you are on level 1. Who wants to eat a hamburger without the bun anyway? And you must give up potatoes altogether. Who wants to do that? There are also a good number of other foods that you must give up altogether (at least while on level 1). Also its unrealistic for those who work long hours or students because you must prepare all your meals- you can't eat any canned or prepared foods. The complete elimination of sugar on level 1 left me lethargic and weak."
4,A reasonable way to lose weight,"Over the years I've looked at lots of diet plans. Atkins, the Zone, McDougalls, and so on. This plan is one of the more reasonable to deal with, although it's not perfect. It requires planning and thinking ahead, which can be hard when you've got a cranky family to feed, but if you give it some time it works. Just don't cheat!"
2,The pictures are pretty of Suzanne,"...but little of content in recipes. I was dis- appointed to learn that most recipes had carbohydrates and sugar...no no's. Plus, the recipes seemed to be for dinner parties, with special ingredients that I would guess most people don't keep on hand. She didn't need to remind us that she lives 'high on the hog' - come down to earth with the rest of us, Suzanne!"
5,Great Way To Loose Weight!,"I decided it was time to take off the baby weight and had tried other things with no success. This was my last effort and BOY DID IT WORK!!! At first it was way different than every diet I had tried but after a couple of weeks not only did I feel great I was beginning to see a difference. Then all of a sudden the weight came off! I lost 25lbs in less than 4 months. I HIGHLY recommend this book to EVERYONE! To help myself in the beginning I made myself 'cheat' cards, a list of what is a 'protein', what are the 'funky' foods, etc. It helped a great deal. JUST DO THIS! IT IS SOOOO EASY!"
3,diet too confusing and not really feasible for vegetarians,"I lost 11 pounds the first month but then started to gain back and am at 8 pounds lost at 6 weeks.I can't decide what to eat because many foods are a combination of carbs and proteins, and I have to guess how many of one or the other is too much. The book says yogurt is ok, but it's a combination of both, for example. I've actually been eating meat because the most protein rich food is tofu, and I just don't like it enough to eat it every day."
5,A liveable diet plan!,"I chose this book after trying the Atkin's Diet and Dr. Ornish's Diet which were both too restrictive for my eating habits. After seeing Suzanne on Regis + Kathie Lee preparing some recipes, it peaked my attention. The book was very easy and interesting to read. The recipes reflect the foods that I like to eat and seem easy to prepare. My sister, Nellie and I are excited to start Somersizing tommorow morning!!!"
3,It is well worth the try,"I am not a heavy person to begin with, But I like to be at a certain weight, I have used the Atkins diet and had sucess. I run and workout alot. I have lost 4 lbs in two weeks All I have to lose is another 4 lbs to reach my goal weight and it is harder to lose when you are so close I guess. My sisters are on the diet and so is my niece and everyone has lost over 10 lbs. Your Cravings stop after about 2-3 days and you really do not even want to cheat. My husband is on it now 5 days and has lost 4 lbs. It really works sometimes I guess depending on your body type you lose it slower. If you only have a couple pounds to lose it is a slower process but I am going to wait it out it it did take suzanne two months to get to her goal and her goal is the same as mine 116 lbs I am at 119. But everyone else who has tried has lost weight."
5,Yup. It works.,"I never would have imagined buying a diet book, much less one by a TV actress. But three months and thirty-five pounds later, I'm convinced. The sheer ease and quality of the recipes have turned out to make this our most frequently consulted cookbook (and we have a lot of them) And the biggest surprise is that Suzanne comes off as very personable and intelligent. (Okay, that one part with the bath of rose-petals was a little over the top.) I don't know how well someone can access the necessary foods for this system outside a major city, but I've certainly had no problem finding what I need to eat this way. Yes, you have to plan, and you have to enjoy cooking-- at least on weekends, but it's not rocket science. After a week or two, it's completely easy. And it truly works. Even if you still have a glass of wine with dinner. Do yourself a favor and buy it for the recipes alone. You're likely to find yourself gaining energy and losing weight."
3,Not as good as the 2nd and 3rd books,"This is the first of the three ""Somersize"" books. It explains the program in the most detail, but honestly its a very boring read and the recipes are not practicle. I found the second book ""Get Skinny on Fabulous Food"" to be much more interesting and the recipes are things that I actual make (the Chinese Chicken Salad is excellent). The second book also explains the basics of the plan, but in a more condensed form so you don't have to read a bunch of in depth explanation like you do in ""Eat Great, Lose Weight"". If you haven't read any of the books and are looking for the *best* of the three then I wouldn't recommend this one. Go with ""Get Skinny"" or the newer ""Eat, Cheat and Melt the fat away""."
3,Go to Know,"Reading this book reminded me that film adaptations never achieve the wholeness of the written story. There are many facts in this book that the movie never touches. Malcom X shares a lot about himself in this book, but I was wanting more. Perhaps I should read some of his speeches."
5,The Greatest,"One of the best books ever written, it is a must read for a young man and any one who loves them"
3,Irritated,"Good quality product,but I was told that I would recieve it by a certain date and it did not comes till days after that. Very irritated since I payed more to have it shipped prime so I could do my homework assignment, and it came days after that."
1,New formula no longer works,"My wife used to purchase Deer Off at a local landscaping store, and there was no question that it worked. We have a lot of deer in our area, and if she kept our plants sprayed right after a heavy rain washed things off, the deer didn't bother the plants. If she forgot, it only took a day or two before the deer ate the plants.The local store stopped carrying Deer Off this year, so I decided to purchase it on Amazon. When I got it, my wife noticed that the color of the concentrate was different than before. It seems that they have a new formula, and it DOESN'T work! (Their website confirms that they have ""improved"" their formula.) I contacted the Havahart company directly to see if they would trade me for the old formula, but they didn't even answer my email. I strongly suggest that you stay away from this product unless they return to their original, proven, formula."
3,Not happy I had to finish manufacturing this product before I could use it!,"So far no shrub damage. Difficult to spray. Clogs sprayer. After spending more than $200.00 for a 2 1/2 gal jug, I didn't think I would have to take the time to prep it so it could be sprayed ( strain all the garbage out of it so it won't clog my sprayer)"
1,bad copy,"Even though others have pointed this out, Amazon is still selling a terrible copy of this movie which contains commercials. And not just commercials, but commercials that play across the top of the movie while the dance numbers are going on. The copy I got was sent by Dancing Dolphin(Lola's Dream), and I will never buy from them again. You can tell if you've gotten a bad copy by the following: If the upper right-hand corner has ""Movies on Demand"" written on it, and the back has the words ""Akai"" and ""Air-Tel"" written in red, then just send it back without opening it. Also, the dvd case is cheap cardboard rather than plastic. There is such a problem with some copies of Bollywood movies, that I hope people will describe what the outside cases look like when posting reviews so that others won't be stuck with cheap copies."
4,"Great dancing, great laughs","For the first time, Bollywood has made a movie making fun of itself. The unrealistic, super-dramatic action, the crazy dance sequences, the random bursting into song, the mistaken identity, and of course Shahrukh. Farah Khan has completely outdone herself here. The music is phenomenal and so is the dancing. This is a great movie to engage friends who tend to not enjoy watching a movie for four hours because the plot is good and the characters extremely likable. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I have."
1,Poor review,"I love this movie, but the quality was awful!!!! Honestly, it's more efficient to watch the movie online...the quality might even be better. The images get really distorted and I sent it back immediately. Don't get discourage though, there are definitely better versions out there; I just don't know where. I recommend the movie, but do not buy it from amazon!"
4,Nice Liner to create halo effect on top of a darker liner such as black.,This can be used right on top of your black eyeliner to create a halo effect and the glitters stays in place and looks pretty. You can also use this as a shadow base and apply sparkly powders on top.
3,Irritatingly Oversimplified,"I wouldn't recommend this product because the guide that comes with it is very general and only provides instructions for hanging a small picture or mirror. It does not tell you what you need to know about hanging a medium or large picture, for example, how to choose the proper hooks and anchors depending upon wall type."
4,Symbolically delicious,"Seaumus Deane's Reading In The Dark is a captivating novel vividly evoking Irish history and religious differences through the eyes of a young child growing up in the conflict-torn Derry. Symbolically delicious and even historically accurate, a must read for all Irish literature and history fanatics. Although occasionally humorous, Deane ultimately exposes the sad realities of Irish oppression in their own land."
3,Reading in the Dark,"Brett MulvaneyRecently, I just finished reading the book Reading in the Dark, a novel by Seamus Deane. What I understand from this book is that the boy narrator is having a tough time growing up in Northern Ireland, haunted by the truth of his family. Some things he wants to believe and the rest he doesn't want to. I did not particularly care for this book because of how hard it is for me to follow. Other than the constant jumping around from different scenes and scenarios, it is a good book as far as the context is concerned.I would recommend this book to people who are interested in Irish history, what people live like around that time. Another thing that might interest people would be how parents discipline their kids when they got in trouble. Also people who like books that jump around so much that it is hard for people like me to follow might enjoy the challenge."
3,THIS IS NOT ANGELA'S ASHES...It Reads More Like A Leaf Floating on an Autumn Stream,"Well, this is NOTAngela's Ashes, the trunk of the story, is weak, its branches are sometimes interesting and gripping, but all and all this tale is a meandering conversation in front of a coal fire, now a good chat, like a nice cup of tea is pleasurable, but not as addicting as coffee...maybe I am too much of a Yank to weave the subtleties with my limited American perspective of The Troubles...the most interesting tale wasn't fully developed or finished. In conclusion, if you have all the time in the world, read it, if you haven't an infinite amount of leisure...now is the time to readAngela's Ashes."
1,"Poorly written, adds nothing meaningful to his first book","I read Healing the Family Tree way back when it first came out and it added an important dimension to my prayer life. I eagerly awaited this, but ended up throwing it in the recycle in disgust. McAll is a very poor writer. It was only the power of the new ideas he put in his first book that made it so compelling. This book added nothing new and it is so badly written that it isn't even a good review of the material. I wish they'd skipped this project and instead put time into publishing a new, well-written edition of Healing the Family Tree."
1,Garbage,"Expensive, small ink tanks. I don't use this printer much, but it didn't last even two years before the paper quit feeding. Even before that I had to remove the black ink cartridge every time I started the printer and then put it back in because the printer said it wasn't there. I bought this to replace a 7 year old Epson. Now, I am using the Epson again until I replace the junk Canon. I have owned several brands of printers. This is the most expensive to use, quickest dying printer I have ever had. Also, colors that print fine on other printers had an off-hue cast on the Canon. This was a mistake. I bought the Canon because I have used their cameras for 27 years. They don't make printers as well as Cameras. No more Canon printers for me. I am back to Epson or HP."
1,Do Not Buy This Printer!,"I would HIGHLY recommend buying another printer than this piece of s&#*. It worked fine for the first few weeks, then it suddenly kept coming up with an error message that cannot be bypassed. The Canon tech support was not helpful in the least, and I ended up having to buy a whole new set of ink cartridges. Very disappointed with this product and Canon in general."
2,all green,my pictures are awful... all green hued... maybe I am supposed to make adjustments - I haven't read the manual... but out of the box the pictures are hideous...
5,Great Photo printer,Great product. I am an event photographer and this printer creates prints that rival photo labs.
2,A very bashing book of the Reagan addministration,Seems that all the book does is Talk bad about the reagan years and the Republicans. I think that the author needs to come back and look at other years under different presidents.
2,Great Expectaions result in disappointment,"After falling in lust with Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep in ""The Mummy"", I quickly tried to find more films with him in them. Unfortunately he was unable to raise the believability and entertainment level in this movie, although he does portray a sexy yet chilling serial killer. With such talented actors as Vosloo and Gary Busey, I was expecting a decent movie, but as soon as I saw Michael Madsen was in it, I should have realized it wasn't even a B movie. It was worth watching only because of the screen time Arnold is in it . If you are not a Vosloo fan, take my advice and skip it!! There are better ways to spend a couple of hours - chiefly, seeing ""The Mummy"" yet again in a comfortable air conditioned movie theatre."
1,Borrow it if you must . . .,"While MISS UNDERSTANDING is riotously funny at times (one chapter about her first day of school had me nearly in tears, I laughed so hard), the joke just plain got too complicated and too old. This is one of few books that I didn't bother to finish. It just stopped being funny, and I have a long list of books to move on to."
1,Falls apart,"Mont blanc pens I guess are best kept behind a glass case. Although their ink cartridges roll well and feel fluid, their pens fall apart too easily for their price range.I've had mine for a month, and new pieces fall off everyday. It's pathetic."
2,Divorcio,"The book is good, but the seller took it from a Library and the book is very used and it no good conditions."
3,A good resource book,"As the title states, this book provides good ideas for 5-minute children's sermons that correlate with sermons that follow the lectionary series (year B). I liked the suggestions in the foreward about how to present sermons to children. Also, the scripture index is helpful. However, the sermons are not as complete, or scripted, as other available resources. This is a good starting point for preparing children's sermons, but you will have to add to the ideas to have a complete sermon."
2,Interesting but not enough.............,"As a black woman I am not fully happy with some of the black writers out there and so I never truly ventured into a lot of black genre. ""He is just a friend"" caught my eye after I read the plot on the front jacket. Fancy is the main character in the book. She is a woman you love to hate. She has sex with men to keep her expensive lifestyle. Desmond a brother who truly cares for her she ignores because he is a mechanic and she only calls him when she is in trouble.The characters I ended up liking was Savoy and Tyronne. Savoy is a religious sister who is a virgin and is saving herself. She begins to be attracted to Tyronne who is considered a bad boy. What I like about these characters were when Tyronne found out Savoy cared about him he did not take advantage of her he took his time, at one point he told her she was too good for him. In conclusion I was not fully happy with the ending but I like that Savoy and Tyronne ended up together."
2,Disappointed!!!,"I have always heard great things about Ms. Morrison's books, so I was eager to give this one a try. Big mistake!!! The plot is the same old, tired tale of using sex for money, men and women dogging each other out, cheating, lying, etc. While all of these elements have the potential to make a good story, they just didn't work in this book. You find yourself not caring about the characters at all; there was no depth. Instead of spending so much time focusing on Savoy exploration of her sexuality, more time should have been spent on Fancy's inner demons, other than a cursory view of her mother's past relationships with men. I may try to read some of the earlier books that I've heard so much about. However, I caution fellow readers to perhaps try those books first before investing in this hardcover."
2,I have to disagree with the other reviews.,"I'm only about halfway through this book, so I'll admit my review may be a little biased at this point. But this book, so far, isn't all everyones's cracking it up to be. Granted it will keep you reading, but the characters seem underveloped. Fancy is a mess, Desmond doesn't make any sense at all. But SaVoy is the one that confuses me the most. Why does she come off like a 14 year old rather than a grown woman? (How are old these characters supposed to be anyway?)Furthermore, she's supposed to be the devout Christian and church girl out of the three girlfriends, but she seems more confused about religion and her celibacy than not. I guess maybe I should've read the previous novels because this one lost me. I would suggest picking this one up from the library if you haven't read and loved the others first."
4,Looking For Love in All the wrong people,"He's Just a Friend is a very good example how Fancy was lookingfor Love in all the wrong people.She had the love she needed right before her.It was to bad she only thought of Desmond as Just a Friend. Just a friend would not have done the things Desmond did for her. While I did not want Carlita to be more than just a friend for Desmond .I thought Savoy would have been a better mate if it was not going to be Fancy. This is one story that I would say needs to come with a warning ,it was a hot one to have handled. Which is the case in all of all of Mary's work.It's was certainly a 4.5* in my book. Mary please keep the heat coming in your books. Any enjoyable hot,and spicey, page turning read."
5,Still the best!,"25 years later, Halpern's book is the standard in this area. With easy to understand text, he spins a behavior type that is dead-on. Many readers will recognize aspects of themselves in his vignettes. The trick, of course, is to get past these behaviors so that one can have meaningful, loving relationships. I recommend this book to clients and the general reading public wholeheartedly."
2,A good neo-Freudian approach but not my cup-of-tea.,"The psychological approach taken by this book is very sound, if a little old-fashioned. To boil down its content into a few key themes one might say that it deals with the classic Freudian concepts of oral fixation and the Oedipus complex. I have never been a fan of Freudian psychology but for some such an approach can and does work. The book's great strength is in the real world examples taken from the clinical experiences of its author, Dr Halpern. There are many down-to-earth situations examined in the book and concrete, and possibly useful, management techniques described. The book is by and large easy to read. However, those of a non-American background will wince at many of the prefixes and derivational suffixes used by Dr Halpern. I remember reading words such as ""demandingness"" and ""untriumph"", just to name a couple! This book could be of practical use to some but for me it was of little assistance."
5,Outstanding and addictive,"While I have only recently become a Stan Kenton fan, I would recommend this album to ANYONE who appreciates jazz. It combines the hard-hitting brass that was Kenton's signature with the Latin rhythms (mentioned above) that swing nicely. The Johnny Richards arrangements and compositions really create an album that you will want to listen to all the way through -- LOUDLY! Critics held mixed views of some of Kenton's work, but I have yet to hear of anyone who would give this less than five stars.If you have not yet listened to Stan Kenton, this is a great place to start. 'Cuban Fire' is energetic and innovative without going off the edge of experimentation. I have come to seriously enjoy Kenton's music on many albums, but this is good enough to be one of my 'desert island' selections. Even the bonus tracks are welcome, as they essentially maintain the style of the original album. Highly recommended."
3,just another interpretation,"ok, some love this and other hate it. fair enough. i personally quite liked the don henley version of 'everybody knows'. bono on 'halelujah' sounded as if his trousers were hitched up too high and too tight. and willie nelson's 'bird on a wire' could have been a nashille chestnut like 'she'll have to go'.cohen can write. at least there doesnt seem to be any doubt about that. and perhaps he does have an honest voice. maybe robert frost had an honest voice too. never heard him sing.sunu charles"
5,Leonard Cohen,"I like hearing Leonard Cohen songs performed by many different singers. His songs are always interesting, but his singing voice is not great."
4,sound great,This sub sounds great in the right enclosure with the proper amp and surround speaker's.I fell in love with them.
1,NOT GOOD,"PYLE PLD15WD 15-Inch 4000 Watt DVC SubwooferTHIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAD. THE FIRST ONE BLEW THE SECOND DAY I USED IT. I RETURNED IT AND RECIEVED ANOTHER ONE. I RE-INSTALLED THE SECOND ONE, IN LESS THAN A WEEK IT BLEW AS WELL. IT WAS INSTALLED IN A BOX BUILT TO PYLE'S RECOMMENDED SPECS. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE."
1,Terrible price!,"Amazon has always been excellent for pricing. However, I expected to get at least 2 bottles of sprinkles for $6. I just got 1. They are under $3 in the stores. I won't be ordering sprinkles again from Amazon, needless to say."
5,"Hil St.Soul Has ""Organic Soul""","Hil St. Soul is one of the most talented soul singers that i've ever heard. Her song ""Until You Come Back To Me"" is one of the most serious soul songs that i've ever heard.The song includes strong vocals, nice lyrics, and nice production. I'd say Hil St. Soul could top most of the U.S. female R&B singers."
5,Must See Truthvision,"There are essentially three parts of the puzzle that makes up the decline and fall of the US and quite possibly the planet itself. The corruption of the government, the corruption of multinational corporations, and the corruption of the media... this movie adequately exposes the last part- the media-and works well in it's depiction of the connections to the other two. Essential education for the masses. Learn the truth behind the 1996 telecommunication act that gave the green light to monopolization of media... and the wholescale buyup of our airwaves... with little selection... we are fed ""news""... with little or no supervision as to the truth, morality and ethics behind the news story choices and the outright bias and manipulation we now call broadcast journalism. Also See the Corporation, Future of Food, and Manufacturing Consent."
2,Same problem here,"It would be great if it worked. Bought it 2005, used it about 6 times and same thing, stopped spinning, then all lights flash when turned on. My use was intermittent and so was the problem at first so by the time it went completely out it was past the warranty. I'm sending it in now for repair, we'll see what the cost is."
2,cst/berger57-lm30,"I used this product may be 2 or 3 times a year. Same problem as others, Took it out to use and it failed to work. All lights started flashing.Emailed customer support who failed to answer the main question as to the cost of repair. Another case of built in obsolescence. Based on others having similar problems the company should know what is wrong with the unit and give better advise options for repair, and, or replacement options."
3,Basic Information,"This book contains a very no frills presentation of the Russian Svr. Not quite what I expected. It does give a basic overview, so if short and sweet is what you're looking for then this book is good. If you want to get more in-depth this book is not the way to get there."
2,Terrible choice of vocab + no book = mostly useless,"In the first two hours of Pimsleur Czech, I learned to have the following conversation (these are ACTUAL PHRASES from this course):""Excuse me.""""Yes?""""Where is Wenceslas Square?""""It's here.""""Are you American?""""No, I'm Czech.""""Do you want to go get something to drink? At my hotel? Maybe later?""Seriously, Pimsleur, do you really think I'm going to the Czech Republic to hit on people? Why not give us vocabulary we tourists actually need, like ""Two tickets to Cesky Krumlov, please"" or ""do you have a menu in English?""And it's a huge mistake not to include any written materials at all with this course. I can learn far more quickly when I can see and hear the words at the same time. My guess is including a printed supplement would make it painfully obvious how little this course is actually teaching you.In short: don't buy this. I learned more from my guidebook's small supplement of helpful phrases than I learned from this ""course."""
5,two great bands make one great album,"this is perhaps the best record of its genre to come out other than possibly the latest melpo mene record (a great band out of sweden). somehow these two bands integrate their sounds so seamlessly that they have created an entirely new sound you wouldn't have guessed either one of them had something to do with, other than the familiar vocals. this is one of those albums that makes their more popular predecessors probably wish they had made it, and also makes them realize they probably never could."
1,Dissapointing,"This is the first book by Johanna Lindsey that I have read. I had heard such good things about her, that I was eager to give it a try. From the very beginning, there is little romance in the story, and even less passion. The more that I read, the more I began to hate the characters. About two-thirds of the way through the book, I just put it down. For those of you who think Lindsey is the ""Queen of Romance,"" try reading a book by Susan Johnson. I guarantee you'll be converted."
5,I Loved this book!,"It just goes to show everyone has different tastes. I am not a dedicated Johanna Lindsey fan, but I LOVED this book. I have read it several times and have loaned it out to friends, who also loved it."
5,A great read. She really brought the characters to life.,"Johanna Lindsey is by far, my favorite historical romance novelist. The way she sets her stories are just fantastic. I especially loved this book. The humor in it was real. I mean it even made me laugh. I have read every single one of her books, and I have never been disappointed in any of them. This book is no exception."
5,Hope No Matter What,"This book was heart wrenching as well as heart hoping. So many of us dwell in guilt and agony. Few of us have the guts and heart it takes to believe that there is hope for the future. This book was a testament to living through agony, suffering from guilt, and knowing that the future holds the promise of happiness. The fact that every day there is a chance that the phone will ring with news of utter loss and we somehow find the courage to endure is what this book brings to us. Hope, love, and happiness....imagine."
3,"Sounds OK, but very short tracks","You can get an idea of the sound by listing to the samples here. Too bad the track listing on the website doesn't include the times. I specifically bought this hoping to find a long version of ""Master in this Hall"". Fortunately I read the lable before opening the CD, that cut is only 53 seconds! Most of the cuts on this CD are under 2 minutes in length, and several are less than one minute. (""Patapan"" is only 42 seconds) You basically get enough music for one verse. OK for background music (at low volume) but I find little use for it otherwise."
4,Baby's at their best!,"This is a great album! I've had it since it was released. By far the best song is ""Everytime I Think Of You"". It's one of those songs to crank up loud! It charted As high as #13 on The Billboard top 40 in 2/79. I saw The Baby's in concert when this album was popular-what a great show. The album still holds up well to the test of time! Other highlights include: ""I Was One"", ""Love Don't Prove I'm Right"", ""Run To Mexico"", and ""Head First""."
2,Not what I expected,"I had read that Machen's writing inspired HP Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, so I bought a collection of his horror stories and this book. I finally got around to reading it and I found it to be a long winded story of a writer or someone who goes on and on, page after page, defining what he thinks literature is or is not. May be interesting to some, but I skimmed through the book as best I could (not set up with a working ebook index at all). The best I could tell there really was no story at all, just this long speach about defining literature. Is a newspaper article literature? How about advertising brochures? Anyway, I abandoned it as soon as I realized there was nothing else to the book. Since there were no reviews of any kind about this book, I assumed it was like his other stories, a couple of which I have read."
2,Too short........,"Could have been a good show but, it was way too short! About two children befriending a German POW on a train in the mid-west during WWII, it stops short of possible being worth watching. Would not recommended.Bruce"
5,Cornelio Reyna,"This is an awesome cd. It contains some of Cornelio's most popular and original versions of his songs. I highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Cornelio's music, I love it."
2,Don't expect tutorials OR detailed information...,"3D Modelling and Texturing book in this Inspired 3D series was more of a book that describes the different modelling processes used in the industry, and pre-visulation method which is important. It gave the basic concepts behind modelling and texturing... but was lacking in tutorials/examples that you can do along with the book to establish a good understanding.Do not buy this book if you are looking for tutorials or examples on how they achieve the look in production environment. You will find more useful information on the web in tutorials or playing around in Maya yourself."
2,not worth the price,This book goes over very basic concepts that you should easily be able to find in the manual of your software. Save yourself the money.
4,A Wonderful Journey,"The Hathor Material is a wonderful journey into: knowing ourselves as multi-dimensional beings, honoring all aspects of our innate humanness with many very practical approaches to raising personal and planetary consciousness. Deeply inspiring, a transmission of energy and Light."
2,Tepid at Best,"When I hear the word ""erotica"" i think ""hot and steamy."" This book was tepid at best. After reading Kathleen E. Morris' ""The Princess and the Cop"" on kuma2.net, I thought this book would be just as good. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed with it that I toyed with the idea of returning or exchanging it."
4,FUN STUFF!!!,"This has some pretty cool old music on it. Stuff you may have missed. Not as good as LOUIS JORDAN, but in the same vein.....LOTS OF FUN!"
5,This book is life changing!!!,"This book will change your life! The principles described really work! If you have a dream and would like to achieve it, this is the book for you!"
5,"Easy, awesome read!",I read the book first and then bought it on audio and loved it both times! It's an easy read that will have you captivated from the first chapter. It pulls you out of a rut and helps you to see with different eyes. There is abundance in everything and anything is possible in life if you follow her steps to achieve them. I would recommend this book to anyone.
3,works well until it cracks,worked great for a few times--then it broke. don't use hot water on the plastic when it's frozen--it'll crack. lukewarm is the furthest i'd go.
2,Great concept - poor execution,"I just can't get behind this. It's a great idea but just too hard to use. No thought in the construction ""yeah, we'll make a plastic box to fill with water"". Lips on the edges to at least HELP prevent spills would be nice.Imagine yourself filling this thing with water (12-14lbs) up to the very EDGE, and then having to lift it up, over, and into your freezer. I would like to hear from anyone who hasn't layered the bottom of their freezer with ice after using this."
5,Hit of the party!,"I bought one of these at a garage sale. This thing couldn't be easier to use, simply fill to the line and let freeze (about 24hrs). The trick to remove the ice is let it sit on the counter for about a half hour, then flip it over. Do not run water over it or try to force the block out, the ice will crack and so will the mold. I have made about a dozen without a single problem.I made a rack where I can stack three at a time, like water falls where it will flow from to the other, talk about a brain freeze! I can fit 5 of these in a cooler so the lugeing never stops!"
2,The Early Germans - Better books are available,"In my opinion, Mr. Todd writes books by some type of writing formula. No matter the subject, He uses the same source material for each of his books. I find them shallow and sophmoric. They are like an expanded version of a college freshman term paper."
3,Surprisingly fascinating!,"Considering it was just a narrated tour, and quite long at that, I found myself loving every minute it. Of course, I am a diehard Elvis fan and love anything about Elvis, so take my response in that light. If you are not a big fan, you may not find this DVD too entertaining."
1,No Sound Clips,Too bad this doesn't have sound clips so that we can hear a sample before buying...I'd never buy a CD without hearing it first.
3,"Good but, I saw all skits",in original episodes. even Chris Rock who is not often funny was funny in these skits. Would only watch once. No subtitles.
5,the best of the leader books,"Having read about 6 leadership books in a row, I can say with this limited perspective that this is the best overall. These are great essays by a wide variety of major leaders -- every person has something significant to say about leadership and taken together, the reader can put together a detailed and rich picture about what makes a real leader. One encouraging thought is that great leaders benefit by having and creating other leaders -- no need to fear too many good leaders. So, everyone can benefit by learning how to become a leader and the change will be better for everyone involved. Each essay is short, so taken together, they are very digestible. The writing is good all around, but it's really the insights and examples from proven leaders that makes this so easy to use as a blueprint or study of leadership. Top notch ideas, well presented. Any one who serves or hopes to serve as a leader would do well by reading this book."
1,Urotscruciating,"This film ruined anime's image The animation is substandard, the plot is fatuous, the characters are inane, and having to sit through endless boring, insipid scenes of tentacle copulation is about as pleasant as antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis. I'm not offended by it morally; it just seems to be made by and for wankers. I don't mind sex, violence, blood, guts, and profanity, but Legend of the Overfiend brings the transgression of acute vapidity to a level that has never before been seen. Oh, and here's a shocker: Tokyo is destroyed. Which of course is a plot twist drenched in originality. ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN? Everyone else, enjoy. It doesn't get any worse than this."
4,Excellent,"I think that the HD is in progress, because when I record in HD HQ, I can't edit the recorded material in the cam before finished the DVD.I don't have been used all the facilities of the cam recorder.Thanks."
4,"Disturbing, but worthwhile","Being very familiar with the Leo Frank case and the various forms of media that have evolved concerning it (novels, plays, movies, musicals...etc.) I was anxious to see what slant Mamet would take on this most intriguing true story. As usual, Mamet offers a bizarre, disturbing and profoundly intellectual work that provides a whole new look at Leo Frank. Instead of focusing in on the trial or events surrounding it...Mamet takes us on a journey inside Frank's head...we see the mind of a man displaced; trying to make peace with himself, his world and his God. The result is not a page-turner, not a heartfelt and moving account of a man accused, but rather a facsinating examination of the human brain and it's inexplicable way of relating ideas. A worthwhile read for anyone familiar with the Frank case...but a little too heavy and vague for those who are not."
2,an historicl novel with inaccuracies - pretentious,"Bologna is not in Spain. Czechoslavakia did not exist in 1914 . Leo Frank was real - David Mamet is real - the pretetious ramblings of the imaginary Leo Frank are neither philosophically or theologically enlightening , entertaining or profound . For a fictional treatment of the Frank Case , try Kluger's"" Member of the Tribe"" . Rabbi Arnold Mark Belzer"
5,Great batteries,I have been using these batteries in a digital camera (Olympus SP-510) and am very satisifed with these batteries. I would buy these batteries again.Also purchased and use with the Sony BCG-34HRMF4 Super Quick Charger with LCD Indicator and 4 AA Batteries.These are 2500mAh batteries.
5,The best batteries I've found for my digital camera,"I've had my Canon Powershot A85 for almost 2 years. I've bought several different brands of ""high-power"" rechargeables for it, and these are by far the best I've used. They just do their job, period. The case is great, too, very handy. A great product. If you need a charger, the one that is sold with these elsewhere on Amazon is also a great product."
3,A decent start,"This book is not detail or very descriptive as a how-to guide, but there are some good creative ideas, if you can see ahead and personally know how to expand on them. I was slightly disappointed after reading the Penny Whistle party planner and birthday planner, and the Family Fun Parties. But since I bought at a discount bookstore online for $..., it was adequate. I use it for coming up with ideas and expand from there to other resources are the internet."
4,It's a Great Story_ Not instruction though,I loved this book...but it doesn't teach you how to work with horses on a lessons or step-by-step basis. He talks a lot about the way we should be with horses and how horses are. And it does have some instructional ideas. I was actually able to identify a problem with a horse of mine through it(herdbound). Like I say...it's a wonderful read and great story. But it is not an instructional book. So just be ready for whatcha get. :) But I love to read so I would suggest it to anyone who love horses.
5,The Faraway Horses,"I bought this book because I really like Buck Brannaman's method of horse training and wanted to learn more about it and also more about his life. I sure got what I wanted! It's a very interesting life story about how Buck came out on top after years of abuse at the hands of his father because he chose to take those negative experiences and apply them in a positive way to something he was passionate about: helping horses and therefore, helping their people. Some of the stories have had me to the point of tears a few times throughout the book and others made me laugh. You don't find people as genuine and caring as Buck anymore and even if you aren't much into horses, I would suggest this book simply for the healing abilities it can give you for your own problems. Buck Brannaman is a hell of a guy and I think this book has a lot to offer just about everyone."
5,If You Love Horses,This was excellently written and kept your attention. Having been in that part of Montana just three years ago I could picture each place he talked about. Good purchase.
2,"Beautiful printing, scanner didn't work","I had to return this printer due to the scanner not working since an error message said it couldn't communicate with the PC. Canon's online tech notes, and e-mail support (4 rounds), and a 45-minute phone call did not help. They just had me try different USB ports, uninstall and reinstall the software, and were wary of my 6' USB 2.0 cable, telling me that I needed a 4' gold-plated cable instead. I've never had a USB problem before with any other product.They finally sent me a replacement (an upgraded unit, the MP180), but it exhibited the same problem. Both were reburbished units, but I think the Canon drivers have a problem.I finally bought the Lexmark 2500 and it works fine.The MP160 prints beautifully, however.The Amazon distributor who sold me the original MP160 was very good to work with."
2,Halloween anyone?,"While I certainly wasn't expecting NFL quality, this set is more on the level of a cheap Halloween costume than anything resembling a uniform. A fair price point would be around $25 not $45.The helmet is thin plastic with packing grade foam inserts...a red sticker declares ""not protective head gear""...no kidding. The poly-blend uniform could not be cheaper in feel and appearance. Again, you don't expect top of the line gear for a kid's set, but I wouldn't shell out $45 for a Halloween costume for an 8yr. old. And if I did, it would have to be a lot more impressive than this product.I want to add that when the seller became aware of my disappointment they were very responsive and offered a refund and to pay for return shipping. They also located and sent a chin strap that was missing for the set. Good people (I would give them 5 stars but the review is aimed at the uniform)...a cheap, yet overpriced, product."
1,Working doesn't work for me!,"This is a terrible, dated 70's version of the musical. I was so disappointed when I watched it. h Only half the music is in there and the same goes for the monologues. Really bad, REALLY, REALLY BAD."
5,Miracle in a Blade of Grass,"I love this book! It came at the perfect time of my life when I was searching for meaning in tragedy. It made me laugh, made me cry and made me see that God's infinite plan is simple if seen through the eyes of the innocent. If you want to feel good, pick it up and spend a weekend with this perfect companion.Teri Bayus"
4,Kylie's Disco,"Kylie's 2000 album LIGHT YEARS was a departure from her badly received but creatively successful 1997 album IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS. This is a genuine throwback to the 70's and the disco era. It opens with the hits ""Spinning Around"" and ""On A Night Like This"". The songs on this album will make you want to move and dance and sing along. ""So Now Goodbye"" and ""Disco Down"" are adorable songs that should be considered Kylie classics. ""Butterfly"" was a promo single in the US. The other singles from the album were ""Your Disco Needs You"", a campy fun song, and the cash in on the Latin craze at the time titled ""Please Stay"", which I cannot stand. It's any wonder why it was a single when there were clearly better choices. Another song that doesn't do it for me is the Robbie Williams duet ""Kids"", and ""Bittersweet Goodbye"", the albums only ballad, seems out of place. Another great track is the title track. Overall a fun campy album Kylie fans will love, definately a favorite of mine."
3,"Perfect for Xbox 360 controllers, Not so good for PS3 controllers","If I was reviewing just for Xbox 360 then 5 stars all the way! It works perfectly. However, the standard Dualshock PS3 controllers just don't fit very well especially if you plug it up to charge with a USB cable. Just trying to hang it on the rack often results in the PS3 controller falling off and bouncing on the floor. And Wii controllers, forgetaboutit! I have multiple systems and many controllers so I love it for storing 4 Xbox 360 controllers.If anybody from the company reads this review, please make a new rack just for PS3 and a new rack just for the Wii controllers! Put me down for one of each!"
2,"Good premise, question tactics","Although my daughters asked to read this book more than once when we took it out from the library, I questioned the wording in some parts. If you, like myself encourage not using hurtful words like stupid and I'll kill you, you might find yourself revising those sections while reading."
2,LETS HANG THE EDITOR !!,"This could have been such an awesome dvd, with the opportunity to have corrected the ruining of the songs with interviews thus separating them rather than mixing them into the music, once again they drop the ball on this one and released it the same as they did on the vhs version. How Sabbath could have agreed to have such a great concert ruined is beyond me. Out of the 14 song set I regret to tell you there are only 5 unruined songs by interviews, they are: war pigs, after forever, dirty women, children of the grave and paranoid. a mere taste of what might have been. I strongly suggest this dvd gets re-edited and put out the way the fans who pay their hard earned money....DESERVE !"
3,Must have DVD for Sabbath fans? Probably.,"The real Black Sabbath together again! Doing some of their classic material. Good sound and video, decent DVD transfer.Unexpected plus: It is wide-screen format instead of full screen.Unexpected minus: There are points where songs are interupted or faded into the background while bandmembers talk about them. This is totally unnecessary, they could have easily kept the songs intact by making the video several minutes longer or by better using available DVD technology. This was annoying the first time and will be more so in repeat viewings. You may want to rent it first to see how much this might bother you.What should and could have been a 5 star video. However, the producers failed to properly take repeat viewing into consideration."
2,Song cutting (Bad idea),"I agree with the reviews I have read, cutting into the songs with those stupid interviews was a bad idea maybe the people in charge will see how ticked-off the fans are and re-call this DVD and re-work it. The person who decided to cut into the songs with these interiews should lose his/her job or at least have their head examined"
2,Huge Disappointment,As with most of the other reviews I was really disappointed in the interruptions of the songs by interviews. This is already destined for the next garage sale. I am disappointed since I really am a fan (still have their vinyl albums) and was hoping for great undiluted music. Don't buy it.
3,music or interview DVD????,"i bought this DVD thinking. hey live black sabbath. i was wrong. yes it does have like ""cuts"". but during the live sets they minimize the screen and have an interview with a band member. not the best thing to do. i was very upset when they were singing the first song and all of a sudden the screen went small and they went to an overdubbed interview. nice if you seen them live before and just want the interview about ""why we wrote this song"" or ""how we came up with the name for N.I.B."""
3,The flexibility of a VHS,"I agree, Black Sabbath is a great band, ok.But this DVD is flexible as a VHS. When you are listening and seeing Snowblind, the music STOPS, the show STOPS, and a new scene comes - they start to TALK, to give an interview...you can't turn off the interview AND there is no subtitles ! I don't want to listen the interviews, I want to see the show ! And the same thing happens with almost all other songs. I want a recall !! They should learn with 5-stars Metallica S&M ! What a DVD !"
2,PLEASE! Re-release this product using another producer,He Mr. producer: learn something from the real fans: NEVER interrupt songs in a video again. I can't enjoy it now. Without this it would be a 4 or 5 star DVD. Too bad...
2,What on Earth was going through their minds?!!!,"1999 and here we were at last with the first offical Black Sabbath DVD. And tiwh the classic line-up. And with the band with top form. And with a great set list. BUt everything was ruined. Why?For the first time in the history of DVDs containing live performances, ALL the songs are interrupted by an interview right in the middle! That's it! You heard me well! INtead of putting the interviews as a bonus feature, they inserted them inside the concert... Clever editors..."
3,Barely 3 stars ... Cut the damn interviews,"I loved the picture quality and the dolby surround sound that this DVD offered. The sound is very well detailed as at captures all the trills and bends on Iommi's guitar which is something I did not hear to well on the music CD version. Now to the negative part, what is up with the producers cutting in with interviews during the concert performances? I was ready to kick the screen in when they cut it on Black Sabbaths performance of Black Sabbath (the song).Why couldn't that be done before or after the performance? is the label so hard up to sell the Reunion CD that they chose to diminish the video concert performances on this DVD? thats the only reason I can think of as to why they chose to bastardize these peformances. This deserved to be a fully unedited concert DVD since Sabbath being the mega band that had'nt released once before. These record labels are some greedy mofo's for intentionally trying to screw loyal fans in this way."
4,Jawbone,"If I read correctly, I think the previous reviewer is confused about how the Jawbone works. The Jawbone does not reduce your background noise level. What you hear in the background remains the same regardless of environment. However, the Jawbone does reduce what the person on the other end of the line hears that's in your background. Using the previous reviewer's nightclub environment as an example... whoever he talks to (a) will not hear the nightclub music as loudly and (b) will be able to hear his voice more clearly (as noted by the previous reviewer)."
4,It's posible to study ETA using statistics!,"An extraordinary vision of ETA evolution through the 60s and 70s. The fights, the politics and the repressions are observed by a new angle: the statistic data that the organization leave behind. Following other titles of Robert P. Clark, this book is essential for anyone that is interested in ETA and in the Basque country. Be aware: after you read this book, your perception of this terrorist organization will probably change. By Gonalo Pereira"
4,Great layout,Great layout and easy for a HS student to do and work thru as they prepare for the SAT.
2,Disappointed,"This updated version of the text has been torturous for my current 9th grade students. Carnevale's practice exercises contain flaws and typos and obscure language not age-appropriate for most 9th and 10th grade students. Word groupings ensure that a good number within each lesson are synonymous or what's worse, nearly so, making it difficult for students to keep words and their definitions distinct. It is also difficult to quiz students on these words because they are so closely related in meaning. Our school will not be using this text again."
1,Would be nice if it worked right,"We got 2 of these both with the same problem, the metal turning table would rub up against the heating element and arc, it's to bad cause it would of been nice to have."
2,"The title says it all, I should have known.",The book is probably of some use for somebody who is totally outside the design field in that it is basically a glossary of terms. For anybody other than that it's pretty much useless.
1,Don't be fooled!!,"Don't be fooled by the product description. This case is not Metal, nor is it even Stainless Steel. I even held a magnet up to the case and it did not attract. It has a 'metallic sheen' to it, but that's about it. The description is very misleading and false.My case came boogered up along the edge - sort of that melted plastic look you'd get if you dropped superglue on something plastic. It did not appear to come to me as a new product.Other reviews also indicate there is some sort of rubberized grip around the edge. Again, mine has no rubber of any kind on it.I'll use it for awhile, but it is not what I expected and I would not order it again. Buyer Beware!"
1,bring back bedtime bubba!!!,"This toy is fun for about 5 minutes. Bubba keeps repeating the same few phrases over & over. The bed time Bubba which I can no longer find, was totally awesome! He said so many things and his little flashlight really worked. I bought so many of them for my nieces & nephews. Now that I have a son I would love to get him one, but naturally because something is great they stopped making it.Do yourself a favor and save your money as this Bubba is totally not worth it."
2,SHOULD BE BETTER,"THE GOOD THING IS THAT IT FITS, OTHER THEN THAT T IS STIFF AND UNCOMFORTABLE. NOT HOW THEY USED TO MAKE EM."
1,cost of printer ink,"The printer ink wells do not last satisfactorly, and the cost for new inksis much too high. I would not recommend this printer because of the ink costs. Operation of printer is good. Relacement inks were difficult tofind."
5,"Great Printer, Copier, Scanner","I love it! Super easy to set up (Win XP Prof) I have tried the scanner and the Optical Character Recognition capability. The scanned document I did was much better than the original - very sharp. The OCR did a good job of scanning a text document into a new word document. I have not tried it with tables, etc. It is user friendly (only had to get the book out once, so far) and it is fast and quiet. I have not used the photo printing yet, but expect it to be just as good as the other functions. You won't be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"Unreasonable ink consumption, regular messages of ink needs which prevent use until changes are made, and 3 minutes of settings required to make a copy of an 8 1/2 x 11 original onto plain paper make this an unacceptable product in my opinion. It produces an excellent photo, interestingly better from computer hard drive than directly from chip using extra cost XD to CF adapter. Will not function if one of the 2 black cartridges are low. I use another printer for routine printing from computer, and regret getting rid of my old printer which had copying capability when I purchased the MP500. Cannot recommend for anything except photos. Would not purchase again."
5,The best printer I've ever purchased,I use both HP and Canon printers. I used to own only Epson printers but ran into issues with them. I use an HP printer for basic word documents (cheaper on ink) and the Canon MP500 for photos.I've never owned a consumer-based printer that prints photos as clear as this printer. It's awesome. I purchased the printer last summer and I haven't bought cartridges yet. I'm anticipating that they will be somewhat pricey.I also have a Canon SD20 digital camera that works seamlessly with the USB port on the front of the printer.Just remember that you will need a USB cable as today's printers do not include one.
5,Perfect Multi-Function Printer at a Good Price,"I finally had to dump my Epson because it was slow and the print quality varied from ok to lousy. I went through many ink cartridges and still couldn't get it to work with my Mac. So I read a few reviews on the Canon Pixma and ordered it a few months ago. What a difference! The print output is smooth, fast and crisp. I never have a bad print and it tells me when to change inks anyway. It's so quiet I forget it's printing. The scanner is fine and the copy function great. In all, it is well made and I wish I had made the switch a year ago. Finally, it's very reasonable for all the features you get."
4,Very nice all in one BUT,"This is a very nice all in one scan/print/copy no fax machine. However be prepared to shell out some bucks for the biggest of the 5 cartridges, the PGI-5. I am going thru about 1 every 3 weeks at a cost of about 15 bucks. There is no compatible as of yet. I went thru Office Depot where I paid $15 per but got free shipping on orders of $50 or more. I might have to bring back my Epson for my black ink print jobs. The other four cartridges are wearing very well. If it wasn't for the PGI-5 I would have given this machine 5 stars."
5,All-In-One's Make life Easy,"This Printer is easy to use, easy to understand. Scans Quickly, It print fast, and it is sturdy. Just remember that it is not a printer for tight spaces.Over all, we Love it."
3,I thought I bought a good printer?,"I loved this printer and then after five months I received an error code and my printer stopped working. I looked in vain and tried to find a source of the error code and finally called Canon. The rep had me turn the machine off and back on, which I of course already tried. He then told me there was nothing more he could do for me and I would have to take it in for service or they could send me a refurbished unit?? Luckily it is still under warranty and I'm just a half hour from the nearest service center. I think there may be some internal problems with this printer if after just five months it already starts shooting out error codes before I even had to change the ink the first time. I would buy with caution because the images and printing are nice when the printer actually works."
4,"Old, but worth reading","This book is the first biography of J S Bach and is well worth the time of anyone interested in this great composer. It is most interesting to see what Bach's first biographer said about him.Later scholars have shown that some of what Forkel has written is not completely accurate, but it is still well worth your time.And you can't beat the price.It would be greatly enhanced with a table of contents."
5,"Gertrude is Gertrude is Gertrude, Alice is Alice is...","Wow, it's been 20 years since Ms. Souhami wrote this book and fortunately it is again in print with this edition which also includes a new introduction by her. The introduction itself is amazing and worth buying another copy of the book even if you already have one. (You can give your other copy to a friend!)This is the best dual-bio of these two ladies (and I've read it both in German and English.) The book makes both of them very real, moving them beyond the literary/lesbian icons that they've become in the last 60+ years. Read this in conjunction with James Mellow's CHARMED CIRCLE (you can still find it online through used book dealers or in many 2nd hand bookstores.) and you'll be hooked both on Gertrude and Alice and the artistic era between the two World Wars!"
5,So much fun!,"I loved this movie years ago, enough to look it up on Amazon and buy it. I've played it for my jaded and ""apathetic"" middle school students and they love it as well.This movie is a lovely little story with some humor and charm. It doesn't try to be edgy or dramatic. That's what makes it so rare and refreshing."
4,Haynes Repair Manual,Like all Haynes manuals it is easy to follow the instructions and find the information I am looking for. I only find the manufacturer shop manuals to be more comprehensive but not always as easy to use.
3,Disatisfied,I tried to cancel this order hours after I placed it. The company I dealt with did not get back to me for three days after I cancelled and said they were too busy to cancel and shipped product anyway. I felt that they just didn't want to cancel order to make there money. I will probably not use amazon again. I gave the prodcut a 3 but the company and amazon a Minus Five Star!
3,Overpriced,The cleaner is fine - but (at the time of this review) the single unit purchase price is much higher than if you purchased it from the iRobot site (where you can buy it in multi-unit packs). I'm sure this price reflects that you're purchasing cleaner from a specialty store (thus far I've seen it sold from The Sharper Image as well as a music store - not Amazon directly).
1,irobot is not selling this product anymore,"I recently purchased the scooba and they are NOT using the clorox solution, but have a different product. They also said not to use any bleach products as it will eat at the rubber parts. check their website for more details on their cleaning solution. Also, it is the cheapest way to buy it, as far as I have been able to find out."
5,delicate and charming,"the book is very well illustrated. it tells a lovely tale of the right to make mistakes, and the way to mend them - all in good humor and fine understanding of a child's worry confronting mistakes! loved it! got it!"
4,Erotic Literature at it's best...even contains a warning!,"I enjoyed this book very much because it was exactly what it claimed to be. Anyone who picks up this book should read the warning (which is very large) on the back cover. It says it is ""Erotic Literature and may not be suited for that reader."" This book is not for everyone, but it's fun if you are passionately openminded. I totally got it and it was as I expected. It was hot, paranormal to the core and sexy in the most unashamed, unabashed and sexually liberal way possible. If the reader cannot handle that type of imagry and sexual experimentation then it's not for that person. I for one liked it very much and so did my husband who read it with me."
1,Wolf Tales 1,"I never received the book. I ordered ""Enchantress Mine' at the same time and I received it but did not receive Wolf Tales I. so I can not review something I have not received."
1,0 stars,"I like erotica -- Emma Holly ROCKS -- this one is just too, too shallow. The characters are all way too flat -- hard to empathize with any of them, so not hot at all...Bummer, seemed so promising from other reviews..."
1,not good...keep it moving,the story is quick to start but overall the love story is lame at best. i dont like the characters which is important dont ya think? alexandria just seemed like a classic girl that has been done wrong and is desperate. the guy/ wolf is lame....then the author adds anton and hes gay??? no hes not gay???? wait he might be gay??? make a decision. then alexandria discovers what she really is and now shes doing everybody. the story jumps around the plot is soooooo bad. how people rated this book so high ill never understand i had to force myself to finish. dont waste your money. KEEP IT MOVING
1,WHY IS THIS TEXT SO WIDELY USED?,"I had to use this poorly written, overpriced book for my course at Cal State L.A. There are insufficient examples, some of which are confusing, and the binding seems to have been deliberately designed to fall apart after a few months (to limit the used market?). The problems sets are sorely lacking in imagination and, as others have noted, poorly worded. I would recommend the Schaum's outline in theoretical mechanics by Murray Spiegel. It is inexpensive and contains a wealth of good examples. When you finally get to sell back Marion at the end of the course , you will still have a good reference on intermediate mechanics and won't feel as bad about the money you lost on M&T."
4,A Good Intro to Classical Concepts,"Although it is not as detailed and thorough as Goldstein, this text is a very good intro to classical concepts. With a good instructor, much can be learned from it. The text is a good reference source as well."
1,Poorly constructed book.,"I am on the third copy of this book and, like the previous two, whole sections have become unattached.Never have I had a hardcover book fall apart on me before.Either the binding methodology is faulty or the binding is being done improperly.I feel certain that others are having the same problem.The whole printing should be recalled."
2,Not Like My Casablanca,"I bought my 1st two fans- this one and a Casablanca. The Casablanca is impressive- it's silent- even on really fast speeds, and doesn't wobble or tilt at all. Installation with the casablanca was a breeze. This hunter was a headache for him to install (something to consider if you pay your handyman by the hour!) and the quality just isn't the same. It tilts- although just slightly, and shakes a little. It's enough that I'm slightly concerned with it's position above my bed. Most annoyingly, I can't turn the fan off or on without some real effort. The cord is 'dispensed' through a hole that's slightly off-center so I can't pull straight down. I have to pull at an angle and in order to do that, I have to stand on my bed. Even then it's not easy. I had thought hunter was the name to get- maybe others are better??"
3,The story repeats itself a bit,"I have been reading Danielle Steel's books for over 15 years now. Sometimes they do get a bit ""all the same"" with most of the characters being important, successful, beautiful people who live in ""stately homes"" and wear ""important jewels and furs"". Sometimes I think the characters are more about what they have then who they are. Despite this, I always enjoy her books - they are easy to read, romantic and make you forget about everyday life for a couple of hours while engrossed in the book. Personally I think her earlier books are more enjoyable and get more involved in the characters than some of the later books she If you love Danielle Steel you'll like this one too. This is one of her later books and one that I enjoyed as the characters were more developed than some of her others. The story does seem to repeat the same things over and over which gets a little tiresome but all in all, not a bad book."
3,Not one of her best,"Although I have always admired Danielle's writing ability, I found this to be one of my least favorites. The story was good and admittedly tugs at your heartstrings from time to time, but it's a long time in getting you there. By the end of the book, I was so frustrated with the endless discriptions of the disfunctional characters that I was actually happy to see this one come to an end."
3,good read,"This was a good book, not one of her best, but good anyhow. True to form she is back to the old writing style unlike Five days in Paris. If you are a died in the wool fan you will like it"
5,College student's review,I enjoyed reading this book. I can see these three characters in real life. They all relate to my mother and two of her sisters. I was refreshing to see that someone elses life is as complecated and rewarding as mine.
4,Enough to keep me reading,"Connie Brisco's Sisters & Lovers was good enough to keep me reading, but it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be. All in all, Connie Brisco is a very good writer. Keep up the good work!"
3,"""It's O.K. I Guess""","Of the three sisters, ""Charmaine"" was my main interest. My heart went out for this sister because of the trials and tribulations that she had to endure. ""Clarence"" was too much drama for me, but he was hilarious about his clothes and all his ""let me explain"" or ""I can explain"" antics. ""Beverly"" worked my nerves with all her complaining and nic-picking. Helllooo, perfect men don't exist.""Evelyn"" is the perfect example of everything that looks good may not be good. To me, Ms. Briscoe focused too much on men being the ""center"" of these womens' lives. Beverly's sisters and her friends fixing her up on blind dates, as her 30th birthday approaches, they make it seem like she's and old maid because she doesn't have a man and kids. You don't need a man and kids to be a woman...you're all that regardless."
2,A TRUE WASTE OF GOOD PAPER!!!,"I was very excited by the title, but after reading about four chapters, I had already knew this book would drag on!!! This book had nothing to do with sisterhood or lovers, instead it was about a constant relationship of 3 bickering sisters who could never get it right. A good book usually takes 1 to 2 days to read, this one was soo slow and boring, it took a whole month! I do not recommend sisters and lovers to anyone under the age of 55! (meaning=boooring!!) A bit of advice for connie, Don't quit your day job!!"
5,Required Gish Viewing,"This and Broken Blossoms are the defining moments in Lillian Gish's career. Watch and you'll be hooked. I pretty much bestow all the same accolades as everybody else about this film. Griffith was not quite a master of slapstick, but the moments here are not much different from other comedies at the time. The key of course is Gish's mesmerizing performance and a simple plot (this is 1920 of course). What a treat it is to own this movie and other silents on DVD. The picture quality is virtually perfect. The music score is a recording of an original score. It's scratchy but authentic. My only gripe with this edition is the title cards. The letters look like they came from the Sunday comics. One small quibble in an otherwise remarkable DVD."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this case to use when I work out. The controls are hard to access through the screen and it is difficult to get the zen micro into the case. It is also extremely difficult to get the case on to the arm-band attachment. Once you've accomplished that task, and eventually manage to fasten it around your arm, you will discover that it is extremely unstable and the micro bounces up and down alarmingly, looking like its about to fall off. It is secured on your arm only by velcro. The case is not particularly sturdy, and does not appear to be effective in protecting the zen micro from damage if you drop it. All in all, an extremely disappointing buy."
3,Not so good.,"I've read several reviews before buying this CD, but honestly I didn't like it, even when I do love Italian music. I thought that ""lounge"" in the title meant lounge music, not necessarily in this case. Some of the songs have too fast a beat for lounge music."
5,My children love it!,I bought this for my 14-year-old daughter who is in love with horses. My 2-year-old son has now taken ownership and takes it everywhere. It seems durable and they love it.
5,Small book with a powerful message,"Sage and smudging is much more than just burning some leaves in a dish. Silver Wolf explains the plant, its uses, the ceremonies, and the reverence it and Mother Earth should be given. This tiny book is worth twice the money in my opinion."
1,Buyer Beware,"I ordered this product to remove a locking lug nut for which the key had become stripped. When I received the product, I discovered that it was for an impact wrench, something that was not pointed out in the advertising copy. I don't have an impact wrench, so I borrowed one from a friend. Instead of removing the lug nut, it broke the lug off. I would not recommend this product."
4,It did the job a tire shop wouldn't/couldn't do.,"I bought a project car that had lock lugs on the wheels, but no key. I bought these based on what I read online and sure enough. It worked exactly how it was supposed to. I was finally able to put my new calipers and wheels on after being turned away from three local tire shops. The only complaint is it can be very difficult to remove from each lock lug afterwards. If you do not have a bench vise. You're gonna have a bad time."
2,every thing will fall out,I thought I would love this wallet; it has so much room for a small/mid size wallet. the two flap will hold credit cards but if you open it up the flap are now upside down and stuff will fall out. It will hold a iphone 4. It will hold a lot of stuff. another problem I had was trying to find my stuff. don't like it. brought me another wallet instead.
1,Wallet purse,"I hated this because the credit cards fall out of the wallet organizer. Unfortunately, I removed the double-flap because I didn't want that and now I can't return it."
1,Entertaining but ...,"was not very useful. The stories are somewhat entertaining, but the book does not provide good recipes.There were some mis-translated words, such as ""Baechu"", which the author called leek (Baechu is napa cabbage).I also tried out some of the recipes such as soon dubu and the proportion of the ingredients were way off."
3,Durable,"It is very durable and is functional for our growing big dog. Our dog is a puppy and she uses lowest setting at 11 weeks...I would have givin this a five star if the screw color matched the frame and not the bowls...makes it less attractive,thats my wife talking. Bowls seem to stay in place as the beast eats...so I think we got the pick of the litter. For the price u cannot go wrong...30$....no brainer."
5,Great bowl riser.,"Our six year old German shepherd mix got this meal station for Christmas. Before he was having trouble bending all the way down to the floor to eat and drink, and in the process he would push the bowls all over the kitchen. This solves that problem! It took him a few days to get used to eating from it, but we are sure he likes it!The collapsible legs are sturdy and adjustable. The bowls are nice stainless steel. Definitely recommended!"
4,Consise views of a complicated city,"Renowned French historian Allister Horne has selected a number of important eras to describe the evolution of Paris This approach makes his work both informative and entertaining By not delving into every trend or historical undercurrent in the deep and complicated history of this city, the materiel presented is highly accessible. Completing this book should whet one's appetite to know more about this city and it's people"
1,Don't know much about (medieval) history,"Let me start by saying that I gave up on this book midway through the third chapter. I just could no longer stand the factual errors! It's clear that Horne loves Paris, but he apparently doesn't feel quite so deeply about the study of history. Why write about a period without at least finding out the basic facts? Is it such an obscure fact that Jerusalem was in CHRISTIAN hands during the Second Crusade (giving the French king no reason to besiege it, as Horne claims he did), or that the defeat at Courtrai was at the hands of Flemings, NOT Edward I of England? The average reader might not know his or her history, but an historian certainly should.Another reviewer pointed out that the facts are more reliable with regards to the modern period, so there may be some use for this book. But with regard to its (possibly too ambitious) scope, I can't forgive the errors on the medieval period.Let's hope that facts will be checked and maps added for future printings."
1,This vacuum will break before one year is up.,"The wand ends are made from plastic that will break. If they had made them from metal, there would be no problem.We have tried to get a replacement wand to no avail.Alas, our one year warranty already ended. The brush head unit doesn't clean very close to the edge.The tool storage isn't very good either. It's like a puzzle trying to get them to fit back in correctly.It does have good suction though. We like the HEPA filtration too."
2,can't find parts,"i own this vacuum, the vacuum it's self is not bad, but you can not find anybody that will service them or can get any parts. i also have fantom fury same thing ,no one want's to even talk about them. in the begining i thought this was a great vacuum, so i bought my daughter one . both power nozzles broke,and searched everywhere and can't find one. can someone hepl me?"
1,Useless,"Like others who have reviewed this item, I am VERY disappointed with it. Fantom appears to have gone out of business, so don't expect any replacement parts/repairs to be available on this item. The collar that connects the metal wand to the metal powerhead is made of: plastic...which breaks quite easily. Now I'm driving out of state to buy the LAST one available at that repair shop.It does clean OK..but the reliability is so bad, it doesn't matter."
5,Awesome book!!!,A highly entertaining collection of stories involving the ancient world. You will read about societies from Libya to India and everything in between. This is also easy reading and the translation is great. You will simply be shocked at the way the world was back then and some of the religious rituals that people used to have.
5,Computer tips and tricks for the newbie,"Leo Laporte, host of TechTV's The Screen Savers and Tech Live, writes his first book for new computer users. There are 365 tips and tricks, one for each day of the year, plus Leo's wit and wisdom at the beginning of each month. There's something for everyone in this book."
5,Make It A Tradition,"One year down, hopefully many more to come. I keep mine next to my laptop and check out a new tip whenever I have a spare moment. In a Windows-dominated universe, Leo's book (like his TV show) is operating-system agnostic. Even if you're devoted to a particular OS, Leo's tips about the others will broaden your horizons as to their capabilities. I bought a copy for my Dad and made him swear to read it daily (much of it will be over his head, but, like vitamins, it will be good for his long-term health). Thanks, Leo, for a useful and entertaining tool."
2,Wasted Time,"Malone's last album ""Darkest Part of The Night"" was so good I guess I was expecting something more than this one delivers. I found the songs on this CD to be tedious and boring for the most part. Bob sounded like he got stuck in the same old groove and couldn't get out. Certainly not up to a standard he set with even some of his earlier work, like the ""Bob Malone"" tracks. If you're a big Malone fan give it a shot, maybe you will hear something I didn't."
4,Mistys pain overcomes her beauty,"Misty Mundae has never looked better than in this movie and it may be her best effort so far as an actress.However the director chose to make this a much more cynical version than the original.I do not like seeing our girl beaten up, raped, and humiliated as the girl in the original version never had to go through this .(Chantal is a redo of a movie from the 60's).The result was a complete collapse of Mistys resolve and she went into a crying fit that lasted over 4 hours.She brought back all the bad menories of her career, or should I say the the director brought back all the bad memories .The ending is disgusting for such a talented performer to have to under go.What was Marsiglia thinking?As a result Misty never made another movie under the name of Misty Mundae and only one or two under the name of Erin Brown."
5,STRATA!!!!!!,"Piece by Piece & Lyric by Lyric this Cd will blow you away!! Promise. My very first concert i saw Strata preform and they blew the crowd away with their lyrics and individual sound they have going for them. It was great. I will never forget it! Today i bought their Cd and as i was listening to their songs i was like damn these guys have real talent, i never doubted for a secound after i saw them that night that they werent going somewhere, cause i really believe they're gonna be big! They really have what it takes, Pure Talent! I wish them the best of luck! xoxo Bonnie*Gotta listen: The Panic & Today!!!!!!!"
5,Must listen,"Check out Strata's debut CD ""Same"". They have spent some time on the road in the past, touring, before releasing their CD. They have put much energy into their shows and their CD. This album will win you over with its hard rock rhythms and it's alluring lyrics. This CD will not disappoint."
5,Great Stuff!,"Strata is an amazing band. I saw them for the first time when they were on tour with Finger Eleven, Smile Empty Soul and Trapt when they played in Portland, ME. From their very first song you could tell they were exactly what any true music lover is looking for. They are very original and talented and it shows in this cd. It is definately a must own for anyone with common sense!"
4,The lead singer looks like Chino Moreno,"I saw Strata live march 26 2004 when they opened up for Trapt on the Snowcore tour, i thought they great. The lead singer looks Chino Moreno from Deftones because i think the strata singer is latino too and he has the same bulky build as Chino."
3,"Hey Craig, too busy to learn the pronounciation?","Great CD musically. And by great I mean some of the best new-age spiritual music out there, especially the Buddham Sharanam track and Om Tara.However, the pronounciation of mantras is wrong. Especially Om Tara, which should actually be Om Tare.Even other pronounciations are not faultless.I just don't get it. The guy spends so much time in India; he spent so much time on this music, but then he blows it due to the pronounciations which he could've learnt in an hour.Strange.So, I have to give it 3 stars:5 for music and 1 for mantras."
5,SI TIENES MAS DE 25 A`OS,"Y NO HAY UN HOMBRE EN TU VIDA...ES PORQUE NO QUIERES!Porque con los consejos de este maravilloso manual, no tienes que ser Britney Spears para que te rodeen los galanes !"
4,Great Movie,We really enjoyed this movie. There are some great musical numbers and dance routines. I recommend it highly.
2,Not what I was hoping for...,Not sure why troupes like this don't just release videos of their shows. This is an odd movie of the life of a man from embryo to old man illustrated in some of the Cirque du Soleil dance and acrobatic (and aquatic) routines. It was neat and had some decent 3d shots - but overall it got boring. I'd prefer to see one of their shows. If I had it to do over I wouldn't have bought this DVD.
1,Boring,The seller was great video arrived earlier than the expected date. but the movie is BORING. I bought the movie to check out my TV's 3D capabilities the 3D in the movie was OK but the movie its self was not good.
1,This 3D bluray is defective.,"I purchased this from amazon and it would not play on both a sony and samsung 3d bluray player. It would either eject and say disc error or load forever, or occasionally make it to the menu, but the movie would only play for a few seconds then lock up. Even though I've never had a bad dvd or bluray before I thought that particular disc must of been bad. I sent it back to amazon and they sent me another brand new one. Guess what? Same exact problem.Sony also makes the swimsuit sports illustrated 3d bluray and it plays fine along with all my other 3D and 2D blurays and dvds.The few seconds I saw of the film between it locking up did show great 3D and was really pretty to look at, I wish I could watch the whole thing."
3,"Very colorfull film, but not up to the expectation.","The very successfull Cirque Du Soleil decided to lately present its talent on a short film rather than their traditional public show. It was nice watching it on film, however I have the following remarks:Pros: Very colorfull, talented, nice sountrack, and entertaining.Cons: Very short (30-45 mins), no story, and lacks singing. I guess it would have been much nicer if it was a musical, such as Moulin Rouge. It could have been a romantic story with some singing and lots of their talented acrobatic shows."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this boring, highly abstract, rather pointless movie. No coherent monologue, dialog, story line. Turned it off after 20 minutes."
3,was ok,The idea of this movie was cute and it has a few classic cirque moments but it really is geared for younger viewers and was rather simple for a cirque du soleil film . Its ok if you rent it for your kids but i wouldnt purchase this after renting it. Didnt wow me at all.
4,Not bad,This is my first ever Cirque show and so am very impressed at who they are and what they do. Thouroughly impressed with the music in 7.1 surround.3D is very good and its more depth than pop out....which itself is very good and you almost feel like hovering over the pond in one of the scenes...they should have added more camera movement to draw you more into the show.Somehow i felt the whole show is cloudy and not sharp...but this is definitely worth the less than $15 price tag.
1,The worst book ever!!!!,"This book is horrible. First, the information is not correct. The terminology and geography are totally wrong. Second, it is filled with personal comments favoring one religion and rejecting all the others. He is bias. It is not worth the time and money."
4,Bringing back Native American Wisdom,"This book, along with the stones provided, is short but has the most of the essential elements to understand the wisdom of the Native American beliefs. I wish that it had more of the detail and history, which I feel is so rich and important. Overall, it is a nice place to start in understanding the belief system that has been a major influence for many people."
5,High Praise...,"""I heart-fully enjoyed an excellent book about the authors experience spending the day in the forest. I could feel the wholesome adventure and spiritual richness come through."" -Ed McConnell...More reviews within the following non-profit web site...http://www.concentric.net/~Edmc/frj.html"
3,NOT FOR EVERYONE,"I enjoyed the read. I enjoyed it much more after I decided not to project my own expierences and attitudes (I have spent most of my life living in the Ozarks), onto the authors work. There were parts of the book which were truely good. Other parts made me worry. Setting in a tree during a storm is not my cup of tea, but hey, if it rang Carey's bell....who am I to throw rocks. All in all, I would recommend the read, it was interesting and it is always good to look inside another persons world. I do admire the author's sticktoitness. So many of the ""back-to-the-land-folks"" who come there depart so quickly."
1,bulbs,these were the wrong bulbs. Did not fit my lantern. Did not know how to return them so I just threw them away. Very disappointed.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I live in the desert and the lack of humidity causes me to get shocked every time I get out of my car. I was hoping that some moisture in the car might alleviate this, so I bought this personal humidifier. It worked fine for about 5 minutes, then died. Fortunately the seller was very accommodating and refunded my money."
2,can you say PBS or library level,Ok it says it shows all this stuff on multiple DVD's but this is a rather poor documentary version. Almost grainy video. There's a single DVD version that's gotta be better than this.
4,Historical Mystery,"This is a well-researched book that covers a peripheral story to the Montana Vigilante hangings. I enjoyed the book. For people looking for interesting factual historical intrigue, this is a must-have title."
3,It works,"It's easy to agree with most of the positive and negative reviews. Yes, it is replete with coincidences and cliches, but the pacing allows us to quickly get over our eye-rolls."
5,Very solidly written and well told story,"I'm not going to rehash the plot here but only say that Stephen Horn is a very good writer of legal thrillers with this particular novel being a fine example of his skills. He draws you in with a fascinating look at a down and out lawyer who finds a better part of himself through the things that happen in this book. Ultimately, this is a novel about redemption and written in a way that makes it's points without appearing to lecture or moralize. It's just a good novel. Period.I had the pleasure of attending a seminar where Stephen appeared and was highly impressed by his wisdom, communication skills and his interesting ideas about writing and legal thrillers."
5,What a tangled web he weaves!!,"""Law of Gravity"" is a definite 5-star mystery novel. Horn pulls you deeper and deeper into his tangled web of politics, murder and cover ups. You may think you have it figured out, but don't be fooled! As soon as you get comfortable with the story, another surprise is in store! What a fun read!! I couldn't put it down!"
4,As Advertised but may not be for children,I bought this for use with my young kids. It is made out of a hard (brittle) plastic so I worry that they may pull it away from the wall and it will shatter in to sharp plastic shards. Otherwise it is as advertised and is easy to install.
4,Lady of Court Square,"After years of extensive research, Ms. O'Riley has completed a book that honors our grandmother. The book encourages the reader to follow her passion, relying upon principles of integrity, determination, and self realization. It is an easy, inspirational read, and captures the essence of this very special lady."
2,Pay Attention to What The Kids Are Watching??,"My grandson, age 2 1/2, loved the Brave Little Toaster Goes to the City; however, after watching the BLT Goes to Mars, he started this thing, ""I hate God.."" He just kept saying it from time to time and we realized that he associated the 'refrigerator' or Supreme Commander in this movie with God, as his conception of going up to Mars was like going up to Heaven where he, through this movie, was introduced to 'God'.... or so he thought, and he was upset by the refrigerator character. It's just good to try and find out where the kids 'thoughts' are..."
5,Best Mathematics Handbook,"This work is, by far, the best mathematics handbook I've purchased. It is extremely well organized and well-written. The typeography is very clear. In the 1153 pages there are 745 figures and 142 tables. All areas of mathematics are covered in detail: arithmetic, functions, geometry, linear algebra, algebra and discrete mathematics, differentiation, infinite series, integral calculus, differential equations, calculus of variations, linear integral equations, functional analysis, vector analysis and vector fields, function theory, integral transformations, probability theory and mathematical statistics, dynamical systems and chaos, optimization, numerical analysis, computer algebra systems, and tables. A detailed bibliography and index are provided. Recommended for all mathematicians, scientists, and engineers!"
4,Excellent reference book,I highly recommend the Handbook of Mathematics. It is an excellent resource for every engineering student and professional engineer.
2,Cute but I don't know effect on back,"I have a very bad lumbar region plus sciatica. I just cannot know whether this helps per se as opposed to using TENs and opiates. It feels like a lumpy, slim pillow."
5,Worth trying a new anti-virus,"I have Windows XP which came with McAfee. I used both Norton and McAfee but lately McAfee's updates seem to have giving other users a lot of trouble. Rather than updating the anti-virus definitions, etc., I decided to try Zone Alarm where many users seem to like it.I must say that from the moment I installed it the only problem I ran was that you have to completely unistall your current antivirus, firewall, etc. if ZoneAlarm is to work. To date the software has worked beautifully. Actually, I believe that my computer runs smoother and slightly faster. I definately would upgrade or buy this product again. Check some of the sellers for the bargain prices. I bought mine for 19.99, which is a big savings from the ZoneAlarm website. It is worth every penny."
4,Security Suite,"This suite is very effective in all aspects of its applications. If I have any negatives, it's because it is so effective that it keeps popping up with alerts. Somewhat annoying especially when it repeats the same alert several times during the day."
1,Forget about upgrading from an earlier version. It doesn't work!,"Installation is a PAIN! I had been using an earlier version and needed to renew. I purchased this product in hopes of upgrading and not losing all my settings. Well, that did not work. I tried installing it many times but never got past the first window. I went online for support and found that others had been having the same problem and the only fix was to uninstall my old version and do a ""clean install"". That was my last resort but I had no other choice except to go out and buy another product. That's what I did and then it installed perfectly but I'm back to the little window popping up every few minutes telling me ""so and so"" is trying to access my computer, etc. So if you have hopes of upgrading and keeping your old settings, forget it."
1,Ugghh - Horrible....,"Doesn't hold a candle to PC-Cillin. They've slashed costs, and still not worth a cent. Its a resource hog and I've always had problems with installations (I'm an IT guy). Trend Micro is the way to go, followed by Symantec in a distant second. Stay away from Avanquest and McAfee."
5,Good druma at a good price,"Buying a drum cartridge you always wonder if the quality is o.k. If at the supplier the shelf life has or has not deteriorated the drum etc. etc.In this case, I can say that this drum is of good quality. I changed the drum and immediately noticed the difference. Very good quality. I would recommend to buy this Cartridge."
1,Cheaply made,"This was the cheapest made shower curtain I've ever bought. It was flimsy and even though there were magnets at the bottom they were of no use. Plus while putting the hooks in , it ripped."
2,Why bother?,"This collections gives you 7 of the 8 tracks from the 1985 Power Station album - at that rate, just buy that album. Moreover, it only features one track from the much better 1996 Power Station album 'Living in Fear'.I'd only recommend getting this if you are really keen on getting the other tracks not found on either album.But basically you might as well get the first album to get most the songs found here and get Living in Fear to get all the ones missing from here."
1,"I agree with the others, save your money","Seeing as I normally ignore reviews and form my own opnion, I got burned bad here buying this DVD. Its watchable, but nothing special. The vaunted IMAX pictures really look nothing different than what we've seen before, and in fact spends more time above the surface or just in the debris field than actually pictures of the ship. If there was any footage of inside the ship, I must have blinked and missed it.About the only new thing I observed from this was how much a ghoul Ralph White is, and his comments as he wants to pillage the ship I'm amazed they didnt edit out.Its almost worth buying this DVD to hear his Russian divemate chide him for wanting to open lugguage on the ocean floor ""But zat does not belong to you!"""
2,"Not Enough Story, Not Enough Screen","'Titanica' documents the efforts to film and salvage some of the remains from the Titanic wreckage. How the scientists are able to take themselves to the ship in and of itself is an interesting story, but too much time is spent on that aspect. Tension develops as scientists argue among themselves over what artifacts should and shouldn't be brought back to the surface. Unfortunately, that scene is about as exciting as it gets.The history of the ship and its fateful voyage is adequately covered, but I would have enjoyed hearing more information from the two survivors who were interviewed. Like all the IMAX DVDs, 'Titanica' ultimately suffers from being forced onto a small screen. The information presented is somewhat useful and moderately interesting, but the small format of a television screen (no matter how large your home entertainment center stretches) just can't inspire the awe that viewers experience in an IMAX theatre."
5,Real footage of the ship!,"My students read about the Titanic disaster. After our study, we watch this dvd. They love it! It's fun to hear the real commentary of the scientists researching and finding the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean. The students are always sitting on the edge of their seats with their mouths open!"
3,"Good price, kind of bulky.","They weigh more than I expected, however a good price. Might be worth spending $20 more for something friendlier to wear in the woods for several hours."
4,Safety on a Budget!,These chaps adjust to fit just about any size and they are long enough to cover to your shoes. I am 6' and 225 lbs and I think I am about halfway in the middle in terms of the range that these will adjust. The nylon padding appears that it will jam a chainsaw on contact. I'll be sure to update this review if I ever find out for sure. :)
1,This item sucks! I got only part of it!,I can't believe that they would send me only PART of the mobile. There's nothing but the cloth! Nothing to hang these items on! THIS is a mobile? I'm disgusted with Amazon.
2,Mobile Appeared Used,"I received the mobile and it looked used. The white plastic was all scratched up and dirty. I tried to clean it up, but nothing worked. We were disappointed and decided not to put it in the baby's room."
2,"italianized, lacks character","singer has untransparent voice, sounds muffled and obscure, uses the vibrato far too often.compositions jettison modal character of traditional bulgarian music, making melody sound disconnected from tonal center of gravity.in short, little or no ""bulgarian"" flavor-except when the heavenly choir makes an appearance."
3,cute but...,"well two things, first these shoes are BIG! I read all the revews andordered them half a size small, and they were still way too big. Second Ididn't realize from the ad in Cosmo that the shoes were mesh(oversight on my part) so you can't wear socks with them to helpwith the size. plus they seem to make my feet very warm, i may just be crazy, i dunno.now a year and a half later and they are still ""new"" never been out of the house. my roomate wears the same size shoe as me, (a ten)and the shoes are a nine and a half and she says she is ""swimming in them"" so i guess i'm not the only crazy one;D"
1,BAD TOY - HARD ASSEMBLY - NO VEHICLES INCLUDED - NOT TODDLER FRIENDLY,All the other reviews are right. It took 2 guys a couple hours to build this toy. It didn't come with ANY vehicles - not a single airplane. And when my 4 year old plays with it it falls apart. This leads to many tears and much disappointment. It's a horrible toy. Do not buy it. This is the first review I have ever written and I am writing it to hopefully save some mom from making the mistake I made.
5,Excellent for stereo output of keyboard into mixer/recorder.,This is an excellent cable. I use it to connect the stereo headphone out of my Kurzweil PC361 keyboard to two tracks on a Zoom R16 mixer/recorder. The signal is excellent and just as good as connecting the mono R/L outs on the keyboard with two cords to the mixer/recorder. I also plan to use it for the stereo out on my electric guitar. The tips make a nice solid connection into the keyboard and mixer/recorder jacks without being hard to remove.
4,Great Tub,"Practical and not bad looking for the laundry room. I thought the faucet came with it, that was my only disappointment."
3,Disappointed,"I looked all through the chapters on the comedies, particularly _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, and could find no reference to his famous ""Green World."" There were casual allusions to a ""wood-world,"" but I knew that wasn't it. I felt misled. SO, if you're looking for the source of his Green World idea, this is not the book."
2,The price is for the worth,"This is a quality product FOR THE PRICE. but as far as shelf, life and actual quality you would want in a battery. Look elsewhere"
5,True meaning of Christmas...,Great gift for my two grand daughters. They love playing nativity throughout the year. Hands on story of Jesus birth.
3,cute nativity set,I put this under my tree as a nativity set my daughter could play with. Turned out was great photo props.
3,Good Vacuum but Lousy reconditioning,"The vacuum runs great but this company does a terrible job at reconditioning their products. Mine came with dust all over it and a musty smell. Also, expect scratches that are not repaired. Ive bought plenty of reconditioned merchandise and have never seen such lack of detail by a company."
1,"Great Out the Gate, But Then . . .","I purchased this vacuum in Aug 01, and loved it to pieces. It pulled up so much ""stuff"" from our carpets each time I vacuumed, that I began to vacuum almost daily (the hubby was loving that, as we have four boys under 10). I raved about this vacuum until just this week - the motor is on it's final gasp. Just like that, it's a gonner, unresponsive to all maintenance and troubleshooting attempts, and now out of warranty. Tried to contact customer service and plead my case, but they're ""OUT OF BUSINESS, SORRY FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE"". Guess I know what I'll be getting for my upcoming birthday . . ."
5,Santana at his best,"Fantastic live show. Music is perfect. He does great bringing in all the vocal talent to go with his ""one of the best"" lead guitar playing. A must have for the older crowd who has know Santana since the 70's and great for 'kids' who like the contemporary singers he has chosen as partners."
2,Superbad,The Music track on the concert is the worst I have ever heard. The DVD does have 4 videos that are great. Not worth the money or the time to watch it. I am surprised the artist let this be released?
5,Carlos....music from God through Carlos Santana to our ears!,Outstanding ...beyond words....works magic with his guest performers...now you know why the Grammy's are all on his shelf!!
4,Good introduction for BCB 3,"This book was a very good introduction to the C++ Builder environment. It clearly explained the basic features of C++ Builder, and also had some information on the program's history. Not only was the information in this book helpful for learning C++ Builder 3, but most of the information I learned was also applicable to other Borland programming environments such as Delphi. The only part I didn't like about the book was that the first part was too much devoted to basic C++ programming, which I was already familiar with.I would recommend this book to anyone who is unfamiliar with Borland tools, or who has never used Delphi or C++ Builder. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone who is familiar with Delphi or VCL (the Visual Component Library). This book seems to be designed primarily for people who have never used the Delphi/C++ Builder environment."
3,"Very efficient, but looks like single use stuff","It really does what it says, your camera won't get wet with it, but the little hole for the viewfinder is just a whole in a single plastic sheet, nothing else! It gets destroyed very very easily, the only bad point I could find.I keep it only as a backup, I've bought a way thicker one for ""normal use"""
3,"Serves the purpose (I assume), so it's OK","Pros : Covers the camera.Cons : The material is very thin & may tear easily when used.Got it anyway, since it wasn't particularly expensive."
1,Save your money,"On occasion, when the ocean is stormy, I would use a one gallon freezer bag to keep the spray off my SLR. I don't know why I thought this would be better but it's much thinner plastic and, IMHO, not as good. Amazon was wonderful with an instant, no hassle refund!"
4,good protection,Used this during hurricane Sandy in driving rain(50 mph+ winds) with good results. Only problem was that it auto-focus is useless and manual focus is difficult if you use it over a lens hood.
4,Perfect for using your camera where it's wet!,"I was headed to Zambia, and based on research, knew that it was going to be VERY wet near the falls....so picked up some of these. Oh man am I glad I did. VERY wet? Might as well have been treading water. Before we hit the ""wet zone"", I slipped these over our cameras. It leaves the lens glass exposed, but gives PLENTY of room for you to get your hands around the camera through the sleeve. to manipulate the camera. I had to constantly wipe the lens itself (duh), but the camera stayed dry.Definitely recommended if you're headed to a wet environment."
3,The right sleeve for the situation.,"Great that there are 2 in a pack. This sleeve is a part of my accessories. Having been a Scout. I believe in ""Being Prepared"" ."
1,Great to use as a time out!,"The tin is nice. The picture on the front of the tin makes it look more up to date. The picture and sound are horrible. I am not one of these picky people who has to have the clearsest sound and volume, but this was BAD!! Lots of humans. Very dark in color. Very boring. I bought it at Sam's Club for 10 bucks and still feel like I was ripped. I decided to use it as punishment. It will make the perfect timeout. Don't waste your money on this. Skip it unless you want the tin. I will have to say it was packaged well inside too. I have never gotten DVDs with wood ""holders"". I don't know what to call them."
1,"Bland, through and through","I had heard a couple tracks from the Trio before, and fell in love with the song ""Radio"", so I went out on a limb, on a whim, finally, and picked up this album. I've listened to it twice now and I can't recall a single note. In fact, this album was one very long boring song. Everything sounded flat and the same. Zero dynamics. Zero thoughtful lyrics. Just one big zero. But I can't give this album a zero, because Amazon doesn't have that option.I'm willing to try another earlier album, when they presumably had more spunk and were willing to take chances, but there is NOTHING new or interesting in this album for me."
4,Every Band Evolves,"I've heard the full catalog of Alkaline Trio and every album offers somthing different. If they were to write and sing songs that sounded the same and constantly touched on the same topics then they would get flamed for that. Why is it people can't just let a band change over time instead of producing the same songs over and over again. If Weezer did that then noone would like any album after ""Pinkerton"" because it would get compared to every song as an abomination or combination of two gems from the original album. Say what you want but this is a good album. The songs are well done, well written and they even make an effort to touch on their orignal songs in tracks like ""Burn"" and ""Back to Hell"".Well thats my two cents. You can take it or leave it; but I assure you, if they gave you exactly what you wanted then you would have the same degree of disappointment for giving you what you expected...."
5,AMAZING!!!!,well all i can really say is that the trio keeps getting better and this one is no different
5,A few simple words that add up to a timeless treasure.,"Taking a refreshingly simple approach to a very complex subject, Thomas has given young people, and those older people who still seek insight in all places, a wonderful perspective from which to view the most basic Christian principles. Unencumbered by hidden agenda, or an author's need to correct the social problems of the day, this book achieves more in its few beautiful words than others could hope to achieve in volumes. The youngest child and the most experienced adult cannot help but hear its gentle message about the joy of keeping Jesus first in our hearts and sharing that joy with others."
5,Jesus Loves the Little Children,"This book was the first book I remember my mother reading to me. I had memorized the book and wanted each of my children to know the different things Jesus did and who He is. Now I've made sure each of my grandchildren have this book. As much as the story meant to me, the new edition with contemporary pictures and so much color will keep their attention and mean more to them."
5,The Real Thing!,This is an exciting show that has 2 members of Saxon. These 2 were also in SOB along with another member. That was the original Saxon. So actually there are 3 original members of this band and only 2 in the tired old Biff led version. Biff is fading fast he's not good anymore. Oliver Dawson Saxon plays the classic songs the way they were meant to be. Steve Dawson did write the majority of the hits. They are all here. The guitars are turned way up on Saxon chronicles because Biff can't sing anymore! John Ward sings these songs like Biff used to and the band is really tight. Highly recommended with hit after hit. Nice ending in the credits too. Watch it to see what I mean.
