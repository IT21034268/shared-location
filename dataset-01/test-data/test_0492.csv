1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","Lasted 8 months, now nothing happens - suspect that the thermal fuse has gone, but cannot find instructions on how to reset, if at all possible. Might be the best pencil sharpener ever - while it works, but now it is an expensive paper weight, at least until I can get around to calling up the returns department and pay for it to be sent in for repairs.Addendum 11/01/10: I just heard from Panacare - USA that they no longer have, and will no longer be receiving replacement models for any (including the upright version) of their electronic sharpeners. They are now refunding the cost of the models to anyone who sends them a broken model within one year of purchasing it (receipt required). Thus, the Panasonic electric sharpeners are discontinued in the U.S.."
2,Plastic Gears,Bought two of these over the past three years. They worked great until one day they didn't. Turns out the gears are plastic and the teeth break off. Looks like it's made to last until you take it apart. Don't waste your money.
4,It is good and efficient,It does its work and save me time. I hope it can be a little smaller and take less space.
5,A must-have for any fan!,"This is an excellent, well-organized collection of every 007 tidbit you could imagine! Mr. Rubin has gone to great lengths to include some very interesting bits of trivia, and also very good information about the series' actors, stuntmen, producers, and other crew from over the years. However, if you are not a diehard fan, most of the information in this book would be somewhat useless."
2,Not as good as I thought.,"When I order this book I hope a very good Bond book with great pictures. But it was very disappointing. The all black and white pictures look old and some have bad quality. You may think that of course a picture form the movie Goldfinger must look old because it's a movie from the early sixties but, you know what I mean. I have seen pictures from Thunderball and other movies in full color and look spectacular but not in this book. And much of the info seems like ""I don't care at all about this fact"" Anyway, if you are a very big Bond fan, you should try this one, but if you don't, forget it immediately."
2,iT WON'T LAST,I purchased this pencil sharpener for my classroom. The students are not allowed to use the sharpener but I sharpen pencils for them. The reviews I read stated this but I tho't I would give it a try. It is very costly to only have for 6 months because it was well taken care of and now I don't have a clue of who to return it to.
2,Not too pleased,"You'd think for the amount of money that you paid, that this would be the last pencil sharpener that you would ever have to buy--but that's not the case. I teach 8th grade math at a middle school with 6 (six) classes per day, and so I bought two of them so my students wouldn't have to wait in long lines everyday. They just couldn't hold up, not even for the whole school year!! Actually I've had cheaper sharpeners that lasted much longer, so I looked up online the specs of these sharpeners too see if there was anything I could do. They mentioned cleaning them, to make sure no shavings were caught in the gears, but that's all. One of the sharpeners stopped working altogether, the motor wouldn't respond???"
2,Doesn't last,"I am a second grade teacher and have now had 3 of these. I rarely let kids use this after the first one went belly up. The company was kind enough to replace the first one but I'm disappointed with the performance. I really like how they work and sharpen, but if you sharpen hard wood pencils, it seizes up the motor. I wish they would have higher quality parts. The gears inside are plastic and very little inside is NOT plastic. I won't buy another one because I sharpen maybe 30 pencils 2-3 times a week (which doesn't sound like much to me for a ""high volume"" pencil sharpener) and still it doesn't last beyond about 5 months. It's just too expensive to justify buying it again."
2,bait and switch,I ordered the Boston 1606 pencil shapener. Instead I was shipped the X-Acto model 41. I know of the quality of the 1606 and know nothing of the model 41. I would have at least expected some sort of notification that a change was being made with my authorization. Amazon and Discount Office Supplies need to change their business practices.
3,Not his greatest..,"I am a great fan of Jay Z, always have been, always will be. Having said that this was not his greatest album. It will not go down as a classic and hardly worth him coming out of ""retirement"" for. Hopefully his next album will live up to the high standard that we hold Jay Z in and he will be back to reclaim his thrown as the greatest rapper alive.."
3,ok,"I really don't like rap or hip hop but i respect these rap artists. What i don't like is that fans of hip hop music are always putting everyone else down if they don't listen to rap like pop, country, dance or rock. I especially find it amusing that guys are called [...]if we listen to pop or dance music and we get beat up for it. Guys who listen to dance look stupid? I don't think so. What looks so stupid is white guys dressing up like thugs and blasting their car stereos to hip hop. Now that looks so stupid. I'm sorry but any person who isn't black who listens to hip hop look so stupid."
1,"Gay-Z, K-Feds album is pure genius","This is the worst album ever released. I thought Chingy's latest album was pure garbage. But this album takes the cake. I will use the inside notes to wipe my butt. People talk about K-Fed, he is so much more talented then Jay-Z could ever dream about being. Jay-z, please do us a favor and stay retired and please take the botox out of your lips"
3,not another ali,i believe any champion knows when they should have retired but for some reason always feels like they have one more bottle of lightning. thanks for the black album jay the album that allowed you to go out on top.
2,No main topic,"I heard three songs and was like next....And why are people giving this album ""4"" even ""5"" stars? His last album ""The black album"" was way better and dont front people cuz ya know it was. Besides - what do Cats from Italy or Guayana know about real hip-hop?"
1,I can't imagine Jay putting out a more disappointing album.,"This new album by Hov is unbelievably bad; easily the worst album of his career. All the beats and his flow just sound so tired and weak. Sounds like he was going for a real poppy sound on a lot of this or something. It reminds me of Eminem's 'Encore' album the way his whole sound just completely fell off. I thought of giving him two stars for at least attempting something new with the weird 'Beach Chair' beat, but honestly, I'd rather listen to generic street rap than this weak stuff."
4,Jay-Z can do no wrong,"Jay-Z has gotten a lot of flack for this album, but I still like it. It's definately not his best, but still great. Jay-Z is constantly reinventing himself, and this is a great example of this. People expect this album to be another Reasonable Doubt, but thats not realistic. Jay-Z is no longer on the corner selling drugs or whatever hustle he was doing in Brooklyn. He is now in his thirties and working corporate America, so it only make sense that lyrics reflects his life. I have to say, Jay-Z is the only rapper that can make a whole album about the rich lifestyle and make it this good. This is an album for hip-hop fans, not rap fans. Rapfans just want to hear about guns, sex, money and drugs. Hip-hop fans understand that the music is a reflection life. Maybe i'm just being bias because Jay-Z can do no wrong in my opinion."
4,Hot CD... Did his Thing By Going Left,"I think this CD is definitely the best CD of the year so far. Maybe Nas' joint will top it but this is that Crakk... Best songs on the album Ride with Me, Intro, 30 Something, and Dig a Hole.Jay's been hogging the mic on his last few though. I wouldn't mind seeing him collab with other artists, but if anyone can hold a CD down by himself it's Jay."
5,Very Impressed,"I'm not a big fan of Hip Hop, but I love this CD out of what little I have of him. When I purchase two copies (one for the car and residence) of a particular CD, you have earned my respect. Don't hate the player, hate the game!"
2,disappointing,"You know you have a bad album when the track dr.dre produced sucks. the beats were wack,i havent been this disappointed since the blueprint 2."
3,Solid release but I expected much more,"After hearing albums like Reasonable Doubt, Blueprint & The Black Album this sounds like a rushed recording. Blaze brings complete fire on ""Show me what you got"" but his other 2 tracks sound like something that should of been on a B-side. Jays flow is lacking that swagger that makes him so good on most of the album. I enjoyed the live recordings from reasonable doubt on the bonus disc more than the album itself overall. I love the live instruments for a change, it is refreshing. If you are a hardcore Jay fan you will enjoy but this one is along the lines of Dynasty/Blueprint2."
4,A decent comeback!,"This is a pretty good return to the game. On paper this album looks like it should be another classic with half the beats produced by Dr. Dre, but it falls short mainly due to the other tracks. This is an album full of hits and misses. This is one of the few Jay-Z albums where there is actually filler. The highlights are ""Lost One"", ""Trouble"", ""Kingdom Come"", ""Show Me What You Got"" and ""Do You Wanna Ride""."
3,Kingdom Come,"I was very suprised by how good this album actually was, as I have never been a big fan of Jay Z and the black album wasn't up to scratch. A few of the songs on this album are a bit stale such as 30 something, but most songs are ok. My favourites have to be hollywood where Jay Z has a really good flow, two others would be lost one ad minority report where Jay Z delivers an important message. Overall, it is worth getting this album as it has some decent songs and a banging beats in trouble and beach chair. By the way I'm not a kid!!!"
5,Solid Ep with some lo fi touches,"This EP establishes him as a true, young, singer-songwriter. His songs has substance and poetic resonance. Teeny-bopper magazines consider him to one of the most handsome new guys on the block, but who really cares unless you are one of them, and I'm not. His music is what I care about, it's strong and whimsical. Mr. Rice's voice is wispy and seasoned, like a hoarse John Mayer, but his music is far more adventurous and sophisticated. On ""Stay At Home"" he employs a children's choir and toy piano, while the song that kicks off the recording is like a sunny daydream. He makes the biggest artistic risk by recording ""Put Me In Your Holy War"" in such a lo-fi way that it suggests an ancient King Biscuit Flower Hour recording from the south. It's a risky thing to do because I'm sure it will catch some listeners off guard, but I like it."
5,Best book to learn from!,I have been learning to write for many years. Then I found this book and everything became clear. I also teach and I will be using this as a textbook for my class. It's that good.
1,Stopped Sharpening!!,"I got this Pencil sharpener two or three months agoIt was working fine when I got it it sharpened very well. However it dose not sharpen the whole pencil, so you have to rotate it while sharpening.After a moth maybe a little more; it stopped sharpening the motor was still running but it was not sharpening.I found this product very disappointing."
4,It could be better,"There is a lot going for this terrific CD, Peter Maffay is great by himself, unfortunately Über Sieben Brücke is wrecked by a terrible female support singer. If you love this song try another Maffay album which features an earlier version. Good luck!"
5,There are more cool books out there!,"Fun book! And there are more cool books out there!The Outsiders from Amsterdam in The Netherlands as described in this book, have a biography of their own!See the author's webpage: jeromeblanes.blogspot.com"
2,"Interesting topic, terrible writing.",I bought this with such high anticipation. The writing is so boring it has made me *not* want to check out any of the bands listed. And the interviews are so limited... Plus there are grammatical errors galore - don't they proofread books before publishing?
1,Not worth the money,"In the box, this looks great, and it's made by a reputable company. However, it is a miserable pencil sharpener for those who care about a perfectly sharpened pencil. It's slow, noisy, and the ""auto-stop"" feature is practically non-existent. The only way you know when your pencil has been completely sharpened is when you remove it from the sharpener and look at the point... again and again.Instead, you might want to look into any of the Panasonic electric sharpeners. I own two, and they are perfect -- the auto-stop really works, they're fast, and they produce the most perfect points from any sharpener I've ever seen. I wanted to like the Boston sharpener, but it just didn't happen."
3,Pretty good,This product is pretty good. It is cheap and it is pretty good quality. I needed a pencil shapener bad and this one was the cheapest yet
2,Not a fan.,"I purchased this sharpener because it was advertised as a heavy-duty school sharpener. As a middle/high school math teacher, pencils are always being sharpened in my class. I found that this sharpener does a very poor job sharpening, so the kids are out of their seats more to sharpen. Additionally, this sharpener is obnoxiously loud. The noise is quite disruptive to my teaching and to the kids when they're trying to concentrate. I would not purchase this item again, and nor would I recommend it."
2,Heavy Duty--Not likely,"Agree with some of the other teachers that have reviewed this product. I bought this item after going through several electric sharpeners. I teach high school math, so a sharpener is in high demand. The motor is fantastic--it's outlasted every other sharpener that I've owned. The blades...well, the blades were effective for about 6 months. Now only one side of the pencil gets sharpened, leaving the other edge of the pencil with a thin skin of wood over the graphite. I have found that the more expensive pencils (like Ticonderogas) tend to work better, but most pencils just don't sharpen any more. I now use the X-Acto School Pro as an over-priced paper weight. The 6 dollar hand crank with vaccuum works better than this."
1,Don't Bother...,...especially if you're in a Primary Classroom. This pencil sharpener lasted 3 months after heavy use. I have yet to find a pencil sharpener that can stand up to a Primay classroom.
1,So confused!,"I bought this exact sharpener three years ago for my classroom and it lasted three years before a student decided to sharpen a pen in it. I automatically decided to get the same sharpener despite the less-than-stellar reviews I'd seen online, because I've had great luck with it. When I received the sharpener, I plugged it in and started to sharpen a pencil and immediately noticed a huge difference. The new sharpener takes 5 minutes (yes, I timed it!) to sharpen one pencil. This will NOT work in my classroom, so I'm currently attempting to get my money back and looking for a new sharpener to invest in. I guess all those naysayers were right on the money!"
1,"defective design, should be discontinued","Our school bought lots of these, and like other reviewers explained, they all crapped out after just a little usage. the metal on metal ""sleeve bearing"" ends up vibrating (and making horrible noise) and ultimately rendering it useless. Why they haven't recalled this product is a mystery to me. Being a science teacher, I tried to take it apart and modify it to work, but it was not ""fixable"" (all the other teachers sent me theirs to fix too). So it ended in frustration and a waste of money (and no sharpener). My advise? DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Didn't last one month!,"I'm a fourth grade teacher who spends a lot of time sharpening pencils for my students after school every day. I bought this sharpener, hoping it would last at least for one year. When I first used it, you can tell that the machine feels very delicate and cheap already but it did sharpen very sharp. It's barely been about 3 weeks since I bought it and just yesterday, I was putting a pencil in and it just stopped sharpening. The machine was still on and working with the sounds noticeable but it just didn't sharpen the pencil anymore. I was so mad. I am also not into taking my time to write a review for any product but it was a waste of money so I wanted to get the word out. Don't buy this cheap sharpener. It was about $85 at office depot but it's not What u pay for. It's a very cheap quality and won't last for not even a month. What a rip off!"
4,pencil sharpener,"I like:1. multiple openings for even the kids BIG pencils2. Doesn't ""burn out"" after sharpening at least 50 pencils3. large cup for pencil shavings4. Can sharpen colored pencilsBummer:It started making a strange sound after about a month. No decrease in performance yet, but maybe it's coming???"
3,I want something better,"I'm a Middle School Math Teacher in an over-crowded public school . . . so I know a thing or two about pencil sharpeners. I've owned two of these ""heavy-duty"" sharpeners, and while they are better than most, neither made it through their 3rd year. Overall performance is great for the first year, but steadily deteriorates with age. As it gets older, the sharpened pencil point isn't on-center and the blades become too dull to be effective (the motor is just fine though). I've also had other, less expensive electric sharpeners too (donated by generous parents) but the one's that cost half as much don't even last half as long. :-(Anyhow, the abuse an 11 to 14 year-old can dish out is too much for even this ""heavy-duty"" model and if I'm spending my money for a sharpener, there's got to be something better."
2,was supposed to work for colored pencils,"Works great for regular pencils but colored pencils destroyed it....less than 1 year old. Tried to clean blades but does not help. Use for regular pencils only, get something else for colored pencils."
1,"Loud, slow, wears out","Had this unit in classroom and could not put up with the noise. Upgraded to a Bostitch and it's much quieter and faster. To be fair, I thought the speed was OK until using it side by side with the Bostitch. Our school also has gone through many of these, so we are upgrading all of ours to Bostitch."
1,Sub-par sharpener,"I've owned two of these for my seventh grade classroom. The first one became completely dull after about 6 months of use. With the second one, students were complaining that it wasn't sharpening--on the FIRST DAY I had it in my classroom! This is NOT a ""heavy-duty"" sharpener as advertised (although it DOES make a heavy-duty noise). I will try something else for my third sharpener."
1,Rip-Off for Teachers!,"I got this sharpener for my elementary students to use. I have designated responsible students as ""The Pencil Sharpeners."" Sadly enough within 2 months, these students would start with this electric sharpener and then move to the old fashioned crank model. They got tired of struggling to get a point on pencils with this 2 month old DULL electric sharpener. Sadly I have to admit that I bought one of these sharpeners once before, and it quickly wore out. Why did I buy it again? I'm a lowly paid teacher who can't afford to personally shell out $50 for worthless pencil sharpeners. Something tells me from the ratings that X-Acto knows they are ripping teachers off!"
2,A big disappointment to anyone who's seen the broadway show,"The Broadway cast for this show was awesome. There are some included on the CD (e.g.-Michael Lanning, and ""Broadway All Stars""), but Hootie sings one of Keith Byron Kirk's songs (his best was excluded from the album), and quite honestly massacres it. Kirk has an incredible voice that demands to be heard, and cannot on this album. Plus Bebe Winans, who is an excellent gospel singer, sings a gospel song, ""River Jordan"", which was sung unbelievable well (and in my opinion better) by the Broadway cast member. Travis Tritt (not in the Broadway version) does an excellent job on ""The Day the Sun Stood Still"", and Michael Lanning is excellent on the songs he sings, both on this album and in the play. In addition, the songs sung by the Broadway All Stars, especially ""By the Sword/Sons of Dixie"" were well done. Overall a disappointment. If Atlantic had a clue, they would have recorded the original cast."
5,OMG AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME,I saw this amazing show while in Gettysburg where it is now called FOR THE GLORY and believe me they need to put this back on broadway! The music is so moving yet its so modern it really catches the younger crowd. Getting this cd just brings me back to the theatre where I experienced this awesome musical!
3,What could have been,"I am an acknowledged fan of Frank Wildhorn. In spite of what many people claim he is doing to musical theatre, I applaud each and every one of his efforts...and I applaud the Civil War, in spite of what it is and could have been. First, to the music. This CD is not a recording of the Broadway production. It is a studio cast, designed to showcase the songs and the talents of the recording artists. In that respect, it is a wonderful work of (mainly) country music and country artists. Some of the songs are downright beautiful (Linda Eder in ""I Never Knew His Name"" and Trisha Yearwood's ""the Honor of Your Name"") and some are just passable, but I do credit Frank Wildhorn for attempting a bold fusion of modern music to tell a well-known tale from a different angle. This CD is definitely not for everyone, but if you enjoy country music and modern pop, you'll at least enjoy the recording on that level."
4,Excellent highlighter,"I'm a researcher and live and die by highlighters. This one puts out a lot of ink easily without bearing down much which I love and it lasts a long time. It's thicker than an average writing pen which makes it perfect for precise marks. The tip is narrow so you don't overlap lines and it flexes so I get a solid highlight. I hate the fat ones because the tip is too rigid and they pickup ink, this one doesn't. Only one drawback: You pay for what you get so it's a bit more than the fatties. Ironically even if the well is empty it keeps going!"
2,"They look neat, that's about all they've got going for them.","I bought these because I thought they would last. I was excited at first because they worked well, leaving very bright ink on the page. However, as other reviewers point out, the ink just runs out much too quickly! Each barrel comes about half-filled too. You can see on the packaging where the black ""Sharpie"" logo comes done to meet the yellow ink. This is the point where they are filled to. Disappointing."
5,An Incredible Approach to the Moral Life,"It has been 10 years since I read this book, but I remember being blown away by Fr. Pinckaer's approach. I was reading this in juxtaposition to some very legalistic approaches to ethics and Fr. Pinckaer's writing was fresh, free, and liberating. As someone else put in a review, Pinckaer's approach is one of freedom for excellence. The Beatitudes are the place he starts his reflection on the moral life of the Christian. This book is beautiful and an indispensable read for those who want to be familiar with the renewal of Christian moral theology."
5,Great Book!,This book is awesome! I bought it years ago at some bookstore for like $5 or something equally minimal. It has a cheerful cover and makes a great conversation piece. I am in sales so anything to help cheer me up always helps!There are a lot of excellent quotes which give perspective on life situations and help to see the positive side of things.Great book for a gift or as a quick reference.
4,Nice little steam cleaner,Lightweight and easy to use. I do wish it had a bigger reservior to suck up the water. I had a HOover steam cleaner and it didn't have a powerful sucktion as this one did.
2,Not impressed!,"I thought it would vacuum also, I guess it is not, just a steam cleaner. Not even a steam cleaner just a cleaner. It does not produce steam. Very hard to clean out the dirty water canister. Paid a little more for a Bissell higher model number (2090), thought it was a better product."
1,Garbage written by a 20-something with no experience,"I had to read this book for a course at a fundamentalist college. Can you imagine? A college course, half of the grade of which was based on garbage written by a 20-something who had no experience in dating?This was an Evangelical fad that has, thankfully, waned in popularity. Not only has it messed some teenagers' minds up, but it has also validated the insecurities of people who have grown bitter and defensive for their lack of social skills and normal relationships."
5,Great book to get you started,"Yeah, a lot of the stuff he covers is review for some of us, but there are enough gems for all of us. Sure, he came from a guy's perspective (which is evident), so it is geared a little bit more toward guys I think. I've heard from some good friends that ""When God Writes Your Loves Story"" by Eric & Leslie Ludy may be geared more toward women.In any case, there is a lot of new insights for many of us, if we take the chance to read it through. Would highly recommend!"
5,"love it, great to share with your family for the holiday's",love the CD purchased it because I like it when I heard it from a friend and the only place I could find it was on-line. The only problem was the case was cracked.thank you and it made my Christmas more enjoyable
1,Not the soundtrack,The tracks listed here as being associated with the first run feature film THE NATIVITY STORY are not the soundtrack. I don't know what this is that's being sold this way. The soundtrack is by Mychal Danna and is to die for. His rendition of SILENS NOX is unlike anything you've ever heard and the way he crafted music to underscore the visual images is enough to move you to tears. The songs listed above are not part of the movie.
2,Barely adequate,"This book contains the bare basics one would need for a trip. It's somewhat outdated and isn't nearly as comprehensive as the Rough Guide for Tuscany and Umbria, which is a much, much better book. Had this been the only guidebook I had, my trip would have been much less enjoyable. Its information for towns in Tuscany and Umbria outside of Florence is minimal. For a much better trip, buy the Rough Guide instead."
4,Would be better if it didn't run out of ink,"I am a college student and need reliable highlighters when I am studying. I bought these because I thought they would be a good value. The yellow and pink ones didn't last too long, but orange, blue and green work fine."
1,Not the right Wig...,"I really needed a Red wig for my Halloween costume, as that was one of the main features of the costume! The picture looked absolutely perfect for what I was going for, yet when it arrived I received a totally different wig than what's in the picture. The wig that I received was a brown wig, shorter than the one in the picture, and called a 'Starlet wig'. So I must return it and get another. I would not recommend this seller, as the item received is much unlike the item described. =[ =["
1,Junk!! Poor plastic internal gears,"This product is complete JUNK. It should be banned. Negative comments abound here, but there are so few electrics anymore people are desparate. Internal gears are VERY FLIMSY PLASTIC that destroy each other. I took mine apart when it died and the problem is obvious: extremely poor quality parts!! It is built to fail! If you must get it, keep receipt and box and plan to return. With daily use, I would expect it to last approximately 30 days. If you buy with Amex, they may double the mfg wrrty and handle chargeback...not sure."
1,Broke in a few months! very disappointed,"Even though this product was called ""heavy use"", it broke after 3 months of 1 person use. Motor died. I went to website and there is no warranty for this product. rip-off!"
1,Motor burned out after 4 months,"Powerhouse this ain't. It jammed often, and the motor died after 4 months for no good reason. Don't waste your money. I'm going to go buy as old-fashioned a manual crank pencil sharpener as I can...from back when they knew how to make them."
5,Fit and function are excellent,It took a bit of ingenuity and muscle to get the old spindle out but once I did this went right in and I had it back together in no time. Very happy with the results. I highly recommend the use of a floor jack and using an air impact gun.
5,Great,Item as described. Top quality AAA service. I would recommend this to anyone with a lawn to mow. Its great!
4,Track Listing,1. Lipstick2. Love3. Truth4. What I Came Here For5. Not The First Time (BBC Live Mix)6. Overgrown (BBC Live Mix)7. Love (Alternative Version)
2,A Big Disappointment in a little package,"This isn't one of those books that inspires you to keep coming back time and again for ideas. One you've flipped through its small, poorly bound pages - you're through. Nothing here to make you want to return. The title is misleading - there is no indexing of ideas - just a compilation of fictious projects."
5,"Aim for the Heart is a first-rate ""How-To "" for TV journalists","Al Tompkins scores with a practical guide to make pictures and words compelling, even for a novice TV reporter."
1,One single squashed votive for $4.99??,"I couldn't find anywhere in the description that this was only one single votive, which came to me squashed on both sides. They are only 99 cents on the Yankee Candle website!![...]What the heck?"
1,What a piece of JUNK!!!,Warning - Do Not Waste Your Money. We purchased this in January 2006. It's now May 2006 and the thing is WORTHLESS. Fortunately this item came from Staples and they are going to give me full credit for an exchange with another (different) pencil sharpener.
2,OVER RATED,JUST CUZ MAC DRE FROM UP NORTH AND YOU FROM UP NORTH DONT MEAN THAT THIS ALBUM GETS 5 STARS!ON ALL THE TRACKS I JUST HEAR HIM MUMBLING.HIS EARLIER S*IT WAS COO.THATS IT.DONT COP THIS ALBUM.IF YOU NEED A MIRROR OR SOMETHING TO SNORT OFF OF THEN YOU MIGHT WANNA GET THIS S*IT.
3,Good product,It works very good but you have to be able to get past the taste. Personally I thought it tasted horrible and would rather take vitex berry capsules
4,"It works but,","I really liked that it was working for me. After years of trying for a baby we found out that it was going to be very hard for me because I have PCOS. It was making things so much better for my life things were starting to get on track and I was a 33 day cycle again for the first time in 4 years. But here's the kicker it tasted so bad. The first few weeks it was alright, but after some time it got to the point I couldn't even take a quick shot of it anymore. I am going to try FertiliTea and see if it works if not I guess ill just have to come up with a new way to choke this product down. It does work though so if you have tried other things it is really really worth the try. Maybe you guys can come up with a better way of taking it. ^_^"
2,Do not stack well - returned them,"I was told it would be helpful to buy stacking cups, so I found these. Like a couple of other reviewers, upon receiving them, I was disappointed. These cups are very small and the lip area is small. The cups do not stack well at all. I had trouble with the larger cups, the smaller cups were ridiculous. I returned these and will look for cups that stack better.I will admit, if you wanted something for your child to play with, toss around, these are okay and an okay price. For the purpose of stacking, these just are not that great. Disappointed."
1,This is not worth the money,These cups are not worth the money that is being charged. The display pictures make them look much bigger than they are. In fact the smallest cup could be a choking hazard for smaller kids. You are better off buying measuring cups at K-mart for $3.00.
3,It Works,"I bought this product in July, after experiencing many problems with the Solar Centurion security lights. I went through two and neither ever worked as advertised. So far the STI has survived hurricane Ike and still lights my back stairs. My neighbor says it works well when he leaves for work about one in the morning. My only problem has been that I really couldn't adjust the motion sensor to activate the light at exactly the spot I wanted it to. But, it's way better than the solar centurion."
4,"nontraditional dark, horror, and surreal","If you revel in nontraditional writing styles, there are usually a few interesting jewels exemplified in these Borderlands compilations. The stories are at times surreal, horrific, fantastical, dark, or just plane strange. I highly recommend this to anyone who most enjoys the books that twist the common method or presentation of a story's progression or even the subject matter. See my review of Borderlands 1 for similar comments..."
2,Deceptive labeling,"I ordered this product from Buy.com via Amazon, because the ad had it labeled as a Hunt product, and said nothing about X-Acto. This was after reading the Amazon reviews, of which several said the similar product by X-Acto was inferior, but sharpener by Hunt was good. However, they sent me the X-Acto product called the XLR, #1818. Notice that the picture of the product doesn't say X-Acto on the front, but the real thing they send you does. So both Amazon and Buy.com are selling the same product, but Buy.com's is deceptively labelled as Hunt. And the product box also says ""by Boston"", but the bottom says distributed by Elmer's Products, Made in China. What nonsense! I'm going to give the product a try, but am not pleased with how it's handled."
2,Puerile,"I found Schwartz's retelling of the founding of Islam sophomoric and completely uncritical. If you read this book, read something - anything - to balance it's slanted perspective. Let's face it, Islam (like its Christian progenitor) spread by the sword. With regard to it's contemporary ""analysis"", i.e., that the House of Saud is the primary funder of Wahhabist terrorism: duh. Duh. Save your money."
3,XL are too tight for size 14 foot.,"Like most XL socks they are too small. Size 14 is just big not huge. xl socks average a minimum of $15 a pair and only last a year and shrink way too much. Who can afford that anyway. Why are dress socks so hard to find? Do tall people never work in offices? Never need affordable socks for all occasions in life in a reasonable amount of colors? Not to mention tall people need assistance with circulation not xl socks that are too small with elastic that cuts of circulation, a big deal for tall people.Sock manufactures need to wake up! There is so much they could learn about quality control. People are going to keep getting taller."
4,Comfortable but require care,"Good comfortable socks but they require more laundry care than typical socks. good work socks, though. A bit more expensive but if you're on your feet, they're great"
3,Where's the yoga?,"Good moderately paced kickbox routine. No yoga. The warmup and cooldown contain stretches, but no yoga. I would rate this a high beginner or low intermediate workout."
1,Body fat measurements inconsistent and inaccurate,"As a weight scale, this product is fine, as a bodyfat measure it is completely useless. So far this month I've lost 7 pounds and 1.5 inches off my waist but this thing has my bodyfat up one day, down the next, it is wildly inconsistent and therefore useless. I bought a skinfold caliper and am now using it daily to get accurate bodyfat measurements."
4,Nice looking and work as expected,"These look great and we are very happy with them. Make sure you pay attention the measurements as they looknbugger than we expected, but are the listed size. The only complaint I have about them is that the weight if them seems to make themmdroopnslightly so the lightsnarenabout 5degrees off from vertical. I only noticed as imwas cleaning the dust off them from from some dry wallmwork. Huey lookngreat thigh and we are happy with them. ."
1,Bad literature book,It's a romance with bad literature; i read the first ten pages and stopped; it's not a technical text about trilobites.
2,Was it all bad?,"This biography presents the life and times of Peter Sellers like a case study of neurosis and unfulfillment. I don't doubt the accuracy of the ""tortured soul"" treatment the author pursues or the facts of the predicaments Sellers found himself in throughout his life. Failed projects and marriages, poor health and financial woes are on the record. The few instances of joyful periods the author provides though, including examples of sublime artistic creation, are brief and quickly segue into a dismal perspective of their futility. Doesn't seem to me an authentic or rounded depiction of a life, rather a oddly slanted portrayal of a most interesting performer."
3,not my favorite firm dvd,"Most of the time the Firm dvd's offer a great workout, but I am not so sure about this one. The instructor seems kind of robot like and doesn't have much in the way of personality. To me the instructor needs to make it fun and be personable to make it worthwhile. She does offer a good workout besides the robotix."
3,Not my favorite,"I just got the transFIRMer 2 mos ago and I fell in love with it so I started looking for more. This caught my eye because it is from the new transFIRMATION series and from a new instructor, so I was hoping this was going to be good. Well... I miss my transFIRMer. I miss doing lunges on the incline, and using the transfirmer as a bench when I do chest press, etc... Maybe using only dumbbells might be pros for this exercise, but I found the exercise boring without use of steps. The instructor was hard to follow - added moves too quickly before doing reps, not enough cueing). I felt my back a little sore after the exercise, which is never the case with the other firm videos, maybe it is my bad forms but she did not give enough cues/reminders to stay in good form. Overall I'd stay away from this exercise."
1,Very bad instruction,"I got this as a Christmas present. I have been through many workout dvds and this is the worst. The workout was led by a poor instructor. No warm up session provided. Also basic steps of the workout routine were not properly showed. It will not work for beginner. The instructor assumed that audience knows her routine, so she just kept on changing move. It is hard to follow her moves and very frustrating. I would not recommend this workout to anyone."
4,Fit Grandma,"This is one of 4 new Firm videos I recently purchased - I've tried two now and am pleased with both. As noted by another reviewer Amazon is not listing this right, this is not the ""old"" Time Crunch with Susan Harris and Kai Soremekun. This is a ""new"" Time Crunch with Rebekah Sturkie. She does a great job, cuing and sound are good. It is a nice balance of aerobic bursts and weight work. I did up the weights for me and by my second go at the DVD I had the moves down as they are not too dancy and complicated as some DVDs have been. I'm 60 years old, working out about 1 hour each AM and have been looking for DVDs that have less high impact in them now and this works well for that - some high impact but not too much. I have two more new Firm DVDs to review - hope I like them as well. It is always disheartening to order an exercise DVD and play it to only find out it is a lemon."
4,A well done mildly silly hip hop album,"I first heard of Fat Hed from cdr's by a group called Halifax All-Stars that I picked up at Amoeba. The group was a hip-hop crew set up with a great producer by the name of Nocturnal Ron. Apparently ""Night Train to Babbleon"" is the first decently-distributed real cd to come out of that group. It makes a really good ""indie party rap"" cd. Mr. Hed's vocal stylings have a somewhat cartoon-character-like quality that remind me of Biz Markie. The production on many of these songs is mighty fine too. Nocturnal Ron does the duties for more than half the songs - his style is pleasurably chunky and rough-around the edges sample-based stuff, similar to parts of Wu-Tang Clan's second disc. Kutmasta Kurt also produces a track. Hopefully soon we'll see a decently-distributed real cd from some of the other Halifax members or Gershwin BLX."
1,Body-Head Bangin,"Just saw this and had to go back on this review. My taste in rap has matured greatly. This stuff is about a whole lot of nothing. Search for more underground hip-hop, because all the artists who have something to say worth hearing aren't accepted by the corporations."
1,Cyberporn is addictive,"As a psychologist specializing in sexuality, I found this book not at all qualifying as a professional offering. Odzer gives us pornography herself, and justifies it by her ""analysis."" Cybersex isn't normal sex, its symptomatic of loneliness and isolation, and often addiction. Readers shouldn't be reassured, but rather helped to take a look at what is missing from their social and love lives. Anyone who does more than take an occasional look at cyberporn should be worried."
1,doesn't hold,This device is only useful if you never move it and if it is subject to no vibrations at all. The slighest bump and it becomes dislodged.
5,a hottie,This is a great product.IT really helps you out. It is good way to store and protect your CDS. i give it 5 stars.
1,Outdated and Impractical,"The vast majority of the proposals forwarded by the author are unfortunately simple and contribute to the cynicism towards environmental activists. Ideas such as the ban on all world fishing is 1)unenforcable, 2)unneccessary 3)politically and economically impossible. The economies of entire nations, such a Iceland and Norway, depend on fishing. Responsible fishing of sustainable stocks is the answer, not the rambling solutions Ms. Michener proposes!Phil Swanwick, Vice-President, Friends of the Earth Society"
4,Excellent product for the price,"Let me start by saying that I have a DVR through my cable service, so I use that more than anything else to record programs. I do have some DVDs and VHS tapes that I like to play occasionally, though, so I thought this combo unit would be good for me. It does everything it's supposed to -- no complaints about scanning or picture or sound. It was easy enough to hook up, and it's easy to use. I do need to wear my glasses to use the remote -- tiny buttons and lettering. This unit is nothing fancy, but I think it's a really good product, especially considering the price."
5,Rapido y Conciso,"An excellent dictionary when you want a one-word definition, and still, words with multiple meanings are clearly laid out. Easy to read. Tending toward short entries. A joy for simple translation and a relief for vocabulary-building.There are adequate sections on pronunciation, grammar, and conjugation. There are lists of common irregular verbs in Spanish and in English.Encountering a foreign word for the first time, it is by definition unfamiliar. I was too often frustrated by otherwise-wonderful dictionaries which were simply hard to read (and my near-sight is excellent). This is by far my favorite of all the Spanish-English dictionaries I've seen.Advanced students will want a more advanced dictionary (and possibly a magnifying glass, probably not needed here). For the other 99.9% of (us) Spanish learners, this is a great find."
1,Misleading picture,"The colors are different from the package in the picture! It is actually only 1 yellow, green, red, orange, pink, & blue. I specifically bought this pack because I use yellow more often than darker colors & I was very disappointed when it came in. The product specifications say ""assorted colors."" I don't know if it is my fault for assuming the picture represented the actual product but I am definitely not satisfied with this purchase."
4,As good as it gets,Got this as a replacement for the same one that broke from freezing. It's sturdy and works well. Make sure you take good care of it. They do break. Definitely recommend. I saved money getting it online as well. The local pool shop is way more expensive.I don't think there's any better filter stystem than Hayward for an above ground pool. So get it if you need it. It's a good quality filter.
1,Lame!!!,"This movie is a little lame and not really worth buying. B-movie quality, boring, and not really what you expect."
3,not bad for what it is,"this movie was pretty good, i thought, i think it was made for vh1 so i wasn`t expecting much, but it was ok, i think they jump pretty far ahead from when they first started out, i would have liked to seen more about their beginning, but if your a def leppard fan you would like this movie, i like them and i play guitar,so it was a treat for me, iwas was good, it could have been better, but i liked it"
3,Pretty But Tight Fit,"This ring is very beautiful, but it didn't fit my finger comfortably so I returned it. It also covers the bottom of your finger. If you are not used to wearing rings like that it might feel overwhelming. Silver Insanity provides incredible customer service and communication, a great seller."
4,Clever plot kept me turning the pages,"The beginning of Paper Lovers took me by surprise and had me glued to the book until the last page. The psychological nature of the plot was intriguing and I wondered how far the author would take the story. Pretty far, it turns out. This is definitely not a conventional romance. As I was enjoying the story, I began to see signs that it was an allegory about the romance novel industry. I don't know if the author intended this. However, reading the story in this way made the ending more acceptable to me. I wish I could explain that in more detail, but I don't want to give too much away. Paper Lovers would be a great book for a reading group; there's so much to analyze. I'm looking forward to Knadle's next book."
2,"Works fine, but installation is brutal","I prefer the flat design of the Dunlop Straplok to the Schaller ones that have those pegs that stick out and seem like they could be easily damaged. Unfortunately, the screws that came with the Dunlop item are garbage. They began to strip immediately. The slots are not deep enough for most screwdrivers and the metal is Ikea quality junk. The locking mechanism will work fine but now I am going to the hardware store TWICE for these -- once to purchase a narrower screwdriver, and now once to get replacement screws. My opinion of Jim Dunlop products has been lowered significantly now. If they are this haphazard with such a simple item, what about the pedals and more complex products they produce?"
3,Encylopedia of martial arts.,"The cover says ""A very informative and well-rounded explanation of fighting."" This is not a training book. It is a detailed record of various styles. I bought this book in order to see if I could learn a new move or maybe a new training tip. This book seems to be a lot like an encylopedia of martial art styles. There is a short description of every martial art imaginable and some you have never heard of. If you are experienced and looking to learn some new techniques to use in the gym then this book is not for you. This would be good to read about the different rules of different martial arts. Maybe I should have read reviews on this book. I bought this book for the wrong purpose."
3,Mediocre highlighters,"I am a college student, so I use highlighters a lot. I have these highlighters, as well as several other brands. These are okay, they get the job done, but they don't last very long."
2,"OK, But Frustrating !","The CD holders are set as rolodex cards and fall out ALL the time ! The Storage case is very strong and nice, the freebie visor holder is a bonus. BUT I would not buy this again :-("
4,Easy Learning,"I am enjoying the Talk Now! Learn Bulgarian CD. Great images, repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words, numbers, time, etc. easy. Also, the games add interest. You can print out each section with photos and words in Bulgarian. However, I would have liked to see the program come with the Cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide."
5,realistic view of both sides of one coin,"This is a great story, that will carry you away back to a time when everything appears black and white. But in this book he shows you how grey life really is. His characters are involving and easy to get to know. It certainly is war and peace. But you won't put it down until the end."
3,informative,It was informative. I felt like there was too much about certain topics. I did enjoy reading it.
2,The Real Thing,"Save your money. Here's what you're looking for. Mrs. Field's didn't dare reveal her real recipe:Mrs. Fields' Secret Recipe for Chocolate Chip Cookies1 cup butter, softened1 cup sugar1 cup brown sugar2 eggs1 tsp. vanilla extract2 cups flour2 cups oatmeal (put in a blender or food processor until it turns to powder)tsp. salt1 tsp. baking powder1 tsp. baking soda12 oz. chocolate chips1/2 oz. hershey bar, grated1 cups chopped nuts (optional)Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cream together butter and sugars. Add eggs, one at a time, and vanilla extract. Mix together flour, powdered oatmeal, salt, baking powder and baking soda, and combine with batter. Add remaining ingredients. Make golf-ball size cookies, flattened, two inches apart. Bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 10-12 minutes. Makes 56 cookies."
3,Afrikakorps 1941-43 (Elite Series),"An interesting book, worth the price. However, it is only of passing interest as a collector's reference. I was somewhat disappointed in that not enough attention was devoted to material which would assist in authenticating uniforms and accouterments that are unique to the Deutsches Afrika Korps. Good text however, and easily read by high schoolers, possibly the target audience. Too bad the publisher didn't print the original color photos, in color."
1,Defective merchandise,"I purchased The Astaire & Rogers Collection Vol 2. When I went to play them I found that 3 of the 5 discs would not play. I tried them on a different player with the same results. 1- The Gay Divorcee 2- Roberta 3- Carefree, would not play. The other 2 movies are ok. 3 out of 5 is serious quality control issues. We all know these movies are ""good"". If you decide to buy this set, you had better check them as soon as they arrive. I stock pile movies and watch them at my leisure. I can see that I have to do my own quality control to protect myself. I can't help but ask myself if they knew there were defective discs in this set, would they let us know?"
1,Really Great Songs - There's A Better Choice,"As much as I love these old songs from the early Australian years, I must recommendBrilliant From Birth: Birth of Brilliance 2, a double disc remastered version containing 63 songs. It also has great liner notes. It costs more, but it is well worth it!"
4,But Read Truth and Justification,Amazon has really hyped this one for folks with my categories of interest and as a dialogue with supporting essays I found the relative closeness I felt with Habermas and Derrida interesting. The views of both in a discourse over the tragedy of 9/11 were close enough to the reader to touch. The discussion was in my living room. As one who normally reads Habermas for philosophical wisdom and has grown to avoid reading Derrida whenever possible -- what a difference! -- to avoid a loss of wisdom -- I felt this book was far more interview and less philosophy for some reason. The words were smaller than usual. The sentences shorter. There is the tie in with Europe's past of course. There is also the clear note that most American's are missing the bigger picture -- the European picture especially.Reading this book was the better part of an evening in many ways.
2,Bad connection inside,"I bought two of these for a car stereo install and at first everything seemed fine. After a few weeks I started having what sounded like ground loop noise from the left speaker but it was intermittent and tough to diagnose. Finally, I tried swapping the these connectors and the problem moved to the right side. Swapped the connectors back and the problem followed the connector back to the left side.So I went down to a local shop and paid the same price for a pair of connectors that I paid for one of these and the problem is gone."
1,Awful for children,"AWFUL!!! My English honors student is 12 and was incredibly upset by this book wherein the tiger, who is the boy's best friend throughout the book, is killed at the end by his father with for no apparent reason. My child is an animal lover and the senseless killing of a beautiful animal by the father was devastating. The book also contains the theme of bullying with no positive outcome to that as well. Very depressing."
3,A Kid With Problems,"Tiger Rising is really diffeernt from the books I read with my class before. The best part of the book is Rob Horton, a kid with many problems. Sistine is his friend; she has problems too. Rob Horton gets picked on and he has no friends, until he met Sistine Bailey. He has a rash on both legs that is really caused by him not being able to let go of his problems. Letting the tiger go is the dream of both Rob and Sistine. I really liked the book."
4,A book that protrays human emotions,"It is very hard to write a GOOD short book. I think Kate DiCamillo accomplished that. There are, unfortunately, some words that shouldn't be mentioned( Words like d*mn). Sistine(The main character's friend)and Rob, the main character, overcome emotional barriers.This book is read by fourth graders at school. There might be things that they don't really understand, like the things these characters go through. This includes Sistine's father having an affair. This might not be the best book to read in fourth grade but this is definitely a must read!"
2,"Great price,prompt delivery,but he did not like it.",What more can I say.I tried to buy something online that was hard to do.Suede is not easy to judge unless you touch it.I was completely satisfied with all the other parts of this purchase. I am sorry for us all that it didn't suit him.
4,THE FIRST ONE,"Malevo, the nick of Mr. Sergio H. Bermejo. a young argentinian composer.This CD is a must have.Because its a milestone in the history of electro-tango, Gotan Project and all the rest.Includes the great bandoneon player: Walter Rios. And strings arranged by Antonio Agri (Piazzolla's violinist)."
5,Powerful Piece for Women and the Men Who Love Them,"Even though it is clinical in spots, after years of reading books on similar subjects, this book is definitive in its value to women, especially to those of us who want clear and direct information. I recommend this book to all women, regardless of age, as well as the men who love them.Joanne Victoriahttp://www.JoanneVictoria.com"
2,Not so hot,I have used the Sony version of this CD disc changer and like the Sony a whole lot better. Unless the CD's you store have CD text you must make a list to keep track of what is loaded in this machine. It is also a pain to program. Between the two I would opt for the Sony CD Disc Changer. I am not impressed with the Pioneer.
5,Books and more books,I haven't read it yet but have not been disappointed yet in the Barnes & Noble Classic series. I have Vol 1 as well.
3,"Oh, well","I loved Sherlock Holmes as a child, as I mention in the review of the first volume, and continue to enjoy reading these classics as an adults. This book, like its predecessor, is well put together with one exception: Where are all of the original illustrations!?! A good book, but you would be better off with ""The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes.""Paul Buckner,Author of ""From Broke to Broker: Stories of Finding Financial Freedom."""
2,"Complete Sherlock Holmes, Vol.2","ONly good things abuot this are the ones w/Basil Rathbone. Others are trash. Do NOT waste your money, buy the Rathbone movies separately or in a group, without all the other so early nobody can remember them junk!Cecy Ivie."
4,Expensive but effective,"I decided to buy this after my son raved about it and I tried a little of his. Also checked out the reviews on MUA -- generally quite positive. The product seems quite expensive for what it is, which is why I rated it 4 rather than 5 stars. But a bottle lasts quite a long time even if used daily. I have been using this every morning. After making the wet paste out of the powder I put it on my face, rub it in, and then let it stay on the skin til it dries -- I make the bed while waiting. The product leaves your skin noticeably smoother and is a small pleasure to use. It is gentle but effective at smoothing the skin and improving its evenness. I do believe the results are cumulative, having used this for several months now. I still have half a bottle left and will repurchase."
3,A more traditional segue into post rock,"3 1/2Underappreciated band entry into this sub-genre does not break any new ground in the generally circular patterns listeners would expect, instead mixing the stretched out tendencies of Mogwai, distorted overload of Flying Saucer Attack, and melodic sensibilities of old Queens of the Stone Age and Smashing Pumpkins to solid effect. Whenever anything becomes too bogged down in it's own repetition Kinski knows just the trick to keep listeners involved, often capitalizing on the modest outing with spectacularly unassuming bursts of instrumental thrust made to specifically guide any given melody that sometimes remains just short of uninteresting. The total effect is one of dedicated overview, not nearly as immersed as many of post rock's most engaging masterpieces, but a far cry from third rate bands that sometimes infest this style."
1,Too Bad,"Great movies. Variable audio quality. Five out of ten DVD boxes in the shrink-wrapped package were EMPTY. No resolution through customer service because I waited too long. Let the buyer beware. As you can see with other reviews, I was not the only one to receive empty DVD boxes. These movies are available in other boxed sets. Hopefully, all the DVDs will be there."
3,Five Missing DVDs,"We received our collection on 8/18/09, and five of the DVDs were missing. There were plastic cases for all movies. However the cases for five of the movies were empty: Follow the Fleet, Shall We Dance, Swing Time, Top Hat and Barkleys of Broadway. We called Amazon, and they said that they were temporarily out of stock. We were told that they would escalate this matter and have the new stock checked before shipment to verify this problem didn't recur. This seems strange, as there are numerous other reviews from customers having the same problem months ago. We hope that the new stock does not have this same problem when Amazon eventually ships us a replacement."
5,Sensational!,"I will keep this fairly brief. I ordered this set with some trepidation, since other reviewers reported receiving it with 5 discs missing.I need not have worried, however, since it was absolutely intact and more luxurious than I envisaged. Each disc is in an individual slipcase with period style insert. There is a terrific documentary on the extra dvd, and you also get a CD with 10 songs from the original soundtracks. Not to mention facsimiles of some of the original publicity for the films.The transfers are amazing - I previously owned a British set of Swing Time/Flying Down to Rio/Vernon and Irene/The Gay Divorcee and the transfers were simply appalling. Each movie on the current set has been cleaned up superbly, especially considering that some of them are now over 70 years old!A word about the slipcase holding the set - very sturdy cardboard with great holographic imagery that will sparkle in your DVD collection!"
4,Astaire and Rogers Ultimate Collection,"These films leave you with songs in your head. Great mood lifters and wonderful dancing.One Disk was faulty .. Big shame. But it was still well worth the money. Astaire and Rogers were magic together.Feeling blue? Watch them dance ' Let's face the music and dance' and feel better!Glad that we are so much more aware or racists insults though. No more blacked , white faces singing. Thank heavens for that!Best to forgive them and be glad we've moved on!Love the set and the extras are good too."
2,I was super disappointed,"I bought this set because I am a fan of Astaire and Rogers and yes, all 10 DVD's were in the box. The problem -- The Barkleys of Broadway disc was flawed. The two most dramatic scenes in the movie were garbled. I have watched, and enjoyed all the other DVDs except The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle and they were all fine. I enjoyed the dance numbers in The Barkleys, but sure would like to know what happened in the missing scenes."
1,Why would you even go to this page?,decent graphics...ok game i played the demo about 4 or 5 times....would only pay about 19 bucks for the full version....gamplay is well..... ok...but sheesh it slides a little to much..no real control of the vehicles..good amount of variety..monster truck...jumps...bla bla...but never really gives you the feeling of racing...or for that matter driving a bug...i know it may not claim to be a sim..but hey..nowdays simulation is best...if i want cars that are defying gravity and when on mud it feels lick the slickest ice..i would buy a dang console ...i have a computer....graphics are ok..still feels cartoony like most all other games...we are along way from photo realizm....sound..well its ok..nothing spectacular....
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is just SO COOL. It is right onw with everything it says about me, my friends, my dog, my family, what I could do with my life and what I'm good at. Ive taken it to school a few times and everyone just wants to read about themselves!!!!!!!"
1,NOT like the old days!,"Well, my father-in-law bought Buckaroo for his third birthday at the endof October. Both myself and my wife remebered Buckaroo from our childhood and thought it would be a good present. How wrong we were. Any one of the three sensitivity setings results in the mule bucking at the merest hint of the saddle being put on, let alone any of the items. If Hasbro have any respect for its customers, they'll get this problem sorted and swap the mules over. It definately wasn't this rubbish with the original less complicated 1970s version."
3,"great idea, just doesn't work","I bought this for my son when he was 3. It is such a fun game, makes us all giggle. After about 8-10 times of playing, though, it quit working correctly. The hind end of the donkey will not stay down at all now. I really hate that it wore out so quickly, as we did love it. If they ever fix that problem I'll buy it again."
1,If 0 were a rating...,"this Buckaroo toy would have the big goose egg for a rating. I laughed when I saw the ""stinkaroo"" comment in another review, because I was thinking the same thing when it was such a huge disappointment in our house. Everyone is right: the saddle doesn't stay on, and we put every piece of the toy together it still doesn't buck. This toy is a major drag. I was really bummed when I ran across the receipt tonight and realized it was almost $20. It's a total waste of cash."
5,A good toy for teaching old fashioned values,"I love to get this game out when it's a rainy day and the children and I are close to getting cabin fever from boredom.We all love it for us bring families together in the best kind of way, to have fun and to spend quality time together. It's not hugley sturdy and the peices and action are not suitable for very small children but it is hugely fun!My children are more enclined to say ""do you remember the time we played buckaroo that rainy Saturday?"", which leads to, ""let's do it again!"" Rather than, ""I'm bored!""."
2,Difficult to understand,"I confess that I really do not understand what Walker is trying to say in this book. It is the kind of work that should be read only after reading an Introduction by a literary scholar. What is the Temple of My Familiar? At one point there is a reference to a ""familiar"" which is some kind of bird. The bird is put in various confinements and breaks out of each and finally flies away. Does the bird represent humanity, African-Americans, or what? There is no real plot to the book, just a series of stories about three couples. In sum I do not think this is the kind of book the ordinary reader can enjoy, but rather needs to be read as a literary study or in a literature course."
3,Night and day,"First half of the book focused too much on the geographical and historical background of Severus' hometown, Lepcis Magna. But the second half got into the details of Severus' life (finally), and that made the book so much more enjoyable. Birley could use clearer language at times, but the thoroughness of his research shines through."
4,Not ergonomic,"I just bought this thing at a computer store because I was looking for a cool CD holder for my car, and I was tired of looking, so I settled for this. I love the idea that the sleeves are removable. I only put one CD in each sleeve and a page of songs on the back, so I can add more sleeves to hold closer to the maximum of 22 CD's. The finish is less that I had hoped for... it is painted silver, not aluminum. The case opens up to about 87 degrees, contrary to what one reviewer said. The only major gripe I have with it is that the CD's sit so low in the case (especially the latter ones in the case) that you have to lift the CD sleeve with one hand and remove the CD with the other so you don't scratch your CD by pulling it across the edge of the case. The bubble sleeves look like they will never scratch the CD's. Overall very handy for my needs. I am going to buy the oak home CD holder so I can store all my CD's at home, and cycle CD's in and out of my car holder when I feel like it."
1,Dissapointing!,"When I first saw the commercial, I thought it was going to be really good. Then I saw the show and it was a shame. It's just a cheap imatation of Kenan and Kel. Except they have better morals, they don't have an ugly guy on the show who cannot sing.The producers act like since Drake is cute (yeah, right) he'll always do better than is clumsy stepbrother. They have all these annoying assumptions that get on my nerves. Also, I hate the way Megan always gets away with things, too.The storylines are bad. The characters are bad and not funny. The voices are bad. Don't buy the DVD."
4,Teacher's Delight,"Finally, help in getting children to comprehending and enjoy the art of Old English Ballads and the historical value of the storyteller."
2,Product GREAT shipping a disaster,The color of the pens is better than ever so the product I can highly recommendBUT THE SHIPPING IS THE WORST.It arrived poorly packed in a thin box with half a dozen pens broken.Smashed and useless.
5,up with plain yellow - down with fluorescents !!,"many years ago, the yellow highlighter was introduced and it hasserved us well - then, as often happens, people wanted varietyand pizzazz so they introduced fluorescent highlighters - thiswould be ok but they then essentially dropped plain yellow tothe point I now have to special order themthank goodness, they are still available (at least at this time)why can't we all leave well enough alone ?"
2,Orange and rather... Wet.,"I have some other sharpie highlighters that I love (these ones:Sharpie Accent Tank-Style Highlighters, 4 Fluorescent Yellow Highlighters (25164PP)), and I wish I had just bought more of those. I've been very disappointed with these highlighters. They are a very orange-y yellow, and not the traditional pure, bright yellow that I expect from a yellow highlighter. Also, they make the page really wet. Maybe the ink doesn't dry as fast, or it comes out more heavily, or something. I'm not sure what it is, but pages with heavy highlighting from these pens look wrinkled--almost water damaged. I would not buy these again."
1,Not Fluorescent - VERY DISPLEASED !!!,"I ordered a box of these from Amazon. These are dull pink, not Fluorescent at all. VERY DISPLEASED with this product."
5,Really good..,"I don't usually like what today's punk bands put out, it's all out of the same mold and pretty predictible. However The Deal are a breath of fresh air! This album is really good: They go back to the street roots of punk and bring great tracks full of sing-along. Get this now!"
5,Excellent quality with the design to match,"I bought this product (and the burp set) out of pure curiosity and I have to admit I was pleased to see it was beatiful and delicate item.The cotton is of excellent quality and it feels wonderful. Also, the packaging is great for sending the item as a gift.Definetely worth the money."
1,These ARE NOT FLUORESCENT GREEN !,"When Amazon and Sharpie say these are Fluorescent Green they are seriously misleading you. I gave it a 1-star because it was at least green.I know what fluorescent green looks like; I've used them for years to highlight my programs, but despite the labeling, they are just plain simple green... no bright, neon, leaps out at you green. And they are so dark they interfer with the underlieing text.First the marker makers stopped making true fluorescent ORANGE, a really useful marker, replacing it with something more a ""dull pumpkin"", now the fluorescent GREEN is going too?? BOO!!I'll be asking for a refund on these for sure."
2,Okay.,"This level is 1.75 inches wide. That's larger than I expected. The black printing on top is worn off a bit, right out of the package. The back side is hollowed out, so you need to touch the edges to have it work properly. It will probably get the job done. The manufacturer could pay better attention to the quality. Over priced for the quality."
1,THIS CD [IS BAD]!!!!!!!,This is a bad tribute to a diva! These mixes do not do her justice. I regret spending money on this!
4,Decent charger for fair price,I have had this charger for over a year. I just accidentally left it in a hotel room. Cord was a little short but nice for travel. Will replace with another one.
5,Great deal,"Got what I expected, shipping was fast, and it's been a few months and they still work well. No complaints."
3,Sharpie works OK!,The Sharpie product works as expected. The emphasis to imprtant passagers in written works has long been known to be useful.
3,well,I thought it just one than it arrvied with 12 pens .but when i hight line on the paper .not so good .hummmmmm
3,total body cardio,Warning look at item carefully Gaiam repackages of previously released dvd and sells with a new title but old recordings
2,What a waste of time.,"I really shouldn't have finished this book, but it was an audio and it worked while I was cleaning house. But it was truly painful at times to listen and I had to force myself to finish. Don't bother. A waste of time and money."
3,Unconvincing attempt at chick lit,"The heroine is a pathetic loser who falls in love with a guy who treats her badly. I found their romance completely unconvincing and the reader will soon say, ""Who cares?"""
5,Great read!!,"I just read The Big Love and it was wonderful! The characters were real and I like how Alison struggled about her Christian upbringing and modern life conflict. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under age and especially not for a young believer, but Sarah Dunn does make a case for those wanting to remain pure to do it for the right reasons.The book had me wondering what was going to happen through the whole thing. It was super funny and entertaining. I liked everything about her first book! Great job!!"
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"But I just couldn't get into it. The narrator rambles to no end, which got increasingly old. I found myself skipping her big long philosophical stories while trying to find the depth in this book. There really isn't any. I prefer more of a plot, more character development and just more of a story than one poor girl's incesant rambling. Blah."
2,Jennifer Weiner [...] - except not as good !,"This is the story of Alison who gets dumped by her boyfriend just before a dinner party to go back to his ex who he's had an affair with for months. This story was so disappointing: it's like Dunn took the same ideas as Jennifer Weiner's Good In Bed, i.e. being dumped, religion, pregnancy, friends, etc, but the end result is disappointing. The heroin is a girl who goes on and on about being an Evangelical Christian (who cares?), how she slept with few men, etc. This story is not realistic, it's not that funny, and the heroin is disappointing. If you want the real thing, read Jennifer Weiner, but not Dunn, sorry."
2,Predictable and not very convincing,"The heroine of this novel is supposed to have grown up as a fundamentalist Christian. I didn't believe that for a moment. Now she's a hip columnist in an alternative Philadelphia newspaper writing about her love life with Tom.Tom leaves a dinner party to buy some mustard and doesn't return. He's been humping a former lover for the past five months. Then Allison, our heroine, meets Henry, her new boss. Also hanging around is Matt, a colleague with a serious crush on her.So, will Allison find love with Tom, or Henry or Matt? Or perhaps none of the above.Since none of the characters was drawn convincingly I didn't care. Nor was I much amused by the author's various thoughts on life, love and the pursuit of happiness.If you like your fiction lite (and by that I mean very very lite) this might be for you.You want some meat and potatoes, try something else."
4,Not settling down for anything less,"I loved reading this book, which was funny, and romantic. The main character was easily sympathized when it came down to love troubles that are not controllable. It was inspiring in a sense, that nobody should settle down for anything less than what they want in love mainly. I would recommend it to my girlfriends, or anyone who knows the pain of breakups. Funny and clever!!"
3,GYPSY KINGS,"I have been a fan of the Gypsy Kings since their firstappearence on the scene as I found them both interesting and excitingas a relative new sound in Spanish/Latin American Dance Music.....Upon viewing this particular DVD that they performed in LondonI felt as though they were not as exciting as I expected them to be,however the audience that was there really got into the spirit of theevening and really enjoyed themselves....I have no complaints about the artistry of the group, but to me it lacked that extra zing that I expected......Sophie Bastas"
1,This band sucks.,This is the worst album I have ever owned. There isn't a single song on it that is worth listening to. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
2,Still waiting....,"Bought this, not from Amazon, but mail order and have used it for about three months. Still no permanent result. The hair is still coming back and it is time consuming. Now the professional electrolysis does work, which is quite painful, if you go about every three weeks for a few months, so until I see better results from this, I will give it the poor to fair rating."
1,sham product,do not buy. does not work. all it does is give you a tingling feeling. it doesn't burn or kill hair.
1,Its garbage,"I have tried this product, and it is a piece of junk. Really i wasted my money on it. This product is too mild for most of the people. You feel like notihng when using it, an i gues that is becasue the powere is not strong enough to burn thr hair root."
1,Mando,You have to use it 60 times to get results. How does the job on mens beard? Probably waist of time.
5,"Nice image quality, nice sound","Very good VCR.Pictures are quite clear. (I personally feel the VCR also sharps/clears the TV picture quality :) )Stereo quality is very good.Beautiful clock.The issue of 'It continues coasting for a couple of seconds before it finally stops during the fast forward/reversing' as seen above in other reviews is true and there, but for me I don't really care that. :)In addition, fast delivery by Amazon."
4,Great basic VCR,I purchased this VCR in order to tape a few TV shows when we are away from home. It is easy to use and makes decent recordings. I have 2 other machines that are DVD/VCR combos but just needed a basic VCR for one TV that has a built in DVD player. This fits the bill.
1,DONT BUY IT,"I purchased two of these on May 22, 2006. Both conked out, Kept coming up on screen I may need to clean the heads. First off its amonth old, secondly, I spent $8 on a head cleaner, and am having the exact same problem. Same thing, on both vcrs, which I think is kind of strange, actually. I tried to find Panasonic dealer to have them look at it, I put in my zip, and Texas kept coming up. (I live in NYC). I'm ready to throw them both in the garbage."
1,MORE CHINESE JUNK,"Eight months old, and it no longer records or plays back properly. I am convinced that every VCR out there today is nothing but junk. I have gone through three VCRs in the past 18 months. My first VCR when they first came out lasted 14 years! The fast forward and reverse are a joke. Can't stop the tape anywhere near where you want it to. In the past few weeks it no longer rewinds completely to the beginning, and programs recorded get extreme distortion and loud humming. Even a new tape does not help. Warranty is 1 year parts and 90 days labor. No one would return this for repair after 90 days and pay more for labor than the unit is worth. How do you find a decent VCR? I noticed Wal*Mart quit selling Sanyo VCRs. I went through two of these in less than a year."
2,There are better books out there,"Personally I did not care for this book. I not sure if it was Dan's style or what, but I have found the Apress .NET titles to be very good in whole. Maybe the book gets better, but I had to put it down after the first 250 pages."
2,Why do modern re-mastered tracks have to be so compressed?,"I have to turn down the music so that I can listen. The lack of any real dynamics has everything the same volume on every track. It is like on TV when the commercial comes on for every track blaring in your face only you don't go back to the regular programming, even on tracks that should be fairly soft."
3,Lanzar VX430 VX 4-Inch,I purchased this set as a replacement for a motorcycle stereo as the one that were in there have seen better days and too much rain. For the money these speakers are as described. RMS at 75 watts and perform as such. Bass is not good but if your expecting a four inch speaker to have such you will need to move up in size. I got what I paid for and happy with my purchase.
1,Hard to Use,"Although the steel case certainly provides an extra level of protection for your CDs, I found this product extremely difficult to use. The primary problem is that it doesn't lie flat when opened, which means that it is very difficult to browse through your collection of CDs. This also means that it takes two hands to put in or take out a CD -- one to hold open the page you are working with and the other to slide the CD in or out. Not a very good design.Unless you are planning on dropping bricks directly on your CD case, a soft-sided CD wallet like the TW-24 from Case Logic is much easier to use and probably provides 95% of the same protection."
3,Hmmm,"All I can say is that the ring is not like in the picture, but at this price you can't expect to receive something mega cool. I am somewhat pleased with the item except that it's not like in the picture, it has 4 stars, not 3, the symmetry is a little different but, whatever. I now want to buy another one like this because the first one I will give it to my girlfriend, I'll just have 0.5 size bigger and come back with another review, tnx."
4,needs new firmware to work with android,"Apparently they are still shipping v5.24 and according to the release notes the android bugs are fixed in v5.25, which you can't update to yourself and I was unable to find an installer who could update it for me. The only recourse is to send it back to parrot for a firmware update. I used the bluetooth file transfer app to work around the android bugs in the mean time. After that, it works great. I'll give it 4 stars cause it works great but you can't update the firmware without sending it back to the manufacturer."
3,parrot ck3000 review,"It is very practical onced installed and working. The setup is not so friendly since you dont have a menu, bt if you read the instructions well and hear the comands it is easy. For the price I think its a good product."
4,Parrot Hands-Free Car Phone,"Bought the Parrot Evolution kit for my wife as a birthday gift as our state had passed a non-cell-phone-use-while you're-driving-law. The installation by professional installers, who had recommended Parrot brand to begin with, was done within 3 hours and at a reasonable cost ($150). There is a learning curve to using the phone, and we have made unintentional dialings while just talking together in the car. However, it does work as advertised, and is a good value at Amazon's price."
2,Nothing Against Green Day,"I think Green Day is a fine band but this song is just not good. The song is just way too repetitive and it doesn't help that it is played every minute on the radio. Just buy ""American Idiot"" and skip this.LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY"
2,Not so hot...,"CDs fall out pretty easily after awhile; I would recommend CaseLogic holders over this product, they are more reliable."
2,VERY MINTY,"Purchased this tea thinking that it would be the same as Aveda's, but I was wrong! It was very minty and strong. If you are looking for Aveda's tea, don't be cheap and buy this, just go to Aveda."
4,From Sothern California,"Hi I'm from southern California. This book opened my eyes to a subtextual patern found in all of America's modern culture, that many more Christians need to at least consider. I'm praying for the success of this young author and hope that he gains the recognition his creativity and talent deserve. To everyone looking to hear from the wisdom of todays youth I endorse this wonderful writing."
4,"Great for learning coin values, not so great for teaching how to count money","This DVD did teach my 3-year-old all the coin values which was great. However, in order to actually count the money, the child will need to know not-so-basic addition (my child only knows basic addition). For example, the child might need to know 50 + 25 = 75. I can't really say it actually teaches counting money (although it does teach all the steps you need to take before you get there), especially for the younger ages...but I do think it is a worthwhile video."
1,Big disappointment,"None of the guys really sang anything. The banter was not even up to par for them. Willie did best, and his ""Too Sick to Pray"" was the best performance. What a pity. Could have been good."
3,Any theories on why they chopped out so much good stuff??,"seems like kind of a ripI may consider buying it, but for now amholding off due to the axing of ""Live Forever"" :-("
4,Love it with one exception,"This is a great product. It takes up so little room and is very versatile. I've had no problems changing the weights quickly with one exception. Since the 2 1/2 lb weights are ballasts inside, it takes too long for me to change them while watching an exercise dvd. Had I realized this, I would have initially purchased the set that ranges from 3 - 24 lbs each."
2,"Dumbbells are Not as described, flimsy only 10-50 lbs","I just received these dumbbells today. I am familiar with another powerblock set which I use every week with my trainer. My husband and I decided to get serious and purchased our own set.I was very disappointed that the pin seems very flimsy. It is hard to get in to the slots and I doubt it would last several months, or even weeks. The (smaller) 3-21lbs set I train with has a metal pin, this one is PLASTIC! The real problem, however, is that the item description is wrong. The weights run 10-50 lbs not 2.5 to 50 lbs!The dumbbells are clearly marked 10lbs and up... Not sure what the issue here is!!FYI, the 2.5 lb jumps are via two metal rods that you have to insert or remove to get the smaller jumps. Cumbersome and possibly a klutz accident waiting to happen. I'm a klutz- if I keep these, they will fall on my toe, no question.Buyer beware! NOT up to powerblock standards."
1,DVI IS NOT USED FOR COMPRESSION,"On page 22 at the top it speaks of a new video compression Digital Video Interface (DVI), that will compress video to a ratio of 150:1 and will store an hour length of video under a gigabyte.If you are wanting to learn the low level inner workings of an OS, skip this book."
4,4 for 2,"Asia's most popular work, and some of their best came on their first three cds, ASIA ( 5 stars), ALPHA (4), and ASTRA (3). They then released a best of cd, THEN AND NOW (3 1/2 stars), with 4 new songs. This new double disk combines all the songs from those 4 cds, onto 2 cds, plus 3 unreleased songs from that era. A better deal than buying all 4 cds seperate, and a lot more complete than THRN AND NOW. But their best deal is their Greatest Hits cd released last year, THE VERY BEST OF ASIA; HEAT OF THE MOMENT (1982-1990). Worth the money, and the remastering sounds great."
4,Works Well,Works well! I use this as a starter every once in a while and then use a bit of the fresh yoghurt for the next batch. A bit sour taste that can be helped with ~2 tea spoons of sugar to help the fermentation process.
1,Don't buy this alone,This product was supposed to be shipped along with other items I bought. But it was packaged seperately. It cost like $2 for the product and nearly $6 for shipping..Then when Ireturned it immediately after calling and telling them I was not wanting it shipped seperately and to keep it. They said it was too late it was on its way and to send it back for a refund. I did just that. Sent it right back that next day after it arrived in my mail box. I then see on my e-mail a note that they have refunded me the $2 for the product and NOT the $6 for the shipping and handlin. What a rip off. If they had just sent it with everything else they way they were supposed to......................
1,Makes a Yogurt Drink,"The first time I used this yogurt starter and it did not thicken I thought that it was my technique. After reading and making several sucessful batches using store bought yogurt for the starter, I tried another batch using the Rolmex starter purchased at the same time as the original failed starter. The results were the same: no thickening, just liquid.Others seem to have had good results so it is possible that the culture I received was not properly stored at some point before I received it or that it was just a bum lot."
1,Yogurt Was Too Thin,I decided too make my own yogurt to save money and I used one packet of yogurt cultures in whole milk. And this yogurt was too thin. Then I used Cultures For Health Bulgarian yogurt cultures and the yogurt was too thin. Bulgarian yogurt is thinner and more tart than many yogurts.
5,good starter,"This makes a good tart yogurt. I have used fresh yogurt from the store and also this packet and found that this packet made a firmer yogurt with a more tart flavor than using good quality fresh yogurt as a starter. Unfortunately, its expensive compared to just using fresh yogurt as a starter."
4,Pretty darn perfect,"Amazon was great. Recieved the product well before the anticipated delivery date -- and that was free shipping, nice. The bouncer was pretty easy to get together and put in the water. Recommend getting someone to help because its rather large. Wish that the bouncer would be a little ""springier"" but that was expected. The slide is key. The kids love it and its something that we'll be able to use for several years."
4,Do You Know Me?,"The story, Do You Know Me?, takes place in Africa where one brother living in a more modern community tries to help his older brother who has had to survive in the bush with only his wits to help him. Their ways of doing things clash and that's when the fun begins. Uncle Zeka and his antics had me laughing out loud! The characters in this story are ones you'll never forget. My favorite, Tapiwa, is a shy, intelligent girl who learns that the most valuable lessons are not always learned at school. This is an excellent book to read with your class, teachers!"
4,Looks low-budget but my 1.5 yr old loves it!,"I was not impressed with the quality of the film (pretty low-budget), but my 1.5 year old doesn't mind. It is a long movie (80 min) for a decent price and it has a repeat play feature to play the whole thing over and over without having to restart it (came in handy when I was on bedrest and couldn't change movies very often). The credits are really long though, and my kids get frustrated between Vol 1 and Vol 2 having to sit through all of the credits and worried the next part wasn't going to start."
4,Very cute!,"We purchased this poster for our son's nursery. It is very cute & looks great on the wall. My only minor complaint is that it has a white border around the image and I was unaware of that before I purchased it. The picture on the product description page can be a bit misleading; I thought it was an actual 16x20 print of the entire photograph since it's not shown as having a border. It looks fine up on the wall, it's just that the other 16x20 poster we have in the room is the full sized photograph of another animal. All in all though, it's a great product. Probably just my OCD kicking in.... :)"
2,out of time,I have no received the books. It's not the first time i have to wait for them.Please confirm me when i'm going to get the books.I hope a quick and favorable response.Thank you very much.Federico Marino.
3,Pales,"As a big fan of Blake I was surely disappointed that he's covering the same ground as in the past and covered it better in the past. The same relationships exist between the characters, their careers and their women as in Red Grass River. The action passages offer some bright spots (loved the prison break), but they appear between cliche scenes and his desire to show you he's done his homework on all things 1920's (the egg in the radiator, song titles, ginger jake etc.) but what bothers me most is this piece just doesn't seem to have any soul. Here's to hoping the next one has some."
3,wood toys,The toy was smaller than I expected. My son liked it anyway. The pieces are easy to break though. They need to be handled with care.
5,Priceless,"I bought this just before taking a trip to San Francisco and, because of my experience with the chowhound website, decided to eat solely at places listed in the book. Every single one of the restaurants we chose to go to because of this book was a gem in its own way. My girlfriend is now another disciple of chowhound as a result. Now I'm reading the New York edition to find more great restaurants in my hometown. Keep in mind that this book is a starting point for your research, unless you really know your way around the San Francisco Bay area. Otherwise, be prepared to look up locations and directions on the web."
5,yimster,"This is book written for people who have a passion for food by people who also have a real passion for food. These posters on Chowhound have dug up all the best places where you can get a great meal at a great price. This a work of love most of the hounds have no training as writers but only have a love for eating great food.I show off my book which I order from Amazon and three of my chowbuddies are ordering it. In fact one Lady like it so much that she tried to put in in her bag so she could read it in later. I had to demand it back.If you are interested in what the Bay Area has to offer in the way of great food, than this is a must have for you collection."
3,not what I expected,"This book is not what I expected, but that could be my fault.It is quite thin, and has trip suggestions in trains, boats etc.I didn't want to rate it, because I didn't read all of it, only took a glance to verify that I will have no use in it, since I was hiking in swiss.So the 3 stars are from walker point of view."
4,Fun read!,"I really enjoyed this book! It's a nice, quick read. I thought the characters were well developed and I enjoyed the paranormal story of Alaisdair and Viola as well. The only problem I have with the story is that I found the ending a little trite and weak. But, if you like romance / paranormal romance stories, I would definitely recommend this book. I'm about to order the next one. Enjoy!"
1,B-O-R-I-N-G!,"I could not get into this book at all...and I LOVE the paranormal romance genre. The characters were flat and uninteresting. The writing itself was okay, but there was no spark to hold my attention. I put it down after a hundred pages or so."
2,Repetitive and Ineffective,I love Marisa but was dissapointed by this video. The sections were repetitive and I felt like the video was very easy. I prefer to be challenged more.
4,Better than Average,"I liked the video. Good explanation of moves, maybe not as detailed as a newbie would want. Also, she did like 1000 crunches--this was almost impossible for me to keep up with. I am not a beginner but I am also not that far advanced yet. NO lower level moves were explained. I did the video last night and I am sore today.. so it just may work on toning. If is see improvement within a few weeks, I will come back and upgrade my rating..Update..I am back to increase my rating to 4 stars. I have been doing the dvd about 3 times a week and feel some improvement. I also really like the fact that you have a few choices for workouts. There is the full workout, the 10 minute version and a shapeup for legs that is my favorite now... I am not a man obsessed with Marisa so take my review for what it is worth..also, it is definitely a currently made dvd with Marisa as she looks now."
1,Very Disapointing,I have loved Scott Turow's previous books. This one is one of the worst books I've ever read cover to cover. It just got more tedious and less interesting as it went along. The ending was pitiful.
2,Difficult to get into.,"I found this book difficult to begin because it kept going between now and the past. This happened so often that it broke up the flow of the story and I had to keep reviewing to see who was who. However, it did improve somewhat after getting halfway through."
3,Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man?,"Can a Shakespeare gender-bending comedy ever work on film? Onstage one buys the convention that a gorgeous woman can convince everyone that she is really a he, but I've yet to see it work on film. Bryce Dallas Howard is talented and gorgeous, but it takes another kind of sex appeal to play Rosalind. It takes a woman who isn't afraid to convincingly play a man! Kate Hepburn could have pulled it off, or a young Emma Thompson, but Ms. Howard never even attempts to walk in a man's shoes. That spoils the fun, the dramatic (and sexual) tension, and the plausibility.As with every Branagh film, there's much to like: A brilliant opening that sets the stakes high, clear and specific actors' choices, gorgeous art design, yadda yadda, but frankly, I think Branagh was in love with his leading lady."
5,Clear Eyes and Full Hearts in a beautiful box set,"This box set is essentially a repackaging of the five individual season sets already on the market. In fact, the discs themselves look to be the exact same discs. Sadly, there aren't any new extras, which is a bit of a disappointment. However, the package itself is beautiful and features great, glossy photographs of all of your favorite FNL characters. Each page doubles as a sleeve for the 19 discs, which are then bound into a hardcover book and protected by a cardboard sleeve. Definitely a keepsake piece for true Friday Night Lights fans. Buy this and you'll have no regrets."
5,Great collection for a great show,"It is sad that this show had to end. It has one of the most realistic and moving plots (except that murder story line) ever made and the actors executed the characters emotions and conflicts perfectly. While the football scenes and shots eventually showed somewhat declining quality of play (but that's just me because I love the sport's hard hitting action) they really made the most of the sport's excitement and drama, balancing it with the more vital and important stories for the characters.I love how they've packaged all the seasons into one neat collection with stills from the shows greatest moments.This was bought for a friend, and even if I had the individual seasons already, I'd still buy this collected edition just because I want to have this as a big fan and admirer of the series."
5,Friday Night Lights,"One of the most realistic shows on TV. Can't understand why it was not a ratings winner. The actors were very good, perfect in their respective roles. A very good show but it's hard for me to understand ""football fever"", especially high school; college maybe. I know Texas does everything on a grand scale but here in Arkansas we get carried away with the Razorbacks"
5,This is beautiful!,"Oh my, this set is incredible! The way it's presented and the pictures inside are amazing!Just wish they released this exact set on blu ray :( Maybe they will soon - fingers crossed!"
4,rrobinson,"As a young man and not knowing much about Amiri Baraka,I walked away with vast knowledge of his life in the late 1960s and early 70s. This book does great justice to the impact Baraka had in the post-civil rights era in Newark. His plans, thoughts and energy are all detailed in this book. Anyone who has any intrest in Black Cutural Nationalism or an intrest in the post-civil rights era should pick up this book. Woodard describes the struggle and changing environment that Newark,NJ goes through as it changes socially and racially."
2,Pinzon 8-Piece Stainless Steel Steak Knives,"This is a very cheap set of steak knives, in a nice wooden box. But the knives themselves are ""cheap"". They don't slice very well, they feel ""cheap"" in your hands while holding them. If it wasn't for the fact that I had purchased these for a gift, and let the return date expire, I would have returned these. But the receipent of the gift was as dissatisfed with the knives as I was with this. Typical quality that comes out of ""China"", which was not disclosed in the description of the item before purchasing."
3,Piano Concertos Nos 1 and 2,It is not the concerto I wanted. However I believe the radio announcer gave the this title by mistake. It was just a comedy of errors.
5,I based my whole life on the doggy wisdom of Scuppers.,"Excellent illustrations and a wonderful story about this can-do dog named Scuppers. Great cozy scenes, adventure, rocking boats, ship wrecks, house building, everything you ever need. The best book of my childhood."
5,I love this story,"I chanced across this book one day and bought it for my (now 19-year-old) son, and it was so fun to read. We lost the book, but for years afterwards I always remembered the both the opening and closing lines: ""Born at sea in the teeth of a gale, the sailor was a dog."" ""And here he is where he wants to be, a sailor sailing the deep green sea."" It's just a darling story.Now I have a 3-year-old son again and I just had to buy him his own copy. It's one of the best bedtime stories ever :-)"
5,THE SAILOR DOG,"I read this story to my son while he was quite young. It was and still is his favorite childhood book. He is now 32, has sailed the western hemisphere from Puget Sound since the age of 18 choosing small, older craft that have classic lines. He is as resourceful and creative as Scuppers and knows what he wants from life. He has patterned his life of adventure and travel on this little guy, Scuppers The Salyor Dog, (his pronunciation). I can't imagine a better ""role model"" for a young boy or girl."
2,West is wonderful--the transfer terrible....,"I am a huge Mae West fan and collector of almost 3 decades (now that stung!) and this is a GREAT film. However....once again, nothing has been cleaned up or remastered. In fact, it is so grainy, I almost think the VHS release is better. This is good to have simply for the sake of ""preservation"" instead of relying on VHS, and because Mae West is always a total joy. But don't expect anything new or exciting, such as QUALITY. I'm pretty sure Universal has enough dough to have done a little something with this. Mae West's films are GEMS! They deserve the same treatment (to be cleaned up and have an excellent transfer), like so many great old films have when released on DVD. As it stands, no Mae West films have been remastered (with the exception of 'Myra Breckenridge').As I said before, with Mae West, you can't go wrong! But with Universal...well..."
3,FAIR,"This was pretty good, but not as good as I thought it may be. The main reason for this was that it doesn't have just non-stop and back-to-back dunk clips, it has to interview every player that does them. It would be nice if it were just like the FURIOUS FINISHES: bonus buzzerbeater feature, of course with dunks though."
2,Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots,"I just want to start by mentioning that I'm still incredibly impressed with the band for creating incredibly unique music after doing so for 20 years. It's always something strange with every new album and, for that matter, every live show. But honestly, I've never really been a huge Lips fan, and Yoshimi was no exception. The album begins with ""Fight Test,"" which is possibly my favorite song by the band, and soon after there's ""Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots, Pt. 1,"" but that's really all I could stay awake for. The rest of the album is just strange sounds and Wayne Coyne's tired, melancholy voice singing about robots and magicians and other strange things. I respect them for being weird and doing their own thing, but this album just wasn't for me. It seems to be the band's most popular album, so I still recommend that you give it a listen. Just don't blame me if you hate it."
5,Hyper-Amazing!,"This is an incredible album that is difficult to describe. It's like an intergalactic musical set in another time/place.Musically, it is an intriguing mix of rock and pop with a hint of electronica. Somewhere between Radiohead, Battlestar Galctica, The Power Puff Girls, and James Taylor.I give it four delicious stars for music and a final shooting star for the sheer originality of it.Definitely worth many listens and hopefully an inspiration for other artists to be more creative and break the musical mold."
4,Strange and Wonderful,"If you are in the mood for something very different than usual pop crap(like Avril Lavigne, Britney, or Justin), get this now!!! It's unique, strange, and brilliant! I discovered them for myself when I heard ""She Don't Use Jelly"" and bought this album after it came out. I was happy I did."
4,Completely Suprised!,"This record is really great. For someone that really never listened to the Flaming Lips before, I was very suprised by it. I knew them from ""She Don't Use Jelly"" but that was it. I decided to check this out because it was supposed to be great. All the hype is completely warranted. This is one of those albums that you really cannot describe or categorize properly. It reminds me in a way of Clinton's album ""Disco and the Halfway to Discontent."" I hope that people will discover this album because it is a gem."
3,Johnny Socko the musical,"Unless you're a science fiction nut, it doesn't take long for an album of songs about killer robots (pink robots, no less) to become unbearably irritating. The rock opera kicks off with ""Fight Test"", a song whose verses borrow (quite liberally) the melody from Cat Stevens' ""Father and Son"". ""Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Pt 1"" is very engaging musically, however once the chorus starts in, imploring the hero Yoshimi to prevent the robots from eating us, the song's impact is diminished. There are some decent moments here to be sure, but overall the effect is one of overkill."
2,Forget it.,New to the Flaming Lips. Don't waste your time with effort.Sounds like Neil Young in his Trans stage.
4,Midnight Snack,"Spinning this record around in the stereo is like crawling out of bed at exactly midnight, walking into the kitchen for a midnight snack and seeing a box of delicious candy sitting on the table. You don't know exactly how it got there or who brought it but damn it is good! A welcome treat! Ego tripping at the gates of hell is very similar to watching your favorite Sunday morning Sesame Street episode, but this time you're on acid. Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots part 2 is like being inside a colorful lava lamp. It is very enjoyable!"
4,best by far until War with mystics comes out,Ive never been a lips fan though i did like about half of the Soft Bulletin album. Yoshimi on the other hand is a very cool and consistent record. Do you realize is a perfect pop song though beyond the usual subject matter(death). I never get sick of repeated listens of this record though im not a fan of track 3 and 4. Not many records pass this test but this one does. It seems oddly invigorating despite being centered around themes of death and mortality. Alittle electronic-symphonic pop- pyschedelia-indie and rock make this the lips first classic atleast to me. But the forthcoming At war with the mystics comes out in a few weeks and i heard some great tracks on a preview show so they might even better this very essential addition to your cd collection. One small minor complaint at times the production sounds thin with all the electronic treatments and drum machines but thats about it.
5,Pinaud Clubman Vanilla After Shave Lotion - 6 Oz,"Everything is AOK. Pinaud Clubman Vanilla After Shave Lotion - 6 Oz arrived on time. I am pleased, I will reccommend this to anyone. I will do business with this company again. Thanks for your great service."
3,Arrived promptly,"so no complaints with the seller.As for the Pinaud itself---this is not the same scent they were selling as vanilla several years ago,which is what I had wanted."
4,"My second fav Pinaud scent, and my wife's fav","Can't say enough about the Clubman, but it is my love of Clubman that is the telling sign about the Vanilla.Vanilla is a strong 2nd for me, and my wife's favorite scent on my skin.I bought it on a lark - I like the scent of vanilla generally, and the price simply cannot be beat. Smells good on me, the Mrs. really likes it - what could be better?I'd give it 4.5 if possible, with the 5 reserved for Clubman."
2,bend,"I bought this set of knives, several years ago. They have not stained nor rusted. They have retained their sharpness to a decent degree. However, there is one problem. Although I always hand wash and dry them, the blades and tips bent with normal use. No, they did not fall on the floor."
5,Just what I needed,I received this product in just a few days and it was exactly what I ordered. No hassles and the price was right.
4,Maytag PuriClean Filter,"This is a good price and the shipping was free, making it a real bargain. I received it promptly, which is why I like Amazon."
2,not as pictured,I was sent a different item than described. I received the replacement product of the pictured product. Not bad however this those not have the great taste that was originally featured with the original purifier.
2,Refrigerator Water Filter,"I'm not so sure this is a good idea. I paid for my water to be analyzed and you cannot ask for better. What I've found is the refrigerator manufacturer put a time mechanism on my particular refrigerator that lights up at 6 month intervals, regularly and without fail. For the past 3 years I dated each cartridge I replaced and checked it against the ""replacement light"" that notifies you a change is needed. Living alone I do not use that much ice or filtered water from my refrigerator, therefore, the replacement light goes on EVERY SIX Months without fail and oddly enough I also get reminder emails from the company I purchased the filters from! Hum? What does this mean? Those cartridges are spendy."
3,check prices before you buy,I bought this filter for my Fridge and then found it for the same price at Lowes. Check prices before you buy online
5,Wonderful!,"This is a perfect workout video! I have a difficult time staying motivated in the exercise department. However, with this, even I can't justify not taking 10 minutes a day for a really great, balanced workout. I'd recommend this video to anybody who is either lazy like me or really just pressed for time."
2,An author you just want to smack in the head...,"It is hard to put one's finger on just what it is about this guy that is so damn annoying. Maybe it's the way he spouts off ""facts"" about Cuba that would appear to have been gleaned from Reader's Digest. Maybe it is the way he reminds one of that pesky ""authority"" sitting next to you on an international flight who deems it his responsibility to enlighten everyone else in coach. Or maybe it is just that he appears to be so damn american. Whatever it is, it is creepy. Pick it up at your library and give it a quick read some afternoon, but only after you have read works by more credible authors. There are scores out there with more credibility on this subject."
3,"lacks diagrams, pictures, etc.","Yes, this book contains much information about the different components of skiing, ie., balance, weight transfer, pressure control, etc. etc. It also contains a wealth of exercises/drills that allows one to improve every aspect of how they ski...Unfortunately, there are absolutely minimal pictures (cartoon drawings at best) to explain those concepts, and those exercises/drills..!! Yes, there are pictures - but they are mostly for posterity and not for supporting the words contained in the book.For a subject like ""Skiing,"" diagrams are a tremendous help, and this book has much to be desired on that area..."
5,Can I Get An Encore?,"I honestly can't believe this DVD has a mere 3 and a half stars. People writing in, ""This isn't music"", are obviously not hip-hop fans, which is why the number is sunk low. Jay-Z's ""Fade To Black"" was absolutely great. The Michael Jordan of rap retires. I'd like to see those people who are saying ""This isn't music"" go into a booth in 15 minutes and do your verses without pencil or paper, and do it in one take like he did. He's a genious. Get this DVD if you're a fan of Hip-Hop or Jay-Z."
5,Fade to Black,"Fade to Black to me is one of the best ever biographical movies. It deeply expresses amazing views,thoughts,and expressions of Jay Z's personal position on retiring. Far from being boring and dull, it brings life to how emotional and life changing events can affect ones decision on something as simple as retiring. To Jay it was more than that, it was like a thank you letter to all of the people, fans, whoever throughout his career helped him achieve his goal as a rapper. So to return the appreciation he searches for every element he can obtain to give back what we(people, fans) have gave to him. This movie is more than informative and interesting its like one of those good books you cant just put down! To me this is a must have. Thank you to Shawn Carter, Jay-Z, Young Hova, Iceberg Slim, etc.without you this would not be possible. Best rapper alive!SlongLenoir, NC"
2,Disappointed,"The blouse part of this costume was definitely not very flattering and it fit horribly- very tight and not adjustable (should have used elastic). Honestly, I am very surprised this was said to fit up to a size 12. I am a size 6 and it was very uncomfortable and did not fit correctly as an off the shoulder blouse."
1,neopren case,"don't waste your money on this one. the case is so tight that it holds all four buttons pressed, rendering player inoperative. garbage, very poor design. i returned it and got silicon one, i like that one...also, go and get the protective screen (palm or fellowes ""writeright"". you can't go wrong with thatcheers"
3,"Close, but no cigar...","I bought this unit based on brand and reviews on Amazon and Circuit City sites. I liked the quality - it plays regular movie titles fine and has excellent sound and picture. However, it would only play 1 of my home-made DVD-R+ disks. I am returning it. Meanwhile, I found a Sony that plays my home DVD's just fine (Sony DVD DVPNS50P/S)."
4,Easy to use,"This is a simple device with no bells or whistles. But, it functions correctly and provides the service for which it was designed."
5,Queens!,"Love this show, especially Arthur how he always seems to have the last word lol You've also gotta love Doug's taglines."
1,Ramayana: The Complete Series,"This is the 2001 series and not the Original TV version. It was all scatched up and I returned it. Does anyone know how to get the origianl TV version with the discourses that came with the TV series. Everyone one that I contacted keeps saying that theirs is the original TV version. Well they aren't I have about 10 of the original VHS tapes from the shows. They have wonderful discourses before the actual film of the movies on each tape. I can't seem to find anyone that has the complete series. IF you do please email me at okgodbaba@live.com I would like to see the original version, so much."
5,they don't make em like this anymore,"alfred hitchcock is one of the best suspense videos ever i have series 1,2 &3 and looking forward to 4,"
4,Laughter: A Serious Business,"Let me tell you, it was not easy in the old days.Hard to make a living. Acoustic bands criscrossed the country via train or bus, trying to perform, trying to get paid when they they did perform.Spike Jones was no exception to the rule. He always tried to keep things on a high plane [or bus], though, and brought his highly personal vision to everything he did.Ruthlessly inventive, and yet highly respectful of tradition, his personal genius produced this rare recording. Lovingly digitized, it's now available for the few listeners who, as my dziadz would say, ""know what's good.""I wish I could remember the original composer of ""Flight of the Bumblebee,"" but perhaps now it matters not. Spike Jones' redefinition of the work is all that needs to survive; the legacy of this timeless work now forever ingrained."
4,wierd but funny lens,"A strange thought provoking journey. If you think your life is weird, the characters in these short plays have you beat by a mile. A look at life through a different and funny lens."
1,Disappointing and Dangerous,"Xtra shelves appeared to be the answer to a dream--they attach to the corner, in seconds. No tools or hardware are required. I purchased several sets I planned to use them in my bathroom. I even bought extra Xtra shelves to give as Christmas gifts.When I opened the box, however, I found that the promise of magic turned to dismay. Each shelf attaches to the wall with A NAILHEAD, and TWO RAZOR-LIKE BLADES. These metal parts are flimsy, and may work in drywall, but they immediately bend when I try to use them in bathroom paneling.Also, they cannot be used in cabinetry, because they scratch the wood.I could not give them as Christmas gifts, because they cannot be used around children--the blades are too dangerous.They do not go anywhere.I do not recommend them!Thanks,JET"
2,Very low quality plastic,"I've used Avery binders before and liked them, so I don't know what the problem is with these. First of all I should at least note that the rings themselves work pretty well. The problem is that the plastic is very brittle. I ordered 3 of these and all 3 are falling apart. The clear plastic on the front of the binder cracked and split off two of them, and the plastic wrapping the cardboard backing is cracked and rapidly deteriorating on the bottom of all 3. Not sure if Amazon got some really old ones in stock or the quality was bad to begin with but I wouldn't buy these again."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting - because the description says a tulle skirt, but it is more sheer than I thought it would be. The picture makes the crib skirt look more pink than it truly is. The quality is fine, just not quite the color indicated in the photo."
3,granma,"The crib skirt is adorable! However, with the recent government recall on older crib models with drop down sides, the skirt is way too long for the new crib models sold now days. We decided to keep it since we like the ""puddled"" look. Really adds style to the nursery! Great pink color, unlike other reviews that claimed it was more violet colored???"
4,Simple to set up DVD player,"Purchased this DVD player for an elderly person, who never owned one previously. Plug and play (very quickly), didn't even have to read the directions! Progressive scan picture ensures very nice quality. Only negative is with the remote, as it only controls the DVD player functions, nothing on any other equipment (e.g., it would have been nice to have it control the volume on the TV). But, for the price, you can't really expect too many bells and whistles. Overall, a good functioning DVD player."
3,Okay for the price,I got the DVD-S29K to replace my DVD-RV27 because it lost its sound. The S29K does not have the picture clarity that the RV27 had. It is more grainy. I'll use it for a while.
1,Uncompatible DVD Player,"Unfortunately, I was led to believed this DVD Player was compatible for my TV. However, it was not. Therefore, I'm unable to use it making me unable to know how it will work. So, be sure to find out if this DVD Player is compatible with your TV, prior to buying it.The 1 star is based on fact I can't use the DVD Player, not on how it may work.Val"
5,Panasonic DVD-S29K DVD Player,"very happy uses a low amount of power both on and standby.Plays all my cd's and dvd's and has better video sigal to noise and audio s/n than any of the cheaper radio shack brands and others etc. Plays more media than others DVD+-R&RW; CD-R/W plus mp3&wma; and highmat2 files. this is a superior low price unit.this was my pick over sony, jvc, pioneer and samsung i looked into them all carefully. great picture and sound make this a best buy"
1,Charger,"Ordered one, battery would not charge. They sent another and it was busted. I canceled the order."
2,The Lady Doth Protest Too Much,"Although the book is carefully researched, the author still does not understand that historians' criteria when making their judgements are not those that the legal profession relies on. She repeats lengthy passages of Mauchly's testimony, which in her view are supposed to show us how duplicitous he was, but to me it seemed like a case of a poor old man being browbeaten and manipulated by a shrewd, high-priced, and unprincipled lawyer. Think of the movie ""The Caine Mutiny,"" where the captain, played by Humphrey Bogart, is humiliated by relentless questioning from the lawyer, played by Jose Ferrer. Mauchly was not a criminal and did not deserve to be treated that way."
4,Chill Out,"A great album for relaxing to. The music is well crafted and executed. The piano duet with Yukihiro Takahashi on ""Grasshoppers"" is especially good. Next time you're reading a good book, this album is a great musical accompaniment."
5,"Fabulous contents, shame about the cover!","At last, the eagerly awaited second series of Hart to Hart has hit the shelves. This series contains one of the classic episodes of the show, 'What Murder' where Jonathan loses his memory, forgets that he witnessed a murder and even forgets his precious Jennifer. Fabulous stuff.The quality of the transfers is good, not quite as clear as series one but an awful lot better than what most of us fans are used to!The two greatest disappointments are the appalling cover image and the lack of commentaries or featurettes. The covers of the 3 individual cases inside the box are much better, one in particular is a series two shot that should have been used for the box. But hey, it's the contents that counts and you don't get much better than this!Roll on series three and please Sony, we need a commentary on 'Hart of Darkness'!"
2,Islam Doctrine,"(From another's BRIEF review; posted just to give SOME idea about this book): ""This book contains 'the basic principles of Islam.' It is an exposition of Islamic teaching as it is understood by Muslims; it is not an apologetic treatise but rather a kind of textbook. It could be used in Islamic schools in the United States or Canada and it also could be used by anyone who wishes to acquire a basic knowledge of Islam in a manner presented by a Muslim, who believes in it."""
3,it a good,it was good a good move to watch don 't now what eles to say sorry it a good show to watch
1,Faulty product,"Bought three of these trying to find one that would receive a signal from XM. Tested inside and outside. Side by side to the Delphi equivalent, there is no comparison. Delphi product is far superior in sensitivity, or else all three of these units from Audiovox were faulty. The boombox apparently has some antenna or receiving section issues. Not worth the time and effort to even try another one out. The same Audiovox works fine in auto parked a few feet away from test of boombox, so it had to be all three boxes."
2,They SUCK,Looks good and worked good for a while..Then it quit!!I bought that CHEAP boom box from Amazon for $20 or soand it is 10 times better than Audiovox..Anyone need agood boat anchor?
3,"Not great, but works","A friend of mine had an older version of these 2.1 computer speakers and they rock! So I bought these expecting the same or perhaps better quality (newer technology and all). But these speakers are significantly less impressive. They are not bad, given the price, but they just don't sound great. The remote control is flimsy and hard to handle, the volume buttons are annoying (vs a turning control)."
5,Good Sound For The Money!,"I bought these to use with an inexpensive DVD player and TV in our bedroom. I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality sound for the money. Being the lazy sort, I wanted remote control and this system has this convenience. I am use to visual feedback with a remote, so I have to pay attention to perceive the differences as I push the remote buttons.With the concert DVD's I have viewed, the sound has been really good.The range of treble and bass adjustment seem limited. Loudness also requires a few pushes to make changes noticeable. But at the end of the movie, when I want to turn out the lights and go to sleep, a push of the button and the little blue LED goes out, telling me it is off. All-in-all a good system and suitable for a number of uses."
3,Mid range completely missing,"I spent a lot of time comparing speakers at CompUSA. The best sounding speaker that I heard was a Logitech 5.1 system and I have no need for a surround system. The best sounding 2.1 speakers was the Harmon Kardon sound sticks, but it's an old style that doesn't look right with my current Mac system. So, I ended up choosing this Altec Lansing. As soon as I set it up at home though, I instantly regretted it. The speakers have excellent bass, but that's pretty much all that can be heard. Even at low volumes, I found it overpowering and had to turn it down. The speakers are fine on the high end, but there doesn't seem to be much in the middle. I will probably end up returning these speakers and continue searching for something better."
4,excellent speakers for the price,"These are excellent speakers for your system, especially if you are running a good sound card."
2,Great item destroyed by shipping,"I ordered 6 of these chart tablets for another teacher and I to use in our classrooms. I had read a review that described effective shipping in a large box, so imagine my surprise when each tablet came in a separate bag. Every one of them was damaged because there was no support for the product. The covers were bent every which way and nearly all the pages were creased and mangled. The paper is usable, as a sloppy copy, but not for posting or keeping. What a disappointment."
5,THE UNDERWORLD INITIATION - RJ STEWART,"I READ THE ORIGINAL BOOK WHICH WAS SOLD OVER 10 YEARS AGO. THIS ONE HAS A DIFFERENT SUBTITLE AND PRINT DATE. HOWEVER, I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK HIGHLY TO ANYONE WHO IS PREPARED FOR ITS CONTENTS. THIS IS NOT A CHILDRENS'BOOK; IN MY OPINION, IT IS FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE HUMAN PSYCHE. READERS/PRACTIONERS OF THE CRAFT OF THE WISE - THIS IS A MUST READ! ONE MUST READ AND ABSORB WHAT R.J. STEWART HAS WRITTEN, FOR IT WILL DEFINITELY MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESSES. I CAN DESCRIBE PARTS OF THIS BOOK AS AN ELIXER FOR THE SOUL. WHEN ONE HAS EXPERIENCED THE 'DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL', AND EMERGED AS A STRONGER, WISER PERSON. I FEEL THIS IS A SHAMANIC TRANSFORMATION R.J. WALKS US THROUGH. THERE IS NO FLUFF HERE; IT IS FOR THE SERIOUS AND EDUCATED READER. TRULY A CLASSIC!"
3,It doesn't get much better than this!,"Thank you Steve King and Max Armstrong of WGN 720am radio in Chicago for turning me on to Big Bill Doggett. At roughly 4:53am in the morning Max comes on to do the farm report, and if the karma is right, Steve will play ""Honky Tonk"" (part 1).With the first notes of the guitar, Max will start drolling, and reminiscing about his youth back in Indiana when the carnivals or fairs would come to his town. Back then every carnival would have that special tent where inside ladies would disrobe, what we would call a ""tease show"" today. ""Honky Tonk"" would be one of those songs playing in the background. Doggett's music is what I would call ""grunt & grind"", perfect mood music (no singing) all instrumentials. If this CD doesn't take you back to the early, early 1950's, nothing will. Thanks again Steve & Max."
3,"A vulgar attempt to glorify the Ar.FL, which I have loved and reported on since 1987...","Jeff Foley talked a good bit andI remember him introing the bookon the Ar.FL halftime of a TNNgame (talking to the alltimehottest Football woman, JillArrington, son of ex-Phlliy back-up QB, Rick. Bring back Jill!).I was shocked at the vulgar languagein Foley's book! This is not suitablefor kids to read, in my opinion. It'sgood to see a book out there on thegreatest sports ever invented in thehistory of the universe (Thank youJim Foster, Ray Jauch, Mouse Davis!),but he could have cleaned it up! Andthat team is no longer around! Couldhave been a contender!"
3,"Good sounds, typical late 80's NY...","...sound, but engaging. Berg is an impressive, lively player, reminding this listener more of Michael Brecker than just about anyone else. Even the David Sanborn guest tune is quite good. The recording sparkles, and the album does a good job of showcasing Berg's considerable abilities.Personnel includes Don Grolnick(keys), Peter Erskine(drums), Mike Stern(guitar), and Will Lee(bass)."
1,I don't want to watch interviews,This is a sad release. This is how NOT to make a Little Feat DVD. Please just release the Austin City Limits performance instead.
1,a souvenir for Jamaica excusion?,"If this were a souvenir for their Jamaica excusion or a free extra DVD set for their brand-new CD, you might be pleased to have. But.....You'll watch a partial live concert includes only six tunes; Day At The Dog Races, Representing The Mambo, Pretty Good Love, Do What You Want, Cajun Girl and Dixie Chicken on this stuff. And luke-warm interviews.....oops. I've been a big fan of Little Feat and can say this will be a stain upon their career. I'm so sad."
3,"Some were fine, others were defective","I bought these to mail a standard size DVD case to about 130 people. The mailer folds around the case and seals with an adhesive strip. I did not have any complaints from people receiving the DVDs about damage during shipping. However, over 10% of the mailers I received were defective (13 out of 100). The smooth paper covering the adhesive strip on the defective mailers would not come off without ripping the adhesive strip off the mailer (ie ripping the cardboard of the mailer making it unusable). I had extra mailers, but I had already labeled the mailers before finding out they wouldn't work. It cost me not only the price of the mailers but also the extra time to label new mailers. I did not contact the seller, so I can't say anything about their response."
2,simple and flat,"The story is just okay. The real fault of the book is in its characters. All characters are flat and are never developed fully and as such it is difficult to relate to them and learn why they do what they do- a major disappointment since the story leands itself to explore the mind of a free willed woman. The author takes a very superficial and simplistic approach to the entire novel. All in all the book never came close to reaching its potential; however, I feel the author had no intention of ever doing so. Linda Fallon could take some pointers from Anne Rice and really make this a fun book to read and explore."
1,awful!!!!!,i thought that ann calloway would be just as good as liz calloway but i was sadly mistaken. whatever she was going for...she missed.
3,"Work well, except rounded bottoms don't lie flat for putting on toothpaste.","The toothbrushes are perfect size for little hands and we love that they are made from recycled plastic. They work fine for brushing. Hope Preserve modifies the design so they lie flat on the counter while squeezing toothpaste on them. The current design is rounded, so they roll to one side.Request for Amazon: can you please make your bundle colors of this product gender neutral? I had to give away 2 of the 6 toothbrushes because my son won't use pink ones. Silly, but a reality of having a little boy."
3,Time for something new,"Although Burke's witing is as stunningly beautiful as ever, he has exhausted the character of Dave Robicheaux. There's been nothing new in the last few entrants in the series; it's basically been the same plot with different characters. Even Cimarron Rose was really a Robicheaux novel; Burke just changed the setting and the protagonist's name. I hate to say anything negative, because I love Burke's writing. His early novels were excellent; it's time to write a different story."
2,good idea gone bad,"this movie was well thought out,with 2 glaring exceptions.the first being that the action sequences are either only on a computer screen behind the actual viewers or are so fast paced all you see are a flash from a knife or a fist or maybe a smeared,blur go by.was that a tattoo or bloodor what??not matrix fast,not jackie chan fast,not yoda fast....................blurry incoherent mess fast.the movie is ok throughout and only really gets good at the end.i admit too that i was suckered into watching this by the fact that wrestler stone cold steve austin was in it,but his acting abilities were horrid.good for a watch once,but save your meney and get it on ppv or go to the video rental place if you have to see it.otherwise,skip it!"
1,The Condemned should be condemned,"First of all STEVE AUSTIN looks through the whole film like he isn't happy doing this role,the plot stinks,no imagination what so ever! WWE films is trying very hard but the WWE cannot direct films. I love STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN but in this film,he's not very good at acting in it!"
1,Complete Horse manure,"this movie wasted my time. flat acting, dialogue, all very trite. The trailer was much better than the actual movie."
3,Could be better,"I bought this to do daily excercizing and the exercises are great. However, there is about 4 minutes of talking before starting the exercises and there is no interactive menu to skip this part and get straight to the exercises. Everyday, I have to fast forward through all the talking to get started with the exercises. If this DVD is ever re-done, please keep this in mind for persons who are actually using this on a daily basis and provide interactive menus so that we can choose the exercise session only."
4,Great pictures,If you love antique or vintage things this book is great. The stories and pictures in the book are so fun to look at. It also looks great out for Halloween time on the table. Everyone likes to look at it. Would recommend.
4,I want more,"I had low expectations for this single, but I was very surprised. Having a very complete collection of Enigma's singles, I'd put this near the top. Although simple in it'sarchitecture, it leaves you breathlessly awaiting the full albumpromised by year's end. Those that disapprove of this new material are probably only familiar with Cretu's work as Enigma, but he's been around many years before that entity and he has always had a unique sound. His releases starting withVoyageur (IMO) are returning to his earlier sound; frankly I love the path he's taking."
5,Absolutely Terrifying!!!,Doretta Johnson's protrayal of her experiences was absolutely mind-blowing. I had to stop reading the book for about a week because I was getting horrible nightmares. The things that happened to Ashley were terrible... I admire the Johnson's courage and applaud them for the strength. Especially Doretta Johnson. Please write another book!
4,A New Perspective,"This book was a page turner and I couldn't put it down. It was unknown to me that someone with pyschic tendencies and a background of cruelty affliction and abuse could actually be used by unseen forces to project supernatural phenomena. The house this family purchased was in a magnetic infested area because of power lines and had some major issue problems. Wow! I would have been just as overwhelmed and frustrated as Doretta was. I think when you read books with a supernatural theme, you need to be openminded and unjudgmental. Just because you've never experienced these kind of experiences doesn't mean they don't exist. I am glad I don't live in a haunted house after reading this book."
1,Description of product inaccurate,"This product is described as ""All-natural whole ""boiled"" oysters,"" and ""Harvested in Korea."" From the label it appears to be nothing of the sort. It turns out to be a product of China, a country whose food products I trust not and always avoid. Moreover, these oysters are farm-raised, not harvested. I did not like the taste and consider the quality to be poor. Don't waste your money."
1,Wrong description or...,"...intentional rip off?There is no 50 minute work out DVD included. The pump included does not work (after pumping air for 20 minutes straight doesn't even put a dent on the deflated ball) and becomes very hot after a while. I kept thinking the plastic pump is going to melt before the ball enflates (if ever). The ""65cm"" ball turns out to be only ""55cm.""I don't know... seems like a rip off to me, but amazon is not at fault, since the Nautlius web site has the exact same description for the item.Quality-wise, the TKO Cory Everson Fitness Ball 55cm I got a while back was so much better. The plastic isn't so sticky, and it felt a lot more durable than the Nautlius one, too."
4,Homestead Blessings are all excellent!,"I own several of these movies and haven't found one I didn't like. The West ladies encourage you to try the crafts, sewing or cooking offered. They are the type of women you would like to go home with and chat over a cup of herbal tea. Love these videos and they would make wonderful gifts."
1,Can't get the swings up!!,"I really can't review something I have not been able to use. The hooks are wider than the loops on the swing set. I have not been able to hang them up! I have to wait for my husband to widen the loops with pliers or something, I guess. I am not strong enough to widen them, and- just so you know- I also cannot get the safety loops at the swing itself closed. I tried a hammer and pliers but I do not have the strength. So maybe when my husband gets to it in 5-10 yrs like everything else I will be able to write a favorable review."
4,"Good swing, Great price",Good swing for the money. Terrible instructions. Chain is not as heavy duty as I would like but we'll see how it holds up.
3,Does not fit Chevy Truck Dash,"The speakers, PYLE PLRL462 4-Inchx 6-Inch 180 Watt Two-Way Speakers, will not fit the standard Chevrolet truck (1988-19923 and maybe other years) in the dash board mounting without modifying in the truck's dash speaker covers. The small speaker in the center is higher than the rest of the speaker by about half an inch.Nice that Amazon has a return policy."
2,Visual Typos 2005,"The book has a lot of useful information, but also has a lot of nuisance and killer typos--both in the text and in the code samples. If you are fairly new to programming, as I am, you will most likely not be able to get much of the code to execute successfully. Jump over to the author's ""world class"" book support Web site for answers and you will find readers trying to help readers...the author generally claims to be too busy elsewhere, or he will ""...check into it."" If you are new to programming or new to Vb2005, stay away from this book. We newbies rely on code examples that work as printed. This book doesn't succeed in that regard."
2,Foam Insoles,"I didn't like them at all, The measurement line they used for my shoe size was too small, and too slim for the insole of my shoe."
3,Lots of Good but...,"There is lots of good within this book including a focus on year round speed, annualized mileage and types of workouts. However, the book is lacking a lot of ""why"". Included is an annual program used by Ryan Hall but little explanation. More information is needed on how to progress workouts when building your own training plan. I like it but it isn't even close to the information found elsewhere. I'd rather spend the cash, for me, on the CoachRunning.com DVDs. Those are a much more complete look at training, include programs and can be applied to all skill levels."
4,Start Locally,"This movie was shocking in its day as it broke down cultural norms of the ""truth telling"" variety. In retrospect, the movie is merely funny but there is still a meaningful message here. Namely, stand up for your rights and don't be afraid to point out the hypocrisy of a corrupt system.For most of us the thought of traveling to Washington DC or our state capital is intimidating and inconvenient. Don't worry about that level. Start local. So says this endearing movie. Stella Johnson started with the local P.T.A. (Parents Taking Action) group. Find your local version of such as organization and get involved. You never know what good you may be able to accomplish."
3,"Nice music, crap voice","This is going to be a short but sweet review. The guy has some nice lyrics and music going on, but he just can't sing. Maybe if this music was written for a decent singer, it would be more famous and successful. But as it stands, it gets held back by his whining. Listen to the samples and you'll see what i mean.3 stars anyway for effort!"
5,Amazing,"Simply put this is the best live performance on DVD/Video ever. I won't admit to the number of times I've watched it since receiving it, but I will warn you that it's highly addictive! There is so much emotion in both Morrissey's performance and the audience's reactions. I last saw Morrissey live this year at the Universal Apmitheater and this DVD almost gives you a sense of being there. If you haven't seen Morrissey perform in the last 10 years, you're really in for a treat. He actually speaks to the audience between songs and he does have a sense of humor! My daughter, who hadn't seen him live since the disastrous UCLA concert in Nov of 1991, was amazed (she jokingly said that it must be someone else who looked like Morrissey) The extra footage of the MOVE festival is amazing. The audience is singing so loudly along with him that it becomes quite moving."
4,Question,"Morrissey performed ""No One Can Hold A Candle To You"" on the DVD. He claimed in the concert he was covering the song and quizzed the crowd after his performance as to who originally performed it. Does anyone know?"
2,Kind of cheap looking...,"I bought this as I was planning on purchasing the entire Corelle Simple Lines set. This tray showed up as a Quick Pick after I put the dishes in my shopping cart, so I bought it to save a dollar. However, after seeing this, I'm going to invest some more money and get some kind of dinnerware that looks and feels a little better. Something that is in a store so that I can touch and feel it.This tray looks and feels as though it is made of cheap plastic. Cheap Chinese plastic."
4,Good looking and sturdy,"Its a nice looking tray that goes well as a coordinate of the ""Simple Lines"" set. Also seems to be pretty sturdy."
4,comprehensive but not academic,"This is a wondeful book for giving the background in Zimbabwe of the Shona people and a pictographic essay of Zimbabwe which feeds into the Shona sculpture. However, this is not an academic study, not does it give comprehensive biographies of each major Shona sculptor. In its favor, it shows a closeness to the people and an understanding of their history and daily life. It also does have an extensive listing of sculptors which is helpful."
4,Organized and effective read,"Jeff has great points and cuts to the chase to get to what really matters. The style is excellent in that it is in the manner of a true salesman, and not flowered up with superficial sophistication. For the salesman, this is a great toolkit."
1,no view of deer bucktail colors,"I can find no place on this website to see the other colors of deer bucktail colors....can you please send me the site for the colors, I need a special chartreuse/yellow..."
5,"Works with Iwata siphon feeds, too.",I needed a color cup for my Iwata Revolution HP-SAR to convert from bottle feed to cup feed - read somewhere that the Badger cups would work ... they do. This 350 cup was a perfect fit for the Iwata. The cup's quality is outstanding as you would expect from Badger. The angled pipe allows you to adjust for level in different brush attitudes. I'm pleased with the purchase.
5,KWIK PIK Bags are great,"Unfortunately, I understand that the company no longer is going to make this product. Its too bad because it worked great. I hope I will be able to get whoever has more of these."
4,He's Still Great....But there's a catch,"No matter how many times you watch these classic sketches, you'll still love it, But this is just a way for Comedy Central to make more money off someone who doesn't want nothing to do with themDON'T BUY THIS!!!If you do wanna buy it for your collection, get a used one. Don't let Comedy Central win."
1,"Listen to Dinu Lipatti's Chopin, it should help a lot!","Before one learns the 'meaning' of Chopin one better should learn to read the text correctly. Looks like Mr. Tropp did not master that technique yet. The magical ""Barcarolle"" sounds like a shipwreck in the ocean. Rough 'forte' playing with overwhelming pedaling and complete lack of style is a signature of this pianist. We have an advice for Mr. Tropp: listening to Dinu Lipatti might help."
4,A Comfortable Cozy,"Been in a blue funk since Agatha Christe's TV tales dropped off the air? Now's the chance to grab a hunk of an oh-so-trendy 1940's British mystery. Inspector Alleyn can track a crook through a whole room full of blue bloods and spot a stray fingerprint right under their champagne fogged noses. No butler is left unexamined, no effete cousin goes unnoticed. Yes, it's time to gather in the drawing room to see who really done it.Fans of a simpler, more elegant time will love this series. I know I do!"
2,Disappointingly bland performances.,"Ngaio Marsh's main cahracter of Inspector Alleyn was, in print, a fascinatingly complex personality in the mould of Dorothy L Sayers'Lord Peter Wimsey, if not quite as contrary. By contrast, Patrick Malahide manages to make Alleyn a bland, colourless person. Belinda Lang, whilst personifying Marsh's Agatha Troy to the extent that she was not beautiful, thus scoring at least one plus in the world of normally not very accurate translation from book to screen, also fails to make her the deep and principled character of literature."
4,Liked it,"I enjoyed the mix of Vietnamese veteran soldier vs the IRA. Lots of edge of seat page turning and excellent writing. I didn't give it five stars because I thought the reactions to some traumatic events were unrealistic to the point of being laughable. But once I turned the page and brought my rolling eyes back to the fine writing, I was once again involved."
1,Poor,What a waste of time. Poor plot. This just drags on and on. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
1,Unwatchable,"This is a really good movie. One the first Vietnam films to deal with the war in a realistic way. It was the best in this regard until Platoon.Unfortunately, this DVD release is perhaps the worst I've seen in recent years from a major studio. It is not widescreen and the transfer is fuzzy and the color palette limited. I agree with another reviewer. It's probably just a digital copy of the VHS version.An absolute disaster."
4,A Very Good War Movie.,"Burt Lancaster is true to form, he always seemed to move with the times. An honest view of things to come in Vietnam, has a real 60's cynical feel to it, but a 1978 movie it is, so well done for that. Without doubt one of the better Vietnam war movies."
2,"Average on basics, weak on prevention","My impression was a review of what I have heard from each therapist I've visited such as ice, stretch it, strengthen it. If I had never head that advice, I would find the book better than 2 stars."
5,The best Dreamweaver MX tutorial book I've ever read!,"I'm in the middle of the book and I must say that of all the 4 Dreamweaver MX tutotial books that I've bought this one is by far the best and the most effective of them all. It guides you step by step seeing to it that you understand each topic before moving on to the next that no matter how complex some topics are, they will appear so simple and basic, hence, very easy to comprehend. How I wish I've discovered this book earlier (before I bought those other books)for that would have saved me a lot of precious hours and cash in learning Dreamweaver MX. To the authors and publishers of Dreamweaver MX Hands-On Training, you really did a great job deserving of a 5 star rating!"
5,Excellent Book!!,"I will keep this short. I have been working in the Tech Sector for years, and now I felt it was time to start a small business and put up a website. I bought the Dreamweaver HOT book, along with some other HOT books.The content is excellent! It is the most straight forward manual I have ever read. The authors make sure you don't get lost with information. I am very pleased with this book. I have also purchased the Flash HOT book, and from now on, will get HOT books for any subject I may need to brush up with.It is worth the money. Also, there was a customer that stated not to buy this book, and just stick with the tutorials that come with Dreamweaver MX. BIG MISTAKE. Buy this book.. The tutorials only cover some of the content, and they are not good themselves. Buy this book. You will be pleased."
1,Very unconfortable to use,"These brushes are extremely uncomfortable to use. Take a look at any toothbrush and you'll notice that the head either has no angle or is angled toward the face when brushing. The Preserve brush does the complete opposite. The head of the toothbrush is angled back and away from the face when held. You need to compensate for this angle to bring the head to your teeth by uncomfortably bending your wrist more so than you would a normal brush. IMO, these brushes are unusable. And they definitely should not be used by anyone with any wrist conditions."
2,These are NOT ultra-soft by any means,"I was looking for extra soft toothbrushes, which are hard to find in stores. But these are more like medium-soft bristles and not good for my sensitive teeth and gums.On the positive side, it is good build quality and I like the angled handle."
3,Not Thrilled,"I will use it, but it is small, like made for a childs mouth. The angle is awkward. If it was made just a little bigger, I would probably be satisfied.I picked up a soft Safeway brand toothbrush that isn't bad, but it doesn't have enough bristles. Between the 2 of them, I'll get by.Don't know why this is such a challange to find a normal soft bristle, it's absolutely ridiculous."
4,Take a look at the picture...,"While I like this toy, I think you could put this together at home by robbing your first aid kit. The pharmacy has syringes for giving liquid medication. You can grab an Ace elastic bandage and some Band-Aids while there. Small empty and rinsed medicine bottles would suffice for the ones shown. I think the little green pills are choking hazards. Necco wafers look sort of like medicine and are bigger. Post-It notes and a pencil could be used for the prescriptions. Of the gifts out there, this is one I would give for another child."
2,Junk,The contents of the kit are nice (although much smaller than I expected). My sons play with it often enough. I was disappointed in the quality of the tin box. It arrived broken. One of the pins had slipped out and is impossible to put back in place. I rigged it so my son could use it but it easily dented and is pretty much useless. I love HABA and have never had a problem before. This was disappointing especially for what you pay for HABA toys.
3,Not Plant Based,Buyer beware. I was fooled by the title for this cook book. I should have known better as it is not written by Rip Esselstein. Few of the recipes meet the criteria of being plant based by the definition put forth in Engine 2 Diet. I bet I am not the only one out there who made this mistake. Copywrite for this book is 1995. Copywrite for Engine 2 Diet is 2009. My mistake.
1,do not buy this collection,"I got this collection of Abbot and Costello for Christmas. Only one movie on this collection worked. All the rest skipped, froze and did not play. Very Very bad recording quality!!! This was a gift and should have worked much better!!! Did no one ever view what they tried to record of this classic comedy team? What they have tried to sell here is total crap? The Best of Abbott & Costello collections are the Worst of them! Never order from this producer again... Got my refund..."
3,Good movies but disc scratched,"The movies themselves were good but one of the discs was scratched. In fact, it was scratched so badly that we couldn't even see the end of one of the movies. Neither of the discs was latched in the grooves in the DVD case and were just loose when we opened it up so we are guessing they got scratched that way."
4,okay,if you already like these guys you will like this. little kids will like them. a little more hammie than i had remembered. 3 stooger stuff.
4,Online video,"I own this video on DVD and enjoy the multiple volumes of Abbott and Costello movies, so being able to stream it when away from the house with extra curricular activities gives me something to look forward to. I look forward to purchasing many of the other Abbott and Costello movies as they become available, and anticipate closed captioning being available for all."
3,BEWARE MISSING FILMS,"This is another nice Universal compilation, but some units were shipped with missing films, specifically ""A&C; Meet Frankenstein"", and ""Mexican Hayride"".Disc no. 1 has ""Meet the Killer"", and ""In the Foreign Legion"" burned twice on both sides.Let's hope Universal corrects this - because this package is missing one of the films that prompted me to buy this."
2,Rain Barrel Leaks,"The rain barrel leaked from the moment I connected the hose to the outlet at the bottom of the barrel. In addition, it is impossible to clean the inside of the barrel because the dividers at the top of the barrel are permanent and don't allow entry of hands and arms and cleaning devices. The connecting hose is very cheap. Not worth the money. Would never buy another one."
4,Fantastic,"A classic voice on a set of well-arranged classic songs. Worth the price tag. Any fan of jazz vocalists will want this in their collection. It contains, among other gems, an arguably definitive version of ""The Folks That Live On the Hill"", and many more. Just too good to miss."
5,Excellent,"This is a wonderful movie - visually stunning, psychologically complex, layered with intriguing narrative nuance. I left the cinema needing time to reflect on and process what I had just watched - a deeply satisfying experience."
4,Robo Platoon,This is a great set.I first started building when i was 3.The robo platoon models are pretty flexible but they stay together easily altough sometimes the legs fall off but thats not so bad because they can be put on so easily.You can build around 6 models with this set.I bought this set almost the first day it came out on december 10th.
3,Nice addition,"This was a stocking stuffer for my son. He enjoyed making the robots but they ended up taken apart in the Lego bin very quickly. I am not sure how to rectify this situation. We pay a bit more for these unique sets but many of them simply don't have the lasting play value of others. The Star Wars sets have stayed together through years of play, as have the Batman sets, others just don't hold the same interest from my child. If you think they same will happen then it may be better just to get the big boxes of Lego's for the same price as this set."
2,Not so Glorious Angel,"I have read many of Johanna Lindey's books, and I particularly like the Malory series. But I found Glorious Angel to be a bit overdone. The heroine has five, yes five, men going crazy for her at the same time. And I use crazy in the literal term. The hero's jealousy is absolutely insane, and makes him come off as very shallow. And no woman in her right mind would put up with him! I end up feeling more sorry for Angela at the end, other than overjoyed. Honestly, I wish that she ended up with one of her other suiters!Glorious Angel is readable, but I suggest that you pick up one of Ms. Lindsey's other books. Try Love Me Forever, that one is GREAT!"
3,Another Good Hardy Boys Mystery,"This review concerns the original 1944 edition. A man with amnesia, a crazy pirate, a treasure buried on the Morton farm and a case of counterfeit coins all occupy Frank and Joe's time in this story. This book was fairly good. The mystery was interesting and there was a moderate amount of action. One thing that I liked about the book was that Chet Morton played a prominent role in the mystery after being just barely mentioned in many of the volumes immediately preceeding this one. This book isn't one of the best volumes, but it is still enjoyable reading."
1,ONLY ONE!?!?!?,Shame on me for not reading the reviews ahead of time. I too was fooled by the picture of four and thought I was getting all four colors/styles. What I bummer when I received a single lolly. They should change the picture so it is clear that you only get one!
2,"Great ""Pretend Play item'","I love the quality of Haba toys. These lollies are exactly as expected. I was fortunate to have received all (4) colors for the $2.51. Which I believe to be a great buy. After receiving these I will be placing an order of 3 more.( I suggest contacting the seller to confirm you are purchasing the set of 4). I intend to use these for grouping like items, teaching colors and counting as well as playing ""store"". The colors are vivid, the 3.5''size is perfect for little hands. My 17 month old loves placing them in diffrent containers. Very cute item with various purposes. ""Ordered more and received only 1 lolly for 2.51. Very disappointed, especially after receiving the correct amount first time around."
1,YOU WILL ONLY RECEIVE ONE!!!,"I agree that this listing is misleading! It looks as though you are getting a set of four lollypops when really you only receive one and it is awfully small. What's worse, I ordered three and they sent me two that match. I was aghast to only receive three instead of twelve but then they send two of the same. I am very unhappy with this purchase!"
3,Strong stuff,"I'm still on the fence with this tea. I've been drinking Lipton decaf iced tea blend & thought I'd change things up with a different decaf iced tea. This tea is really strong & so full of tannins, if I oversteep it, it's awful. It's almost a reddish color when it brews. It brews much faster than Lipton does, and using 2 bags for iced is almost too strong. It goes from good to too-strong in no time at all. I do like the bags they use, maybe that's why I'm getting it too strong, it def. brews faster with the style bags PG uses. I'm hoping this tea grows on me."
4,Great tea!,"P&G Tips is a excellent tea, we really enjoy it and it has a smooth mild flavor. My daughter especially likes the decaf as she is suposed to reduce her intact of caffiene."
4,really different,"My nephew's wife was talking about the movie The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and I saw it and bought it - though I haven't watched it yet. I discovered it was originally a book so I ordered it. Wow, what a different story. I had never read a story about the Holocaust written from the eyes of a child of one of the concentration camp workers. The boy befriends another child on the other side of the fence. Finally one day the boy finds a way to get under the fence and join his friend to spend the day with him. What happens next is jay dropping and I never saw it coming though looking back I should have. I will say no more as to not give away the end of the story. What a really different storyline.This book was a short, fast read. I liked it."
4,Interesting and well written,"I found this book a very interesting commentary on the emotions of the innocent who simply learn what they are told. The pointy of view was very effective. I was not a huge fan of the ending. I felt it was lacking. After readers have gone on this adventure with characters, they deserve more in the ending."
3,Good but nothing special,"Read for a school assignment. Not something that I would normally read, but it made the movie much more interesting"
2,Not As Good As Expected,"I found it to be extremely unreal and not at all meeting of expectations,which is to be expected from projects that seem so interesting in the first place.I was bored,and happy when I finially finished."
2,Good premise but bad style,"When buying this book I didn't know it wasn't written for adults. The style was clearly aimed at children and made the book less enjoyable for me (for as far as a book on this subject can be enjoyable).Because the story is so unrealistic (I don't think children in Auschwitz were able to sit by a fence every afternoon, Shmuell could have just walked out of the camp) I didn't get taken away by the story as much I would have liked to.The end sentence was also to obvious.I think the book would have been better if it had been written from an all knowing perspective."
4,"""We hope you never have to cross such a fence""","The blurb tells the expectant reader, after informing them that giving too many clues would spoil the reading of the book, and explaining only that they will go on a journey with Bruno who will sooner or later arrive at a fence.Thus I will also not give away more than that, but what an excellent idea and well executed too. Some have criticised the story for being unrealistic or unbelievable, but let us not forget that the subject mattter the story deals with itself is incredible, and yet the atrocities in it and worse have truly occurred in the history of our planet.As for the characterisation of Bruno, I believe that his innocence had to be exaggerated to achieve maximum impact, so one must allow for that artistic license.An easy and quick, but hard-hitting read.It worked for me."
5,Great Book!,"This was a great book! It revealed the true happenings of the holocaust. I wish it didn't end so sad but that's what happens in the holocaust. Anyways, best book ever!"
4,Not for 10 year olds,"The book is so moving and a tale well told. However, the author uses a child's psyche to tell it, which means the confusion and difficulty of understanding genocide. As a result, it left my child unclear as to what was meant by words and scenes that only someone who already knows the truth would understand."
5,Brilliant,"If you dont know much about WW2 and the camps, this book is for you. Through the eyes of a 9 year old boy we are eased into the disturbing, unbearable world of Auschwitz. This book, although very sad and upsetting, is beautifully witten. I will re-read this book many times."
3,Well-written but not really plausible,"It's a nice book which I enjoyed reading.Very well written, from the point of view of 9-year-old Bruno.But somehow I find it hard to believe that a 9 year old boy, son of a highly placed Nazi soldier, is totally oblivious to the war and to the hatred of Nazi Germans to the jews back then.When they move to 'Out-With' Bruno is tutored by a man who obviously is into the Aryan-pure race thing and I can imagine that that man would have indoctrinated the children into also hating jews. I doubt that kid could have been so naive, and actually befriend a jewish boy.It was also a bit weird that a 9 year old didn't know what Führer means or who the Führer is. Honestly, the boy didn't recognize Hitler??And its also a bit hard to believe that Schmuel would be willing to befriend the son of the man who is causing them so much pain.I know the author was trying to show how how pure and innocent kids can be. But somehow, they were just portrayed as naive and a bit stupid."
1,Where is it?,Christmas has come & gone and I haven't received this book that was to be a present. Don't promise delivery if it's not going to happen.
3,Boy with the striped pajamas CD,"I purchased this CD set to use in the classroom. On various places on all of the CDs, the reading stopped. On most of the CD discs, it would not read at least 2 chapters. I have never had this problem before and I was irritated that we had to have our reading time interrupted trying to figure out if and when the disc was going to start working again. The students and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the voice and thought he did a wonderful job! Now if the CD had worked properly!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This air purifier looks fancy but that's about it. I received mine about 2 months ago. I took it out of the box, read the instructions, then put the setting on 3. Man O man was this thing loud. I moved the setting down to 2, still loud. I then moved it down to 1, still abit loud but I couldnt move it down any further 1 being the lowest setting. So I let it ride at 1 and never touched the air cleaner again until 2 months later when I smelled a smoke smell and it cut off completely. My neighbor who is pretty good at fixing things couldnt get it going again. He came to the conclusion the size and high-tech casing makes the unit look expensivebut the motor inside is cheap."
1,Modern Pro EU propaganda,The Germans aren't such a bad lot once you go to bed with them. Occupation is really not so bad so long as one is reasonable and can see that Germans are people too. --- this PC clap trap could only have been made now. The WWII gerneration would have looked at this and spit blood.
4,Island at War,The video is well made as many English productions tend to be. The acting is also good.The only negative is that the subject matter is depressing - but we knew that going in.
3,"Better version called ""Classic: The Black Mongoose Edition""","The quality of this CD/cassette are ""iffy"" but there is a much higher quality version of these songs on a mixtape DJ Taz did with Makell Bird entitled ""Classic: The Black Mongoose Edition"". Also visit DJ Taz on facebook at [...] and on myspace at [...]."
2,FOR PROFESSIONAL DECORATORS/ ARTISTS ONLY!,"This book has some great ideas, but some of the cakes shown and described are actually character scenes, the base of which are the actual cakes, and the decorations are almost all sculptures made of fondant or marzipan. (I didn't even know what those were until lately.) Although I did admire Debbie Brown's talent and expertise, the techniques used and suggested were VERY intimidating. What ever happened to old fashioned butter cream frosting and decorator bags? I guess if you're into modeling clay, though, you could get some good ideas from this book."
2,Not good for envelopes,Bought the lower tray to print envelopes because we do 10-15 envelopes at a time. Tray worked well at first but now when envelopes print they come out so hot that it seals the seal on them. If you open the back door there are two little blue tabs that if you push them down you can print envelopes without them crinkling....our envelopes still crinkle. A litte disappointed because it would be REALLY nice to have a printer that you can have a spefic envelope drawer and not have any problems and I thought this was the one.
4,Great UPS for Structured Wiring Cabinets,"Would have been 5-stars if they had put 110 punch down blocks rather than RJ45s for at least the phone lines. That was pretty dumb, but great product otherwise. Fits great inside structured-wiring cabinets, and pays for itself as it negates the need to purchase separate spike/surge protections. I did have to do an exchange with APC as the first one had a charging issue, but APC tech support was great and replaced it with no hassles."
2,"Could not configure properly, does not pass AppleTalk","I could not get this device to work properly in client mode, despite many years experience setting up wired and wireless networks. (My router is a D-Link Gamefuel wireless G.) It would frequently lose its settings for no apparent reason, and I'd be forced to reset the device to factory settings and start all over again. Also, it does not appear to support AppleTalk over wireless. This is the first purchase that I've returned to Amazon in 10 years."
1,Good for the money.,"I bought this in August'08. My company laptop has wireless disabled due to high security and I need to use the LAN cable to connect it to my VPN network. So, I bought this D_Link based on great reviews here. But I keep getting dropped connections every now and then and as a result I have to login to my VPN again and again.. I wish there was more frequent support for firmware updates or to the ability to use third party firmware like Tomato or DD-WRT.EDIT: I changed the DTIM to 1 and Beacon Interval to 50 and the client mode seems to work much better than before. I still get disconnected 2-3 times in a 8-10 hour day, but I'm okay with that. I would like to change my rating to 3 stars, but I cannot change now I guess."
5,Fantastic pocket router,"I bought this for one reason: to add my DirecTV DVR to my wireless network. It was pretty easy to setup. It works great. Doesn't take up a lot of space. And I love the convenience of being able to use it for travel as well, if I needed to."
1,Great little device right up 'till it DIED IN ITS SLEEP!,The unit will not reset to the factory defaults so really I have no idea if its actually dead or just faking it ... same result to my mind!
4,diffucult,i found the instructions a little unclear and had to fiddle around with it to figure out how it worked
5,I Love this little thing!,Its a life saver if you travel because some hotel buildings have terrible wifi connections in the room. I just plug this little guy into the wired internet connection and this thing sends out very strong personal Wifi signal to any comer of the room or balcony. I Love it!
5,Worth reading from Cover to Cover,"I normally only read technical books. I picked this book up just to look at the pictures. Then I started to read the short articles within the chapters. I found them so fasinating that I found myself reading the main articles. My son asked my wife ""what is Dad doing reading?"". Walt Disney said that it all started with a mouse, but after reading this book you will realize that it all started with a train."
3,Disappointed.,"This purchase was to replace my old Pyrex digital instant-read thermometer because my husband melted it.The new one works, but is much harder to read and the buttons are not as user-friendly."
4,quick and accurate,have used on turkey and prime rib. readings are fairly quick. nice to have the sleeve to store in kitchen drawer
2,Help Files - Version 2,"While this book did cover 3D studio Max's Fundamentals, like the title says. It was unfortunately a pretty dry read. There were too many boring pages between actual tutorials, which were pretty good when they finally came along. They were, however, not explained very well in the book. The Lotus ScreenCams that came on the CD showing exactly how the author did something is the only thing that kept me from tossing this book in the trash during a frustrating tutorial.The biggest problem I had with this book is that too much of it read like a help file. The author walked through too many of the menu's and toolbars explaining what their function was. The help files will tell you the same thing.More tutorials ""showing me how these menu's and toolbars are actually used in a 3DS project"" would have made this a winner. Oh well. Maybe next edition."
1,disappointed,It doesn't work! Very disappointing we were looking forward for this dvd helping my daughter learn her shapes and colors.
5,Straight Fire!,"Holy Culture was my introduction to Cross Movement and since hearing it, I have purchased every CD they released including the solo projects and their old albulms. I have to be honest in saying that I wasn't a big fan of Phanatik until I got this CD. What can I say, this is the hottest Christian Hip Hop CD I have ever heard. The beats, the ryhmes and the production are all of the highest quality. It forced me to go back and listen to some of Phanatik's other songs. After doing so, I would have to say that as a lyricist Phanatik is in my top five all-time of any hip hop genre. This CD is a must have for any fan of real hip hop."
4,great cd!,"i never thought that ""kill rock stars"" would get aband such as this... really [good] music it is one of those cd's thatnever leave your cd player! before work, before going out... anything, it always fits the mood! good buy, i love it!"
4,fun,"""Cute Boy Discount"" alone is worth the price of admission. Sure, they're not for everyone. You already know who you are and you know your musical tastes are different from the mainstream if you're even considering this cd. It's refreshing to think that they will always remain our little secret from the rest of the grossly pop-stuffed top 40 forty ditto heads."
3,"Great quality, but no room for a spare battery","This is a really top quality case, but it didn't have any room for an extra battery that I like to have with me, so I had to return it. Yeah, it didn't have a belt loop holder either. I didn't think I even wanted that, but once I got it, I realized how practical it was to have a case that fits onto your belt. If all you want is a simple, top-quality case for your DSC-N1, this one would be hard to beat."
4,A n amusing novel -study of people in the last century,The famous Swedish author August Strindberg gives a picture of different people living on an island in the archipelago in the end of the 19th century.He gives a portrait of a small island community and the society which includes both rich and poor. The main person is Madam Flood who tries to run a farm on her own since she became a widow. She has difficulties to manage the farmers until a new man arrives from the town.I think Strindberg's humour and his critics of the human behaviour is still valid when studying our own society today.
5,"Copland, etc. Vocal/Choral Music","This is a very interesting cd recorded by the Telarc team. It was a suggested review piece in a review for a famous European Electrostatic speaker manufacturer.I would listen to his on a system that is able to present a very large soundstage/field. Horn based (Avantgarde Duo) The vocal detail of the individual voices peeks from among the choral mass. I would say this is ""mood music"". It is not for everyday listening...I would also aver the guess that this would be suitable and more enjoyable over a system that has excellent pinpoint definition and excellent detailing abilities, front to back depth definition.Otherwise, it will sound like a mass of mush, warm mush, if you will.I would recommend it only, if it is musically your cup of tea."
3,A good place to start,"I found this book very useful as a teaching tool but it is often condescending to those outside of Indian Country, sometimes with good reason and sometimes out of anger. While the anger is understandable, the author looses her credibility by assuming all non-natives share incorrect views of natives. I still feel it is a useful book for demonstrating stereotypes and realities of the American Indian experience but, I wish the author would have moved beyond stereotyping readers outside of the American Indian as ignorant in order to present the realities of American Indians as valid."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"This was an inexpensive purchase and it did the job, but at the expensive of my hands being pinched. The constant up and down motion on this short length, with the hands together - for such a long time to fill my Thermabrand exercise ball - resulted in pain. In the future, I will use this as a backup to a better designed pump."
2,What a frustrating book!,"This book was our class text for a Flash class. The exercises were pretty easy to follow, but weren't helpful enough if you wanted to create your own site. Many graphics, movie clips, buttons, sound files helpfully added to the library for each exercise, but not a whole lot on creating your own. This seasoned-but-technologically-immature designer needed more meat!Too many erratum. Can you say proofreader?And, when it gets time for you to publish your movie, the book just pretty much falls apart and loses steam. Not nearly enough Actionscripting help for this newbie--help which would decrease the file size of my movie! And HOW do I plug it into my webpage??? Now I'm scrambling for other reference books to figure it out.Not a great reference afterwards, either. I don't know that I'd recommend."
3,"Only 3,100 pages","Brother claims you will get 7,000 pages on a cartridge. I only got 3,100 pages on my last cartridge, and most of what I print is text. I think Brother should provide a more honest estimate of what you're going to get."
4,so far so good,Item was received quickly with no hassles; seems to be working well; we'll need to see how long it lasts.
1,Dried toner delivered,I have used brother TN-580 from many years and never had any complaints but this time the toner delivered was all dried up. The very first page that I printed was faded.
1,Be careful.,"My printer was broken due to the cartridge I ordered. Although the price is competitive, it may be better to pay more to buy cartridges at real office items shops to avoide mechanical troubles."
3,Works great,"This works great with some modifications. I have learned to cover the little ""eyes"" at either end of the cartridge with a bit of sticky note paper so I can use all the toner (usually get about six more months of use at home). (Over time, a light that shoots through the two ""eyes"" will notice a declining toner level and eventually put a halt to printing --giving you a ""time to replace the toner"" message. BUT--there's usually still a lot of toner in the cartridge.--Brother designs the cartridges so they stop working (per the ""eyes"") way before they are really empty. I am dinging the product because of that design flaw (my guess it's intentional --in order to sell more product)."
1,NOT BROTHER BRAND ***** GENERIC JUNK,Not Brother Brand as advertised. Beware....the toner cartridge was not only the incorrect application but it was not a Brother Brand as the picture indicated.
1,This is not an Original Brother Cartridge. It is a refilled one so be careful,The advertisement stated that it is an orignal brother cartridge. They were most expensive compared to other refilled cartridges. But cheaper than he original brother cartridge. So I purchased with the understanding that it is an original brother cartridge. The package came in in an open box !!!!! I am tryin to return the package they are not accepting it. Very unethical and very dishonest people to deal with
2,Food Does Not Go Down the Drain!,"I can't stand this new drain gasket! Yes it is quiet, but it is so thick and the opening is so small that food will not just rinse into the disposal. I have to find a spoon or use my hand to push the food in so the water will drain from the sink. Yuck! Very inconvenient."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!,I originally purchased this phone October 2006 when I signed up with Verizon. The firt phone 325I lasted about 6 months with major enough issues that Verizon gave me an exchange. My second 325i cuts me of in the middle of converstions and does not hold a charge. Verizon tells me the battery is good forabout 8 months in this phone and is $40.00 to replace it. I am so frustrated with it I want to throw it out the window of a moving vehicle to fix its issues. Verzon will not admit to all if its problems. I have insurance on my phone but I do not want another one just like this one t replace it. I will purchase a different one out right to keep from having to deal with a third one just like this one.
1,They don't last a year,"Unlike the other reviewer, I had 4/4 go bad in a year, and this is using the PowerEx branded charger/battery conditioning device. They hold a charge for a time, but then the charger starts blinking red about the 3rd time you charge them, indicating something's wrong with the internal battery circuitry. Stay away. The Imedion from the same company may be better, but frankly, I wouldn't trust it. I just wish there were an Eneloop brand of 9v rechargeable."
5,A Look Behind The Raygun,"If you are a fan of Naked Raygun, this is a must have. it is loaded with concert footage and includes a full length CD of a concert done recently in Chicago. Being from Pittsburgh, I saw Raygun a few times and had all of the albums, but really knew nothing about the band or what happened when things fell apart. This DVD answers all the questions plus more."
5,Super retaining screwdriver,"I like well designed tools.In my youth I grew to hate Phillips and slotted screws and drivers because they would always 'strip out'.I now appreciate Klein, Snap-on, Wiha, Wera, PB-Swiss, Felo and more.The Felo M-Tec series is flat-out the best screw holding screwdriver (for steel screws).It uses a spring loaded circular magnet in a collar about the bit.This keeps the screw connected and in perfect alignment.The rest of the driver is quality materials and excellent tip design.Try one...you will be hooked!"
2,Such a fun DVD but ours was loaded with skips,"Too bad the quality of this DVD was so bad. It was loaded with skippps. We are exchanging it, hope the new one is better. Otherwise, what a terrific fun DVD for a dancing girl."
5,high school musical 2,"wow! they did it again, disney, director, and the cast. all very talented. we are excited for ""#3""."
4,each one better than the last,"So many review, just wanted to add my ratings to the overall score.More of the same in HSM2 but better."
3,"Decent, or at Least Better than the first.","Not in the age demographic at all, this said I hated the first movie. It was too cookie cutter clean, and not all that realistic in it's portrayal of the age range it depicted.However I know its Disney and who it was targeted for so I didn't really expect anything else. I just didn't like it.The sequel though, was much better of a movie, and the songs were much better. I wouldn't run out an tell everyone it was a must see, but I was a fun time.I don't understand a earlier comment/review talking about Zac's solo song and how it had backing vocals with him being the only one on screen.If you are going to go with that train of thought then there should also be NO music accompanying ever. That is unless you start singing at random moments in your life and there is also music too.If that be the case you probably need a bit more help than most.."
4,2nd high school musical effort,"I bought this to be able to see all 3 in sequence and follow the story line of musicals. Each movie can stand alone but the sequence of events will be omitted. Supposed time lapse occurs by seeing all 3. No. 1 and No. 2 are about a B value whereas No. 3 is A in my opinion. I enjoyed all 3 and have a very young granddaughter that will watch any of them. She loves to dance and sing with ""The Boys Are Back"" and ""Gotta Get It Together""."
4,HighSchoolMusical2,"The video was purchased for Our Grandchildren ages 5 & 7 for a Xmas present. First,it was orderedthe week before Xmas and We were apprehensive about it arriving on time. But it did right on the day promised and through regular courrier, not espensive at all. We have sinced watch the video with Our grand-children and We have all thoroughly enjoyed it. It's nice to be able to purchase products at great savings andin the convenience of Your Home.Thank YouPapadawg"
1,Invest in a real carport.,"The papers that come with this product state that the Shelterlogic warranty won't cover weather damage. What other kind of damage is there? Meteor damage?The frist heavy rain after erecting my canopy, one of the bars broke. It cost $20 to replace and arrived crushed. Another one failed today and there goes another $20. A metal carport of the same dimensions runs about $300. Something tells me I should have made the investment.Unless you live in Arizona or New Mexico or someplace else where it never rains, just bite the bullet and get a metal carport. Don't waste your time or money on this thing."
1,Do not buy this,"I have two cats with white faces and paws. They had a similar toy that they couldn't get enough of so I was pleased to find these. I brought them home and gave them a pink one. A moment later, I noticed pink stains on my hands. I checked the cats, and sure enough, their faces, paws, teeth and gums were stained pink. They were also ripping out and starting to eat chunks of the toy. The pompom was actually gummy with dye. The other colors were more color-safe, but were still too weak to hold up to teeth and claws. You'd think the designer never met a cat. I wasted my money; don't waste yours."
2,not what i thought it was,"based on the oprah recommendation i bought this, and also thinking it was more of a daily devotional or daily inspirational book. the readings were more abstract in some cases than what i am seeking. i'm looking for a more practical application."
4,Inspiring daily read,This is a deep spiritual(non-religious) book that makes you think about your daily life. It encourages you to be a better person and look at how you treat others. I was in a transition point in life wondering who I am. This book helped me answer my questions and guide me through tough and great points in life.
5,GOOD!!!,This book is well written and very thought provoking. It lives up to it's title.enjoy the daily prose and the suggestions to meditate on or ask yourself each day.Very nice and great gift!
5,Mark King Really is the King of Bass,"Mark was the bassist/vocalist/songwriter for the band Level 42. He is a masterful Bassist and extremely versatile musician. I bought this CD several years ago at its first US release and Ive about worn it out. If you enjoy upbeat jazzy music you cannot go wrong here. Mark plays Bass guitar, guitar, keyboards, percussion & drums on this album. The first track, ""The Essential is 18.5 min. long and exibits Marks versatile style and ability. Mark also has some of his Level 42 band-mates back him up on a few tracks. This CD is pure auditory heaven . You can't go wrong with this CD. There are'nt words to describe the way his music affects me. And if you like this, you will love Level 42 as well. I just ordered his New CD ""One Man"". I can't wait till it arrives. Enjoy."
4,Holux Gm-270 Ultra,The GPS works in both my Dell Axim X5 and in my HP Compaq nc6000 with a compact flash adapter card. I have used it with MS Streets and Trips and ArcPad.
1,Mad as a hatter,"Charles Duff's was obviously an inteligent man so why would he write such dribble. I felt the book could have been summed up in the first few pages, thank God there are few left in the world with beliefs like him."
5,Everyday Russian,"This is a fantastic book. While there are vulgarisms, the bulk of the entries are purely idiomatic and inoffensive. Many definitions contain English equivalents that would be baffling if translated literally. For instance the idiom for ""unkempt"" or ""slob"" is literally the Russian word ""scratched up"".One caveat for beginners; while the idiomatic words and phrases display accent marks, they are not shown above the surrounding words in sample sentences. A small quibble for an otherwise indispensable resource."
4,Houston's Best Kept Secret,"Hello, I live in the Houston area and I recently purchased a copy of ""Kill You Until You Die"". This group has a lot of humor and wit. If you are sick of all these corporate cookie bands, these guys are for you. What first got my attention is that I could not predict what the next song on the CD was going to sound like! Overlight Underdark seem to revel in variety; and while they change music genres often, everything still has a driving rock quality. And of course, several of the songs rock rather hard! But they also have some really quirky stuff that is hard to describe. This is the first Texas band I have heard in quite awhile that pulls off something unique. Songs I have been singing at work and in the shower since I got this CD are:I'M NOT ABEL , PRISONGATE , TRAVEL GAP HORIZON So to sum up, if you enjoy indie music and want something fun, witty, and completely unique, give ""Kill You Until You Die"" a try."
4,Can't beat MobileMe for simplicity...,"You may have heard that it's overpriced; that you can get virtually the same features for free by hobbling together offerings from other service providers such as Google, Flicker, and most recently Microsoft's Live services. And that claim might be true. But if you want straightforward email, webpace for displaying your pictures, home movies and creating websites, and the ability to easily sync your life across all of your iDevices, MobileMe cannot be beat for simplicity and integration with the applications that you already own (such as iMovie, iPhoto, and iWeb). Have your doubts? Try it out for free for 60 days and judge for yourself.[...]If you like what you get, then come back to Amazon to get the MobileMe package - at a price substantially less than anywhere else."
4,Works Fine,"Bought this just before .me came out, though Apple says the old .mac accounts will be moved over???Other wise, works fine"
1,I didn't like it,"I Think dot mac is buggy, slow, small, and way too expensive. And most importantly, when it comes to a web app, It's utterly unreliable. And for that, my friend, It isn't worth even the one star rating. Sorry. And I'm a mac fan and user (Imac AND a Macbook). But this just doesn't work."
4,Good price for .mac,"This arrived within just a few days. I was able to convert my trial account to a 1-year account... I like the price compared to Apple's own website and store price as well. I only wish they would increase the storage size and everything else for this price. I think it is still a bit too expensive for what it is. The integration with OSX is really nice, though, and I will probably renew again as long as I can get it for a discounted price."
3,So-so publication; useful for first-time language-learners,"Although I rate this publication as a ""so-so"" product, it is somewhat useful to first-time language-learners with no prior background in the Arabic language, which I have. Because of that background, I must disclose that this review of the book is skewed by comparisons with similar publications for self-study of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or the major regional dialects such as Iraqi, Egyptian, Eastern/Levantine, and Saudi/Gulf).The English transliteration system for Arabic text is awkward. The accompanying CD was OK and matched the lessons in the text. This would be much more useful and effective for self-study if the CD were updated to enable automatic speech recognition and provide active feedback to the user.Hope this helps."
2,Not as simple alone would hope...,"The content is difficult and doesn't appear to flow smoothly. I was lost in this book and never quite got it. Mind you, Italian for Dummies I found extremely helpful! Is it the language, Arabic, that's so confusing? Perhaps. Perhaps it is one that cannot be summed up in this format. Disappointing."
2,Arabic For Dummies,The author of Arabic For Dummies is very thorough and educated.My problem is that I need a teacher because Arabic is NOT for dummies.
2,Nuts & Bolts Windows Security,"Ms. Bragg knows her stuff. This book is a nuts & bolts approach to implementing security on a variety of Windows systems. The author's ""how-to"" instructions start with immediate steps to close the holes in Win systems and proceeds to cover all the bases from physical security to communications to PKI, security policies and more. This book is very inclusive and covers Win systems from 95 through 2003.The text is well laid out with plenty of screen shots, tables and explanations. The index makes this a fine reference book.The book does not get bogged down with a lot of superficial theory and speaks right to the heart of security issues."
3,Track List,1. Turn of the Tide2. Time and Again3. No Simple Cure4. Love Equation5. Secret Is Safe6. Landmarks7. Mere Mortals8. Mile Zero9. Actions Speak Louder
3,Accounting:A Question & Answer Workbook,"hello.... I want to buy that book, I don't know how to get that book. I hope you help me to sell and send me that book.In malaysia, we get many problem to find accounting's book. that's all zamiah yahaya"
4,"CRACKER, a readers comments","This book by Dana Ste.Claire is one of the better books on the origin of the term Cracker, It provides several theories for the origin, some more probable than others. The author paints a picture sensitively of the poor frontier person who has nothing and must make the land provide. The author does so without degrading the so called Cracker culture in the process. What the author failed to emphasize was that western frontier people had much in common with the Crackers of Florida. The book reads well in the recognition of the research that the author put into the development of the history of the Cracker culture. All in all a very good book for those of us who are affectionados of the historical and factional writings about Florida."
1,"Should not have the word ""lesson"" in it.","I wish I could get my money back. In the preview it shows him playing piano, and I thought this was going to be a half-hour instructional video. Instead, you get about 6 min. of him playing with an overhead view of his fingers, with sparse instruction. Most of it is just him laughing and going ""I think it's cool if you throw that third in there"" and then he plays it for a second and moves on to something else without even explaining. There are much better videos on youtube, explaining blues techniques. The other 20 or so min. of the video is just about him talking...and talking...and talking about the people he's played with. It shouldn't be called a lesson video, it should just be considered a ""Chuck Leavell Documentary""."
4,My Kitties Love This!!,"Nice little mice made of real fur. Just what my cats wanted! They love to bat them around and having the extra mice is good when they ""disappear"" under furniture. Definitely recommend!"
4,Its really good but not the Best,"I had just read Coming home (A must by the way) and the last shot Aunt may standing over a battered Peter had me gripped so I had to get this aswell. The drawings are vivid and great just what we have come to expect from Romita and the story is exciting, a real page turner. So why the not 5 stars? Well my big gripe with this story is the Shade who is spideys enemy at the end. It feels almost like Stracynski has just thought ""well the story can't be completely between May and Peter I'll just shove this guy in"" Which is a real shame. I personnally would suggest anyone buying Revelations should go for the the double and get Until The Stars Turn Cold with it. It helps to develop the story a little and has a great fight between Doc Ock and his counterpart. Revelations is very good but I'm glad I bought the double."
1,What's that smell?,"Worked great for about a month, then I came down to the computer and noticed that all to familiar smell of burning plastic and electronics! The Targus USB hub was almost on fire! I unplugged it and dropped it right away, it was HOT to the touch! BEWARE!"
1,Does not work with Win 7,"I Bought this from ebay, and was disappointed to learn it was not recognized by Win 7, just a warning"
5,Amazing,"This is by far one of the best books I have read on the faerie realm. Highly recommended from me, there is so much to take from this book I wouldn't know where to begin. A must have if you are seriously interested in the good people."
2,Not Worth It,The price is too good to be true. I barely began to use this ink cartridge before it ran out. I printed out maybe 25-30 sheets with it. Combined with the shipping costs this cheap alternative isn't worth it.
4,Good Text,"I bought this book for a class and only really had to use it for about two or three weeks. The text was easy enough to read although dry (but what textbook isn't). The photos were nice and it was cool to see examples of some of the things they were describing. I can't see reading this book for the sake of reading the book. It has good info but could have been presented in a more lively manner. I got the impression of a monotone from the text. It served it's purpose well, however, and I would recommend it to anyone studying this time period in school."
5,England during the dark ages.,Live again the history from the end of Roman rule to the Norman conquest. Very fun book to read with rich research and illustrations bring back this period of England during the Dark Ages. Read the Book. Buy the Book. A instant Classic.
1,sad,"I'm a truck driver and i get a lot of noise when i bought this at a truck stop it worked great until a month later when i needed batteries it takes 3 button batteries at quit the expense, the sad part is this is the only amp on the market i just want a rechargeable battery or AAA would be nice, the running cost is just too much I'm sorry to say i had to throw it away."
2,Works but with serious flaws,"This handset amplifier works fairly well, but has two serious flaws that can sometimes make it difficult to use. In order to extend battery life, the amplifier turns off after 10 seconds without a strong incoming signal to amplify. As others have commented, this is a nuisance when you are on hold (music on hold usually isn't enough sound to keep the amplifier on) or there are frequent pauses on the far side of the converation.The other flaw is that the specified batteries seem to have a limited life even if the amplifier isn't used often. The manufacturer specifies three AC675 zinc-air (air-activated) hearing-aid batteries. Perhaps these cells work best in a hearing aid, where they are used every day for hours at a time. I've found I have to replace the batteries in this amplifier about every six weeks."
3,Plantronics Headset Amplifier,"I have impaired hearing and use hearing aids.When using a headset with my cordless phone, the sound level is to low. This is particularly with headsets that have high impedance ear piece (such as in the range of 30 Ohms).With the Plantronics, the sound level is higher and can be adjusted up or down to suit my needs. The results are good.I do not like that the unit is suing zinc air batteries (No. 675). I believe that instead of the two zinc air batteries, it would have been much better if the battery was a Lithium type such as CR2045 which will have longer life.Mort"
1,Impractical,"An amplifier for cell and cordless phones is a great concept for noisy environments and for those hard of hearing, but due to the power conservation design of the product, it is impractical for use."
4,Plantronics MHA100 Headset Amplifier,"Used with Plantronics M214C Headset and cordless phone.Plus: Amplifies better than expected, small size makes it easy to move around, controls and indicators easy to access and use. An inexpensive solution for the occational work from home user.Negatives: Batteries not rechargeable, voice activated shutoff is annoying and shuts off while you are talking ... you don't know if the other person hears you, static when you turn up the volumn."
1,Loser music,"Do not dumb yourself down by even thinking for one friggin second that this guy is any kind of an artist, vocalist or songwriter. He is not a performer, and if you don't take my word for it fine, dumb yourself down and listen to this Emo heapo trash!! Look at his smug face on the cover, you really want him to be happy and have a successful career? Just awful music that makes no sense and has no place in the industry, ugh I have to hurl now that face looking back at me just makes me want to! I am ill to think even a zombie would be braindead enough to buy this but I would not put it past someone with a lobotomy there seems to be a lot of them buying Timberlake CD's as of this writing. Run away! Run away! And do not read Harry Potter do you not have any pride? Here, if you do have this in your possession then buy this 7-1/4IN 2-1/3HP CIRCULAR SAW and it should do the trick, just cut it up like a credit card and chuck it."
2,Nice but...,"Heavy, with a very fine mesh and nice finish. Unfortunately, the ring used to fasten the mesh to the handle has a tendency to fall off, along with the mesh. I push them back together and they hold for a few more uses.I purchased two of these on clearance at Bill $onoma for a couple of bucks each. Both have the same problem. Glad I didn't pay more."
3,EMI,"EMI this recording is difficult, I cannot discern if the conducting or playing is good. This my first encounter with this line of work. My first impression is that it is alike the Rite of Spring by Stravinsky. Good sound quality."
3,Well told story,"I have been a fan of Carol Higgins Clark since her first book. Fleeced is well told, but lacks the ""kick"" that her other books had. I had a tough time caring about who killed the two older men, because we really never meet anyone who really missed them. Also, lacking is Carol's excellent sence of humor which was evident in her best book so far, Snagged."
4,Worth The Read This Book Will Not Disappoint...,Talented writer Carol Higgins Clark has a winner on her hands with this wonderful story. I enjoyed the characters that came to life right before my eyes. That takes real talent to make a reader feel that way as they are reading the story. Super job.
3,Better than many,"Well written, well thought out, logical mystery. Charlotte Dodson is the housekeeper at Larchbanks, which has been rented to a mysterious Mr. Sigerson (does anyone not see what's coming?). Better than many, I actually preferred this one to Laurie R. King's Mary Russell series; Mrs. Dodson is a much more believable character. And while Holmes does appear to fall in love with her, nothing comes of it.One problem - the book is set in 1903. Moran has been in prison for fourteen years. 1903 - 14 = 1889. Ummm.... The Adventure of the Empty House, where Moran is arrested after trying to kill Holmes is set in 1894. How tough would that bit of research been?"
2,Not Great and Hard To Rate,"Pal Shazar was the vocalist for the band ""Slow Children"" back in the early '80s. Their self-titled album was very catchy and fun to listen to, but was never released (at least in the United States, to my knowledge) on CD. If I could have found it, I would have purchased it. However, in my quest to find that album, I came across ""The Morning After"" and decided to purchase it.If you look at the picture of Barbie on the cover of the album, you'll see how worn-out and wasted she looks. One has to wonder if that's how Pal Shazar was feeling when she put this album together. It lacks the enthusiasm and excitement of her efforts with ""Slow Children"" and is a very strange album.This album might be good for a die-hard fan, but for someone who expects a continuation of the saga known as ""Slow Children"", forget it. You'll be terribly disappointed..."
1,did not work in my printer,Thse cartridges did not work at all in my printer. I will never buy aftermarket ink cartridges again. I didn't realize that these were not original until they arrived. I thought I would give them a try. Never again.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Dorothy Yoshida is back, and again her telepathic abilities are part of someone's plots and plans. The war in the far flung reaches of space is won, but a bizarre and maybe crazy really old guy has a really large scale crazy idea of his own that he wants to carry out.Dorothy, along with a couple of others that he has along for the ride, must work out what to do about that, the alien knowledge she has, and a few other star-spanning issues."
2,Live,"A live performance that duplicates most of the songs on the album ""Touchstones"" but with superior instrumentation. Songs about the challenges of life. If you can only buy one, choose ""Touchstones"""
3,Best of the Myst Clones,"This game came the closest in rivaling Myst's amazing sense of aestetics and attention to detail..I also recall being impressed by all the movement animation that played in between clicks, thereby erasing that fake feeling of just magically floating from one hotspot to the next..Some of the puzzles are indeed, infuriating, but there is no shame in using a walkthrough when you have gotten to the point past fun and still have so much left of a beautiful alien world to explore.."
3,not created to win,This Game has the best graphics I have ever seen but it was not made to win. It is so complicated that without the book you are lost and even with the book you will reach a point that the book can't even help you. Not for the beginner!!!!!
4,Good port of a classic game,"Not many changes between the original game and the GBA port of it, but if you have never played the original, this is a good excuse to give it a shot! This game actually started me off on RPGs and is responsible for getting me hooked!"
5,"Just like the old Nintendo game, awesome!","If you played Final Fantasy on the regular Nintendo, then this game is for you. It is the same story line, but, with updated content. There are new/more monsters to battle, better weapons to get, better spells to learn and exciting new places to explore. I got it for Christmas with my Nintendo DS and have played it 3 or 4 hours almost every day!"
4,An Important Lesson,"As a diabettic of 23 years, I was glad to read Scott Bowles journals about his diabettes and his transplant. There is very little written about diabetes, even though it kills hundreds, maybe thousands of people every year. I understood exactly what he was talking about when he wrote about how hard it is to take very shot and watch everything you eat. I have reccommended the book to my friends and family. An excellent book, and something everyone should be familar with, even if they are not diabetic. a reader in Texas"
4,buy it,"i have wanted most of these movies for awhile. i wasn't HUGE fan of all the movies(looking at you electra and FF) even though i am a HUGE COMIC BOOK GEEK. i DO like the directors cut of DD alot better however.however at the price i could not help getting the set. PLUS it takes up alot less room on the self. you can always watch the less then stellar movies with friends and make jokes.i wish more companies would do boxsets like this. i LOVE slim case boxsets. it makes watching them easier than folding out a 9 foot long dvd string when you only want 1 disk.5 stars on the packaging and a cumulative 4 stars on the movies(sorry FF, electra)"
5,"Oh Daby, Give Us More....","This is music that is easy to fall in love with - be prepared to be pulled into melodic rythms by this wonderful new talent. There isn't a single bad track on this CD which is exceptional considering the amount of trashy material released today. Of course there are still favourites that stand out for me such as the hypnotic-chant-like quality of Iris & Kelimanta, Mansa with sweet woman's vocals peppered in, Hassina with a country flair with sitar as sliding guitar, and Fabe a lament to orphaned children. I find myself humming Iris or Kelimanta out of the blue - what a hook. Its difficult to judge the quality of his music from the too short samples here, but I guarantee this CD will be a keeper once you listen to it in full.As like the other reviewer, I do wish the liner notes included English translations to the lyrics because Daby's dedications to the songs reflects a beautiful, compassionate soul.Highly recommended. What Talent."
3,"Unfortunately just 3 stars, because there all old songs!","The title looked so good, and even a new song of Julien Clerc is called Rendez-vous with...which is by the way a very nice song. But it's not on this one, still all the oldies, which is a shame for a truly fan."
1,WTF,"i bought this game because i am an ICP fan and i was hoping they were going to improve dramatically on the first one. not only it this one just as bad, but i found the controls were even worse. i was very pissed that EIDOS decided to release this thing they called a game. i am sorry they used ICP's name to promote it. i love their music and the porn stars they used in this game, but this was just horrible. it was a piece of crap that wasn't even worth the 10 dollars i spent on it. sorry. don't waste your money on this. ICP fans should not promote this. i wish there was a decent game with them in it that i could give props to."
2,Short on detail,"Unfortunately, this clanbook, even at the time it was published, lacked detail and was not possessed of the highest production values - as Dragon magazine once put it, White Wolf took a long time passing Apprentice rank in the Sphere of Proofreading. However, it's not entirely without interest - still, if you're looking at this in 2003, you needn't even get it a second look, your dollars should go to Blood Magic (supreme!), House of Tremere (respectable), the new clanbook (not half bad), or Blood Sacrifice (unknown to me, but not really about Tremere)."
5,A Disturbing Look At The Justice League,"This DC Comics/Elseworlds graphic novel is a thorough tale of the JLI without Superman. Alan Davis did a excellent work making the established DC characters in their altered forms, like Green Arrow severely crippled, Hawkwoman(in a truly cool Hawk costume)now a widow, Robin and Batgirl murdered by the Joker in front of The Batman and Jimmy Olsen(Superman's Pal in the Current DCU)as the main villain. The Nail is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best JLI graphic novel I ever read in a while."
4,The nail : an Elseworlds tale of the Justice League of Ameri,"Super! This is the best DCU story ever since Kindom Come. The story ask the question what if Superman was not discovered bt the Kents? See what happens to other characters such as Lex Luthor, Lois Lane, Batman & the JLA if they haven't meet with Supes. Metropolis is a police state & the world is about to be invaded by an unknown alien enemy. The superheroes are not what you expect then to be nor are the supervillians.Alan Davis provides smooth and beautiful rendering of the DCU character and its like Crisis in Infinite Earths once again! Grab this book, you won't regret it!"
5,Roots,It was a good investment. The quality of the tapes was exceptional. The price was great. My highest recommendation.Thank you.
2,Poor Packaging,"This is a great story. I have watched it many times. It is great. I was glad to get all of these disks at one time. I was elated to get Roots and Roots 2 at the same time. We can't forget about what happened during those perilous times in our history. (And no, I am not related to the author nor have any connection with him. But if he ever wanted to give me his autograph, I would never turn it down.).Like other reviews, my score is not because of the story. I am not giving it a very high review because of the packaging. I couldn't believe when I opened the box, there were 7 DVDs just rubbing against each other and the DVDs almost looked used because of it. I could deal with about anything but that. The only, so called, protection to the discs, is the cardboard sleeves that don't hold the discs during transport.The other problem I had is that I couldn't get the captions to stay off on the original series. That was quite annoying."
5,A Must Have,"I saw Roots when I was a young girl. My mother made us watch the mini-series on television. Ever since she's always said she wanted to own a copy for herself and I bought it for her for Christmas. The price was pretty good since you're getting the mini-series, the show, and extra DVD commentary and stuff. My only problem is that I'm not a big fan of double sided DVDs and the actual Roots mini-series are all on double sided discs."
2,Don't Buy or Read This Book,"In the words of Frank McCourt, I don't ""give a fiddler's fart"" about his sex life. This book tries to be cute right up until Chapter 18 when Frank says, ""I'll try"" in answer to someone's suggestion that he should write a book.It's not amusing to make fun of students, their parents and other teachers. It's not good writing to use the same voices for all of his students over 30 years. It's not entertaining to stereotype everyone who crosses his path.What ""Teacher Man"" does is to cash in on the popularity of ""Angela's Ashes."" He blithely offends people right and left but gets away with it by playing the Irish card.This book is a disappointing bore out of what could have been an interesting look into what it is like to teach for 30 years in a city like New York, a city which deserved much better from him."
2,I was very disappointed!,"Up until this book I had a lot of respect for Mr. McCourt. I thought this book was going to be about the trials and tribulations of being a NYC teacher and how he overcame these obstacles in order to become an excellent teacher.Once I finished this book my main response was ""so what?"". It is boring, disorganized, and not really about teaching at all. He whines, whines, and whines some more and drifts from place to place without any real direction. I certainly know this is not uncommon but definately not worthy of a novel!Unfortunatly, Mr. McCourt wrote one outstanding book (Angela's Ashes) and has forced out his two sequels that are sub-par. Stop while you are ahead!"
2,Not much to it!,I've read and enjoyed Angela's Ashes and 'Tis. This book was such a disappointment. I thought it was just a wandering of the mind and not a very interesting wandering at that.
3,Real teacher ... real disappointment,The book was Ok. I was disppointed because I read it for the wrong reason. I thought the book would have alot of funny stories and inspire me to teach. But the book isn't about teaching. It seemed to be McCourt patting himself on the back for writing Angela's Ashes. I do agree it's a worthwhile read. And I definitely liked his honesty. But I would never call it a great book by any means.
5,Buy if you want to hate your CD collection,"Purchasing this album will be both the greatest thing you've ever done as well as the worst thing you've ever done. You will be awestruck, no... ear-f**ked by Herman Li's immaculately incredible guitar playing skills. You will be brought to tears as your ears are pleasantly raped by such sonic sounds that you have never had the pleasure of hearing before.However, after listening, as another reviewer stated below, all your other ""music"" will suck 10 times harder than it used to. This is especially bad for those people with incredibly poor musical taste! Anything that's not this CD is no good, and you will want to go back and listen to this.My two favorite tracks were Through The Fire And Flames and Cry For Eternity."
2,"Fast, but that's about it","If you have ever listened to them before, then you know they are fast. They truely have a great guitarist and a great drummer. The only bad part about them is they don't know when to slow down. I can honestly say I would listen to this band if they learned to slow down at some point. Speed doesn't make a good song, boys."
1,"Not a kid, just don't have my own Amazon account.","First off, to anyone who says that Dragonforce are reinventing metal or some utter-crap like that, throw away all your CDs, you do not deserve to listen to music.Now, I'm only going to say a few things about this CD.1. One of the worst CDs I've ever owned.2. Herman Li is NOT a God, they can't even play their music good.3. Valley of the Damned > Sonic Firestorm >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Inhuman Rampage.4. If you have this CD, I feel sorry for your CD collection."
2,They should be called StudioForce (or maybe DragonFarce),I fell for the hype and bought it. It was cool the 1st time then it was just noise. Very fast noise played well mind you but nothing to remember despite the press their getting. (What ever happen to The Darkness? Weren't THEY supposed to take the world by storm?)If you go see them in concert you'll see why some call them Studioforce. Not nearly that good live. Very messy. I'll stick to Dream Theater for my speed kick. At least they can reproduce live what they release.
1,truly bizarre,"why would you arrange and record drums this way? Clearly these are skillful musicians, but the aesthetic being applied here is unfathomable, at least to me. It's all going a little too fast."
2,Whoa there!,"Okay, before you cyber-lynch me, lemme just say this: these guys have talent. I mean, what you've heard is true, these guys play fast as hell. But super speed does not equal five stars, I'm afraid.Why am I not into Dragonforce? Simple: they are just way too theatrical and cheesy. It's overkill. It's just too much. It's like the birthday cake of metal: maybe good for a little bit, but you can't have more or else you may get a stomachache.I give it two stars because it does take talent and endurance to play at the speed they do; sorry, however, I can't say any more for it. Like I said, too theatrical and cheesy. I'd pass on it if I were you. But I'm not you. So I'll listen to good music while you give me a not helpful vote."
4,dragonforce,This review is written by Mr. Bradberry's students:dragonforce in human rampage is a mix of bands. if you like fast bands than this is the band for you. dragonforce sounds like they are serious but they are not. I think dragonforce is cool because of their fast playing and guitar playing. Its amazing how fast they can play. also I love the helloleenish keyboard and vocals. their music feels and sounds like its from hell itself like the song revolution deathsquard. this song has a fast beats and a killer solos. we think in human rampage is possibly the greatest metal bands of all time.
5,Really Bad Album: Update,"Not very great, many songs sound the same and Herman Li is overrated. Just listen to his cruddy betcha can't play this thing. He stinks.And the music is quite annoying."
5,Outstanding Technical treatment of UnixWare 7,"Technical information presented in laymen's terms. Great for Sys Admin's, software porting company's that are perparing for the 64 bit architecture IA-64 (merced). Provides good understanding of the operating system and how to get the most out of it. Recommend it for those taking the SCO Admin Course or ACE Certification."
4,Simple but reliable,"I am a system administrator. We have a radio station next door and wireless mice do not work reliably. The simplistic design results in fewer users complaints. Also the ""unisex"" form factor is good because we can use them left or right."
1,Microsoft Intellimouse is cheap Crap.,"I bought the microsoft intellimouse thinking it would not suffer from skiping, unfortunatley the one i got stops continuallyi think it just bad quality, i cant believeit doesent work when i payd ...US for it, I am going to return it and buy something which works."
4,Poweful and flexible mouse,I have three CAD operators who use these and love them for their flexibility. They use four different CAD programs and are able to program the mouse buttons to make their jobs easier in each program. The mouse seems fairly durable and holds up well under daily use.
5,Excellent mouse - bought another one!,Love the mouse so much that I have bought another one. Shame there isn't an cordless equivalent :)
1,Personal opinion abounds...,"A non-comprehensive philosophical dictionary which abounds with personal opinion regarding the defined topics. Instead of making an attempt at an objective definition of the words he has chosen, the author inserts much of his personal opinion, which can be quite pejorative. This is not helpful to the person attempting to shed light on a topic in order to develop their own point-of-view. There are also some poor translations from the original texts. Frankly very disappointing."
3,sound quality,"The constant sound of the strings as the guitar player changes chords, especially on the title track, is irritating and it is difficult for me to understand how a music company would release something like this. It ruins an otherwise beautiful cd."
2,"Very Big, Inconsistent Size","The ring is beautiful, however, it's huge. I wanted to wear it on my ring finger but I would suggest get it for your middle finger if you want it. Also the ring came in the wrong size. I ordered a 5 and it was a 5.5; someone had said their ring sizes run small - however, I found them to run big. But basically it seems there is no consistency with the ring sizes. I have bought several size 5 rings and never had a problem. I returned the ring and was not refunded my shipping even though the sizing was incorrect."
5,Great service,"Problem with UPS, the next day next i got a call with a quick response from Easy Traveler to correct it, Flask came the next day Great service."
1,Does NOT include paper,"This is only a software product. It does NOT include the paper needed to actually produce a bumper sticker. So, NOT everything you need to create a bumper sticker."
2,A Good Book for an Older Child,I bought this book for my daughter who is four. The little girl in the book introduces talking in a disrespectful manner and sleeping in parents' beds. Both were not high on my list for my little one. It would be funny if my daughter were older.
4,Better for adults than children,"I hesitate to give this book less than five stars because I really do appreciate good literature and Ruth Krauss. And any book with illustrations by Maurice Sendak is worth giving to a child.That said, the illustrations are the best part of the book. It is not Ruth Krauss' best. Don't get me wrong, I love creativity and the childlikeness of the poems included. But my kids didn't really get it. EVen though they are gentle and creative types, the poems appealed more to me than them. They couldn't catch the subtle sense of humor either.NOw my kids are young (4 and 6), so maybe they'll appreciate it more when they are older. And they did get some smiles out of the Song for Monkey. But I am not sure they were prepared for a new story each page, with very little connection throughout the book. Buy this for yourself and get the kids ""The Carrot Seed"" or something else."
1,This book was disapointing,"In this book I as a huge fan of Perry Farrell was hoping to learn about his life. This was more about the punk movement and music of Janes, Psi com, pornos etc... which is fine but then it shouldn't of been titled ""Perry Farrell"" Not to mention the author didn't even get his name right."
1,Cardboard Cutouts have more Personality,"the cover blurbs were more exciting reading than the actual book.This guy has learned all he knows about the world from watching TV dramas and spy movies.His women characters fall into three categories... helpless hapless ""blondes,"" would-be spies who are actually incapable of doing much more than walking down a fashion runway, and two dimensional power figures who are little more than ""yes-women.'The men don't fare much better. A 'president' who gives new definition to the term ""wooden."" Assorted Senators who waffle between power mad and power hungry. And then the redoubtable Mitch Rap, savior of the universe. I can almost see his cape. :-PIt's a shame because there actually WAS a story in there somewhere."
1,Flynn gets in touch with feminine feelings,"I enjoyed and recommended Vince Flynn's first 3 books even higher than I did Clancy's, Grisham's or Baldacci's. But this fourth book (Separation of Power) was a huge disappointment to me.Most of the book is wasted on how Mitch Rapp (the CIA action hero of the earlier books) and his useless girlfriend feel about each other. I want action - not a sensitive feelings book.There is no action until page 175 and then only about 10 pages thereafter. I will not buy Flynn's next book - I'll try it out instead at the library. I hope that Flynn returns to an action character like Mitch Rapp or equivalent and never again mentions the girlfriend. Reading this book was like reading one of my wife's ""sensitive feelings"" book or a Harlequin novel. Really disappointing."
3,"A Fair Read, But Very Predictable.","I read seperation of power in a week, I dusted it of my aunts shelf and thought""Well im already bored as hell, I got to at least trie to combat it""I read the first few pages, thought it seemed remotely interesting. But I found the writing to be stale and the plot fairly predictable. the characters were to action hero for me, I prefer nice and realistic chracters...which is something you will not find in this book. I also found me strongly disliking the C.I.A more then I already do, there even more ruthless then I had previously thought.I found my self wanting the supposed bad guy Hank Clark to achive his goal in the book. But this is just my opinion, if you do in fact like sabatoge and spie novels then im sure you would enjoy this, but if you like poetic wrting or un predicatable and suspenfull novels this is not for you, it tries to hard but just fails. But if you like I had said enjoy spie novels, then you might want to check this out,"
4,Good story,I have really grown found of Vince Flynn and his stories and the characters in them. I listen to them when I drive from one end of California to another and am never bored.
2,Nice mouse but lousy wheel,"I'm amazed at the reviews this device is getting. Yes, it is slickly designed, has a pretty icky red light at the back, and has flexible control software. But the wheel is seriously flawed. I bought one on Sunday and took it back on Monday. The wheel has far too much lost motion when it is pressed, sounds like a tin toy when it rotates (it is ANNOYINGLY noisy), and the tactile feedback is nasty. Pity, as otherwise it's a fine mouse. I actually tried several different displays in different shops and they all had the same feature, the trackball mouse is the same too so it must be the basic design and not a fault. My old Intellimouse did not have this problem. So I've now got a Logitech MX-500 and boy is this an improvement."
2,Disappointing,"I rented this to show to my class, who had read the story. After previewing the first 5 minutes, and decided not to show it to them. The original story was changed by having an older woman telling the story to her granddaughter as a memory, with flashbacks. This was an unfortunate addition that ruined the flow of the story, and the acting was not convincing. I do not recommend it."
5,daughter's favorite lovie!,"it's a perfect size and washes and dries well, so we love it, and it has been her favorite since she was very young (now 3). This is the third one we have purchased, in a panicked moment we couldn't find #1 and #2 so quickly hopped on Amazon to order #3. Of course quickly found #1 hours later and #2 reappeared a couple days later. Better safe than sorry, maybe one will go to live as a backup at Grandma's house."
3,A Text book for Conversation,"<Passages> is used as a text book in my foriegn language conversation class. This book has all-colored paper, so it is pretty expensive, I think. The construction of it is satisfiable. It holds lots of pictures, and I feel more comfortable rather than the book which has only words. But I can't ignore that <Passages> has boring parts. So, I say that this book is not perfect. <Passages> gives me some help to study English about pronouncing, etc."
5,"Smart, funny, ultimately uplifting!","This film is destined to be a Christmas classic. Mostly improvised, its a wry, funny and ultimately uplifting examination of ""Santologist"" Dr. Lloyd Darrow and his quest to prove the existence of Santa Claus. The real jewell of the film, though, is the interview footage of real children talking about their beliefs about Christmas and Santa. Shatner's narration is hilarious, and overall the film is just so satisfying. This would make a great, smart gift for someone who loves ""The Office"", ""This Is Spinal Tap"", ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"" and other parodies. A great film!"
1,"Stalking Santa, a waste of time and money","I'm a Christmas movie lover, but this movie is the worst excuse of a movie I have ever seen. It's just plan dumb! Poorly filmed and acted. Don't waste your money!"
4,An Excellent if Short Collection that Needs to be Reissued,"I have used this volume in teaching a class that explores issues of law, justice and morality in literature. The stories by Aichinger, Camus and Boll in particular are useful, and allow me to get the class quick feedback before we read a longer text. I agree with the other review that it could be longer, and if the editors could bring it out again with a few new stories, without making it unwieldy like a ""Norton Anthology"", I think it would be useful and successful. The goal is to keep it affordable and useful for teaching, and I have not found a single volume that contains these three stories that I want to use elsewhere."
2,Ludicrous points make text questionable,"Although material information in the book is in coherence with basic views of the realms addressed, I found certain ideas negative and foul. The equating of the cutting of flowers to the sexual mutilation of an animal is both scientifically insubstantial and ludicrous. It is mentioned several times in the text. I have the sense that the author has some issues to work through. As an individual searching with sensitivity and respect into the realm of nature spirits, I found his statements in this area to be ridiculous. The realm of vegetation and flower is indeed to be respected, but if we are to take the authors view that to cut a flower is equivalent to sexual mutilation, we must cease to eat broccoli, carrots, and any other fruit or vegetable, for these too are the children or reproductive organs of the plant. Lighten up."
3,mind of the poker pro.,"Nice dvd to watch on a rainy sunday afternoon. I was looking for some detailed information on no limit and this dvd provided basic simple information. Would have been better if they had focused on some of the hands more and gave some more detailed and explecit information. Some of the time it felt like they were competing for the mike to see who could give talk more which was distracting, but like I said it was a rainy Sunday afternoon and the dvd was a great way to spend the afternoon."
2,Didn't work for me...,"I'm pretty obsessed with growing my hair. I've been stuck at the same length for about 5 years, and I now realise that it's because i've been mistreating me hair, dying, blow drying and flat ironing... I would do just about anything for longer hair, which meant spending $50 on pills. Am I an idiot? Maybe. The pills after a month, had no real effect on my hair. For about the first week, my nails were growing, then stopped. Also, I saw no real change in my skin either. I honestly wonder if all these good reviews are real... Again, these are expensive. Just buy a bottle of Biotin (that's had actual results for some people) for like $8.00 to start off with. Hope this has been helpful.."
1,SLIPKNOT INSULT,"what is this?!Why does Slipknot need a tribute album? They have great songs, like WAIT AND BLEED and LEFT BEHIND,so why do they need other people to mess them up? The songs sound HORRIBLE!!!It's a good thing I could listen to all the songs on Napster, because I was thinking of getting it!-WHAT IS THIS?- =)"
3,Not same color as ad,"The shoe is really green, very much like a pale-ish olive green. It is not at all the nearly white shoe shown. It seemed like a hint of green/like wintergreen in the pic.Also, they were 1/2 size larger than the normal size-and your foot slides to the front, leaving a gap at the back regardless of the little strap that can't hold you back. So, if you order a 9.5 and wear a 10, you'll be okay. I wear an 8.5 & the 8.5 was large. I have a slightly wide foot & it fit okay there. It is an otherwise really nice, cute, semi-comfy shoe-not for the whole day or whole night dancing. I would give it 4 stars if they advertised the true color. 5 if the size was closer & if it were more comfortable."
5,Glorious,"If you love exuberant melody, you'll love this album. It's a pity this music isn't sung more often now. Schwarzkopf's voice is glorious, and the selection of pieces is terrific."
4,Like the see-though tray,"The see-through tray makes it easy for not only positioning/attaching the tray to the wheelchair, but also for seeing where your wheels and feet are positioned as you sit in the chair."
5,Best Deal,"I like thick, heavy glasses and these fit those criteria perfectly. Maybe they're not fashionable but these great for everyday use (or should I say abuse?). We've had these for almost a year now and haven't had any issues with any of them cracking or breaking. They're run through the dishwasher constantly and they're still looking just as clear as the day we bought them.I have yet to see a better deal on a set of glasses that comes near these ones in price."
5,"great set, great price!","Had been looking for rugged glassware for some time. These fill the bill, good for everyday and even some special occasions. With 10 glasses of each style included in the set, you get plenty of high quality glassware. While the prices quoted on Amazon are certainly fair, shop around. I found this set at Home Goods in Columbus OH for $16.99. Even after adding tax, the cost was about .60 per glass, a real bargain!"
2,Menuhin and the 1950's decline,"A friend lent me this cd, people keep buying Menuhin recordings from any date and mostly are dissappointed with his bad intonation, loss of livelyness and ""fire"". There is one simple rule if you want a menuhin recording that is great both musically and techinically : DO NOT BUY CD'S OF MENUHIN WHICH WERE RECORDED FROM 1950 ONWARDS! Unless you want a ""human"" ie ""menuhin's mistakes"" music. The techinical decline annoys me and it is too obvious to be dismissed."
5,He takes a profound subject and makes it simple,"This book came out in 1986, and my professors in college spoke highly of it and I finally sat down and read it in 2006 and it was great. What topic is more important than the gospel? What event is more important than the Cross? Like John Stott says, ""It was by his death that he wished above all else to be remembered."" Judas handed him over out of greed, The leaders handed him over out of envy, Pilate handed him over out of cowardice, and we also handed him over and shouted ""Crucify!"""
5,trivial pursuit,"This item has been fun. It was in shoddier shape than what I expected. However, it was used and guess I shouldn't have expected much."
1,More misses than hits,"I've been working in the IT field for 20 years, there are too many wrong answers in this book! In some cases the explanation for the answer shows that the editor or writer told you the wrong answer. How can you study and be sure you are getting the right answers for the upcoming tests? Don't get this."
4,Very good tool!,"I've had this tester for two years its performance has been flawless. Set it on super sensitive mode and you can trace live wires behind walls, very handy for re-models. Great tool!"
1,What a waste!,This e-book was a total waste - half the pages had blown-up type that filled space - and it was only 5 pages! There is the same exact information available on free sites on the web. Don't waste your 4 bucks.
2,Reads more like a research paper than anything practical,"It wasn't until the last half of the book that I got anything useful out of the book. The first half is very esoteric. Fine if you're deep into anthroposophy but if you are more interested in the practical applications of temperaments in your home, homeschool, or school, look elsewhere. The first half is mostly history, tracing from the Ancient Greeks to medieval times, while the second half is a little meatier with ways of identifying children's temperaments (remember, the whole point of the book) and ways to diminish or reinforce different aspects of a temperament. I'll be looking elsewhere for more practical aspects."
4,Good condition; exactly as advertised,"I bought this book because my parents had mentioned it to me a long time ago. My uncle, Charlie Exley, is the proofreader discussed in the book. He is not the ""Charley"" of the title, but several pages are devoted to his association with the department store. I am very glad that I bought the book."
5,"Great Light, better Customer service","I bought this light for my husband as a gift to use around the house. We both love the light, it is the best that we have bought. It is amazing how clear and far the light shines with just 3 AAA's. But the best thing is that one of the kids dropped the light and broke the lens in it. I called the customer service number on the box, expecting to shell out some money to buy a replacement. The wonderful lady on the phone didn't even ask what happened she just asked for my address and a couple of days later a new lens was in the mail. It turned out to be the wrong sized one. So I called the wonderful customer service lady again, and this time they sent the whole top part of the flash light to replace it. Not one question asked. I am so amazed! They were such a great company to deal with. I have been looking for more of their products just because of the service."
3,Don't waste your money,DOES NOT FIT in a standard 1 inch weapon mount. But its still a decent flashlight
2,"Works wonders on crows feet, but WATCH OUT, it can cause an allergic reaction.","Practically eliminated noticable fine lines and crows feet within a week, BUT you might want to use it very sparingly at first until you know if you are allergic to it. (Other reviewers have been allergic to it as well.) It can cause an itcy, red burn allergic reaction to your skin. I also got a red skin/burn reaction from it using it on my shins for dryness. I dont want to say dont use it, because it does work wonderfully on fine wrinkles, but at the same time, I want you to know it might cause you reaction problems. I had to quit using it completely. :("
5,frakken wonderful,"great crap , love it. mixes well with other crap I may put in it, should last a long long time no less"
4,So many soundtracks are better than the movie...,"Today so many soundtracks are better than the movie. This has 2 cuts by Stevie Ray Vaughan, 1 by Jimmie Vaughan and 1 by Mo Vaughn (no kidding, but I'm sure it's not the first baseman) Also Little Feat, Albert King, Lyle Lovett and 2 versions of Wild Thing by X."
5,White Nylon Trellis Netting for Vegetables,"As a fan of the Square Foot Gardening method, I purchased this heavy duty white nylon netting to put on my vertical support for my tomatoes. The netting was just the right size to tie on the vertical support I built using electrical conduits 4' x 4'. The netting is supporting my tomatoe plants - it is very heavy duty and retains its white color. You have to be patient when working with the netting and take your time when you first open the package. It is easy to cut the netting to the size you need and tie to the vertical support. I could not find this product at local stores. Purchase and delivery through amazon.com was very quick and easy."
4,Transom mounted Transducer,"Worked great, good price, easy to install. Bought this as a add on to the back of the bass boat."
3,Broken Glasses,"Upon receiving this item, I found a crack in one of the glasses. I'm not sure if this occurred during shipping, but it was unfortunate as the glasses were a birthday present."
4,Nokia 6300 JAVOScreen,"It is a good product, fit exactly the screen, but a week later it start to loose the glue in some part, the glue must be stronger......"
3,horrible font size issues- updated version should be available soon,"This review applies to the Kindle version that exists as of 2/26/2012.It really pains me to do this.....I've read this book before in paper version. It's a great book, by a great author.I originally, reluctantly, gave this a 1 star review because of poor formatting, in a great book.I emailed Mr. Maxim through his website to let him know of the problems, and received a very quick reply that he was working on an updated version to fix the formatting issues. I've raised my rating to 3 stars based on that response.I'm seriously hoping to update this review to a 5 star rating in the near future, if the new version is more readable. The book deserves the 5 star rating, as does Maxim!KentE"
1,Don't buy this,"The delivery of the product was fine, but the keyboard is a piece of junk. The software for the touchpad is a beta version. Several of the keys will lock up the whole keyboard (like NUM Lock and Caps Lock) and a lot of the special features keys did not work at all. The keyboard was barely usable."
5,Enjoyable read,A group of short stories. Easy to pick up and read a little here and there. Puts me into a relaxed mood.
4,"Great looking watch,so so band.","When I received this watch I was actually stunned at how nice it looked.It seemed pretty sturdy too and all for under 50 dollars door to door.However I had to take it to a jeweler to be sized for my wrist.It was on my second return visit to the jeweler to stop a pin from falling out that he stated that the band is ""not a good quality band"". He had to use a glue in order to keep the offending pin in place and so far so good."
2,Playing at alt-country,"Sorry but I didn't like this album very much.Comparing them to real talents like Neil Young, Waylon Jennings, Warren Zevon and the Stones is really laughable but since everyone else seems to do it in their reviews I will say that the band is fronted by someone who goes back and forth TRYING HARD to sound like alternatively Paul Westerberg and Mick Jagger backed by a competent band of hobbyists."
3,very interesting but too short,i really enjoyed this game. once i started playing i didn't want to put it down. there are only 4 real cases and they are pretty simple to figure out. i wish there were more cases in addition the extras. i finished the game pretty quick still wanting more. it's a good game but it would have been better if there had just been more.
3,Very fun; but disappointingly short.,"I played this game all the way through in a relatively short amount of time.Its fun; and the graphics are adorable; and the characters are highly amusing. Kids would like it, but I think only adults could fully appreciate it.On the downside; it is disappointingly short, with no replay value to speak of.Get it if you don't mind the fact that you'll probably never play it again after you finish it."
1,Not Good,"The Mallory E-Spark is a piece of crap. I installed it precisely according to the instructions, verified proper coil voltage and ohms, and it wouldn't hit a lick. Their idiot tech support tried to say there wasn't a good ground between the head/intake/block. I guess all those bolts and brackets holding it all together don't count, and my Fluke meter is junk. Stuck the points back in and it fired right up. Go figger. Tested the optical module and it failed. On a bright note, Amazon gave me a pretty fast full refund for defective product.Sam"
4,review for ses vultures,This is a very good album. Much better than anxiety. The lyrics are very good and catchy as usaull with some new guitar sound. This album has a good mix of slow songs and more traditional SES songs
4,Whee-lo knockoff,"This is a modern knockoff of the original Whee-lo. Yep, it's cheap and cheaply made. But, yep, it's still as much fun as the original was. Don't expect it to compete with a video game, just enjoy it for what it is--a bit of mindless fun from the past."
4,magnetic rail toy,product came as described shipped safely and in great condition the info on the site was accurate and informative. i hope to make future purchases with this company
2,Poor size and quality,"When I was a child, we had a product called the ""Wheelo"". Same design as this product but much better quality. This product works- but not as smoothly and is made of very cheap metal and plastic.Not worth the money."
5,Railroad watch,Best deal I could find on a railroad approved watch after searching eBay as well as Amazon.com. Adjusted the wrist band myself after receiving the watch. Works perfect.
1,JUNK,"Bought this watch expecting the same quality as my last railroad approved watch,First of all it doesn't keep up with the date/day. Then the adjustment knob fell of and got lost,(probably worn out from having to reset the date/day all the time). DO NOT BUY!"
3,Only for the Professional!,"Okay, I read all the other views, but I sell Real Estate, and lots of it - I can tell you that she nails the emotions many people attach to their homes. If you make your living selling homes you will find this book helpful, especially if you've had a run of nut case buyers!"
3,"ok vac, great price",Pretty good for the price. Hate the feeling when the exhaust blowing at my face although no dust coming out.
3,Wet/Dry Dust Buster,"I am a bit disappointed with it. We live on the beach and I got it for sand and dog hair. I deliberately got the 7.2 volt instead of the lower voltage one hoping for more suction. On sand it's great. On dog hair if it is attached to anything, like a couch pillow, etc. Plan on it staying there.I have not tried the wet part and probably won't since that was not what I bought it for. I suggest they add a small brush at the end that brings things like dog and cat hair loose so you can get it up."
1,disappointed,This DustBuster has not lived up to its predecessors. It does not seem to suck up dirt in the same way as others I have had. I think the molding of the front end may decrease the contact and suction.
2,Not great,"The battery didn't work for long for me. The unit would only go for a few minutes. It definitley did not pick liquids up at all. The opening is too small to pick up very much (for example, cat food). The canister is TINY. It works for crumbs, so if that is your issue then you'd be happy with it. You can at least suck up the wet crubs without the product shorting out."
4,BF2 made slightly better,"BF2 SF continues the tradition of BF2 with the addition of new maps, vehicles, weapons, and equipment. I like the SF maps because they're medium sized and allow for a lot of different sniping locations and ""things to do"". Some of the BF2 64 player maps are so large that you find yourself running around from Pt A to Pt B too often."
1,Sorry... EA Stinks on this one too.,"If you want to spend 30 bucks to get to the top of building, go for it.Otherwise, it's just a way to make everything so dark and nasty that you don't want to play. It really is bad.And, by the way, anytime you buy the online version you should just buy a club and beat yourself up too. EA does the worst online purchase of games possible. They really stink."
3,FUN but STEEP System Requirements,"I have a pretty fast system that should be in about the top 25% of the gaming systems (3.2GHZ, 6800GT, 2GB, RAID drives). The game is a lot of fun but it is taxing my system to the limits. The graphics can be occasionally choppy at 1280 x 1024 with NO AA. I can't even think about 1600 x 1200. The only people that might get acceptable frame rates at 1600 x 1200 are the AMD 4000, dual 7800 crowd. The new levels and weapons are fun, I just wish I had an AMD 6000 with quad 7800's and cryogenic cooling for more overclocking."
4,Entertainment . . . that's why I read!!,"I read to take a break, unwind, and relax. The title made me pick this book up. Having never read anything by Sara Lewis I had no expectations. Yes, it was an easy read. Easy because it was entertaining, fun and I fell very quickly into the lives of the characters. I, like Mimi, love music. Having this in common immediately bonded me to the story teller. I love how Sara Lewis told this story. It made me feel as if I were reading a letter and catching up with a dear friend I hadn't spoken with for a while. I am a loyal, faithful reader of authors who touch my heart with their talent . . . and gift. Thanks to Amazon I have the titles of Sara's other books. I look forward to reading them all. I will be adding Ms. Lewis to my list of authors I wait anxiously for news of a new release. Enjoy . . . I sure did!!"
4,Documentary,While I am not the UFO nut in the house my wife seemed to think this was interesting. Its a detailed documentary. A little long for me but she enjoyed it. (several seperate viewings)
5,These are great,"I have had a Toro Powerlite 3 hp for over 12 years. It is the electic start version and it is great. I have replaced the paddels twice in that time and it still keeps going. I also have a big 10.5 Troy Bilt for the big snow, but for anything up to 4 to 5 inches these are the best and they clean right down to the sidewalk or driveway. You cannot beat it for the price."
4,J.W. Campbell made sci-fi what it is today!,I got acquainted with the work of John W. Campbell when I saw the movie 'The Thing'. I liked it so much that I watched the end credits and saw it was based on the story 'Who Goes There?' which is included in this book. So naturally you can get a taste of just how good a writer he was by reading this collection of his work. He was one of the pioneers of sci-fi and crafted its direction for decades. He pushed other sci-fi writers to strive for excellence where good just wasn't good enough and it shows! Don't just take it from me. Give his work a try!
4,"Informative, and very in-depth. Not simply an introduction.","I had to order this book for an entrepreneurship course. It's full of very valuable information, but it's not a good starting point if you're new to the idea of a startup. Before reading this I'd recommend Smartups by Rob Ryan."
2,Obsoleted when it came out,"I see so many people who brought it in 2003 or 2004 say it's obsolete because they couldn't download the internet lessons. Guess what, I brought it directly from The Learning Company when it came out in 2002, and I couldn't download any of the internet lesson since the beginning. I called technical support, they told me the internet courses will be available later, since the product is very new at the time I brought it. I waited and waited, the internet courses never available. The CD is too basic, and it doesn't offer much. People should look else where for a better quality product than Learn to Speak English 8.1."
5,Excellent!!!!,"Item was recieved in a timely fashion. The book is very detailed and has helped me get through some of the tougher mazes, and traps. Easy to read and follow."
5,What I dreamed for as a child...,"They say that parents often attempt to live their lives vicariously through their children. Well, I purchased this cute little number for my daughter's 3rd birthday, mostly because I hope she'll love tea some day as much as I do. This is the perfect size for a child's tea set - would only be too small if using adult sized cups. A great companion is the sugar cube set - also by Haba. The tin is adorable, the size is perfect, and hopefully my daughter will be able to give this to her own child some day, fostering another tea lover of her own!"
2,Bummer,"These are really cute and my daughter loves to play with them. However, the strings constantly get tangled with each other. It seems we spend more time detangling these then actually playing with them."
4,Ok,"My wife really enjoys this show, but I would guess so, since the screenplay leans towards a soap opera anyway."
5,A Saddleseat Primer,"The author, Helen Crabtree, is a noted horsewoman. She's won the AHSA Horsewoman of the Year Award and the United Professional Horseman Associations's Trainer of the Year award. She has trained over 75 World Champions with her methods. This book shares her expertise. The book deals with the mechanics of riding Saddle Seat, proper tack, and rider attire, but does not deal with judging Saddle Seat. The emphasis is on showing."
1,What a waste of money!,"The tests in this book are generic and completely useless. For example, one test is called the ""The procrastination scale,"" in which you mark true or false to things like ""I tend to put things off."" Then at the end you add up the number of points (according to answers they have determined you ""should"" have answered) and then it tells you how you compare to others. So, if I scored a 70, it means ""70 percent of people procrastinate less than me."" Gee that was helpful in choosing a career."
3,"A good ""educational"" text",This book would be a great addition to a business-related course in college that discusses the many different types of tests available to gauge a person's strengths. I would NOT buy this book (which I mistakenly did) to determine what career is best suited for me. I would consider this an academic book only. The authors do provide good insight and history of each test offered in their book.
4,Good for self-exploration,"This is s good book to use if you have an idea of what you enjoy, but are not fixed on any particular career. The book is loaded with mini quizzes on your own personality and preferences. Some of the categories are: Career Activities Scale, Career Values Scale, Work Commitment Scale, Stress at Work Scale, and so on. The author does not go on and on about himself, the feedback comments were completely inaccurate in that regard.I would recommend this book to someone who wants to change careers and is not sure in which direction to go, high schoolers and homemakers returning to the work force.The scoring is not hard to follow if one pays attention to the instructions."
2,A disappointment,"The book contains a number of careless errors. For example, it repeatedly states that King Oliver recorded Morton's ""Wolverine Blues"" (which he didn't--they're confusing it with ""Weatherbird Rag,"" written by Louis Armstrong). Regarding ""solo tunes... recorded on July 8, 1929,"" the authors mention ""'Pop' (a revisiting of 'Seattle Hunch')."" The correct title, ""Pep,"" bears some similarity to the earlier ""Stratford Hunch,"" not to ""Seattle Hunch,"" which was recorded after ""Pep."" Other mistakes are evident...Also, the focus on Morton's health and financial problems comes at the expense of his musical achievements--his monumental Library of Congress sessions receive a single paragraph in the main text. For those interested in Morton, I'd recommend the great ""'Oh, Mister Jelly' - A Jelly Roll Morton Scrapbook"" by William Russell and ""Mister Jelly Lord"" by Laurie Wright (neither are easy to find), as well as ""Dead Man Blues"" and the landmark ""Mister Jelly Roll."""
2,TeleZapper,"Don't waste your money, not worth it. We continue to get annoying calls every day! I will unplug it and put it in the trash can."
1,It did not work,"This is the second TeleZapper TZ900 I have purchased that does not work. Trying to get in touch with Privacy Technologies can not be done. The phone number in the manual, 1-800-373-6290, is a flooring company, the web site is down doing maintenance for three days now. Both new in the package units did not send a code to the computers that are dialing my phone. Also both units caused a problem with my phone system. I use Vonage and have V-Tech base with 6 wireless handsets. I had to reload my Vonage router with both units. I really need this type of device and have tried several times to purchase one that works. Support seems to be non-existent. I am still trying to get in touch with someone at Privacy Technologies."
4,Telezapper,"Years ago, I had a Zapper. It had an attachment where I could also ""Zap"" numbers, or stop other unwanted numbers. I thought this one Zapper would do the same. However, there is no attachment. From what I understand, the Zapper will prevent unwanted numbers for the most part, and I can lift the phone receiver for two or three seconds, to prevent other numbers. I tried that and the numbers keep coming through. There must be something that I am not doing right. Otherwise, I believe the Zapper does what it is suppose to do."
2,Poor quality,I was not satisfied with this item because of poor quality.When I received it there was a small dent in the scraper and the chrome plated grip was pitted. It looked as if the metal was rusty or not properly cleaned before before the chrome plating was applied.I was going to return it but someone that I know saw it and purchased from me.They said for scraping crumbs it would be ok.I am a firm believer that a new product should not have any defects no matter what it cost.
1,Why we buy,This book is outdated and full of useless information. I do not recommend this book at all. We're reading this book for a marketing class and half of the information and studies are not relevant.
4,Intriguing Book About Something We All Do--Shop!,"I, for one, will never enter a store again & view shopping in the manner I did before I read this fabulous book. As Underhill points out, it's unfortunate that the people who lay out store floor plans & market products in the stores fall far short of common business sense when it comes to the ins & outs of understanding how consumers shop. Although the book becomes a tad stagnant in the middle, it is well-worth reading."
3,"Nice to read, however, the word science would not apply","I enjoyed reading the book. I also think that after reading it, one can build frameworks of observation and improve the way to evaluate the company's retail environment. One of the major achievements of the book is to teach marketing people that much of the customer research needs to be done in the store and that the small details may lead to amazing tactics to improve customer satisfaction and also to upsell him. However, I was disappointed as I was searching for some new guidelines of theory of action and I didn't found any. The book is not structured in order to teach a new science it is rather anecdotical. Compared to the book why people buy (Oxford press, John O'Shaughnessy) the book stays far, far behind to bring on a new proposal. I think that, after reading the book, there is thirst. I'm sure that the author managed to promote his consultancy and certainly, he will grow his database."
4,No better than the original version,"I bought the updated version because I thought the author may have some interesting research about online shopping behavior to share. However, the Chapter about Internet is really useless. Apparently, Mr. Underhill have no idea about how online shoppers can be studied."
2,Book or Sales Brochure?!?,"Although the subject matter is undeniably interesting, the book's aggregate content is unquestionably remedial. Underhill accomplishes a 200-page sales brochure...want to learn more, read on?!?....no....hire our consultants!!! tacky, tacky, tacky."
5,Every employee of a retailer should read this book!,"Anyone connected with selling to the public should check this out. It gets into how our heads work. Have you ever looked for something that was supposed to be in a certain place and somebody had moved it 2 ft. You couldn't find it! Then began searching everywhere! Finally you found it only 2 ft. away. That is how it works in stores for stuff we don't know we are looking for it. If product is nor organized properly we do not see it and it does not sell. Association is all wrong in most of retailing. We sell shower curtains with shower curtain rods, drapes with drapery rods, candle sticks with candles, but we do not sell towel racks, with towels. We sell belts with pants, but no pant racks with pants, we sell earings, scarfs, coats, exercise clothes, socks, shoes together, but not clothes trees or clothes hooks. Retailers are missing HOME RUNS by association. They could run them as props in the same ads and get full margin."
3,I have reservations with the book living up to the title,"I was personally hoping this book would tell me why I feel the compulsion to buy different things when I go into stores. I was hoping to arm myself with strategic information to stop or even control the impulse purchase. This book is meant for retailers, stores, and other businesses in designing comfort for their customers to create an environment where their customers are happy and willing to buy. I really feel that this book isn't for the consumer, but the retailer. Great book if you are looking to brush up on how to get your customers to buy more products."
4,Why We Buy,I have really enjoyed reading Why We Buy by Paco Underhill. I find it fascinating that there is such a science behind why a consumer makes a purchase and why a retailer places products in certain areas of the store. Looking at it from a consumer point of view gives my shopping experiences a whole new meaning. I look for placements and I also try to notice things that are not necessarily put in a popular place just to see what those items might be.
4,A good read about shopping AND human nature,"Okay, so you're thinking (unless you're a retailer like me) that you have absolutely NO interest in a book about shopping? Read this anyway; I guarantee that you will be not only entertained, but also educated about people's shopping habits -- and people. The author -- a self-proclaimed ""urban geographer"" -- is unusual in his approach to examine the shopping EXPERIENCE. And it's fascinating. For instance, he says people always look to the right when they enter a store. (Test yourself!) And, for the first 15 feet inside, they are somewhat disoriented (meaning oblivious to any products or signs). As others have said, this book DOES read like a long magazine article -- but I think that's a GOOD thing. And so did The New Yorker, which excerpted it. In fact, it's because of Underhill's great storytelling ability that this book is as much about people and human nature as it is about shopping. Truly enjoyable."
1,Misleading title...,"The title suggests that the book discusses the psychology and science of shopping and consumerism. It doesn't. At best, it provides some practical advice to retailers on how to catch the customer's eye, where to position product displays, etc.If you're looking for a book that actually digs into the psychology and science of consumerism, you might try ""How Customers Think: Essential Insights Into the Mind of the Market"" by Gerald Zaltman."
5,Best book I've seen on wireless LANs!!,"If you're developing or implementing wireless LANs, this is definitely the book you should have! After reading the book, it's evident the author (Jim Geier) has a great deal of practical experience implementing wireless networks. His writing style makes the book very pleasant to read. The book does a great job of explaining up-to-date wireless LAN technologies and implemenation steps. The chapters on the IEEE 802.11 standard show how the protocol works and cleared up a lot of my previous confusion of what the standard can and can't do. Additional chapters show what you need to do in order to compensate for where 802.11 falls short. I especially enjoyed the many case studies and implementation notes spread throughout the book. They showed how the concepts can be used in the real world."
3,good for lan planing not so good for implementation,"The value of any reference or text depends on your objective in using the book. Some of the prior reviews led me to buy this book. It is well written but did not address 802.11 issues at the level I needed. So, like a text, the value of a review also depends on whether you and the reviewer have similar objectives in mind.I used this book when called upon to implement 802.11. The IEEE spec leaves a lot of issues open to product implementation, as it should. As we were not working from a product spec but only the IEEE standard, I hoped this book could clear up some of the implementation issues for us. It was to high a level for that purpose.If you are looking for a text as an overview of wireless LANs, this is a very good book. It is well written and balanced. For this I give it four stars. For a text to guide you in implementation of the standard in a product, it is not worth the time or money - two stars."
3,redundant belabored point,"Too many pages repeating the same disdain for John Murray's exception clause opinion. The authors need a basic English major to write for them, due to their heavy ""scholarly"" style. Their early church fathers chapter is quite limited in scope, and does not appear honest."
3,Fantasy baby!,"This book is a very mystical fantasy book. Its about elves and demons its very interesting actually. There are many relations with the demons and the elf (Tom). The relations with them both is actually very fascinating. It inspires young readers, and is a very creative writing. Good job!"
5,In my top 10 of all time,"Karl de Man, the young protagonist of this book is a precocious, gifted and amazing child. He is a student at a prestigious South African music academy and seduces his 30- something-year old male choir director. Karl is raised on a South African game preserve, well-traveled and well-read and this book brims with intelligence about the land, the animals and the people of South Africa. Behr's ability to articulate the feelings of this wonderful child is uncanny and his unflinching eye reveals the racism and homophobia of his milieu. The narrative is captivating. If you are looking for a great story, this is it. For me the book at 750 plus pages was too short. I didn't want it to ever end."
2,Pretty but not comfortable,"I purchased this for my 2 yr old daughter who was going to be a flower girl. Pretty pricey for a shoe that's not comfortable. The sole has no rubber or traction stability. When my daughter tried them on, she instantly slipped and fell. Pretty dangerous shoe for a 2 yr old. They are very narrow and have no shape. You can't even tell which is the left or right foot. The satin is very smooth and pretty and the color is perfect. And you might want to purchase it if your little girl will be in it for a few minutes, but just add a rubber sticker to the bottom."
1,Not Up To Par Product,Would I recommend this product NO NO NOAfter removing it from the bubble case and giving it a whirl I realized this is a piece of junk and not up to B&D; standards.1) You have to have super strong fingers to activate the unit. It will only run if you push near the bottom of the buttons and even very hard.2) You have to make sure you have the unit oriented properly or you will be pushing the reverse instead of forward all the time.3) You can't return it the ANT place. If you bought from Amazon they would accept it with no questions.Bottom line stay clear and buy a different model.
4,I needed this years ago.,"I have a bulky and powerful Craftsman professional drill which I've been using for all my home upkeep needs. The Black and Decker AS600 is so much earier to use for typical projects I can't believe I waited so long.It's not perfect--for instance the bits sometime stay with the screw when you pull the tool away. Also I'd prefer to have the forward and backward switch not in mirror image location. It's necessary to look to see if you are using the right one. Regardless of these minor annoyances, it is worth every penny."
4,Perfect for small jobs,"This small, battery-operated screwdriver is not hugely powerful, but it gets the job done for small household jobs. (For heavy-duty jobs requiring a powerful cordless screwdriver, this will not fit the bill.)Despite the low price, this tool feels well-constructed and has a good heft. It saves a lot of manual work, especially if you're doing a project that would have you using the screwdriver over and over. My only complaint would be that its fat handle makes it hard to reach certain tight corners. (But it does mean that the screwdriver is comfortable to grip!)I recommend this screwdriver, but keep the old-fashioned manual set handy too!"
5,Great Product !,This product actually works on curly & hard to manage hair. It controls the frizzles and leaves hair manageable. Use it on wet or dry hair but don't over use; it's a serum and will go a long way.
2,"Beautiful, but fragile.","When the necklace arrived I was so happy. It shifted from baby blue to a peachy-orange in the light and if the sun hit it right small hearts were reflected onto the nearby walls and ceiling. I'm not sure whether I was too rough with it, but after noticing that I had strange scratches on my chest I inspected the necklace and realized it had chipped. I never dropped the necklace or smacked it around but it had one large chip at the end of the point of a flake and another small one. I can no longer wear the necklace because it leaves scratches all across my chest, and am very disappointed. Perhaps if I purchased a longer chain I would not have this problem. But a necklace should not be so fragile. Be careful with it if you do decide to buy it."
4,If you love Irish music you have to have this,If you love Irish or Celtic music you have to have this session. The tunes are short but I got it to practice with my bodhran. It is a wonderful resource and a one stop location for many of the traditional tunes that you maybe looking for.
2,Save me please.,"I am fortunate to have both this version on DVD and the 1936 version on a Criterion Laserdisk. I simply do not understand those who believe the 1951 version is better. Just the joy of Paul Robeson and Hattie McDaniel in the key support roles makes the 1936 version a joy to watch over and over again. Friends who know that I own this 1936 gem come over to my house just to see Showboat as it was meant to be seen. Perhaps if the other reviewers had seen both versions, they would agree with me. Until the 1936 version is released on DVD, however, they will just need to ""scratch their heads"" and wonder what ""all the fuss"" is about."
4,We Could Make Believe.........,"Well what can one really say. The film is old fashioned, the songs are old fashioned the costumns are old fashioned, the make-up is old fashioned, the story - is timeless. As I sat carried away by the spendour of real entertainment I found it hard to believe that there is no place on the modern screen for ""Make Believe"". This movie has so many wonderful songs to its credit. The costumns are spectacular, the ladies (Kathryn Grayson and Ava Gardner) are real ladies who are beautiful and serene. The hero (Howard Keel) is hansome and a lovable scallywag who sings magnificently. The dancers are accomplished and professional and carry you away into their song and dance routines. The song ""Old Man River"" steals the show of course and creates the feeling of the power and majesty of the mighty Mississippi. The quality of the reproduction is not up to todays standard of excellence on DVD but for those of us who love the ""oldies"" this one is a must in your collection."
4,Great Musical,I've always been a fan of musicals and this is one of my favorites. I'm glad to add this to my collection.
1,waste of money,I am embarrassed I paid even a penny for this. Don't waste your money. No interviews with the band. No music from the band. Just interviews with three unnamed wanna-bees.
3,Avenged Sevenfold: Not Enough Music,"I was hoping this DVD had some older concert footage however it is basically all documentary of the band thus far with ""The Rev"" still alive and in the band's future when it was all taken away just like that. RIP ""Rev"" the best up and coming drummer in hard Rock/Metal."
3,kero can,"The Blitz kero can got here too late, I was snowed in here on the mountain until Jan 8,2013. I had to go into town & buy a 5 gallon kerosene can filled with kerosene before i was snowed in again. I needed the kerosene for my heater.Your Blitz 5 gallon kerosene can didn't get her until Jan 9. It snowed me in again on Jan 10."
1,worst map I ever bought,"I've bought lots of maps, many of them here. This is the only map I ever wanted to return. The problem is with the CBD. The rest of the map is not that bad. For the CBD, they put too much information in too small an area. It is color coded, which makes it worse. It is incredibly cluttered and difficult to read."
5,Beautiful...,"The sounds on this lovely CD reach a place indescribable...Truly healing, truly beautiful."
1,Better Than the Competition,"I just purchased both The Learning Channel's ""Learn to Speak 8.1"" and Transparent Language's ""Spanish Now! v9."" I can tell you, first hand, that TLC's product is at least twice as good. I assumed that the higher priced (Spanish Now!)of the two would be a better product. WRONG! This software has a poor user interface, in addition, it doesn't guide the user through the process of learning the language. Save your money and get TLC's CD."
3,Beware of Deceptive Marketing,"If the idea of an Internet based Study Plan is one of your reasons for purchasing this program BEWARE. Since I purchased this program, for that exact reason, there has not been a functioning Study Plan available. It should be noted this program has been on the market for almost a year and the program information and packaging still indicate the existance of a Study Program. Granted it is only one feature, but still The Learning Company knows the feature is not usable and continues to produce the program as stated. This is a prime example of deceptive marketing.One good feature of the program is the ability to record, judge and listen to your pronunciation."
3,"A museum piece, yes, but a reading tool it is not.","This is probably the most beautiful tarot in my collection. Jiu's expert implementation of flowing vibrant colors, fine lines and subtle shading resulted in 78 breathtaking mini-paintings. His women are exquisitely fine-boned and willowy, the men debonair and gallant, and the sceneries ---- absolutely evocative. If you gaze at these beautifully scenic cards long enough, you'll want to leap into them and be part of the action!The down-side is that 75% of these 78 cards do not conform with their traditional Tarot assignations. The worst culprits are the pips - total chaos... It seemed Stuart Kaplan forgot to give Jiu basic lessons on Tarot symbology (or a reference Rider-Waite deck) when he commissioned him. However, the alluring nature of the artwork is such that it has you thinking that you underpaid when you bought this ""tarot"" deck!"
5,A 'must' for any member of the 'next generation employer',"Eric Chester's Getting Them To Give A Damn: How To Get Your Front Line To Care About Your Bottom Line provides an excellent key to turning uncaring employees into performers and innovators. The latest generation shares a new set of values and won't blindly conform to company policy - but they can be motivated, and 'Generation Y expect' author Eric Chester shows how. From recruiting the best new employees to using different types of training to make them loyal, this is a 'must' for any member of the 'next generation employer'."
2,Bertie and Elizabeth: an overview,"Having a thorough knowledge of the events surrounding the life of George VI of England is something of a liability when viewing Bertie and Elizabeth. Although the actress who plays his wife, Queen Elizabeth, bears some slight resemblance to her character, every other actor in this production fails in this respect. In some cases, their lack of credibility cripples this production, and at best, this is a tepid and unsatisfying look at what was an important and dramatic period in England's history."
2,Short of one DVD,"The DVD is excellent. But the mailing service is not recommondated. This DVD is in 2 volume. When I ordered last summer, it came only 1 volume. I didn't realized it until I watch it in December. It is too late to return. So I have to spend another $15.00 to order another set of the same movie. Now I have a extra volume I of this DVD, don't know what to do with it. Can't give it to my friend a unfinished DVD story."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this product thinking it was an upgrade to a previous version, but it is clunky and hard to use. You cannot move between family members easily and uploading to a website doesn't give you choices on what to show and what not. Very impersonal, would not recommend."
1,A Big Waste of Money,"This would have been a wonderful product if it could be installed on my computer. I have tried to install it using Windows 2000 and Windows 98. Neither system would accept it. When I called the company, they said that they knew about the problem and were working on it...to check back at their web site periodically for an update. That was over a year ago. There have been no updates and I basically wasted my money."
1,Didn't hold up,Bought 2 of these binders for a middle school child and the cover split from the binding within a month. Don't waste your money on these.
2,Small,"Hard to understand the description. If you want to bind 8 1/2 x 11 papers, fine. If you want to put plastic covers on the page, this binder is too small with all of the papers falling over the edge. Also, the 'rings' only work if you pull them apart, not with the two operational hinges."
4,Fubar,This tool is really heavy. If you have to use it all day you will get quite a workout. The downside is that the hammer head is not milled so if you use it to pound out nails from the back of the board that you just ripped off something it is pretty tough to hit the nail squarely. I found that it was exasperating to constantly have to straighten the nail in order to hit it squarely. The hammer head is 1) Too small and 2) Too smooth.
5,"Talented, Vivacious!","This guy is great! We were lucky enough to see him in person at the Peppermill Casino in Reno, NV! He can impersonate several voices and has a great singing style of his own. He is energetic and enthusiastic! He sang ""Lady Luck"" and I won! Must have been his charisma! Everyone should buy this cd!"
3,"It's okay, but not the best...","I discovered Candace Camp quite recently. I read A Lady Never Tells and really liked it. I than read Suddenly and LOVED it. So naturally I was eager to read Scandalous, but it's kinda a hard book to follow with a little too much going on... Two missing heirs, kidnapping, woman's suffrage and predictable couplings everywhere.. usually I can read a book fairly quickly, but I struggled with this one... I still like Candace Camp's style, but I don't think I'm going to hang on to this particular book."
3,"Interesting, but not a favorite","I bought this to go with my EmWave biofeedback device because the EmWave people recommend it so highly. They say it works even if you don't like the music. That's a good thing because I am not a fan of dissonance, which shows up several times on this CD.I'm not sure that it works any better than the Jeffery Thompson theta meditation CD that I also got from Amazon and I enjoy it much more."
4,Great video but no merchandise to support fans,"My 3 year old has fallen in love with Dora and the Explorer Girls. The movie is just as charming and educational as the regular Dora stories, but Nick Jr has stopped marketing this brand. This means there is no merchandise like toys or dolls to support its biggest fans. My daughter has been asking for a Dora the Explorer Doll and the only thing like that out there is a dora doll that connects to the computer. In addition, this is a limited eddition so the only sellers are through Amazon and they are way overpriced ($60-$90). My complaint is not with the video, I do think its entertaining and smart. My complaint is that it never took off for Nickelodeon and now there is nothing fun to buy along with the dvd!"
5,Excellent tool,"I appreciate someone who finally invented a book that gives example essays, grammar and exercises. I could also look at the outlines with the different styles of where to put things. That helped a lot. Thanks for the help. It is worth all the price."
2,No Index,"As a genealogy reference or guide I found this book to be a dud.It has almost the worst Index I have ever seen. Sources that are mentioned in the text are not in the index nor clearly explained.As an example the source I know as the ""Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature"" was mentioned, more than once, under an odd acronym and I did not find any explanation or comment on the acronym or the different title."
3,NOT HAPPY WITH QUALITY,"Thought this was going to be an easy project. As we followed the directions very exactly, opening the chain link to attach the lamp, then closing the link again as they specified in the directions. The link, which was obviously not made of anything close to a pure metal, snapped and we watched our $90 purchase smash on our diningroom table. My only option to click on is to make a return label. Not sure what you want returned, but I hope someone can send me a new one. I have since contacted customer service, and they are replacing the lamp for me. I'm very grateful for this. but I will purchase my own chain so the same issue does not occur.---Another adendum to my review. Not only was amazon willing to replace the lamp quite easily, it was delivered to my house in LESS than 24 hours! Amazing! Thank you for great customer service!"
2,Monteilhet is no match for Smith's De Visee,"The music sometimes sounds rather muddy in Monteilhet's hands, so that turning to Hopkinson Smith's versions of some of the same pieces immediately seems to clarify the composer's intentions. Apart from Smith, Moreno on Glossa also offers a better introduction to De Visee's fine music than Monteilhet. However, Monteilhet does offer some pieces unavailable elsewhere, which earns him some merit for good intentions."
2,Learning German 8.1,This has a good text book and a pretty good listening to phrases CD. But the PC CD's don't allways work and in fact I had some trouble trying to reload after some problems that crashed my system. In fact it has never worked since. So I am unhappy with this product because it has been mostly user unfriendly and a waste of time and money for me...David G
5,Raymond Burr is Perry Mason,"Raymond Burr and Perry Mason, to me, are the same person. He was a fine example of justice and the underdog. He is responsible for so many lawyers, becomming lawyers ..... and every show was entertaining."
4,Good Blu Ray Transfer,"Hopefully you have already read the editorial & other reviews on this page to get a basic Idea of what the film is about & who plays what etc .. I enjoyed the movie & think the Blu Ray transfer of the picture & sound quality are good. the entire experience is a great work out for your home theatre system.However the slight drawback is that sometimes with the sharpness & clarity of most Blu Ray discs, we can make out the special effect shots that normally were lost in regular DVD's.on the plus side is the cost of this disc. I think its worth it if you have been a fan of 'VAN HELSING'"
4,van helsing download review,"The video and sound quality was good. The film did stop a few times, but it wasn't too bothersome. I have had pretty good success with amazon downloads."
3,Kids never got into the movie - nor did I!,The story was just not as good as I was expecting and the acting was okay. Definitely sticking with the classics like Indiana Jones!
4,Good adventure movie,"I watched this movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it. It's all about a crusader trying to rid the world of evil doers and coming face-to-face with his greatest advesary Dracula. He's helped with the aid of his side-kick and the georgeous Anna (played by Kate Beckinsale) who also wants to see the distruction of Dracula.Now the movie is all about having fun, with non-stop action and mayhem. I know alot of people complained about how silly it is but I think it's ment to be this way. I mean the idea of these monsters are silly anyway so why not make the movie not so serious and just poke fun here and there.The only negative thing I could say is that the music was a bit to loud and the movie played a bit to long but apart from those things a really good movie."
5,i'm rating Mr. HUGH JACKMAN!!!!!!!,"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOMEGREAT BODY, GREAT ACTING, GREAT EVERYTHING!!!!now, lets see HIM in more GREAT romantic COMEDIES!!!"
2,Wait for the video,"I paid money for popcorn and drinks. The admission price wasn't too bad, but I would have rather watched this VERY predictable, CGI rich piece in the comfort of my own living room. No surprises, no suspense. Thrills came at the expense of up-close 'in your face' monsters jumping out of the edges of the screen. Animations were CLEARLY animations, not much to make you believe otherwise. My wife and daughter went to see ""Mean Girls"" in the other theater and seemed to have a better time than I did."
2,Another mindless Hollywood production!,"I give this movie two stars just because the FX are pretty good, the action is very dynamic (somewhat MATRIX style) and the women are very, very hot! The acting was not good except for the main character, and the plot is as simple as a blank page. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
2,Could have been better. 2.5 stars,I love these kind of movies but I was somewhat disappointed with van helsing. First off when the movie starts off it seams like some sort of spoof film based on the old frankenstein movie. Once the black and white section ends it starts to get a little better. The most disappointing part about the movie I thought was the dracula character. He had a very poor stage presence which made his character very dull. Overall it is somewhat entertaining but they could have done better.
1,Don't See Van Helsing,I don't know what Universal was thinking when they approved this script. Anyone who has ever seen an action/horror film should not watch this movie. It is by far the worst movie I have seen in recent years. I recently purchased the Legacy Collection and it pains me that the Van Helsing movie is even mentioned on the DVD's of these timeless classics. They are works of art and this is a piece of garbage. The plot is ridiculous and the CG is lousy. The most appauling thing is the actors struggling through every scene while trying to maintain their horrible over the top accents. Anyone who is thinking of seeing this movie should use the money to invest in the classic DVD set instead because Van Helsing is a travesty.
3,Van Helsing,"This was one of those fun romps,sometime funny and a bit over acted,But I enjoy it. love Jackman and Beckinsale. I have them on multiple other discs. BUT,I wont be spending the the money on the Blu-Ray version. This price is WAY out of line!"
1,TERRIBLE!,"I watched the clock hoping that it would end quickly and put me out of my misery.Complete disaster. I found myself laughing although it is certainly not intended asa comedy. Jackman and Beckinsale must have gotten huge paydays to agree to be partof this garbage. The acting is so bad, and the characters so undeveloped, that at the end,you honestly don't care who wins or if they all die. You just want it to end. Even the CGeffects are poor when compared to other films of similar genre. Take my advice, save yourmoney, and just stick some needles under your fingernails instead to get the same amountof enjoyment."
1,Van Helsing,This was one of the worst movies I have watched in a long time. It was a tedious attempt to make Hugh Jackman a hero. This film's plot what ever it was was such nonesense that I was unable to finish it
5,Campy Horror,"Campy does not necessarily mean bad. Yes, there is satire and special effects. They are not what dominates the film. For me, the high point is the writing, the story. What I really like is the way three classic horror creatures have been implemented into one cohesive story. The addition of the other three movies makes this an excellent addition to my horror library. If you don't like the movie maybe you should get off your high horse and remember what entertainment was supposed to be about."
3,More action movie than horror movie,"If you buy this looking for a horror movie or scary movie you will be disappointed, however if you watch this as a campy action movie, its passable.Hugh Jackman gives an okay performance as the lead character of Van Helsing. Kate Beckinsale makes for an unmemorable ""Bond girl"" type sidekick. There are a few laughs, a lot of action, monsters galore and innumerable special effects. All of this comes together to make a James Bond style action flick as opposed to a monster or horror movie.There's nothing particularly awful about this movie, but unless you're a fan of special effects, there's nothing particularly great about it either. It was entertaining once, but I think it would be boring for a second viewing."
1,This movie sucked.,"This movie was so boring. I thought at least it would entertain me but it was just crap. A movie about a guy who goes around hunting monsters should, if even done somewhat well, be one of my favorites so that says quite a bit. I gave it one star because what's her face is pretty hot but other than that I hate this movie."
2,Go See Interview With The Vampire or Blade atleast,I wanted badly to like it but it was kinda pointless and dumb. It had one part that I enjoyed which was the flying women vampires who get tricked. But other than that I couldn't recommend it because it's not entertaining. It could have been shorter also but that's just me saying. I did like the end when it said for my dad. That was sweet.
3,"Nice for a time, but over time kind of fizzles","I bought Van Helsing on DVD and really enjoyed it when I first bought it. I watched it a number of times and still continued to like it, but I also recognize a number of flaws in the movie. Most of the flaws I feel the movie has are in character development and to much information that is presented and never solved, and because it is a movie and not a TV series this can become problematic. Some aspects of the special effects were nice. The main problem area with the speical effects is in the final fight scene where it just looks to fake.Yet, all in all I enjoyed this movie and am glad that is a part of my DVD library. I would say that it is a worth while buy, especially if you can get it used. Because it is a sci-fi roller coaster ride type of movie, don't expect oscar performances, but non the less a good flic."
4,A Fun Summer Popcorn Movie,"Van Helsing is what it was meant to be: Loud, somewhat ridiculous, campy fun, and non-stop action. I disagree with reviewers who bash the plot. The story was simple enough: Dracula needs Frankenstein to help his offspring come to life. Ok, maybe that's a tad bit corny, but it's certainly not complicated. I think Stephen Sommers would have been wise to slow the action down just a tad and toss in a little character development, but as is, Van Helsing is certainly not the crappy movie some people would have you believe it is. It is mindless adventure, but adventure none the less, sometimes exciting, ocassionally funny, but never boring. A sequel might work if they did a better job of fleshing out the characters. The actors certainly did their parts, with 5 stars going to Hugh Jackman and David Wenham."
4,"Lights, camera, action - action - action!","This movie barely sits still for more than a couple of minutes when it's another attack, another fight, another monster. That alone kept me from getting bored. Not the greatest plot, but monsters like these are still fairy tales. And yes, even in the midst of all the action I kept thinking to myself, ""How much did all the special effects cost?""Good movie for munching popcorn and having the time go by quick. Worthy of a sequel if they tone down the special effects and make more of a story. Think more like ""LoTR"". Good movie? I think so. A classic? ... Neh."
4,A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE SLOW IN PARTS,"I'm going to start by saying that the reviews giving Van Helsing 1 star are not accurate. It wasn't a spectacular film but it wasn't horrible. It's much better than some of the movies you could waste your time renting. Van Helsing delivers what it advertises: a movie about monsters that is action packed and interesting. It is a very well done action movie and I would reccomend renting it before buying it. The acting is mediocre but the acting is not what drives this film, its the action. Some parts can get slow and repetitive but overall its a fast paced movie. So, if you want to have a fun night and watch a cool action movie, rent it. If you are expecting to see a timless classic that you will cherish forvever go rent something from the classic section of the video store."
1,"its suppuse to be rally,really BAD!!!!!!!","VAN HELSING is a kind of movie thatt talks a lot,and puases a lot!!!!!its the same old borring DRACULA story.its a VAMPIRE movie!!!!!actully its not 1 star!!!!!its.........0 STARS!!!!!!!i would give this a F- and give it a 10 out of 100!!!!!!(100 is the best)instead of 4 in- a- half stars it should be a poor:2 star.it looked good......but then it came DOWN,UP,DOWN,DOWN,DOWN to the dephs of atlantis.im telling you....ITS A STUPID MOVIE!!!!!!ill choose an action movie/DVD"
4,Crossbow Hero,"Whoa momma-just by looking at the cover of this video you know you're in for some serious crossbow action! Van Helsing totally shoots the dickens out of all sorts of monsters. I saw this movie in a drive-in and for some reason only had the audio for the movie playing on the next screen (13 Going On 30) and it took me several minutes to figure out what was going on. If you can read lips though I don't see any reason why this would matter. Besides, crossbows speak louder than words.This movie is supposedly based on a true legend and it would be nice to see more kids named after this true hero in times like these."
4,Action packed with excellent special effects,"I am not sure why this movie was panned so much by so-called critics. Don't believe their whiny lies. No, it is not ""Citizen Kane"", but it is vastly entertaining and does achieve what every movie's goals should be: suspension of disbelief, loss of time awareness (unlike ""dogville"", the most aptly named movie yet), riveting action sequences in superb settings, excellent acting (unlike any DMX movie), mixed with superior state-of-the art special effects. Give this effort your time and attention. You won't be disappointed, unless, of course, you're the type who likes mumbling, syrupy Jennifer Lopez dramas with George Clooney trying to be overly cute or dripping off-the-wall performances with equally out-to-lunch plots like ""Entrapment"". This is a good movie. See it for yourself and make up your own mind. Don't let some overpriced newspaper underling do it for you."
1,Speechless,"As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman is, this production was a waste of time, space and money. Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves. The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly. It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's surprisingly close. Please don't waste your time with this film."
2,Made Me Go Weak With its Colossal Boredom,"Me and my four friends saw this movie at a theater cause we thought we'd see some action. We did see some action but the fact that this movie made me sleep with its absolutely non engrossing script made me feel I wasted my good money(and time) on something as small as this.I call it small because I fail to recollect one action sequence , one dialogue or one thing from this movie that I liked to the extent of saying it was better movie'd(my term) than some other.Please see: I felt quite disturbed at the money wasted on making this film. There are people who liked this and I respect them for it. But if there are some people as foolish as me who chose to go for this instead of some other hollywood flick STOP! I'd recommend any of the following movies instead of this sad tale of boredom. KING ARTHUR , TROY , Lord Of The Rings Two Towers...So Long , lovers :)"
2,Ugh!!!,"A very good cast is wasted in this ridiculous mess of a movie. While the production values are great, and the story is actually terrific, the outcome is horrible. Incredibly amateurish dialogue and overuse of CGI ruin what could have been a great film. This was originally planned as a sequel to Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, with Anthony Hopkins set to reprise his role of Van Helsing. Perhaps some of the quality of that original film would have benefited this absolutely pathetic attempt. Entertaining because of how bad it is, but truly forgettable. The audience was laughing for all the wrong reasons and that's never a good sign. One star for the plot, and another star for the casting."
3,it was some what good,THE MOVIE WAS O.K! I JUST LIKED THAT DRACULA HAD THREE BEAUTIFUL WIVES! EVERYTHING ALSE WAS O.K!
4,Perfect for Halloween,Has a lot of classic Halloween villains all wrapped around an interesting plot line. Very entertaining and exciting. Not overly scary. Good for kids and teenagers alike.
3,"Check hats, coats, crossbows and plausibilty at the door","""Van Helsing"" was visually exciting and thrilling, and a great movie to watch. Just don't actually try to ""think"" about it.Don't think about a secret religious organization that employs monks and mullahs together in the Vatican's basement. Ignore nonsense like fully automatic crossbows that operate on the same priniciple as an AK-47. Oh, don't worry, every rural village church as holy water on tap. Of course it's possible to keep a syringe in a bottle of acid and not damage it. And I learned that vampires copulate with each other and must be ovoviviparous!Yeah, Hugh Jackman really looks cool, Kate Beckinsale looks hot, and the special effects were fancy, but the plot was silly as could be. It just seemed like they wanted to gobble up every bit of gothic literature at once and flash it up. Best stick with the real classics over this one."
3,The Terminator of monsters,"I don't care what bad reviews are written about this movie.This movie was good in that it captured the monster movies of yesteryears and brought them into the 21st century in special effects.Violence you say,thats what you need with this type movie.Graphic violence is what this type of movie thrives on.Van Helsing could be much better if they had put more effort in the story(Had room to make it longer)more detail behind the plot.This story will continue. Hopefully Mr Jackman will play the part again.I can't think of anyone who could fill his shoes in this story.It seams the second movie out shines the first these days.I'm sure this will be true for this one too."
5,"Good characters, good story!","I like horror movies in general and this one was a pleasant change from the dark side of these kinds of movies. I liked the sense of humor in the character of the friar, and call me ""square"" but I liked the lack of sex and foul language that dominates alot of otherwise good horror flicks these days."
2,Wasting your time and money,The movie has a horribly weak plot and mediocre special effects. I am giving the extra star because I was interested enough to keep watching till the end. Don't make my mistake.
3,Mixed Feelings,"Whether or not you like this set may depend - as it does for me - on the chandos sound. It's too reverberant for my taste and I find, in some cases, it muddies up the texture and sounds a bit like an echo chamber. Sometimes Jarvi is really into the music (#5)and other times he seems bored and plows right through it. You're better off choosing individual performances."
3,do NOT get lost in the snow!,"this book is a collection of short stories relating to the arctic or cold,snowy places on earth. examples are:the yeti,abominable snowman,""the eagle""(a hot air balloon that went missing in 1897),ross marvin(what happened to him?),the northwest passage,and strange islands. this was ok. it is for young readers."
3,Not at all what I was expecting,"To be honest, we've only watched the first 3 cartoons so far.So why am I reviewing it?Only one of them was a felix cartoon, the second, popeye, the third an older one- not part of a series that I know of. Good older cartoons to be sure, but, not a Felix collection.The transfer quality is also not so good. (It may be that the film's decayed over time).Even though this is relatively inexpensive, I feel like I paid too much. I'd only buy this one in the bargain bin, and with the knowledge that you are not getting what the title would lead one to believe."
3,Once Upon A Time: Behind The Fairy Tale of Princess Grace,"This shows the more human side of royalty, and the troubled times of Princess Grace. At times the book got a little detailed on events and places, but it was still a very interesting read. I would definately recommend this book if you are interested in the Rainier family or if you enjoy a good autobiography."
5,Excellent Read,"This book is very well done and I loved it, though it might be just a tad partial to Grace Kelly. Still, well worth reading."
2,Once Upon a Time: Behind the Fairy Tale of Princess Grace and Prince Ranier,It is boring and repetitious. It appears the author didn't have enough background information to write a book about Grace Kelly.
5,The American Aristocrat who Became a European Princess,"Like Jackie Kennedy, Grace Kelly was born to a very privileged life in Philadelphia and was a debutant before she was a Hollywood Star. Cool, poised, aloof, and classy she was the blonde counterpart to Kennedy's dark mysterious allure. But her fairytale life had no happy ending and despite its glamour was all too human."
5,Awesome twinking lights!,"These wheels light up and entertain passers-by. I get SO many comments on them. Especially at night, but they can be seen during the day as well. The only short-coming is that I (sitting in the chair) cannot see their sparkling fun unless I am passing a low reflective window or mirror... Lots of fun, pimp your ride!"
1,dead out of the box,"My old laptop still works fine, I just wanted to give it some more memory. The price was right, the specs were exact for my machine. Would not boot up. Out of box failure. Either bad parts or it is not 533 Mhz memory. My old memory still works.Oh another thing, at the same time I upgraded my wife's newer laptop with memory from Crucial. Worked like a charm."
1,this thing does not work and i want my money back,how do I get my money back I pluged It in and my computer would not turn on
5,THE BEST!,"i've used tons of different products, this one is by far the best one. lasts a really long time and looks great! its a wonderful no mess product.the only drawback, i can't find it in any local stores. so i must buy it here."
2,Not worth your time,"The author makes a few useful suggestions, but for the most part I found this book to be a waste of time. The author obviously knows very little about anxiety. One of his suggestions to combat test anxiety is to grab hold of the seat of your desk and pull on it until the feelings of anxiety lessen. He convieniently overlooks many obvious causes of anxiety, choosing only to list the ones he feels can be alleviated through the use of his methods."
1,Not as advertised!,"The product was advertised as ""FULL SCREEN"" and was not! It was letter-boxed and viewed very small on my TV screen. This constitutes false advertising in the strictest sense! Very disappointed!"
2,Cute but over the top,I am an event designer and love making any room beautiful. I thought these pictures were beautiful but possible a little over the top. I don't recommend buying the book. It's wasn't worth paying full price.
1,It's easy,"Why do they fight? It's quite simple.It is a fight between one who wishes to exist (Israel) and those who seek to destroy it (Arab and Islamic world). Nothing more, nothing less."
3,The failure of the monarchy in Brazil.,"The author's analysis of why the ruling family of Portugal failed in implanting the monarchy in Brazil. Some of the subject matter includes the loss of support from the armed forces and the abolition of slavery as keys to loss of support for the monarchy and the fall of Dom Pedro II.Dom Pedro was indeed a popular monarch and very much appealed to the common people. However these were not the people pulling the strings in Brazil. Planters upset with the loss of their property (slaves) and generals upset with his decisions made the throne unstable. Dom Pedro II was a liberal, well intentioned monarch, but proved unable to pass on his throne.I gave the book only three stars because of Haring's dry analysis. It should have been more interesting."
1,dont be suckered,worst book i ever bought. thought (because of the HIGH price) it might be something. its less than cartoons made by a bunch of freshmen...
3,My only complaint,"As a yacht delivery captain, I have owned a couple of these units. I use them for GPS data thru my laptop utilizing Nobeltec marine navigation programming. As a GPS sensor, the unit performs well. However, the weak link in the unit is the DC power receiver. It is protected from the eliments by a small rubber plug which, when removed to plug in the charging cord, it easily lost. I mean, the plug is SMALL. There is no teather or keeper attached to the unit body and this leads to corrosion and subsequent breakage of the power pole (pin). On my most recent yacht delivery thru Central America, the pin broke and I had to break open the unit and hard-wire the DC cord directly to the DC power supply to complete my mission. Other than this, I like the unit. [...]."
4,GPS receiver for Palm PDA,I use this the Garmin GPS 10 in combination with a Palm Tungsten T5 for car-navigation. The bluetooth interface works well. It sometimes takes a few minutes before the receiver can determine the GPS-position.
4,Good Product,Search for Garmin Mobile 10...Do not waste your time with this product instead...The only pro. that product has over mobile 10 is the magnetic mount capability...
4,Favorite book,This is very tedious for a novel. Actually this is the best history of the subject I have found. i would recommend this to the person interested in code analysis.
5,Journey Into Eternity,Grant Jeffrey is an accomplished bible scholar who presents prophecy and world issues in a manner that is easy to read and understand.
5,silicone wisk,"excellent wisk to use on teflon coated pans. I am pleased with the product. Good price for the wisk, easy to clean"
5,Well Done!,Well packed and arrived in a timely fashion. Everything as expected. A pleasure to do business with.
5,For all the same reasons,See review of Let Every Nation Know. Reason for ordering this book is to go back and look at our history with much older eyes and with more understanding.
5,"No doubt, THE BEST","I order these for my Mom all the time and I've tasted them. They are moist and delicious. This is what a coffee cake shoud be, the standard for all coffee cakes! I can't say enough about this product. I'm not a ""sweet eater"", but these are not overly sweet and are just wonderful!!!"
1,Very turned off by misogyny,"The first chapter has Lovejoy hitting a woman twice and locking her in his bathroom. His his attitude towards her and others is quite misogynistic.He drives a woman in a car and she chatters as ""women will do"" - the narrative is in first person and he hits every typical misogynist point in the first chapter. I soldiered on for a while for the story, but then at some other point this unpleasant feature returned.Really ticked me off, because I thought these would be good books, given the TV series being interesting. This Lovejoy is such a horrible person, it's impossible to care what great finds he makes."
2,Playful poetry not proper to prose,"Page 3: ""Through skeins of rain as fine as angel hair...the gray-green quartzite cobblestones, polished to a sterling standard by the rain...""A corny plot woven into 650 pages of this stuff (or 16 CD's if you're unfortunate enough to hear such clumsy alliteration spoken). Koontz has done much better when he tried much less."
4,consentration is key...,"This book is very involved but yet is a page turner. I am a major fan of dean Koontz and i would reccommend this book to his other fans. At first it seems nothing makes sense until it all ties in together. After you fit the puzzle pieces into place you are on the edge of your seat to read what could possibly happen next. You need to pay attention to all the people who have a role in this book. Its full of chaos and magic but on a spirtual level. Not a God sort of spirtual, but more on the terms of help from beyond. I supposed you describe it as Angels. The evil within in the pages of this book is pure malice. Definitly not for the faint of heart. A very good book to get you thinking and take to another realm."
5,You won't be able to put it down!,"This is one of the best Koontz's books yet. I truely enjoyed it. As many of his other books, plot manages to bring up a number of important and sometimes scary social issues. But don't let it scare you - you won't be bored! It's all done as a part of entertaining and intriguing plot. I am not going to pretend to be a critic or bore you with 10 paragraph summary of the book, just take my word for it - the book is great. If you enjoyed DK's other books, such as Dark Rivers of the Heart or False Memory, you will not be disappointed. Thank you Mr. Koontz for once again brining us hours of enjoyment!"
5,koontz has done it again.,"its surprised me when the Face came out. just early this winter By the Light of the Moon was released but koontz just zooms through his wrighting. it amazes me how fast he writes and even though it is incredibly fast, he writes with great talent. once again he has published a book with one hell of a plot. It was an awesome read."
4,Extremly good! But not as scary & shocking as others,The Face was an excelent Book by Koontz! Although I was expecting Moloch (sp) to be a little more horrifing like some of the charecters in his other books I still found the plot thrilling and chatching...Although it was not one of those books where you start and can't put it down...it was still worth 4 stars...the last one is gone to the wind for the lack of scary monsters ;-)
2,I didn't like The Face,"This is my third Dean Koontz read, but had it been my first it probably also would have been my last. There's no question this author can string words into phrases that are stunninglylyrical and insightful. Or that he can capture a readers attention with a fresh, intriguing premise. And even though his characters are so intellectually fleshed out, meticulously revealed through their heads rather than their hearts, they often, ultimately have great soul. But in this book, I was sadly dissappointed in all these areas-except maybe for the initial premise. Soon into this story, I found myself wondering about who was who, what was real or imagined, what was important. I kept having to go back, wondering if I missed something, hoping it would all become clear in the middle or at least in the end. It never did. At least to me. With it's cool title and inside -cover rave reviews I expected something great. But in this case, the juice wasn't worth the squeeze."
2,A Mess,"The Face by Dean Koontz is a mess of a novel, but has enough redeeming qualities to see it through to the end. Ethan Truman is head of security for the ""Face"", an extremely popular Hollywood actor. He begins receiving threats from a murderous anarchist that threaten not only the Face, but also his family. At about the same time, several characters experience supernatural dreams and visions.The characters and their environments are described so intracately, that the story becomes tedious at times. At well over 600 pages, whole chapters could have been chopped out of this book. However, the story is so odd, so bizarre, that one must finish this book to see how Koontz ties it all together at the end."
3,Good book but not as good as other Koontz books,"Although I really liked this one I have to say that I though Koontz slipped a notch here. The pacing is off in several places and the usual flawless story intermingling just doesn't work in a few spots.I would give examples, but I would have to give away part of the book. I will just say this: if you are new to Koontz you may not have a big problem with the book and will probably enjoy it. But if you are a long time fan I think you might be a little disappointed.On the plus side the vivid descriptions for which DK is famous are everywhere. I doubt he could write a book without them. If you enjoy word imagery this book won't let you know in that department.By the by, I would still recommend the book just be prepared to be a little let down if you have come to expect perfection from Koontz as I have."
2,built to nothing,The begining of this book started strong and mysterious. As I read further I realized the story had no real depth and lacked in many ways. The ending was weak and I really felt I wasted my time on a 600 page novel.
2,Gave up after 200 pages,"I acutally cannot believe I waded through 200 pages. I like Dean Koontz-usually. I liked Lightning, Strangers and Phantoms very much. I kept reading hoping that this book was going to get better. It didn't. I had other books waiting to read. I soon didn't care about the characters any more. I will not give up on Koontz however!"
3,"Great Book, Poor Reader",I find the story very interesting as I do most of Dean Koontz's books. This one however suffers from poor reading on the part of Dylan Baker. Voice characterizations all run together and the voice of Dylan Baker is hard to listen to for extended periods of time.
4,Good Fric'in Read,"The Face won't inspire you to pass it amongst your family and friends, but it is an enjoyable read. Wait for a stormy weekend, light a fire, relax and enjoy."
3,Gets Better Later On,"At first this book was quite easy to put down, but it got better towards the end as the climax of Corky's plan came about and we wondered how Ethan, Dunny, and Hazard would thwart it. I have read every single Dean Koontz book in print and it seems that the older he gets the more philosophical he's become, and even seems as if he is tired of writing things that contribute too much to the clear and persistent evil we see in post-September 11th America. Those customers who cite this as the greatest novel he ever wrote need to grab yourselves a copy of Watchers or Strangers and settle in for a long page-turning night of suspense. His books are now good, but I just can't work up the amazed excitement and wonder his previous novels conjured in me. All in all, though, it's decent and is worth the read if you hang in there until the planned kidnapping begins to truly unfold."
2,Not his best work,"For fans of his older stuff, this might not be the best choice. I plodded through it, only because it was Koontz. ""the husband"" and ""taking"" are much better examples of his current works.This book meanders about aimlessly for a while. I stopped reading it three times to read other stuff, and finally cmae back to it when I had nothing else to read. Characters are well formed, imagery is intense as always, but the plot left much to be desired until the final third of the book.Ended well - if you can make it to that point."
3,Good - till the end,"I have to agree with other reviewers who said this book started off fast, and very interesting, but the end was just way too predictable. Koontz really had me for about 75% of the book, and then it seemed to all unfold well before the end.The weaving of horror, anarchy, ghosts, detectives, drug dealers, and movie stars was a lot, and it made for interesting fast paced reading. But, again the end was way too predictable. Koontz is the king of this genre, but this book only gets a solid 'B'Joseph Dworak"
2,Drudgery,"Thanks to Publisher's Clearing House for revealing 85% of the story. Now I don't have to finish the book. I'm a huge fan of this author, but he really dragged this one out way too far. And where's the usual strong female presence? Where's the strong connection/empathy for the protagonist? Which one IS the protagonist? I'm a third of the way through and have started ""skimming"" just to get through all the excess verbal baggage. I love his writing style, but this is over the top. But, I won't stop buying his books!"
5,From Fear to Freedom: Living as Sons and Daughters of God,"This book is absolutely amazing. God truly speaks through her writing! If you are a woman who struggles with feeling like she doesn't ""measure up,"" hates being ""out of control,"" read this book! There is GRACE for God's children and there is acceptance in HIM! He loves us and is with us at ALL times!"
5,The most life changing book I've ever read.,"From Fear to Freedom is one very brave womans story of her life. She lets you in on a decade of her struggles and realizations. She is found by a gracious God who shows her that she can live like his daughter, knowing that he loves her and will rescue her. His love sets her FREE and reading this book has brought me to a place where I have been set free as well. Free from sin, free from guilt, free from feeling sorry for myself and free to love and be loved. I was amazed at every turn as I felt like she was reading my thoughts. READ THIS BOOK and reread it and give it to a friend and study it and have coffe with them and talk about it - it will change you. If you've ever felt ""trapped"" this book will show you the only true escape - UP!"
4,Holy $%!#,"Wow!!! I did not know what to expect from this album when I ordered it. It was highly toted by pitchfork and sung entirely in Swedish, so I ordered it with some nervous anxiety, unsure of what I was about to receive. But, I've got to say (like pretty much everyone else is), this is a great album. The word psychedelic does it no justice. The music is out of this world, completely unique. Although it took a little while to get used to the singing, the music really grabs hold of you right off the bat. The songs are complex and often delve into folk, free-jazz and prog-rock. Even if the meaning of the lyrics are not clear, one thing is: This is the work of a brilliant mind."
5,very nicely done,"GREAT CD very impressed with the cd, wonderful voice and emotional being put into the impressive cd. A good buy for all to enjoy like I have."
4,Great fun!,"Never forget: ""MANY ARE CALLED, FEW ARE CHOSEN!"" This film should be required viewing for all wannabe artists, actors, musicians, athletes, etc. Could save them YEARS of grief. For most wannabes it's much, much better to have a decent-paying day job, and pursue their creative dreams strictly for their own satisfactions. ... in other words, F.T.W. Remember, too: So-called artistic strivings and sufferings are self-imposed. All the TALENT in the world won't help if you lack CONNECTIONS and LUCK. Just some friendly, fatherly advice. PS: Malkovich was great in this film!"
5,"Nelson, 4th edition, Fishes of the World.","This is a wonderful book. I should have bought and enjoyed earlier editions. Easy to read, and an excellent source of even local information. I find the line drawings much easier to use than some who have complained about them. The line drawings direct my attention to the critical areas of the fishes."
2,Not enough trivia,"This book contains too much extraneous text and not enough trivia. There is some interesting and unusual trivia in the book, though. Some of it seemingly would only be known by someone like this author, who seems to be a stereotypical 60's-era Hollywood insider.Another word of caution: the author (for some unknown reason) seems intent upon injecting his own personal views into the book. The most telling example of this is when he refers to would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley, Jr. as a ""bad shot."" That tells you all that you need to know about the political views that the author sneaks in throughout the book."
2,Trivia with a left-wing bent...,"This is a slightly different kind of trivia book in that it is not just a ""question and answer"" book. It provides some text to go along with individual topics, and also, unfortuantely, an apparent political agenda. The author eveidently finds it necessary to intersperse some of his 60's-esque politcal and anti-Christian religious views into the book. It seems like a book written by a stereotypical Hollywood insider.That said, the actual trivia in the book is not too bad. The reader gets the chance to learn some things that someone who is not an aged hippie would not otherwise know."
3,Unassuming musings.,"Josh Rouse is similar artist to Freedy Johnston, releasing quiet alt.country/pop/rock gems full of meditations on love, lost love and other small town vignettes that go largely unnoticed by music consumers. Rouse's sophomore release 'Home' is a record that doesn't so much scream to be heard, as it does gently coax the listener to enjoy it for what it is. Rouse himself has suggested this would be a good album to cook a meal to - which is a good appraisal as there is certainly an intented air of domestic pondering here. 'Home' starts very promisingly with the infectious (but not very funny) 'Laughter', the pretty 'Marvin Gaye' and the impassioned 'Directions'. Elsewhere the album is wistful and pleasant but trails off a bit toward the end, rarely grabbing the attention of the listener or reaching the heights of it's predecessor 'Dressed Up Like Nebraska'. Nevertheless this is a good record from one of America's best songwriters."
3,See Under the Banner,Be aware that I have not yet read this book but only the present reviews( it is on order from the library). However Jon Krakauer's Under the banner of Heaven recounts the polygamy still practiced by jack mormons(a few perhaps) and tries to explain why young women submit to this practice.
2,"Good list, insulting to some readers","The reading list at the end of the book had good suggestions but, to get there, you had to read through all the political bashing by the author. I guess he thinks Christians and Republicans don't read to their kids. So NOT true. Instead of being a positive voice on reading, the author used the book as a soap box to bash conservatives. Not what I expected. The author was arrogant, insulting and rude. I'd reather read ""Honey for a Child's Heart."""
3,A little too opinionated.,"Although I am enjoying this book, I think the Author writes too many of his own personal opinions about the topic of reading to children. I would prefer a book that give facts, and leaves out the writer's personal opinions and commentaries. My 21 month old daughter loves books and asks me to read to her constantly, which is why I purchased this book. I love books too. So I was hoping to purchase a book that basically listed quality titles to read to children. This book offers more of the Author's opinions than it offers information on good books to read.As a side note, since kids are all different, some children may never take to this kind of reading because they gravitate to something else....like music, sports, art, etc. That is not a crime; it makes the world of people interesting."
1,CHEAPLY MADE,"As usual with Hot Wheels toys, this one is cheaply and poorly made. It takes 2 children to play it, the cars are difficult to line up to supposedly shoot through the hoop, it never does. The boys just got it for Easter and are already bored with it. Another one for the closet."
4,"compelling, yet flawed","I have read all of Colin Harrison's books, and had eagerly awaited this one. Although the pace is just as driving and the characters as interesting, the violence - expecially the scenes with the drill - seemed gratuitous to me. I know Harrison is drawn to the dark underbelly of society, but in the past any violence or kinky sex was tied to character development. Here Harrison seems intent on providing grisly scenes of torture simply for shock value. As another reader suggested, you would do well to read ""Bodies Electric"" and ""Manhattan Nocturne"" before this book."
1,Read at your own risk!,"I whole-heartedly agree with a previous reviewer who described the experience of reading this book as ""time in my life which I can never have back."" I wish I had read that review before buying this book. This is the first novel by Mr. Harrison I have had the opportunity to read, and will be the last.The scenes of graphic torture spread throughout the book are visceral and intense, but at least seem to be relative to the story until the end. The way he concludes his narrative is disturbingly pointless and callus, but worst of all unbelieveable. He subjects the reader to some of the most disturbing imagery I can recall, and for no good reason.Do yourself a favor and don't bother."
2,Violence Du Jour,"I read the whole thing, and wished I hadn't. The writing is great. The situations are convincing, except for the killer sex. The characters are consistent and generally avoid stereotypes. But I felt exploited by the use of violence that seemed entirely prurient, violence solely for the sake of sensation. I did not learn anything from the way the characters dealt with it, largely because they and their grim circumstances were foreign to my own experiences, and probably those of most other readers. I want to encounter people whom I recognize or imagine I might meet. I want to feel like their experiences might be my own. There's a lot of shock value in this book, but it only left me feeling used."
2,Page turning trash,"While Afterburn is extremely well written, is a real page turner, and has fascinating passages, the book is morally repugnant. Most of the characters belong in the federal prison in Marion, Illinois. The message? Crime pays if you are smart enough. I usually like ""dark"" books, and I have very liberal views about literature. However,after finishing this review, I am going to through this garbage in the trash. Physical torture should not be elevated to ""literary"" status."
2,Unrealistic Sex/Unrealistic Plot,"The book was definitely riveting . . . but for all the wrong reasons. You know how they say water seeks it's own level? Well, now we know why this author is married to Kathryn Harrison . . . the author of ""The Kiss,"" the woman who had an affair with her own father. The sex scenes are too far out to be believed. This author has a very strange perspective on the female orgasm, but he apparently found a woman to marry whose sexual outlook is as screwed up as his own. And I so hate novels that have characters spell out all of the the ""scams"" by narrative to another person. The book held my interest, but disappointed in the end."
2,Good story line,"Although it is obvious fairly early on where this story is headed, the links and connections provide intrigue. Although Very much told from a male perspective, the ""paroled"" female lead is one step ahead of all the other characters. The heir craving business man, owner of a multimillion dollar company seems to have one employee in the US. Listened to BOT so unable to skip over the excruciating (torture) and repetitious (counting diapers)sections which detracted somewhat from the story line."
1,"book should be called ""burn this before you read""",this is a truly useless book (unless you want to use it for kindling - but then make sure you use the paperback version). the author invests so much of his efforts (and therefore the readers' efforts) for in-depth characterizations of each of his main characters which then have little relevance (or improbable relevance) on the events that happen in each characters' lives. the result is an inane book that is completely improbable.i won't tell you what the book is about - the other reviewers have done a wonderful job describing the story. my only goal here is to prevent another reader from wasting their valuable time.
4,The Very Best of Ed Ames,"I have always been of fan of Ed Ames, and this CD is the reason why.He has an exception voice, and the songs are all classics."
5,Great stuff!,"I thought this book was really great. I got annoyed that my wife didn't use it, but I think she's gonna give it to a friend."
1,OVER A MONTH AND STILL WAITING,I order this for my friend who just got Married and I still have not received the book. OVER 1 month and counting. This is absolutely ridiculous. I will never buy from this seller again!
1,Fifty years at the Craps Tables,"""Fifty years at the Craps Tables"" by Mr. Stuart is NOT a book about craps. It is ramblings about Las Vegas and various casinos. Apparently, telling stories about casinos and his previous play, mostly all wins, of course, is suppose to be a book on craps. Boring. His craps system?...""Play the pass line and take full odds. After the come out roll, make a come bet and take full odds."" That is the entire book! What a waste of my time and money. I recommend this book for the circular file!"
1,Thanks for nothing Amazon..,"Well, I just got this in the mail today, only to find out that it is the battery pack for the larger PSP and not the PSP Slim. (2000 model) So I got online today, did a search and couldn't find the item that I ordered on this site, because the ""PSP Slim and Lite charger and battery pack"" isn't what this item is called anymore. Thanks for being retarded and not getting the description right when it came out. VERY MISLEADING! Well, that's the last time I will shop from Amazon..."
4,Cute game but it's still just checkers and tic-tac-toe,"Bought this for my granddaughter who comes to my house after school for her and I to play. It has a very cute theme but for the money I think I should have just picked up an inexpensive checkers game. It would have still taught her the basic game and I think we would have had just as much fun. You can also, as you all probably know, do tic-tac-toe with paper and pencil."
2,Re: Color muting!,"This is not a critique of the film itself. That's been admirably done by all the above interested parties, pro and con. I've got to put my two cents in about this DVD's visual quality. As a film buff, I was eager to see Mr. Badham's original color concept. If the transfer were bright and clear, I think I would have been well satisfied. But beware!...Most key scenes are so dark as to make the viewer squint in frustration trying to make sense of the visuals. Worse yet - The ""bright"" scenes appear to have been photographed through a misty, gray cloud. If you truly admire this film, please think twice about purchasing. Rent it instead, if you must."
3,"Good Film, No Features Though. Dracula Collectors Rejoice.","Frank Langella stars as the doomed Count and does a good job. Dracula leaves his homeland and begins to terrorize a new community. He falls for his real estate agent's love Mina. It is up to Mr. Harker and his comrades including Dr. Van Helsing to stop him, both from stealing away Mina, and from spreading his vampiric plague to the world.This version of Dracula (much like Coppola's), is more of a dark romance than a horror film.With no features whatsoever it's hard to justify purchasing this DVD. It is however, the only release of Langella's Dracula on the market on DVD and I don't see a newer release coming soon. The film's picture and sound are fine, so for just the film it is a good purchase."
1,major letdown,"Reviewer was on honeymoon at St Michael's island offshore Cornwall, SW England, which served as the set for Castle Dracula while the exteriors were filmed. The evenings included watching the count's carriage being raced up and down the beach by sinister coachmen obviously under instruction to whip up publicity. So we faithfully trooped in to see the film on its first night and regreted it. A major letdown after the book, and a letdown as a film. None of the beautiful exteriors, spectacular sundowns or landscape of the Cornwall coast make any appearance, while much effort is wasted on fake atmosfere; and as for the acting, observing the furniture had more merit. Sorry."
2,"2 stars for DVD, the movie gets a 4","John Badham's ""Dracula"" is still among my favorites of the Dracula legend. Frank Langella added new dimensions to the characters, a smoothness that made the vampire more scary, though just as romantic. Terrific movie and Lucy will creep you out forever. But the DVD treatment is not so wonderful - rather than keeping the contrast deep with real blacks and whites, it looks more washed out than authentic. This may be what the director wanted but it looks too underlit - not the sight of near B&W that was long rumored. I love the movie and will keep the DVD but prepare to be disappointed by the wanting picture quality. For the rest of us, this Dracula is far superior to Coppola's over-the-top fang fest."
3,"Good, But Not The Best Screen Version Of Bram Stoker's Terrifying Tale.","i just saw this version for the first time, and it's not bad, but it's not my favourite adaptation of the novel. That honour goes to Bram Stoker's Dracula, released in 1992, as it's the closest to the book. I don't see why this film version is rated R, as there's nothing overtly graphic, except at the beginning, and even then, it's mild compared to crap like Scarface (1983). Frank Langella, Sir Laurence Olivier and Donald Pleasance were spot-on as Dracula, Doctor Seward and Professor Van Helsing. Purists beware: the story here has been changed even more so than in the 1931 version, which is quite good, but everyone has their preference as to which version of Dracula is the best."
5,Rich in atmospehere and suspence,"I remember I watched this movie when I was about 10 years old, and it scared the crap out of me. Mainly because of the two female vampires, Lucy and Mina. Mina has to be the most frightening vampire I have ever seen on film.The excellent music by John Williams, gives this movie an extra dimension to it. Frank Langella, last seen as the editor in chief of the Daily Planet in ""Superman Returns"", gives a strong performance as the lovesick and bloodthirsty count Dracula. The late Donald Pleaseance and Laurence Olivier, plays Dr. Seward and Dr. Van Helsing, Draculas greatest enemies.To sum it up: Great actors, scary vampires, rich gothic atmosphere and a great musical score by John Williams, makes this production from 1979, one of the best Dracula movies ever."
2,GREAT FILM BUT SHAME THERE IS NO COLOUR!,"I can't believe that UNIVERSAL have messed the DVD up twice! The last release about 4 years ago had only about 10% of the colour left & that print was deleted in 2001. Now, over 3 years later, they re-release the DVD in good new packaging, clearly showing on the cover that the film was made in full colour (from the stills on it), good extras, but with the film itself in BLACK & WHITE!!! Come on UNIVERSAL HOME VIDEO, get your act together please!"
3,"Best Drac ever, but not best DVD","I must have seen this film a dozen times in the theatres when it first came out, and probably know most of the dialogue! Frank Langella was every woman's dream as Dracula, the Hunk. Even though the screenplay didn't accurately reflect the novel, it was nonetheless engaging, beautifully filmed and acted, and parts are truly frightening. It's one of my favorite films of the genre.But alas, I am so disappointed with the DVD. I don't know if I'm the only one, but the copy I bought is very washed out color-wise. I distinctly remember the film in beautiful, ""living"" (ahem)color. The DVD was almost in sepia tone, except for the infamous ""Bat Love"" scene. Has anyone else noticed this? Curious minds would love to know!"
1,Not in Good Shape,"When purchasing this book I wanted to get a NEW copy of the book therefore I paid the ""new"" price. When receiving the book, I was disgusted by the condition of the book....it has punctured holes in, is smashed on every edge and the first 5-6 pages the bottom is torn off.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!"
1,Rockmount doesn't make a vest?,"Ordered this because Rockmount is still USA made. Instead, seller shipped a Cripple Creek vest made in China, a significantly less expensive vest found for $14.99 elsewhere. Returned the vest to seller, who refunded my money because ""Rockmount doesn't make a suede vest.""I see the listing is still here, you are forewarned not to buy unless you want a cheaply made China vest instead."
5,Andy Griffith ACTOR,This film proved Griffith's dramatic acting ability. It was so far removed from the sheriff and lawyer roles he later portrayed. This film is a classic with excellant co-stars. It is well worth revisiting or seeing for the first time.
2,NO BETTER THAN A HAIR PIN,"I was imagining at least the smaller end to be thinner, but it turned out to be just like the closed end of a hair pin. If your skin gets clean by scraping with the closed end of a hair pin, then you might as well use that instead of spending $9 to get the same result. I mean the quality looks good, almost too good and bulky for a comedone extractor. But hey, unless your're wanting to clean up a grown blackhead,you probly wont get much out of this tool."
1,A ripoff!,"It only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is NOT the solution for ending blackheads/enlarged pores. Using this ""extractor"" is equal to using one's fingers to squeeze out imperfections, which may produce very temporary results, but is ultimately fruitless. Those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep-cleaning instead, which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation."
1,I Hate This Thing!,"I think the effectiveness of this product may depend on pore size. I have small pores and this does nothing to extract blackheads or clogged pores. Using this is painful and damaging to the skin. When I use this, I just get a huge red welt on my face from pressing very hard in an effort to get something to come out. The loops on this are broad and flat. I think that the loop covers too much surface area to apply sufficient pressure to a specific pore. I have had better results from doing the same thing with fine-tipped tweezers."
5,Great product,This is a great product! I bought it for my son who is starting to have skin issues. This product doesn't cause huge bumps or swelling and he can do it himself.
3,Unsatisfying,"The tool will take older blackheads out, but the newer ones and pimples it does not get out at all. An okay buy. :/"
4,Bye Bye Pore Strips!,"This is a good product. It's amazing to see how much gunk you have in your skin! I never need to buy pore strips again! I use this tool to get all of my blackheads out. However, I find the flat side (for blackheads) rather difficult to use anywhere on my face except my nose, but it's not impossible. Ditch the strips and try this product!"
5,Great Product!,"Gives me that little extra boost of energy I need! Taste is not too bad either, kind of messey if you do not know how to handle a dropper."
4,One of the best pop dance songs of 2002 in UK,"The cd is a compilation of 42 hit songs of 2002 in UK featured Sophie Ellis Bextor, Bubba Sparxx, PPK, Kylie Minogue, Blue, Ian Van Dahl, Afroman, Gorillaz, So Solid Crue and etc."
2,Um... Credentials lacking,I would not write a book that deals with physics as I am not a physicist.I would not write a book about catahoula leopard dogs as I've never actually seen one.I would not write a book about how to be a Godly single woman since I'm married with four kids.I would not purposefully read a book about married life by a woman who has never been married- even if she bases her information on the bible. Because I could skip her book and read the bible.Does it bother ANYONE that the woman spouting off marital advice has NEVER BEEN MARRIED?
4,Good Routines,Ginger and Fred never disappoint and this is no exception. Other reviewers have covered this so well. The VD quality is excellent on ours.
4,She-Ra Wrath of Hordak,A great series of episode on this dvd. The only problem with the Amazon on line listing is that being marked IMPORT they don't list if it Region 1 or another Region dvd that might not play on Region 1 DVD players.
4,They taste pretty good,"Pringles Cheezums Potato Crisps just do cut it. They are good on my breath too. Honestly, they taste pretty good. I would get them again."
5,It's a small ring binder....,"The Wilson Jones Basic Round Ring Vinyl Binder, 8.5 x 5.5 Inch Size, 1 Inch Rings, 175 Sheet Capacity, Black is..... A Black, 175 sheet capacity binder with 1 inch rings covered in vinyl and made my Wilson Jones.Umm, it's got a little pocket on the inside of the front and back covers and is made in the USA.Does a good job for a low price."
4,The lovely Reed,"This is clearly the best of the current crop of rod building books. It could do with an index (ther isn't one!), updates on components (The Golden Witch, Bellingers - he carries **everything**, not just reel seats), and additional information on critical processes (straightening glued up rods, filing, scraping, sanding a blank, wrapping, etc.). Overall, though, if you are going to build a first rod this ought to be your first purchase!"
3,Good - while it lasted,When i got this stand I was very satisfied with it.A couple weeks later the stand broke in halfPros:Adjustable height and left rightCons:Skinny music holderBreaks
5,Tracks are...,1. Kansas City - Little Willie Littlefield 2. Kansas City - Joe Williams 3. Kansas City - The Everly Brothers 4. Kansas City - Peggy Lee 5. Kansas City - Trini Lopez 6. Kansas City - Wilbert Harrison 7. Kansas City - Little Milton 8. Kansas City - Lou Rawls 9. Kansas City - Bill Haley And His Comets 10. Kansas City - The Leiber-Stoller Big Band
5,Stronger than expected,"I purchased these hex bits for the smaller drive size because I didn't have room for the 3/8 drives that I had.I had one bolt that I could not loosen with the ratchet, so I used a breaker bar. I broke the first extention I used but didn't break or round off the hex. These are very strong and better than expected."
2,hard to finish,i have not finished the game stuck on level where you have to fallow the guy to the secret meating don't know what to do aftery you kill the guy in the meating room and get to the room that's all red and get to the door how do you get the security door open hope fully you can help
5,logan lives forever,"Syphon filter is one of the best replayable games that, unlike other sequels, keeps getting better. 1 was good, 2 was brill and 3 is fanomenal, worth every penny. I seriosly sujest this game to anyone!"
5,Great cases,These cases are small and hold up to 4 games. The fit quite nicley into my travel bag for my Nintendo DS and work perfectly. About the only negative is that you do have to be a little careful opening the cases for sometimes the game will fly out. My advice is to open them at home first and see for your self how they react to your opeing skills. Once you know how they work they are durable and compact.
5,Very Solid,"This case is great. It is the size of 2 DS game cases, and holds 12 games! This streamline my backpack quite a bit as I seem to like to have at least 6 games with my DS when I am out with it.The only complaint I could have about it is the plastic cartridge slots make it a little hard to get the games out. But, thats me complaining that it holds games to well. So thats nit picking isn't it."
1,Hard to get the games out!,The plastic sleeves are very tight and impossible for my son to get the games out. We had to cut some of the pockets to get them out. Nice case - just hard to use. We ended up taking out the plastic sleeves and just let the games roam free in there now...
3,Too big,"I don't know why no one makes a little metal spatula, just right for flipping a fried egg in a small pan. This one is better for burgers."
3,"Okay, but no great.","This book spends more than 2 CD's on a rescue mission to save George, which I think was too much time. I am saddened by the brave Steve Plank (main character from books 1-2)but happy that he was a believer. This book does not feature another battle between Nicolae and Micah, like book #9 did, but I wish it did."
1,Defective Product,"The item arrived promptly, but the rings in the address book cover do not close properly. There is a gap which allows the contents to come loose. The general quality of the item seems shoddy. Although not an expensive item, I expected better quality.I advise those looking for a refillable address book to look elsewhere than this product."
5,Very Nice,This is 120mm fan is great.Works very nice.Red LED looks very sharp.Being able to control the speed with a switch is also a plus.Great product.
4,Seems pretty good,"It's hard to get too excited about a replacement case fan for your desktop but this seems to be a pretty good 80 mm fan for the price. The fan is fairly quiet and is pretty flexible in terms of fan speed and power connections. There is a tiny switch that can be moved into 1 of 3 speed positions. Even on the highest fan setting, the fan isn't very loud. I cannot speak to the longevity of the product, but I would recommend this fan to anybody based on the built in options for the price."
4,"good fan, but not an exact replacement for the original Antec case fan","I bought this a replacement for a fan in my antec case, but there where some differences from the original case fan.1) The blades are clear rather than black which makes the LED effect brighter than the fan directly above it.2) The wire for the speed switch is only about 3 to 4 inches long as opposed to the original fan where the wire was about 8 inches. A big difference for accessing the switch after the installation. I thought seriously about splicing the wire, but decided that I always leave it on low anyway.Neither are deal breakers, but I know it's the kind of thing that will drive some people around the bend and should know them ahead of time. The fan itself: no problems"
4,Just what I needed.,"It was a little thicker than I anticipated, and I thought it wold blow a little harder, but it's an excellent deal for the price and I was very satisfied. It was just what I needed for my project."
4,Not the advertised fan,"While the two fans I ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly, they are not as advertised on Amazon's website. According to the specs on the site, they have a double ball-bearing design which last longer than normal fans. Be warned, these are NOT the Antec double ball-bearing fans, but the less expensive ones. Have contacted Amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately."
5,Great case fan.,This fan is quiet and easily installed and adjusted. It looks good and is very well made. I would recommend this to any pc builder either beginner or expert.
3,"Did job, but not DBB",I like the switch and being able to control the fan RPM. However this fan isn't double ball bearing as advertised. At least the one I received clearly wasn't.
2,Quiet... until it isn't,"Like the other reviewers say, this is a quiet fan even on high... until it isn't. Mine started to make quite a bit more noise on startup, presumably the early warning signs of bearing failure, and the fan is only a couple of months old. Replaced it with a StarTech fan that appears to be just as quiet but is, I hope, more durable."
1,Don't buy,These fans are very loud! Even when you set it on the lowest speed it hums louder than any fan i have ever used.
4,"Good case fan, good blue LED's.","I like this fan and the 4 blue LED's. It is bright enough without blinding you. I have it in the clear side window so as to be closer to the computer user. Therefore, I set it to low to keep noise down. The higher speed is noisy, but not as bad as the fan it replaced which was one speed. I thought this was 3 speed, all I could discern was Lo and Hi. But I like the Lo setting so all is good. Time will tell on longevity. Amazon used to ship quicker. I am not the only one that does not like the new UPS gives it to the USPS and then the Post Office delivers it system. It takes a few days longer. Amazon, be careful, we are noticing. And if the Feds or states say we all have to pay sales Taxes, some of your advantages will disappear."
5,The variable speed makes it a winner,"This fan replaced a cheap blue LED lit fan that lasted about two years before its bearings wore out and it rattled incessantly and stopped occasionally. I initially hooked the new fan up set on High and it was a little on the loud side, not awful but louder than the one it replaced (when it worked). I set the fan to the Middle setting and did notice a little less air movement but it still seemed sufficient and definitely quieter. Once I shut the case and powered the PC back up I monitored the system and the system temp stays at 40 degrees Celsius. When I had the failing fan in the case the temp would get up over 65 degrees Celsius and cause the over temp alarm to sound. So all in all I am happy with the fan, plus if I need more cooling I can always kick it up to High."
3,Antec Tricool fan,"Fan fit right into the antec case I have. Just snap out the old and snap in the new. It is a little noisy, however works great for the price."
3,Note: this is volume 1 of a 3 volume set,"This is volume 1 of a 3 volume set, covering Matthew, Mark, Luke, and apparently also James and Jude. It appears that amazon.com doesn't have the other two volumes, so unless you are interested only in the first part of the Gospels, you may find this volume a problem. Fortunately, amazon.co.uk carries all three volumes. Look for author first word = Calvin, title word = Harmony It won't be immediately obvious that the first volume is the same as this book, because the set is jointly published by Eerdmans and Paternoster. This is volume 1 from Eerdmans; amazon UK has all three volumes from Paternoster."
2,Not for everyone,"It is very difficult to get a decent scan without several tries for each page. With practice I was finally able to scan a flat document on a desktop, but the quality still wasn't great. The main reason I got this pen scanner, however, was to scan archives of very old documents bound into books. Since they're never completely flat, it is virtually impossible to get through a page without it shutting itself off. The manual suggests that for books you should start at the binding and scan left to right, instead of top to bottom, thereby creating a ""landscape"" document. But guess what - the scanner is only 8.5"" wide, so you can't capture a regular letter-sized document in landscape format. I think it's a great concept, but for limited applications. With improvements, and possibly a longer ""pen"", I think the product has a lot of potential."
5,Buy this book first if you are new to Exchange,"This book is concise, engaging, and informative. The author is clearly above par in his ability to define what is going on in the back ground of Exchange without boring you to death. And if your not familiar with the internals of POP3 and SMTP messenging, theres some interesting hands on with Telnet. A MUST HAVE BOOK for anyone starting to learn Exchange."
5,Circulon 2 12 inch open French skillet,"Great product. I have been using Circulon for years and needed a bigger skillet. All the products are extremely durable, easy to clean and cook with even heat distribution."
4,Highly recommended by health informaticists,"I just attended the American Medical Informatics Assn. (AMIA)meeting and heard an outstanding presentation by Dr. Carter. Other panel speakers highly recommended his book. If the book is nearly as good as the talk, this will be money well spent."
5,Very nice flavor,I find that when I want to cheat on my diet that this is the bar to have.You get the candy flavored fix but its very filling so you dont have to have 3 of them.I highly recommend them.
3,Dr.Atkins Decadent Bars,Great taste but the price is too high for what is in the box. There should have been 10 bars for the price I paid and I don't intend to purchase them again. I'll try another website and see if I can find this product somewhere else.
5,"Atkins ""Endulge"" Caramel Nut Chew Bar","Our all time favorite low-carb treat, only net 2 carbs. When you're on a low-carb eating plan, there are few sweet snacks that hit the guilty free mark - this is our most sweet & chewy favorite. Not many retail places to buy these, so ordering online is a convenient and less costly way to keep them on hand."
1,Bars were all melted,"I received the bars recently and when I opened the first pack a couple days ago, the bars were melted. I checked a couple other packs, and they're all in various stages of melting. Not really happy about eating a coagulated glob of Atkins.UR"
3,Art Nouveau Tarot,"Very good graphics, which help a lot non-experts: each picture suggests meaning of the card. Pity that they are gloss-laminated, it greatly reduces their quality."
1,Junk,This is product is junk. The plastic is so flimsy and can break. They have more expensive (cap shaper) at lids for more $'s but i bought this one and wasted my $'s... ugh
4,Good clean hat.,"Only issues I have is it ruined my cap bend, but it cleaned the hell out of my hat and I can always re-bend it.Worth the money."
5,Ballcap Buddy,"Hubby has been wanting one of these for a long time. I made him happy! Now his bajillion hats can be ""perfect""."
4,Adam D Koenigsberg MD FACS,"This is an excellent text. I know Dr Nelson personally, and he and Dr Harley do an amazing job at describing important concepts in Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus. This is certainly an important part of the library of any pediatric ophthalmologist.Adam Koenigsberg MD FACS"
4,Nice tea,"I love Sleepy Time tea, I used to give it to my children, since it is caffeine free, as they grew up, it helped them warm up and fall asleep quickly.Just a little story and a small cup of warm tea, that was the routine especially in the winter. They are all grown now but I find that they are now serving it to my grand children and it is having the save effect.I still drink it between all the other teas I enjoy but this one is just a little more special."
3,2 miles not 25 miles,"While the two-way radios worked they only allowed for a 2 mile distance instead of the 25 mile distance advertised, which in our case was one of the main reasons this set was purchased."
1,What a waste of money,"These radio's are the worst! You cannot hear anything. It does not matter if you are 5 feet away from the other person or 100 feet. They look nice but that about covers it. I have no idea why they are still being sold and have not had a recall.On the up side. I called Motorola and they are aware of the problem. They are sending me new ones and a different ""better model"". They are also sending me return postage so I can send them these awful things back.I will let you know how the new ones are."
3,"Hmmm... ok, I guess...","Not bad... but not great either...It works perfectly with no obstructions, buildings, hills, etc... Quite flakey once you're no longer in the same vicinity...Havent compared it to the cheaper options but I bought this one because of its range... I cant imagine the cheaper items performing any worse."
1,Motorola POS,"Wow, what junk. These worked fine for about two weeks, then worked intermittently and are now dead. Now comes the hassle of sending them back to Motorola and probably paying more to have them fixed than buying new ones. These never should have made it off the drawing board."
2,"Terrible Sound Quality, Cheap Housing","I was immediately disappointed with the sound quality of these radios. It was frequently very difficult/impossible to understand what the other person was saying (confirmed in both directions). This wasn't an issue of being out of range or choppiness or such. Simply, it sounds like the voice is digitized and degraded. I have an FCC license and have owned numerous Motorola radios over the years. This set was a real disappointment. A radio that can ""ideally"" communicate over such a great distance is useless if you can't understand what the other person is saying -- even from a very short distance away.Furthermore, the housing of these radios lacks durability. The rugged rubberized bumpers that served to protect the former models is gone -- just cheap-feeling plastic now."
3,Frustrating,"Compared to the last 3 which were great stories in themselves. This final book, just left me unfulfilled and frustrated, it seemed like such political lecturing. I appreciate the sentiment, but it just seemed to harp on. Unf I wished that McDonald's editors did as Abgail's editior probably rightly did also - to withhold a novel from publication. It wasn't that I wasn't ready for the insights, it was that it was such a departure from the last 3 that it just wasn't up to par."
2,Poor,"The Head is made with very poor material, instead of one clean circular piece of aluminum holding it, it consists of two overlapping pieces that prevent the head from going onto the instrument. So, not only was it poor quality, the head did not even fit. The best thing about the whole process was the shipping, it got here in 3 days, not bad. But overall, it was a poor decision buying from here."
3,Come Back John!,I was disappointed not only in the sound but in the selections on this tape. There were too few lively tunes and too many slow ballads. This just is not in the same class as the first fabulous recording with John McDermott. Come back John!
5,Excellent,"I'm not Irish and I'm not a fan of Irish music per se, but I am a fan of these gentlemen. They -- particularly Anthony Kearns -- could sing the phone book and I would pay to hear it. This album is absolutely wonderful. It's hard not to be moved to tears by John McDermott's tribute to his parents and his collaboration with Kearns and Ronan Tynan on ""Red is the Rose."" But Finbar Wright is a worthy replacement for McDermott. When he joins with Kearns and Tynan on ""Fields of Athenry,"" it's enough to send shivers down your spine. I heartily recommend this album to those who enjoyed the tenors' first endevour and anyone who appreciates how beautiful a musical instrument the human voice can be."
2,"Good Voice, Bad Music","I brought this album in hopes in finding another Sarah Brightman, a cross-over opera singer with a strong and beautiful voice. There is no doubt that Emma Shapplin can't sing, it is just that the music is blan and uncaptivating. Every song sounds like the other, and all of the songs are dull, no gems on this one. Her voice sometimes seems not to be flowing with the music, and it seems as if she is being held back from really displaying her talent. The music also doesn't flow, and it seems as if the musicians can't decide what tune to play next. The whole album is substanceless and the songs aimless. Still, I have just purchased her other ablum, because believe she has the talent to create an album as good as Sarah Brightman's, so I've given her a second chance. However, I certainly wouldn't buy this one again, even if I do like the other."
5,My daughter loved this book!,"My daughter loved this book so much! We visited the Doctor's office one day and found another book by Kevein Henkes ""Chrysanthemum"". I came to amazon.com to order it because of her love of ""Lily's Purple Plastic Purse""!"
4,Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse,"My granddaughter loves this book. It was just a little long for reading before bedtime, where my grandkids usually have a choice of three books each read to them."
2,Politicizing a children's book??,"My MIL purchased this book for my daughter who is 15 months old. I just recently sat down to read it to her. All in all, a cute book, but I was surprised and annoyed at the illustrations in the book. This book definitely has a liberal slant to it - the teacher wears ""artistic shirts"" and in the picture, he has the words ""Global Village"" and ""One World"" written on the chalkboard. Really? This is supposed to be lower elementary school, and I found that to be a thinly-veiled attempt to convey liberal politics to the reader. Additionally, although not as annoying is that when Lilly's parents help her apologize, the dad is wearing a peace shirt and is making the treats which seemed to be, again, liberal in nature.The author is free to include his politics in the book, but I thought that parents should be aware of this agenda."
3,Too Basic,This is all the stuff you learned in high school. Save your money and ask your partner what they enjoy!
5,Very practical,"Practical is the word for this introduction to Logic and critical thinking. I just started reading this book although I purchased it nearly a year ago. I don't know why I waited so long to pick this book up. But, it's worth the read even if you understand logic. I,m using it as a precursor to the technical studies of logic. I've purchased 'Introduction to Logic' by Copi and plan to read it when I'm finished with this book. i started reading ""Intro to Logic"" by Copi just recently, but thought an intro to it was in order. This book will suffice. I recommend ""Think to Win"" and I agree with the other reviews of this book. The knowledge in this book is practical and not what the technical books will contain."
2,poor reception,"this converter is not that great. when you plug in your headset to this converter, the quality decreases dramatically. other players have reported that my voice is very low and has an echo to it. this can very annoying when you're trying to talk in paragraphs. other players have complained and asked me to use my regular headset. i would not recommend buying this converter just to save a few bucks. it's not worth it, dont make my mistake."
1,Extremely shoddy,"My first watch worked for a while, and then the indiglo stopped working, which makes it useless after dark. I returned that for a replacement, in which the indiglo again stopped working, and the interval timer began ""stalling"": rather than a steady 5 seconds of beeping the beeping became erratic and sometimes would halt, stopping the chrono along with it. I called timex and am now on my third watch. The indiglo still works so far, but the interval timer has already begun beeping erratically again.The GPS is hit-or-miss; it often loses the signal under trees or on cloudy days, and the algorithm the watch uses to calculate distance can't handle weak signals. Another annoying feature is that you have to dig through multiple menu screens to activate ""night mode,"" rather than just holding the indiglo button like on other timex models."
3,"3/4"" works, but 1"" doesn't","I used the kit to repair leakage of my very old brass Lawnlife anti-siphon valve. 3/4"" seal worked fine. 1"" seal didn't fit. After some trying, I used Teflon tape with it. It worked."
4,"Excellent- Serious, educational, and fun","This book was an excellent of counterfactual history. The fact that some of the world's finest modern historians, like David McCullough, John Keegan and Stephen Ambrose all contributed among others was a definate plus. Though a few of the scenarios written about don't seem to me to be the single most significant military event in history (the criteria stated in the Introduction); other scenarios that would, at first glance seem relatively insignificant, could definately be serious competitors for the number one position in the rankings of history's most important battle (The first chapter for example). All in all a realistic and educational book, useful for military and political leaders to see how much weather, disease, the actions (or inactions) of a single man, and just old-fashioned luck, determine the fate of battles, wars and history ever since."
4,Students of History,"As an educator and student of history, I found this book both interesting and insightful. The two things needed in the classroom. ""What If"" allows students to debate history. ""What If?"" teaches the actual facts to the reader without them (students) getting bored with ""textbook"" information. Their learning and having fun at the same time. Students enjoy creating their own counterfactual histories and ""What If"" offers excellent essays written by some of the best historians as examples. Highly interesting!"
3,"Interesting, though uneven ""History Lite""","I really wanted to like this book a lot. It seems like such a great premise, but just doesn't live up to its possibilities. I found many of the essays interesting, but none were earth shattering, and some were downright boring. Some of the essays concentrated too much on retelling the actual events instead of investigating the ramifications of other outcomes. When other outcomes were posited, often the possible results were covered only in the vaguest and most general language. Overall, I'm not annoyed at having spent the time to read the book, but it's not nearly as good as it should have been given the generally high caliber of the writers."
5,ENJOYABLE AND THOUGHT PROVOKING.,"I really enjoyed this book. I am a fan of ""what if history"", counter factual history, or whatever you choose to call it. This book presented a good range of ""what ifs"" in a chronological order. I feel fairly well versed on events from the Revolution until present, but appreciated the authors usually giving a synopsis of what actually happened in earlier times and places versus the what might have happened ""if"". Besides being entertained, I learned more than a few things. Good book. Just think, ""what if"" I hadn't read it?"
3,Get to the point,"Whilst interesting, it fails to expand on possibilites and rambles on about ""what really did happen"" (ie; true history). I see here the potential for a true masterpiece that fails to follow through. Personally, I would have liked to see future projections, not a rehash of history as it did happen."
5,Great Core Conditioning Drills,"This dvd was a great asset for our off season conditioning program. We used several of the core conditioning drills and exercises to keep our players in shape year round. You could either use this Dvd for team conditioning or individual workouts. We wanted to implement what the Professional basketball clubs were using, and this dvd showed us step-by-step routines. I would strongly recommend this DVD for a team or individual who wants to get to the next level."
5,Affirmations Made a Believer out of Me,"I was bumbling along through life as most of us are, when a dear friend gave me a copy ofAffirmations, Passport to Happiness. Quite simply it changed my life. It gave me clarity and meaning and showed me in detail how to have the life I want. The affirmations are simple and easy to do. When I lost my husband, the affirmations for grief and loss got me through my toughest times, and helped me let go. I now have a renewed purpose and faith in life. Affirmations done properly work."
4,Rare and Interesting,"It's not easy to find digital recordings of the works of Vejvanovsky. One album in particular that has not appeared on CD is ""Serenades and Sonatas"" featuring Musica Antiqua Bohemica. When I ordered this particular item, I was hoping it would include some of the same versions of works as the Musica Antiqua Bohemica. It did not. Apparently, there are 3 or more releases with the title ""Serenades and Sonatas"", but by different artists. Nonetheless, I am enjoying it and do not regret the purchase. The quality of the recordings is actually better than the Supraphon I seek."
2,"Uncomfortable Fit, Mediocre Sound","The Sony MDR-IF3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear. Perhaps, if one were an elf or a small child, they would fit properly; however, if you're like me, a mere adult mortal, they probably won't fit you.They would be okay for simple stereo listening, but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description. If you're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie, the SONY MDR-IF8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money."
3,Not Quite Right,"In general, I have been satisfied with the Take Along Thomas line. My almost 3 year old son loves them. I'm not as pleased with Emily. I know this is nit-picky, but her proportions are not right. Her coal tender is as big as she is and she is the same size as Thomas. My son has noticed that his toy Emily doesn't look like Emily on the show, and he gets mad."
3,Very Weird,"This film is definitely the strangest kungfu film I have ever seen. It is full of crazy costumes, and there are many comical things in it like a man whose arms are 15 feet long, a man who is painted gold, and a tiger style kungfu practicioner who is painted with tiger stripes and roars when he fights.The fight scenes are actually not that bad, but the rest of the movie is not very well made, and the story is a little boring at times. Polly Shang Kwan is alright in this film, her fight scenes are good, but she has definitely been in better films than this. I gave this film four stars because I am aware that some people like these very weird kungfu movies, and for those people this film would be excellent. The film is full of superhuman powers and magic, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes very strange and comical kungfu movies."
5,An essential for every household,This is such a terrific book and perfect for anyone with even a remote interest in women's history. I bought it to share with my 12-year-old daughter and the two of us have had a wonderful time reading it.
4,Can't Get Sample Code,The book is generally good for a beginning book. The problem is that you can no longer get the Sample Code as the publisher WROK has been sold and is no longer keeping the old sample code on their site.
3,Buyer Beware,I'm sure Hunter makes good fans and this may even be one. I never got around to installing it though because unlike what the description states this fan uses the new standard for ceiling fans of candelabra light bulbs. I had ordered this solely because the description indicated medium base bulbs could be used and I have returned the fan.
3,Good fan,Easy to install but the light kit is not for regular bulbs. I guess I should have researched this a bit more before paying 122 bucks for the fan.
4,cannon zr80,I purchesed this camcorder 5 years ago. Haven't used it a lot but when I have I have bee happy with it. The only thing is the batterry. It only last 25-30 minutes. It sopose to last an hour. The tapes are 1 hour so you have to find a plug that you can use and are not in the way while shouting. The quality is great.
2,LOUD Motor Noise!,"The first ZR80 that we tested on Christmas morning had a lot of motor noise and it was very distracting when watching the tapes.We exchanged it through Amazon, and the second one was even louder! The recordings are unwatchable because of the noise.I wrote Canon directly, and their response was was ""The ZR80 does produce some motor noise when recording on the tape. Thisis considered normal for this camcorder.""I'll be exchanging this one for a Sony. Too bad, I like everything else about the camera and I have had good luck with Canon products in the past."
4,For a Baby,I gave this to a niece for her baby at Christmas. She loves to read it to her daughter since she wants to bring her up in a bilingual household.
3,Joe Beck and (Just) Friends,"~ Not exactly sure why Amazon has this CD listed as being by Danny Gottlieb, when clearly it is by the Joe Beck Trio. Perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that Joe Beck has another CD titledFriends.~ This 2002 CD finds Beck fronting a trio with bassist Mark Egan and drummer Danny Gottlieb. The program is mostly jazz standards presented in a straight-ahead jazz manner with some jazz-rock fusion moves thrown in occasionally. Joe adds three original compositions. His playing is focused and inspired throughout the CD and there is strong rapport with Egan and Gottlieb.~ Pleasant listening, but neither inspirational nor essential.~ If you are interested in hearing Joe Beck play standards in a guitar-bass-drums format, I recommend his DMP discRelaxin'. On that CD Beck uses a much cleaner sound that accentuates his excellent articulation of single-note and chordal solos."
1,Rated B for Bad,"This movie is so technically incompetent that you could use it as a ""how to"" on how ""not"" to make a movie. You can listen to the director's commentary and hear him apologize for nearly every scene in the movie. ""Too much light, too little light, not enough Chihuahuas, not a big enough budget"" are some of the excuses he uses to explain away the movie. Still, I have to give him credit for trying. How many of us would try to sell our first movie? Could I do better? Probably not. Not for a first attempt anyway.Still, you expect some level of technical competence even from a small budget movie. You won't get that here. It's only worth a chuckle for how bad it is."
4,a powerful bias,"Excellent detail, thoroughly documented. The book covers a wide range of significant figures in the city's colorful past. The major problem is that the authors stretch to fit the past 50 years of US history into the Las Vegas nutshell. Perhaps the bigger problem is the all encompassing political bias of the authors (conservative = reactionary) and the absolute lack of questioning of the cultural norms that the city's rise has supplanted."
4,"illuminating, entertaining biography","Look go elsewhere, perhaps to Michel Foucault's own writings and more recently released lectures, for a superior examination of his thought. Hubert Dreyfus' ""Beyond Structuralism.."" is good and Dreyfus understood, apparently before even most of Foucault's French readers, the significance of Heidegger to Foucault's philosophical journey. Now as for this much maligned biography, this ""trash"": I don't care to argue with students of Foucault about all the flaws, much less disciples or fans. What I simply want to say is I've not seen another bio on Michel Foucault that was more entertaining, better written and gave a sense of the excitement that Foucault's life and work has generated over the past few decades."
1,Pure Garbage- Why Not Illuminate the Man's Thought Instead?,"This book had been recommended me, as a Foucault freak, and I must say that I was immensely disappointed. As one of the above reviewers said, he's just digging up a bunch of dirt that doesn't have much redeeming value in the end. I love S&M myself but 200 pages detailing Foucault's odd and disturbing behaviors in his personal life did nothing whatsoever to illuminate, for me, the connections between his personal life and his works. Follow Martin Heidegger's advice here: don't learn anything about the life of the philosopher you seek to know, let his works speak for him! A lot of academics were offended when Heidegger taught Plato this very way- way back in the 1920s- but believe me, it is an approach which is not yet outdated."
2,Disappointing after Sharkey's Machine,"After really enjoying Sharkey's Machine I was disappointed with Chameleon. I read somewhere that some of Diehl's books were great and others not so great - IMHO Chameleon was not one of his best.The first few chapters looked pretty good but after that the plot became devious, frequently unbelievable and difficult to follow. There were scenes and characters that didn't add to the plot, and baddies turned out to be goodies and goodies turned out to be baddies. The technology part of the story has dated a lot as things have changed greatly since Diehl wrote the book in the 1970's or 1980's.William Diehl had a reputation as an excellent thriller writer and it is great that his estate is releasing most of his books in Kindle format. They do need to fix the editing where every paragraph has an extra line break which makes it hard to follow the story.I still have a couple of Diehl's books to read and hope that they get better."
4,I was there!,"My sister and I played on the show in `1967 or 1968, we did Bobbie Gentrys Talahachie Bridge. I guess it was the Americian Idol of the times. It was quite a hoot for us at the time. That led to about 25 years of playing on the road, after Vietnam of course. Now I am settled down in Texas raising horses and riding Harley's. Great to remember. I wish I could find an original tape of when we were on the show, but I suppose that the tapes have been destroyed by now.In the wind,JB Dale"
3,"Nice shirt, but size is deceiving","I sent this item to my 130lb grandmother as a birthday gift. Although she said the quality of the shirt is really nice, the sizing is too small. I ordered her a womans large, since grannies don't wear form fitting clothing. However, my grandmother said the shirt wouldn't fit a 10 year old child. When I called Fansedge about an exchange, they told me that the cut of the shirt is actually a junior cut and not a woman's cut. Advice: If ordering for a woman, get a mens shirt."
1,Readers' comments,"Unfortunately, I have no comments on the book as such, as I have not read the book. My first impressions are from readers' comments, or more specifically, typographical errors from reviews written by readers. Upon seeing typographical errors, either in the typing or grammatical errors, are these reviews not proofread by members of your staff before they are submitted? I apologize for being overly critical as the errors may simply be typos - but unfortunately this conveys other messages, from caliber of people doing reviews to difficult interpretation of meanings of what that person is actually trying to convey."
1,Disappointing!,"I ordered and received the Regalo Maxi Gate a few weeks ago, but have been unable to install it because the diagram in the instruction manual does not match what was shipped. I called the phone number on the manual, only to find out that the number had been changed. I did get the new number and called it, but the canned response just said the office was closed--no information about when the office was open. I am going to send the gate back if I do not hear from someone in the next day or two, and will contact Amazon to find out if I can get back my return shipping, as the product is relatively heavy and will cost a fair amount to ship."
3,It's ok,"Well, it didn't turn out quite like I expected. I have a small opening that a little over 4 feet wide. When I ordered it, it said it would fit all the way up to 59 inches. Well, What I didn't plan, was the bolts are the adjustable part. It sucks because the bolts that were in the box did not adjust to as much as I needed which means I had to buy longer ones, which then left bigger gaps against the walls, and left my puppy able to squeeze through the sides. Unfortunatly, you can't order one any bigger, you have to pay way more to get an extension. wasn't to thrilled about that."
2,By no means the best,"I was looking for something to span the gap from my kitchen to the living room. unfortunately i had to work around a baseboard, and decorative molding at the top (beneath the side counter area) I made it work, but the gate is not as sturdy as i would have hoped and I bought it 6 months before i installed it, so i believe it is to late to return :/ looks like we're stuck with it.... So long as it does it's job and keeps my little one out of the kitchen, I will be happy... I suppose."
5,These boxes were fabulous! Fits all my things and they look terrific for the price. I am very satisfied,"Great boxes! Met all expectations, they fit everything and look fabulous. A very good deal for the money!"
3,"Nice, but . . .","This is a pretty alternative to a metal or plastic file box, and the hanging folders fit perfectly. However, the top doesn't fit or lap the sides; it does cover the basket, but it falls off if touched."
2,Not worth the money,"I have never seen The Hip in concert and after watching this DVD, I don't want to see them live. I love their music on cd, but Gord Downie ruins every song on this dvd. He rants and raves and spazzes out on every song. He talks over the music, which is very distracting, example, yelling at his microphone:""Microphone stand thinks he's a man, but can't get away from me!"" When he does sing, it's more like yelling. The one nice thing is this dvd is less than I would have spent on a ticket. I will just enjoy their cds and that's it."
2,Not great - but it works,"Very low end camera. No LCD image viewer -- you must plug in to TV or computer to see the pictures. Only holds 8 pix in hi-rez mode (lower rez and movie features work but are poor quality and are simply unusable). Digital zoom is worthless. Buggy software included. Still -- it takes ok hi-rez photos (usually with a green tinge, but that can be fixed with the software). Oh, it eats AAA batteries for lunch. Spend more $$ on a better camera and be happier than me."
1,DON'T BUY THIS POT!!!!,"I purchased this pot about 8 months ago. Everytime I used it the lid would get stuck. I think the lid is just too tight so when the pot expanded from the heat of cooking, it was impossible to remove the lid. This weekend I tried with all my might to remove the lid and the handle broke off. I then used a hammer to pry the lid off! This was with guests over for dinner!!!!In the end, my pasta was served and this pot was in the trash bin."
1,You get what you pay for,"The earrings were beautiful except they fell apart, the first time I wore them. I was sitting at my desk, and I felt one fall out of my ear. The hinge is fragile, flimsy and broke, while in my ear...oh well"
4,My daughter loves to cook with me,"I cook everyday for my family and my 3 year old daughter loves to help. We don't have a large house, so we have no room for one of the larger play kitchens. This one is perfect! She puts it on the counter, grabs her play pans, and cooks away right next to me. It is great play time for both of us and she is learning to cook at the same time. I see this toy lasting quite a while. It is also high quality, not plastic, and easily stored away in a cabinet when she is not playing with it. I love this toy and this company. Everything from Haba that I have bought has been wonderful."
1,haba play cooker,"the kitchen isn't wooden, it is made of plywood :( I think $40 is too much for something made of plywood buyer be aware."
1,Another Celebrity Book,"Katie Couric is a journalist, not a children's book writer. Writing children's books is a lot harder than most people think. Most publishers shy away from books that rhyme, and for good reason. Also, as adults, WE like kids to learn good morals, but children needn't be (figuratively speaking) bopped over the head with it, as in this book."
4,Chic Book for Chicks,"Learn about life in the biggest little small town in America and play the game of cat and mouse with deadly circumstances. The Monk is a crafty, killing ex-cop with vendetta written all over him and his spy-mate. They work hard to take down Jay, his own little spy, his wife and the crew of the casino and hotel. Made me a little dizzy with so many twists and turns. A surprise and eventful ending to the wicked and maiming of the main characters. Not sure why the author had to insert her rough and kinky sex acts into the script. Women will love the graceful chicks and the debonair men with smooth sex intentions. A little long for my preferences. A good read overall."
5,As advertised,This player is what I was led to believe and look forward to using it on a upcoming trip to Africa. It does download my Lexar Wa compact flash cards both thru the CF port as well as from my camera thru the USB connection.
5,Love this movie,"I am a huge MJ Fan.. This movie is great, I am also a huge fan of autobiographys on famous people. This movie is very close to what I know is how it was for the Jacksons growing up in Gary and then moving up in the lime light. After reading Moon Walk by MJ himself there are some parts in the movie that aren't completely true but I think that is true in a movie like this one. If you are a fan of MJ, or the Jackson 5 you will love to sit down a watch this one- it is a 2 disc movie and has almost all of the great Jackson 5 hits along with some of MJ's hits."
3,Good But Could Have Been A Bit Better,"The Jacksons: An American Dream along with The Five Heartbeats and The Tempations is one of my favorite male R&B group musical movies. The casting was excllent but the film does have some flaws.The film could have went into more detail about the fellas and it would have been great to hear Find Me A Girl,Daddy's Home and Rock With You."
1,Could I have my money back?,"I originally purchased this book back in 2003 and just got around to read.... I wish I hadn't. The book truly reads like a cheap ""telenovela"" by my standard... and I have a very low standard. The book is very long-winded and hard to read. The author's writing style is no ""Dan Brown"", so don't expect cliff hanging suspense from chapter to chapter.Funny enough the author's real name is Barry Shapiro... the same guy who also wrote the ""I dare you to put this book down"" review of this same book on this site. He actually did a better job of writing the fake book review then actually writing the book.I don't recommend this book at all... save those pesos and by a real ""telenovela"" in T.J."
1,Biggest dissapointment of the year,"What's this DVD? Is this really one of my favourite bands of all time, Fear Factory?I cant believe it.I've been waiting for this DVD for more than six moths only to find one of the worst DVDs I've never seen.Terrible sound and poor visual quality.Maybe my expectations were too high, but after enjoying impressive DVDs like the ones from Rammstein , ACDC and Metallica, Both with brilliand Dolby Digital 5.1 sound the I just can say something:Do not buy this DVD.It doesn't deserve your money.It's a mess , but truly speaking, they could have done it much better"
4,The paperback doesn't include CDs,"I bought the book and then found that it doesn't include CDs, and I need to spend 30 bucks extra to get these CDs."
5,Worth every penny,"I got this game even though I had no clue what it was or if it was any good. Little did I know that this would be one of the greatest RPGs I've played in a long time. It has a very unique battle sequence style but that just adds to the game overall. If you are still on the fence about getting it, just do it. I had almost 40 hours of game play into into it. That was all just story mode. I didn't do any level grinding throughout. Just get it. You'll be glad you did."
1,Cliche and very boring.,"I played it for and hour pushing myself to believe it was worth investing time, but not for this game. I wish you luck if you plan to buy this game - it did not work out for me."
2,"Let's rename this one to ""Brokeback Arms"" (nod)","I suspect the reason some reviewers liked the game so much better with ""subtitles"" instead of ""voices"", may be because they put an embarassingly feminine male character complete with quaint vocal intonations which are unmistakably homosexual in quality. Many typical people who do not respond with interest, enthusiasm and joy at the chortling and sighs of a distinctly non-hetero voice will likely feel very unconfrtable at having their teens and pre-teens absorbed in a game which injects this blatant atypical sexualization into the teen roleplay environment that is Brokeback Arms. Rent it before you buy it or skip it altogether (sorry I rented it) Some things are just deliberately vulgar, subversive, subliminally insidious and JUST WRNOG and compel most people to call it what it is for the sake of trying to ensure no further games of this type are created."
5,Both Girls Loved It,We watched this on Nickelodeon and luckily we got it on DVR. The 2 year old watches it several times a week and my 9 year old loved it too. We will definitely be buying it as soon as it comes out.
3,The SLAP SHOT of roller derby movies!,"The bad writing and stilted direction on display throughout KANSAS CITY BOMBER are easily overlooked whenever Raquel dons the spandex. In many ways, this is the SLAP SHOT of roller derby movies."
5,FANTASTIC ROLLER,"DOES A GREAT JOB WITH TIGHT MUSCLES AFTER A RUN, EITHER SHORT OR LONG. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! great for all athletes to prevent soreness the following day."
4,Does a good job if ...,"Does a great job .... if you use it.Let's face it, to be effective you have to use it and use it hard on your muscle, if not there is not point. And no one likes hurting himself.Unless you have someone else applying the pressure and doing it for you ... it will just sit there."
4,"Key concept, straightforward and short","Treacy and Wiersema make the case that the value of a product or service to a customer can be categorized in terms of efficiency (eg. low cost, on-time delivery), innovation (eg. latest technology or fashion) and/or customer intimacy (eg. customized solutions). They go on to argue that delivering each kind of value requires a different organization and culture, and hence the most successful companies are those whose business strategy is focused on delivering a particular kind of value to the customers that appreciate it the most, while remaining competitive in other areas. The analysis is accompanied by case studies of AT&T Universal Card, Intel and Airborne Express. The core idea of the book is valuable and 200 pages is plenty to explore it in detail."
5,nice,"the gods give breath of life back to rock and roll, and save a dead poddle from drowning. Spread the word."
4,Rock Solid.....pretty damn good,"This latest installmenet from the Myrtle Beach show is typical Panic. Easily proving it worth. I might give Light Fuse and Get Away the edge as my favorite live release. But Live at Myrtle Beach certainly gets the job done, as a fresh new batch to jam on, while we all start getting juiced for the tour. No Phish, Dead, ...and over a year off. Prepare for the hottest, hungryest tour on the jam scene in yrs. And definately take this disc with you to the shows!"
1,Worst I have seen in a while ! Beyond horrible acting !,"I should have known better when I didn't see a picture on the back of this DVD. This acting was the worst I have seen in the last 10 years. The main character couldn't act so you know that is the kiss of death for a film. The cinematography was a rookie at best. The story line was from a historic figure but could have done better much better. Elizabeth the blood queen could have made such a interesting story. If a real director actually did it on the caliber of Frances ford Coppola or Neil Jordon. This movie really really should not get any consideration please do your eyes a favor stay clear of this film. Do not rent, entertain, or buy this movie and I love B movies for the adventure of new discoveries but this is a waste.Trust Me"
2,Delivers disappointment like magic!,"Like bad pizza, even a bad thomas is still better than a lot of other things. The magic trick referred to is a tiny turntable inside the boxcar. The way it is supposed to work is that every time you open the sliding door the turntable shows a new content-magic!What we found is that the door is hard for adult fingers to open owing to the fact that the turntable was jammed up and stayed that way.This item promises magic and delivers disapointment. Spare your little one."
1,Thanks for perpuating the ignorance,"This book was one of the most offensive bodies of literature I've ever read. Not only is it generic but shes obviously pedaling her stereotypes to other paranoid sistas out there. Here is a suggestion, stop the hate and grow from love."
2,the Rancho de chimayo cookbook,"book content is fine. condition was listed as used/acceptable. I will not order another book with that condition listing ,condition is not acceptable . Thankfully it is just for personal use and I expect it will be ok for that ."
1,this is crap,"I'm so upset, who sells one track cds any more. Better to just download them illigally, honestly I was happy til he put the cd in and it was only one track. Very upset with this purchase"
5,The classic theological work of the 20th century,"A profound work that reflects on how man can apprehend God and have an encounter with the ineffable, and the radical amazement that man experiences when experiencing the presence of the Divine. Heshcel's major themes include the problems of doubts and faith; What Judaism means by teaching that God is One; The essence of man and the problem of man's needs. He discusses the definition of religion in genral, and of Judaism in specific, man's yearning for spirituality; Judaism as a pattern for life, and a study of what piety really is. One of the few books to reecive accolades from Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jews, as well as many Christians."
5,eye opening,"Man is not Alone is an extremely valuable read for ""the searcher"" who knows only the modern world of the the 21st century. For those who are receptive, Heschel hits certain core aspects of the self that can change one's perspective of the world in which they live permanently. I am not going to provide specific examples from his chapters because when reading Heschel one is convinced of the inability of language to express all of our human longings. Read the book with an open mind and an open heart. Hopefully, Heschel's words will affect you in the profound way they have affected me."
1,too long,"They dont say it here but the cup that comes with this product is 6.25"" long, which is huge. im not sure how big of a girl its made for but its certainly far too small for an average sized girl."
4,Interesting but predictable,"I think this movie has an interesting plot , but it's kind of predictable. Anyway even when is a low budget film, is much better than other "" hollywood horror films"" . About being ""Blu-ray"" I didn't notice the difference, so the price is fare for quality. (For me it was really cheap! )"
5,Superb!!,"One of the very few CD's I own where you can actually hear AND feel the bass line. I can't really compare it to anything out there at the moment. It was novel in 2000 when the CD came out, and there still is anything as sophisticated - except perhaps something like Coldplay. If you want to hear great songs, great guitars, superb basslines, excellent vocals, and something special and different, then this is probably worth the money. It's a shame they haven't released any more material."
2,Too Much for Tweens,"My daughter picked this up from her school library and brought it to me after she read the first chapter because she said it made her uncomfortable. The language was very suggestive and might be fine for older kids, but it was not appropriate for my 12 year old."
3,o.k. but not great,"A few parts of this book were absolutely wonderful, but for the most part it was boring and predictable. Throughout the story, the characters were well developed, but the plot went abolutely nowhere. I would recommend this book only if you've got a lot of time and nothing else to read. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste your time on it."
5,The best old school skater in the world,If you like old school tricks you are bound to role with this video. He is my favorite skater and the best in the world to me. He does some of the most crazy tricks you have ever seen and you probibly never thought that they were possible. Well if you like old school and you like to see some crazy tricks then you should buy this tight dvd.This video will own you and it is the best video of Rodney Mullen you will ever see.
2,Wrong Gasket,"Not sure it it was due to an error in listing or they sent the wrong one. The old Valve Cover Gasket had lots of holes for the bolts, this one didn't have enough. Definitely not the right gasket for an 88 Jeep Wrangler YJ 4.2 liter"
3,color sudoku,"I really like this idea for sudoku. I am teaching the game to my grandchildren and like the fact I can use any sudoku book and make the game easier for them by just filling in more of the numbers from the answers. I do agree that the game should have the numbers colored in in black or white to make them easier to read. The picture of the game show it this way, but the one I got was not. I did this myself with a black sharpie and some white acrylic paint. Also the tray that holds the extras pieces is to shallow and sticks when you try to open or close the drawer because the pieces catch, so I put the extras in a ziplock bag. To bad the manufacture did not play with their game before they made it. The difference between a great game and an average or poor one is often just some small things."
2,BURNED on the Junior Vasquez Remixes Again!,"What is up with getting burned with these Junior Vasquez remixes. First, only the edit of his remix for Wannabe is available on and import CD single (and later download) and now only the Du(m)b Girls version is available here on download. WHY NOT THE FULL VOCAL AT LEAST? Back when this song was new, the stupid Vasquez remixes were only on vinyl just like Wannabe (except for an edit on import CD). The import had the Motiv8 remix which I did not care for. It's nice that a full dance remix does show up here - not Juniors (otherwise I wouldn't be fussin') but I guess it will have to do. Also, there is an R&B remix that's basically like the original version."
4,Peasant's Choice,"I am a fan of James Barber. His writing style depicts the type of homey no-fuss cooking at which he excels. His instructions are clear, concise and fun to follow. But best of all, his recipes really work and are always a success, good, inexpensive and tasty on the palate."
2,What?,"Never before has a Cisco book covered so many protocols so poorly in so little space. I actually felt more confused about IS-IS after reading this book than I did before I started. The coverage of other protocols is little better. The author's frequent grammatical slip-ups render many sentances open to contracdictory interpretations. On the whole, I would recommend the CCIE Routing TCP/IP Volumes I and II before this book. There are some good chapters here and there in the book, and some good information you won't find elsewhere, but the middle chunk of the text is a waste. So much of this book is a bad rehash of what the CCNP or CCIE candidate will have already studied elsewhere as to make the reading experience as a whole discouraging."
3,"""Painfully"" campy horror movie done by husband & wife. Fun!","I collect movies made by Sam Elliot. It is always a treat to see him portray a character other than a cowboy. Sam and his real-life wife, Katherine Ross, manage to make a pretty good horror movie for us. As with all movies of this genre, the plot has a few ""holes"" in it, but over-all, the suspense and decent acting contribute to make an entertaining hour and a half."
3,Pleasant background music,"Pleasant, though routine, arrangements of favorite Christmas carols. Expertly played, though mainly nice background music. Similar to ""Country Mountain Chirstmas,"" but with different tunes, of course.Country Mountain Christmas"
5,Wonderful Item,This is a great product with the best price found. We have enjoyed using the laser print on DVD's and CD's. We think this will make nice gifts when putting on family pictures or vacation pictures.
1,Worst can opener I have ever had,"This can opener worked well the first few times. Then the feature that stops the can opener automatically stopped working. Now it starts working and then stops before the can is open, so you have to restart several times to finish opening the can. It also gets jammed. I gave up and started using my manual can opener. This is the worst can opener ever. I will never buy another Cuisinart product."
2,Not worth the money,"This can opener didn't work well especially with large cans. I was very disappoined. We paid at least $50.00 for this thing. It would bog down and acted like it didn't have enough power to rotate and cut the can. I was ready to throw it out when my son discovered if you press ""in"" very hard it will work. Pressing down (as with most can openers) is not enough. Press down and in simultaneously and it usually works. I have had can openers much lower priced than this one that actually worked better. I didn't expect this type of cheap merchandise from Cuisinart."
1,Displeased with warranty,"Received this can opener as a wedding gift and loved how well it looked. However, a few months later it broke! You push the top down and it does nothing, no turns and no sounds. I call customer service to find it is still covered under warranty but in order for them to send me a new one I would have to pay them $10 right then over the phone and also pay out of my pocket for the S&H to send the broken one back to Cuisinart. What did the warranty cover exactly??? I will take my $10 and money for S&H and go to our local walmart this evening and buy us a new can opener of a different brand. Will not be purchasing Cuisinart products in the future."
1,Crap,Lasted about two weeks and company wants me to spend my dime on sending this heavy thing back to them? Threw in garbage and lesson learned. Should have read reviews first instead of impulse buying.
1,"Lovely, Streamline Junk!","All I can say is Cuisinart should be ashamed of this one. I think they pushed this one out the door late quarter of 2008 so it would sell like mad, so their year end balance statement would look good. Now they can have them all back! And, I'm so disgruntled by this unit that I now avoid Cuisinart like mad!"
2,Disappointed at first look,"The picture doesn't show the ugly black cord - looks ridiculous with all the other white cords and walls in my kitchen - After reading the reviews of others, I'm just hoping the can opener works well - With a $50 price tag, it should!"
1,Really disappointing,"Don't bother with this can opener. You will be frustrated and disappointed. Very quickly, this can opener seems to magically become unable to open anything without great effort to get the blade just right and even then, it sounds like it's a very old rickety appliance as it feebly goes around. Terrible, and I thought the Cuisinart name would mean a good product."
1,JUNK,This device worked about 5 times and then KAPUT. on every can it would freeze up and then it started to trip the GFI breaker on the outlet......DONT buy if you do take it back ASAP
1,Do Not Buy this Can Opener,"I thought I was buying a quality Cuisinart product and was willing to shell out almost $50 for it. It's a terrible, terrible product. Every can we open is a struggle - it either won't penetrate the can and if it does, you have to manually turn the can. What a disappointment!"
1,ZERO Stars for This POS,"Only thing its good for is a paper weight. Like all others stated, after a few weeks, simply stopped opening cans. It pierces, but wont advance a cut AT ALL. Metal filings in your food....lots of cursing...lots of ""if I could only get my hands on the mo fo who designed this..."" lots of spilled can innards.I HATE CUISINART PRODUCTS..!..to cuisinart....if you know what I mean."
1,Stay Away from Cuisinart Can Openers,"Like the ""Cuisinart SCO-60 Deluxe Stainless Steel Can Opener SCO-60"" also reviewed on this site our Cuisinart ""Deluxe"" stainless steel can opener broke within a couple weeks of buying it. The device appears solid, but the actual blade attachment is connected to the rest of the body with a seemingly very fragile plastic piece that will shatter after little use."
1,Can Opener Disappointment,"I am truly disappointed in this product. Save your money it is definitely not worth it. My previous can opener (KRUPS) I've had for over 7 years, the blade had become dull and it was looking dingy so I opted to buy a new one. I was so excited when I got this nice looking stainless steel can opener at the very beginning of Dec. 2006. The can opener broke within 4 weeks, the attachment with the blade came completely off. I thought I was buying a quality product and was horribly dismayed to find out otherwise. I now am expected to return the product at my expense. I'm sending it back, but I will think twice before I ever buy another Cuisinart product. Save your money!! Don't buy this product!"
1,Broken in days; same troublesome plastic part as others have noticed,"We bought the white version from Bed Bath and Beyond. We experienced the same quality issues as many other reviewers have noted. After a few days, it would not reliably latch onto cans, and finally the plastic piece behind the metal gears snapped off and launched across the room. Took it back to the store for a refund, and will not buy Cuisinart small appliances again!"
5,Great Product,"This stuff is simply the best, provided you follow the application instructions. Works great as a base and top coat... my manicure lasts WAY longer with this polish. Would highly recommend!"
3,Nothing Special,"I don't think it's anything special, especially for the price. Could have probably done just as well with one of the ordinary product lines out there."
5,better than acrylics,"This product is one of the few I've ever loved enough to review. Had Acrylics for 15 + years and have now used this instead for two years. My nails are hard and long. No one believes they're my natural nails. I used it exactly per instructions after removing acrylics and still apply a coat every other day. I use it with color as base coat, then top coat. My manicures (home) last 2+ weeks with no chipping only slight wear at tips from typing. Love it!Nailtiques Formula 2 - for thin, brittle nails - 0.5 oz"
3,"Cute toy, buy annoying","We bought this puzzle for our daughter, who loves farm animals. The sounds are great, and the quality high, but there's one problem. The sensors in each piece's slot that cause the sounds to be made are way too sensitive. We found that turning off the lights (in either the room the puzzle was in, or an adjacent room) would set off one of the sensors, and a ""mooo"" would inevitably be heard. You have to cover up the entire puzzle (a heavy floor pillow works) to avoid this. I don't know why they didn't make the sensors mechanical - otherwise this is a great puzzle."
2,No off button for animal sounds & too thick for wire frame,"I repeat - No Off button! This is the most annoying feature of this puzzle board. Other reviewers have explained the trigger for animal sounds, which is helpful, but our other puzzle boards sit nicely in their wire frame holder without a need for a heavy floor pillow to cushion or stop random animal noises.The other major con is that it is slightly too thick to sit in the wire-frame puzzle holder.Same durable excellent quality as other M & D wood products - colors/picture does not rub off, no rough edges, but unfortunately the animal noises occur rather inconsistently. For example, the rooster will continue to crow even though the only piece missing from the board is the pig. Amusing at first, but became annoying rather quickly."
3,It is haunted.,"We were sure we had a polterguist until we took the batteries out of this puzzle. Everytime someone walked by it went off. We heard cock-a-doodle-do in the middle of the night. I even had a friend that was telling me how she was sure her house was haunted and was saying that she was hearing things from the basement in the middle of the night. She has this puzzle so I told her to take the batteries out and since then her ""haunt"" has moved along. :)Doretta"
4,Like it.,"My daughter is 19 months old and is able to do this puzzle. She loves it. The sounds are a little off as far as what they should soung like and it makes noises in the middle of the night, when you turn a light on or off, or if you just touch the piece with your finger. But my daughter is really proud she is able to do it and uses it all the time. Im looking for more to buy right now. I would recommend"
4,Contradiction or not?,"Aha! Gotcha is filled with very different types of puzzles than aha! Insight, which has many problems to solve. This book just presents many fun paradoxes that make you use your head, and while some of them are problems you have to take some time to solve, most are short paradoxical situations that you can think about for a short while and then go on the next page. It is easy to read, and Gardner again shows his skill in explaining interesting phenomena in a clear and interesting way. All the problems are good exercises on logical thinking and introduces various concepts of mathematics and statistics without seeming like you're studying. It is insightful enough for adults, but I think children would be able to understand these concepts too if they are interested."
5,Top most,"This book is the best and funniest ever written about paradoxes and other brain-teasing stuff.If it is your first Martin Gardner book, I really recommend it."
2,Tried really hard to like it...,"I checked this book out from the library and did read it all (it was a slow week), but I have to say: the ""heroine"" was not likeable..she was self involved and bratty and it made it tough to get through this book. I rarely write reviews and I don't like to knock an author, but this could have been a better book if Evie wasn't so darned annoying...sorry!"
3,Pretty Good Summer Read,"I really liked most of the book, I picked it up with out any great expectations. I got into it, and couldn't put it down, but found myself disappointed at the end. Not a must read, but you definitely wouldn't be wasting your time either."
2,"Slow at first, entertaining in the end, with some snags...","This book really does not kick until well past the middle of the story. A lot of it is a description of family and relationship fights and the heroine's very, very shallow view of life and ""ideals"".What is really bad is the fact that the editors didn't catch some ""gems"" as ""cubic zirconiums"" (Hello?!!!) and ""Lamp chops"" for dinner (interesting...). Or does the author want to show Evie's ignorance?RDI books are generally entertaining if you want some fun light read, but too many of them are not well edited and that is a turnoff for me."
3,Entertaining but depressing,"When I read the description of the book, I was excited because I identified with the plot- like the main character Evelyn Mays, I am planning my wedding, and like her, I'd like to lose a few lbs. But in this novel, she became extremely obsessed and addicted to losing weight at the point that she selfishly overlooked her fiance's feelings, along with many others who were trying to support her. Instead of seeing this, she stubbornly went upon her own narrow opinions of what she thought was going on. I was a little disappointed with the outcome of the book, with the characters. At first I found myself identifying with her, then disgusted at some of her actions. The book is well written and enjoyable, to a point. I would have liked to see this character have more ambition in her professional life , where she was putting all of it into one single goal. She acted very immaturely at times.This book could have been so much better than it was."
5,Moved Beyond Words!,"I simply could not put this book down! Sheri writes with such honesty and humor, I feel like I am there with her. For someone to endure something like this and then share with others----WOW! Sheri rocks and I now think I am her number one fan! Cant wait for more of her words!!!!"
3,Samuel Taylor Coleridge is amazing!,"I first read this poem in 11th grade and I've loved it ever since. It is amazing in its capturing of the human emotions of loss, despair and many others. I would definitively reccomend this poem to anyone!"
3,Shave cream,"Smells ok, and works ok,nothing special and probably it worth the price, I prefer Gillette more., it's not the worst stuff but no the best either"
4,"Like it, has a strong smell as expected","I love this shave gel, protects your skin well and leaves skin feeling clean. The tea tree oil does have a strong smell, but that was to be expected. I knocked off a star because it does not lather as well as I feel it should compared to other gels. On the plus side, only a small amount is needed to shave so it should last a while."
1,NOT HER BEST WORK,"THIS BOOK WAS TOTALLY BORING, I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH READING IT. I NORMALLY LOVE HER BOOKS, ARE YOU SURE SHE WROTE IT? SORRY, BUT NEXT TIME I BUY ONE OF HER WORKS, I WILL GO ON LINE AND READ THE REVIEWS....SORRY JAYNE ANN, BUT I AM SURE YOU HAVE A LOT OF DISAPOINTED FANS THIS TIME."
1,Since most of the world's population would have to die...,Most of the world's population would have to die in order to go back to her pre-civilization utopia. Barring the apocalypse - of whatever kind you like - I don't see this happening.
2,"Robin, untamed...","So, does every book on Amazon automatically get five stars? It seems so. This retelling of Robin Hood, which has some narrative drive and energy, is also, like the Twilight series, a thinly disguised Christian tract, and one that largely compromises the multitudinous sources (NOT predominantly Christian) that were gathered together in the stories and ballads about Robin Hood. No worries. Robin and the boys still run wild in Sherwood, untamed by King John, the Sheriff, American Evangelicals, and other forces of oppression."
4,Open Minds Only,"I am not a Lawhead fan. I've tried to read his previous stuff and I just didn't like it. I've finished the books but not the series. His Arthur series was not to my liking. This series however, has changed all of that. This book was entertaining and enjoyable. I didn't get too wrapped up in trying to make his story fit my traditional understanding of the story because each author should be given the freedom to do their own interpretation. If you can handle that, buy this book, if you are some sort of traditionalist when it comes to story telling, then stay away from this one. Trying to piece together who fits where will drive you mad and take away from an excellently spun yarn."
4,An excellent retelling,"An excellent retelling of the Hood tale and much more realistic than the Robin of Loxley versions. I think there was a good bit of set up here, to lay the foundation for the subsequent books. So, not as much swashbuckling as I'd have preferred, but still a very strong telling of the tale and it left me looking forward to the follow up books!"
4,Pretty good story with some limits in flow,"""Hood"" is a fairly good read, but I found a few objections.The different names for the same things (a Welsh name, vs a French name ect...) made for some confusing moments.The Robin Hood aspects at times felt ""tacked on"" and not really a part of the original story line.Some of the characters I thought were poorly developed.But overall, it was worth the time. Four stars."
3,Good Book,The book is pretty good. Some of the exercises are a little hard to do but the techniques are good. My girlfriend has enjoyed what I have learned so far.
2,"Misleading, though not intentional","The soap dish is really a very small holder for a metallic ""soap"" of some sort. Not what I was looking for. Sales image pretty; sales description not clear and thus misleading. A disappointment. Now I have to find a real soap dish!"
1,Not for older Dakotas,"I ordered this for a 1994 Dakota. Went through their vehicle selection process and it stated it would fit my vehicle. Got the visors and sure enough, they didn't fit. Went through the exchange process and back through the vehicle process but this time I paid attention to the product number that the site stated fit a 1994 Dakota and it was the same one as the one on the box that wouldn't fit. So, I thought maybe they just packaged the wrong visors and went ahead and did the exchange. Well, recieved the next set of visors and again, they didn't fit.So, be warned about older vehicles. Just because their vehicle selection tool states it will fit, they may not then you get the fun of going through the exchange/return process."
3,Good Reference book for starting a consulting firm,"I have been reading this book and others as a reference to help me start a consulting business. I would think that someone who is going into business as a consultant would know a little about business so I skipped over those chapter. I found marketing, finding the clients, and creating the environment for the sale important. The issue on contracts and what to charge extremely important to my future. Unfortuantely I am starting a marketing and sales consulting firm and I found little to no reference on examples. This book is primarily for engineers, accounts, and attorneys.I will always keep this book as a valued reference as I add clients to my clients."
5,My new obsession,"I found this game on yahoo, and played the free trial, and now I'm completly obsessed with it. If you are a person who isn't into fast paced gaming with a ton of complications, this is the game for you. It's like a fairy tale that you control. What could be better?"
4,Great Stand for the price,I've purchased 4 of these stands and they are great. The quick release works excellent. For the price you cannot beat this stand. The only issue I have is that I wish the base was about 5lbs heavier.
5,Some of Disney's finest music,"Aladdin has always been a personal favorite of mine as a child, Jafar was just evil and the Genie was hilarious. The soundtrack is exactly like the movie with the instrumental pieces and the lighthearted Friend Like Me is the perfect introduction to William's character, and one of the catchiest songs of Disney. And a Whole New World is just a classic, and Jafar's Prince Ali Reprise is one of my favorite Disney villain songs. I wish Disney still made movies like this. The music is truly unforgettable. But I guess for a special edition soundtrack they may be leaving a few songs out, but it still does contain all the songs a grew up with."
4,"Great sound, great songs, but . . .","I concur with all the other reviews. These are some Menkein's best songs, and Ashman's lyrics are superior. The bonus tracks are wonderful, although I question the newer version of ""A whole new world.""My beef with this and many other soundtracks is the rearrangement of the material from movie order. I'm sure for cassettes it was handier to have songs on one side and background music on the other. But in CD format, it means you emotionally go through the story twice. Come one, why not give us the material in show order. Not all CD players can be programmed so that isn't the right answer. The same holds true for Lion King (movie). Is it SOOoo hard to put the songs and background in the film order?"
3,A Good Read,This was a good one but it lacked in the middle. Started off with a crime then it seemed that part died in the middle until the last few chapters of the book. Then it was like oh yeah forgot about that.
1,150 dollars for this??,"What a disappointment, especially because we ordered this for our daughter's birthday and we have to send it back because of the alarmingly poor quality. We decided to spend more on a HABA doll stroller so we would be assured of a non-toxic and high quality product. What we received was a stroller which had EXTREMELY wobbly wheels that feel like they are going to fall off at any moment. We looked for a way to tighten them, could not find any. Are they all like this? I hope not, perhaps this is a fluke, but I wanted to have this review up for others so they might think twice about placing trust in this ""Made in Germany"" product, which was a huge selling point for us. Other than the wheels, which are a huge problem, there is the problem of how it was advertised: ""classic beechwood doll pram"" and it actually is beech PLYWOOD, which I think they should state clearly."
5,"XLR Male To 1/4"" Male Adapter",Took a while to find what I needed but this is what I needed! Free shipping. Exactly what I needed at a great price!
2,This would get a C-minus in 10th grade world history.,"Perhaps I had the wrong expectation. The brief amount I heard on NPR made me feel I was going to learn about Hawaiian culture and maybe hear stories. This book was written in the time-honored tradition of one American explaining why other Americans should feel bad about being American. Not that she is wrong or has any of her facts misplaced. But Susanna has written a disjointed, self-serving, whining account of Hawai'i. Maybe she is lamenting the loss of a childhood that she may or may not have ever had. But each chapter is kind of summed up the same way: the noble Hawai'ian, raped literally or figuratively by the Westerner in the name of progress or profit. I am hoping that she has a chance to spend time with her therapist (since she has found reason now to live in New York)."
2,Doesn't follow through,"This book should be great. It has great potential but it does not deliver. It tries to be half theory and half practical and does neither very well. The theory is confusing and not presented well or logically. The practical Ansys tutorials are certainly useful if you are trying to learn Ansys (and if you don't have access to any other tutorials then this book is defintely worth getting), however, there is no attempt to explain what the tutorial is trying to achieve or what it is doing. With a little more thought and organisation this could have been a good book. In its current form I would not reccomend it."
1,Worst Book Ever!!!,We are at chapter 13 now and I now know that the book do not provide good fundamentals nor details to understand what FEA is all about. Tutorials are useless because they do not explain anything what's going on. You just must figure it out yourself. This is OK for secondary book. But don't expect to understand it without any other help. Choppy steps for the solution in the examples!
5,Atari at its Quarter Swilling Best,"This collection of arcade titles belongs in any dedicated child of the 80's computer software cache. The murderous action of Missile Command, the rapid seek and destroy tactics of Asteroids, the Melee that is Centipede and its sequel: Millipede are without comparison. These games are the raw nerve that ate up your allowance and pizza money. Four bucks for a slice of Sbarro's pizza and an Orange Julius, and an hour's worth of time on Asteroids to see those three precious initials of yours atop the heap. What is more evocative or reminiscient of this glorious enterprise that was the ARCADE?If you have even a vague nostalgia for memories like this, then you're cheating yourself if you dont invest in these staples now. The dreamcast and Playstation versions are quite well done also, hopefully Infogrammes will convert the collecton over to the PS2 soon. The Atari anniversiary collection is basically a reprise of this set, and is readily available."
4,This book helped me pass the certification exam...,"Bill Calkins' book does a great job of summarizing the huge amount of potential exam material Sun gives you. The author has met the (unstated) goal of determining what of the material can practically be put on a test, and he concentrates on that material. The sample (CDROM) exam is a great way to become familar with the test format and to review. You would be silly to think that any of those questions are the same on the exam, though. Plus, the range of subjects covered on the new 2.7 exam has been changed slightly. Some have been moved to the part II exam, though it's no fault of the author. This book will be valuable to anyone taking the exam, and as a handy refence to Solaris. There is no book like it."
2,Practically Useless,"If you're an experienced Solaris administrator, you really don't need this book to pass the examination. The information presented at this book is just far too basic. If you're new to Solaris, you need much more than this to pass the examination. Buy another one. I just don't understand why this book gets 4 to 5 stars."
5,great price great item,"saved me tons, i called around other places everywhere was telling me the part was 300 to 350. It took 1 whole day to arrive from the time I ordered it and it came with all the parts for installation. When I first put it on I forgot to put on the rear gasket and it didnt work properly, remember what your Dad always says ""take your time when installing something new""."
1,"I must agree, its a REAL stinker","I originally caught this on a ""Late Nite"" movie program, you know, the shows where the channel pays more for the electricity to run the projector than they paid for the ""rights"" to show the movie. To my regret, I watched the whole thing thinking, ""It can't get any worse, it'll HAVE to pick up."" Nope. It would have been better (and infinitely more entertaining) if I'd stayed in bed and continued to toss and turn. What's worse, I normally am very amused by ""B"" or even ""C"" movies. However, the alphabet doesn't have enough letters to rank this waste of film. Don't even bother. If I could give it less than 1 star, I would."
3,really strange,this was a classic strange horror film of years ago. I don't think many people remember it but for the time I guess it was kinda out there. If you like older horror you might want to give it a try
5,"""Hey, there's someone at the door""","I have always wanted a simple doorbell that would just say, ""Hey ... there's someone at the door."" This magical device does this and a whole lot more. Compared to what is available at the local brick-and-mortar retailers, this is also a very good buy since the instructions are very easy and you can always get your 10 year old son or neighborhood kid to program and install it for you if needed. There is a TON of pre-programed selections broken up into 14 catagories for you to select ... or you can program your own ""tune"" with just a little effort to learn how.Ain't technology a wonderful thing? I highly recommend this device if you're here because you're not all there. Cats, Dogs and small woodland creatures love the animal sounds pre-programed also!"
1,8k 8bit audio playback with click or pop at the end,"Disclaimer: I'm quality assurance engineer in audio field, so I'm going to be more picky than your average person.Pros:- Lots of different types of song and ding dongs.- Easy install and audible instructions on how to setup.- Can hook up to external speakers (the reason I bought it).Cons:- Very low quality recording or playback. It is 8khz, 8bit recording.- Most of the rings or audio playbacks ends with pop or click which means the end of file wasn't faded out properly or not cut at proper zero crossing point.- Not loud enoughIt was quality of audio that made me return this product.I hooked it up to good external speakers that actually made the noise in audio (you get noise when you have such low quality recording) stands out even more. and it made the pop or click at the end also more noticeable.I would not recommend this to people who think they may get quality audio playback or have a large home."
5,Must Buy Dancehall Cd,"This cd is a great new dancehall cd of the millenium. Not only does it have 26 tracks but everysong is a killer. It features Mr. Vegas in songs such as ""Hot Gal Today"" and the newly popular ""Tiger Bone"". And with the enhanced cd feature, you can watch the ""Hot Gal Today"" video on your computer. If you need something fresh to bump on your stereo, then get Stage One!"
5,Intense and magical,If you liked the after word of Moore's _From Hell_ or Grant Morrison's _The Invisibles_ is for you if you don't know what those are pass on. The word/music performance on this album by Moore will sweep you in the places of myth and legend and London. These vocal performances by Moore are the most powerful images going about the world today.
4,Piper's DVD,"It had a great main feature, good matches, the best of Piper's Pit (24 in all), and great story extras. What is everyone complaining about? You all were expecting more? Well, sorry but there can only be so much room on a dvd. My only complaint is that some matches and Piper's Pit's are placed out of order which can be confusing to newer fans. But all in all this is a terrific retrospective of the guy that had about as much to do with the 80s wrestling boom as Hulk Hogan."
5,Saiyuki.....I LOVE IT!,"Saiyuki is one of the best anime's i have ran into in a while, its funny and entertaining. i am extremely disappointed in the fact that they arent making em any more but ill take what i can get."
5,Definitely one of the best,"I fully agree with Ally about this album being one of the best reggae albums ever. Maybe it's the best. I can think of only one reggae album that is this good: 'Green Valley' by Militant Barry, produced by: Keith Hudson. It's more or less an even weirder version of this album and as far as I know not available on CD."
3,Melissa & Doug Numbers Sound Puzzle,I put this puzzle up for later. Granddaughter is too young for this puzzle. I'm sure in a year or so she will enjoy this.
1,disappointed,"When the puzzle came the ""u"" did not work on the alphabet puzzle. I wrote Amazon and they sent another. (also got a nasty letter, less then a week later saying return the old one or I would be charged for two). The second one had two letters that did not work so I am getting ready to return it---and get my money back!"
5,"Fun, education puzzle",Cute puzzle for a toddler who is learning their numbers. My daughter has really enjoyed this puzzle. She likes the fact that it says the numbers back to her when she puts the piece back in its place.
5,master p is the man,"master p has been my fav rapper since i was in 5th grade, im in 9th now, and i was worried that this album wouldnt be very good cuz it was no more priority records but universal, but it is awesomebuy this"
1,had to pick 1 because they had no 0 star rating.,Knock Knock? Who's there? Garbage! Garbage who? any of Master P's albums!

5,What's not to love!?,"You may view my reviews of the individual DVDs included in this collection, by clicking on those titles...but I did want to write a few words about how great this box set is as the ""complete"" James Dean Collection.It's not only his 3 classic films, beautifully captured, but a host of great bonus features. I wouldn't say it's ""definitive,"" but it's definitely a must-have for Dean fans.It's also a great way to introduce the ever alluring cult of Dean to the new admirer. Would make an EXCELLENT gift for almost anyone on your list!"
3,Predictable stories don't work for me.,The story was predictable from about one third into the story and continued for some time until the extended end which was anticlamatic. The end was unrealistic.
4,Good Product!,Great Product! Only problem is the Voice Command doesn't always recognize your voice. Traffic also is not that great for rerouting. But the menu is very friendly and screen is nice.
4,For the 1968 version. The 1972 version? The new version?,"I've seen the editions of 1968 and 1972, and it looks to me as if the book has gotten worse with time.The 1968 version, which one reviewer claimed Spivak praised, was more of a Mathematics book than the one from 1972. This one looks more mainstream; it looks like many other books, while the latter was more advanced, and had _more_ illustrations (to be honest, I haven't counted...) Less epsilon-deltas. On the other hand, numerics crept in the 1972 edition.How is this possible? Sales pressure, I guess...Calculus book have gone down that road too.Let's hope someone clarifies whether this last edition is really worth getting."
3,Student Solutions Manual Multivariable Mathematics 4th Ed,"Book is of lower print quality and not very well proof-read. Numerous small errors through out in notation, variables, etc. Overall, helpful, but below the quality and accuracy I would expect particularly considering how long the textbook has been in publication."
5,Great,Very informative. Useful to my studies at this time. Very easy to understand contents. A must buy. I will have this book for a long time
1,Not a good buy,I needed help with SOAP notes last semester so I bought this book. It was no help at all! Not a good purchase...
2,Nice but not as pictured,"So the quality of the tent is very nice. It is a nice heavy ripstop canvas and is very easy to setup. But it is not what is pictured three out of the four pictures on here show a big rain fly with an awning to sit under that you can actually enclose if you want. Umm well this does not include that big awning system nor the walls to enclose that awning. To get those you have to order separately a deluxe rain fly awning, then each separate wall for that awning. If you order it all you more then double the cost of the tent system as pictured here. I returned what I purchased but be aware this listing is only for the square tent that is all."
2,Locked UP!,"I've owned this game since 2001. But with my latest computer, I can't get it to load and play. No support. No information sites available. There is a line in the start up that you must delete to get it to play. Unfotunately, I forgot what, so now I can't get it to run on my current comp. If anyone out there knows, I'd appreciate the help. The game is good, but no deviation. But as I get better, I run the ops with fewer men and make it harder."
3,thoughts on this book,The book is really good. If you want to learn about the technicalities of the game. Gives a good insight into the game of tennis.But lacks the ability to teach you competetive tennis. Overall a good book for beginners.
4,Where's the Ullman shorts?,"I am an avid fan of the Simpsons, and I can safely say that I have seen every Simpsons episode ever televised. Now, I consider the episodes in the political pack to be some of the best the show has ever had, and with good reason. While there is a lack of political content in the episodes, that does not hold this collection back. However, there is one major drawback to this package: there are none of the Simpsons shorts from the Tracy Ullman Show. Those are one of the main reasons I buy these packages, so I was quite upset when there were none. Nonetheless, this is a great Simpsons package that belongs in every fan's collection."
3,Too heavy to manage for toddler,"This was a big purchase for our toddler two years ago. After three children, I knew a walker push toy was sure to be a favorite. We decided to go with this more expensive, durable product. It is beautiful, and incredibly sturdy. However, my son can only now push and steer it at three years old. And frankly, he is too crazy with it now, and when he hits something with it, it is so heavy, I worry about it doing damage. Bottom line, it is too hard to steer, and not practical for the designed purpose of the product."
1,Only for PostScript Printers!,"I wish I could say, ""Read the fine print!"", but nowhere will you find written that you need to have a PostScript printer in order for the server to work--in fact, all the product literature explicitly states that it's ""compatible with any USB-enabled printer""! It's not until you configure the device and you're requested to select the PostScript Level compatibility that you discover this requirement; I confirmed the requirement through Buffalo tech support (notably available 24x7). Caveat emptor!"
5,Nigella Whisk,I recently purchased 3 Nigella Lawson whisks off of the Amazon website. I have used the porduct for the last 4 years and it recenly fell apart - after much use. I bought one for myself and 1 for my daughter and my sister to replace theirs as well. Can't live without it.
3,PLAYING HAMLET,"For those of you not in the know, ""WOLFSONG"" is a followup to ""THE WEREWOLF CHRONICLES"". In this story, Phyllis has fully assumed a new identity as Loraine Turner, trying to jumpstart a career as a dancer. She lives under suspicion by the LA police for the murder of her roommate. The struggle continues in which Loraine tries to balance her increasingly problematic, chaotic life. It is an interesting story, though it was hard to accept the way Loraine was finally able to deal with living a dual life as a woman and a Wolf. Hence, the three (3) stars."
4,Works good!,"Seems to work well. Only thing I don't like about it is the gradations can be a little sketchy, if you want to print a b&w; photo print that is(when compared to the Canon cartridge). For the price I totally recommend it.Thanks guys!"
1,Broke after 1 week,Bought a 3 pack and all 3 broke within 1 month of use. 1 lasted only 1 week. Return or replacement policy is terrible as buyer needs to pay return shipping and that's about the same as cost of the toner.
1,Carton slightly damaged in transit,"Hopefully the toner cartridge will be okay. Arrived quickly, but was shipped in only the cartridge box, which was made from lightweight cardboard. The bottom of the box was slightly caved in."
3,Little black dots along the edge,"The first 15-20 pages this thing spit out were flawless. Then the imperfections started showing up. Most of the printing I do with my Canon Laserjet is for archival or temporary purposes (tax records, receipts, shopping lists, etc), so I don't mind the blemishes on the paper. In my particular case, I have a few black dots that show up on the edge of the paper in the margin. I think it's only a matter of time before I start getting lines across the whole page.Honestly, I'm fine with it, considering you're paying a fraction of the price for a ""compatible"" replacement, vice buying one of the Canon brand cartridges."
5,Shakira mtv unplugged,Shakira is the best! It was really fun to look at some old school shakira. In her early performance [1999] you can see her smooth moves and hear her wonderful vioce. You can select english subtitles and you can understand her songs while listening to her beautiful singing. You will watch this dvd over and over again.
4,In-depth look at the hottest weaponry in the US arsenal,"From the laser-guided anti-armor Hellfire to the nuclear-tipped Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM), this program contains incredible, never-before seen footage of actual test firings against a wide range of targets on land, sea, in the air and even space. 40 minutes of intense footage. Includes: Tomahawk SLCM, Trident II, Avenger, Peacekeeper, Amraam, Phoenix, Stinger, Tow, Sidewinder, plus many others."
1,sunset building birdhouses,"i bought the book to make this incredible guitar birdhouse. when i gathered all the stuff and went to copy the pattern part was missing. i contacted sunset ,thye cant help me because that one was outsourced and not available, i was told it was left out intentionally to make me use my imagination/it was not a simple piece. it was the part where the keys and strings attach.i think i wasted my money. it was for a charity."
3,wrong product,"I ordered the replacement rubber pads and they sent a replacement arm with two pads on it. It was not what I ordered but because I needed it, I made it work by drilling out the pads and using them with bolts. the problem was not with the problem, it was the company that shipped the wrong item."
1,Don't Expect a Book,"I ordered this sight/review-unseen: what a mistake. If you are looking for a 15 minute junior high school one act play, buy it. If you're looking for one Sherlock Holmes pastiche, pass! The plot takes place during the Great Hiatus, with Holmes chasing after poisoners in the Folies Bergere. Rather predictable, rather mundane but as I said, if you are looking for a one-act for pre-teens, it may work for you. I was hugely disappointed:P."
1,Do not buy,"This is only a few page play, not worth nearly the price quoted. Nothing else needs to be said except do not buy!"
2,stick to the teeth,"They taste good, but I can't eat them by themselves without big fear of losing a crown or filling! However, I break them up into very small pieces and put them in my oatmeal - the heat softenes them and it is quite tasty ;-)."
3,"Healthy snack option, too sticky.","Flavor is good, but they are very sweet and stick terribly to your teeth. There are three small bars in one package. Most of mine were stuck together and I made the mistake of biting off of that. They were so sticky that my jaw was sticking together and it felt like my teeth were being pulled out of the socket. When I finally got that under control, I felt like I needed to go brush my teeth from all the sweet. If you eat them individually you can avoid most of this and having a glass of water around will cut the overwhelming sweet."
2,Misrepresented Item,"The binders they mailed had only a 75 page capacity, not 125 page as advertised. I will be returning these."
5,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!,"Normally I don't love covers of rock songs; but there are exceptions and this Album by Pat travers is one of them; Every song rocks. They are as good as the orginals; except Inside Looking Out, which is as good as the cover, of the Animals orginal, by Grand Funk Railroad (Self titled red album 1969). White Room, Inside looking Out, are Highlights, oh heck every song is a highlight. Its a fine album, a must get if you wanna rock!!!"
1,Used Merchandise,"I just received this item from Amazon to be terribly disapointed by the speed. During my testing I realized why the box wasn't shrinkwrapped. This ""new"" item already had the admin password changed from the defualt and the manual already had writing in it. Ha!"
4,The Most Boring but also the Most Helpful,"This was the first Epidemiology book that I got my hands on when beginning graduate school 2 years ago. I absolutely hated the book and wanted nothing to do with it. However, now that I have my Master's in Public Health, I wish some of the teachers that I TA'ed for used this book in the school I transferred to. It's so ridiculously helpful for epidemiology majors that it should be a staple in every epidemiologist's library. It truly breaks down the concepts that are the bread and butter of epi, and teaches you what's truly necessary. The worst part is that it still remains dry and boring. Get through it if you're in public health - you need it."
1,Wrong Bed Frame,"Received bed frame not as shown. It has a cross brace going 90 degrees to shown, wheels fall out when frame is lifted, wheels will not pivot so the wheels will not turn unless aligned perfectly straight, they just slide across the floor. Was missing hardware to attach center cross brace, which the assembly directions do not show anyway.The frame is very flimsily made.This is what the ad says it is suppose to be, Restmore 46 Deluxe Series Deluxe Bed Frames with popular convenience features and Includes hardware for attaching a headboard, but what I received was another brand from leggett & Hall with no hardware to attach head board etc.Do not waste your money on this frame, very poor quality for being claimed to be made in the USA !"
4,"A GOOD STORY, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS SPANISH DISCO","I loved Spanish Disco, so was really looking forward to this book by the same author. I was mildly disappointed. I know that the story line has to move along, but I felt Georgia Ray moved a little too quickly in the time alloted for the story. I loved the drag queens and her friendship with Domineque. But I was very disappointed in her treatment of her best female friend. I won't go into here as it is part of the story, but I felt it was an unkind way to treat a ""best friend"". But overall I did enjoy this book. It was a pleasure to read chik lit taking place in another part of the country and with someone not in publishing. Red Dress Ink by and large publishes good books and I look forward to each month's publications."
2,Not that good,"Again the books were trying to find themselves. Though the Defiant gave the characters more mobility in a plot sense, this revisiting of Sisko's past didn't necessarily suggest perfection. It takes time to develop a new concept for characters that are being fixed in the public consciousness. This book tried to bring in some of Sisko's past, the past being an area thatthe book writer's can explore without fear of destroying some precious future episode. And though theres a heavy feeling of mourning, it's also nice to see how Sisko interacts with another crew."
4,One of the best Star Trek books ever written.,This is one of my favorite Star Trek: Deep Space Nine books. I liked this book because it continues with events that were first seen in the pilot episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The subject of the book made for a good story. It was suspenseful and exciting and it kept me interested throught the whole story. I like these Star Trek books because they acccurately describe the characters and events in these books with great detail. I think that the author of this book wrote a very exciting and suspenseful story. It was also very entertaining. I really enjoyed reading this book. I think that it's really worth reading.
1,The title is more interesting and enlightening than the book,"Another Fibonacci, Gann, and Elliot Wave book that ""fits"" historical examples to theory... Where's his trading record?"
3,High expectations turn out to be a flop!,"Generally fine ... yet I am expecting a Star-Sprangled Banner played in that town, alas!"
4,running files,"gives running files a neat, organized look. very handy; just don't put too much papers than it can handle due to tendency to slide off folder (common sense, right?!). slot for business card is a plus."
5,It Really Works!,"I ususaly never take the time to review anything I get off the internet, Until Now! These tapes helped me so much. I felt like every minute of my time was used effectively. I would listen while I was doing my day to day things i.e. driving to and from school, eating, cooking etc. I really think these tapes helped me. I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone!"
3,A good addition,"I used these tapes to prepare for October's PCAT exam. I probably listened to each section about 5 times. I found the biology review the most helpful, while the general chemistry section was very short. On the other hand, 2 of 6 sides are devoted to organic chemistry, which gets less attention on the exam. The organic chemistry section was not useful until I went back to my text books and did a thorough review. Unless organic chemistry is fresh in your head, the tape will be useless. I wouldn't depend on these tapes alone to prepare for the PCAT, but buy them if you can listen while you do somthing else, like commute, for additional review when you otherwise wouldn't be sitting at your desk studying. I scored great, but I think I probably could have done so without the tapes."
5,The Best PCAT Prep. Money can buy!,This package is probably what got me into Pharmacy school. I listened to these tapes a couple of times and then I did questions from old exams and I scored Awesome. These tapes are really comprehensive and they cover everything you need to know. Listening to these tapes helps you remember all those little things that are thought in undergrad science clases but everyone forgets. I really recommend this product to anyone planning to take the PCAT. Great Product. GOOD LUCK!
5,Husband loves it,This is a gift for my husband. He's a big fan of Webb Pierce. It contains all of his favorite songs.
3,"text of great old book, but realize it's an uncorrected OCR","This is a publish-on-demand made of an OCR scan of the original. So it has typos, no photos, but the captions for the photos and some page heading intrude mid line from time to time.This is not a complaint - the publisher is straightforward about it, and its cheap. And I was able to read it once I figured this out. But I hadn't encountered it before, so I wasn't expecting it.That said, it is the text of a rare book of a ramble way up the east bank of the Hudson at the end of the 19th century, with much historical commentary. As I live along the route, it's amazing to hear it pictured as a narrow dirt path...I enjoyed it. I'd love to have a facsimile instead (I think that's what I thought it was) - but again, there's no dishonesty here on the publishers part.I'm glad I got it."
3,Don't they have spell check?,"When this book arrived, I was sure it was a pre-publication uncorrected proof. Terrible, terrible spelling and grammer mistakes, really embarrassingly bad! While Conrad's adventures are fun, all those battle scenes get boring.Still, any Frankowski is better than no Frankowski."
1,Not what I expected.....,"This was not what I expected....it is like a book for a child. I was disappointed, unhappy and that is whay I am returning it."
4,it's a pretty good intro,"Greenberg and Jordan's book is a pretty good introduction to the work of one of our modern masters, Chuck Close. Chuck Close is a phenomenal painter, both before the onset of his disease and even more so after. You won't find many books on him, or many that contain his work. Until something a bit more 'adult' or comprehensive comes out, this is a good selection. It discusses his life and work. There is also a brief chapter on what is a portrait. They finish it off with a list of museums that have some of Chuck Close's work. It's a nice intro to a great artist."
5,Great cd,"Paul Meyer plays incredibly here. I can't imagine why anyone would be disappointed with his sound. No, it's not the French sound of 40 years ago, but it's a beautiful, flexible sound that works beautifully in these pieces. The pieces on the cd are some of the high points in clarinet literature in the twentieth century. The Berio Sequenza especially is an incredible piece of music for the clarinet. Anyone interested in the clarinet should have this cd."
4,Works fine,"The inducer fan was just what I needed. Unfortunately it came with no instructions. My Lennox furnace needed a drain hole drilled - I had to figure that out on my own. Otherwise, it is quiet and works perfectly. RMG"
2,Underwhelmed,Thought this would be a more comfortable replacement for ski goggles... but I'd honestly rather wear goggles. The Foam pads on the edge do not allow your eyes to breath like goggles do. They also fogged up anyway.
