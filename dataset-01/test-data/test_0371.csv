1,PLEASE DON'T PLAY THIS GAME!,"To make a long story short the game is terrible. The game has terrible graphics and bad gameplay. All you do is walk around and hit things with a stick. The best part of the game is the opening movie scene, it is actually pretty cool. Then it all goes downhill from there.... I made the mistake of renting it but that doesn't mean you have to make the same mistake. Remember what I said.Ok?"
5,fantastic,this game is awesome. the delivery was fast and it just brings back great memories. thank you so much for giving these memories another shot.
4,Durable,I bought these door locks when my daughter began to walk. They are very durable. Several times I have forgot they were on the door and they have survived very hard pulls without breaking or cracking.
3,It is alright,"It is a pretty good pillow, but like others have said it is a bit small. I have woken up once or twice no longer on the pillow, which defeats the point of having it."
4,Soundtrack's better than the movie.,"Based upon recommendations, I actually bought the soundtrack to ""Camp"" before seeing the movie. And because I did that, I can strongly recommend the soundtrack - and cannot particularly recommend the film because, oddly, the kids in the film are at their best when they're singing.""Here's Where I Stand,"" the power ballad performed by Tiffany Taylor and written specifically for the film, is an excellent and moving piece of music. Also good are the opening track ""How Shall I See You Through My Tears, ""For the Want of a Nail"" and the Sondheim booze-induced and sarcastic piece called ""The Ladies Who Lunch.""As for Victoria Williams song ""Century Plant,"" it's a bit different (particularly in an album filled with showtunes), but it fits, however oddly. It's fun to hear over and over.I was less impressed by Daniel Letterle's songs, particularly the bland ""I Sing for You.""All in all, it's good."
1,USED - - Be WARY,These shears arrived with no packaging and used! They looked super old and had nicks all over the handles and sticky stuff on the blades. Very disappointing and annoyed that it happened. I'd be very careful when you order. Sometimes you think you are buying something new (especially at full price) and you get something totally different.
3,code reader 2500,"it's good for reading codes but if you have windows 7 on your computer, you will not be able to update this reader. so beware, they say you can update for free on their site but don't tell you, you can't with windows 7, which is common."
4,seder olam,very good if idiosyncratic english translation. sometimes a tad hard to follow the author. covers rabbinic chronology from creation to 70 CE
5,A ledgendary recording for a Jazz master & ledgend,"I have yet to come across a recording that is so perfect as this. I bought this CD on a recommendation made by a columnist of a Sunday newspaper. Truth is, I'm not a big fan of the Bass. Boy did I change my mind after listening to this! Fantastic, clear, no hissing whatsoever and Telarc have absolutely mastered the recording of a master. A fitting tribute to the ledgend. I'm in audio heaven when I listen to this CD"
3,.....,"This cd was a compilation of all her previously recorded stuff. So if you have never heard of charlotte,here's a chance to find out what you have been missing on. As for me,I thought these were new recordings of the old songs, only this time with her more mature 16 year old voice. It only has a couple a new tracks, and she hasn't gotten a whole better. Her voice seems to be getting duller and duskier with time."
1,Charlotte is no Jenny Lind,"I had heard enough about Charlotte Church that I thought that I would listen to her Greatest Hits album and judge for myself. As it turns out, I cannot see this CD even being considered good as a stand-alone album, let alone a Best Of album. Charlotte, in my opinion is vastly over-rated and is no better than many local girls who sing in my area. If she is going to keep singing, she better sing some original songs because virtually any girl can sing the songs from this album as good as she can."
4,Astounding,"Charlotte really has an amazing voice. Hopefully, she will be able to cultivate it. My faves included Amazing Grace, The Flower Duet and All Love Can Be. I think that the duet with Josh Groban, titled The Prayer should not have been sung because Groban's voice is so much stronger that Charlotte's that is makes her sound weak. But it is a beautiful song.I believe those buying this album will enjoy it. There are plenty of well known standards and Charlotte does a good job with all. I believe that she is not that far away from a 5-star album. I wonder what this album is a prelude to?????"
2,R&B For Charlotte,"If a bird can be annoying as in a Rooster Crowing in the morning, some people will like it. A dog can bark in the nights we sleep, some People will like it. A human voice so light, so vibrated within their own dimensions, people will like it, but not I. I never really saw the beauty of opera, agitating to the ears, just like a Rooster calling on it's hens. With that said, Charlotte needs to turn to Blues Rock or R&B. Yes, Boogie style Blues Rock, she has the voice for it. No matter how many here perceive Opera or know what should sound good, no opera singer could ever sing Blues without a voice and a heart for it. Not One! So why should a girl with soulful music embedded in her, do the same? I say, ""it's time to really Rock Charlotte!"""
1,Negative Reinforcement,"In my opinion, Charlotte's label chose a very poor time to release a compilation of her songs from her first 4 albums. There are many faults with the way she sings; not the least of which is the fact she no long can sing with any sort of volume to her voice. While many of her faults can be attributed to age, we do not need to be reminded of this with a re-hash of many of those songs which showcase these faults. Hopefully this CD will be pulled from circulation until she can legitimately present a compilation of professionally-correct sung songs. A ""best"" compilation fo a 16-year-old is as silly as the book she wrote about her life at the age of 15."
1,Non-Professional,"I know that in pop music, you find a lot of artists who can't really sing. But, given the type of songs which are covered in this CD, I would have expected a high-level vocalist to be used. What I hear is a little choir-girl whose renditions are reminiscent of a caroler who recently sang in front of my house.This type of thing may be O.K. for shopping malls and the like, but should never have been released on a CD. It is very amateurish and makes me wonder what the future of music will be if this is the best a label like Sony can muster for the holidays. Not worth a listen."
2,Bad to the Bone,"Please turn this one off. Better yet: don't even put it in the CD drawer. No voice. She can't sing. This is bad, very bad. Give us all a break. The music? Two stars? I don't even know at this point."
1,A 1-Song Wonder,"I listened to the songs on this album because I heard the song ""All Love Can Be"" in a movie. I would buy the aforementioned song as a single, however nothing else here, in my opinion, is worth listening to. She has the formula for success with the above song and should stick with it."
1,This girl has vocal problems,"I was reviewing Charlotte Church's CD because I had heard her live in Cincinnati on 12/3. At that show, she was so bad that people booed her off the stage. So, I wanted to see if she just had a bad night or was her voice really that bad. Well, after listening to ""Prelude"" which is suppose to be her best, I have concluded that her voice simply isn't up to a professional level. She sounds like my sister in the shower. It also sounds like her voice has been getting weaker and raspier as she has been getting older. I also agree with some of the others who have reviewed this singer, who have said that her best singing was at a much younger age. She should not be singing, especially live, until her she can change her voice for the better. It is simply not what anyone wants to hear."
2,Preclude,"Having collected all of her albums, of course I want to get this one once it was released in my country. I could not agree less with all the reviewers on poor choice of the songs and degrading quality of her voice. I would not comment on the previously released materials, yet her 'new materials' are particularly below par, and 'The Bridge Over Troubled Water' is the worst of all (Go and try to listen to Russell Watson's version, and you'll get the chill). She's still young, however, and if she really works hard (I mean, really hard), she could again be the voice that once fascinated us in the Voice of an Angel. Come on, Charlotte, I'm still your fan."
3,What Happened? She should be better than this,"Charlotte Church did not use to sound like this...maybe it's because she's picking a harder repertoire but......she sounds a little bit too terrible in this cd...even in familiar songs like amazing grace, she shifted off-key while searching for the note....her notes are not always on and her voice sounds a bit rough...not smooth enough....i don't believe she used to sound like this...i just dun really know what happenedI've been comparing Charlotte to Hayley Westerna and I think AS OF RIGHT NOW....Hayley is the better singer because her voice is actually more pure and doesn't seem to have that ""rough"" quality Charlotte seems to evoke. However, Hayley's voice does not yet have ""depth"" yet...whereas, Charlotte's voice certainly has that texture and depth...although the main problem here is that Charlotte's notes in the selection of songs here are quite off...so for right now....i think Hayley Westerna is the better choice"
5,Awesome Fun,"This is a very unique game. Players lays cards, doing their best to not slide off the game board, and doing their best to push others players off. My family loved it.The learning curve is 2 minutes, and the game will enver be the same twice. Great family fun, and great for up to 8 players as well."
5,this is a must buy!,"My parents bought this book for me when I was a baby (28 now), and it was always one of my favorites. I still have my copy, along with Chorao's ""Baby's Story Book."" I purchased it recently for one of my best friends, who is having her first child. The illustrations are warm and whimsical. I loved them as a child and am still captivated. The lullabies and poems featured in the book are so charming. My favorites are ""Minnie and Winnie"" (mermaids), ""All the Pretty Horses,"" and ""The White Seal's Lullaby."" It is a must buy if you're looking for a baby gift. You won't be disappointed!"
3,Not good for a petite person,Dimensions are all wrong for someone who is petite. Skirt if too long if you are 5'5 or shorter....it will be below your knees. The top is probably for a size 8 person and can't really make any alterations because of the skirt. Just not a good outfit for anyone who is not a size 8 or 10 and shorter that 5'6
5,Fantabulous!,This is certainly a fine compendium of wit and good olde-fashioned homespun American lore that I can read to my children.
2,disappointed...,"I got this for my daughter for her birthday and spent [..] on it in the toystore thinking that it would be well worth the $$$. I cannot figure out why these things are sooo expensive! The windmill is just plastic and the little door that opens already broke! The mobile that is attached to the windmill part falls off every time we turn it!The critters themselves are very sweet and I like some of the wooden furniture, but I would not recommend the windmill. It is not worth the price we paid for it."
1,Flimsy windmill,"So sad, as I'd heard so many great things about Calico Critters. I bought this set for my dd. The first time we placed the windmill top on the playhouse, it fell off (a very short distance) to a carpeted floor, and the windmill broke off. For the price, I really expected better."
4,"Beautiful photographs, interesting reading","With stunningly beautiful pictures of California poppies from a truly talented photographer, Golden Poppies of California is a visual feast. The state flower of California, it is well represented in this collection of photographs. While it is the primary flower in the book, it also includes other flowers commonly found in the same area as the poppies. While leafing through the book the reader soon comes to realize why this flower would be chosen for the state flower. The author provides the reader with historical and other information on California and the history of the poppy. Golden Poppies of California is recommended for people who enjoy coffee table books, and especially anyone who likes poppies."
5,"Beautiful, Glorious, Exciting","The Alpensinfonie was a very enjoyable and well done performance. I especially wanted a copy of the Festiches Praludium because it was not included on another 9 disc set of Richard Strauss' orchestrial works. David Zinman leads the Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich in a Rich, Glorious and Exciting performance. Admittedly this work is not the most popular of Strauss', but to miss it is like missing the 1812 Overture."
5,Lexmark E210 laser toner,"Ordered replacement toner for Lexmark E210 laser printer. Price from Amazon was very good. Toner in printer now and printing text great. Any black bars, logo's, sections are completely black, no fading or lines in the black."
4,Grim and gritty,"An early Westlake, hard-boiled and gritty without any of the comic touches Westlake is more known for. His writing is as rich and evocative as it is lean and precise. I enjoy finding these old Westlakes, it is interesting to see how his style developed over the years, though his talent was clear from even the earliest works. And this, just as with the early John D. MacDonald books, was written back before the world of PC and it is fascinating to catch a glimpse of that period. This isn't one of my favorites, while it is well written and the plot is classic Westlake, I prefer his more comic style.If you're looking for classic pulp in hard-boiled noir style, 361 is a worthwhile read."
1,"SLOW, BORING-DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!","OH MY GOD-THIS IS AWFUL.IT NEVER STARTS GOING, AND GETS WORSE FROM THERE. THE COMBINATION OF A QUESTIONABLE STORY LINE, BLAND CHARACTERS AND NO ACTION DEEP SIX THIS CHILD-LIKE NOVEL.I AM A VORACIOUS READER, AND THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I SIMPLY THREW DOWN AND DIDN'T FINISH IN OVER A YEAR.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!BRUCE J. HOESMAN"
1,"Horrible on batteries, works when it wants to","I got this camera as an early birthday present. Less than one week later I had to return it. First the camera turns on by sliding a door that covers the lens over. This mechanism works only when it wants to. Half the time you can't even get the camera to turn on.When it's on it immediately drains the batteries. I changed the batteries twice in three days.Somewhere around the 6 day mark the camera just stopped working completely.In addition the software takes forever to download and ended up corrupting many of my files during the installation process. The pics are ok at best. They are pretty sharp if you're just going to email pics but if you're going to actually be printing them out, the quality is subpar.Overall a horribly disappointing experience and a waste of money. I have since exchanged the camera for another brand altogether and I am much happier."
3,Worth it for JR Returns,"if nothing else ""JR Returns"" finally puts a decent end to the series. The other Tv movie ""War of the Ewings"" is just plain silly and its so so sad it was the last ever time the characters were seen. As for ""The Early Years"", it doesnt have much relevance as it is all different actors and the Reunion special was on another set, but ""jr Returns""(which is the official final episode as far as Im concerned)is worth the package and on that note, there are no more Dallas to release.Will Warners now start to release 'Knots Landing"" which deserves to have the entire series on DVD.???????Unfortunately the first two seasons didnt sell well, but anyone who knows that series will know, it nevert kicked in properly till season 3 or 4."
5,change,dallas its a gift i said to amber merry christmas. love always amber i need you to change it if you can have it say love always your mom
5,My Daughter loved it!,"My daughter was having trouble liking any books in her grade level because they were not interesting to her. She checked out book 1 at the Library and loved the book. I bought her book 2 and now I'm ordering the boxed set for her. She finished book two and now started on book three. This is a great book filled with fantasy and imagination. You must read the books in sequence, if you don't you might not be able to understand."
5,Good Story and Good narration,"I am writing this in response to a bad review entitled ""Good story AWFUL narration."" I borrowed this from the library to see how the narration was before I bought it because of this review. Mark Hamil does a very good job of narrating. He does great voices for the faeries. He is right up there with Patrick Stewart, Rob Inglis, and Tim Curry in his performance. I was not disappointed at all and found it highly enjoyable."
5,For young readear? So what?,"The cover says ""for young readers"" but ... so what? Who's to say a grown up shouldn't be intrigued by a plot with children exploring an old house, finding old books that lead them to mysteries and faeries? Well, I did like it and I do recommend the series for people with like taste."
3,"Good story, bad narration","I've seen the movie and read the books. I admit the books are for kids, so adults don't expect Harry Potter here. The audiobook was terrible. It's not the story but Mark Hamill. His narration is just that, he's reading, not acting it out, just reading it. And it's terrible. I was not impressed with his narration. Parents, read the book to your kids, don't let Mark read it, I'm sure you can do a way better job. I do not recommend this audiobook."
3,Liked the Movie Better,First time responce for me! I liked the movie better! The movie made the tale a bit less gruesome and the characters more appealing.
3,"A fun car listen, but not a keeper.","My 8yo daughter & I listened to this over a few weeks. We enjoyed it, though not all of it was a surprise since she'd already seen the movie version.For me, had I read these individually they would have annoyed me alot. It did not read/listn like five books -- more as though it was one long manuscript teased apart into five shorter books so that the length would appeal to the target audience's age.The plotting was good and the characters were enjoyable.Mark Hamill's reading was quite good. We had a little trouble distinguishing a few of the characters (they sounded the same) but there were a lot of characters in these books, too, so it's understandable.Story: 7/10Reading: 8/10"
4,Spiderwick Box Set,Bought these books for my children. Books are hard cover and are very durable. Graphics on cover and inside book are nice. Great purchase!
4,"Short, but sweet","Bought these for my boyfriend's 8-year-old son. The kid adores them. They seemed rather short, especially for the price, but the kid has read them all once and is already talking about reading them again. He's very excited about the entire series."
4,Entertaining and Clever,"After I saw the movie I decided to buy to book. Found it very entertaining and clever. I am an adult, but love the imagination of fantasy books. Not a Harry Potter (hence 4 stars) but well written and a joy to read."
5,spiderwick,i relly liked the book theironwood tree but they need to give a update onthe griffin i would dfinitly reed the 5th book.
1,"Great Story, too bad disk 5 is defective","It was a very enjoyable and well red story, fatally ruined by the defective disk 5 that starts on chapter 2. I returned it for an exchange, thinking that it was a fluke. Sadly it was not, since this second set of disk had that same defect. I plan to return it for a refund and hope to not have any trouble."
4,vocal delights but ...,The main interest of this Traviata is of course the performance ofMontserrat Caballé. Caught in her youthful prime (1967) her soundis utterly gorgeous from top to bottom. She negociates the colora-tura of Act I with considerable ease and elsewhere her singing isoften exquisitely beautiful. She brings elegance and refinement tothe role but ultimately her style and manner are a bit too regaland stately for Violetta. Carlo Bergonzi is likewise all eleganceand refinement but he brought more spirit to Alfredo on his earlierrecording with Sutherland. Sherrill Milnes also caught in his youth-ful prime sings superbly but at this early stage of his carreer hesimply sounds too young for Germont. Georges Pretre has been harshlycriticised for his conducting but despite a few erratic passages heis fine. The score is complete with second stanzas and cabalettas in-cluded. In sum there are a lot of vocal delights on this set to enjoybut the end result is somewhat unconvincing dramatically.
4,"Nice, at a glance book","This is a nice, feel-good book. Good for a gift for the person who has everything. Or, a nice book to keep at work - just flip to a page during moments of frustration to lighten the mood."
1,Grammatical errors overshadow substance,"Ms. Moorhead's book is an attempt to tell her story. This book was obviously not edited. While Ms. Moorhead brags about being in ""honors"" English classes, she misuses ""there"" and ""their"" throughout the book, puts too much information in parentheses, and didn't even bother to spell check certain chapters. Being a fellow MS sufferer, I had looked forward to the book. However, the nonexistent editing was so distracting that I could not enjoy the content. Ms. Moorhead would have done better to wait for a publisher who would have helped her produce a viable work. This is not it."
1,Very disappointing - Needs serious proofing,"Although the premise of this book is good, the execution is very poor. I gleaned a few good observations from it, but overall I found the book utterly disappointing ... for content and especially for professionalism. The number of proofreading errors is extensive and the writing is less than organized. I found myself wondering whether this book was edited at all. Don't waste your money ... spend it on something more valuable to someone in their first year, like Multiple Sclerosis: The Facts You Need by Dr. Paul O'Conner."
4,Shortino - Rough Cutt,This album is great if you loved any of the Rough Cutt albums or one of the many songs Paul has been covering over the years.Hes voice is as powerful as ever and it sounds like he is having a lot of fun but with all the pain and emotion that has brought hem to get this new line up.In few words this is rough cutt with a litle more blues in it.
1,What a disappointment,This booklet has a great title but doesn't deliver content. You'd think that the author gives an action plan for each of the 21 days. Instead she keeps ranting and venting her hatred of men. She used obscenity and even insulted women as well! A woman who seriously wants to correct her man's behaviour or train him to be her pet will not find guidance in this waste of trees.
3,No tools with the Drill,"I just received this drill and I see that it does not come with the 4 attachments to drill as shown in the picture. I cant use it until I get set of those, why put up a picture misleading people what attachment the product comes with ? I saw mixed reviews of some people saying it comes with the drills and 1 saying it dosen't. Well mine didn't, so pls be careful about what you are ordering, there are other fiskars drills also on Amazon."
4,Good product but misleading ad,"I use this hand drill to fix flat tires. Using tire tool to enlarge the hole on radial tire before plugging it is extremely difficult. With this hand drill I could enlarge the hole in very little time and plug the tire and I'm on my way. The picture in Amazon shows drill and 4 bits in the packaging. When it came to my house, the package looked different than the one on Amazon and it did not have 4 bits inside the packaging. That's why I say misrepresentation or false advertising."
1,Flimsy,"This drill is virtually useless for anything other than very light work. The first time I used it, it drilled easily through wallboard, but the gears stripped as soon as I hit a stud. The chuck is also badly designed and it is very difficult to get it to grip onto a drill bit.All-in-all I wasted my money on this one."
4,The little drill that can,"This is my second one of these drills. The other was the Sears Craftsman version which I ran over with my car after 10 years. For quick work and smaller jobs - drilling picture frames, wall board and the ilke, this little guy can't be beat. It is very light, and fills your hand nicely making it very easy for accurate positioning. An inherent feature of hand drilling is that you have perfect control of the bit - speed and feed (or pressure, if you like). The shape makes for easy carry in a tool belt or in your pocket. My only complaint with this one is that the Fiskars drill lacks the little recesses on the forward housing to hold bits (with a rubber band that goes around the nose) The Sears model has this. This tool is practically indestructable, doesn't need electricity, and does very nice work. I'm sure this one will last just as long as my other."
3,handy drill for small jobs,"This is a great tool for easy jobs, such as drilling into drywall to insert anchors for curtains. It's light-weight and handy. I've been using one for years, and recently purchased this one for my daughter. The one that I have came exactly as the one pictured, with four drill bits that nest on the shaft of the drill and are held in place with a stout rubber band. The one that I purchased came without the bits and there are no indentations on the shaft in which they would rest. I bought the drill from Grady's Hardware, rather than directly from Amazon. When I reported the difference between the drill in the picture and one that I received, their customer service representative replied that the picture was only an ""interpretation"" and that I should read the product description. I don't know whether or not the one that Amazon sells includes the bits, but you should be prepared to purchase bits separately to go with the drill."
1,False Advertisement!!,don't buy this drill unless you already have some drill bits lying around or don't mind running to the hardware store. it does not come with drill bits as advertised!!!
2,Misleading picture,We ordered the Drill that came with the drills attached. I called and told them and they reshipped the same exact wrong drill that came without any drills. Not very happy about my purchase.
5,VERSATILE,"I didn't like it on the bicycle, but it works great on the lawn mower to hold the basics: spark plug wrench,few screw drivers and wrenches.Not water proof,but not important to me."
2,"It It Just Me, or does this movie really stink?","This movie stank. The acting was okay, but nothing great. The plot was pitiful. Since no one would be interested in a poorly written sceenplay about two nice guys meeting in LA, they threw in a very poor twist involving switched on-line identities. This one went into my give away pile immediately after viewing. Watch Auntie Mame instead."
2,"Cowboy is cute, but...","This movie is a step closer to gay cinema not sucking. The three main leads weren't bad and the production values were pro. Unfortunately, the script was predictable and clich'."
3,Nothing Special,"This movie was okay, nothing special.Filled with lots of stereotypes...The hot jock, who gets everybody.The brainy nerd who can't get a date.The cute Southern boy with the really bad Southern drawl.The old Queen who's there for a shoulder to cry on.And the ""sounds like witchy"" fag hag best friend of the main character....and less then great acting or was it a really bad script?Find it and rent it or borrow mine, but don't waste the money buying it."
2,Does not work,"It didnt do anything to my face, couldnt see any changes, but thank god it hadn't give me any terrible side effects. In all honesty, i dont take it every single day so if you're a risk taker feel free to give it a shot"
3,Certainly not Everything You Need to Know,"I agree with A. Brannon ""MLC Rider"" to a lot of fluff and not enought subtance. The book is mostly Doc Frazier's travelog. I was looking for information on how to travel, with what and how to do it safely.This book is certainly not Everything You Need to Know.I think the better book is:The Essential Guide to Motorcycle Travel: Tips, Technology, Advanced Techniquesby Dale Coyner"
4,Elegant yet simple pen!,"I've been using the Parker Latitude for quite a while now and I must say that I'm completely addicted. I'm not a big fan of super fancy pens but I do like a good ball point that can write elegantly. I'd been searching for a ballpoint that wrote well, had good balance, refillable, and yet still simple with a hint of class. This Parker Latitude possesses all these qualities. It's a great everyday writing instrument, wonderfully durable, and doesn't have the problems associated with fountain pens (ink drying out or other nib issues etc). I think the biggest seller for me is the fact that a ballpoint can be be fine point. I really dislike the thicker lines of traditional ballpoints. I'm incredibly happy with this Latitude ballpoint and use it everyday!"
4,Not bad,"Not a masterpiece but surely a decent book well worth reading, Bova certainly knows how to write an entertaining story!"
4,"Too political, but a fun read","While I don't get involved in man-made government, I think Vote for Larry was a fun read. Sadly, I hear the third book will have no appearance by Janine though.One thing Janet, don't fall into the rut of a lot of young adult books on todays market and have Larry involved in pre-martial sex in the third book, will ya?"
1,Horrible,"In additon to having absolutly no label(hard tell which side is up), out of my 3 CDRWs the media is recognized in only one of them. The one that can see the media can only burn at 2x. I bought these to pad another purchase to get free shipping but I would suggest padding it with something else."
1,Expensive Coasters,Too much to spend for coasters that don't even look good. Lets not talk about the usage as CDs at all.
1,Save your money and trouble,"I bought this machine full of hopes that it would improve my cooking by allowing my marination times to be shortened.It turned out that the contraption never works. The vacuum lid was never tight as it should have been, becoming detached every time I tried to use it. The resulting BBQ sauce all over the kitchen which is not my sort of entertainment.After sitting lame for four months, I took it to the city dump and left it there in the hope that will be put to sleep before a hapless cook can find it.I am very disappointed indeed!"
5,works unreal,I bought this because my brother has one and it works incredibly well saves a lot of time its instant and the flavor is inside the meats a lot better than if you let it stand for days. if i had to knock the product its seems to feels a little expensive but well worth it.
1,Not Good,"This DVD was not good at all. It looked very amateur, like something I would have put together. Interviews constantly from two random probably local bands who no one even knows. Disappointing as the cover looks really good but I couldn't even watch the whole thing."
2,"should have been titled ""Let's Make Paper-Chain Dolls""","This 1978 photo-illustrated book for very young children runs about 20 pages. One or two lines of text in big print accompany each photo of hands doing the instructions.This book covers a few suggestions for making paper-chain dolls only. It does that well enough if you've never seen it done before. But if a child can use scissors already, she or he should be able to read and follow more complex and interesting instructions."
1,Vivonic love affair over,"I loved this software; I liked the workout circuits; the food track is great. So...then I got a Palm Tungsten E2 and kaput! Nothing. It just sits there. I would even spend money on an upgrade, but when I try to click through to Tech Support to find one...kaput! No Tech Support and no answers. It works on my desktop, which is even more frustrating. I think this is very well designed, too bad they stiffed us! MM"
3,Not for the Hard-Core,"I'll start by saying this program does work and is extremely easy to use, but don't go in to it expecting miracles. I guess I was looking for something that would give me a little more feedback and a few more options. For people sick of using calorie counting books - this is a great addition to your life, but if you are looking for anything more - keep looking."
1,"Not ""Remastered"" - needs to change listing","This is a good enough CD, but it is not what is advertised. It is not remastered at all. In fact, this is just a re-release of the Cerati-Melero ""Colores Santos (remixes)"" CD, which has already been on the market for years. Don't be fooled or pay high import prices since this is not the original CD."
5,Prelude to Cerati's current works,"The song ""Vuelta por el Universo"" alone is worth the buy. But you also get ""Cozumel"", ""Tu Medicina"" and ""Colores Santos"", the song that Cerati dedicated to his father. The surreal lyrics get along very well with the dreamy music. Daniel Melero did a nice job here for Cerati's the one you really notice playing and singing. You can tell by some songs in this album that he wanted to get into electronic music since 1993..."
5,Amazing Simple Organic Worship,"This album, like all of them, will bring you quickly into the presence of our Father.The song are all from the Psalms and focus us greatly on how good the Father is, how much He loves us and how we can respond to Him. Being guitar and drum focused this album draws you in."
5,Awesome God Praise,100 Portraits and Waterdeep have an uncanny way of presenting music that sounds like something God would want to hear! They sing Psalms and praise in such a fresh and simple way. I just love this CD. The simplicity of the songs seems to enable a deeper connection to the Lord while I listen.
5,A favorite,"My toddler absolutely loves this book. He still doesn't say much but can sound out Lulu and that makes him so happy. The illustrations are beautiful because of the bold colors. The thick pages makes it easy for him to look at the book on his own, too."
2,fine,"The book was not the editon I was looking for, it's not the same they show in the picture, but it works just the same."
5,One of my favorites!,"Joel's Window is incredible. Charlie Hall has an inexpressible anointing from God. Charlie's lyrics are pure and honest. The music makes your heart beat faster even if the tempo is slow. This cd is deep and worshipful, and I don't mean it makes you worship the cd but Jesus Christ our Savior. Thank you, Charlie, for sharing your gift. Charlie's other cd's are just as incredible. Try to get them. Praise God."
5,Pretty slick !!,"This stuff really seems to work , and doesn't make the bow all slimy or sticky . Stayed slick in freezing deer stand, good product and cheap too."
4,Wax for the Crossbow,"Works like chapstick, but not a five star only because I wish it was a little more denser. Did not even know it was a three pack. Yea, an extra bonus."
4,Good wax,Just waxed my crossbow string went on easy but you will run through this stuff quick glad I got the three pack. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I thought it was going to be bigger and would last me awhile if I shoot everyday for half an hour this will last me a week I'm estimating. It's about the size of a chapstick.
2,Didn't care too much for it.,"I played the original ""Scorge of the Slave Lords"" and loved it. Smackdown the Slavelords I found to be a major let down. The beginning of the adventure was like a rail road. You HAD to get captured and no matter what your characters did, they were looted and made into slaves. The dungeon after you escape was almost word for word the same as the original, there was nothing new inside of it. If you own the original, do yourself a favor and just covert that to hackmaster, or buy another hackmaster product for the same level like Robinloft or Slaughterhouse Indigo."
5,Best CD I've Bought,"The band has never failed to impress me. I heard about them from a message board back when they were a tiny tiny group barely starting on Drive-Thru. When they finally released their LP I bought it right away, and I haven't stopped listening to it! Unlike other bands, every track on this CD is a standout track. My personal favorite is ""A Goodnight's Sleep"" because of the emotion this band can convey. This is the most amazing CD you can buy, and it doesn't matter what genre you're into, everyone can appreciate this album."
3,Only listened to one song,"Okay, I've only heard one song by them, which was the only single off this album. I also saw the video for it. I forgot what the title of it was though, but it was a decent song. It's good for the first minute or so, but after a while it gets really annoying, and the lead singer needs to buy a shirt that actually fits him and doesn't look like it's just going to rip any second because it was made for a 13 year old."
4,"Good, exatly the same thing, but good",i cant say much about this CD ill just say this im glad i like this music because the hole CD is exatly the same song over and over with some little changes in key. But nontheless some good musac
5,totally awsome cd,i went to warped tour in vancouver and i went to see these guys play and i was really surprised at how good they were i only had 1$ i could spend so i bought there sticker and they signed it and it actully seemed like they were really happy to and they were good guys so when i got back to kelowna i went to a&b sound and bought there cd and its the only thing i have been listing to since i have got it
1,the 'punk' equivalent of the Backstreet Boys,"If I could give this CD zero, or a negative amount, of stars, I would. Of all the terrible bands to emerge in the past 40 years, and there are alot of them (Aerosmith, The Ataris,Coldplay) they rank among the worst of the worst. If Poison was considered pop-rock 15 years ago, then The Starting line is flat out bubblegum. The songs are all the same, same formulas, same themes. No real instrumental talent can be found; and the catchy songs are forgettable. Also, all these songs have pretty much been performed by countless other bands. The lead singer is totally a word that rhymes with maggot. And as for that one dude that sings back up vocals, well he's just dreamy, i mean, nevermind. Look for this band to be on the Rock vs. Pop Reunion tour in 2023 with The Backstreet Boys and Warrant."
5,just amazing,"i know this review is like forever after the cd came out, but i just have to explain how just utterly amazing this record is. with Kenny pumping out his heart filled lyrics and catchy melodies, and Matt&Mike with their zingy guitars in riffs, it's almost impossible to not get their songs stuck in your head for hours on end days. and keep an eye out for their acoustic ep coming out sometime in august."
2,i don't get it...,"Okay, I see everyone rating this CD 5 out of 5 stars, and I have to say, I don't understand it at all. If this is your favorite CD, you either have bad taste, or you're 12 years old.Don't get me wrong, I liked this when I bought it, but I still liked Simple Plan and Good Charlotte back then. Some of the stuff on this CD is okay. But their EP is way better (maybe that's just because I like their stuff better when it's acoustic).But I wouldn't recommend this CD. I think the lyrics are really lacking, and I think lyrics are the most important part of the CD. If you want to download a couple good songs, try The Best of Me, Almost There Going Nowhere, Decisions Decisions, and Left Coast Envy."
5,One of the Best T.V. Shows Becomes a Soundtrack,"This is a great soundtrack. Some of the music is from the popular t.v. series. The best tracks are #4: Come Along, #11: My Life, and #12: Say Goodnight. The other tracks are okay, but don't hit my favorite level. I've never really heard some of those songs on the actual program. All in all, it's a really good C.D.. :)"
4,Solid EP,"Solid effort compared to their other albums. Raw EP, but is enjoyable because of the bands typical amazing energy that flows into your body listening to the tracks. Also, its strange of all ATDI album music samples you can listen to. only El Gran Orgo is able to play its samples. Not a must have, but if you're a die hard its worth it."
5,"Solid quality, great value for money","Purchased this privacy set to replace one from another brand on which a plastic part inside the lock failed. I was very very surprised when this showed up, it is solid, the plating is solid, no plastic parts inside, and was very easy to fit. Definitely recommend this brand especially at this price."
3,Design is half right,"I have a g-tube so all my meds have to be crushed to fit through the tubing. I have literally worn out pill crushers. I got this one thinking it would be easier on my hands to use since I take 40 pills a day. The top half is easy to grip but the bottom half hurts my hands to hold. The sharp edges/ridges on the bottom really cut into my hand. Why didn't the top design and materials get repeated on the bottom? Also, the internal action of the crusher doesn't crush the pills completely. The several times I have tried I have ended up pouring the pieces into my old worn out crusher to finish the job. I can't believe there isn't a crusher out there that works, is durable and is easy to grip. This one almost got it half right."
1,Doesn't work on really hard pills,One needs a proper grinder like a salt grinder for such pills. Don't waste your time and money. Perhaps one should use a grinder that has sharp edges.
5,"Best compact, portable pill crusher","I have a daughter who eats via a g-tube so we need to crush all of her medication. We've tried many pill crushers and with the exception of a mortar and pestle, this one beats them all. A mortar and pestle will crush pills finer in less time, but it's a bit hard to travel with. For compactness and portability, nothing beats this pill crusher. With time, it will start to not work as well, I'm not sure why, but it's inexpensive so I don't mind buying another one. I find each one lasts at least a year, if not longer."
5,Works well in crushing meds.,"I bought this to crush meds for my grandmother, as she has trouble swallowing pills.This little device works well as it allows you to get a good grip when turning the top to crush the meds."
2,hard on hands,This item works well for small pills but it is difficult to grind larger pills Crushing larger pills requires holding the sharp edges of the bottom and applying a fair amount of pressure to turn the top. I regret purchasing this because it kills my hands.
5,Gripping Reading!!,"The Agent of Judgement is one of the best thrillers -- if not THE best thriller -- I've ever read. I have read it twice now and was just as gripped the second time I read it as the first. Mr. Rice has done an excellent job of weaving the web in such a way as to keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat! Read it, you'll love it. From A GREAT FAN"
3,Was something missing?,"The title says ""Seven Experiments,"" so I was hoping and expecting that the video contained 7 experiments, but in reality, it only contained 3. I bought the video being particularly interested in the ""phantom limb"" experiment but was disappointed to find that it was not included.I have not read the book version, but hopefully it covers all 7 topics.Otherwise, it had entertainment value for the non-scientific type."
5,Pure beauty,"This book tells the original story that started the Pan legend before TV and movies hooked it into something else. The story remains timeless as expected of a classic, but this time awesome new illustrations by Raquel Jaramillo will send parents and children to Neverland in spite of the cost. Computer graphics enhance the illustrator's classy depictions and add to the wonder of a tale that remains ageless and beautiful. The youngster inside all of us will love this great rendition that the author would have loved to read and show to his friend's children.Harriet Klausner"
5,"Unabriged, awsome pictures, this book is a must have!","ThIS IS THE COOLEST BOOK1 iT'S THE ORIGINAL NOVEL BY j.m. Brie and It has incerdible picTures! Raquael Jaramello had children and adults, pose for the pictures featured in this book (I'm tINKERBELL) sHE USED COMPUTER GRAFICS TO TRASPORT US TO NEVERLAND. (sHE GAVE ME pOINTY EARS AND WINGS!) i REALLY HOPE YOU BY THIS BOOK AND ENJOY READING IT (AND LOOKING AT THE PICTURES) bYE!"
4,Almost perfect,"Paris is a great live disc but one of Supertramp's most rocking songs (Goodbye stranger) is missing although sure it was performed in the concert. Instead of this cool song we've got average material like A Soapbox Opera or the non stellar You Started Laughing. Other than that, I have no complaints about this cd. The group plays tight, the quality sound is very good and the songs have more power and life to them than in the generally inferior studio renditions.Too bad that the footage of this gig is not available (We are teased with some of it on the Story So Far video and dvd). It must be great.This is Supertramp at the height of their power and popularity. After this recording, nothing would be the same and they'd fall in the downhill slide with the Famous Last Words cd and from which they would never recover."
2,Male bias,"This book is written along with 99% of self help books that focuses on the male as the abusive partner. It is as if we live in a society where very rarely the women is the perpetrator of physical and verbal abuse. This of course, plays into politics and womens liberation, whereas it is almost as if they are entitled to act this way. I would imagine that there is a rather large percent of women abusers in today's civilization. In a society where single parents, mostly women, are the caretakers, there must be a very strong pattern developing in the present and the future. The book is an answer to prayers where it does in fact focus on significant issues. It is not the simplest read, it is written with the self help confusing format.Shame on Stosny for not focusing on women as the perpetrators. I did not read the entire book cover to cover, but I only found one example."
3,"Interesting Take on ""Hamlet""","I love the play ""Hamlet"" and I love opera. There is much good to say about this production. Visually it is stunning and original. Sets are minimal, but perfect and varied. The costumes are brilliantly conceived. The lighting puts it all together and varies the pallet when needed.The acting is good not great. Keenlyside is one note as are his arias. I've read nothing but raves for Natalie Dessay, but I find her a bit too mousy with a self-obsessed delivery. She thinks she is the only one onstage. The Gertrude was magnificent, as was the Ghost of Hamlet's Father. Claudius was a little to commonplace for me--certainly not the monster he should be.Thomas' opera is uneven. He does not know how to write for men. However, his work for Ophelia and Gertrude is remarkable. But this is Hamlet's play and opera. No wonder all the reviewers are so ga-ga over Dessay. I do think they have overlooked Gertrude though. As far as I'm concerned, when she was onstage, no one could top her."
4,finger tip towel review,"I needed additional towels to blend with an overall rose motif and found these Croscill Rose Garden towels to be exactly what fit. In addition, the quality is very good."
1,Too much Conversation Text & Less photos,"this book always showed up while i search about ""Games History"". no inside sample. too much text. i prefer more photos"
4,Quicki Pie,"When I was a kid we used to call this a Quickie Pie! I was on a search to find a Quickie Pie and came up with this item on Amazon. Close Enough!! I am happy with this purchase. Just one thing. I remember the Quickie Pie being a little larger and held most of the bread slices, or is it that the bread slices are larger now a days??"
5,Killer Graphics,"I bougnt this game locally, at Staples.And it works flawlessly in Windows XP,Its upgradable and it has a left handed option, for us ""Southpaws"" And its pretty easy.If I can go 19 under par after 18 holes, you probably can too.Robert J. Schuller"
1,Stay away from this one.,"I am using this book for my mechanical engineering course and it has been a disaster. I am constantly looking for other sources to help with current topics as this particular book does not cover them enough. There are also catastrophic typos in some of the example problems. The worst part is the fact that the authors chose to save paper because they keep referring you to figures from previous chapters. It is by far the worst book I had to use in my degree which is quite an achievement. I read amazon reviews prior to buying books and oftentimes I disagree with poor book ratings (some students are complaining about their own inefficiencies). However, I find myself writing my first review because I cannot take this horribly written book any longer. If you really have to buy the book for a course good luck to you, otherwise stay away from this literature."
4,Well worth the read,"This book is an eye opener for those who are in the world of executive protection. For the beginner it puts you on the right path, included with the things to do and not to do. Congrats to the author.A fellow specialistScott, EPS,CPS"
2,Interesting insght - but no more,"This book is interesting reading but it seems the authour places more details in the chapters that he is personaley interested in such as weapons training and not going into any particular datils of more routine opperations such a protection tecnuiques, which if well followed such if not illiminate but sereverly reduce the need of a drawn weapon.... not a bad book to get a flavour of but severely lacks details. on the other end of the spectrum what can one expect out of a publication but the writing style was interesting but i would prefer ainstead spliting the books into 3 or more books with a higher detail and cover price"
2,Race to the bottom,"I purchased this unit several years ago. Nice finish on the parts you see but valve has a lot of plastic parts that should be metal. There is a plastic limiter device that hits a metal wedge that stops the valve from turning past the off position. If you go too far, the water comes back on. This metal wedge cuts into the plastic stop so that over time it becomes very worn. I had to order two replacement stops. They are covered under warranty but still... A hastle to replace."
1,Not one good track,My husband and I enjoy almost all Italian music. We purchased this cd hoping to add to our collection - what a disappointment - the worst of the worst. Not one single good track - an absolute waste of money.
5,DEATH F@#$%NG METAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yeah, I know that was a litte over the top but that's how enthusiastic I am about this exciting new Swedish band. I am surprised at how underrated these guys are. I like relatively newer bands such as Arch enemy, Children of Bodom, and Opeth and I think that The forsaken could easily fit in with the afformentioned bands as far as greatness goes. The forsaken's mix of brutal/technical Death metal and Melodic Death metal is perfected on all of their albums (which, as of this writing, covers two albums). The music is loaded with hooks (I've got ""Embedded insanity"" stuck in my head right now!) and Anders Sjoholm has an excellent agressive voice. These cats have definetly done their homework.The future looks good for quality Death metal! ROCK HARD AND BANG THE HEAD THAT DOESN'T BANG!"
4,"Interesting and Amusing. A Bit Too Misantrhopic, though!","Yes, I suppose that a fellow sitting in a tree chopping branches, who chops the one he's sitting on, falling to his death, is morbidly funny. We can find humor all over, and a good laugh can help make friendships, too! The ""Darwin Awards"" is turning into a minor literary franchise, and it is among the cleverest set of current books you can read! People who unwittingly arrange their own demise can be darkly humorous too! However, at times this book (and the others in the series,too) seems to go a bit close to the edge of nasty mockery! But since I'm giving it 4-stars, even I can succumb to these stinging commentaries on the pure stupidity of the human species!"
3,"Funny, but not as original anymore","This new volume of commemerating humor through human stupidity shows one of the problems of this kind of business. The human is only so stupid, and sometimes, there will be a dry spell where not many spectacular dumb actions will happen. While this one has a few gems in it (delayed ignition of gunpower = robber's head blown off), it lacks the advantage of originality and shock value of the first book. Maybe they should consider expanding the darwin awards to other moronic things (social customs, quotes, stupid government and laws) to keep the content fresh and the laughs flowing."
4,Good Book,"This book really caught my interest quick. The short stories entertained me so much that I read the book in just 2 days. Near the end I started getting a little bored with it, but that's probably only because I was reading it so quickly. I first picked up the book because of the emails that go around with bits of the stories in them, that's what got me interested. I would recommend this book to a friend, but only for entertainament purposes. Overall this was a good book and highly recommended."
4,it works,It is easier using this to clean my blinds than doing each slate one by one. Also you don't have to take your blinds down to dust them when you use this item.
2,Not recommended,I bought this product to clean my blinds. The item was flimsy and did not do the job. I feel that I wasted my money.
5,The Slowness of Muisc,"For the music itself, it is a beauty, but not abstract trio jazz. The bassist provides a moderate and less aggressive support to the body with and occasionally randomly arranged solos, while the drummer is felt rather than heard for most time. The subtle piano improvisations mesh elegant whispers in an atmosphere of slowness. What does slowness mean to music? I barely realized that before I knew the band Red House Painters from San Francisco, playing music as slow as if time has frozen, and was labeled as sadcore music.Yes! The band definitely gives me a cross-genre feeling of Red House Painter, but tells a different story - a story about the beauty of slowness of music."
2,50 missing pages make it useless,"I got my copy in early November 2006 and discovered pages 181 - 228 are missing. No sign that they were cut out or torn out, so it must have been a binding error.I am missing everything between ""one-sided"" and ""Simoniz"" :-)I have used the AP Stylebook for 30 years and love it, but be careful if you order the 2004 edition."
1,oops! wrong edition,"Perhaps my mistake, but I wanted at least a 2003 edition, not the 2001 one I already own. The subcontractor told me I can return the one I got, but I presume it will cost me more in shipping than a copy would cost me here in town."
4,Excellent for the price - Wife loved it,"This was an anniversary gift for my wife. She is not a woman who likes flashy things, but was very impressed with the diamonds and the sapphire case. I got lots of Anniversary 'special time' in return. ;-)"
5,"Stunning, beautiful documentary","Bravo! This life's work by Frank Espada is a beautiful and moving documentary of humanity. The stunning photographs tell a compelling story on their own. The stories that accompany the photos tell the heart wrenching experiences of a proud people that have contributed so much to our history and culture, yet at the same time continue to be neglected. This book should be in the curriculum of every high school, college and university across the country, as it certainly chronicles an important chapter of civil rights and human rights in American history.What draws you into this experience are the masterful photographs captured by one of the world's most important documentary photographers. If you are a lover of documentary photography, this book is for you."
4,Comprehensive,"This guide provides prices for over 10,000 cards and will be useful for collectors, dealers, and novices. The book highlights the most collected categories, and the artist-signed chapter covers over 250 pages. The 900 postcard images, though reduced and in black and white, are useful; my favorites included the Krampus cards, Alligator border card, and the Halloween cards are a real treat. Mashburn provides short biographies of some of the artists and publishers (and even an introduction to Krampus). Although Mashburn does present some useful guidelines on topical, views, and roadside America I thought those chapters were too short in light of the vast number of cards available. Mashburn also includes references for more specific topics also."
5,POSTCARDS,"THIS BOOK HELPED ME TO EVALUATE MY POSTCARDS COLLECTION. IT INCLUDES ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW, FOR ALL KINDS OF POSTCARDS."
1,nEEDED: ONE GOOD PROOFREADER,"While reviewing the reviews for this book from others who have purchased it, I was amazed to see that no one remarked on the very obvious mistakes. Being a novice knitter, after completing 2 of the items in the book, I found that to avoid having these mistakes jump out at me while in the process of knitting the item, it would be better if I went over the instructions beforehand. I found so many mistakes, obvious mistakes, like not knowing that a garter stitch is a ""knit every row"". It was beginning to seem like a nightmare. You purchase all the equipment and then have to pray that the other instructions are correct. This book needs a good proofreader."
1,waste of trees,how could anyone give this trash 5 stars? This was the worst book I have ever read. Did anyone proof read this before this was published?
2,"great dog, so so book","As an advertisement for the bernese breed, this is great. As a book, it is very superficial. I too have bernese as therapy dogs and have been doing it for years. Mr. Schrieber needs to do more than 12 visits to really get into it. Also, he needs to delve deeper into his feelings. I think it is wonderful that he will travel such a long way to do this work, it is very important work. A little more work on the book would have been good."
3,top choice,Excellent value for money. Good design and execution.Comfortable to wear. Can highly reccomend them
1,Terrible! Not worth 1 penny!,This thing is terrible. Once the tube is filled the handle is heavier than the roller so its very difficult to push along the walls. You can't get the same angles that you can with a standard roller. And clean up - what a MESS! It took me over 20 minutes to clean this thing up. The directions said to flush with water about 5 times - it took about 20 times to get the tube clean. This thing is going right back to Lowes - its not worth the time nor the money.
4,Works good,"The people who give this tool a bad review should hire someone to paint.Painting requires a certain amount of patience. This tool is for people who like to work smart not hard. Hints, when your done painting it's gotta be thoroughly cleaned. You have to use a small amount of petroleum jelly on the seals. Rolls the paint on smooth"
2,Added work,This system does not draw paint well even when lubricated properly with vaseline. It took six tries to draw any paint at all and then only filled half full. Thinning the paint helped but added to the splatter problem.
1,245 pages instead of 25,"Am I the only reviewer who wonders why Back Bay Books of Little-Brown didn't use an editor? This is repetitious beyond belief. The characters are also beyond belief. A character named ""Falk"" is the first person narrator who tells the same empty story over and over is so twisted and shallow as he kills arabs in the name of protecting Jews that I would have liked to shoot him myself, not just to put him out of his misery but to punish him for wasting my time. Yes, I did finish the book, if that's what you want to call it."
3,not a easy read,Is very hard to read on a Kindle. The indexing and options to locate a specific name do not work well together. might be OK just as a reference but it does not help with Genealogy research.
4,Sweet & Short,This book is basically too short to be an indepth study of the historical Jesus and the early church. Keeping this in mind though the book is pretty good. I'd recommend it to a person who is just beginning to learn about the historical Jesus.
5,Great CD,"If you loved the movie, you'll love this CD. Almost all the songs are top notch,Most of them are country but a few rock."
5,Disney's The Country Bears,"This is a great soundtrack, it's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do"
4,Horrors,"I love this book, it's perfect for reading one story each day :) It reminds me of Stephen King's short stories, which is a good thing!"
2,Okay but nothing to write home about,"Basic plot: a historian discovers Stalin's diary, then goes off on a three day trek across Russia to discover a shocking truth about Stalin. The book was okay, but the pace was a little slow, and I didn't care for so many descriptions of modern day Russia. I wouldn't call this a ""thriller"" as it is missing the requisite suspense and action. I could have done with more pace, more crisp dialogue and definitely more action."
3,Bang! Fizzle! Flop!,"When I first began reading Archangel (my first Robert Harris read), I was captivated. The opening scene set by Harris is incredible and really draws you into the story. At first I couldn't put it down. Then, a little over 3/4 of the way in, I couldn't pick it up. Harris blew it by revealing the books mystery too early. Don't get me wrong, all in all, the book was entertaining. The concept behind it is very intriguing. However, all the suspense and action throughout the book is brought to a head too quickly. This leaves a lull between when the books secrets are unlocked and the finish. Harris did manage to script a small twist in the end, but it was a day late and a dollar short. All in all, I would recommend this novel to anyone who is into historical/alternate reality type novels. It is interesting and reads very well. However, be prepared to be slightly disappointed at the end."
2,"Archangel intriguing, but not a good read","Whereas Fatherland and Enigma were fascinating, Archangel is little more than readable. The story never meshes. It's not until the 250th page or so that the reader finally understands the whole plot. For the bulk of the book I was struggling to understand what the big hubbub was about.Despite the confusion, the book holds together well until the very end. The final 20 pages are mind-boggling. I had to re-read it several times to understand what was happening. It's as if Harris was rushed to finish the book and compacted several chapters worth of information into one. Disappointing."
2,"Great start, dreadful ending","Give Harris credit where it's due -- I spent almost 10 years in Moscow and he has certainly done his homework, setting the scene for what should be a gripping tale of what happened to Stalin's secret notebook. But the book veers wildly off track as it approaches the climax and I hate to think what Harris was smoking when he wrote the last few chapters. What a disappointment"
4,Quick Paced Intelligent Thriller,"As a lover of history, I found this book to be quite disturbing (in a good sense). It is fast paced (I finished it in two nights)and offers the reader a good look into the past as well as the present while being wrapped around a scary fictional scenerio. The author does a great job of introducing the story and leading you through the twists and turns of a tortured modern Russia that refuses to let go of its communist, dictatorial past. Again this book comes to a disturbing sequence of events (one that is probably not out of the question in today's Russia) that will leave you both highly satisfied in the book and deeply disturbed at the attitudes of Russia."
3,Archangel falls short of Harris's previous offerings,"As in Fatherland, Archangel is based on a 'What if...' precept, this time pertaining to Stalin's last secret, something which has the potential for a wholly engrossing novel. Sadly, the book has turned out unsatisfying for the first 300 pages, with a few twists thrown in too late and too unconvincingly. The last 100 pages are more apace, but lack the 'thrill factor' of both 'Fatherland' and 'Enigma',which left the reader reading through splayed fingers. In all fairness, Harris makes some salient points about the dilemma of the new Russia, and the frightening popularity of Stalin among both Russians and Western scholars, who find it only too easy to excuse his crimes. The ending of this book reads as if Robert Harris had to finish before teatime and ran out of ideas."
3,It reminds me of Joshua Son of None,"While I had a hard time getting started, I thought the work was enjoybale enough. Yes, it stereotypes many things in our world--from the Russian people to the Russian society, but it still provides an enjoyable read. While I did enjoy the book, the plot is a little over used--Joshua Son of None (the cloning of Pres. Kennedy) and numerous Adolf Hitler offspring books available."
2,Compelling premise - very poor follow-through,"The premise of this book - How would the face of modern Russia change if Stalin's attrocities were ever brought to light (through the discovery of his secret journel) - is a very compelling theme. Harris starts us on the journey down this path in a suspensefull manner that makes the book hard to put down for the first 100 pages. Past that, the plot falls apart and becomes one non-sensicle farce after another. Past the first 100 pages, all character development (such that there is) stops and Harris seems to change his tone and begins to regard the reader as a teenage girl reading ""The Nancy Drew Mysteries"". This book has a wonderfull premise, a passing beginning, but in the end, falls well short of it's promise.Having read other works by Robert Harris, I would have to say this: If you are a Harris fan, you will probably not be too disapointed; if you are a first time Harris reader, I would pass on this one."
4,Nice Beach/Plane Fare,"Good airplane or beach reading, this thriller hangs on the premise that Stalin had a personal diary that no one ever read, and which has remained hidden since his death. A U.S. historian/journalist in semi-disrepute is invited to a conference about Stalin in Moscow where he is approached by an old man with just such a wild tale. Everything proceeds to careen through 4 wild days from the ""new Russia"" of pricey Moscow bars and hookers to the bleak forests of Archangel in the far north. It's a good ride, imparting lots of useful factoids about Stalin and his current appeal while delivering a solid Robert Ludlumish conspiracy thriller."
4,"A View from Moscow, Russia","Archangel is one of not so many books available today, where author really understands what's going on in today's Russia, gives his interpretation about the history and its impact on today and it is really interesting to read about the events in Moscow living in Moscow in less than 1 km. from the Beria mansion. The other great book that should be mentioned in this context is ""Snow Wolf"" by Glenn Meade that also covers the last days of Stalin."
3,Starts out Great,"I'll cut to the chase here....This books starts out great and Harris paints an accurate and strong portrayal of modern day Russia. He also does a pretty good job from a historical perspective when dealing with Stalin. This novel could have been excellent had a different approach been taken and had the plot not taken a turn for the worse. Towards th end the book really goes downhill and ends up borderline ridiculous. Had a more subtle and realistic approach been taken by Harris, it would have made the read much more enjoyable for me. For the first 250 pages I was hooked and that's why I am giving it three stars."
2,Lumbering towards disappointment,"I sat down on a flight to Chicago, looking forward to demolishing the new Robert Harris. 'Enigma' had been a reasonable read, if a little over done. Sadly, 'Archangel' was hard work. Great concept, and a pretty good initial hook, with Fluke Kelso uncovering this slender link to the hidden memoirs of Stalin. The first fifty or so pages sets up the premise and the story builds with some momentum....but by page 150, it still feels like set up!Harris's style takes a bit of digesting and does not make for a fluid, easy read. His knowledge of history is great and I now feel better briefed on Russia's legend and culture. But his characters are a bit wooden and I never got to connect with Fluke Kelso.The final few chapters do have some pace and some action, but it's more like Rambo than the 'great literary thriller' the cover boasted! Harris can do better and will do better. Harris is a writer worth sticking with - but not if he serves up another of these!"
3,"Very good beginning, petered out at the end","The premise of this book is great! Imagine, Stalin's missing notebook! The first half of the book revolves around the hunt for the notebook, and it is thrilling.Unfortunately, the revelations of the book and the story that follows is a little on the outlandish and less interesting.A decent way to spend a rainy afternoon."
3,Great soud but not durable,"I bought my minidisc player about 6 months ago. I do a great deal of travelling and was happy to have something so portable and light to carry with me. However, I found that the sharp MD player is not as durable as many other brands such as Sony. Moving from place to place I found that it was easily susceptible to dust, even with meticulous care. Within two months of being in the environment, my MD player began to skip ad now it works when it chooses to. a co-worker bought a Sony MD about the same time I did. His operated smoothly in this environment in the exact same conditions. The sound is great but be aware if you plan to do more with it than listen to it in your home."
1,Not so good,"I bought this minidisc player about two years ago, and since then, it's broken twice. The first time, I sent it in and the people at sharp fixed it. The second time it broke, the tried to fix it, but when they sent it back to me, it still didnt work. Now, the lid to the battery holder has come off, and so it is completely worthless. This same thing happend to a friend who had the exact same model"
4,"Great performance, Bad editing","The good:Linkin Park is an awesome live act. Tight, energetic, strong vocals, a real layered sound achieved instrumentally and with Mr Hahn's manual scratching, keyboards and occasional loop. The sound on the DVD and CD sounds great to me. I'm not an expert at spoting overdubs, but I didn't hear anything suspicious. I also like that you get both a DVD and a CD in a reasonably priced package.The bad:The video was edited for teenagers. I felt like I was watching MTV cribs or something. Ridiculous. The cuts were so fast and jerky, it was hard to get a fix on anything. As a drummer, I like to check out the drummer and see what he's doing. It was just about worthless in that regard. The occasional drum shots lasted about a second. Of course I would like a multiple angle feature, which it didn't have on any songs.So, I can't give the video 5 stars, but would recommend it to anyone who likes live hard rock."
4,British Invasion Gems,This CD contains many of the real hits from the 60s British Invasion plus a few interesting songs that were not hits in Canada but are important to the British scene of the 60s. I can now put away the scratchy vinyl 45s. All the recordings are the original versions and really good quality. I'm definitely pleased with this disc.
3,plier type flaring tool,"This is a good tool if you only have a couple of flares to do. If you have more or are not mechanically inclined you will find this tool challenging. It MUST be adjusted for each size of tubing you are working with, so be prepared for a challenge. I bought this tool because I only had one flare to make and the cheapest one I could find around here was in the $70.00 range. So for me it worked out ok but I can't recommend it."
5,Garnet Ring,"This ring is a very good value for the money. The garnets are paler than they appear in the picture, and the ring is very thin, but I am happy with it. I have received many compliments!"
1,Horrendous,"Vapid and vacuous. This needs to be buried in a snowdrift and, with any mercy, never found again.The entire album went by without me doing anything but get more and more annoyed...that I bought it.F...you know what I mean?"
4,Focused Absurdity,"Nmperign's 2nd is a good indication of where the future of improvised music is headed. Sharp, crystalline fractures of sound, with fragments of disembodied melody meted out in small amounts. ""Laughter of Birds Bloody Mud"" adds tapeloop maestro Jason Lescalleet creating a dense wall of disintegrating noise, while the guests on ""The Moon Is A Clear Mark of Midnight"" (shakuhachi and percussion) make for an almost orchestral lushness. I managed to catch them live a few months back and their live set was really tight. Given their focus and seriousness onstage, I thought they might be a bit pretentious, but I talked with them a bit after the show and in fact they are ridiculous characters (showing a mild predilection for off-color humor and absurd antics)! Great stuff - check it out!"
5,Helpful Reflections,"I have been practicing non-violent communication in a group for over a year now and thought I would like to write a daily reflections guide for practicing non-violent communication. When I shared this with the group facilitator she told me about this book. I highly recommend purchasing Mary MacKenzie's book; it gives practical suggestions on how to deal with common relationship issues. Plus, she also gives valuable insights for more mindful living each day."
1,Save your money and time!,If you would like to spend your money and time to listen to someone lecturing you about the obvious buy this book. You won't learn antyhing from this book that yuo did not know other than the fact that it's inappropriate to order pasta at a lunch interview.
5,Great book,"I learned a lot from this book, not only things about job interview, but also stuff about how to communicate with people."
5,great book,"this book puts a perspective on detroit that many do not take, that detroit was and is a great city. the book is easy to read, very thourogh, and is accentuated well by photography. a good coffee table book."
4,VERY NICE!,"WE PURCHASED THIS FOR OUR 2 LITTLE GUYS. THE YOUNGEST IS ALWAYS CURIOUS, I WAS AFRAID HE WOULD TRY TO CHEW HIS WAY OUT. IF HE GETS MAD FOR BEING IN TO LONG, HE LIKES TO CHEW THINGS. HE HAS NOT TRIED TO CHEW ON THIS AT ALL. GREAT PRODUCT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. IT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND NOT AN EYE SORE LIKE SOME OF THEM CAN BE"
4,Sturdy and attractive,"I love this crate, it was well worth the money. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the top doesn't open, but otherwise my dog loves it and it's very nice to look at instead of the usual ugly metal crates. It also has a removable pan for washing. I was worried about the puppy chewing on it, but she hasn't so far and it's been about a month."
3,Defective,"We were very excited to get this crate and have it for our labrador. We pulled it out of the box and started to assemble it only to discover that the holes where screws go through had the wicker wrapped through them! We would have had to cut the wicker and somehow glue it to keep it from unraveling in order to access the holes. Back to the store it goes.UPDATE: We decided to use wire on the defective holes to put the crate together rather than pay to ship it back and honestly, it is a really nice crate. It's pretty, sturdy and our lab like's it much more than the wood one (she was chewing it badly but after 5 nights in this one she hasn't touched it, I think she likes the open front better). The latch does seem a little weak but it's holding up so far. All in all, it looks nice, my dog likes it, so it got upped 2 stars."
2,Chopin meets some guy with a Casio,"What we have here is basically a live recording of a series of piano works with intrusive treatments meant to accompany a video installation. Unlike his collaborations with Eno (whose treatments compliment Budd's piano), Bernocchi's polyrhythms, filters, and echo treatments get in the way of the music. Not having seen the video, I can't judge wether the imagery works with the collaboration. The sound mix also isn't up to par, as there is a lot of ambient noise from the audience in the first track. But judged on the merits of the performance, I can only recommend this to Budd fanatics. It's like watching a great movie with someone banging pans and dishes in the kitchen to the sound of a beatbox."
5,A clear and thought provoking contribution.,"Cliff Havener has written quite a book! It is under two hundred pages with really nice print; contains illustrations both graphic and literal and REALLY speaks to us about MEANING. Purpose, essence, understanding, reason and other conceptual frames serve us in our quest for meaning. Mr. Havener takes us on a nice and very interesting and meaningful journey towards an integrated and systemic way of looking at things. Through some factual and therefore actual organizational experiences with which we can readily identify, we clearly see how our thinking gets us into cycles that create fodder for coming up with solutions that are the very seeds and root of the problems we seek to resolve. I sincerely recommend a wonderful read through this book. And, I promise you a real good grok of our memes!"
4,Impressive,"I'll admit, I was intrigued by the hard luck story of Evie Sands so I bought the CD. I wasn't disapointed. It's every bit as good as I'd heard. Better than Bonnie Raitt. Every song is a winner."
1,Not worth resurrecting....,"Removed from the bland movie it supports, this ""score"" has little to recommend it. You would do well to give this one a miss and go for the original, far superior score by John Carpenter...."
1,Very disappointed,"Really wanted this mouse to work since it looks great next to my new Sony laptop. After a couple of months of routinely losing the bluetooth connection I gave up and ordered a logitech mouse today. Every time I lose the connection, i have to turn my wi-fi switch off/on...remove the mouse from the bluetooth connection...and then add it back on. Sometimes I have to complete these steps multiple times. Hope you have better luck...I just gave up. And it sucks up batteries at a pretty goood pace."
2,"Not as good as it shoulda, coulda been...","I know that it takes talent to make music, and I hate to criticize any musicians because I certainly couldn't do it, but this CD was just not that good. There are some cool beats, but they're pretty forgettable. Lyrics in electronic music aren't always deep or anything, but in some cases, I think she actually was trying to make a ""real song"", so it was kind of sad. Her vocals are Madonna-esque, without the smooth production. Maybe she just didn't quite live up to the hype. I'm beginning to think that most female djs ""make it"" just because of the novelty of female djs. There was nothing to HATE, but there certainly wasn't anything to love, either."
5,Start of a Revolution?,"I bought this CD not knowing anything about Immortal Technique, except for what I read in a magazine. I was in a record shop and saw someone else with the cd on the counter and it reminded me of what I had read. I purchased the album on a whim and am 300% satisfied with it. I might be partial because I agree whole heartedly with most of his politics. It is good to know there are people that know what is going on. Now its time to spread the word and start the revolution This is a great medium [Hip Hop] to do it through. Let us take control from the eye on the back of the dollar bill, heh."
5,Hip hop album of the century,"I've become come very skeptical of hip hop in recent years, now that we are in the bling bling era. It's nice to see intellect permeate through the music in ways that many artists fail, but Immortal Technique is able to deliver a solid album with exceptional historic accuracy, and a raw edge that sounds like a rusty saw grating across a chain link fence. You can hear his passion for change and love of hip hop all throughout the album. Bangin' beats, sick lyrics, and brilliant concepts. Who can ask for anything more? Word. I've seen him perform, and he's just as passionate live. Go get Revolutionary Vol. 1 as well, it's just as bangin. Peace to all. One."
1,unhappy,"I was not pleased at all with my purchase. The idea was suppose to be in excellent condition, but the last page was riped out."
4,A Cheerful Look into the World of Shapes,"This bright, colorful book with whimsical illustrations is fun to look at. The big, bold words are easy for children to read, and the rhyming text is simple. It encourages children to look for the shapes hidden within each picture. While it has no real story line, it is valuable as a tool for learning shapes and colors. It may be a bit too simplistic for some, if they are of reading age. It might be more appropriate as a board book, rather than a hardcover."
3,London Double Bass Sound,"This CD is certainly an interesting concept, however musically speaking it doesn't quite hit the mark that it intended. Fans of Gary Karr should certainly consider buying this CD because his performances are inspiring and the ensemble does a nice job of accompanying, however the selection of repetoire does not always help the bassists' fight for serious recognition. ""The Elephant"" sounds grotesque enough with only one bass playing it, but here there are four basses on the solo line. The jazz tunes are nice, but lack a certain excitement and the inclusion of the Spice Girls' ""Wannabe"", as humorous as it may have intended to be, may set the double bass back a few steps in the eyes of the general, non bass playing public."
2,"A very small book, with smaller pictures.","Many or the pictures are only 1-1/2"" x 3-1/4"".The largest are about 2-1/2"" x 3-1/4""."
3,"OK, But I Prefer Others","OK hard chick rock similar in tone and style to Fetchin Bones or Mary's Danish. I didn't really like it but it is fine for the genre, stand out is `World Clash'."
1,waste of money,"I bought this tool and when i got it i notice it was cheaply made. The flutes were uneven, did not have the proper bevels to make cuts, instead it would would leave burrs. The tool was not heat treated to prevent dulling. This tool is useless. I threw it away in the trash and i going to buy a nice countersink bit and make a handle. I would NOT recommend this tool!!! The only reason I bought this tool is because my friend has one and it works great, he bought his countersink tool over 7 years ago... I don't know what happen to the workmanship but it has gone down hill since then."
2,big let down,"this cd is not even half as good as 'seven years bad luck'. the song medicine is pretty catchy, but 'seven years' is the album you're looking for."
1,Not worth the price,Big fan. Kids all excited to hear the story. It was a weak little effort trying to make more money selling another book. Story unimaginative and it was not a real effort. For paying off such a big component of the main books (and answering my daughter's desire) I bought it. A real waste. They read every other one 20-30 times -they have yet to open this a second time.
4,"Corporate Finance Review by Jameson L. Thottam (formerly with Morgan Stan, IndyMac, and Homestore)","A good solid book for those seeking a finance background,My name is Jameson Thottam and as an individual steeped heavily in finance (graduated from UC Berkeley and attending Wharton's MBA and focused on financial services such as such as The Loan Page, IndyMac Bank, Homestore), I would give a strong recommendation on this book to those in finance. There are other books however, that provide more details on mathematical financial programing and simulation software (i.e., Linear programming, Monte Carlo Simulations, CRYSTAL BALL / SEC II / @RISK software packages). Additionally, if you like market insider trading (i.e., technical analysis)...you can do much better. Other than that, the book is a good book.Hope you enjoy,Jameson Luke Thottam(Job History: Battery Ventures/The Loan Page, IndyMac Bank, Homestore, Morgan Stanley Investment Banking, LEK Management Consulting)Houston, Tx"
2,Zel,"Zel, is all about a girl who lives on an alm in Switzerland with her mother. One day when her mother finds out that she has fallen in love, she locks her up in a tower and says that she must stay there,because someone is trying to kill her. Zel escapes,when Konrad finally finds her after searching for years. When they do finally find each other, they live on together until they die. I didn't really enjoy this book and thought that it was very graphic, and Zel almost went crazy in the tower! But I wouldn't really reccomend this book to anyoneand wouldn't waist my money on it!"
3,Not enough meat.,"This book was easy enough to read and an absolutely great idea. I even thoroughly enjoyed the author's take on the matter. Where it left me wanting was in its own sparseness. If you're going to do it, why not do it all the way? Give us more. But, Mrs. Readwell, you may ask, isn't the book's simplicity due to it being written for a young audience. Peut-tre. It is, of course, always vastly better to overestimate one's audience than to under. [Mrs. Readwell's Recommendation: Marginally entertaining but ultimately unfulfilling.]"
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"I think Donna Jo Napoli is an awful writer. I think the thing that I despise the most is that she uses so many simple sentences. This might be alright is she was comepletely consistent with it, but since she occasionally throws in a compound sentence you realize that her pupose is not to write the whole thing in simple sentences, but that that is all the ability she has to write.Overall, the plot is quite good, but the poor quatlity of writing reuins it for me and I simply cannot believe anyone could actually like this book. I implore anyone considering reading and/or buying this book to give up their consideration and turn their book reading/buying consideration to much better prospects. There is a myriad of fantastic books out there and Zel certainly is not one of them."
3,an interesting read.....yet not as good as Sirena,"I recomend this book (very weakly) Yet it was interesting and bearable, but try reading Sirena, also by Donna Jo Napoli. Sirena is much more beautifuly written, and it has a lot of mythological creatures in it which makes it stand out. Zel was just too hard to get into, and quite frightening to think about at some points. But other than that this book was Okay. I also recomend Lirael and Harry Potter, they are in the same family, (well almost)"
5,Great Story,"I really liked this book. It is a great rendition of the original Rupunzel story. If you love fairy tales, you should read it. It is great, and the ending is so happy!!!"
3,Disapionting,"After reading so many takes on different fairy tales, this one was disapionting. This book is probably ment for early teens and I do not believe anyone older than 14 would enjoy it. I found that this book did not go into much depth and since this is my favorite story I guess I could be slightly prejudice. Even though very well written, there was not enough creativity and I was looking for more."
4,organizer,"this is a decent gift. i recently purchased it for our intern that graduated from college. it's nothing fancy, backpack canvas material, zips around. does the job i guess. inexpensive and thoughtful"
3,Ordinary gel eye cream,"I have used loreal eye cream before but it's a little thick and burn if it's near the eye. I then switch to Clinique All About Eye, which goes on velvety and moisturizes, but is too greasy for me except in dead of winter. I'm combo skin, 20s, in New England.I then tried this. It have a gel/cream consistency that glides on very easy, and sinks into the skin pretty fast so you can feel it moisturizes. If you rub your eye cream in (*gasp*) instead of dabbing like me, the eye cream can get a bit warm and uncomfortable right as it dries. Yes it moisturizes and helps dehydration lines. I don't have dark circles but do have puffy eye bags and wrinkle/crease under my eye bad, and there were no change/improvement when I switched from All About Eyes to Icelandic Relief. It's a nice hydrating eye cream for combo/oily skin, but not effective as antiaging measures or for puffy eye bags."
4,Size matters,"you might want to be careful with the size of your strap button or width of the strap before buying this but other than that... i bought this cuz i couldnt be bothered to screw out parts of my guitar for a strap lock, its simple and works great."
4,Lovely instrumentals with a Celtic touch,"The more familiar tunes (""Red Red Rose,"" etc.) sound great in their instrumental versions, as do the lesser-known pieces. Very nice, mellow record to play and relax to."
5,"Good, Except for the Title","Heifetz was the greatest violinist of the twentieth century; this is almost indisputable. No reason to doubt that the documentary may be extremely interesting. To call Heifetz a ""fiddler"", is derogatory (and I would say stupid, because demeaning him was the least of the producers' intentions). To associate him with God is an impiety; Heifetz' personality was as ungodly as it can be."
4,Christian book,Apparently a good book. Was bought from the Amazon marketplace for my son. They labeled it 'contraband' and now he will be sending it to me to read. I am sure it is ok if it has been rejected by a prison. LOLadditional information: I did end up with the book and found it very interesting and compelling. Christianity is nothing if not pragmatic and if it is not pragmatic then it would be nothing. Written in the vein of St. Paul and his nevertheless phrase this book gets to the core of the matter of Christian living and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
3,"Novel si, history no!","As a pure fiction Tim Wendel's widely-discussed novel is at least a passing success. But readers should be fully aware of the conceit on which it is built. Fidel Castro was never a serious major league pitching prospect, not an athlete scouted by the major leagues. That much is propoganda pure and simple. For the historical detail check out the recent histories on Cuban baseball, such as those by Gonzalez Echevarria and Rucker and Bjarkman. As for Wendel, a passingly good read."
2,Its an experience,"As a member of the Soka Gakkai, I am well acquainted with members sharing their experiences with the practice and their lives. However Michael Lisagor's Romancing the Buddha is a bit over the top. To dedicate 140 pages to his life is only for his most strident fans.If you are interested in Buddhism and remaking/changing/aligning your life, a better read would be The Buddha in Your Mirror: Practical Buddhism and the Search for Self by Woody Hochswender."
1,A disappointing tool roll,"This looked like it would be a good tool roll, but overall it was disappointing. The ""fabric"" is some sort of plastic that doesn't hold tools particularly well. The tool pockets are pretty shallow (about 3 1/2""). The straps have plastic clips that are hard to draw up tightly. The combination of these factors allows tools to easily fall out of the end of the tool roll. Rather than lose tools, I ""lost"" the tool roll."
2,Not worth the money..,I purchased these tool wraps as a way to seperate my tools into job specific tool bags. These wraps were made of flimsy thin material and would not withstand any kind of regular usage let alone the type of environment that I work in (elevator mechanic). Also the straps were thin and the buckles were small plastic feed through type. Not convienent to work with on a regular basis and prone to fraying after regular use making them useless.These bags would have been better if they were made of a more substantial material and if they had snap-in clasps for ease of use and access. Spend a few more dollars and get the ones that will last and have all of the features that you want.
5,Spiritual Testament,"This deluxe edition of what renowned Fellini specialist Tullio Kezich describes as the Maestro's ""spiritual testament"" (in his superb foreword to the book) is bona fide Fellini-esque. Hilarious anecdotes are squeezed in beside a number of very moving meditations on old age, sex, LSD, unemployment, Trivial Pursuit, God, Dante, death and the Hereafter. The newly restored black-and-white photos capturing the Italian director's surreal world are well-served by an excellent English translation. The final entry in the lexicon is a fairy tale titled ""Zio Lupo"" or ""Uncle Wolf"" and it pretty much defines Fellini's insatiability. Highly recommended."
5,American Folk Tradition At It's Finest,"Anne Hills has brought joy to fellow musicians, friends and the public for many years with album after album and performance after performance of music spun in the folk tradition. This early recording reveals her clear and nimble voice which has become richer over the years. The vocal harmonies are elegant in their simplicity and gentle flow. There's plenty of fun to be had with ""Last Day of Pompeii"" and its fantasies of what one ""wudda, cudda & shudda"" done if one had only known... And with that in mind, don't panic! You still have a chance to add this delightful album to your collection!"
3,cracks easily in shipping,Not enough bubble wrap left about a dozen broken. They are very thin and the lack of sufficient packing material has left me with many cracked cases.
1,"not a good value, Plugs up awfully easily","This dust collector was entirely unsatisfactory and has been replaced. It now sits all alone outside and is not being used and nobody interested in buying it used.1. Very hard to clean the filter.2. Very fine dust like from a drum or wide belt sander plugs it up almost instantly.3. lid is heavy and inconvenient and needs a very tall can to keep from sucking stuff from the trash can into the filter.4. Not sure I ever got even near 650 cfm. Doesn't even work on one machine very well.5. Usual crappy tech support from Jet, Performax, Delta ETC. You know when they all are under one corporation, tech support will go down the tubes.5. Reccomendation: buy something more powerful like a cyclone type DC."
5,Works awesome.,"Used it to fix my ""slow turn"" xbox 360 controller. Works great, turns really smooth. I had to shave off quite a bit of plastic and it did the job well."
1,what was I thinking?,These are the worst things you can ever imagine. I was hoping for something that LOOKED like boxing gloves for a scenic effect. These are awful. I can't imagine a kid finding any enjoyment in these unless you count jumping on them till they burst
3,swamp cooler,This cooler works fine for a small area only. A bit noisy while running on high. For dry heat only.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased this product to cool of our small bedroom. Like others have said, its not even a good fan. Its noisy and inconsistent and very cheaply made. I sent it back and Amazon was great! After purchasing, I read more reviews and realized I had made a bad investment. I tried it for myself and everything other people wrote was correct!"
2,"NO SPEED, NOT COld","This product doesn't have an SPEED, you have to keep the product closed to your face to receive a little of air. You put ice and cold water and the air still coming hot. The company that sell it was GREAT SERVICE. PRODUCT NOT GOOD"
5,time,Good educational book like that pages can be reproduced. It has been great for kids of all ages. Would recommend to all parents or people working with young children.
1,wrong item,i was sent the wrong logitech webcam. I had specified a mac compatible Notebook Pro version and I got the Windows one. I sent it back
1,Cheap,My belt ripped...my waist is a 30 and I purchased a size 33 and it still ripped...I actually want a refund.
3,Outdated,"I should have known better, but this book is fairly outdated, being written more that 10 years ago.You should stick to more popular books on TeX/LaTeX such as the 'Companion' series, Guide to Latex, et alli."
5,shining star,I use this bulb on my motorcycle and it changes the way I am able to drive both in the daylight and at night. daylight hours I am more visible and ride safer. At night I can see much better and have more confidence as I ride.
5,I (think) I finally understand...,"The age of the book is what gives it a huge advantage to today's typical QT and QM textbook. Instead of presenting the concepts in the ""status quo"" of physics (usually just a ridiculously brief intro to why QT started, and then presenting Operators as things almost perfectly synonymous to classical concepts and continuing from there), this book really goes through the history of where all the math came from. Bohm is very careful about teaching you what parts of the math are just convenience tricks (like Operators) versus real necessities to QM. And also what parts are just based on just experiments. Unlike today, in the 1950's, QT and QM were still suspect theories, so students were taught of the known and possible holes (no pun intended :) in the theory. Bohm points these out throughout the whole book."
4,Malaya Guerrilla Ops,"Malaya Guerrilla Ops""Silent Army"" by Chin Kee Onn is a story told by a Chinese Malayan teacher, is realistically detailed and offers many practical ideas for future guerrillas. The Japanese invasion of Malaya and subsequent guerrilla formations and activities are vividly described. The book offers insight into the functions of communist guerrilla bands and their preparation for post-World War II activities."
3,A good ska album,"I have to say that this is a decent album. The original Keasbey night was the first ska album I listened to. Hell, it was the CD that got me into ska in the first place. When I first saw SM in concert, I fell in love with them, and when rumor was that they were remaking KN, I was ECSTATIC. However, despite already being able to sing along with this CD, I was looking forward to having more changed than there was. There are some subtle lyrical differences, and you really have to listen for them. And unless you perfectly know C22's version, they're kinda hard to pick out. There were also some solo differences. Also, on many songs, Tom seems like he doesn't have as much energy put into this album, like he's just singing because everyone expects him to. He has WAY more energy on the original. As much as I love streelight, I was hoping for SOMETHING else...maybe a combo Point/Keasby/Counterpoint, like what they do in concert. Good album, slightly dissapointing."
5,Keasbey Nights with a Streetlight Spin,"Don't dismiss the album just because its a re-release of 'Keasbey.'Don't even dismiss it after one, two, or three listens--you have to listen to it several times to fully appreciate the amount of work that the band put into it.Even without listening closely, you can tell that the recording quality is much better.After a closer listen, you can tell that new instruments were incorporated excellently and presicely. There are even one or two songs that have additional lyrics.Streetlight didn't want to damage the legacy of Catch 22's 'Keasbey' so they did not do anything radical or crazy when they re-did it. Consequently, it sounds great.Even if you don't like the idea of a re-made album, buy this just to have it in your ska collection.My favorite song on the album is 'Sick and Sad'--they did a great job redoing this one."
5,Same stuff?,"The original Keasbey was the one CD I listened the most in high school. I saw Catch 22 play when I was a freshmen in college and I was sad. I hated their new style. Then I found out about Streetlight and the drama between the two bands and it's interesting to see how that played out with this album.It does lack some of the grit and grain from the original but in all honestly, this is how the album is supposed to sound. There are some new lyrics in a couple of the songs that make them more complete and even the solos are better; especially the one on This One Goes Out to... The horn arrangement gives it a fuller sound that the original simply lacks. I can't wait to hear these songs preformed live this summer when I see them with the incredibly awesome Aquabats!"
3,"They Changed It, Now It Sucks.","On the upside, this is a way way more technically proficient revisting of the 1997 original. On the downside, it's kind of like seeing the reworked ""Star Wars"" movies - it's still Keasbey Nights, but now they added in a bunch of new stuff and changed it around and it's not the same.it's prettier, yes. it's fuller and sounds better and everyone's a better musician (as they'd better well be, given that we're 10 years out). that being said, it's familiar ground that's been trod a million times before, and do we really need to photoshop the sistine chapel?So yes, it sounds better than the original. On the other hand, the original was perfectly fine. It's neat to hear the revisited version, but it's kind of something that didn't need improving on in the first place."
2,Disappointing.,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed. First of all, it seems like Tomas Kalnoky just wanted to make this album to spite Catch 22.Even though I knew this album was going to be a remake of Keasbey Nights, I thought it would at least sound something like Everything Goes Numb, which is one of my favorite albums.Basically, the main addition is a stronger but bland and uninteresting horn line for most of the songs.The music completely lacks any personality, and it just isn't fun to listen to.Tomas Kalnoky needs to realize that his music is for FANS to listen to, not for his personal enjoyment. If he wanted to ""get it right"" he could have done it on his own time. I just wish Streetlight Manifesto would have come out with music that has the complexity and feeling of EWN."
1,Deceptive Title,"This is not the Elmer Clark's Journal and Letters of Frances Asbury. Rather, this is one year of his journal (1771). His letters and journal are three volumes and go from 1771 to 1816. DO NOT BUY THIS falsely labeled book. On the inside cover under the standard bibliographical information for the correct book, it says ""specimen pages from the standard annotated edition."" This book was created to steal money via deception."
3,Pick Holder,I does the job that I wanted it for. Just to keep picks in my guitar case. It's okay but it could be better.
1,Flimsy design results in misaligned holes,"Regardless of how precisely you mark your intended hole location, line up the jig and crank it down, this jig does not hold the bit true. It allows the bit to move as well as drill at a slight angle. The result is that the wood you are joining does not line up and needs substantially more sanding than should be necessary with doweling. The revolving turret seems to be the weakest link in this product with the turret slide not far behind. I'm returning this product and will spend a little more money on a self-centering jig."
1,You get what you pay for,"If you need smooth joined surfaces this is not your tool. The clamp ends as well as the clamping screw are plastic, allowing the entire tool to shift with even a slight amount of pressure. Only one guide arm has a set screw, this also affects the tool's stability. The graduated guide bars are nearly impossible to read and not nearly exact enough for this type of work. Spent several frustrating hours with this tool and several more sanding the the joints it created. Again, you get what you pay for."
4,Hooray for the Yips!,"Looking for that special something to revive your hope in rock and roll? This album is an unexpected treasure in a world that has been nothing less than soulless, heartless,and utterly artless since Kurdt's sad demise. Long Live Rock! With nothing more than drums, guitar, and vocals, The Yips prove that you needn't be a big outfit to sound snappy. Lyrical references range from ""Pele's peripheral vision"" to ""a little piece of plastic"" and sound personal and vast at the same time. If you find yourself grasping at hollow straws when cruising for music these days, stop the madness and suck up this colorful pixie stick."
2,Cheap but very difficult to make it work,"Well, is very cheap... But, and its a big but..First of all, I am and experience user and it took me a lot of work and research to make it work on Ubuntu (9.10 karmic). But i finally made it =).If you are a Windows user: The drivers may work, if the dont, just get to the ""Windows Update"" and you'll find the driver.The software that should handle the Video Card, the config, channels, etc, doesnt work on Windows 7. And I havent found another software to use it on Win 7...Sooo, from 1 to 10, my score is: ..... 3"
1,Just dosen't work,"Title says it all, fiddled with it for 3 days and never got it up and running. No tech support so you are on your own. And I built the system I was installing it on from parts so I have some small grasp of what I was doing."
4,Great,"Easy install TV/capture card. Worked perfectly first tine out. I only wanted the capture feature, but now I can watch TV while my wife thinks I'm working."
3,Falling apart.,"We use a variety of tool bags and cases in our jobs and we were hoping this would solve a problem of storage and mobility not found with regular bags. Unfortunately the smaller ""pony"" bag is not doing it's part in holding up to regular, everyday usage. The top seem is pulling away from the main carcase allowing tools to scatter about in the vehicles and continues to open up wider with everyday of use. While the material is sound and the seem sewing is not cut the problem must be in the engineering or design. Not very satisfying for the cost."
4,awww,"Daveigh may be older, but her voice sounds much better for Lilo than Dakota. I mean, doesn't Daveigh still do the voice for Lilo on the TV show?"
2,Below what I expected,"Swizz's second album realise, quite anticipated by most of his fans after a three year wait it is about time. However, not as good as the first some of the tracks on this album are noteworthy. Shyne an excellent track, a nice beat. Also the rest I think are ok in which I mean mediocre. Lil Kim, Busta, Styles P. and Eve are a few notable rappers on this album. What I think on my final opinion, well it could be better. Swizz might wanna keep his rhymes in the closet for now. The first star I gave him he deserves, the second I did for the horrible effort."
2,Mastering Maya 3?,"If you're looking for a good Maya book for a beginner... Keep looking! This book is made for intermediate to semi advance level artists. Basically, this book is not a how to book. It's a ""hey look, that button can do this, but we won't tell you how we do it.""It's just a reference book. No wonder why they can produce Maya4 book so quickly.Don't get me wrong, it is a good reference book but that is all. Way too much hype."
4,Good Intermediate Vinyasa flow DVD,"I was looking for an intermediate vinyasa flow DVD and this is it! The 60 minute flow portion is just that, you are constantly moving and work up a sweat. The music in the background that some people have complained about I did not find annoying or out of the norm at all. In fact it's almost so soft at times I didn't even realize there was music playing. Yes the backdrop is just a painted wall but I was hardly looking at the screen during the practice cause she had me moving so much. The poses comfortably go from one to the other with little to no awkward stop/pauses/weird transitions.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does lack standing balance poses and floor work, but I suppose that is due to the 60 min length as opposed to a longer 90 min class.Great DVD for intermediate vinyasa, would definitely recommend."
5,Even I Can Dare to Write Poetry!!,This book helped me a lot with feeling more confident about writing my own poetry and teaching poetry to my ESOL students. If only more books could be so friendly and clear. A terrific achievement.
2,Dissappointed!,"It is not steady for any work. I returned it the next day where I bought it from. You need to have a drill with 1/2"" chuck but you can use only the drill bit upto 3/8"". If you have a drill driver that accepts upto 3/8"" bit you need to buy an adapter. If you want to use 1/2"" drill bit you need to buy optional adapter again. This is ridiculous. The base is not steady enough for most work. It isn't built that bad. It looks nice but what is the use?"
2,"Fair at best, only moderately useful","I wasn't trying to substitute this for a drill press when I bought it, but I still found that it only works moderately well. I use it with an 18v Milwalkee cordless and this thing puts just enough friction on the movement to where it feels like I am using a 9v drill instead (it saps a lot of torque).Also, the base creeps across the work surface whenever you try to drill a hole at an angle for more than just a pilot-depth hole.I bought this item for a specific project and ultimately I ended up using either a cheap plastic doweling jig or no jig at all about 90% of the time. This thing was just too cumbersome and imprecise to really be worth the effort."
1,Buy Craftsman Instead,"I bought both, but will be returning the General. The Craftsman equivalent, #967173, is built better. Unlike what a previous reviewer says, this particular Craftsman unit does not require you to remove the chuck from your drill.The bushing runout is similar on both units, with the Craftsman probably a little tighter - at least comparing the units I have. The Craftsman is also made of cast aluminum with much thicker and heavier guide bars. There is also a spring return that should help press the unit flat against your work for added stability. There is a handle and more surface area on the base for holding the unit against your work and applying clamps. The General is made of injection molded plastic, and lacks all of the above features.Plus, I bought my Craftsman for the regular store price of about 27 bucks.Pretty no-brainer on this one."
1,Not what is used to be?,"I just saw a new one. I have a 30-year-old General No. 36. It was made in the USA, had two round knobs to hold the pivoting arms to the base, and came with two threaded ground-to-a-point pins that went through the base to help hold it in place on rough stock, or which could be reversed to screw into the base from the underside to center the bit on narrow stock. There is absolutely NO runout on the spindle, which fits into precision bushings. I had upgraded the chuck to an LFA to match a professional chuck on the AC-powered drill I usually use with this tool.It sounds like the current production is yet another made-in-China cheapened and downgraded version of what was once a useful tool. [sigh]"
3,"Decent CD, but not exactly what I expected","There's no doubt that American Woman and Fly Away are definetly why I bought this CD in the first place. But others also are kind of nice, like thinking of you and some of the other slow ones. The first thing that turned me off, though, about this album was the funk and R&B that was in almost every track, minus the two big hits. My perception of Lenny's music through the media was that of an alternative rocker that somewhat copied Hendrix, while in reality he's got some of that but more funk and R&B type rock. Not to say that is bad, I just wasn't expecting it. Of course the other bad thing was Lenny's lyrics, that aren't neccessarily bad on some of them, but on a couple are absolutely horrid. ""Stone Cold Player"" had a great sound, but I was saddened to find that it had one line and one sound repeated OVER and OVER again.In conclusion, this album is actually pretty good, but don't be fooled by Lenny's radio tunes for the album ones."
5,Does 5 mean 5 stars???,"I guess in this case it does. So what if Lenny uses Sly and Rick as inspiration, this is an album that could become a classic. I pickied it up today and I was hooked. Lenny keep up the good work and see you at the Boston shows this week."
5,excellent,Kravitzfans will love this albym and it should be added to your collection of his songs. Will play it over and over again
4,Lenny's Latest - A Personal Triumph,This album is the prefect successor to many of Kravitz' earlier records. The music is tight and has a retro-funk flavor. All of the tracks range from good to very good. Hard to imagine that anyone who likes Lenny will be disappointed here.
4,Another classic from the last king of groovin funk.,"Well Lenny has done it again. His last cd, circus, was a decent album that drifted from rock to funk. Now Lenny has gotten ahold of a drum machine and uses it on about half of the tracks. That combined with his funk attitude makes an intersting record. The even numbered tracks seem to be the most jammin while the odd numbered tracks seem to be more on the ballad side, with some exceptions. Basically, this album sounds like a hip Curtis Mayfield record with the base turned up. Any fan of Lenny will love this and this is a good introduction album for those who haven't had the treat to own a Lenny album."
1,I think I will pass on this one!!!,"I'm not a huge fan of Lenny, but every time I here the song ""Fly Away"" I change the station. It's just so boring, sorry."
1,I want to fly away......yeah,"Lenny Kravitz: were you in Milli Vanilli? You are a joke. Your lyrics sound like they were written by a child trying to win a fourth grade writing contest. ""I want to get away...I want to fly away....yeah"". I mean, for god's sake, man. That stuff is DEEP! And, after my first listen to 'mama said' many years ago, back in college, to think I actually liked Lenny....my, oh my. Must've been the beer! Kravitz has shown absolutely no progression in his music whatsoever. In fact, every album sounds exactly the same. Another bit of evidence of the equation: freaky hair + MTV + record company induced style = Wildly successful 'artist'. Oh Lenny, you poor thing, I almost feel sorry for you, especially if you wrote those lyrics yourself."
5,Perfect 'man' gift!,"I bought this as a gift for the husband and he absolutely loves it, he even bought a new 5 gallon bucket just to keep it on. If your partner is anything like mine, he will be back and forth to his supplies interrupting his workflow when doing DIY or chores around the house. This completely solves that problem! He loads it up with everything he'll need for a specific job and off he goes, no more laying things down on the ground to get lost or damaged. The rest of the time he keeps it loaded with a few generic tools suitable for most jobs, he is a happy man!"
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this as a gift. For some reason (could it have been the picture of the product?) I thought I would receive it as it looked. I guess I thought the Bucket Boss came with its own bucket with the outside pockets. But it doesnt. You have to insert your own 5 gallon bucket. I was kind of disappointed..not what I expected. Maybe the description should read ""Bcket not included?"" LOL But then again, I dont buy tools all that often."
4,It Depends?,"I just got finished reading this book. To tell the truth some of the reading was slow, however there were times when I couldnt put the book down. The characters are likeable and the story line is good. It kind of depends on your reading preference. If you like good vs evil in a fantasy surounding you should love this book!"
3,"GREAT IDEA, NOT A GREAT FOLLOW-THROUGH","A friend of mine recommended these books to me and I thought i'd give them a try. Upon joining the Sci-Fi book club, I got them for a penny or whatever. Anyhoo..The idea is fascinating, twelve swords with special attributes. Unfortunately, I had a hard time throughout keeping some of the characters straight in my head and actually caring for them. At times i'd put the books down and read something else, and then come back to them. That's not to say it was bad, it just could've been better, in my mind, anyway. The potential was definately there. I'd say, they're good reading and recommend it if someone was going to give them or borrow them to you. Even check 'em out at the library, but, I wouldn't buy them, for full price, anyway. I'd say 2.5/3 stars outta 5. But hey..that's just my opinion."
3,A decent read mostly,"The first book of swords is the best.It was good and didn't wander too much,Saberhagen just tries to fit too much in and eventually runs the story to the ground.But I repeat Read the first three anyways,they do make for a good read."
4,dirty epic!,"set conatins all the hits from the beaucoup fish disc. Cant miss for hardcore, import-hungry underworld fans."
4,works well,"I have been using this for awhile to help with the white film that our dishes get in the dishwasher, and it definitely helps. The first shipment that I received from Amazon had the same problem that many other reviewers have complained about - the product was hard and had to be broken up before use. I was hesitant to buy this again, since it was so much trouble to use, but it is very difficult to find locally, so I finally reordered. My last order was much better; every box is free-flowing."
2,A Remarkable Medicine,"The original book dates back some 20 years, and it was concise, to the point and informative. This new edition has been bundled with Mr. Dreyfus' biography, which may be interesting to some readers but it is not relevant to those seeking his views on the medication being discussed (phenytoin). The pertinent chapter is buried within the larger work and has to be sought out.I would recommend searching for his original book, unless you are particularly interested in Mr. Dreyfus' bio."
2,"Been there, done that.","After reading about 130 pages I began to feel like I had already read this. It reminds me a lot of The Corrections, though not as depressing or interesting...or good. The parents--the children and their individual perspectives and lives and then a lesbian affair. It's all been done before in The Corrections (and various other novels, come to think of it). It's boring, really. I didn't care for any of the characters, and even though I'm nearly finished with the book I still feel that they are two-dimensional. The Thea and Anne affair was so predictable--a sure sign of a mediocre book. I am only bothering because I have book group next Tuesday. I wouldn't bother if you really enjoy a well constructed novel."
3,"Colorful, but stretched too thin?","This was a colorful, light read that I enjoyed, but unfortunately it made no impact on me as great novels usually do. Wolfe makes the book worth reading in all her detailed descriptions of Rome, the art her character encounters, and the profession of art restoration. Beyond that, I was slightly disappointed that the plot was somewhat weak and anticlimactic. I wish that the author would have expanded upon insights into the main character's emotions and history. Maybe if the book was longer the story could have been stronger. Some sub-plots and references are mentioned quickly and then left untouched, leaving me frustrated at the end of the story. Having read the book in one day and being a teenager, I must admit that the reading level seems below me even though there are some very adult subjects in it. Overall, I appreciated the novel but hope that in the future, Wolfe's writing style matches the content she chooses to include."
5,Works great as a cleaning apron,"Although made to be a tool belt, this sturdy, comfortable apron works great as a cleaning apron. Plenty of loops to hold bottles of cleaning agents, pockets of various sizes to hold scrapers, paper towels, bits of trash, brushes, etc. And, of course, being a leather tool belt, it's butch enough for a guy to wear around the house while cleaning. ;)I bought this after reading ""Speed Cleaning"", which I would highly recommend."
3,tool belt / apron,I like the pockets but I may wind up tying the apron to my waist...I don't like the plastic belt buckle. I would have liked to have a tougher steel or aluminum belt buckle.
5,The History Of Hula,Kumu Hula: Keepers of a Culture is a documentary about the complete history of this well-renowned Hawai'ian dance. The interviews with respected hula teachers are insightful and gives an eye-opening view of the Hawai'ian people performing many hulas. This DVD is perfect for school research and for children who want to learn about hula dancing.
3,hat shape,"I bought this hat a few months ago to wear while working in the yard. It's a nice looking hat from afar. However my problem is with the bendable hat brim. I have to take a few minutes each time i intend to wear it to reshape the brim. Just taking it off your head changes the shape and you have to fix it over and over. It is delivered all bunched up ( or at least mine was..) and the brim has never looked flat and even since..no matter how long i spend shaping it. Which, is not something i wanted to have to do with a sun hat. A little too much work involved with this pretty little hat. Too bad....it's lovely otherwise."
5,The WPA Guide to 1930's New Mexico,"I recently ran across the WPA Guides and they are truly remarkable, not only about the state but about the time."
4,A Delightful Ride,How delightful of Mr. Baldacci to depart from his usual style to write this engaging tale! I thoroughly enjoyed my trip! Bought a couple books for Christmas stocking stuffers. It reads like an old fashioned romance black and white movie with a little intrigue. Something light that Alfred Hitchcock would have done. The reminiscing of older train rides now just memories to our older family members was interesting to read about and the book left me wanting to believe in the magic of trains and Christmas.We need to read more of these from Mr. Baldacci's pen. Nice to read from a man's perspective.
1,wated time and money,This book isn't worthy of your time or money. Mindless pap would be a good description of this drivel. A total bore of a book that would have been better left unwritten and unread.
3,ANOTHER OKAY CHRISTMAS BOOK,"AN OKAY CHRISTMAS BOOK. AN EASY, QUICK READ.THE WHOLE PART ABOUT THE AVALANCHE----UUUHHH???---WELL--THAT WAS A BIT MUCH. BUT ALL-IN-ALL, IT WAS OKAY"
4,All Aboard the Polar Express for Adults,"It didn't take me long to purchase The Christmas Train at an airport bookstore of all places during my end of the year travels. I purchased it because I thought maybe it might be just what Dr. Baldacci prescribes for a bad case of the holiday-rush-arounds. I was right.Baldacci knows that train travel appeals to all of us--if we had the time. He recognizes that weary travelers fantasize about relaxed travel during the holiday season;and he fashions a story that weaves the thoughts of going home for the holidays with an adventure.When your busy schedule permits, pick up a copy of ""The Christmas Train"" and find yourself a little nook and cranny to read it in. You will enjoy the holiday a little more."
3,The ending makes it worth it,"Baldacci seems to fall in love his own research, by citing statistics and facts, which detracts from the story and makes it stilted. But all-in-all, the double surprise at the end makes it worth it. This would make a fun movie, with an Indiana Jones-type lead man."
3,The Christmas Train~,"Not having read a Baldacci book before, I had no prior expectations when reading The Christmas Train. It looked like a fun holiday read. When I first started reading it, the writing did seem sort of elementary, but once I allowed myself to get into the story more, the pages flew by fast & I found it to be an entertaining read. Baldacci does paint a cozy setting aboard a train, as people are headed towards their Christmas destinations. The Christmas Train isn't deep, but it is an entertaining and fast read. The story is a combo of a love story/a bit of a mystery/and a history of the train system. If you take it for what it is, a purely fun & entertaining light read you may end up enjoying it. It was a perfect read for the hoidays."
4,Good Christmas book,"I really enjoyed this Christmas story. The plot surprised me several times, and the characters were interesting. This was a good book, and kept my interest to the finish."
4,the Christmas Train,I enjoyed this book as it was just a little different and a bit of fun. worth a read nice and quick
4,Good Tool for its Intended Use,While it will not replace my portable bandsaw - or my 9 inch Evolution Metal-Cutting saw - it is a great lightweight alternative that finds use where its 6 pound weight and compact size make it a better alternative to the 33 pound Evolution saw. Cuts through mild steel with ease.
3,Well Build Tool!,"We have an aluminum patio cover business and we use a lot of battery powered tools. In the past we have been using Milwaukee tools but have recently switched to Makita tools and found they have some great qualities but in some cases we found that they are not always the best tool for the job. Milwaukee has more power and the battery operating time seems to last longer but they are a little bit heavier and awkward, where as the Makita is lighter and nice to work with but not quiet the power or battery operating time. Our favorite tool with Makita has been their battery drills, we really like them over the Milwaukee but we are still testing out other tools to find the best battery circular saw. All in all they make some very good quality products.cw"
4,i'm a skeptic,"i have to admit, i'm a skeptic. i didn't feel like running wires, so i got one of these. i'm computer savvy, but i expected an annoying installation.the installation literally took 30 seconds. it was done so fast i didn't realize i had set it up. very cool. kudos to microsoft on this one.i have a d-link b router and i see no lag hosting games on xbox live. very cool product. would highly recommend!!"
1,Horrible Compatibility Problems,"I just received my adapter in the mail today, and will be sending it back tomorrow. It turns out, the adapter is not compatible with ANY ROUTERS made by NetGear. In fact, Microsoft reccomends that you ONLY use a LinkSys or Microsoft router. Since I don't have the money to throw away my old router and buy a new one, this product is totally useless to me, and probably will be to you unless you have a LinkSys or Microsoft router."
5,"It works, but security is tricky","This is the only product I know of that works with the X-Box. It's overpriced, but it does work well. I am all for less clutter so the price was worth it for me.The only issue with this device is you cannot change the security channel. What I mean is that I like to have my 128bit key on channels 2,3 or 4 but you MUST use channel 1 for this to work with your router (and your router must also have its 128bit key on channel 1).Other than that, this is another fine hardware product from Microsoft."
1,Bad answer,"After reading the first three our four essays, I had to check the cover to see if I was reading the right book. The book contains essays on personal productivity and motivation which are all fine, but very little content in the book is related to the title or subtitle.The only question I have now is why did I buy this book?"
5,GRIM DIRGE DOOM,"this is one of the most vial vicious recording from the long island threesome. at times pulling sounds out from the bowels of hell so low you need to be sitting with bong in hand at volume 10. there is no doubt this is one of the best bands out of the doom scene in the past ten years. combining the heaviness of DARK THRONE with the slowness of WINTER to create something truly there own. a friend listened to this and said ""this is the music you hear on your way down to hell"" a true statement."
2,Doesn't live up to box,My son got this for his 2nd birthday and it looked great but...It doesn't do much and is very loud. I would not recomend it.
1,Throwing away cash,You might as well throw away your cash - it won't be long before you'll throw away this toy. Really. It's that bad. Loud. No bubbles. Stops working after a child splashes it even a few times.
1,Terrible toy,This toy is so loud!! My son tried to jump out of the bath tub. He was so scared. I had to return it. Terrible toy!
1,Don't waste your money,"My 2 year old son loves fish, bubbles and baths so I assumed he would love this toy. He is afraid of it because it is too loud and it barely makes any bubbles. Don't waste your money on it!"
1,You gotta be kidding!,"This thing is louder than our jacuzzi!! The few small bubbles it makes is a joke. It scared my 15 month old to tears, AND the suction cups did not keep it attached to the tub. It stopped working after it got submerged but did dry out to work again, like it matters, we won't be using it anymore."
4,Wolf Plush,I purchased this for my grandaughter over two years ago. It it very durable. Gone through many washings and cleanings without a problem.Well made and a good value.
3,Is this really a World Atlas?,"I just found out 2/3 content of this atlas is about the United States. And this is actually not what I wanted --- I have a very good US Atlas, but I just wanted a real ""world"" atlas.The US maps of this atlas are made pretty well --- you can find almost any small town on a map. But for countries outside US, I just feel dispointed, especially for big countries, like Russia and China, the ""resolution"" of the map is not so good as my expection."
4,Terry Forever,"When I read this book it was good, but I don't think Terry Goodkind could or will ever out do the first book, Wizards First Rule. If you have read anything science fiction, you will LOVE this book. Also in my opinion, yes Terrys' books can stand by themselves, read them all. I have read the first 5 books, 6 times each, except Wizards First Rule which was 11 times."
4,A very good read,"I don't know why i haven't as yet lost interest in this series. I mean it really is all the same to me. But i can't get enough of Richard and Kahlans struggle. Their is no part in the books where you are not either amazed, angered or dare i say it heart broken. But somehow it all works out. Maybe that is the main reason I am still interested. Something different for reality."
3,Soul of the Fire...Runt of the Litter,"Soul of the Fire is definately the weakest of the five books in the series. It did not advance the story or characters as far as its 500+ pages should have. Although well wordsmithed and vivid, this leg of the journey seemed a mere side trek. I became interested in the the secondary characters only to have their stories rendered fairly meaningless and the climax of the book wrapped hurriedly and neatly in the last 25 pages. The first 450 pages were 4 star material, the last 58 were 1-2 star cliff's notes. We needed about another 100 pages. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come. Mr. Goodkind is one of my favorites."
2,Too much wading through character development.,"Very disappointing effort from Mr. Goodkind. Based on the first four volumes, I expected the same intricate story lines and plot development, and received about 300 pages of the political intrigue in Anderith. Who cares? This sequel was only loosely tied into the plot of the series by the ever-present references to the Dominie Dirtch and how the Imperial Order would win if they gained control. All the other nonsense with Fitch and the Hakens seemed very irrelevant. Definitely not Mr. Goodkind's best effort."
2,Not up to Par,"Hello people, this is not the best book in the series...this book ranks fifth. I consider wizards first rule and stone two of my favorite all time books. However this one was not up to par. Anybody that disagrees go back and read the 1st. You can't say it enough.....""chicken monster""???????????? come on, really!"
3,A Difficult Read . . .,"I've truly enjoyed reading all of the Sword of Truth novels, BUT this one definitely tried my patience.Mr. Goodkind is adept at developing a history to show his readers why the characters act as they do. But this book concerns itself so much with explaining the behavior of the Anderith people, that I found myself wanting to just move on to the next book.However, if you plan to go on the the next book, you still need to read this one to understand why Richard loses heart in his fight.This is not a bad book, but be prepared to read on, even when the story isn't keeping your interest."
3,Please bring back the power in next volume,"The book was an unwanted child of the Sword of truth series. One likes it after birth but does not adore it and keeps comparing the other children. Let bygones be bygones and As much as I loved Terry's previous books, I would like to give him a chance to continue his reign as a top fantasy writer by proving himself and/or outdoing himself in the sixth book. Are you listening Terry? You are your own destiny, just like Richard. Let the sword speak the truth and win the battle of the millinium - Our hearts. Good Luck."
2,The silence before the storm,"I love the 'Sword of Truth' series. Up untill this book the series was getting better and better.""Soul Of the Fire"" though was rather disappointing. Too little events of real importance and too much attention is given to rather dull characters like Fitch. It took me more than the first half of the book to get suckered in by the story. The book itself may be worth 3 or maybe even 4 stars, but in comparison to its precedants it's just plain boring.HOWEVER, I would urge everyone to read this book, because it provides the setup for the sixth book of the series, 'Faith of the Fallen', which is, in my opinion, the very best book of the entire series."
2,Disappointing.,Where were was all my favorite characters? The series seems to be declining as I read each new book in the series. I had to work to finish this book and the only reason I didn't put it aside was because I am to stubborn to stop reading something I started. He spent a number of pages introducing new characters for us readers to relate to and then went nowhere with it. I felt like I wasted time trying to get to know these people. I'm giving the series a break and moving on to something better. The series has dried up for me.
4,While I was waiting . . .,"I am waiting like all the rest of us for SOF. I have read all Terry's books and twice over he is just a brilliant writer and I would read anything by him. I can't wait to get my copy of it. But I had to read something else to fill the time. I just finished Katya Reimann's book A TREMOR IN THE BITTER EARTH. Terry recommended it! The review is right there on the page. I stayed up all night reading this book. It is the second book in the series. Now I want to get the first. Terry is not only a good writer, he showed me this book. I read so much fantasy, it is hard to find something new and good. Way to go, Terry! (and hurry up with the next one!)"
3,STOP CRYING OVER RACHEL AND COMPANY,"I have not read the book yet, since it is not out in Holland yet. But I have read some of the above reviews and I am getting tired of all the people who want to hear more about gratch and rachel..They are still on the same world as Richard and will turn up again in time. But I do not think it is necessary that they are present all the time. They have a life off their own you know!Either in the woods (grath) or in westland (chase and rachel). The story(s) is mainly about Richard and Kahlan and about their feelings and emotions. That is what makes TG books different than those of for example R.Jordan. I hope TG writes 10 books! I only think that the next book should be about getting rid of Jagang."
2,Should have been shorter,"This book was not up to the very high standard of the first 4. The setting of Anderith (spelling? ) and the characters was very drawn out. I am starting to get a bit frustrated with the inability of the key players to communicate, and there are days to travel across the countryside, but none to talk.The basic plot is good, but I would like to see Richard growing into his role more. After all the padding in the middle, the climax was very swift.I hope Volume 6 come back up to his previous very high standard."
4,good,"not my favorite in the series, but i still liked it. zedd totally rules in this and the ending is a heartbreaker."
1,When you think Terry Goodkind has hit rock bottom....,"Somebody throws him a shovel. A really heavy-duty one. I always finish my series. Always. I read Wizard's First Rule and I thought it was pretty good, despite the blatant copying of Robert Jordan. The second book was mediocre, but I always excuse the second book in a series... after all, Star Wars was good, The Empire Strikes Back was not as good, but Return of the Jedi was fantastic.Terry, quit while you can still get a profit. I will never read another one of your books because they are so disgusting. Frankly, age-old ""commies-are-bad"" rhetoric died with the Cold War.Soul of the Fire was the most poorly written, pornographic, disgusting and idiotic piece of literature that I have ever read. A five-year old could write better. In the words of the Simpsons, I could puke in a fountain pen and mail it to the monkey house and get better writing.Hope this constructive criticism helps, Mr. G. ;)"
2,This book ends the series for me,"This series seems to have lost it's edge, almost as if TG forgot where he was in his own series. The characters are becoming more and inept as each book comes along. The most powerful wizard in the history of this world TG has built, is not able to light a fire.Khalan, his wife, argues every decision he makes for 10 pages, only to end up agreeing with him. This happens several times per book. His is the supposed King of the land, yet no one listens to his commands for the most part.I believe this series had the chance to be up there with Dragon Lance, The Belgariad, and The wheel of time. Yet, the books lag on after the 3rd. I find myself skimming chapters just to get past the retelling of the previous books. The characters never progress in their abilities.I will not continue this series."
3,A bit unsettling,This book took a turn for the worse if you ask me. Goodking has been very loyal to his characters up until now as well. Suddenly he decides to add new ones and then kills them off for the hell of it. I just wish he'd get back to his original story
2,Wait for the paperback edition,I was disappointed in this book. I was about two thirds of the way finished with it when I realized that absolutely nothing had happened. Being part of a good series makes the book worth reading. It is not worth buying the hardcover edition.
2,"Disjointed, slow, choppy","This book is a disappointment, several hundred pages are wasted as we wait for something significant to happen, the Hakens seemed a waste of time. It looks like Goodkind was trying to stretch to 508 pages. The slow plot and the confusion do not make for entertainment,, sorry Terry"
2,Unspectacular installation in an excellent series,"I was very disappointed by this novel. The first and second books were great, in fact some of the finest fantasy that I have read. The next two books were mediocre; and, to put it mildly, the current one is a disaster. It is incredibly boring!! The plot is lame and very linear, whatever happened to that good old ""ten different sub-plots running along in parallel"" formula? It worked so well in the beginning! I would not even recommend this novel to die-hard Richard fans because it is such a letdown =("
3,An okay read.,"This book was... needed. In the structure of story there are certain things that must always happen. For me, this book was a path I needed to go down to get from the 4th to the 6th (books). This book has good parts in it, but for me it was not a very enjoyable read. However, if you have read the previous four books and dislike this one... do not give up. Faith of the Fallen is really good and worth getting to. If you do read this book and greatly enjoy it - even better!"
2,Boring,"When I pick up a fantasy book, I really expect to read fantasy. This book had almost no magic or fantasy involved. If I wanted a political thiller, I would have picked up that type of book. In addition, it seemed that this book was completely independent of the first 4 and the 6th. I was extremely disappointed and regret the time I spent on it when I could have read something more suitable to the fantasy area."
3,The Magic was lost in this one - in more ways than one,"I've loved Terry's books from day one and was looking forward to this one for some time, unfortunately, he let us down. Unlike his other books which only took a few chapters to set up the rest of the adventure, it seemed like the first 350 pages of this one were for that purpose. The Goodkind imagery and detail was there but that was lost to facets we didn't care about, not the action and suspense we've come to enjoy. The last 100 pages or so were of course filled with plots changes and action, but it seemed as if he was in a rush to tidy up all the loose ends. Hoping the next book has the ""grip"" the first 4 did. Its worth reading, just to continue the journey, but don't look for Magic."
2,For the love of GOD!,"Alrighty..I love the way Goodkind writes, I love the first books in the series, but for the love of God, will he get back to writing about important parts of the storyline? The thing that made me the most upset about the book was that with 10 pages left I was still wondering what was going to happen and if everyone was going to die! COME ON! Its called ""Wrap it up"". He spent I don't know how many hundreds of pages talking about Fitch and Baeta and all the stupid Anders and less than 2 pages about actually getting rid of the chimes! 2 pages! GEEZ! I hate that I have to buy the next book to feel fullfilled when I know it will just tear me apart like this one did. GET WITH IT TERRY!"
2,So Boring,"Wow, first of all I hate politics, so when I read these books I am not expecting to read about stupid politics and yet about half of it is devoted to that and lemme tell you no one freakin cares about Fitch or Beata or Dalton or any of the Anderith people and their stupid political schemes. I wanted to kill myself reading those parts of the book. And this was the first book in the series where I could actually pull myself away from it easily and have thoughts of throwing it out the window without finishing it.My advice: read it if you want to know what is going on but skip the parts about politics and Fitch and Beata and all that crap. Try to borrow it from someone so you don't have to buy it cause it isn't worth it. I guess half of it was alright but overall and compared to the others in the series I didn't like the book."
2,The Series Takes a Side Road to Hell,"The Wizard's first and only rule should be that fantasy fiction series cannot be longer than 5 books. The leaders of the ""Fantasy Fiction Writers Guild"" should pass a resolution to this effect. If you have read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time mess, or just about any other writer including Goodkind that has tried to take his/her series beyond 5 books you know that it is like a train going off the end of a broken bridge into a deep gorge.Goodkind has obviously run out of story, so he takes this book down a side road to the psychotic world of Anderith. A whole bunch of self-serving useless characters are introduced, examined in depth, and then killed off to add absolutely nothing to the story line.At least Goodkind keeps to his theme of rape and torture of innocent women. I was beginning to think he might be loosing his touch, but the good leaders of Anderith have redeemed him.A hard read at best."
3,Just a tangential story,"This book has nothing much to do with the rest of the series: it is a thinly veiled parable about modern politics. The fictional country of Anderish could easily be the United States -- politically correct, morally bankrupt, and intellectually dishonest. It is easy to see the ""alleged"" corruption and spinning of the Clinton administration in Anderish's leaders (and their wives), including sexual deceit, punishment of dissenters, and selling out to foreign powers for personal gain. It is an interesting parable, but faithful readers of the series could skip over this book without missing much."
5,A great continuance of the sword of truth fantasy series!,"Terry Goodkind really does well in continueing his series with the kind of storytelling that had me always looking forward to reading in any of my spare time that I had. I was only disapointed by one thing though, where is Adie, did she disappear or what?"
2,"OK, I PAID, I READ, THEN I SLEPT","I just couldn't wait for this book and I bought it the day it came out and I started reading it. The first 40 pages were quite good and seemed to me like Goodkind has done it again. However i was wrong oh boy was I wrong. This book is just plain bad, it has 300 pages with chracters that doesn't even matter, some parts of the book is pretty good [hence the 2 stars]the ending was quite good although a little to fast. I just wish that the book was focused on the main chracters and the problem more ALOT MORE."
2,This isnt the end to the series is it?,"TSOF was a good read, but its nothing compared to hi other books, this book was kind of dull, but im sure his next book will rock, the order are in the midlands, zedd will teach richard, hopefully the next book will be nothing but blood and magic :)"
1,"I have not read Soul of the Fire, therefore cannot rate it.","Sadly, I have to say that I have not yet read ""Soul of the Fire."" I would like to comment on the rest of the series, however. First, I believe this is a phenominal series. Goodkind proves himself to be one of the best Authors I've read. Not only is his series unique and imaginative, but well written and enthralling also. I encourage anyone who has not read this series to read it. I've found that the world created in this book is so real that, unlike some fantasy, it seems true to life. I am thoroughly looking forward to this book and hope it can answer some of the questions that the other books have left me hanging on for some time."
4,Another swerve by Mr. Goodkind,"Just when you think you've got this series down, and think you can get ahead of the game. Mr. Goodkind changes tactics in his writing, and storytelling....I loved Soul of Fire from the first page through the final page. From the changing face of the New World, to the growing threat from the Old World in the form of the Imperial Order. This book is about more than only that, we watch as Richard further comes to learn and understand about his magic that he cannot control, all while attempting to stop probably the deadliest plague visited on the lands by the chimes. This book picked up where Temple of the Winds left off, and left you ready for it's follow up Faith of the Fallen."
3,Disappointing...but the second half is good.,"Soul of the Fire was a bit of a chore. The first half of the book kind of plods along like T.G. wasn't really sure what he wanted to write. However, the story really picks up in the second half. (It took me three weeks to get through the first half of the book and two days for the second.) By the end of the book I was a believer again...and then it abruptly ended, leaving me panting for the next book.I am still trying to figure out what Goodkind has against Kahlan and Richard. After book four I sort of expected him to find new ways to advance the story, other than torturing the main characters AGAIN (and from the reviews I've read it doesn't improve in book six.)I did catch some of the political references mentioned in the other reviews, but it didn't bother me all that much, a lot of writers do that (even good old Tolkien.)If you've been following the series and liked it so far then you have to read it, just be prepared for a slow start."
4,My Role Model,"With the exception of Hank Jones, I can think of no other living pianist who has appeared on more recordings with more great players than Barry Harris. It would be understandable if Harris became elusive, or ""protected"" his legendary status by recording with the best or nobody at all. Instead he's obviously happy to be appearing with a ""merely"" competent, journeyman group of musicians, mixing it up with an audience that seems delighted by his personal as well as his musical communicativeness. His audience-participation tune, ""7-4-3,"" is a gimmicky, obvious premise, but it's tastefully executed and, doggone it, people like it. No wonder that at age 75, Barry has outlived most of his peers by several decades."
4,Time is running out,"The author gives his version of connecting the dots between various prophetic end times passages from the Bible. Those dots lead to present day technological developments that were accurately describe by the prophets in the most descriptive terms that they could relate to from their experience. Not an easy read, but thought provoking."
1,Boo!,"This work tries to teach intermediate algebra and some trig, but its approach is poor. I especially loved how the examples were extremely easy to solve, but the problems were impossible. I used this book for AlgII/Trig and Limits(Precalculus). Unfortunately, it required much use of my TI-89 to get my usual A+."
2,Save your money,"I brought it online without taking a look at it before. It is useless, save you money."
1,wasted investment,"This book is a complete waste of time and money. Not only can the information be found in the manual, or the internet, the info is often WRONG!! Avoid it!"
3,very simplified,"I think if you don't have much experience decorating cakes and you do better being shown than reading, then this would be a good video for you. However, if you can, take a Wilton's class instead. They're taught at Hobby Lobby and Michaels stores."
5,Great Rug,This product was everything I expected it to be. My grandson will enjoy this for a long time. Will consider more items like this in the future.
2,Causes Skin Allergy,"The mat caused a terrible and very bad skin allergy on my son.Looks like the paint was not treated correctly. I have to put the mat under the sun and wash it with soap and dry it again under the sun for several day. But now, my son does not want to use it anymore for fear to have an allergy again."
2,Teal Ray Stewert's revolving door,"After the world/character building of the first section of this book (which was excellent) the next three parts just don't hold up in comparison. Both of Teal's endings, homeworld and with Terrel, felt rushed and tacked on after hundreds of pages of mostly dull exposition finally getting him there. One thing is for sure, this guy sure could get around, which was probably the only thing a miserable creature like Teal took any pleasure in."
2,Be Careful!,"If you read anything by Farwell make sure that you reference other sources as he tends to rewrite history to his own liking. This is especially obvious in his biography of Stonewall Jackson. Time after time, he chooses to portray Jackson in a bad light; giving deference to accounts by people with an ""axe to grind"" while dismissing favorable accounts by those closest to Jackson."
4,Best Jenny Yet!,"This is the best J.Lo album yet.1. Still 10/10 Best upbeat song on the CD2. Loving You 6/10 Okay, but gets repetitive and boring3. I'm Glad 9/10 Catchy and Fun with sweet lyrics4. The One 9/10 I love this song. Both versions5. Dear Ben 7/10 Cute and sweet,, but short6. All I Have 9/10 Awesome song. One of the best!7. Jenny From the Block 9/10 Upbeat and Fun8. Again 7/10 Nice ballad9. You Belong To Me 8/10 Not bad...Grew on me.10. I've Been Thinking One of the worst on the album11. Baby, I love You 2/10 Boring!12. The One 10/10 My favorite track on the album. Very romantic!Great album if you are in love. Romantic!"
4,DON'T be fooled by the rocks that I got!,I am STILL jenny from the block! DON'T MESS WITH J LO! you WILL GET MESSED UP!
3,Great Vocal Range,"This is Jennifer's fourth album, and it's still pretty good. The only disappointing thing is that there isn't alot of ""J.LO"" on it from the previous albums. She has a really good vocal range on this album, and on a lot of songs, her voice sounds really sweet. Her duet with LL Cool J is probably one of the best songs on here. I haven't really listened to much since I just got, but from what I have heard, I like. Overall, it's a pretty good CD, but not as great as the past three. I would still recommend buying it, although you might want to listen to more than the three singles that have already been released (All I Have, Jenny From the Block, and I'm Glad)."
2,Stick To Acting!,"This album is pretty much a disaster. The only songs that I really liked were ""Baby I Love You"" and ""All I Have"". ""Jenny From The Block"" was just ok, but laughable lyrically as JLo tries to claim that she's not affected by her riches at all. The rest of the CD just doesn't really click. One of the worst song is ""Dear Ben"" which, well, I don't need to explain, just listen to it. Yeah, Jennifer Lopez needs to stick to acting. This album definitely proves that Jennifer Lopez can't sing and needs to stick to acting. The vocals here are not that impressive. Her last cd ""J. Lo"" was actually kinda good, but this is just plain bad. Pass this one up! Enjoy... well, enjoy the two songs I mentioned. :)"
1,Booo!,"""This Is Me..Then"" really describes the singer she was ""then"" and now. I've only listened to this CD a couple of times only because I was trying to convince myself that it wasn't that bad (considering that I paid for it), but I just couldn't bring myself to like it! I'm sorry, but two thumbs DOWN!"
1,What was that?,"I dont even want to waste my time writing this, but i really loved that first single (Jenny from the block) this album is trash, J-Lo can't sing, and she needs to stick to acting. I should have just bought the single. DO NOT BUY THIS."
5,I love it!,I know just I fall in love with this album truthfully.It's very lovely.J.Lo is so charming.
1,Childs Play,"Is she kidding us with these lyrics? It sounds as though a seventh grader wrote them while daydreaming in class!! From I'm Glad to Baby I love you she drones on and on with mind numbing lyrics and a mediocre singing voice. She should get back with Puff, at least then her songs were a little more interesting!"
2,The definition of narcissism,"So if ""Jenny From The Block"" is so ""real,"" as she repeatedly insists on album after album, why does she have to throw her riches in our face (""don't be fooled by the rocks that I rock,"" ""I used to have a little now I have a lot"") before letting us know how ""real"" she is? Give me a break. A real woman, with class, would never throw her riches in her audiences' faces. It just shows how low these lyrics are. A superstar like J Lo could surely hire a person with brains to write these songs. And she needs to quite trying to sing R&B (and rely on tired, used up samples)! One of the few highlights on this album is her remake of Carly Simon's ""You Belong To Me,"" which is in her range, and she really pulls it off. J Lo, my dear, take a hint, there's nothing wrong with not singing R&B, just sing good songs in your range and stop singing about how rich you are."
1,Perfect album for self-masochist,"If you consider yourself one who enjoys self-abuse, or even the abuse of others, then this is the album for you. Few other works are able to reach this plateau. Yoko Ono did it, and now J. Lo.Not only are the lyrics stilted and disgustingly vain, but the liner notes are as horrible as this ""actress'"" body of work via celluloid. If I had to describe this album it would be this: a pile of wretched trash, floating atop a dung heap on the river sewage, it's captain one J.Lo. -- a pseudo film ""star"" and self-styled ""singer.""Caution: should you listen to this album more than two times in a row you run the risk of suicide.Please for the love of life and all that is pure and innocent in this world, stop J.Lo. She cannot be allowed to contaminate the airwaves any longer. Put an end to her miserable career by burning all J.Lo CD's. Do it for the children."
5,jen's best album,"When I heard thet Jennifer Lopez was releasing her thrid album I immeditley knew I had to buy it. I absolutley love it. It is by far (in my opinion) the best she has ever done. It shows her real talent for singing in these songs. My favorite songs are I'm Glad, The one, Dear Ben, Again, I've been Thinking,Loving You, Jenny from the Block and All I Have. Jennifer Lopez is my favorite artist and actor and she is the best. For anyone who hasn't got this Cd yet you should buy it."
2,View it as an experiment,"I wish Jennifer Lopez would go back to her Latin roots instead of this cheesy venture into pop-hip hop. The lyrics to ""Jenny from the Block"" are embarassing! It's an immature song filled with bravado and bragging, despite her attempts in the song to protray herself as an everyday girl. ""All I Have"" is actually a smooth hip-hop influenced song, but who'se to say its success isn't more due to LL Cool J than Jenny's attempt at hip-hop?"
2,sad sad,"this album should have been titled this is me....not the weak vocals and sappy lyrics on this album force me to say this cd solded more for the body on the cover then the content as with most of her projects.basically this cd consisted mostly of love love and more love. it was horrible and thats putting it nicly as with many lackluster cds you can always find a couple of songs that are good, on her cd there are about 4 and her song baby i love you my goodness who wrote that hilary duff i believe a three year old would come up with better more imaginative lyrics i lable this is me....then a waste of money.......now"
1,What happened to J Lo?,"I was convinced that this CD was going to be even better than the others. NOT!!! There is only one song that I can even stomach and that is getting played out! What happened to the Jennifer Lopez/JLo that made us get up and dance? I can't believe she went this route with her new CD. I wish I had known what the CD was like before I bought it. I hope she can recover from this one. She'll turn into a has-been with lyrics like these. Don't do it to yourself JLo. I hope life with Ben isn't making you boring. JLO, get in touch with Puff before you make your next CD. He can probably help get you out of that lyrical rut you must be in."
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this CD on the day it was released, knowing that it had more of an ""old school"" feel to it. I was expecting more ""Jenny From the Block""-type stuff, but a large part of the CD are ballads that made me think Jennifer Lopez should stick to dancing instead. There are probably three songs on the album that I listen the whole way through on, but I find myself hitting the ""skip"" button more than I thought I would be. I understand she was trying to expand and try something different, but the album doesn't feel polished, and it was a disappointment, at least for me."
2,Unfortunately rushed...,"Ok, so I'm a Jenny Lo fan, but this album seems too have been RUSHED out of the studio. The songs seem too bland, and there is really no meat to this album. With the exception of ""Loving You"" which has a very nice beat and hook...the album is not as exciting as I had hoped. Jennifer doesn't even sing the choruses to a MAJORITY of the songs! I'm very disappointed, yet I am hoping for something more with her next album. I think she should wait at LEAST 2 years to do another album, and hope that they won't jeapordize the credibility as an artist that she has yet to earn by shoving albums out that aren't worthy of release. She needs to take a lesson from Toni, or Mariah, or Mary J."
1,very poor,"I enjoyed JLo's last album a lot, but this one is just plain bad. I had tried to force myself to listen to it a few times to get used to the music, but I just have to put this CD away. With the exception of ""Jenny from the Block"", all of the other songs sound so similar. Yes, it's the first time I would say that JLo attempted ballads, but her voice/skill just doesn't make it for these types of songs... at least not yet. I'm very disappointed... don't waste your money!"
1,POOR J.LO,"oh gosh, this album is a total jerk! don't buy itbetter if j.lo stop singing coz this album proved that."
1,...WHAT is this???!,...I like one song. Still. Everything is unacceptable. Stick to acting. Its what ya' do best. And u do it very well. Not even worth a review.
3,eh.. it's decent,"I kno the CD has been out for a couple of weeks, but if you haven't gotten it yet.. I wouldn't pay 16 dollars for the CD if i were you lol. Its not worth it. It's not completely horrible or anything, but it's not worth 16 dollars. It's got a few good songs on it though.. The one (version 2) and All I Have (featuring LL Cool J)are the best songs on the CD.. The One (The first version), Again, Jenny From The Block (even tho it's damn near played out.. stupid radio stations that play things to death) and You Belong To Me are the other decent tracks on the CD that's 6 good songs outta 12.. which, like i said, isn't bad.. but it's also not worth the 16 bucks. So, i'm glad I didn't spend 16 dollars on it lol. (Yay for being outta town and calling the radio station and getting invited to come to the station and chill with the (CUTE) DJ and get free CDs =] hehe)"
1,VERY Disappointed in JLo,"I bought this CD the other day thinking ""Oh it is Jennifer Lopez it has to be good...because her last album was great""...Boy was I sadly mistaken! The whole album is nothing but a bunch of slow love songs, with the exception of 1-2 songs. It is not your typical JLo, I guess Ben Affleck inspired this WHOLE CD! She really shows no vocal talent, she hits no high notes....I think she needs to stick to acting from now on! Please listen to this CD online or in a store that has headphones before you buy it to make sure you like it! I know I DIDN'T LIKE IT ALL!"
1,when life imitates the very worst of art...,"Is it only me or has anyone else noticed that Jenny from the Block is J.Lo's version of Eva Peron's Don't Cry for me Argentina? You know: ""And as for fortune, and as for fame, I never invited them in, though it seemed to the world they were all I desired?""There is, however, a BIG difference. Webber's dreck is tinged with irony. J LO wants us to take her seriously as she parades around in high heels and a thong repeating her mantra. She even exploits her new relationship for more press.You, the consumer: Don't you deserve better than this ?"
1,Terrible,"This album is terrible. What a humongous waste of my hard-earned money. Don't take my word for it, check it out of your town library, which will inevitably have hundreds of unwanted copies."
3,How Dissapointing,"I think this is a good album if you're driving a car, but since I don't have a car, this album was pretty dissapointing. I have always loved Jenny's dance numbers and unfortunately, there were hardly any to be found. Most of the songs were ballads, and that is not J-Lo's strengths.She's not a bad singer, but she works best with hot dance numbers that get you moving.Loved her first album, liked her second, but her new one-well, it leaves a lot to be desired.If you are a fan of Jennifer's, you will be dissapointed too, skip it."
1,Jenny is just a girl from the Bronx,"This girl doesn't know how to keep it real, but she sure does now how to represent on all the tabloids. Her art is more on the surface than it is deep. It is quite apparent with her on again off again relationship with Ben Affleck that she's more concerned with glitz, glamor, and making a headline than she is with content. Just ask her ex-husband the nice guy she kicked to the curb to go out with Ben. What with all of her stupid films and her ridiculous media circus relationships at this point an time J Lo is nothing more than a parody of her self."
1,AWFUL!,"AWFUL! SIMPLY AWFUL! LOPEZ CAN'T SING! SHE IS SO RIDICULOUS! THE ONLY THAT SHE KNOWS IS TO COME AROUND NACKED! ALL OF THE SONGS ARE SO BAD, WITH BAD LYRICS AND BAD MUSIC AND THE WORST OF ALL, LOPEZ WHEN SHE ""SINGS""! OH MY GOD! SHE HASN'T ANY TALENT IN SINGING!THIS ALBUM IS THE WORST THAT I HAVE TAKEN IN MY LIFE AND FOR GOD'S SHAKE, DON'T EVEN THINK THAT I BOUGHT IT! I TOOK IT AS A PRESENT AND FROM THE FIRST TIME THAT I LISTENED IT... IT WENT DIRECTLY TO THE GARBAGE!"
2,Yawn,"A Market Wizards style of book interviewing various floor traders, fund managers and commodities traders. Maybe I'm not that informed, but the only one of the people were interviewed was Toby Crabel. Koppel asks the exact same question to every single person with a whole array of varying answers. To sum it up, nearly everyone had early success, blown out their account, and then recovered. The revolving theme seems to be that traders need to be competitive, disciplined and have almost an obsessive drive to find a way to make it.I did find the reading to be a little more interesting near the end with some more insightful interviews. Overall, there is too much chatting and very much talk about trading. Therefore, a reader would not expect to find anything all that useful to apply to his own methods.Great sleeping aid."
1,license plate bracket,"The seller said that this would fit my 2000 Honda Civic. Well, that was pretty inaccurate. It did not fit and I had to cut the bracket in order to make it fit. It was a pretty crappy experience overall. Thanks for nothing."
5,gaia happy and rebellious,"gaia has finally found some happiness in life. with the helpof her friends ed and mary she is being a normal rebellios teen.but her uncle lokia and foster mom ella are not pleased. they have decided that if this undisciplined behavior keeps up, thenthe source of the problem will have to be neutralized. also, eventhough mary has kicked her drug addiction, her dealer is after hebecause she still owes him money. this is a thrilling and quiteinteresting book. could not put it down."
4,Review of Horizon treadmill,"The machine was finally received after refusing the first due to damage. The second also had the shipping carton absolutely destroyed but after inspection by the delivery man and us we determined that everything was present and undamaged. We had a little trouble assembling due to some of the bolts or sockets having either paint on them or threads not cut cleanly. After assembly the machine operated up to our expections. The one thing that was noted was the quietness when in operation. It is also compact in size compared to our old one, an advantage for us."
5,Perfect 4 so cheap!,"I am a cabinet maker and yes I do installs so were on our knees all the time. I was looking for a new pair of pads when I came upon these. First thought ""To Cheap"" 2nd. Thought, ""what the heck there cheap"".These are the BEST knee pads I have ever owned! There are super comfortable, don't end up around your ankles (wearing them over pants right now), don't cut off the circulation or hurt the back of the knee, light weight, one strap easy on easy off. Buy em'! I got 4 so I could get free shipping. I gave a set to my guys no complaints only praise. So don't let the price scare you off."
1,does NOT work in place of BCI-21 in a Canon i360 printer,Forget my previous comments about this cartridge not working with my printer. I mistakenly ordered the wrong cartridge. The seller and product are at no fault.
3,Different but ok,"We love Bob but this one isn't his best... Has Elton John in it which is kind of strange but whatever... Kind of boring and hard storyline for a 2 year old to follow, but in the end, a nice message of the importance of family."
5,Great for young gymnasts.,"This is a great DVD for your young gymnast-to-be! My 8-yr old daughter is a Level 5 gymnast and won the movie ""Stick It"" at the gym's raffle. After previewing it, I decided to NEVER let her see it. It was a terrible movie, and unlike ""Ice Princess"" does nothing positive for the sport. I found this alternative online and she loves watching it. She has seen it about a dozen times and it has even made her more enthusiastic about competing and learning new tricks! The DVD explains the sport really well, and has interviews with different ages and levels of gymnasts. They divide the events up into separate chapters and even have footage of a meet. It's a great alternative to the disgusting ""Stick It."""
5,Great Intro to Gymnastics for young Children,"I enrolled my 3 year old son in gymnastics. I bought this video because I wanted him to be able to grasp what gymnastics is all about. At three and four years old, they are learning all the basic skills and safety, but I wanted him to be able to see what the long range goal was...what he would be working toward. It really worked for him. He enjoys watching the video every few months, and I really believe it made him more comfortable with his gymnastics class. He also learned a lot of terminology, too. He loves gymnastics, and tells me often that he can't wait to be big enough to work on the 'big kid' equipment."
2,"DULL, DULL, DULL.",Read it. Forgot it. . .except for the fact I see it everwhere and I just love the title. I really wanted to read some good stories with fantasy mediveal themes. This was not it. I so vaguelly remember the one by Marianne Willman (it was fun). Do yourself a favor and AVOID THIS BOOK.
4,Killer Curses,"I've been looking for the movie Venom starring Jonathan Jackson and Agnes Bruckner for several years now and I just happen to stumble upon it at my local Walmart today wrapped up with theThe Midnight Horror Collection: Flesh Eating Zombies Seriesfor only five dollars. Not a bad price for a few horror movies. I have already seen Children of the Corn 666, which is one of the better sequels. Of course Dust Devil is the edited version instead of the hard-to-find director's cut, but I'm still looking forward to watching the movie. I have heard of El Muerto (The Dead One), but I have never seen it. As for the other two movies, I have never heard of them before.Disc One:The Dead One (El Muerto; 2007; 88 minutes; Rated PG-13)Children of the Corn 666: Isacc's Return (1999; 82; Rated R)Venom (2005; 85 minutes: Rated R)Dust Devil (Released in 1993, but filmed in 1991; 87 minutes; Rated R)Disc Two:The Final Patient (2005; 100 minutes; Not Rated)Beneath the Mississippi (2008; 109; Not Rated)"
5,I'm From Fitchburg,"At a class reunion committee meeting, a classmate recommended this book highly for youngsters! We are happy to pass along this recommendation to others! Hopefully, they'll stop and enjoy Fitchburg's natural spots as well as the book!"
2,This book was kind of boring,"I am seven years old. I don't think I understood the book. There weren't very many words and it wasn't that exciting. I would have rather been Henry's friend because the work seemed like it might be fun, and I would ride a train for anything! I didn't really like the book because I don't really like the illustrations. I like books about more real things, because bears don't walk on two feet, and they don't ride trains.I did like the blackberry part where Henry finds a blackberry bush."
5,The definitive rock music box set,"This one's for the fans, definitely. I would suggest anyone who's never heard Alice in Chains (where have you been?) to start with their previous records ""Dirt"",or ""Jar of Flies."" This box set pretty much contains every worthy AIC song ever written, it's 3 discs spanning the bands career from their early days until their latest self titled record, and an extra CD-Rom disc with some cool extras. Alice in Chains are a legacy of rock music, and sadly even with frontman's Layne Staley's death, this is a group real rock fans will remember forever. Great, great music, if you're into AIC and still don't have this, BUY IT NOW, the $...price tag is worth every penny."
4,awesome,I received the music bank in perfect conditon and in perfect timing. My boyfriend loves it! It's all he will listen to.
4,"Nice box, even with padding","In _Music Bank_ you get four CDs, three that contain music (with a number of previously unavailable tracks) and one that contains multimedia (some videos and a very goofy computer game where you attempt to liberate the spirits of the band members), a thin booklet (one of the pictures in there demonstrates why Jerry Cantrell used to be known as ""Lefty""), and a cardboard spacer (to make the box look bigger) where two more CDs could have been. The material is great, but we could have used even more of it. The sound is spectacularly great, though, so _Music Bank_ is worth it for that alone."
4,Stirring and engaging,"This book is emotionally packed and made me weep buckets. In it, Naylor displayes her gift to write with a stirring, emotional power. Although I do like the Women better than the Men of Brewster Place - just because some of the men have a real hard time acting right - I'm glad that Naylor wrote this book so that the men could finally have their say. And what a say they have, and their words are important enough that I recommend that people looking to read a good story should listen."
1,What !,Was Gloria just trying to get a book out to compete with the barrage of fiction being released by black writers or what? She could not have been seriously thinking that this book was of any value.The characters were week. The storylines were not in line with the way they were portrayed in the Women of Brewster Place.I got this book when it first came out. I read it quickly and nearly tossed it down in disgust. I went to the post office and mailed it to my best friend because I wanted to see if I was crazy for thinking it was so bad (but I didn't want her to waste the money herself).I was truly disappointed. I expected so much more from one of my favorite writers of the 80's. I know she can do better because she has on all previous attempts.
2,Funny but too short,"We are trying to get pregnant, so after reading all the good reviews, I bought this book for my husband. The book is funny, but so tiny, it takes you less than an hour to read from cover to cover. As soon as you become interested in what the author is talking about, he jumps to the next subject. Very disappointing."
1,"Not informative, not funny","There is nothing informative or at all funny about this book. Basically, it's like someone allowed that guy in the office who thinks he's funny to write down what he would say if he were to do a stand-up comedy routine on pregnancy. All of the ""jokes"" and premises are actually just rip-offs of something he saw on TV, and he only selected the unfunny stuff to very poorly reproduce.Save your money, save your time."
3,My Boys Can Swim Review,"This book was smaller than I thought it would be for 9.99. My fiance liked that is was small, but he said that most of the book was about the author's own experiences and opinions, not really as educational and informational as he would have liked. A good book for someone who does not want to read very much and looking for a good laugh. My fiance was looking for something with more general prenancy info. This book could have spent more time on each trimester."
2,too lame!,"I'm all for trimming down pregnancy facts, but this book is a little too lean. For example, it basically states, Nothing really happens in the first 3 months. In my opinion that is not helpful advice for poor clueless husbands."
3,Guy's View of Pregnancy,I bought this book for my husband when I was pregnant with my son. I also decided to read the book (it's only about 70 pages) and found it to be humorous. My husband even read it too.
1,He thought it was corny,"I bought this for my Daddy-to-be thinking it would be cute to stick in a funny book with all the other serious books we planned to get through before baby arrived. Initially he seemed interested and even picked it up to read the same evening I gave it to him, but soon it ended up on the bookshelf with all the other discarded and/or previously read books. I later confronted him about the book, asking if he liked it or finished it. He confessed he felt it was stupid and not worth his time. Thankfully he was still interested in the serious books, so I didn't realyl care but I would warn others that this may be a little too... I'm not even sure the word, but not worth buying and/or reading. I would suggest checking it out at your local library before purchasing."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this book based on the consistently high reviews. I thought the author was kidding when he said you could read this on a short flight or in a few trips to the john. In fact, the book is extremely short, and contains very little information to help the expectant dad. The extent of the first trimester chapter was, basically, your wife may get morning sickness, and she may not. Don't name your kid something easy to make fun of. I get that the author is trying to be clever and witty, but it comes off as trite and unintelligent. The misspellings don't help.In short, if you want to read this book, at least you won't waste a lot of time doing it. I would save your 8 bucks and spend it on something meatier."
2,"Cute and funny, but devoid of nutritional value.","I wanted to buy my husband a good book to read since we are expecting our first child. Based on the high star rating I picked this one. Now my husband is not much of a reader but even he was taken aback when we opened the package and out came this slender, tiny book. Clocking in at 92 pages in big type and several cartoons, we correctly assumed that there really wouldn't be much there. The book was definitely funny and had us giggling a few times, but when he finished my husband was disappointed and really hadn't learned much if anything.If you want a book about the realities of pregnancy, written in a humorous and engaging way, try out Jenny McCarthy's BookBelly Laughs: The Naked Truth about Pregnancy and Childbirth. This book is aimed more at women, but has a similar feel to ""My Boys Can Swim!"" while managing to convey a lot more information."
2,Less than expected,"I wanted to buy my husband a book to read to understand what my body and my mind was going through during this pregnancy. I bought this book because my husband isn't exactly the avid reader. I was expecting that it would be detailed in what I was going through as well as what he could expect, but we both were less than happy about it. It barely touches the topics of pregnancy, let alone dives into detail. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are looking for a quick read about pregnancy that is otherwise common sense."
1,Insulting to any man who cares,"This book is written for a lowbrow audience. I consider myself a typical, caring husband and soon-to-be father and this book was insulting. Unless you are really out in left field regarding the issues of pregnancy, or have a really short attention span (its more pamphlet than book) do not buy this."
5,My wife laughed so hard she nearly gave birth,"My wife bought this book for me after seeing a great review on it in the Chicago Tribune. Before I had a chance to read it, my wife grabbed it, and before I knew it, I heard thundering guffaws from the bedroom. We ended up reading it together. All I can say is, this book is hilarious. I've bought two copies for friends, and they've had the same reaction."
1,Absolute Crap,"This book is completely awful!!! I bought this book for my husband, thinking that it would help him better understand the issues of pregency. The comments about childbirth classes and having an epidural are awful (you are told that your wife should be given one, whether she wants one or not. The book never gives the many many reasons why an epidual may not be used)!!! This book is completely written from one person's point of view and lacks anything creditable!! I am debating whether or not I should even give this awful creation to my husband. Don't waste your money."
2,uhhhhhhh....,"It takes about a half hour to read this book, and much of it is spent wondering where your money went. Really, the only thing you can come away with on this book is that you could have written a longer one and you could have been funnier."
1,"iriver clix is great, this device is horrible",Bought this device instead of using a 1/8 inch jack plugged into my tape player. Not a good decision. I live in south florida. I have tried many stations and they all come out with static and interference. It makes it almost impossible to enjoy the music. I would not purchase in less you live in the middle of nowhere..
4,Quality cable bag,"This is a quality bag and fully capable of holding long jumper cables. I purchased a 4 gauge - 16ft jumper cable set and this little bag can handle it and more.I like this bag because it's quality is excellent and there is enough room to truly carry any length of jumper cables and even some small handtools inside.The only negative is that its handles are kind of ""cheesy"" and could be made with a little more heft to them. This should not keep one from buying this product because this bag is built to last - probably take it to my grave.Overall, I like it and think it would be a most excellent and practical gift for anyone.I gave this a four-star rating because I just don't like the ""cheesy"" look and feel of the handles."
2,Not what I ordered,"Just bought this as a Christmas gift for my father and when I opened the box it was not what I had ordered. Still the same team, but not the style that was posted online.A little disappointed because the one advertised was the one he wanted.Will not be making another purchase."
3,Decent reacher for the money,I have had many of these reachers over the years. This one works like most of them. Most of these are made in china now and are not as good as they used to be. In my opinion purchasers for these manufactors or dist. have not used these items themselves they look the same but are not as strong the claws on those made in the USA. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Complete Waste of Money!,This did keep my jack russell mix occupied - she loved and destroyed it. She had completely chewed off all the knobs within 20 minutes. dont' buy this for any dog that is a chewer.
1,Francesca C,Well I thought it was a great toy until my lab puppy chewed the knobs off.Don't get me wrong he was very excited(alittle too excited)The toy lasted 30 mins and it didn't work anymore.
1,Not for chewers,This ball is not for chewers. There are many parts a dog can chew off and possibly get choked on.
2,Exicting for people wishing to watch their cat respond in an awkward manner,"It's obnoxiously loud. It's pretty funny. for 10 seconds, once it gets it's self stuck up against the wall. It's too heavy for cats... dog would perhaps enjoy it more. Or Toddlers."
1,Not made for dogs teeth,"This product was destroyed by my small Shih tzu's within 3 minutes of giving it to them. The plastic bumps are very soft plastic and have precut lines in them, which makes them even easier to pull apart. I wrote to Amazon about this and they quickly refunded my money, no questions asked. This should not be advertised as a pet bumble ball."
1,"Poor product, great company.","I bought this for my dog. At first my dog was afraid of it but when I gave it to her at another time, she was playing with it and liked it. But after only a while, it stopped working and it wasn't the batteries. I returned it to EntirelyPets and they refunded my money/shipping. They were great!!!Maddie Couture"
2,She loved it but it broke,"I have a 10 pound boston terrier, she loved this thing so much and it only worked for about 5 minutes. Something came loose in it and now its broken."
1,Waste of money!,Don't waste your money. Died after 2 days. Changing batteries did nothing to get working again.
5,Great entertainment,"This toy will totally entertain your dog and free up your time to do other things. My dog was engaged with this toy for about 20 - 25 minutes, loving it, chasing and wearing himself out. He goes to it daily - has not grown tired of it."
5,Great toy for kids,"Bumble balls were originally made for kids, but for some reason they stopped and started making them for dogs. My son loves to chase the bumble ball all over the house. Great toy!"
2,Not as great as expected,A fun toy and design. But it doesn't bounce or bumble around as much as I expected it too. Just kinda vibrates and slowly changes direction. Would be better if it bounced more and had great direction changes.
2,Nice idea for a dog toy but it quickly breaks.,"My dog really loved this toy, but sadly she can't play with it anymore because it broke less than 24 hours of her getting it. Firstly, the reinforcement cones inside the ball came unglued one by one, each time jamming the motor unit. I spent much time interupting her play session, in order to take the ball apart to get each cone out, before reassembling it. All the while my poor dog looked on with great frustration. After all that, the motor was working but the ball would no longer move, so I had to jiggle it about myself (which rather defeats the object!) In the end, I had to put the ball away as I could smell the motor burning itself out. I'm angry considering that this toy wasn't cheap (plus the amount of shipping costs). It will be too much hassle for me to send it back to the U.S. to get a replacement."
1,A waste!,"I think this is intended for a toddler not a dog. My dog chewed off one of the knobs in seconds. She doesn't find interest in the movement, she would rather just chew the knobs which doesn't take much! I don't see how you can create a toy not durable enough to even pick up. When my dog picked it up she put a hole in one of the knobs. What a waste of money, I wish I could return it."
2,The Crazy Dog Bumble Ball is not so Crazy after all.,"I couldn't wait to get the ball, having an extremely active Boston Terrior. The package arrived, opened it, and there were stickers all over it saying supervise your pet and not to let them chew the rubber tips off! I reviewed the add on Amazon and nowhere did it say that they should not chew off the tips. Dogs are dogs, if they catch something jumping around the first instinct is to bite it. I think the J-B Wholesale Pet supplies should have a warning before buying item page."
4,Funny for a while,"My pet really enjoyed it for a couple of weeks, but after that she got tired of it.It is a cool novelty any way."
5,Dogs love this,This is the best entertainment for my dog. She loves it. She will sit and just look at it when we do not have it down for her to play with.
2,It's ok.,I bought this toy for my brother's Mini Schnauzer. The first time I turned it on he ran away. He's not afraid of it anymore and makes the weirdest noises when he plays with it. He plays with it for about five minutes then he gets bored. He actually learned to turn it on by himself. But like all toys and some treats you should supervise your pet.
1,Great toy but short lived,"My dog LOVES this toy. The problem is, it doesn't last for mjore than a couple days. I thought it was the battery, or a defective toy, but I bought a couple others over the last couple years and the same thing always happens. I have a yorkie and when he grabs it and plays with it, it must break apart inside and interfer with the bouncing mechanism. And the knobs break off way too easy. Too bad. Wish they would make a better one."
2,YELLOW PIECE BROKE IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES,"My dog loved the toy but when he put it in his mouth the yellow piece that turns it on & off broke off instantly. I have a german shepard mix who is 1 yrs old, the toy lasted a mere 5 minutes. He still trys to move the toy around so that it starts jumping but without that piece it was useless."
3,Not for all dogs,"I bought this because my dog loves to chase thrown objects, but gets bored once they hit the ground. I thought that a constantly moving ball like this would be fun for her. Unfortunately, she is not interested in this at all in fact, when the motor is running she gets scared.I tried getting 4 other of my families dogs to play with this with no luck. Their reactions varied from ignoring it to being afraid. All of these dogs are small 10-15lb dogs, the ball is fairly small, so size should not be the issue, but it does create a fair amount of noise when running.I am sure if you have a very energetic dog that is not easily frightened this would be great, but for my dogs it is no good."
4,Colorful Poop,"This is another Great toy for pups of all sort. The Bumble is definitely there. My dog would play with this toy for hours, she would hold it in her mouth looking like Kathryn Hepburn in a helicopter ride. I had fun watching, as she would play and chew the knobs off, this would also add the the specter of many colors in her poop, Beware if you do not want this toy to be damaged, She lived."
4,good baby toy,Gave to my 8 month old granddaughter and she loves it. My dog was afraid of it. Bounces all around on floors or rugs.
5,The cosmological equivalent of the bible.,"I do not know how Misner, Wheeler and Thorne did it. Aonce in a lifetime achievement. Pray that some day anothergroup of brilliant minds updates this. And you can use itto improve your upper body strenth, too!"
5,Great Bag,"This bag did just what I needed - cleaned up my trunk. I had cables, fix-a-flat, screwdrivers and everything else rolling around in my car and stashed where I could fit them (but still couldn't be found when needed). Now everything fits in this bag and looks great. I'm going to get one for my other car. Highly recommended."
1,$9 for a plastic bucket?,"I'm pretty sure we got a 5 gallon bucket at Home Depot for no more than $5. I guess it's a bulky item to ship... Are some people willing to pay the extra $$ for the convenience? Probably.. but if you have stores nearby, save the money."
2,Tom Robbins' Leftovers,"This book has its moments (like the parts about the superficiality of Dallas), but the writing is cliche-ridden and, after a while, pretty tedious. Many of the book's plot points are very easy to predict. Into the home stretch of the book, it was very hard for me to finish, or even care."
4,Lord Vishnu handles of fun!,"A delightfully clever, witty, and eccentric novel. This novel is so smoothly comprised you'll have trouble putting it down.I still have trouble NOT quoting this book, a definate must read for the reader who begs for a book that's original, fun and just plain intelligent!"
2,Could've been much better.,"This book is packed full of entertaining information that is worth reading, but not paying for; so I suggest that if you want to read this book, try borrowing it from a library or friend, read it, return it, and be done w/ it. Gary Jenkins has a reasonably well-developed vocabulary, but there is the whiff of imaturity about his writing as well. This book is heavily opinionated in some respects and this little fact gets obnoxious after awhile. He also tends to get off track; for instance, no one cares about some dude's crumbling marriage (not Lucas') and the book is about the story behind Star Wars, NOT American Graffitti. This book reads more like a biography rather than a book based solely on the production of 3 movies as the title suggests. But it is all kind of worth reading just to learn the interesting story behind the movies--if you don't have to pay for it."
1,Everybody gets a ride on the Star Wars gravy train,"EMPIRE BUILDING is a lightweight shoddy work tracing some of the history behind the making of the Star Wars Trilogy. Pieced together partly from new interviews, the book consists principally of pinches -- uncredited -- from the work of other writers.Even when acknowledging a source for his heavy-duty pilfering, the author usually manages to mispell the name of the magazine in question, suggesting the sort of heavy-duty committment to research that one might expect from a junior high schooler's first term paper. Don't bother with this one."
1,Expire Vitamins,Expire vitamins as 2 of the 3 vitamins I have ordered have been. I don't think buying things with expiration dates are a good thing to do on Amazon.
5,"Great speakers, good price!","I went searching for 4 speakers for my 99 pathfinder. Went to circuit city after they announced the closing, not impressed with the inventory or the price. I found these, installed them with a slight mod. to the speaker mount. They sound great for their size, and yes THEY DO HAVE BASS!"
5,Great Villancicos CD,American people dont know anything about this villancicos. This music reminds me my childhood. Now I want my baby girl to grow up litsening to this as well. Its just great for a good price too.
1,Tacky and disappointing,"Bad midi accompaniment, cheesy arrangements, children's voices are frequently flat and forced in tone. I was disappointed after hearing them praised so much. The quality of the recording leaves a lot to be desired, also. Those who appreciate fine children's singing should look elsewhere; Indianapolis Childrens Choirs, Tapiola Children's Choirs, St. Louis Children's Choirs, etc."
4,"Looks simple, but it's really a great help!","I ordered this without thinking much about how much help it would be. I've only used it a few times, but already I can see that I'll do as the other contractor/reviewer said and buy several for different types of jobs. This first one is holding assorted screws, bits, bit holders, tape measure, etc. so that when I'm starting work, I don't have to search through boxes and bottles for the things I'll need... I just grab the bag and go. I carry it by the outer strings rather than the loop handle in the middle and this pulls the top tight so nothing is likely to spill unless I drop it.I like it! Good purchase."
4,Bucket Boss review,"I bought the Bucket Boss bag but could not find a bucket to fit it in the UK. Apparently the size is standard is the US but not over here. I then had to order the bucket and the handle otherwise I would not have been able to use it. With the bucket it now all works perfectly. However, if you need to carry this bag for any length of distance I would not recommend it as it is not comfortable to carry for far, however, it is ideal for organisation as there are no zips to open etc and everything is freely accessible. I must say I did lose the rubber handle. I should have glued it on as without the rubber handle it is uncomfortable to hold. Hope his helps."
1,horrible,"With the open slit, the handle grip is always falling off.You think they would have invented away for the grip to stay on the bucket."
2,Rather heavy and narrow shoe,"I own a pair of Frye boots and love them so I thought the harness mule would be a good choice. They may very well be a good choice, but not for me. They are fairly heavy and too narrow - not the same fit as my boots. I had them stretched a bit so that improved them but not enough for me to wear them comfortably for any length of time."
3,heavy,"These shoes look great but they are very heavy and bulky when they're on your feet. I returned them, sadly, because I love mules and hoped they would work out."
5,Love these mules,I had to return my original purchase because I ordered a size 6.5 and I typically wear a 6 or 6.5 however the 6.5 was just too big. The size 6 fits perfectly. They are a bit on the heavy side but I feel that is a small inconvenience I will happily live with. This is a quality shoe that I am going to be wearing for many years.
2,Poor and unispired,"Very poor release from one of the greatest rock bands in history. Songs are very uninspired, and it looks like they rushed the production. There is not a single memorable moment in the album, just average tracks, with average solos. Not even close to Purpendicular (one of their better albums), and to tell the truth, maybe even with Abandon... and this means no good. C'mon guys, you can deliver much better than this. Ebay, here I go again..."
2,Oh Where Have You Gone Ritchie Blackmore ?,"In answer to the question where have you gone Ritchie Blackmore? ...He's an acoustic guitar player in his wifes band . This is not a knock on Steve Morse - he's an awesome guitar player , but in wake of the last four Deep Purple lps , its pretty evident that Blackmore was the driving force behind the band . Rapture Of The Deep is the latest in a line of cds containing two , ( maybe three if your lucky )good songs woven in a tapestry of filler . Money Talks , Girls Like That and Junkyard Blues aren't bad . Amazingly the best song imo is a ballad called Clearly Quite Absurd . Other than that this album stinks . In these days of anti piracy laws and seeing record companies flexing thier collective muscle , I as a consumer , feel as though i have had my pockets picked . Look for Rapture Of The Deep in a bargain bin near you ."
4,"Quickly read, and forgotten","The Plot:When Broadway producer Morris Block is killed, no one is really that upset about it. He has been blackmailing show-business people for years, and during a house party about 40 of his 49 guests have a motive to do away with him. NYC detective Jason Jones and private detective Necessary Smith team up to investigate the murder (and a few other deaths) and try to explain how the murderer could get out of a house surrounded by police and unbroken expanses of snow. And why he left a bloody handprint behind to taunt them.Review: Written in the breezy style of the post-WWII period, this is an easy to read mystery and has an okay puzzle at its core. I found the relationship between the all-too-accomodating policeman (who was a bit too Nero Wolfish for me -- he raises geraniums and is overweight) and the private eye too pat and hard-to-believe. Not in the league of the great Golden Age mysteries, but it was okay to pass the time commuting."
4,Stuck in a rut?,Good book for those followers of Christ who have been playing church or going through the motions with God.An honest and opened heart toward God is needed in reading this book.
4,Waking the Dead,I liked it very much. I don't like the requiement the I need to have a number of words to complete this review. Pain in the but.
4,Waking the dead,This book is an eye opener and a must read for anyone that experience problems in their lives. It explains why disasters will still occur.
4,Wildlough,"A very good adventure story that can be read on its on or as the 18th Redwall book, Tiria Wildlough, prophisied Queen High Rhulain of Green Isle, faces an army of feral cats when she attemts to free their otterslaves. Eventurly, they are freed and live their lives out on Green Isle. This would have been better if the villians hadn't always acted so stupid.-Emma D."
4,GIVE US MORE TONY,CAME TO THIS FROM VENGO.GREAT COMING OF AGE STORY.WHO HASN'T BEEN CRUSHED BY AN ADOLESCENT FIRST CRUSH.BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES EVERY TIME I WATCH.BTW COBY PLAYERS DO NTSC AS WELL AS PAL(SLEEPER HERE) BUT THEY DO PLAY REGION 1 AS WELL AS REGION 2 DVD'S.
3,Should've quit while they were ahead!,"I feared this would be a green, environmental message toon, but it tends toward an animals rights show. The laughs seem to take a back seat on such message shows. Buy it to complete your collection and remember to dust it off occassionally."
2,Futurama fans won't like it!,"If you are true-blue Futurama fan, you know exactly how characters are supposed to act and what they normally say. Was the script written during a writer's strike? I own every single episode of Futurama which are all on my iPod, so I watch them constantly. The ""A"" and ""B"" stories were okay, but the mini-story lines within the major-line stories were lame and irrelevant. I loved Bender's Game and especially Bender's Big Score, but this is the worst of the four. I originally gave this movie one star, but just because I am a true Futurama fan for life, I gave it an extra star for just existing. I still love you, Futurama!"
5,good shape,Very good and in a good shape. This old futurama movie is one of the must funniest movies I have ever seen
2,"Is this then, the untimely end of Futurama?","Disappointing on several levels, this installment of the Futurama movies is inconsistent, rambling, and has a rush-production feel to it. None of the movie length features measures up to the quality of the episodes, but as another reviewer observed, that was a rather high bar. FOX would have been better served to invest their money in another season or two and let the Futurama creative team do what it did best, the 22- minute episode.Fans like myself will want this for the sake of the completeness of their collections, but are unlikely to give it repeated viewings, to those who want to get to know the series, as I and others have admonished, start with the series episodes. The first movie was pretty good, but the last three were weak in comparison.The features had some nice moments but are nothing outstanding."
5,Great book! Why did I wait so long to read it? Hmm.........,"I first went to see the movie over the memorial day weekend. I enjoyed the movie so much, that I went out and bought the book the next day. Right from the beginning the book really went into so much more detail and covered every question that a careful observer could muster up. After I finally finished the book (I often had to read paragraphs two and three times to fully understand what certian characters were referring to), the movie script seemed boringly simple. Malcolm and his new friends rush to the second island to rescue his girlfriend. However at the same time, other visitors manage to disturb the poor sleeping T-Rex and his Raptor friends, thus creating a feeding frenzy on the island. The one thing I did enjoy about the movie were the special effects. They were outstanding!"
1,"AOL, (Aliens On Line)","Let me guess, they are running AOL (Aliens On Line)If you go to her website (S), all you see are aliens, aliens and aliens + plus reptiles etc., aka, Junk in the trunk. I see more things in reference to Satan then of God. There is not one thing listed how to come to the Lord Jesus Christ, lifting up His name and become saved and how to know our Savior. Prophet? I don't think so, we see from the Bible what is a ""True"" prophet which she falls very short of. She is against Jews and Jesus was a Jew. She also has the thinking of a White Supremist, pure racist.A person posted if your not a true Christian you should not read this book,I say again, if you have any wisdom God gave you, read the Bible God's Word, not Sherry Shriner. God tells you what you need to know to get saved and that is through Jesus Christ and no demon or alien invasion can steal you from the hand of the Lord. Jesus said we will have trials but to trust in Him."
2,Almost a Work of Fiction,"This book is entertaining, but almost completely void of fact. Woods doesn't even get how Gein was arrested correct. His imaginary dialogs between Gein, his mother and friends are written with a out of place southern drawl. If Woods did his research, he'd know that people from the upper Midwest (which includes myself) talk like in the movie Fargo. I credit Woods on writing about the pop culture phenomenon of Ed Gein, but that is about it. An almost complete waste of paper."
2,Good for a while ...,"I have had my tea thermos for about a year. It worked fine for the first 6 months or so, but after being in storage for the summer months, it developed tiny cracks all over. It was just sitting in a kitchen cabinet. If I squeeze it slightly, I hear cracking noises, which leads me to believe that the thermos is not very stable, and possibly now dangerous to use because of the plastic chemicals leaching out. I believe this company now makes a glass thermos, that might work better."
5,Works like a charm,"This product is wonderful. I bought it to use at work. It makes using loose leaf tea less complicated. Just add tea leaves, hot water, let steep and pour into a cup and drink."
5,Great Movie,My kids are fans of both Myscene and Bratz... They were begging me to buy this movie when it came out just as they begged me to by the new Bratz movie.Kids on this site..... It is okay to agree to disagree. And what I mean is- not everyone will like Myscene and not everyone will like Bratz. It doesn't make them weird or different. You cannot force your opinion on anyone. Rememeber that not just in this situation but throughout life as well. I think that you all are very smart kids and respectful kids...Keep it that way.Peace
3,Fades fast.,"The smell is excellent. It smells very vanilla-y. I read that a lot of people get complements on this fragrance, but I don't see how this is possible. After about 5 minutes, the smell is nearly gone. It has no staying power at all."
3,Not as shown,"This is the older formula box and bottle but they send the new formula(which is not as good) just beware, if you are looking for the older formula don't get it from here."
1,Nothing like I thought it would be...,"After reading the rave reviews on this spray, I decided to give it a try. However, when I got the product and smelled it...I was disappointed right away. It smells nothing like the description and is VERY overpowering. I thought maybe I just had to warm up to it, so I sprayed it on each wrist and tried to keep it on all day. I lasted for a few hours and just could not take it anymore... at this point it gave me a horrible headache and when my boyfriend came home he asked what the ""weird smell"" was and looked disgusted... I had to take a shower to scrub it off for both of our sake! Bottom line: was very disappointed, will not order again, and will not recommend this to my friends."
4,awesome video,"i saw a preview of animusic on pbs. after looking it up, i decided to buy this and the sequel. it is visually amazing, and the music is pretty cool too. i put these on when i have people over as background music and something to watch that doesn't require a lot of attention! i highly reccomend these to anyone who truly enjoys music and/or graphic/computer art."
4,kids love it!,"We saw a demo of the video at a local Electronics store and my daughter loved it. It became her Christmas gift this year and she's already watched it a number of times. She recently put it on for her friends (bunch of 11 year olds) and they were all watching avidly, discussing whether the balls were being recycled through each video or if new ones kept being generated. A good investment!"
2,universal appeal minus one,"Each of the seven cuts on this DVD explore combos of imaginative robotic instruments playing interesting, if not memorable, music.Some of the instruments are ingenious, and you will certainly find favorite cuts that you will want to revisit. The problem I had with this video is the lack of continuity. Based on the reviews, I expected to be more drawn into the video. I hoped to be mesmerized for about an hour. Didn't happen! I highly recommend this video for those of short attention-span."
2,Meh...,I don't know what to say about this...it was interesting but not wowing by any standards. It was semi-enjoyable to watch with interesting graphics and the concept is novel too. But the music SUCKS and thats half the DVD right there. Recommend renting or borrowing from a friend. I wouldn't buy this DVD again.
2,Perfect for being unintentionally hilarious,"I will admit that a ton of work must go into doing the animation and syncing it up with music - but our local PBS station loves this stuff, yet it makes me laugh and smirk more than anything. The music is pretty painful, and the animations are kind of hokey.Babies might love this though. I'll give you that."
4,Great workout music,I love this to exercise to. It keeps me from being bored to death on the treadmill. I see another detail everytime I watch it!
4,KJV/NKJV PARALLEL BIBLE,"I appreciate Nelson putting this Bible out. I've been looking for one of these ever since the NKJV came out. It is great to make comparison between the KJV and the NKJV especially since the congregation I am a member of uses both in the public teaching and preaching. About the only thing I don't like about it is the very small print. I would have been willing to pay a little more and make do with a larger Bible if the print would have been bigger. I would also like to have the option of buying a genuine leather Bible. This one is bonded leather. Anyway, all in all I'm very satisfied with this Bible."
5,Works great,Restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color! Also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle. A great investment that'll last quite a long time.
4,Bang for the Buck,"I bought this camera when LogiTech had a $20 rebate in effect. This made it the most feature filled camera that I could find for the money. Image quality is acceptable, but not great. Camera is very easy to install and configure. Big Plus.Unit went out and had to be replaced after three weeks of use. These things happen.Found the LogiTech Support less than helpful when the unit went out. Fortunately, there was a good return \ exchange policy on the camera."
4,Given as gift - they can't wait to go camping again,"I got this as a gift for my mom and dad, who own an RV. My mom looked through the recipes and commented on how they looked very easy and contained few ingredients -- perfect for on the road cooking."
1,HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT,"People who like this book have to be the author's friends. This so called novel is all about the stream of consciousness, sub-consciousness, unconsciousness of a very boring man. Knowing something about the author, this professor of Indian studies has to be his alter-ego. You are always inside his head, there are no real characters, no dialogue, and no atmosphere. The ideas are half-baked, the narrative is repetitious. No wonder it's published by an academic press."
4,Get over yourself,"Lee Siegel's ""Love in a Dead Language"" is an academic comic novel that is not for everyone. Especially for academics who take themselves so seriously that they would not consider including their own real names in their scathing negative reviews. I don't think anyone will read every word of it, and there's something to offend everyone. Nevertheless, I laughed out loud several times while reading it. One dreadful term paper and some pages from a fantasy web site on the Kamasutra are worth the price of the book."
5,*reply to 'grandma',"*actually the compass booster seat (B500) fits children 30-100 lbs who are 38"" to 57"" tall.... about 3-10 yrs old according to their website.i bought this seat when my daughter was 3 and love it! we travel quite a bit so its been helpful going through airports and getting in and out of cars/taxis. it also cleans up really nice and looks comfortable for my now 5 year old daughter. great booster seat!!!"
4,Overall Great Booster,"I bought this booster because of the padding in the seat. We travel frequently long distances and wanted it to be comfortable. My daughter does say it is comfy and loves the cup holders for her drinks and toys. However, when she falls asleep her head flops around, as others had stated also. That is the only negative that I have found and do not think it will be a problem on a day to day basis. The easy fold feature is fantastic. The cup holders are great. The seat seems to be comfortable and the way the entire back is supported when it is expanded is excellent. The only drawback seems to be the lack of support for sleeping children and their little heads."
3,It was okay.,I wish that Gaia and Sam should just hook up! I mean he loves her and she is interested in him so they should hook up. And this book could've been better. I just can't wait for ten to come out!
1,Not a good book,"This book actually upset me. It wasn't worth it. I really liked Pascal's earlier Fearless books, but this one is not good at all. I didn't like the graphic sex details - this is supposed to be a Young Adult series, not a Harlequin. And the Sam drinking/sex subplot made me wretch. With the next book, I think I'll just wait until it gets marked down before I buy it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Dead Empress divestiture.Miles gets sent to the boring duty of going to an Imperial funeral. Some people would also be happy if he didn't come back, of course, given he has been sent to Cetaganda. Miles of course manages to get involved with a mystery into the bargain, helping out one of the local military, and eve gets a medal for his trouble. A medal from this bunch doesn't really endear him to the locals much, either."
4,Miles gets Manners?,"This was the first Miles Vorkosigan adventure I read. I enjoyed it enough to purchase it and most of the series to date! An excellent and entertaining way to spend an afternoon or evening, Miles' impulses get him embroiled in murder and galactic problems that only his hyperactive mind can resolve. Ivan's character is more fully developed in this novel. While the novel stands alone in an enjoyable fashion, some of the little jokes are more understandable when you know about the Dendarii mercenaries from other books. I personally love reading the series from start to finish in order of Miles life, not necessarily publication order."
1,can you say 'rip off'?,"These bulbs, while illuminating street signs and reflective surfaces at greater distances than your standard bulb (which is useless, by the way, because those are not the obstacles you are trying to avoid in darker environments), are probably the biggest waste of money out in the automotive market. They are rated to work for as long as '2000 hours,' but really they mean 200 hours. I bought my first set in April; when my passenger side burned out 3 months later, I had assumed it was a fluke and bought a second pair. When my drivers side bulb burned out a month later, I was pissed (especially since the original lights had lasted more than 3 years).I would not buy these 'High Performance'-type bulbs again. I would heavily recommend against buying these bulbs. I will never buy a Sylvania light bulb so long as I live.Note: I would give this 0 stars, but that isn't an acceptable rating so I was forced to acknowledge this P.O.S. product with a '1 star.'"
1,Burns out quickly,Both bulbs burned out in exactly 12 months. The OEM bulbs lasted 8 years. Every car I have ever owned had bulbs lasting more than 12 months. I'd find another brand.
2,Lasted less than a years,I installed 2 of these headlight light bulbs and both burned out in less than one year. One actually only lasted about 3 months. The other was 11 months.
3,Average at best,"Overall the machine is decent for the price. You get what you pay for, but I bought this elliptical last September and within two months on of the wheels completely fell apart. I am well below the weight capacity for this machine so I wasn't really sure how this happened, but the company sent me two replacement wheels because parts and labor was still under warranty. Since then that part of the warranty has expired (its only 90 days) and I have now gone through four wheels on this machine and at the price of $18 a piece. To me that is a little too much to charge for a replacement wheel. This is the only real problem I've had with the machine. So if you don't mind replacing the wheels every 2 to 3 months than this is your machine."
3,It's funny and cute,"My boys love the pictures ~~ and I enjoyed reading the story about Arthur's first sleepovers and his little sister's concern about aliens. After a trick goes bad, Arthur returns the favor to his little sister. And it's just cute.It's a great book for beginners. If you're a mom of toddlers, this book is just cute to read ~~ it's not repetitive nor boring. It's a fun book.1-12-04"
1,Disgusted,"I have read behind many fiction writers and it disgusts me when one will write and not follow according to scripture. When a writer deals with biblical teachings or history, it is a lie if they do not re[present the truth to the fullest. According to Genesis, it was Moses who spoke to Pharoah and nmot Aaron."
4,Wow this is nice,"This is a great saw. I have been using it for about 6 months now. It was an upgrade form a Craftsman. Nice and heavy, quite, little vibration, and lots of power. I can slice through 8/4 oak with no hesitation. I use a Freud thin kerf 40T blade.Two drawbacks. The fence seems a little tight to the rail. I looks like it would have slide fine, until it was powder coated and the pait built up just a little to much. The second is that I wish the blade would lower a little more. When making zero insert blade inserts the blade does not lower enough to set the insert in firmly and raise into the insert. I may just need to adjust something.All in all it is a fantastic saw."
4,This book is a must for all anesthesiology residents.,"Every anesthesiology resident should run, not walk, to purchase this book. It is concise, very readable, and can be used as the primary reference for the cardiac anesthesia rotations. To date I have yet to find a significant omission. Do your self a favor and buy this book!"
2,good but unreadable,"Great book, a lot of information, but i'm sorry, unreadable. The presentation is like the old 80's book. No color, no space, that's pitty. That's why I bought the Kaplan's one, the short one (essentials of cardiac anesthesia) which is much more user friendly an fully colored. I recommend the last one if you want to buy a book about cardiac anesthesia, ideal for clinicians. Don't waist your time, go to the essentials without missing anything!!"
3,A little too basic,"I bought this book nine years ago, when I was a second-year teacher looking for teaching/learning activities that would enhance my students' learning in ninth grade English. Unfortunately, I finally had to give my copy to a special education teacher, because it was too basic for my ninth graders, year after year. The activities rarely took over two minutes. A cost/benefit analysis resulted in my opinion that the cost of reproducing the activities overwhelmed the limited benefit my students would get out of it (basically, an easy A paper). I think this book would be better targeted toward the upper elementary grades, rather than 7-12."
3,Single Use?,"I bought these because I thought they were single use petals, but the soap does not breakdown/foam fast enough and so you really have to work it to get the entire petal to foam up. Also, the petal may just break apart and you get bits of soap in the sink or drain, not good."
5,Best Brenda Novak yet!!,I really like all of the books written by Brenda Novak. She puts such detail and thought into her plots and characters. This is by far the best book to date. She has a way of creating just the right amount of sexual tension between the characters. I read in one day. I definately give it 5 stars.
5,An Excellent Incite into the Dynamics of The Who,Not only do you get to know the greatest basist of all time but you also learn of his interpersonal relationships with the origional members of The Who and the chemistry that bonded them.
3,A nice visit with an old friend.,"First, I'll cut to the chase - I'd buy this again. The show was well worth watching. Nothing really new, but it is nice to have a DVD that is about John, not about The Who with bits about John. It contains nice interviews with his son and others. A few good shorts of John with his band, and although he looks ill in his interviews, that is one of the high 'bits' as it were - he never shows regrets, but he sure seems to have enjoyed the ride."
1,Garbage,"I bought this cover to keep my bike protected from humid, rainy San Francisco weather. First night I put it on, it fit over the bike well enough, I fastened the hooks and otherwise made sure my Harley Sportster was covered nice and snug. I come to take the cover off the next morning and lo and behold, the bike is soaking wet. I was like WTF. So the next night I made extra sure the bike was properly covered and aligned to the body of the bike. Fastened the hooks once again and went to bed with fingers crossed. Come back the next morning and sure enough the bike is soaked. I don't get it. I closely examined the material, there's no holes or other defects that would explain why the bike got wet. Seems to me the answer is pretty simple, this piece of trash isn't waterproof.Fail."
4,great bike cover,this is a great cover for my motorcycle. the material is tough and great. i have had no problems with it.
5,The Best Ever.......,"It's out in the rain all spring and summer and does the job from handle bars to bottom of the tires, I bought it a size larger to ensure everything would be covered. Stong Winds, pelting rain, even a summer hail storm did nothing to dislodge this cover. Excellent!!!"
3,Use soapy water,I got this for my daughter and found that it did not work. I got a second one that worked at first and then stopped working when i took the demo plastic insert out. I was so mad that it did not work. We even hooked up a power tester to it and it worked when we had it hooked up. So just to see if it would work i tried putting soapy water in it. That worked it has worked well ever since. The only problem is the suction cups dont work.
1,Absolute Junk,"My daughter loves bath time and fish -- so I thought how perfect is this toy! And like all the other reviews of this toy, ours didn't work either. In the begining, it intermittently worked at best, then quit working all together except at night when no water was present and the toy was left on. If you are looking to buy this toy -- take your money elsewhere."
2,Doesn't work as described,"I should have known since the boxes for all three in the store were kind of beat up, that they'd probably been returned, and after reading these reviews I think for sure that is the case. So, Toys 'R' Us puts them back on the shelf when people return them as defective??? The thing doesn't stay on the wall very good, and it has two settings which seem to work the same - continuous music with no change when you pour into the cups - NOT AS DESCRIBED on the box. Guess I will look for the receipt and take it back to the store. I was hoping it would keep my 7-month-old great nephew from standing up in the tub!"
1,Not worth it!,I got my 1 year old this toy and I hate it. You hardly hear the music & it plays only when it wants to. I should have spent my money on something better.
1,Too bad!,"Such a great idea! Too bad it never worked consistently, and eventually not at all. It got to a point after being used maybe 10 times tops, that I would have to flip the switch off and then on again to get it to work. And when it did, it would play one time and then have to be turned off and on again. AND only one of the little instuments worked at that point. I hoped it was a battery problem - no such luck! Too bad!!"
5,I love Scooter,This just might be the best CD ever. I've never met Scooter but the CD makes me feel like I know him...It's kinda weird but it's a good feeling. He expresses himself so well that I feel like I've known him forever.
5,Ancient Rituals,My wife Lydia and I bought a copy of the CD at Scooter's Release Party and it's hard to find the words to describe this debut CD. Fantastic seems to be an understatement! Talent seems to pour from every word and every note and the songs seem to stay with you long after the CD is over. Our seven year old's music groups just found their competition. My favorites just got added to also! John Scudieri's Ancient Rituals is a MUST HAVE for everyones collection!
1,Laughably Bad!,"There isn't a word in the English language to describe just how absolutely terrible this album is. I don't know which is funnier -- this so-called attempt at music, or the artist's shameless self-promotion on this website by obviously having friends post ""good"" reviews of it."
1,one computer! one user!,"This program seemed to be an excellent accounting system for my small business. I bought it, had an employee install it and just as we had all our business info transferred:our office computer crashed and burned. I attempted to reload on another computer and continue business as usual. QuickBooks pro 2001 reloaded on the new computer but since it had already been registered it stops after 15 uses. The company informs me that each unit is for 1 user and 1 computer. I have no idea how well the system works but if your computer dies Pro 2001 dies with it!!"
4,Friendly User,"I have used Quickbooks since 1996.Very good programm, but it needs some improvements in payroll. 1.The programm does not print State Tax ID # on W-3. 2.The programm does not print Form 1096 at all. 3.The programm does not support and print California Tax forms DE-6 and DE-7 (sorry, but I live and work in California). 4.Unlike in Quiken (which is by the way Excellent program) I can not recategorise accounts). I hope my opinion can halp"
3,Quickbooks help line,I purchased the Quickbooks 1 year help contract via telephone. I thought it was a good deal until I found out that all calls to the help line are long distance. Also when calling in you are usally put on hold. This becomes quit expensive as I have already spent (...) for the service to begin with. One would think that the help line would be a toll free call. (or is this a way to limit calls and employee hiring) The yearly contract is no bargain when you add up the cost of long distance calls added to the origional price of the package.
2,Designer Protein Lacking Chocolate Flavor!,"I purchased a 12.7 ounce can of Designer Protein Supplement, Chocolate Powder at a local store. I'm glad it was only a small can. While I can't comment on the quality of the protein (how can anyone tell???), I can say that the chocolate favor was weak, with a bit of an after-taste. OK, I'm a chocoholic, but there was little if any chocolate taste to this powder. I've used a few others that certainly taste better, and cost no more."
5,"Great, mixing depends on flavor","I've been using this protein for several months and have tried French Vanilla, Chocolate, and Double Chocolate. The chocolate flavor is the most easily mixed and tastes great when added to cereal in the morning - remember cocoa-rice cereal and how the milk turns chocolaty? It ends up like that. The vanilla is slightly less mixable and is great in home-made frozen fruit smoothies, made with a hand blender (I'm going to try the strawberry flavor for smoothies with my next purchase). The double chocolate is very similar to the plain chocolate flavor except for two things: it is made with stevia which is nice, but it is very difficult to mix/dissolve in milk; so not as good in cereal. All flavors were tasty, high in protein and low in calories - excellent."
3,not impressed.,"much thicker than i'd like in a bathing suit and the cross-straps are hard as hell to adjust on your own. on more than one occasion, i've had to have someone straighten them out for me as they twist a ton, especially when putting it on."
4,Nice sander,"I upgraded from the 16/32 model. Esentially this is the same sander only bigger. The one feature they added that is nice is the sandsmart spped control. Instead of the motor shutting off and having to be reset like on the 16/32, this machine will automatically slow the conveyor belt down if you try to take too much off at one time.Items were shipped in two seperate boxes and shipping company lost the bigger of the two boxes but eventually all arrived.Very easy to assemble- just make sure you have a good dust collection system.DaveTexasthunder Woodworks"
1,Never received complete product,"Attempted to buy this item twice, each time was only sent the bottom feed table and not the motor. Can not review the product because i have never receive a complete sander. after two months of waiting, i finely cancelled the order and went else where."
1,save your money...,"I ordered these on a uTube recommendation and that proved to be a mistake. The picks are made from a thinner than usual plastic and the thumb area does NOT hold the pick in place (on your thumb). On top of that, the 3 picks, in the package, are nested inside each other so when you pull them apart only the inner-most pick is even a ""medium"" size. The other 2 are stretched out from being slipped over each other and are useless! I would NOT recommend these to anyone."
4,Great Book But Not a Lawyer Replacement in Many Cases,"This is a wonderful, accurate book, but is thin on actual statutory and case law and document lists. It could only be a lawyer-replacement in the most straightforward cases. Absolutely get the book to understand the process and be a better help to your lawyer, as well as to make sure your lawyer is giving you good advice, but unless your case is very clear-cut, consult a lawyer, as well.Also know that, for asylum and VAWA applicants, there are literally hundreds of organizations that provide free or very low-cost services, so if you're in that situation, and your resources are limited, getting your much-needed legal representation in these cases is affordable."
2,Very disappointed,"I have a 2.5 year old non-verbal daughter. Recently she fell and broke her leg so we decided to get her this DVD so she would have something new and fun while she couldn't get around. She wasn't that interested and the signs it was teaching weren't that useful. The ""Signing Time"" series is so much better."
2,There are better DVD's out there,"If you really want your child to learn sign language, this is not the greatest DVD. The ""My Baby Can Talk"" series is better (no, I don't work for them.)This BE DVD goes too fast to teach little ones signs, and is boring for both me and my little one! There's also ""Baby Signing Time"" (good but annoying songs, however the little guy likes it) and ""Talking Hands"" (looks a bit dated but has the best pace for learning).Wouldn''t buy this DVD again had I previewed it first."
3,"Good dvd, very slow shipping","I ordered several dvd's at the same time and this one arrived two weeks later than the rest.My toddler loves this show, but seems to get tired of it quicker than he does some of the other baby einstein dvds."
2,Worst BE we own,"My son, husband, and I really do not like this DVD because (unlike other Baby Einstein DVDs) this DVD is too focused on cheap looking computer animation. There are very few puppet scenes, and the ones they have are pretty quick and lack much depth. The music is pretty bad, too. I prefer the music of Baby Mozart or Baby Beethoven. This sounded synthetic and computer-generated, not ""real."" I found this DVD to be boring and couldn't keep my attention or that of my son. My son (15 months) can't watch this entire DVD. He gets very bored and sick of the monotonous sign language instructions (which take up most of the DVD and are pretty fast in pace). I was underwhelmed and wish I hadn't purchased this DVD. It is not like previous BE DVDs. I suggest Baby McDonald, Baby Da Vinci, or Baby Mozart to those who wish to purchase a BE DVD."
2,"Not against signing, of course, but video is boring","I have to add my voice to those who have written that this is one boring video. Our 20-month old enjoys BE videos, and usually asks to watch one before bedtime each night. Baby MacDonald is his favorite, with Baby Mozart a close second, and Baby Beethoven and Baby Van Gogh tied for third.This video held his attention for oh, about 5 minutes! It's NOT because of the signing, not at all. Rather, the animation is very boring, there is very limited puppetry, and it's very slow paced.I'd recommend lots of other videos in this series, just not this one very enthusiastically."
5,Improved Communication!,My daughter has always loved BE videos. I was excited when this one came out because she is speech impaired. I had already taught her some basic signs but this video (and all the other BE videos with sign) helped her gain some new signs and a new confidence in communication. Once my daughter learns a sign she soon tries to speak the word as well. We are now teaching my son signs even though he shows no impairment in speech. I would recomend any BE video and encourage parents to try signing with their children sppech impaired or not.
1,Dangerous lack of Biblical truths,"This book has a big lack of Holy Scriptures and is based on man's psychology views instead of God's views. We need to be fighting for the truth of the LORD and the Gospel, instead of focusing on making ourselves feel good about ourselves. If you want a book that really challenges you to fight for Truth and our Lord, please read ""The Bravehearted Gospel"" by Eric Ludy. A much more God-focused book that is filled with wisdom and based on the Bible."
2,Insightful but ...,"Without question this book is easy for us men to relate to. So much of what Mr. Eldredge says challenges me to be a better husband, father, and leader in general. Dissapointing to me was all of the references to ""Man Movies."" I was a little uncomfortable with so much allusion to the world's models of manhood and so little communication of the Biblical model for men. I am sure that Jesus Christ should not be compared with William Wallace, Maxximus, or James Bond, etc. If we can't look at the Word of God and get a clear picture of God's expectation for men, then where can we really look? Read the book. Take all that is good from it. But look into God's Word to find out what makes a real man."
5,Great Book,This book offers a great insight on why you act the way you do. It makes you think and realize things you may have never realized about yourself before.
5,Inspiring and Provoking,"John Eldredge has written the most profound book on explaining the heart of a man. His book touched me in that I found someone who has expressed so clearly the thoughts and feelings that most men have not been able to express. I began reading this on an airplane, and didn't want the plane to land to give me more time to read. This is a book that not only is inspirational for men, but a book that wives and mothers should read about the men in their lives. Eldredge's book set me on fire and encouraged me in a way that no book that I have read recently has been able to do. Once you've found your heart in the way that this book describes, your in for a life-changing experience. You can't read this book without experiencing an impact beyond description."
4,Wild at Heart and Soul!,"I just read another book for my book review blog - Wild at Heart by John Eldridge. I know what you're thinking - Mandy, you're not a man! Isn't that a man's book? Well, the answer is yes and no. I thought it would be a good read, and I had heard a lot about it so I decided to check it out. It was a great book! I tend to devour books, but this one I read a chapter at a time and felt completely satisfied. It was a highly interesting look into the brain and hard wiring of the male christian mind. I recognized traits of myself in the book, just as a child of God, and I recognized traits and tendencies of all of the men in my life as well. It taught me that it's okay to be a little wild and uncut sometimes - that God made us all to be exactly who he made us to be, and it's okay to play to our strengths and be ourselves! I recommend this book not just for any man, but for anybody who is interested in learning more about those that God man in his own image - human beings!"
3,Wild at Heart Book Review,"This is a great book for any man that seems to be stuck in a rut and just going through the motions of life. This is also a great book for women to know exactly why men are the way they are in their desire for the ""wild"". Why do boys fight? Why do men have that passion in their hearts for the outdoors? Why did God make men in a way to continue to desire the unexpected? After 10 years and millions of copies sold, men are continuing to need this book to know exactly how to get that fire and passion back into their hearts."
5,Fabulous Book!,I read this book on a referral from someone and found it to be something of a life saver. It spoke to me in ways that no other book had in the past. I could relate to many of the situations and really appreciate all the insight that John provided. I believe it will make me a better husband and father. Mostly because it provided me with some explanation of why I felt like it did.Every man should read this book.
5,Changed my Life,"Without exaggeration, this is one of the most important books I've ever read. It gave me permission to be a man. Does that sound odd? You need to read it. You'll understand. The American culture does not put forth an honest picture of authentic manhood; neither does the church. John has hit the nail on the head. I was trying to be, what he calls, a ""nice guy,"" not a real Christian man. Read this. You will be better for it."
1,This book sucks. Period.,"First, I'm not a Christian. I've heard good things about this book from Christian friends. And I must confess, I'm only halfway through the book. The first ten pages were GREAT. He really draws you in, and points out some real, logical problems with men. But it seems like he takes those first ten pages and re-words them for the next 100. I'm so bored with this book I could almost puke."
1,Poor excuse for a Christian book!,"""What has happened the Christian community?? This is one of the worst books I've read. Right from the start Eldredge claims that Bible Study is boring. That has not been my experience when learning about our God! Then he goes on to say that God called an evil infested creation ""Good"". Eldredge has created for himself a god that is different than the God of the Bible. God called His creation ""Good"" BEFORE sin entered. The ""wildness"" that Eldredge relishes is a result of sin. Next he completely denies the Omniscience of God. To state that ""God took a risk"" is to imply that God does not know the outcome. That is a denial of the God of the Bible. I'm greatly saddened by the popularity of this book! I'm greatly saddened by the state of God's people if they can't discern the poor theology of this book. It doesn't belong on Christian bookstore shelves."""
1,This book is truly frightening.,"It often seems on Amazon that favorable reviews are ""helpful"" and unfavorable reviews are not. Nonetheless, what is frightening to me is that Christians have become so completely fuzzy about what the Bible says and what good, sound teaching really is. This book appeals to the worst about human beings. Were it not so tragic, it would be laughable. Eldridge yanks scripture out of context, ignores scripture that negates his statements, makes heretical statements about the nature of God and generally makes a mockery of sound scholarship. Men all look like cutouts from the same mold, as do women. I am a woman who does not fit his preconceived ideas...but I was also insulted for the men in my life. I am appalled, and yes I am frightened, that some well-known teachers and writers have endorsed this book."
2,Simplistic and one-dimensional,"Eldridge's attempt to revitalize Christian masculinity is well intentioned, and I cannot deny the obvious passion with which he writes. In many men Eldridge rekindles the fire for God that has been smothered in our current culture.However, his concept of ""wild"" masculinity fails to go beyond the Braveheart, sword-wielding, strap-a-machine-gun-to-my-Hummer-and-take-off-for-a-weekend-into-the-mountains-hunting-cougars view of masculinity.His point is this: Live passionately. What he says, however, does not encourage spiritual growth among men as much as it tries to bring us back to our caveman roots. For a more balanced look at Masculine Spirituality, try Arnold's ""Wildmen, Warriors, and Kings."""
3,Good Points,"After hearing so many good things about the book from all the men in my church and my school I was so excited to get the book. I started on it the first day I got it. Eldredge makes several good points but his overall message is confusing. In my understanding he wants men to be wild? He also uses the Message as his text, a contravercial text."
1,What a Load Of Crap,"It's really sad that a topic with so much promise has been handled by such a poor writer. It seems as if this book was hastily assembled from a collection of random thoughts without any structure or purpose. By mentioning God and quoting bible verses the author hides behind the shield that gives all good christians protection from criticism justly deserved in this case. What a load of crap. If you think this book is great then buddy, you got problems."
1,Strong on Movie References....not Bible References,"I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book because I have been struggling with what the Bible truly says about how to be a good husband, father, and man in general. I often see people confusing the role of the man with what society says and was looking for a good Biblical viewpoint on it. After reading Eldredge's book, I was left disappointed. I felt that he was writing from a soapbox more than from experience and research. I didn't actually go back and count but it certainly felt like he referenced movies more than he did the Bible. Finally, while he tried to be balanced in his description of men, his descriptions came out more stereotyped as those guys that like to hunt, camp, wrestle, etc.Overall, I do think that this book could be good for many men and women out there, but not for those looking for a Biblical perspective on what it means to be a man."
3,???,"This book is for those faint-hearted, self-centered American Christian men who are spoiled by the comforts of this world. It is an imperfect gift God has used to help us get a little closer to Him, hopefully. However, if we believe we have found the purpose and fulfilment of our life after reading this book, we are deadly wrong. Keep seeking. The hearts and minds of many of us are so conditioned (brainwashed) by the current culture and the education we received that it is almost impossible for us to read anything deeper than this book. Hopefully our hearts can be opened up a little more so that we are ready to receive and be consumed by God's real Gift for us."
4,A biography of a man's soul,"I first read Wild at Heart about 6 years ago, and it deeply affected my life as a teenager, trying to figure out manhood and what it meant to really be a man of God. This book brought back memories of the first time I read it, in a nicer presentation, and some newer and updated content revisions. It really takes an in-depth look at the emotions (yes, men do have them) and energies that drive a man to do what he does - I felt like I was reading a biography of my soul. Love this book, and have given several copies away to other young men of the faith that I do life with."
5,This is a must for all men!,This book is so amazing. Its a must read for every man. I even recommend the womans book called Captivating. Excellent. Excellent.
4,Wild At Heart,"The product (the book Wild At Heart) was delivered within a fews and in great condition. As for the book itself, I'm still reading it for my small church group. When purchasing in the future, I have no problem utilizing Amazon.com.Wild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's SoulRegards,Bobby"
1,I don't want to grow up,"This poor man is unable to act as a mature man would, an has managed to blame it on God."
5,One of the most important books I've ever read,"I purchased this book at a time in my life when I was seriously questioning God, my relationship with my father, and my role as a man. I read it all the way through in about a day; I find myself, three weeks later, referring to it on a daily basis. I appreciate Eldredge's candidness and boldness in writing this book. It has opened my heart to God the Father and has helped bring me to a point where I am content being a child of God. If you are in a position where you are questioning what it REALLY means to be a godly man, I encourage you to check this book out. Don't write it off as being ""just another Christian man's book."" It's so much more than that!"
1,Nicely packaged heresy,"The thesis of this book is ""God is a risktaker (he took a risk on you after all, so you should be a risktaker too"". So the very thesis and driving principle of the book is heresy, based on a complete misunderstanding of God and denial of omnipotence and omniscience. This is the horrible doctrine of Open Theism packaged with well written prose, to try to sucker in the common Christian to believe a God-diminishing lie. Avoid!"
3,Wild at Heart: Not just for men!,"I recently read _Wild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soul_. I had been wanting to read this book for a while simply because it's by John Eldredge. His wife Staci co-authored _Captivating_ with him and that, in my opinion is one of the best books I have ever read. It was an enlightening read. With that said, I opened the first few pages of _Wild at Heart_ and was introduced to the world of men and the struggles they face. Eldredge does a great job at introducing the struggles of a man not just to readers who may be men, but also to women. This book can be very easily read and understood by both genders.I walked away with a greater understanding of the struggles men face and came to better appreciate the men in my life. While I am still single and I have no children, I would encourage women who are mothers to young sons to read this book. I think the contents that lie within the pages of _Wild at Heart_ would be a great resource to them."
4,Wild at Heart,"I recently re-read this book, Wild at Heart, by John Eldridge. The version I received from [...] (Thomas Nelson Publishers) for free was an ""updated"" version. I was hoping for something a bit different - but it was just the same content. Over the years this book has been widely acclaimed and widely criticized. I agree with a lot of what Eldridge says - I appreciate the link he presses into regarding God and creation. It is easy to appreciate and stand in awe of that link when living in a beautiful place such as Bozeman. The first 25% of this book is wonderful! After that, it seems like he repeats himself over and over again. Like a large number of Christian books out there, this one could have been more concise, to the point, and less repetitive. That being said, if you haven't yet read this one - you should."
5,Personally relevant,Best book I've ever read. A book about men for men (and women) that had me slowing down the more I read just to digest and think. John's writing is easily read and very insightful. I am checking out his entire library.
1,Apostasy at its worst,"This book is so rife with doctrinal innacuracies, that it boggles the mind. Instead of focusing all of ourselves on Jesus, the author writes this book to boost ourselves up and at one point almost advocates open theism. If everyone who reads these kinds of books, or any books for that matter, would do as God directed and analyze everything against the scriptures, we would be better off and not so easily distracted by false doctrines."
3,All Men are wounded...,"... At some point in their lives.The author confessess that he was deeply wounded ""Between Years 8 and 10""How he doesn`t say. The book says mostmen turn to women to heal their wounds. Women can`t heal our wounds; forthey carry wounds as well. In fact If you seen a ""chick flick""most women deal with their wounds by,Intentionally infilicting wounds on men. Only GOD can heal our wounds!"
3,Question for those who like this book:,"Before I write a review of this book (I've read it twice now...for reasons I'll share later), I'd like to ask those who like this book to answer this question: What ACTION have you personally taken as a result of reading this book?Hope to hear from many of you.bobandjudyhm@hotmail.com"
5,Great Understanding of what a real man is,John has untapped the secrets of a man's soul and leads you to expereince the truth of what it means to be a man and a woman. He is a gifted writer that helps understand why boys are boys and girls are girls without authenitcating the abuse that both have suffered from men that were not truly men. In my own journey to understand what a man is and how to raise my sons to be men I have not found a more helpful or insightful book.
4,Informative,"This book was very informative. If you go to this book looking for an easy answer to all the questions rought up in the Da Vinci Code, you will be let down. The book is riddled with quotes from early church fathers and ancient Gnostic ""gospels"". I really enjoyed this but it contains a lot of info and can be boring if you are not too interested in the topic. This is the best book that talks of the Davinci Code!"
4,"Better video quality, but the band started to waver...","The top of the world is where KISS sat during the first part of this collection. They were on every K-tel release in the late 70s...and then the whiplash happened and people ran away from the band, leaving just us hardcore fans to watch as the group fractured.The band is slick...packaged...and too clean. Paul starts what I refer to as his intro Yodels. I think the song ""Heavens on Fire"" stuck in his throat and he starts trying to sing instead of talk in between songs. This collection is a study in a band's evolution...or De-evolution if you don't care for the way the band changed."
3,Too Many Years and Sorely Lacking,"Missing from this set is:A complete concert from the 10th Anniversary (Creatures of the Night) tour.A complete concert from the Lick It Up tour.A complete concert from the Animalize Tour (this was already released as Animalize Live and Uncensored but a restored DVD of a great recording would be nice).A complete concert from the Asylum Tour (huge dissapointment here).The ultimate KISS DVD set should have a complete concert from every tour IMO. The fact that I have to go to WalMart to get the Dynasty tour on DVD via a bonus disk is a little dissapointing as well. But, that and the Fridays performance are the core reasons I will be buying KISSOLOGY Volume II."
2,MORE LICK IT UP AND ANIMALIZE PLEASE!,"I was disappointed to see the portion of the video that should have had the lick it up and animalize material was pretty much left out.These two albums above mentioned were awesome fallow ups to themake up days.A lot of new fans were introduced to kiss during this era that weren't around for the make up days.True kiss and Vinny Vincent didn't have the best relationship, howeverthe fans still deserve to see the footage!History is still Kisstory and you can't change that.If you want awesome make up with rock n roll the way it should have been recorded get volume 1."
3,Kissology 2 ...to be continued?,"I have to say that I am extremely disappointed that the Tom Snyder interview and the Largo show were cut. If it can't fit on one disc, make it a four disc set. What are we paying for previews? Not only should the Tom Snyder interview be complete, but there should have been more footage of the original members on there from 78 that people HAVE NOT seen. Kissology 2 focuses more on the 80s and 90's than it does the 70's. I really don't mean to have such a negative review, but I have to be honest and it's just my opinion as a fan of the original members of KISS. Others may or may not feel the same way."
4,very good kiss rockin. on dvd.,"Where's mark st johns? (rip) they needed to provide one song at least on here with him playing! That was a serious ommission for the band. Sure he wasn't around long but the late guitarist was part of the band and his presence isn't on here. Other than that I can say this set is first class. The band put alot of great songs on here from their 78-80's period and that is good enough to warrant buying this set. Kiss rocks and they are great and this set is while not a good as kissology one , it is still worth owning."
5,clear thinking of the Iyengar path,"Doing yoga is not just for the sake of doing the asanas, but a way of getting deeper in perfectioning the movement through being in a process of discovery your innerself soul and body. Who reads The Tree of Yoga will be able to understand better what I am trying to share with you."
3,it's required for teacher training,"Iyengar is a major yogi and it's nice to read his thoughts - but I only bought this as it is required reading for teacher training. I thought ""The Heart of Yoga"" explains the limbs of yoga in a way that is much more clear."
3,good headphone,I really like this headphone.It is easy to retract. You just need to insert the plug into the plug hold.
1,Does not work with Mac,"I bought this as an external backup for my Mac, and this drive is preformatted to run as a PC backup. While I have had no problem reformatting drives in the past to work with my Mac, this one had a fatal error when doing so. The reformatting worked fine and it was recognized by the Mac but moving any amount of data to it would cause everything to hang with no recourse but to kill the power. Nothing worked and the only thing this drive did was waste my time."
3,OK - but needs more diagrams.,"Do not buy this thinking it will help you technically plan a laparoscopic surgery. Although I wasn't expecting a true altas, I was expecting at least basic diagrams of recommended port placement for various procedures, basic steps including pitfalls, etc. This is more of a literature discussion / textbook approach. Not bad, and does complement my surgical library - but would have been much more helpful as a frequent reference if it had more graphics."
4,Mom of Yu-Gi-Oh Son,"The information in the book is fantastic and loads of it too. The book was not in new condition as listed in the advertisement. I was disappointed with this because it was a gift. Other than that, my son loves the book and he doesn't really care that it is a little worn."
4,Solid release from a great vocalist,"Being a huge Symphony X/Michael Romeo fan, I bought this cd to hear Michael Romeo's guitar work. As always Michael Romeo gives a stellar performance of mind-boggling, yet melodic, guitar wizardry. It is interesting to hear him in a more relaxed, standard time signature effort. His rhythm tone is a little lighter, but this is still some good stuff. The other guitarists are quite good too. Kotipelto gives a solid performance...I would put him in the same class as Mark Boals, but I think he is better. The songs are interesting and the supporting drums/bass/keys are impressive. Any fan of melodic metal would do well to have this in their collection. Fans of Michael Romeo/SyX should pick this up as well, although it is not on par with the epic stuff SyX puts out."
1,:(,i have not received this movie that i ordered sence 8/20/11 and now its been a month 9/22/11.i would like to know what is going on....or put back my money to my account again.
3,Cool!,"Slows down my 6'3 as a Set, Mobetta with Twin set up. Or if you use the trailer with a different set of fins..."
1,Stay Away from Quickbooks,"Payroll stops working if you do not agree to their monthly tax table update service. Im not cheap. I just dont think my accounting software should stop working if I don't pay every month. Documentation says it wont stop, but it does. I smell class action law suit. Dont put up with this extortion. Go elsewhere."
3,"Edited scenes, Yuk.","Colr and picture are good. The editing sucks big time. The scene in ""Fagin"" where Albert asked Ingals if he could call him Pa if edited. The scen in ""There's no place like home"", where Garvey loses his job is edited. All episodes are about 43.00 min. long.videoman"
4,Little House Season 5,Great Family watching. The sound quality is fair. Hard to hear in some spots. Picture quaility is great.
2,too much or too little,"I was tempted to give this 1 star, but I dont hate it so it got 2. This interpretation of the Qur'an has quite a bit of commentary for some iyahas the commentary is a page long (which I felt was kind of excessive). Some commentary states the same thing a previous comment states, and some commentary actually says ""No Text No Text No Text""... that was pretty disappointing. I think the book is in serious need of a proofreading so things like that dont make it to print. Also, the book refers to appendices that are not in the book, that was kind of upsetting.Book is paperback, and even though I am very careful with my books the lamination on the cover started to peel away from the edges a bit."
1,Not what I thought this cd would be!!!,"This cd was not what I thought it would be it's too country,I was looking for the usual R&B. Not happy at all!! Matter of fact I am giving this cd away."
4,Interesting and better than the first...,"Well, this book still has a religious element to it, but it wasn't quite as harsh as I found Sullivan's Law to be. My only real problem with it was when Carolyn at one point acted like women need men to be whole or complete. Aside from that, I did enjoy the story and found it more satisfying than the first in the series. There were a few weird errors that anyone who knows proper grammer should have caught if they read slowly enough, but it didn't really detract from anything for me aside from having to read a few sentences twice. If you enjoyed Sullivan's Law, give this one a try. As I said, if you can ignore or get past the religious element, it's a good story."
1,Dated and sad,"Yes this book was published in 1994 and it reflects that era in gay writing, but...man was it depressing. I'm very glad gay fiction has come a long way from these short stories, because to be honest only one was worth reading out of 20. Robert Rodi's 'Tricked' was hilarious. If it wasn't for his one good short, I would have been even more disappointed. Lesson learned, only buy new gay novels."
1,Improved sound is minimal,"The sound quality may be slightly better than usual, but it's not enough to warrant buying the same material again."
1,Don't pick this up,"I agree with the previous reviewers who said that this material has been put out time andtime again. If anyone is new tothe Burritos the place to startwould be the 2 disc HOT BURRITOSand the band's last cd, 99's greatSONS OF THE GOLDEN WEST. This disconly exposes the curious to thefirst two years of the band."
5,Amazing Jelly,This is the most amazing rose petal jelly I have ever eaten. I was first introduced to this Jelly at Harad's Tea Room in London and have been yearning for it ever since. I made a batch of scones and put this amazing jelly on them. They were delicious!!!!! This jelly is so good it is almost magical.
5,Third book in House of Winslow series,"Excellent from page one to the end! Adventure, romance, history's finest heroes all wrapped up into one great book. A must read!"
2,The music is nice but.....,There is hardly any singing in this one. I have bought the others and they are much better. This one seemed as if they were in a hurry in order to get it done.
5,Breathtaking!,"I had the immense good fortune to be gifted with this album for my birthday, and after listening to it, sought out and purchased ""Fairy Nightsongs"" as well. The music, all instrumental, is absolutely spellbinding. There is definately something magical about this one!"
1,Antichrist? or publicity stunt?,"This book was completely farfetched and an object of a publicity stunt. I do not recommend anyone buy this book. Instead of this book, why not buy a bible? You are looking for answers aren't you? I would look somewhere else other than this book!"
5,I loved it!,"This is the best romantic comedy I have ever seen! This is really a one to watch!This is a movie that really gives you a lovely love feeling inside of you! With the jazz music at the background, and showing the beautiful romantic side of New York makes this the most lovely romantic movie for me! (And of course Kate Beckinsale) The extras on the DVD are very good to give you an inside look of making the movie."
3,Two Very Attractive Stars in a Rather Dull Romantic Comedy,"I was disappointed in this film because I expected a lot of fizz with Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack, both favorites of mine. The plot has already been characterized as pretty farfetched and a bit [stupid], but if you can get by the basic premise that two people so strongly attracted to each other would go through so much foolishness solely to put obstacles in their way, then you may enjoy watching this film. The chemistry between Beckinsale and Cusack is there but because so much of the time is spent with them just missing each other, it really doesn't get off the ground as it should. However, the movie has its moments (some of them provided by Cusack real-life best friend Jeremy Piven) and overall is a relatively pleasant way to kill a couple of hours."
4,"Heartwarming, romantic movie","Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack are so enjoyable as fated lovers in this wonderful romantic comedy. Great supporting cast, fun twists and a general sense of ""aww!"" pervades the entire movie. It's one you'll want to purchase and watch over and over. Although the portrayal of New york in Christmas is sometimes questionable (i.e., girl walking down street in short sleeved shirt and scarf) it's a very cute look at fate and how sometimes we have to look at signs as more than a coincidence."
5,Always Wanted To See It,"I loved this movie when I first saw it on dvd a couple months ago. I wish I could've gotten to see it in the theater, but I'm glad I finally saw it and now own it. It's a must have for all you romantic people."
3,Love and Fate,"This is a romantic comedy, but the comedy does not stick with you. It is not that the movie is unfunny, but the laughs won't be remembered tomorrow; none of the humor is that memorable. Two people meet by chance and have a wonderful time together. Since they are seeing other people, they go their own ways and decide to leave their meeting again to the fates. Watching their separate paths inadvertently cross without their knowing is the main part of the movie. Pure serendipity!John Cusack is John Cusack. His character is similar to most of the good guy/dreamer-type characters he plays in many movies. John Corbett is funny as the boyfriend of Kate Beckinsale.I would recommend this if you are looking for a light-hearted romance, but not if you are looking for a comedy."
1,"Trite, Mean-Spirited, Disappointing","O Where Have You Gone, Lloyd Dobler?The message of this movie seems to be that you should do what you want, when you want with little or no concern for those who may get stepped on in the process. Zero chemistry between John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. You know a film is in trouble when the buddy-buddy antics between Cusack and Jeremy Piven can't save it. This is old, unoriginal stuff. The ""quotes and trivia"" section points out many links between this film and some of Cusack's other works. No wonder it seems so worn. This is a waste of the talents of Cusack, Piven, and Molly Shannon. If you're looking for a romantic comedy that explores the idea of serendipity, rent Sleepless in Seattle instead."
2,Good premise but too laborious,"When I read the review I thought it would be a great story. Both my wife and I liked the idea of the story but we both thought there were too many twists and turns. For a short movie it took a long time to get there and my wife kept going to sleep during the movie. The acting was okay, especially the store salesman (I've seem him in a recent movie playing a similar character but can't remember where). This one was a free rental so I got my money's worth. I was not disappointed that the cubed scene was deleted but I thought the original opening was better than the one they used. If you are thinking of renting this movie, rent 'Sabrina' instead. This review was based on the DVD."
1,"I own the movie, but it is masochistic to watch it.","Why do I watch it when the enormous amount of outright stupidity makes me crazy. (Name any scene with Sarah in it, and it is maddeningly stupid). The psycho chick lead - is a therapist who proves the hypothesis that only truly sick people enter that profession. (I don't happen to believe this). She is nuts. She completely screws her best friend, and, sadly, her friend doesn't walk out of her life forever.The supporting actors are wonderful. Cusak is fine, but you have to loathe his character for falling for psycho-woman -- and why not? She is thin and she has a British accent.Why did they do this to us? Was the original script okay, but got skewered by a demented series of editors, producers and directors?I don't even want to donate this film to a thrift store because the unfortunate person who buys it would probably find me and sue me. Bleah!"
3,The story just doesn't grab ya,"For those of you who read Lucky in Love, you will be disappointed with the third book (Until the End of the Time was the second book) in this series. The love affair between Martin and Ceylon just doesn't work for me. I mean Lucky in Love's Benny and Clayton had the ultimate romance with a great story line to boot. And this story line just is too forced. Besides that the cover photo looks absolutely nothing (and I mean nothing) like the characters described in the book, which is frankly one of my pet peeves.I waited patiently for this one and I must say it was just not worth waiting for. Melanie, I will continue to read your books but bring us more stories like Lucky in Love that have great characters, great romance and great story lines."
3,Not Enough...,Well. What can I say? This movie doesn't have enough senseless nudity to be called 'Girl School Screamers'. That would be like a movie called 'Womens Prison Screamers' with no shower scenes. That's it...I'm callin the mayor.
1,an embarrassment for mosby---no stars,"mosby should be ashamed for printing this book without having had a living breathing editor look at this thing! my massage school decided to switch pathology books for our semester. we all shelled out top dollar for this piece of junk which had just been published at the time (yes, that's six years ago and i'm still annoyed, guess i need a massage) and then had to go purchase a different book because this was so un-helplful. glaring typos and poorly written. while i am not an expert on pathology nor a writer, i have worked in a medical library for many years and have a good idea of what constitutes a quality book of this type. this ain't it folks."
4,Better than other dictionaries of Classical Mythology,"I think P. Grimal's dictionary(hardcovered one) is the best among many encyclopedias or dictionaries of Greek and Roman Mythology . But I can not say this translation is the best , because there are many mistakes and some omitted entries. If you can read French , I recommend to read the original ""DICTIONNAIRE DE LA MYTHOLOGIE GREQUE ET ROMAINE"" written by P. Grimal himself. Although English-version has these weak points, as far as I know , only this book and William Smith's old ""Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography & Mythology"" are worth to read with Greek alphabet spelling of proper noun et sourses of Classical texts."
3,Will regional differences result in regional nations?,"Nine Nations is really a comment on the nine regions and how they differ. At this point in time its just a commentary. However, the USSR, Yugoslavia, and other nations have split up into separate countries due in whole or in part to regional differences. With gridlock in DC and so many people upset with the national parties, it is becoming more and more possible that regions may become independent countries. If that happens, this book provides reasonable border locations. Looking at the economic differences would tell us what each region (Nation) would export to the others."
5,Differences among different printings?,"I just received a copy of the hardcover original 1981 edition, but now see there was a 1989 printing/edition as well as a 1991 printing/edition.Does anyone know if the differences between the three editions and/or printings are major?"
1,Stupid and wrong.,"Garreu's book is espcially irritating because it's an interesting idea but his analyisis is so sloppy that his conclusions are just plain wrong. A much superior treatment of the same idea is Gastil, Raymond D. / Cultural regions of the United States 1975."
5,Classic,Out of print for a long time. This is the classic BSA guide to religious services. Has a service for every week day.
3,More Celtic than Fairy,"I found nearly all new songs on this CD by Gary Stadler. Singh Kaur's voice is beautifully soothing, but I found her vocals to come through as too deep and 'too much' for the beautiful Fairy Ring lyrics in the second composition. If you love talented celtic voices, you may guess that Laura Drew, Singh Kaur, and Lorellei are all the same lovely vocalist... I enjoyed this CD but not nearly as much as I love listening to Gary's CDs ""Reflections of Fairie"" and ""Fairy of the Woods"" and Fairy Lullabies"" over and over, as I prefer instrumentals. And if I was to choose a favorite vocalist, I'd choose Stephannie."
2,Good compilation but...,This is a great compilation with one flaw. The sound quality is awful. Please look for your Dio music elsewhere. The sound is way too tinny.
4,One of the best descriptions of an alcoholic's suffering ...,"Nobody but Kerouac could describe the horror and suffering of alcoholism in lyrical, fluent prose. The opening pages show Kerouac's true gift as a writer. I often pick this book up at book stores and re-read the mesmerizing beginning where Jack wakes up 'all woe-begone and goopy' as the church bells play a mournful version of ""I'll take you home again, Kathleen"". He describes the alcoholic's hangover as the worst experience on earth -- like standing in pork blood as a 'mudman backbent monster' pulling 'a long hot burden to nowhere'. Atute readers will see hints of Jack's descent into depression and alcoholism in his earlier works. In ""Big Sur"" Jack openly acknowledges the nature of his suffering. Sadly, he would go on to drink himself to death. Kerouac's true gift lies in his original voice as an witer and not in being a joyful icon of the open road. ""Big Sur"" eloquently shows that the man suffered enormously."
5,Lust for life,"This is my favourite Kerouac book. It's written with a real love for life and America's nature. Kerouac is a master in showing life is full of opportunities waiting for you, although the whole of society is created to teach a man not to see those opportunities. The end is surprisingly claustrophobic. Very, very good stuff."
5,Feel good movie!,"First of all why do people give a movie a bad rating because they had a bad experience with the seller?? Use the feedback rating!! That's why it's there! Now getting back to the movie what can I say that others haven't? When I'm depressed I watch this movie because it makes me cry, smile, and leaves me with a feeling of happiness. My favorite part is when Christine Lahti goes on her first date with Reuben Blades and gets drunk. To me the scene is a classic. From being a stuffy prude to learning how much life has to offer and how wonderful it can be no matter what others think is the moral here. I love this movie and can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. It truly is a gem that will leave with you a wonderful feeling all over. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Very cute and raises concerns without pushing it!,I seen this movie late one night and was pleasently surprised how much I enjoyed it. The romantic part was cute but the public awareness added a really great touch to the film. It made me see things differently.
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good movie.Of course the budget for this movie was next to nothing, but you have to look past that.The gore was pretty good and pletiful.The acting was, of course, horrible, but most horror movie don't win awards for acting.This is not a must see, but if you like Zombie movies go ahead a buy it.It is a rare movie so at least you will have it for your collection."
1,Poor quallity,"I bought this directly from AS&S along with some other items. Seemed like a good deal. I should have remembered that, generally, you get what you pay for. This key works, but is made of some sort of cast (pot?)metal. If you're not really careful, the teeth chip off. Better make sure it's perfectly & completely engaged, and doesn't slip while using, or it will soon become useless. I'd have happily paid twice, or three times, the cost of this one for one that would last as long as the drill. Lesson learned. 2 stars for the price directly, because it got me by, but I wouldn't recommend you waste your money. With shipping included via Amazon: 1 star - WAY too expensive. I just ordered a 4-way from Northern Tool for $9.61 (pickup). Only a fraction over what this sorry one costs on Amazon. For close to $10, I expect a quality product. I'll update upon receiving the one through Northern."
4,Nice Flight stick,"Pros - This flight stick and throttle is built very well, very sturdy and doesn't feel like a piece of plastic when you use it. The buttons are well spaced and the responsiveness of both axis inputs is nice, the stick centers very well. Extra perks like changing the LED color of certain buttons and easy set up are nice. I have been using it mostly with DCS: A-10C and it works very well.Cons - The only down side I have experienced is a slight problem with the trigger. Sometimes the trigger doesn't reset fully and you have the first trigger stage engaged and have to pull the trigger out just a hair to get the trigger back to position. It only happens here and there but it does happen. Other than that, no complaints."
4,Saitek X52 Pro - Wow,"Saitek X52 Pro Flight System ControllerThis prduct is great for flight sims, set up is easy, but you may find it will take time to set up profiles for different games, when i first recieved this product it was faulty, so contacted saitek , the ppl at there US based offices are great they had me rma the first one and send it of to them, within a week I had my replacement which works great...well worth the buy"
3,What about the video for Run Runaway?,"I used to have the cassette of this. It is now hopelessly lost, so I have added this CD to my wish list. I especially liked the song Run Runaway from the early MTV video. I bought the cassette later. I listened to it over and over, and remember little about it except for Run Runaway - I must be getting senile."
3,So So,"It was done nicely and I just love listening to Chris Isaak. However, the old version by Bonny Guitar was much better and the words were somewhat different and I liked it much better."
3,Orginal...mostly...,"A really good book, but a few of the scenes were lifted staight out of the movie ""Platoon."" I hope this is a chance thing the author hasn't seen it."
4,Good solid book,"I admit, I have a weakness for historical fiction. This is set in Maine 10 years after the American Revolutionary War. It is a time of hardship for a nation in upheaval, and our heroine is a midwife widow that must find the truth about the rape that her lover (and father of her illegitimate child) and two other men are accused of committing, and the victim's murder that makes all 3 men suspects. I enjoyed this one."
3,"Dark, atmospheric, but the prose is distracting!","The first couple chapters in I thought I was really going to enjoy this book. I thought it had some of the most beautiful writing I had ever come across. I thought the heroine had potential to be interesting, the side story of an adulterous affair, an illegitimate child, and the accused pining after the heroine, all seemed to point to a really good story.Then somehow the beautiful prose began to overshadow the actual story. Half way through I had a hard time concentrating on what was actually going on and had to force myself to pick up the book to read it. I realized that I really didn't care ""who done it"", I just wanted to finish the book.It may be that it just wasn't really a book for me but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad novel. However, since I rate books based on my enjoyment of them I had to give it only three stars. You may enjoy it more than I did though."
5,Viking CF32M 32 MB CompactFlash Card,"This works great in my HP 215 digital camera. I can't tell the diffrence between this and any other CF card I have for it. It's just as fast as the others. I'm glad I went with Viking, they are a little cheaper and just as good."
1,Should be 0 stars; but this machine doesn't allow that.,"There is very little science in this book. It is really about Kurzweil's ego. He frequently implies his software is the future of computing. His ""most significant event"" for 1999 is the publication of this book. Such self serving hype is unforgivable.Predictions for 2009 are easily extrapolated from today's technology (probably because he will be around to be held accountable). Longer range predictions are pure SCIENCE FICTION. According to Kurzweil, humans will become borg-like drones, or even worse, extinct; replaced by self replicating machines. No way!There are some interesting bits of computing history, but even these facts are distorted to promote Kurzweil's agenda.Save your money. Pulp science fiction has more integrity than this book."
1,An unintentional primer for Luddites,"Want to know why many people fear and loathe technology? Read anything Kurzweil has written. This book draws the incredibly arrogant conclusion that just because computers will soon surpass human being in computing power, they will become superior thinkers and spiritual beings.What a load of crap. Tell me, who will write the software that exceeds human intelligence? The machines themselves? Or perhaps the geniuses of modern computing, who can't even write code to shut down a modern PC without crashing it 20 percent of the time.This book is a catalog for sci-fi horrors. It happily forecasts a world with no privacy, filled with carbon-based morons even less willing than today to create works of art or use the one organ that sets us apart from other beasts.But,hey, it will be a great century for blow-'em up computer games."
3,not for me,"I'm sure for those people who are looking for this kind of book will love it. I thought this was the book that I wanted but it is just to intense for me, I like easy and simple, I found it to confusing and to detailed."
5,Capt. Paul,"I use this line as leader. I cast for salmon and trout on Lake Michigan in Illinois and Wisconsin. I use 20 lb. braid, a crane swivel, and 2 to 5 ft. fluoro leader. Same for for live bait. Most of the time I use 8 or 10lb. leader except when the big chinooks are around, then 14 or 17lb. I use a 9ft. med spinning rod. Works for me. Good luck. Catch a big one."
3,Paint by numbers,Haven't started this project yet. A bit intimidating. The canvas and instructions have a combination of letters and numbers to guide your painting. There are several colors that need to be mixed with others. I would suggest this for adults.
4,great game!,this is one of the best snowboard sims i've seen. i'd give it 5 stars but the controls are a little hard to master... once you do though it's probably the best snowboarding game i've played.
5,PLEASE COME BACK TO US!!!,"This series was fantastic, but way too short. That freaking writers strike hurt a lot of great careers! Hoping Eddie actually gets the movie deal done! We'll be lined up to see it!"
1,Bought it for Izzard and was totally disappointed,"I bought Season 1, and was disappointed, and then I bought 2 - mostly because I'm a die-hard Eddie Izzard fan and I think he can do no wrong - but he did. Disappointing. I find the writing somewhat witty, but Izzard is unfunny and wooden, sorry to say. The series should have been cancelled."
3,I rate this book with 3 stars because it wasn't descriptive.,"The Ellimist gave the Animorphs a choice to take a few of their most loved people ( mom, dad, brother, sister, cousin, aunt, uncle) to a planet without the Yeerks. They choose not to give up on planet Earth. They continue to fight the Yeerks and try to defend their planet."
5,Best book ever. even my Uncle was reading it and hes 45,this book is the best. Im 13 and I love these books. Rachel is my favorite character. An ellimist gives them a choice to go to a differant planet. and he shows them a way out. It is so cool
3,Seller feedback,"I was not initially happy with this little book as I was expecting it to be in better shape. It was not damaged, just old and used. The seller immediately offered a refund and apologized. Since receiving this book, I started searching around and realized this series appears to be out of print and at least a decade old. Most of them are used and yellowish. I also learned my niece's fledgling collection is all used and she is expecting this. The book was so inexpensive that I chose not to return, but am pleased with the courteous and prompt offer by the seller."
4,Playing the field has never been so good.,"If you are a little league player or if your child is a little league player this book is a must. After giving this book to my grandson, his performance improved as well as the other players on his team that he loaned the video. His coach had a team meeting at a local pizza restaurant and they showed the video on their big screen. Play Ball: Basic Fielding should be on every little league player and little league coach must see list."
5,What a way to go to work!,"This is a set of songs that can get you to moving along the highway, not even minding the slow-downs that occur. In fact, I grateful for them because I have more time to listen, and as long as no one else is in the car, sing along at the top of my lungs. Thanks, Jimmy!!!!!"
4,Music For Saturday Night & Sunday Morning,"Jimmy Maddox delivers an 88-keyed salute to the gospel by combining righteous boogie woogie with traditional church favorites. It's a mighty spirited affair, filled with a reverent but hell-raising energy that would send both Jimmy Swaggart and Jerry Lee Lewis scrambling for their shotguns. This disc rocks like a church bus on a washboard road. Can I get an amen?"
2,Where's Tait?,"I ordered this CD specifically for Michael Tait's version of ""How Great Thou Art"" and when I received my CD, the song was not on there! I'm very disappointed. If you are ordering this CD, make sure Tait's song is on the CD!"
4,"Comprehensive, Unique, and Dry","This is the first first book I have come across that really delves into the political and economic aspects of military history while not losing a beat in discussing the tactics. Howard does a great job of leading one subject into another, but if you do not have some background in European History, this is not the book to start with. Howard's thematic tool is combatants, such as ""War of the Knights,"" ""War of the Mercenaries,"" etc. While this is effective in converying how one group becomes more important than the previous, he does not really give you a full flavor for why it is changing, concentrating more on weaponry and politics. Overall: read it if you haven't, but make sure you have some background in European history first."
5,great,GREAT!!!This product is great my dog has been eating for year and when I moved couldn't find it any where. Ording it off of this website was wonderful fast and came right to my door step. My dog is very greatful.
5,The most Electrifying product in Amazon .com History,"This is the perfect gift for any World Wrestleing Federation fan young or old. It brings the life of the most exciteing show in cable history, to your very own pc.This is the perfect gift any WWF fan and not just cause' Stone Cold Says so!"
3,Good playing but lacking something,"The CD is quite varied. 1 and 4 are vehicles for Joe Henderson on tenor sax, with 4 especially strong. But Joe's tenor has quite a high tone, which sounds a little 80's ish. Mal Waldron's grumbly, percussive piano style isnt really released until the last track, blues in 4 by 3. Track 2 starts well with the bass but becomes quite irritating. Track 5 is a perfectly competent rendition of How Deep Is the Ocean. Billy Higgins drumming is excellent throughout, in that kind of sowing machine style, knitting things along. Its quite good in parts, but kind of missing something in the aggregate."
4,Everything Rush,"If you like Limbaugh or hate him, this is a ""must have"" book. Get the straight story on Rush's draft deferement, the debt he owes to Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Disk Jockey Larry Lujack. Colford is a serious journalist and does a fine job of shucking this particular ear of American corn."
4,"Excellent product, but expensive","I use this CF card on my Pocket PC. There is no setup required. I just pop the card into my Jornada 548, and im set. Also can be used with digital cameras or any device with a CF port. Ive had no problems, except for one. Its pretty expensive, and I keep on wanting more! CF cards actually go up to 340 megabytes. Maybe ill buy one of those from IBM later!"
3,jazzy and simple,"This cd is by no means bad, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I was hoping for warm, traditional sound... this is more of a funky music-box (even at times - dare I say it - midi-file) sound. If you are looking for a light, airy, plinky Christmas intrumental cd, this one is for you!"
5,Tale of Pony Express as it should be told,"Another outstanding book about the Pony Express. Exciting to read, I couldn't put it down. Full of interesting information I'd never heard before. A true living book. Must read for kids and adults."
5,What a pleasant surprise.,"When I listen to my older Erasure CDs, I still try to dance around the house like i used to when the songs were new. Fortunately, they came out with a CD that I can keep up with a little better these days. In my opinion, this is an incredibly mature and melodic Erasure that really surprised me and has made an Erasure fan out of my husband, who used to hate them. The music is incredibly moving and extremely well done. Their talent is even more apparent when not drowned out by synths and quite frankly, I never knew they were capable of putting out this sort of CD. Very pleasant and WELCOME surprise. Very highly recommended."
2,Slide Guitar?,"I ended up buying this album on sale and am so glad that I didn't pay full price. I am an Erasure fan from way back. I own all of their albums (look at my other reviews, I defended them during their Loveboat days) singles, etc. I am sorely disappointed in this album. I thought Other People's Songs was better than I expected and the Boy EP was better than I expected but this whole album is largely bad. It lives up to its acoustic apellation but the use of slide guitar and the reworking of the songs makes them largely into new songs with the same lyrics and singer. I think that Andy's voice is shown in a great light here. My disappointment is with the music. I couldn't recommend this to anyone unless you like old school country (not even then since I like Johnny Cash but not this)."
1,Good company - bad product,Do not buy this product if you use the stylis. It fits the 8525 screen just fine but it is not flexible enough for the touch screen to work at all.
3,good for the price,"I purchased this for my husband who eats his breakfast in the early morning while my son and I are still sleeping. I thought that it would be quieter than opening a box and rustling around but I was wrong. The turning mechanism crushed the cereal as it comes out and it is very loud.Other than that...it's what I thought it was going to be and for 30 bucks, isn't too bad a product. I still would have gotten it for him. I know that in the future my son will love helping himself to his own bowl in the mornings."
4,An Interesting Look at Mind/Body,"Nick Herbert's Elemental Mind makes an interesting supposition -- that the mind, or consciousness, is a force that interacts with the world, like gravity or electromagnetism. He makes a pretty good argument that ESP and Telekinesis would prove that this is so; unfortunately, his examples (the typewriter open to the quantum void and the branching photon experiment) don't seem to show any evidence that the greater supposition is correct. The book is very interesting, though, and leads one into all manner of speculation about how peculiar the quantum universe and though actually are. A well written, entertaining, and informative book."
5,GREAT READ,"This is classic good story telling. Great plot, easy reading. Great LUCAS story. Keeps you attention through out., BUY IT"
4,Hard to put down...,"This book is written with third-person narration, so readers are able to watch the events unfold from the perspectives of Lucas and the killer. Of course, this means that we know who the killer is, so there's no mystery there. There is, however, a great deal of suspense in the investigation. As with most other Prey books, the dialogue is fantastic! The suspense is well written and there's a constant sense of impending doom."
3,No instructions on how to get the clock put together and keeping time,"You have to be willing to tinker with it to make it work, but luckily I was able to get this clock working. Be sure to place the hour hand on first followed by the minute hand when you are assembling it. From my experience, you have to use a little force to get the hour hand on properly. If you don't, it will fall and not keep time. I was afraid to push too hard, but the thing didn't work so anyway, so I had nothing to lose. It has worked wonderfully ever since I really jammed the hour hand on. If I hadn't been able to get it working, I had found clock parts online or at Michaels. I would rather pay $10 for a new motor than $100 for a nicer clock. It is a decent looking clock... from a distance. Definitely looks cheap up close."
3,Not My favorite game.,"This game is like, Blast Corps only you can go into all the Houses. Driving around and shooting thing's is Kinda' fun, But it can get boring. The game seem's to be more like an RPG game, And since I like RPG's I enjoyed the game a little bit. But, it's not really a game you'd want, To go back and Play."
4,"relatively bulky with a mediocre camera and battery, but ...","... if you need the best reception possible the V710 is a great choice. I bought this phone because my LG VX6000 (also Verizon) couldn't hold a call for more than 30 seconds in my office. I liked my LG and it worked great most everywhere else but I was hoping to get a phone that I could at least hold brief conversations with in my office without constant dropped calls. Well, I have used the V710 for several hours now in my office without a single dropped call. If it had better battery life I would easily give it 5 stars. Great phone!"
3,battery life is bad,I noticed everything fine with this piece except the battery life. The battery life is around 120 to 130 minutes rather than what it is said.The piece is good otherwise.
2,Not worth it,"This phone has nice features, a large screen, a great speakerphone, and a decently loud ringer. The battery life is horrible though, although maybe it should be expected because of the large screen size. Don't bother with this phone if you want the Bluetooth capability because Verizon disable all of useful Bluetooth features, leaving you with wireless headset only. It's a nice phone, but not worth the price."
2,High expectations not met,"I bought this phone with thoughts of a great camera and reliable phone. I have yet to see either of them. After the first month the internal screen went all white after a period of the phone sutting off randomly. I'm on my second phone. The phone just seems very flimsy. Also the camera is absolutly the worst camera I have ever seen on a camera phone. I know it's just a phone and not a digital camera, but I would expect that pictures would be somewhat decent especially becuase this phone boasts a 1.2 megapixel camera. Very misleading. This phone is soo bad I am contemplating paying the 175 cancellation fee and leaving Verizon (since the bastards won't let me switch models) for the very highly rated SLVR and Cingular."
5,A splendidly clear and easy to use text.,"The Critical Edition of Q : A Synopsis Including the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, Mark and Thomas.This is an exceptionally clear and easy to use book.The section on the history of ""Q"" research is a splendidly clear and concise review of the work done today and would bring you up to speed very quickly.The layout of the synopsis in 8 columns is actually a great deal easier to understand than at first glance and quickly becomes user friendly.The Synoptic Gospels, Q and other canonical texts are paralleled in Greek with the gospel of Thomas being paralleled in Coptic. Q is translated into French, German and English with the parallels of Thomas being translated into Greek, French, German and English.I would not hesitate to recommend this work to anyone who is studying in this field or has an interest in it."
1,GET A NEW JOB YOU HORRIBLE PIANIST,Reviewer: A non-music fan from NYCYour music has NO melody. It is just BLA. So why don't you just find another trade to go into...because music is WAY out of your capabilities....essentially...YOU SUCK
5,Powerful Drum Beats & Natural Sounds: Awaken Spirit,"This is one of the most harmonic and balanced CDs ever produced. Spirit touches spirit as the journey of the Shaman is transmitted through the drum beats, flutes, Incan panpipes, rattle, guitar, synthesizers, combined with the sounds of Nature. The soul of the Shaman resonates with the listener on this sacred musical journey. The Ancient Wisdom of nature creates energetic spirals ... illuminating one's personal path.Most highly recommended music. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"
4,Good for fast paced yoga class,"I like Drum Prayer better, but this one is very good. I like drums in my power yoga class, and this cd works nicely."
2,Good when I bought it.,Good when I bought it but too small for my increased needs today. With DSLR cameras I recommend a minimum of four if not eight gigs.
4,plenty of storage,The 128 meg card by Viking provides the perfect balance of affordability and space. This card allows me to shoot over 400 1024x768 shots with my Canon Elph S110. (...)
5,This card is just perfect!,"I got a Canon A40 for Christmas, and is came with a small 8MB Canon CF card to store pictures on. At high resolution (its a 2.0MP camera) I could store 11 pictures. With this card I was able to stores nearly 200.I don't know about you, but I don't take 200 pictures in a week, not even in two weeks usually. Even when I go on vacation. This card provides more than enough storage for pictures or small movies taken with your digital camera, and if you buy a CF Card reader, its a great way to back up your files when re-installing Windows, or just when transfering files from a PC to a Mac."
1,128mb Viking compact flash card,"I recently tried using the Viking flash card. It is giving corrupt pictures. I know it is the card, because I have another card and it is working fine. When I download the photos, some of the them have numerous small rectangular shape color boxes all the photos. Sometimes there is only 1/4 of the photo showing...some of the pictures have wavy lines and I can't tell what the picture was suppose to be in the first place....."
4,You got to have this Flash card,"Hi,I don't know why manufacturers won't provide flash card for those who buy electronics such as digital cameras, when we purchase products worth 100's of dollars they should bundle these flash card of higher capacity....This lead me to buy viking 128MB compact flash card for my digital camera .... very handy easy to use, certian shops ...support slots for taking printouts most of the cameras support flash cards and the read/write speed is good ...Every month the price of these cards keep droping as we take more pictures and fill the card ... :) so if ur planning to buy just buy a bigger card capacity."
3,"Good price, but slow.","No doubt this card is cheap, but the transfer speed is somewhat slow. I did a side-to-side comparison with my 16MB card that came with the Canon S30 camera, and the Viking card's transfer speed is 40% slower. However, I still consider the price/performance to be reasonable."
2,Rebate Hoax,This was my first Amazon order. I stumbled around looking for the best price on this item from a vendor that I assumed would bother to send the product after I had furnished plenty of information to them. ... I am not a big believer in rebates to begin with. To me they are almost always an excuse to bait and switch the consumer into paying more. Despite the fact that the rebate is ongoing and that I would qualify if I was able to jump through the hoops properly there was little simpathy on the part of the Manufacturer (Viking) to support its rebate policy. I only hope that the product does not also suffer from this lack of committment to the consumer.
1,viking 128mb,"It might be good but it doesn't fit in my Kodak DX4330. I am new with a digital camera and I find it difficult to know what extras are needed. What is the difference between a flash card and a memory card?,Guess I""m stupid. Why wasn't I sent a Kodak MB card? I read a review that made the same claim asI did.....didn't fit!! Something is wrong!!"
4,Price that can't be beat,"So far so good. Its not kodak, its not cannon, its not nikon but it might as well be since it fits my Kodak 4800 digital camera. And best of all the price kills the big boys."
5,"This Q&A Scores an ""A""","Quite possibly the best book ever written for the tinnitus patient. If there's one better, I haven't encountered it since my introduction to tinnitus 32 years ago. It's just that this one covers so much ground, and breaks it all down into such clear, manageable chunks. There's no lost time here: Quickly find and read what applies to you and skip the rest. But be forewarned: Tinnitus Today editor Tabachnick-Sanders writing is so conversational, so informative, that I found myself reading about many topics that did not apply at all to my experience of tinnitus. More importantly, I found answers to questions no G.P., E.N.T. or audiologist has ever been able to answer for me. I also found hope, coming away with the sense that, finally, the research community is seriously pursuing effective tinnitus treatments. That alone was worth the cost. In short, Tinnitus Questions & Answers is well worth punching in that credit card number and clicking ""submit."""
2,Neverending Celtiic Knot Sterling Silver Ring,"This ring is one of three I bought at the same time...the other two fit perfectly, and I wear them daily. This one just doesn't fit correctly. It says it's the right size, but it is either mis-marked or this company's size 7 is different from the standard size. Disappointed in the ring."
1,TOO THIN!,This ring looked thicker than it was. It bent on my finger the first day. Quality is NOT GOOD and the photo is misleading.
2,Politically correct,"If you are looking for a book that reinforces the ""politally correct"" bias taught in most public schools, this is it! While the photographs and layout of the book are attractive to look at, if you actually read the text, you will find that it finds fault with Americans on every major issue; from calling some of the founding fathers ""hypocrites,"" to siding with the Indians in our quest to settle America, to focusing on all the negative aspects of WWII, such as the internment of Japanese-Americans, rather than the positive aspects of how we freed the world from the Nazi regime, to pro feminism, very liberal text. If you are proud of our American heritage, and the Christian principles our country was founded on, this book is not for you. I was very disappointed. There is so much that is great about our country, but this book doesn't emphasize it!"
1,Cartoon-ville at best,"These are more like stereo-types than even close to believable caricatures. One tooth? Hair never been cut? Stupid looking? Dopey? The figures and samples in this book look more like in-bred idiots than anything else. Give me a break. A caricature is supposed to have some truth as its base and these stupid-looking things are simply cartoon characters, not be be re-carved, I hope. Well, the mule is good, that's one star. The cow is ok, that's part of the one star. The banjo player is simply ridiculous and an insult to every banjo player, esp down South. Ozark style carvings? No way, cartoon-ville at best. Save your money on this one"
4,Fr. Stan Sings Beautifully ..Fr. Make more Traditional Hymns,I heard Fr. Stan at a Marion conference and really enjoyed his singing. Great moving voice ...I ordered this cd because I have been everywhere for Traditional Catholic Hymns but they are hard to find. Not all the songs were what I call Traditional but I still love it! Even the different styles of song are great with his voice. I would buy another of his cds if they had traditional songs like ....At That First Eucharist...Only thing I didn't like was 3 Ave Maria's on the same cd.
5,Happy South Bay Trails to You,"South Bay Trails is a very good book for anyone interested in hiking the SF South Bay. I hike a bunch in the Bay Area and the South Bay is one of my favorite destinations. The South Bay is loaded with great hikes, magnificent views, and serenity. Lots of good ideas (over 100 hikes) and trail maps in this well written book by Rusmore, Crowder, and Spangle. The Wilderness Press books are always a winner."
4,"Great content, annoying organization","For over a year this book has been my bible for selecting hikes in the south bay area. The authors' trail descriptions are vivid, and their routes are planned well. I have two major grievances: first, their loquacious style can make it hard to determine exactly what turns you're supposed to take and when. Secondly, finding a hike is too cumbersome: you go to page 18 to search the map for the park you want, then back to the table of contents to find the page number for the park, then forward to the actual content. The map should be in the very front or back of the book and should include page numbers. Despite those annoyances, I still bring this book with me every weekend, and can recommend it as a good guide."
5,A Classic,Not a well known movie but a thrilling and entertaining storylinewith three excellent under-rated actors. Saw it as a teenager 20 years ago and it still kept me intertested today.
1,Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was scarier.,"Hitch-hike is one of those small movies you watch becouse you hope that becouse of it's budget they would spend some real quality time on the script and try to make up for it by giving us a good move ie- Night Of The Living Dead, Holloween, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Mad Max, and Blair Witch.So it sould come as no surprise that this film is as bad as those movies are good. David Hess plays a hitch hiker picked up by a husband and wife couple. After getting into thier car he reeks havok with thier lives. I don't know if the movie The Hicher with Rutger Hauer came before or after this but either way it is a much better film. THat movie was suspensefull where as this movie is just tiersome. By the end you don't really care who wins just that the movie ends."
2,The cups don't work well at all,After doing extensive research we purchased 4 of training cups for our infant. They were very highly rated on multiple web sites. He was having difficulty drinking and becoming frustrated. I tried the cup myself and got mostly air and very little liquid. I respositioned the insert multiple times with no improvement. Thinking it was that particular cup we opened the others and tried them. About 1/3 of the time they actually work. The rest of the time you/the baby sucks mostly air. We purchased Gerber brand and a no name brand to see if they were any better. Sadly enough they were. We have used Dr. Brown bottles for the past 14 months. They are great. The training cups are absolutely awful.
5,3 Classic Eisodes of the Lawrence Welk Show..,The C.D. was ordered for my older sister who has short term memory loss and resides at an assisted living facility. She has enjoyed it very much. She loves music and has always enjoyed the Lawrence Welk Show. I recommend this C.D. very highly .
2,Why,Couldnt understand what makes these classic. Same fare. Same cast only younger. Lawrence's accent was not as evident in these earlier videos. Interesting.
2,Works but has issues...,"It definitely works and was easy to set up but my major problem was that the voice coming out was very tinny and it also was difficult to get it loud enough to properly hear over any background noise (including quite typing). So unless you want to sit in complete silence while using this, I would recommend against."
3,Basic Skype Speakerphone,"If you need a basic and inexpensive Skype speakerphone, then this will do. For quality Skype conversation a headset or handset is best."
5,A quality product,I looked all over locally to find bits like these that would fit into my impact driver. All I could find were short bits that needed an adapter to fit my driver. This is exactly what I was looking for and more! There is a great selection of bits and the quality is outstanding too. Love it! They should last a lifetime.
5,powerful book on hell of war & return to civilian life,"Although the author presents veterans who favor and oppose the military, he does not disguise his conclusion that many veterans have been harmed by their experience in the military. This book is an eye-opener to those who have only heard a pro-military line and should be REQUIRED READING for anybody considering joining the military.Although over 100 veterans present parts of their stories to the reader, the book holds together well, with only lucid anecdotes presented.This book should be in every high school library as it contains information that may be hard to find but has a strong bearing on a decision that faces every student upon graduation."
4,wow. this is pretty damn good i think.,"i just got it and i've been listening to it for 4 hours straight without it sounding repetitive. i don't know a lot about jungle/drum n' bass, and i don't go to clubs or even consider myself a fan of dance music, but i personally really like this a lot. it's very calculated, mathy, and sort of nerdy in a good way, and the complexities of the rhythms seem to separate it from the mind-numbing, booty-shakin' static that i, a total outsider, associates with dance music and electronica (whatever that is) in general. you know the cheesy drum n' bass you're hearing in car and shampoo commercials? this isn't it."
4,Interesting Read-Historical content amazing.,"Though written and published in 1978, Hans J. Eysenck's synopsis on pornographic and violent material is relevent to today's culture. The book, though it deals with a primative form of television compared to today's standards, still holds some valid points in how the medium is more and more overtly portraying violence and sex. Eysenck takes a look at how viewing these programs can effect children's mind sights. Extremely relevent to research papers dealing with the history of the effects media has on the brain."
2,its not what i expected,the episodes are edited and weirdly arranged. Its not as fun as watching it on tv. I thought I was getting the full episodes.
3,The Weakest in the Series!!!,"This sequel is nowhere near as good as the first two. For starters, they don't even go to Halloweentown this time, and just doesn't have the spirit as the originals. Marnie is brought to the Halloweentown Witches' Council and asks to bring a group of Halloweentown students to her own high school in the mortal world. If she does not prove that mortals and Halloweentown creatures can co-exist, the Cromwells will lose their magic at midnight on Halloween. If you're a die-hard fan of the series, you might like HALLOWEENTOWN HIGH!!!"
1,blank screen,It wouldnt play in any of our players. We had to send it to disney to see why it wasnt working. We are still waiting to hear back from them
2,Scratchy,"I bought the Cal King in sage and they fit my deep pillow top mattress very well. They shrunk after the second wash but still fit the mattress. The color is very good and I like how it looks on my bed. The problem is the sheets started to pill after one week on the bed and they feel very heavy. I washed them after they arrived and they felt fine for the first couple of days, but then started to get scratchy. I rotate my sheets every week and when these sheets came back around, I could feel the pills when I smoothed the sheets with my hand. The sheets also feel heavy and I will not recommend or buy these sheets again."
2,"Pills, pills, pills!","These sheets are just as described. They have deep pockets and the color is very nice. The problem is that they pill worse than any sheets I have ever owned. Within three days of putting them on my bed they started to pill and are now just a mess. I can't even sleep on them without ""shaving"" them with a pill removing device. Too bad because they fit well and seem to be nicely constructed."
3,Pretty Good,"These sheets were okay, but there are two things I don't like about them:1. They are very, very wrinkly.2. They seemed to shrink somewhat after I washed them a couple of times, and are now harder to get on my king size pillowtop mattress, harder than I'd like. I bought them because they were advertised as fitting even the largest mattresses, which I'm not sure is really true.That all being said, it's really hard to find decent sheets to fit my very deep mattress that don't cost $100-$200, and these are pretty good for the price."
5,Smooth Deep Pocket Sheets,"I've had these sheets for about a year now. I love that they have really deep pockets. All of my old sheets barely fit on my mattress, so after a couple nights they would slide up on one corner or another. I don't have that problem with these sheets.I also really like the feel, they are soft and smooth. I have some 800 thread count sheets and I like these better because they don't feel so ""bulky"". I picked these up for like 40 bucks and you honestly can't beat that price."
1,Starting to Pill,"I was really hoping to have found a nice set of sheets, my husband and I felt them before I unpackaged them to make sure they'd be soft enough (cause I didnt want to open them if they weren't so we could return them). They felt great, and after washing they still felt soft. But after their second use I noticed the bottom sheet starting to pill. I'm disappointed and knew it was a risk buying sheets online. I hope this gives you an insight before you buy so you wont be as disappointed as I was."
5,These Sheets Rock!,"I had a hard time finding good sheets for my california king size bed (the bed also is very deep). I've looked in a lot of stores and couldn't find them or found them at a ridiculous price. These sheets arrived and are awesome, great quality, great fit and I love them! The price was excellent and I got them as promised! Great experience."
5,An in-depth explanation and understanding of the Bible,"Purchasing this 5-volume collection of the life of Jesus did not prepare me for the amazing insight into the human side of Our Lord - even the descriptive way of his laughter brought me closer to Him! During the season of Lent, I read the entire Passion and was actually there, walking the streets to Calgary, realizing how much He suffered for ME, yet knowing only a God-Man could handle this much torture. Well-loved passages from the Bible are enhanced and described in detail that amazes and delights. These books affirm the existence of God in our world!"
1,No pinyin,"A resource called ""Streetwise Mandarin"" focusing on slang and colloquial expressions should be oriented to teaching spoken Chinese. The text, however, is in Chinese characters and English, with no pinyin; only the vocabulary lists include pinyin.I am learning spoken Chinese and am not studying written Chinese. I really need a resource focusing on slang and colloquial expressions, but""Streetwise Mandarin"" is useless for me."
4,Pretty Good...But not a Freud!,"Not a bad little bit, although I must admit I've become spoiled by the Freud brand. Having a mix of Harbor Freight, Skil, Freud and now PC bits, I can say that I have a pretty good perspective on where this bit falls...somewhere in between the Freud and the Skil, but closer to the Skil. I seems pretty sharp right out of the package, cuts relatively smooth and left only a couple burrs in some scrap red oak I was free-handing just to test it out. I did notice the red(laquer?) coating on the bit started to flake off after only a few feet of cutting. I don't think this effects performance, but it is something I've only seen happen on the crap HF bits."
3,Not many options out there but this is decent,"OK first the pros, this will save you a lot of time compared with the ""pull out the hose and spray it around"" method. A lot of time. And your patio plants will love you for it too--I grow tomatoes, herbs, and flowers on my patio and all my little ones produced much better when I got this (with less water waste).The downside... The attachment from the spigot to the machine always leaked. I couldnt' get it to fit perfectly right, despite trying everything in the manual. It would be really nice if they also included a rubber tube or something to fit over the threads and the end of the tube that attaches to the spigot to make sure nothing leaks.The machine itself also conked out after about a year...I changed the battery and everything, but it never worked right again. I did buy another, but if there was another option out there I probably would have gone with a different brand."
2,Low quality timer,The timer on this kit is extremely low quality. All of the fittings are plastic and it seemed as though the threading would strip on its first installation. The knobs fell off the first time I tried to use them.
4,wonderful product!,"I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the other reviews, but it turned out to be super easy and quick to put together and works beautifully. It doesn't leak at all. I would have given it 5 stars but the the instructions were a bit confusing and timer doesn't work. That is ok with me though bc it only takes a few minutes to water all my plants at once with this system. So glad I bought it!"
1,What a joke,"I randomly came upon this album a number of years ago; it is such a joke that I was surprised to find it for sale, especially at this price! DO NOT spend $10.99 on this album without at least first hearing some of the songs. It sounds like something out of a circus show by a bunch of 12 year olds and it is hard to believe it might have been done under serious pretenses. I wonder if the makers of this album are related to the person who created www.realultimatepower.net. The fact that the editorial review of this album gave it any praise at all makes me highly skeptical of the quality of reviews from music critics. The only thing this album is good for is a few laughs with your friends."
3,Profound,"It took some time to read, as it challenges the mind and spirit. I have shared this book with a number of friends."
5,"This book is not fairy tale, it tells reality","When you read books they are usually about fairy tale lives, the guy gets the girl, the girl marries her prince, ect.... But cleawater crossing books tell about real teen life. Sometimes you might find a part in the story that relates to you. Maybe it might give you advice. Cleawater crossings also are page turner books. Every page leaves you yearning for more. So far I have read 2 of these books in the Clearwater Crossings series and am eagerly awaiting to read the rest. Clearwater crossings are intruging and awesome."
5,Brilliant and lunatic,"This is a great, great book. Incredibly funny, and very San Francisco. I will buy any book he writes."
4,"Good, but not Smolens' at his best","So far, I've read only two books by John Smolens, ""Fire Point"" and ""Cold,"" but I'm looking forward to reading all he has to offer. Next up is ""Quarantine."" That said, I'm glad I started with ""Cold,"" which I loved. That story was tightly written and a real page-turner. ""Fire Point,"" on the other hand, meandered quite a bit, and it was only in the last few chapters that it got close to holding my interest the way ""Cold"" had. I was surprised to find out that ""Fire Point"" was the later of the two novels; it seems more like a debut novel. Still, the characters are well-developed and complex, and the book is worth reading. But if you're choosing between ""Fire Point"" and ""Cold,"" I'd recommend starting with the latter."
3,Another Horse Fantasy book,The main character is Jessie a kid who wants to ride horse. She thinks that it is so simple when her and her best friend Pam end up at a pony camp seh think that it is her dream come true. She think that she will be jumping in a week Note: These type of book really bug me because everyone think that riding is so easy (I know that all riders agree with me) She ends up on a cranky spotted horse. Worst of all her wost enimie shows up there. what will she do?
4,Helpful product for preserving my brand new laptop,The sleeve proved to be very effective in protecting my laptop from shocks that it would have suffered in the day-to-day life at school. Just a little remark: the outside texture of the sleeve makes it easier to catch dust or the like form the surface where you place your laptop and so always looks a little messy.
4,better than your average bar,"These chocolate bars are not only a great way to treat yourself but they also make a great gift. They are better than your average chocolate bar, with grown up flavors and high quality ingrediants."
1,Received soft gloss instead of matte,"Maybe it was a shipping mistake, but I received soft gloss instead of matte. I've been desperately searching for HP Premium photo paper, matte finish, 8.5x11, but the only two sellers BOTH sent me soft gloss. Does this product no longer exist?"
4,Never forget what you had read!,"It's hard for Anne Wingate and her father to accept the doctor's diagnosis: Anne is HIV positive. Seven years earlier, before blood screening was required. Anne received a transfusion to save her life, and the blood was tainted. Now Anne must deal with inevitable progression of her condition. When an anonymous benefactor promises to grant a single wish with no strings attached, Anne decides to spend the summer on a ranch out west and live as normally as she possibly can. ONE LAST WISH is the novel that will make you cry and it can keep you up all night to get to the last page. Lurlene McDaniel is very good at describing people. You better get the book and strat them right away."
3,"Very good book, but not enough for the exam","It's an excellent book that gives you strong foundations but it seems it has not been written for the exam. You will be very surprised to see how questions in the exam may be radically different. In order to pass the CCNA (and have the best score), I HIGHLY recommend to work with Todd Lammle's CCNA Study Guide! Those two books are complementary."
3,"Good Book For The Beginer , But Too Many Mistake","Easy To Read , Reader Friendly And Simple Examples. Beginer's Best Choice.But , Too Many Mistake And Left A Lot Of Test Course Aside . Need A Good Exam Note To Help Out! ( Todd Lammle 's CCNA Exam Note ISBN# 0-7821-2535-2 )"
2,Usefulness,"As a practicing L.A., I have bought several McGraw-Hill Construction Books. I get a similar result each time: They seem on first look to fulfill the promise, but I found they don't well serve the need in real life. I get far better use out of Architectural Graphic Standards, and I'm looking forward to Wiley's Landscape Architectural Graphic Standards."
3,LOW QUALITY GRAPHICS,Very valuable source book with tons of low quality graphics. It is also very heavy to carry around. Good for your library.
3,"decent, but same as online","I've just finished my applications for law school and have to say, this book was very little help. You can find plenty of examples of good essays online. One reason I didn't find it helpful was, there is no consistent theme between all the essays. There is no ""one thing"" that makes an essay a Harvard Accepted one... and a non-accepted one. I think I expected to see similarities or consistencies between the styles or subjects or formatting and there just isn't. So, I think your time is better spent working on your own unique essay and having it double and triple checked for grammar and spelling."
5,A great start (and not just for teens),"Just about everything in this book is a ""must read"" for computer users in general and Windows users in particular.This book is well-aimed at teenagers (without a hint of condescension). On the other hand, there's nothing in here that doesn't also apply to adults.Could more be said? Sure; about social behavior in MMORPGs, caution in social network sites such as MySpace and Facebook, lots more that wasn't even around when the book was written. But at least start here."
5,Love this movie!,I ordered this movie for my Granddaughters. Together we have enjoyed it very much! Great movie to enjoy for Halloween!
3,Halloweentown,It was fast shipping but I felt that the products case was in bad condition with markings on the front. The DVD was in good condition though.
3,Be Careful,Anyone who buys this product should be warned that it contains a very powerful toxic smell that is overwhelming. One ought to be very careful when using it. The smell is like paint thinner on steroids. This is not to be taken lightly.
3,It's an ordinary book and the Kiss fans deserve better,"This book is pretty much basic info about Kiss more aimed at newer fans or those mildly familiar with the band. Knowledgeable fans should avoid it. The flow of the book doesn't work for me as the comments by band members and others in the book gives it a confusing touch. Other reviewers have well detailed the flaws of this book but let me say it is average and adds little to understanding the Kiss legacy.By far the best book on Kiss is ""Kiss and Sell"" by C.K. Lendt who was a former Kiss employee during their 70's heyday. This is the ultimate Kiss book and a fantastic rock book in and of itself. Buy this and I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
3,A hard hitting dose of reality,The symptoms and effects of workaholism are well detailed and explained. But hope and the recovery process are painfully absent.
5,one of the best so far!!,this is a wondeful book. probly the gear's darkest so far. i recomend this book to any gear fans specaily if you have read Slience and Anasazi Triogy series becuse MOON connects all these storys together. great read!!!!!
2,"This book should have been called ""After the Water War""","About a quarter of this book actually covers the Water War and what lead up to it. Very basic explanations of what happened and why. The eight days of chaos at the height of the Water War are left almost without description. It seems an odd thing to skimp on details of when the time was so critical.Most of the book analyzes the impact for privatization and social movements. It's more of a scholarly book than an explanation for the average person.The end of the book covers the ""Gas War"" (the fight against privitization of Bolivia's oil and gas reserves)."
4,Great math manipulative but only 4 bags of rubber bands for 5 boards,"I have purchased 4 sets of these 5 Geoboards. The boards themselves are sturdy enough for student usage. I didn't notice it until I bought them but they actually have numbers on them going from 0 to 10 along the X and Y axes.My one complaint and a reason for taking off a star is that even though there are 5 boards, they only include 4 bags of rubber bands. Also, some of the bags equal quantities of green, gray, peach, and red colored rubber bands. Each rubber band is a different length. However, some bags are also all peach with one or two other colors thrown in.The rubber band issue wouldn't stop me from purchasing it, but I will probably also be buying a bag of assorted rubber bands."
1,This book is bad!,"After looking through the book, I found this book not so structured. The diagrams are not enough to get the reader easily understood. The description of how the algorithms work in the book is unclear. The book just listed out some basis without further looking. And the 'see also' reference in the book makes the readers jump from page to page without giving the titles of the pages. The material covered by this book is ok, but it has the potential to improve."
1,Your just paying for the name !!!!,"You would think that purchasing a SONY, that you would be getting a quality product, right? Well think again! Poor headphones, poor belt clip, hard to change the tape, NO auto reverse, battery life very short, poor sound quality! I found nothing about this Walkman worth praising. I would have rated it ""0"" stars if they had provided that option. Save your money and buy a different Brand.PS: Quit playing tapes after only two months!"
1,Okay while it lasted,"I bought this in a bricks and mortar store, and wish I had come to Amazon and read reviews on it first. Especially for this price, this was very shoddy equipment. I had the same problems as other reviewers with securing the player. I listen to books on tape while I work around the house, and I had a terrible time keeping this player attached. Unlike another reviewer, I did NOT find that it survived drops well, and it was sporting duct tape very soon after I bought it. Two months later, it simply stopped playing tapes. No amount of new batteries, manipulation, or pleading would get it going again. Very, very disappointing."
2,Too Small in the butt,The pants are cute but run very small. I had to return them. If you want to buy these I would suggest buying them big.
1,Byer Junior Tropical pant,"These run real small through the waist and hips, normally wear size 4 ordered 5 ...could not even zip them...order 2 sizes larger!!! Legs are gigantic, returning mine! Good Luck!!!"
1,Horribly Undersized,I knew A Byer clothes ran small so I ordered a 3 instead of my usual 1. I received the product and the pants would fit a 10 year old. Far to short in length and poorly made.
3,guitar lessons,"The dvd and download lessons are very well done,however they were alittle to advanced for my abilites at this time."
2,"Sound quality, maybe... comfort, no...","Looking for a replacement for old Plantronic headset, so decided to stick with the brand... chose the over-ear headset, and not comfortable. Ear loop seems too thick for comfortable wear. Agree with other that for short period of time, OK... longer (hours), not good.While sound quality was generally good (tested on a call to a cell phone), but noise suppression doesn't work well: picked up background typing, even on a quiet keyboard. Even my 5 year old Plantronic did a better job at background noise suppression. Returning it..."
2,"works, hurts your ear","Sound quality was ok. Read the reviews here first, and breezed by all of the 'Hurt my ear after a few hours'. Well, it hurt my ear also. The wife tried it and she said the same. Bought this months ago. Its in a drawer now."
2,Find something better,"I ordered this to use with my cordless phones. I wish I had heeded what others mentioned; the wrap around ear piece is stiff plastic and pinches. It should be, but is not, flexible to mold to ones ear.The sound is adequate but features are disappointing. The volume slider buttom is stiff and difficult to feel in order to adjust when wearing the headset. Further, it does nothing for the volume on the receiving end (the sound coming from the headset); it only works for the volume of your voice for those you are talking to.I am told by others that the volume does seem to increase the volume of my voice up to 40%, which is good since I tend to be soft spoken. But frequently it creates an echo on my end; since it has occurred randomly, I believe it is a headset issue and not related to the brand of the other phone.I'd find something else if you use a headset, as I do, with regularity."
2,"Great concept, won't stay on your ear","The sound quality was good but the earpiece wiggles on your ear, unless you keep your head perfectly still. Very annoying, it keeps falling off."
2,You Get What You Pay For...,"I bought this because I needed a headset/microphone that was cordless and I didn't want to spend much money on it. Well, you get what you pay for... sound quality is not very good and it is hard to hear with this, even with the volume on the phone turned up. I actually had to push it further into my ear and hold it there with my fingers to hear well. Kinda defeats the purpose which is to be ""hands free"". It now sits in a desk drawer, unused. Ended up with the MX505 model at about $35.00 and like it!"
4,Intriguing satire!,"This was my first Coupland book. I know nothing about this author or his other works. I was in an airport desperate for something to read, and I grabbed this book at random. This book was excellent! The satire was perfect, the two main characters were extremely likeable, the villain (Susan's mother) was detestable, the plot was great, and the suspense was perfect. This was an excellent read! I could not put it down. I didn't give it 5 stars because there are some serious continuity issues in the book, and I'm sort of a stickler for things like that. These errors should have been picked up by an editor."
2,Please try again!,"Doug, we felt we had a voice in Generation X, we felt the depth of the conclusion in Life After God, and we felt the depth of pathos in Girlfriend in a Coma, but what happened with this? It seems as if Douglas Coupland has drowned in his own cliche's. Chapter after chapter of character development with no real plot. Was I meant to pity these people? Blame their past? Their upbringing? Yes, yes I know the style, every third chapter refering to a different character, but where are we going with this? What are you saying? I felt no pity for these people written like some characters from a Jerry Springer show. However if you want 35 chapters of character development then read on. Otherwise choose something from an earlier period of Coupland - you won't be disappointed!"
2,Coupland's Gen-X meanderings are rapidly becoming cliche.,"Miss Wyoming is Coupland's attempt to capture again what he hascaptured in every book he has written since Generation X.Disillusionment, love interest, pointless psychologically-draining scenes, unrealistic characters. The only thing that saved Microserfs from this was its hip-technological context. It is as if every book I read of his is rehashing the same material. (Notable exception: Life After God. I'm always fascinated whenever I re-read this book.)"
1,And Miss Wyoming is...,Would you be seriously interested in knowing who Miss Wyoming is? No.So why read this book?
2,did not like,"This is a hard to do routine but also quite boring, which makes it harder to stick with. I didnt like it at all."
2,"Fun, but Repetative","I really enjoy rebounding. It helped me jump into my weight loss program. It's fun and easy. I wanted to try some routines so I bought two videos to give it a try. I found the trainers slightly annoying and the routines to be dull. I liked learning the basic types of bounces but it seemed VERY repetitive after the first 10 minutes. I prefer to use the basic moves I learned from the DVD's and do my own thing. I keep track of my heart rate on a monitor and can change my intensity that way.Buy one and see if you like it, I wouldn't buy them all unless you try one and REALLY love it."
4,Great Compilation,"I own most of the Urban Rebounding DVD compilations, and enjoy them all. The music and presentation is just enough to keep my feet and heart going for the full session. My only wish is that Urban Rebounding would make another DVD, this time with a more advanced and longer workout."
1,Broken Stone,"The ring is beautiful.. This company is crap. Who sells a ring with the garnet stone with a chuck of it missing? Pitiful. If I had noticed it earlier, I would have petitioned for my money back."
4,A good KM introduction for managers.,"The concepts in Knowledge Unplugged are nothing particularly new, if you are familiar with the area of Knowledge Management. Written in 2001, it is a good survey of the thinking around the subject that was current in the 1990s.This is not to imply that the book is not valuable now. Practitioners should find the metrics from the McKinsey global survey valuable, even if the treatment of the concepts feels as though it may lack the more detailed current understanding.I would particularly recommend the book as an introduction to an interested executive who wanted to understand KM basics. The clear language and underlying survey support would make it a good way to begin a dialogue on the subject. I found the emphasis on sharing and reuse as a learning opportunity for the rest of the company particularly relevant and well-explained."
2,Very difficult read,"I had a very hard time following the language in this book. It wasn't written in a way could be easily understood or followed. I consider myself a very spiritual person and I understand the idea of the Bodhisattva as I had already done my own research on the topic. However, I had to put the book down after only a couple of minutes. I did not enjoy reading this at all and quickly lost interest."
5,The good side of aristocracy.,"Rachmaninoff's playing on this cd is one of the best he ever did, in my opinion. I am always amazed by the craftsmanship of his performances considering that he did not have the benefit of modern sound editing techniques. His playing here is always wonderfully polished and smooth. Even in the most bombastic passages there is a feeling of reserve and careful calibration of sound. He plays with an emotional detachness that I can only describe as aristocratic and cool. This, however, does not substract from the natural intensity that a musician of his stature automatically delivers. His playing is surprisingly ""modern"" in its avoidance of superfluous effects and pianistic hystrionics, favoring instead passionate sobriety and control. Truly a pianist's pianist."
2,Good Sound - Poor Tuning,"Thought this would be a good unit for morning walks, unfortunately it is nearly impossible to tune to the station you want to receive. Because of the small size of the unit the tuning dial is extremely broad in its tuning capabilities. You spend endless time trying to adjust to the station that you want to hear. Once the station is found however, the sound is good. The unit is a little on the heavy side owing to the fact that so much electronics is packed into each ear phone."
4,Good companion for a bus commuter,"I got this to listen to the radio on the commuter bus in Los Angeles area. FM doesn't work so well other than loud pop-rock stations, but AM is fine. The FM problem is probably because of the bus ride, since when I'm walking on the street, there's not much interference. I usually listen to AM news stations during the commute rather than music anyways, so it works for me.It is fairly heavy on my ears, though. It doesn't bother me so much during my 30 minutes bus ride + a few minutes walk to the office, but I don't think I can work out with it."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED........:(,"I have been waiting with baited breath for this book. MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE was sooooo good, I just knew the sequal was gonna be ""tha bomb""! I was dissappointed. Very dissappointed. The beginning was slow and when it did pick up, it went back downhilljust as fast. This was a busy book; too many friends and relatives to keep up with. Found myself flipping back, trying to refresh my memory, on how the numerous characters were related! Too many issues that could have been left out of the book. I did appreciate the younger man/older woman twist,especially when it wasn't along the same storyline as HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK. I'll continue to buy Melanie's books, even though this one didn't do it for me. She has so much potential, I'm confident she'll get back on track. There are more relatives in the Devereaux family who need their own story."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"This was a waste of time to read. The story was slow. The story line was weak and the climax was boring. I usually love this series, but the author should have given more thought to this story. I wish I could return this ebook. I extremely confused by the 5 star rating."
4,Let It Be Me,This would have been a great read if it wasn't for all of the errors. At this stage this should not be happening in Ms. Schuster books. It seems someone just skimmed over the book instead of proof reading it. Sometimes it was difficult trying to figure out what word should really be used in the sentence.
2,Muddled despite good performances,"The performances are generally good (although some of the actors lay the hillbilly schtick on a bit thick), and a few are outstanding, but all in all, it's a muddled, confusing brew. The scenes of abuse are truly harrowing (how did they film them, for God's sake?), but you never get a sense of what drives the story. What makes these people tick and act the way they do? We're left with stick figures for the most part, which is a shame. In a more adept director's hands, this could have been extremely powerful."
2,Too Extreme!,"Though I found the acting in this movie quite very good, I find it disturbing that Actress/Director Angelica Houston could use a young girl in an extremely graphic depiction. I was just in shock! Much like Louis Malle's, Pretty Baby"", I didn't see the relevance. Houston could have done a better job telling the story without the graphic nature. Please be forewarned about this movie. It is too extreme!"
4,A must-read for open minded voters,"Senator for Sale is a must read in the next two months. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who says/believes that Bob Dole has the ""character issue"" advantage over Bill Clinton! The book shows, with sufficient documentation, the Bob Dole will sell his vote to the highest bidder -- often making people VERY RICH in the process.Did you know that long before the Whitewater people went to court, one of the Doles closest business partners was convicted and did jail time for illegal activities directly associated with the Doles? Why havn't the ""liberal media"" picked up on this?On the down side, Hilton is a lawyer who writes like a college sophomore... not exactly the heights of prose! It also hardly touches on Dole's personal life -- another area where Dole hardly has an advantage on the ""character issue.""Nevertheless, I still recommend Senator of Sale"
1,This is NOT a touch screen remote!!!,"This remote simply uses lighted buttons under a semi-opaque overlay and displays whatever functions are available for the selected device. I found that this really wasn't useful at all. In fact, the lack of tactile feedback from the smooth ""screen"" made the remote hard to use. I quickly retired it for my old remotes that I can find the buttons on without looking.That said, it wasn't nearing as hard to program as the other reviews made it out to be, although I wouldn't suggest this for someone who isn't at least slightly tech-savvy."
2,Barely readable,"I was very disappointed with this book. The narrative style is almost unreadable-- a very sloppy, disjointed, stream of semi-consciousness. The characters have far too much in common with the current crop of self-conscious, hip, urban consumers, and not enough depth or spiritual insight to make it worth wading through their drivel. The author's dedication set me up, I suppose, when she referred to another author as a ""fellow wordsmith. Sorry, but Samson is no wordsmith--that requires craftsmanship and honing. Here she just throws words on the page like a preschooler smears globs of paint onto construction paper. Can't reccomend. Can't even remember if I finished it. Do know it was neither gripping nor challenging. (I speak as a lifelong churchlady myself)."
2,Singing....,"Ok for a choir, but make sure your type of singing. I'm southern country gospel. This did NOT work for me. Gave it away!"
1,Poor.,"This album takes half-hearted holiday recordings of many of the greatest musicians ever (e.g. Louis ""Satchmo"" Armstrong), and puts them all on one album. A listner new to these musicians would write them off on one hearing and never experience the dizzying heights of their work. This album trudges along from one atonal tune to the next, making the listener wish Christmas didn't come every year. Please, don't use this collection as a stocking stuffer-- the recipient would prefer a lump of coal!"
2,not what expected,"This wasn't quite what I expected. The CD worked, and all the songs worked, so that was ok, but the CD case was broken, the CD roughed up, and it had a DI sticker still on the case."
2,Be careful,"I bought the Huey on recommendation from a friend and a couple of favorable mentions in articles in photography magazines. It has not worked out. After calibration and recalibration there is a greenish tint to the grays on my monitor. I have tried everything I could think of to get rid of it. The adjustments via Huey's own setup are minimal and very large. No fine tuning is possible. Calibration with my monitor's own software and the adjustments via my graphics card setup prove to be infinitely more accurate. I wrote to Pantone about the problem and 2 weeks later I still have not received an answer. Save your packing materials, just in case you have a similar experience and want to return it."
4,Works like a charm!,"After a quick set-up, this small device really keeps the colors on my display adjusted. The calibration only took a couple of minutes, and the screen colors are well-defined."
1,terrible item,"Either all the people who love this item work for Pantone or I got a lemon. And since a couple of other reviewers reported having to exchange a few until they got one to work, I think quality control is an issue. It is easy to install. What is not easy is calibrating your monitor to match their settings. As another reviewer wrote, I also found it impossible to make the top 3 rings match the lower ones - and after you install and reinstall the software a few times (just in case you or the computer did something wrond) you just want to give up. Moreover, no matter how I adjusted the levels, a preset screen showed a suspiciously similar ""before"" and ""after"" image. And my own before and after printed photos confirmed that nothing was adjusted. I've returned the item, because I do feel it could be defective. But it wasted a lot of hours and was needlessly frustrating. I fell for the Pantone reputation. Don't."
1,bad product,"I bought a Pantone Huey last October...it worked great until January, then just died. Tried re-installing software, using a different USB port but nothing worked. Wrote to Pantone and they replaced it with a new one, no questions asked (good!). The second one lasted about 3 weeks then also died."
5,As a gift,"I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend who is a graphic designer and he loved it. He uses it everytime he's on the computer, even if he isn't designing anything. The colors in the monitor are so bright now and look so incredible that he can't stop printing everything he creates."
4,An excellent starting point for color calibration,"I bought this when I started printing my own photos at home, but it's useful whether you send your photos out to be printed or do it at home. The price is about right if you are just getting started with color calibration.The basic Huey device is easy setup and use, but I don't really use the auto light adjustment. It's small enough to take with you if you use a laptop (in fact it's always in my laptop bag). If you are going to use it with a laptop, then I think it's the perfect buy, but if you are going to use it with a permanent desktop setup you might want to consider the pro setup since there isn't a huge price difference."
2,Not for me,"I wanted a cheap profiler for amateur photography. I don't have an external monitor, so I only work on my laptops - an older MacBook and various Dell Latitudes and Inspirons. The Huey did not do a good job of profiling these laptop screens - results were inconsistent across laptops, and even different in Windows 7 and OS X on my macbook. Profiles were visibly ugly and tinted. Perhaps it would work better with better monitors, but I wanted something cheap for cheap screens. I returned the Huey for a Spyder 3 express which does the job perfectly."
3,Continuous Callibration Causes Problems,"I tried this product yesterday and it did a pretty good job at callibrating my monitor. It very easy to use and the instructions provided are easy to understand. The software that comes on the CD is not compatible with Windows Vista, but I was able to download an upgrade from the Pantone site which had support for Vista. I had problems with continuous callibration (which callibrates the monitor based on changing light conditions). The continuous callibrations caused my monitor to get a pinkish tinge which I didn't like. So I had to reset it and re-callibrate and this time I didn't choose continuous callibration. Due to this problem I will give it 3 instead of 4 out of 5."
2,Easy to Use but Doesn't Cut It,This little device is easy to install but does not correct your screen to match prints. Save your money and try something else.
1,very disappointed,If you own a copy of Photoshop use Adobe Gamma. No matter what I did this thing made my monitors worse not better. The factory default setting for my monitors was the closest to true color when printing color samples. Very disappointed and was hoping a product with the name 'Pantone' on it would produce desired results.
3,Had a lot of problems installing it,"I had nothing but problems installing it, and the help desk people weren't much help. I'm a big computer guy, and never have problems with this type of thing. I'm guessing my virus blocker doesn't like it. It's a great tool if it works for you. Good luck.Nick"
1,I'd like to give it zero stars,"I bought and read this book several years ago.I recall that it was horribly written, even though I am entirely sympathetic with the author's message. The book appeared to be written by a professor who does not know how to express himself simply or clearly.I give it one star because it is written so poorly. I would like to give it zero stars, but I believe that isn't an option in the Amazon ranking system.If ecosocialists can't write better than this, we're certainly doomed."
4,Great But,The directions on putting this item together are very confusing. The sizes of the bolts and screws are difficult to understand. They need to package the bolts screws and washers for each step together so you can follow the instructions. The bolts have a number at the top however different size bolts had the same number. I love the machine. But this company needs to talk to Sauder on how to make instructions to build something this big.
4,Great piece of equipment...but not easy to assemble.,Product is extremely well made and functions perfectly. very solid and looks like ti will last for many years. I have used it for several months without a single problem. The only issue is that it does take a significant investment of your time to assemble. Plan on spending an entire Saturday to complete. Would have given it a definite 5 stars except for the assembly time needed.
1,Nut Job,"John Muir spent to much time in the sun, drinking bad water, and eating mushrooms. This guy can be seen today sitting on a branch, cracking acorns with his teeth. I have no idea who decided this nut job was a great conservationist, but those people are sitting on the same branch with Muir."
5,Amusement Park and Good Food? It's true!,If you are going to the MK and are vegetarian... get this book!! It was so helpful and we didn't have to guess where to eat.
5,"A lovely, bucolic setting in northern Wisconsin!","I really enjoyed this book, particularly since I have a good friend who raises angora goats and I am also a native of Wisconsin. The book made me homesick for Wisconsin and it was also a wonderful story of the range of emotions generated by raising animals."
1,Not safe in my opinion,"I bought this toy two years ago and I was not happy with the weight of the middle piece that lays above your baby's head. It is basically supported by the balance of three legs and the legs are attached to the cloth mat (not very securely either). I kept worrying the huge, heavy mirrored piece would fall on the baby. I ended up taking it apart and just using the mat and basically the rest was trash."
4,Overpriced here on amazon,"I do agree with the other reviewer that said the ""middle mirror is too heavy"" the base does attatch to the mat but i wouldn't trust that too much, it could easily get knocked over if you accidentally bump into it.. dangerous if your baby is underneath. The toys ARE a bit hard to reach unless my son is laying half off the mat so he can reach them.My 4 month old seems to like this gym & it entertains him for about 10-20 mins. at a time.. that's something at least. I think that the company needs to make the legs/mat more sturdy."
4,Perfects Yoga for someone in a wheelchair,"This is the first time i've tried doing Yoga. I loved it. Yes, it is stretching exercises, but a good relaxation, stress reliever DVD as well. I try to do this everyday. I have found that the relaxation technique is good to help me fall asleep at night. I recommend this for people in a wheelchair as well as seniors."
5,Great Excercise DVD,"I love this instructor, not too fast not too slow. There are also various methods of doing each excercise depending on how flexible or how strong you are. I will watch for more DVD's by her."
3,Chair Yoga Program-enjoy the benefits of Yoga,This video is geared toward seniors who have not exercised over the years. Itwas actually informative in presenting ways to do some yoga movements while seated.
1,Stopped Working,The DVD stopped working after a very short period of use. I'm disappointed to say the least. I want to replace it but I'm hesitant in case the same thing just happens again.
3,Cranes going crazy!,"Thomas & his friends like to get the job done, but Cranky, a newcrane, thinks it's fun to call Thomas & Percy little bugs. Cranky laughs until a storm knocks him over & Thomas & Percy have to rescue him. This video is a must own to your collecion!The stories on the tape are very good. The songs are good too.I quite like the one where Toad the brakevan goes a little toofar when he goes forwards for a change. The one about the newdiesel gets teething troubles is good too. I hope you enjoy it!"
1,Will not deal with Amazon or this Vendor again!,My order never arrived and when I requested that the product be resent - by the time Amazon got around to addressing my order - the product was no longer available. This was 3 weeks after the order was placed! This is the second order (for different products) that Amazon has messed up.
2,Second rate songs from 1st and 2nd rate artists,"This was the first album I ever bought that I disliked so much I got rid of it. There are some top names here, some familiar from what was probably my favorite album at the time: The Flashdance Soundtrack, and my favorite artist at the time: Bonnie Tyler, but the songs here are not their best works by any means. I still love Pat Benetar to this day, but ""Here's my heart"" was really rather forgettable, as are the rest of the songs on this album. Interesting concept to combine modern songs (the early eighties was the era of the big pop music movie soundtrack) with an excellent silent film, but it just didn't work with the songs they picked here. Footloose was the other way around: great songs with a lame movie."
1,A classic has been defaced,Metropolis is a great film of American history. It is a beautiful classic that should be appreciated for the stunning things Fritz Lang did with it in the 1920's. Instead a few washed-out 80's bands make a mockery of it. Metropolis or anything of it's kind can not be parelled by loverboy or billy squier. This has only made a ridiculed the genius of Fritz Lang by tampering with something to please fans of 80's electronica.
5,Well Acted Gothic Cinema,"This movie is an excellent bit of gothic British cinema - a gothic romance in the truest sense, greater doom than Cathy & Heathcliff. Some really well turned out performances by an excellent cast, gorgeous costuming and excellent settings. Snow! Real snow, even - meaning that part of the filming happened during an actual winter (I'm really impressed). A bit melodramatic but quite worth watching."
4,Interesting by far,"This book is interesting, thus why I purchased it. It covers a bunch of basic science. It was published in 1995, so the information isn't too outdated. It didn't look like anything shown was dis-proven, however I've not read the book in depth. In any event, overall I like it. It would be a good book for a general science class."
3,"Hey, look at me, I'm Brian Lopes!","Short on skills, big on Brian. Self indulgent of the Lopesman. Save your $$ and try another publication if you really want to improve your off road skills"
4,Back to Basics,"I have been riding MTB for a few years, but this book brings you back to basics. By following a few simple rules, I no longer get dropped on the down hils, not scared of rough single track sections and manage to jump over those smaller obstacles that used to slow me down so much. Excellent book for beginners and old hats who want to sharpen their skills"
4,MTB Excelent tips,"(From Chile)If you are looking to complement or improve your skills in All mountain - Enduro MTB riding, this book is THE BOOK!! It's cover all the situations that you may find in the tracks."
1,Mountain Biking,"Very difficult to read. Probably useful to a professional racer, does not give a clear picture of mountain biking to the beginner."
1,Where's the 3-D?,"This is, by all appearances, an original copy. But I cannot get 3-D effects on any computer, TV, or projection screen. It is a 2-sided DVD, with 3-D on one side and regular on the other. But nothing I did helped. I was quite disappointed since I purchased it to show to students and had actually acquired a classroom set of 3-D glasses. They had been looking forward to it. But it was a bust."
2,Mysterious? Or not so mysterious?,"Having had the honor of meeting the author of this book, I feel in a small measure qualified to comment. Conversing with him, I was impressed with his intelligence and insight, so I had to give ear to his assertions, however outrageous. He has some very compelling arguments and research to back his claims on the undermining of the US and even world government by extraterrestials. The objective question is, where are the researchers he cites? Who are they?The mysterious visitors in this case are some Catholic priests who came to his lectures and later he realized they were aliens. Sure, there may be life in other planets, but are they here walking among us? He thinks so...."
2,Boring,"At his best, Kweli is great, but Kweli is at his worst on this one. The lyrics are very tame, uninteresting. The beats are OK. The only song really worth owning is Soul Music."
1,Mad Monster Party,This was a colossal waste of time...87 minutes I will never get back! Ridiculous to the point that the fact it was so astonishingly stupid made it quite funny to talk about afterwards and remember. I dont think my kids will trust my movie picks again!
4,Animagic monsters unite!,"Well done tale of just about every monster in the horror genre made into clay animation (animagic). Not as enjoyable as most of the Rankin/Bass holiday animagic specials, but still quite a delight. It's pretty dark, similar to Nightmare Before Christmas, with some heads coming off and stuff. Not for the very young.The DVD is much better than the video released a few years ago. That video's colors were very dull and the DVD has livened things up. We need more Rankin Bass on DVD!!!"
3,I agree.,"I am not partial to spending my time reading about pathetic, immature, and shallow people. (Also touched with ignorance). I did finish this story so it wasn't all bad; although none of the characters are people you would want for friends, they did seem real"
5,perfect song set to becoming a idol to you preschooler and their friends,perfect song set to becoming a idol to you preschooler and their friends. Only missing a few gems (i.e. Big Beautiful Planet - why this was left out is a mystery to me.)
3,Cost versus comfort tradeoff,The battery performed well and was a good bargain compared to the original equipment option. The problem is that the battery is twice as thick and twice as heavy as the original battery. It comes with a pastic cover that replaces the original battery back-cover. I use the pocket PC for reading books and a heavier pocket PC was a little irritating.
5,Danny Welton Soothes Your Very Soul With His Harmonica Playing,Chromatic Harmonica at its very best. Danny Welton is a master at his craft. He started blowing through a Harmonica when he was 3 years old and is still blowing us all away. He knows music to a T and his Harmonica playing is unmatched. Totally unmatched. Two Thumbs up for Mr. Danny Welton. Get this CD everyone.
1,Not a great book,"I didn't enjoy this book at all. It was a chore to read. The main characters Maddie, Warner and Samantha were boring from beginning to end. The plot was horribly choppy. Not a good read at all."
2,DVD needs improvement!,"I must say, they make good workout programs, but really need to improve DVD quality. Sadly I can only use 2 out of 4 workouts because of bad pixelation. Although it was still a good price, dealing with bad DVD is frustrating."
3,Clever but frustrating.,"Steve Meretzky shows a true talent for combining sci-fi and humor, and no less so in this amazing game. Unfortunately, it is so full of glitches despite the fantastic concept- nonlinear storylines, multiple responses to different actions, etc., these are lost in the buggy response times and freeze times throughout. Because it plays like a beta when it shouldn't, I gave it only 3 stars- also because I was unable to find patches on the web.This game should be restored for a console- it would probably do pretty well if the glitches were ironed out."
3,Mediocre,"I thought it was kind of silly. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it but it can't compare to the depth of character and plot that I enjoy in mysteries by Louise Penny, Jacqueline Winspear and Charles Todd. I can hardly wait for their next novels."
4,Local Color Mystery,"I have purchased all of the Hamish McBeth mysteries for my recreational reading and am now consuming them all. If you identify with small communities and enjoy local color and characters, you will not be disappointed. This is not to say that you will not see parallels in the characters seated in the cubicles next to you on the 34th floor of a Manhattan office building (been there, done that). These books examine the human condition in a humorous manner but without condescension. Beaton (actually Chesney) obviously is fond of the locale she has crafted so well in the Scottish Highlands. Death Of A Prankster is a fun read especially for Hamish McBeth fans although it occurs ""off site"" from Lochdubh. This series is a excellent refuge for readers who have read all of the Midsomer Mysteries of Caroline Graham and crave more."
1,disappointed,"I bought this book after reading the reviews, and seeing that it is well rated, but am very disappointed. It really doesn't have that many knots. there are a lot of pages wasted on many different ways to tie the same knot, like the bowline. there are also a lot of wasted pages ( to me ) on decorative knots, which I will never use. I was hoping to see a lot more useful knots for camping and climbing, but they're just not there, like a sliding knot for tent ropes to adjust them, and a sliding knot to use like an ascender. Very disappointing, would never have bought it if I could have looked through it first."
1,Wasted My Money,"I suffer from chronic back pain. I ordered the DVD in hopes that it might help to minimize the pain. I wasted my money. These stretches are for someone who is very flexible and with me having a bad back, it is not something I feel comfortable doing. It was also hard to follow because my tv is on the wall and I needed to constantly look up to see what stretches were being done. I would not recommend this product if you suffer from back pain."
2,not for people with active back pain,"I was disappointed with this DVD. I bought ""Back Care Yoga with Rodney Yee"" because I am currently dealing with lower back pain and friends said yoga could help. However when I got the DVD I was unable to do most of the things in the routines. I can't think of something harder for someone with back pain to do than sit cross-legged and try to put their forehead on the floor. Also there are no examples or suggestions of how to modify poses if you can't do what the instructor is doing. Nice production value and nice view of a beach but this just felt like someone told the guy to do a ""yoga for back pain"" DVD and not a lot of thought went into the abilities and limitations of the people who would be watching the lessons."
2,Only for true novices,"If you have very limited flexibility and are not very good at yoga, I suppose this might be useful to you. But, the holds are extremely short and the duration of the session is only about 30 minutes. If you've got any athleticism or flexibility at all, buy a different one."
2,misleading,"The variety of stretches were fine, but the description of what is included is misleading at best. Unless you do guided meditations for 1-2 minutes, this is not really included. It seems that it should be more than 24 minutes as well. They describe what they will do at the beginning, then flow right through, so if you thought you could break at a section, or review it, you would be mistaken. Overall, probably not worth paying full price for, maybe renting it at the library or borrowing from a friend, just for the various postures."
3,Good if you have back issues,This DVD is definitely good if you have back issues and can not participate in regular yoga classes or DVD's.
5,Excellent!,"I thought this DVD was going to stink to be honest because it uses a chair and a strap (use a belt to save the $). I am more of an intermediate yoga person, so I thought this might be blah. However, I have a slipped disc that flares up occasionally and my normal yoga, running, and weights are not options when that happens. I started doing this every day for one week while skipping my other workouts, then did this every other day in addition to my normal work-outs again and did it make a HUGE difference! This is excellent not only for pain, but I simply feel like my back is stronger and I am more conscious of my posture. This is now part of my normal routine and if my back flares up again, I'll do just this again until it feels better.Have a chair and your strap handy next to your mat and you will be just fine. It is quick, so the price seems a little steep, but how much I've used it, it was worth it!"
3,"This is a STRETCHING DVD, no strength excercises at all.","I think I'm done listening to these reviews on here, this is like the 3rd product where the reviews have RAVED about it and it ended up being not accurate. So Rodney Yee is cool and all, it's a great product to improve flexibility and provide general stretching, but I was actually interested in a back STRENGTHENING DVD. He provided no strength exercises but rather a bevy of different stretches. Don't get me wrong, they felt good and I always felt relaxed afterwards, but it simply was not what I was looking for. Also, be aware: to do many of the exercises you have to have a lot of yoga paraphernalia: blocks, bolster, stretchy band, blankets. For only doing stretches, I would have preferred something a little more simple. Oh well...back to the search for a good back STRENGTHENING dvd!"
3,"40 minutes of fluff, 20 minutes of strengthening/flexibility","I like the 20 minute chapter where Mr. Yee takes you through some strengthening and stretching exercises. However, the first and last 20-minute segments are largely unproductive. The first time you use it, the first segment (""exploration"") does give you some insight into how your back works. As it has very little in the way of conditioning, you'll most likely skip right to the second (real) segment on a daily basis. The third segment (restoration) seems to be Gaiam's way of pushing yoga-specific merchandise (bolster, blanket, blocks, etc). Again, there is no conditioning here. I do think the ""strength and flexibiity"" 20-minute segment is very nice, and has helped a lot with my posture and given me better flexibility and relief from my herniated disk pain. So I personally think I'd buy it again, but cost aside there was a chance to make this a really nice 3-segment dvd and they instead made a decent 1-segment dvd."
5,Great Avocado Recipes!!,"This book has some fantstic avocado recipes. If you like avocados, this book is a must have!"
2,Didn't do anything for me.,"This product didn't do anything for me. If someone asks me for advice, I would recommend trying something else. I gave 2 stars b/c it may be just me."
3,Handy small guide book to start with furniture collection,Edward Lucie-Smith wrote so many books that I would be surprised he remembers this one. Every body needs to start a passion with a guide. This might be your choice. You will choose the directions you want to explore and will buy more recent and more specialised books afterwards.
5,awesome,This stuff is amazing!!!! Put it on and rub it in.. then wipe it off. Your lips feel like satin!!! I highly recommend!!!
1,Not good,"Wow, how did this game get any positive reviews? First off, the camera is virtually uncontrollable. For example, in the first 30 mins. of play, you come to a room. You can see that there are 5 or 6 guys waiting to kick your butt. So I go in and the door shuts behind me. THE CAMERA STAYED OUTSIDE! So I was getting my butt thumped until I could move into the room far enough for the camera to get in. Climbing on walls and looking for things was very difficult because of the camera. Everytime I would try and straighten the camera to look for something, it would jerk back and auto-center itself. I tried looking for options to turn off the auto-center. There are none. I was tickled to hear Bruce Campbell narrating. However, his snarky sarcasm got old REAL quick. Truthfully, I stopped playing this game after the first mission. Frustrating and not fun (in my humble opinion)."
4,Great songs,Great Young songs and arrangements. Only complaint is the recording sounds somewhat diffuse or muddy.
3,"Don't listen to the other reviews, Highly Overrated","This is at best a decent NY album, but it certainly doesn't deserve 5 stars. I own most of Neil's albums (including his 80s output) and this is probably the album I listen to the least. It's very accesable pop/folk, without much substance. If your not a big Neil fan and like your music easy to swallow than this is for you, but if your looking for something deeper and ultimately much better try Neil's classic 70s albums (Tonight's the Night, Time Fades Away, On the Beach, etc) or the album that came directly before this, the amazing, Ragged Glory."
2,Compilation 5,"I like the stretch workout on this video, but would have liked to see a couple more works out on this compilation. I don't really recommend this product, due to the fact there's only two workouts."
5,Great Family Game,Our family loves this game. My five year old can even play by himself. I bought two boards and then we can play with large groups of people. People can visit while you are playing and the length of the game is easily adjusted. Great purchase!
4,Classic toys,"I have had two of these controllers over the years. When I first heard about them, they were ASCii-branded, and were dubbed the Super RPG Pad (classic EGM article). I stopped looking for them after a while because I heard the plan to release them fell through. Then I found them under a different brand in Target. Bought one brand new, and later, another one used. The only thing it really needed was a vibration motor. It's a perfect controller for if you, like me, tend to snack while playing video games.I've been meaning to pick up the PS2 version, but they're very rare."
5,Don't leave home without this.,"This handy map of London lists the museums and tube stops so you can look at it without having to revel you need help locating a place. Not only does it have the museums it has an underground map to tell you which tube station is closest to your destination. If it's raining the map is plastic coated, how cool is that? I keep a 'post it' stuck inside to list the sites I really, really want to see.Bon Voyage"
1,another heated travel mug disappointment,"This is the 5th heated travel mug I have purchased over the last 3 years. This one proved to have the shortest life of any of them - JUST 3 USES! Followed directions for rinsing etc., but when I plugged it in the 4th time, NOTHING! I REALLY wish there was a company out there that made a GOOD heated travel mug! The other 4 I have tried have been only marginally better than this one. Save your bucks and just microwave your hot beverage in a microwaveable mug before adding it to a non-heated travel mug, BUT don't drink it too soon!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the HipZip about a month ago and was excited to receive this MP player. The sound quality was good, however, the player became ""jammed"" a number of times and I had to constantly reset the player to have it begin playing again. Given its price, I believe that it should have performed better."
3,No good ...!,I had it for a month before the disk got stuck inside. Ounce that happens their is no way of getting it out. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
4,MP3 on the Cheap,"Great Product. Once you replace the headphones the sound is terrific. The only downside is the size of the player. Much larger than most players out there. For the price though, there isn't a product with the versatility this baby has. 40mb is a little too small to fit most albums, can be a pain to constantly switch disks."
4,Has good features...,"I like the rechargeable batteries and also the 40 MB zip disks...but the player does have problems. It doesn't seem to be relibable enough. My player keeps turning itself off for no reason. This happens while i am jogging, so i don't know if thats the cause of it (it shouldn't be)."
3,great when it works,I've used the HipZip for over a year now and primarily use it biking or at the gym. I've had to replace it once due to hardware problems (the player no longer recognizing the discs) and the new player is now doing the same thing. The player is now out of warrenty and it'll cost me 70.+ to replace it.I figure two chances is enough to get it right. I'm buying something else. I hope Iomega figures out this problem bucause it's a great player when it works.
1,Oh Pleeeease...,"As a librarian, I once told a co-worker that if I came across one more I'm-scared-of-monsters-at-bedtime book I'd scream. So AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH! My advice to the publisher would be to select more imaginative manuscripts. This one's stillborn."
5,what we wanted,i ordered these for a christmas present. my grand daughter is going in the clinical part of her nursing program.
1,Very disappointed in the content of this novel,"I was very disappointed in the content of this novel. I found it very offensive that a trusted publisher of Christian books would even consider publishing a book that was as ""racy"" as this book was. There is no excuse for an author to write a book containing prostitution activity and descriptions of sinful, sexual behavior. Regardless of whatever the message was that the author wanted to get across, she could have done it without going into detail. She could have just worked into the storyline that the saloon had been previously used by the devil, and now was to be converted into a respectible establishment--albeit, one that still condoned gambling! I can only hope that Christian parents will review this book before allowing their teenaged daughters to read it. Shame on all of you for compromising your standards to meet the approval of the ""world'; and for reaching out to another reader audience for the purpose of financial gain."
2,What happened to a book having an ending?,"I know this book is part of a series, but I was disappointed that there was no hint of an ending for this particular book. It just kind of left you hanging, and based on the back cover of the next book, simply moves along to another main character. I kept reading, thinking something would start to gel, but it never did (at least for me). I don't know that I will read the other books if this one is any indication of how the others will be. In fairness, I will say the storyline led me to want to keep reading, but some sort of resolution (at least in the life of one of the characters) would have left me feeling better about the book."
5,Great Book,Loved it! Very inspiring. I'm itching to read book two. Totally worth reading. Defiantly get this book. Five Star Book!!
1,NOT FULL DIN,"This product is NOT Full DIN size as it is advertised, it will NOT fit a DIN sized space as it is advertised. I was really disappointed to receive this EQ only to find I have to spend a couple of days crafting a case for it in order for it to fit neatly in my car.So to reapeat. It is NOT FULL DIN, IT IS WAY SMALLER. If your planning on buying this product to fit tidily into your car, don't."
3,An Interesting Voyage,"This book did a good job explaining the author's trip from devout Catholic priest to Deist. He used good examples to explain how he slowly started doubting, and how his outlook changed while he grew. It was interesting to see how he could continue living a godly live throughout his journey. It's not the deepest book ever written, but it's certainly worth a few hours' time."
5,Full bodied light caffine tea.,"This is a great tea for those who like a full tasting tea without compromise. It is light in caffine, but taste great. I have been drinking this tea for years."
4,A pretty good book,I thought this book was pretty good. It surprised me in the end. If you like R.L.Stine then read this book
4,A very good book.,"It was very unpredictable, you didn't know something was going to happen unitl it did. The main character had many hard times and I would have guessed that the aunt would turn on her"
2,a good book until just before the end,"This is an ok werewolf story which is almost good. The way the ending is done is silly, and really disappointed me."
3,Bad book....,"I saw this book in a bookstore about, oh, 3 years ago...and i REALLY wanted to read it...and so now, here I have it.But I wish I didn't. The ending was pretty good, but confusing. I especially liked how she went to her doctor, but, uh....well, i don't want to ruin it for the rest of you who HAVEN'T read this dumb book.....anyway....You know how when the girl is at the doctor's office, and he's putting her in a trance, and instead of her waking up, they just end the chapter? Well, it would've been cool if STINE had made everything after that just part of a dream! HeHe, that would've been tight!!*sparkle*"
1,Incomplete package,Continuum DVD not in package. Ark of Truth pixilates stops and skips over parts on both DVD player and Computer DVD player.
2,Caution,"Be careful with this one. Little documentation, and not all monitors can take advantage of the automatic calibration feature, one of the reasons I bought it. My monitor was not one of the supported monitors.It was cumbersome to manually do the configuraton, and in the end simply returned to Amazon which promptly refunded my purchase"
1,Lazy Manufacturer,"STAY AWAY IF YOU HAVE A MAC. This product uses software for MAC intended for PowerPC era. Despite Apple's transition to Intel in June 2006, the manufacturer didn't bother to update software in 5 years. Well, guess what, Lion no longer gives you a way out with Rosetta. Let's see how many of these you will sell now."
4,Great Concept...,"An independent review...This is what I consider to be the best program I have found for my twin 3 year olds to date. It will keep them from messing up their computer operating system. I have a computer set up exclusively for them and this is where I think the product stands out. You don't even need to monitor. The kids will be exposed to all sorts of educational games/web sites etc. (Kind of a baby sitter, not that I am promoting hours of computer use.) Recommend a high speed connection. If the kids share your computer and you start their games or look up web sites for them, you may not need this product. I think the user interface could use some work and the desktop could be more efficiently used but that said, the company is off to a great start into an area of software that was badly needed!"
5,Ax Learns How To Act Like A Human,"I liked this book because Ax 'morphed' into the Animorphs and goes to the mall and the movies! At the food court he ""pigged out"" and ate everything in sight! He then turned into a lobster and almost got fried....great book!!"
3,a little slow,"bought this movie because i dearly love shiri appbleby, the plot is a good one but the story line was slow. shiri does the best she can with what script she has to work with. movie lacked passion. special effects were a 6 and i was hoping for a 9. i like movies about the bible, that deal with myth and legends and lilith is quite an interesting subject but this movie does not deal much with the lilith myth, but instead cheapens that legend. buy this movie for a couple of bucks, but not worth more than that..wait and catch it on tv on a day when you have nothing else to do."
4,Entertaining for Brass Players,I enjoyed this thoroughly. The prose was easy to understand and the stories were entertaining.It motivated me to purchase Clarke's Technical Studies exercises and start playing again.
2,"Movies fine, though covered with a discolored film and obliterated holder . . . all sealed in 'new' plastic.","The movies are fine, though covered with a 'filmy' substance? Beyond the DVDs, EVERY plastic item was broken. The case, the cover was slashed, the inside circles holding the dvds were smashed and mailed along with the DVDs, rubbing up against them all the way; even the file folder-type holder for the next disc had broken hinges. All of this and wrapped in plastic flawlessly - with torn open ""security stickers"" UNDERNEATH that. I don't know if this is Bootleg or what, but if I want to watch the movies themselves, they seem to be fine; I just have to be VERY careful with the container as it is impossible to not scrape and scratch the discs (thankfully I still see no damage on the discs themselves but for that odd discolored film on the underside). Disappointed."
3,Okay,"This CD is cute for children who are already fluent in Spanish. The story line is nice, as it is R.Kipling's classic story 'Jungle Book.' The CD will probably not make your child's list of favorite CDs, but will provide minor entertainment. There are no amazing graphics to report; nor is there anything genuinely interesting about this particular spin on the 'Jungle Book' tale. The video is a little flat; the animation is not spectacular or 'eye-beguling' to a child. However, it is a cartoon and kids seem to find a moment for cartoons. After 10 minutes my granddaughter lost interest, which is odd for her; she loves to watch CDs. The CD is short which is good. Overall, 'El Libro de la Selva' is just 'okay' - nothing more - nothing less."
4,Someone actually read the book!,"For anyone who appreciates when classic literature is read and respected, this version is for you. This version, unlike most other versions, actually follows the book. And, in my opinion, that more than makes up for some of the movie's shortcoming of having been obviously low-budget. I have since purchased other children's classics from these producers and have yet to be disappointed. While they may not have the huge budget to have perfect production quality, they respect and adhere to the story as it was written -- something I believe my children will thank me for someday."
4,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li,"Powerful forces are converging on the streets of Bangkok. They are warriors, some of whom possess extraordinary abilities, all of whom are determined to see their side prevail. Some fight for us; the others for unlimited power. Now, they are preparing for the ultimate battle - of terror versus beauty, light versus darkness, and good versus evil. A solid and entertaining Street Fighter movie."
2,Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li .....,"I, like many others, have always loved Capcom's Street Fighter games. One of my favorite characters to play as has always been Chun-Li. I was looking forward to this movie for that one reason. But, when I saw this movie, I just couldn't believe what they did to it. I thought the last movie was awful but this one just blows that one out of the water. And, of all things, I thought Kristen Kreuk would be the one redeeming quality to save this film. Yet, even with all her beauty, it wasn't enough to save this film.Folks, no joke-- this movie is bad. Real bad. I tried watching this movie twice and fell asleep during it both times. I barely made it to the end the third time. Thank Heavens, though, I did.What gets me is the trailer made this movie look so good. Too bad, it was such a big disappointment."
3,Not bad,"If you are expecting anything more out of a video game made into a movie, perhaps you should watch another movie. For all the horrible stories I heard, this movie really shuns those reviews. It's not bad. The storyline is good. I sat through the whole thing. The characters are camp, as they should be. Kristen is great. Neal McDonough is my favorite. He is the ultimate character actor, perhaps not best fitting for the role of Vega, but still good. And cute to boot, ladies."
2,Hardly a legend,"Ever since she was a little girl, Chun-Li's sole ambition in life has been to become a world-class concert pianist. But when her businessman father is unceremoniously whisked away in the middle of the night by a ruthless corporate tycoon bent on ruling the world, Chun-Li agrees to be trained by a martial arts master so she can get her father back and bring the villain's empire crumbling down around him at the same time.Burdened by kindergarten-level storytelling that makes ""Kung Fu Panda"" look like stark documentary realism in comparison, ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" is a far-from-legendary, barrel-scraping fiasco marked by stock characters, bland performances and rote dialogue.Heck, even the martial arts sequences fail to generate any genuine excitement or pizzazz. Stick to the video game instead. At least you can participate in that one."
3,Decent,"This little device works well when you know how to read the frequencie. i love the voice alert, but i wish it was a little louder, its a little hard to hear when you are listening to music. once again this thing does not detect cop cars! overall it works well for my personal needs."
4,Great Collection,"Wow, you can't beat the best four comics to ever appear on Saturday Night Live in one package. Hilarious skits from Dana Carvey, Chris Farley, Mike Meyers, and Chris Rock provide a great time. Don't miss it!"
2,Ok Movie But Not Great......,"I purchased this DVD because of the word Massacre in the title! Being a huge fan of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies, I thought this might be really good. The box says.. Move over Leatherface..Here comes The Jackhammer Massacre. In my opinion, No movie can compare itself to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies, much less Leatherface! However I bought it and was a bit disappointed. The movie is a bit boring at times but did contain good death scenes. The best thing about the movie was the gore. It centers around a man named Jack who's badly addicted to drugs. Being so messed up by drugs, Jack believes that everyone is out to get him and kill him. He takes revenge on people by killing them with a jackhammer which I admit is ""different"" and a refreshing change. Overall, not a bad movie but not as good as I expected. It's worth renting if you are curious about it. There ARE worse horror movies out there."
1,We all want more music from Jeff but...,"We all want more music from Jeff but I think the vault of unreleased material is empty and we should just enjoy what he put forth for us to hear. Songs to No One sounds like Jeff trying to find his voice and his sound, not an album that was ever supposed to see daylight. There is nothing notable on this album and it has convinced me once and for all that I will just have to be satisfied with Grace and Mystery."
4,Fantastically Detailed,"This account of the infamous Gacy saga begins with the dissapearance of Gacy's last victim, and details the surveillance, capture, and prosecution of one of the world's most famous serial murderers. Terry Sullivan's attention to detail with the account is commendable but at the same time is the reason I gave the book a four and not a perfect five. Sometimes his descriptions of forensic issues drag on past what is necessary and become boring. Overall the book is enthralling. The accounts of the interviews with Gacy, before and after his arrest, are mesmorizing. Sullivan's first hand account of events makes this book a must read."
3,Average True Crime,"This book focusses on the police investigation, arrest and prosecution of John Gacy. The book lacks intrigue and is much too long in parts. It contains very little insight and/or speculation into the psychology of the killer. On the upside, the facts are well presented and the gore is kept to a minimum. Still an average read at best."
5,Kaufman You Son of a...,"Hey this is a great book. When I was done for some reason I yelled the title of the review, ...except I completed the thought. Don't know why either. Guess after reading Llyod's Make Your Own Damn Movie, it just comes out of me automatically now. Really the book brought out a lot of emotion, so maybe thats why I yell out to Kaufman, the way some people say Jesus Christ!. It's a good name to take in vein, Kaufman. Say Kaufman! It's got that hard biting K sound along with a pretty good M & N sound. How's that Lloyd, does this help? Now go watch my short in ifilm dammit! Minx Labrada's Untamed Forest."
3,Too fast! No Repetition.,"This cd doesn't give you time to try to recall the phrase. It also doesn't repeat the phrases. Some of the phrases are quite difficult to figure out, so it would be helpful to hear it multiple times (ideally, from multiple speakers.)All that said, it does what it says."
3,An ok read,This book was ok but not great it read more like a Biographie than an Autobiography. I find Biographies a bore. there were some interesting stories but I felt these were told by the writer more than by Dee Billy Ricky or David. if you are an Elvis fan and like Biographies I think you will like this book a lot.
5,Doctor's Pick,"As a physician and psychiatrist, I have longed to offer my patients a weight management program which is comprehensive, psychologically-minded and grounded in real science. This book takes you where no diet can - into the emotions and behaviors which drive disordered eating in the first place. Dieting is an obsolete, low-tech approach to a complex problem, which is why it doesn't work! Am I Hungry? gives you the tools to change what goes on in your brain: the way you think about food. And that's powerful medicine."
2,Not what I thought it was!,"I don't know whether or not to buy the album, ""Hey Now Now"" turned out to be a boring and lackluster song. Don't Shake My World is not such a bad song on this single, the musical instruments go well with this song."
5,great investment!,"I bought this ""toy"" for my 6 and 10 year old girls - they love it! My kids are very active and this is a great way for them to burn up that extra energy. Everyboby in our house loves to play on this, even me! In fact I kind of hog it! Anyways the only thing we have to be careful of is our 15 month old daughter. Since the board does rolls, it can easily crush little toes standing too close. We put down a sturdy rug and our rule is that no one go on the rug while the board is being used. Easy solution! Hope you enjoy this as much as we do!"
4,A Hit,"A holiday gift for 3 kids who love to ski but live in a compact NYC apartment. Between the 3 of them there's always someone practicing. I remembered having one when we grew up and I loved it (though my brother was the one that could do headstands on it). It's nice to wood-- not plastic around the house, too."
2,Cheap and it shows.,"Like the other reviews I was very disappointed in the construction of the this board. This item is made up of pressed and glued layers of plywood. What's more disconcerting is that the roller is also made of this ""wood"". The roller is made up of four discs of wood and numerous little square pieces that fit in between. All held together by a long bolt. I seriously doubt the longevity and durability (greater than one year) of this product.Frankly it looks like someone went to Home Depot and bought some cheap plywood. Made some cut-outs and put it in a box. I'm returning it today.I gave it two stars because of its price. Its definitely cheap, compared to the other boards made of solid wood, and it shows."
5,Fun.,My nine year olds used these at school for their PE class and came home and asked for one. I told them they could pool their money and I would order it. It arrived quickly and they have had hours of fun on it. Even my husband and I have enjoyed balancing on it. It is a fun and entertaining way to get some exercise and strengthen muscles. The quality has been good and has held 200+lb people without hesitation.
3,"fun, dangerous","I bought this so my boys (ages 5 and 7) would have something to do besides tear up the couch while watching TV. They are always moving so this seemed like something to engage their bodies... well, Everyone loved it but my Dad. He thought it was too dangerous and would knock a hole in the wall.Instead, in the course of normal use - it broke. Its been sitting on Dad's workbench for three weeks awaiting repair.Not well made. Yes, it is dangerous. Probably not my best idea. I still like it. But the disign doesn't take what little boys have to give."
3,Not enough current.,May provide enough current to charge your Ipod. Does not provide enough current to charge my cell phone or power my USB hard drive.
2,Weak Vanilla Flavor,"After researching brands of vanilla bean paste, I decided to go with this one as it consistently has the best reviews. However, I'm not happy with this product at all. The vanilla taste just isn't there. It's great for adding the vanilla bean ""look"" to my recipes, but I found that even if I use a lot, I still can't achieve a good level of vanilla flavor. I used about 1/3 of the bottle for a frosting recipe but it still didn't have the vanilla flavor I was seeking. I had to add vanilla extract for that.I thought it would be thicker and have more vanilla beans in it, but it's about the consistency of maple syrup. It shouldn't be called a paste, as it really isn't. Pastes are very thick and don't run. I won't be buying this again."
4,Good vanilla,"This vanilla is really good and I like using it in my baking. Since I largely bake gluten free, I use a lot of vanilla (these recipes call for more than ""regular"" recipes) and it gives the baked goods a good taste."
3,Sugar added,"I bought both this product and the LorAnn Extreact to compare, as they were both comparable prices. Unfortunately they were not comparable in product. The Nielsen-Massey had no flavor to speak of. The LorAnn was very aromatic. Also, I was very disappointed that this product had sugar in it."
2,"stingy selection, mo' cuts please!","these are all great songs, but hey, there's alot more they coulda put on. Most modern CD compilations include up to twenty songs, especially those of the 2-1/2 minute variety, so just ten dont get it."
4,Very engaging,"The Copper Beaches has all the right ingredients for a fun and entertaining mystery. There is a governess in distress, a murky old mansion, a prisoner in a shuttered turret, and of course, Jeremy Brett as Holmes. The mystery is quite intriguing and reminiscent of Jane Eyre. However, as with all the Holmes stories the real attraction is the relationship between Holmes and Watson. This story gives some great insight into the singular personality of Holmes and Watson's loyalty in putting up with his eccentricities. All in all, it's great fun."
3,Prenatal Yoga,"Great, indepth and informative, but I need to extra incentive in a class not on my own. Great cards though!"
1,I did not like the deck option.,"Instead of pictures it has poor drawings, it is hard to see exactly in some cases.I found the books a lot more explicit and more descriptive.I returned it the same day I got it. Very disappointed with it."
2,Don't like,"Too boring, black and white sketches are hard to follow. I prefer the yogiboom ones. They are much more concise and easy to follow."
5,Eludes a simple description,"This has to be the one of the most remarkable TV series ever made. I initially purchased this set because of childhood memories of Rover. I can remember being about four or five years of age and having the TAR scared out of me when this spherical Corrections Officer/Monster/Machine rose from the water to chase a seemingly innocuous man. Yes, not much to go on if you're trying to decide whether the purchase is one you want to make, but I have to tell you that I am MORE than pleased with my decision to buy Set I. So much so that I've purchased Set II and wait in great anticipation for the release of Set III.The series is witty, humorous, horrific, sublime... much like real life can be. It delivers messages on so many levels, that I feel each episode requires several viewings in order to appreciate and fully understand the dynamics and true aim of the Village.....END"
4,Perfect!,"This is just how I remember it when I was growing up in Brooklyn. The only difference is that the sticks are plastic not wood. The plastic is a very durable, thick plastic though and I think they are actually better then the original wooden ones that would get all beat up. I like that I can store it under the bed and that it doesn't need batteries too. My 5 year old daughter also loves it and so does everyone who comes over our house, both adults and children."
3,"Good premise, average execution","A very interesting premise that is well presented -- until you get to the Yoga sequences.The sequences are very basic and very repetitive -- with the same photographs being used over and over again.In short, there are better books on the practice of Mindfulness and there are better books on Yoga practice.If you want both in one book, then this one is OK. Although, personally, I'd recommend Erich Schiffman's ""Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving Into Stillness"" over this one.My copy of Schiffmann's book is well thumbed. But I doubt that I will pull ""Mindfulness Yoga"" off my bookshelf too many more times."
5,Ridiculous must have for my cat,"I have a bengal tabby cat who sniffs and walks away from catnip. When I bring out Da Bird he goes completely bonkers. Morning, afternoon and night. I can even have him fetch the feather unit unattached to the string as toy. So far this IS the toy to have."
1,pic shows three puffs scam!,"i ordered feather refills no problems w that along w thati ordered 2 of the cat puff toy (pic shows 3 items per order )thinking i would rec a total of six. paid 7.40 and rec'd only one puff ballpic showed three puffs for the price of 3.70. totally disappointed.nowhere on this site does it state u get one for that price.but then they jst send me one!!! thought maybe they had to back order the otherhave not rec""d item or rec'd an email.so for 7.40 i rec""d one yes one puff toyi am waiting for a reply.thinking of informing amazon of how misleadingproduct quanity adverisement is of this productanyways i jst want product or money for item notrec'd.n for future cust to note u get 1 not 3and shipper pron to quanity error n shipping"
3,Good for the price,"This kids overall is good for the price. Quality is satisfactory. The only problem is that it has very strange smell- as if item had been stored in not very dry premises for a long time. Several washes didn't help to get rid of it.Besides, flat shipping cost of $ 10 really doubles cost of item."
2,Did not read anywhere that this was not a sealed unit,"I thought I had ordered a ""sealed"" unit, meaning there would be no holes in the pipe. Had I read anywhere in the product information that was the case, I would not have ordered the item."
1,The Stair Joke Video,"I believe I was the first and only one to purchase, November of 2008, this video, and the stair block tool that is offered on his website. This video is an absolute joke! Nothing of substance and just a bunch of amateur jokes with the crew that help him make the video. It is not even a good candidatie for worst home movie of the decade. I still have my video and stair block, and each time I look at them I remind myself of the day I was the worlds biggest sucker for a gimmick. This man should be banned from all construction sites, reputable tool and hardware stores, and from even using the internet to view reputable sites related to woodworking of any kind."
2,Still not enough to really help a person in need,"If you are looking for a good book and are trying to understand your spirituality, you must read, The New Dance Of Christ by Anthony T. Massimini.Take it from one who has read all of Pecks books and many other, besides. You won't find what you are looking for until you read The New Dance of Christ. I'm telling you, this will change your life..."
4,Further Along The Road Less Traveled,I had read The Road Less Traveled and loved it and this sequel did not disappoint me. Scott Peck is a talented writer and writes pure common sense added to spirituality. How refreshing!
3,The Comback Begins Here,"Cheap Trick recruited metal producer Jack Douglas to toughen up the sound after the lackluster ""Next Position Please."" The overall presence of ""Standing On The Edge"" is much meatier than its two predecessors but the great songs are lacking here. All of that can be forgiven, however, by the fantastic near miss single ""Tonight It's You."" Had their record label cared (note that Rick Nielsen's name is misspelled on the album sleeve, that should give you a clue as to how much Epic was - at the time - still interested in Cheap Trick), ""Tonight It's You"" might have been the hit that waited until ""The Flame."""
3,Mixed Trick,"There is a lot of debate on the CT website about whether or not these Wounded Bird reissues are remastered, and while I'm not enough of an audiophile to make a definitive case one way or another, I can say that this version of ""Standing On The Edge"" sounds markedly better than the original CBS release: the album sounds louder, fuller, and possesses more depth all around. Also, there is no tape hiss evident on this release. Unfortunately, this is not the Trick's finest musical moment, as there is lots of gimmicky mid-80s production throughout and a few sub-par songwriting attempts to compete with then-popular hair bands and techno pop acts (""Rock All Night,"" ""Love Comes.""). However, the album includes four genuine CT classics in ""Tonight It's You,"" ""This Time Around,"" Cover Girl,"" and the title track, the latter of which has never before been avaiable in a version that sounds this good. Well worth the $12 price for completists looking to upgrade."
5,just like physical conditioning but mental,"I've been listening to this audio pretty much daily for 3 months or so. Whenever I get the chance I take a listen because it's a great way to get some extra rest/sleep. After a couple of weeks I noticed ideas coming into my thoughts automatically. I also noticed that I started living the way this audio was conditioning me to live...to reach more of my potential and to realized that my full potential is tremendous. I believe it's a lot like physical conditioning. You need to do it pretty much daily and if you do, you will see gradual success. This seems to be a way to automatically reprogram any bad conditioning you've picked up along the way. I've been with my company and in the same position for four years and after listening to this program for about 2 months I got a promotion. Coincidence?"
3,BEWARE!,"This really is an excellent routine and Rod Stryker is a great instructor, HOWEVER, Gaiam is selling the same routine under 2 different names and different packaging. So, if you have bought the longevity workout and see peak performance in a store, dont buy it! Also, the back of the DVD claims that Rod Stryker is the only student of Mani Finger's to receive yogiraj status, but I know Alan Finger (Mani's son) received that status well before Rod. I know because I received my certification under Alan. The routine itself gets 5 stars, but the shady marketing takes away from that."
3,ring,the ring seems to be of good quality and not too heavy to wear. the ring size (9) is smaller than other rings I have in size 9. also thought the 'top side' of the ring looked bigger in the picture than it is.
5,Replacement Cartridge,Looks and works like a new OEM cartridge. Recommend this source for all HP inkjet replacement needs.Very happy camper here.
5,Just what I needed.,I do alot of printing at home and sometimes I don't have the time to scramble to a store to purchase my ink. This remanufactured one came fast and did it's job. Thanks.
3,More distressing,"Got this belt for my fiance for Christmas. He wears it a couple of times a week with a cool batman belt buckle, and it looked pretty bada$$ to begin with. Since, (and this is march, so three months of wear) the belt is beginning to look about worn out. I think by June, it will have had it. I guess you get what you pay for, but I ordered another belt with a comparable price and it still looks new. Won't be buying this again."
5,Shuffle board,"I was very satisfied with the shuffle board product. I was a bit worried at first, because I have played on an actual sized shuffle board and was worried this product would not have the same feel or fun factor, but honestly I have had a great deal of enjoyment and fun with the product. It's a great item to have for house parties or just get togethers with friends. The board was well put together and the wood finish and paint job was superb! The board came well packed and protected. And finally the pucks are well designed as well and durable. The mini pucks have a plastic ring around a steel baron to glide across the board, which it does very well. And the plastic ring is great when bumping other players pucks off the board and from points. For 40 dollars you can't go wrong with the item and it fits on top of a dinner table easily."
5,Great toy,Great gift! Built well and hours of fun for all! We loved it so much we bought another for a gift.
1,not very good,This was not well made. The pieces did not slide well. My kids were bored of it in 10 minutes. I returned it.
2,Magnets not strong,"I would have given this only 1 star, except we've found a way to put the whiteboard up on the back of the locker so that she can still see/use it.If you put it on the inside of the door (as most people would do) each and every time the door is closed, no matter how gently (which, it would be kind of ridiculous to think a 7th grade girl is going to carefully and gently latch her door each time) still sends the whiteboard flying off of the metal, and onto the heap of books and other debris mounded inside. (See myLocker Revolution Locker Adjust-a-Shelf, Colors May Vary (05021)review of that piece of crap)"
5,Does the job!,"And the picture is very deceiving for this eye wear. They are very dark, yet light enough to still be able to see thru them and still be protected."
2,basically boring,"commenting on the uk version. i've only watched the first two episodes, but unless this show gets spectacularly better from the 3rd episode on, it is highly overrated. it's just very lackluster, with a plot hardly good enough to carry even the best characters through. and these are not very good characters. they're not terrible, but they're not anything noteworthy, either. their emotions are a bit canned. it's also unpleasant to watch at times because of vulgarity. overall a letdown because i had heard so many great things about it."
1,Not too friendly to the GLBT crowd,"Not too friendly to the GLBT crowd. dialogue like, ""that's gay"" with other references tantamount that being gay is odd"
5,Fabulous Series,This is by far better than the American version. The characters keep you watching week after week. I highly recommend this series!
5,Best series of its kind!,"I will admit that I love everything vampire and werewolf (and I'm almost 40!), but I've gotten very tired of the insipid teeny-bopper shows that have less depth than a sheet of typing paper. Being Human deals with grown up issues and speaks to the angst of my generation. Very intelligent writing that utilizes subtle humor well and creates complex relationships that the viewer wants to be a part of!"
5,A Fantastic ReVamp of the British Original!,"When SYFY channel first announced that they were remaking the BBC's Being Human, I was skeptical. Many American versions of successful British programs fail miserably, and I was a big fan of Being Human. Once it was released, however, I was completely sold. The stories are more exciting, the cinematography is better, and the special effects are fantastic. I knew right away that I would be purchasing the Blu-ray of this series to watch again and share with friends. I was not disappointed.If you are a fan of Vampires, Werewolves, or Ghosts, this series is sure to have something you'll enjoy."
1,Had to return twice!,"This was my first MP3 and I was really excited me and a co-worked purchased the same type. Within two weeks it stopped playing. It would start, but wouldn't stop, go to next song, or anything! I returned it to Walmart and got the same one thinking it was a defect, well the second one did the same thing within two weeks again. I called RCA customer service and all they could say was maybe the batch was bad, because they don't have any problems with the product. My co-workers still works, but she doesn't use hers like I used mine."
2,"Great player, but has some problems.","I have a RCA Lyra RD1076A Mp3 player. The design is the same as the RD1076, just more memory. It worked great when I first got it (about a year ago)but, now I'm running into an internal memory problem where it will only hold around 20 songs. Yes, it does jam up from time to time, but new batteries fix that problem. Try as I might, after getting a memory card for it, I could never get it to play the songs on the memory card. Also, if you need the manual for the player,you have to find it online.Help troubleshooting? Forget about it. That's why I rate this product with only two stars."
3,RCA Lyra,"This product is great for listening to music, but the headphones that it was shipped with were trash. I bought 3 MP3 players and threw all the head sets away. I recommend this Mp3 player because it has a SD card exspation slot. It is easy to use and transfer music, if you have musicmatch you don't need to load the cd that comes with the player. The thing I like most about this product is that it uses 1 ""AAA"" battery that lasts forever, but be prepared to purchase new headphones."
3,British/American Laguage Dictionary,"I was disappointed in this book. I was looking for help in writing a story set in England in 1860. This was not too much help. A language dictionary usually has an equivilant of the same word in the other language. I expected to look up an American word and find the British word. All I got was a definition of the American word without the British equivilent. I can look up definitions of Amereican words in most any dictionary I already have. He did somewhat better in converting British words to American. I think there is room for someone to write a British/ American dictionary like the French/English and Spanish/ English dictionaries I now own. Sorry, Mister Moss. Maybe I'll find the difference between pantalettes, drawers, bloomers, undies and knickers somewhere, but not in your book."
3,A Modern Supplement to your Classic Books,"There are many standard drinks that aren't mentioned in this book, and some of the recipes are sweeter than I'd expect. But it's a good guide to the current state of the cocktail - The index list a hundred different ""Martinis""; your classic book has seven at most."
2,My cats could care less,"My cats took one look at this DVD and found something else to do. I had the feeling they would not like it as they are never interested in the TV, mirrors, phones or anything like that. If your cat shows any interest in TV, perhaps they will love the DVD...my cats just didn't. It was too bad, I was looking forward to watching them paw at the TV:)"
4,Fascinates my older cat; kitten not interested,"I bought this DVD as I felt guilty leaving my kitten and 6 year old cat alone for an entire day sometimes. I've played it about 3 times for them on a continuous loop. I observed them to see if they were interested. My kitty pays no attention. My cat isn't interested in the first part (mice?), but pays intense attention beginning with the birds. In fact, he's tried to climb up 'into' the computer (lol) to get to them, and accidentally set it to something else! Now he doesn't do that, but he's definitely into it for a while. I think it was a good buy and feel better that I've given him something interesting while I'm gone."
1,BEWARE! - My Cat Attacked Me After Watching THis DVD,"Although my cat was very interested in watching all the critters on this DVD, I was pleased at first that he took such an interest. The next day, I left the DVD on Loop while I was away at work for over 9 hours. When I returned later that evening, within minutes, he aggressively attacked me--scratching my legs and foot and viciously biting my hand and arm. I was shocked at his ferocious behavior, and quite frankly, became frightened of this usually docile, male, neutered indoor house cat that I adopted from a shelter over 2 1/2 years ago. I had to run from the room and shut the door to escape his attack. He has NEVER acted like that in the past and I can only attritube this behavior from becoming OVER-stimulated, and perhaps frustrated, from watching and hearing all the critters on this DVD and not being able to interact with them. I have no other explanation -- so BEWARE! No where on this DVD, does it meaning a warning of this sort!"
1,Not for all cats I guess.,"My Burmese cat was not the least bit captivated, either by the sounds or images."
4,Dragonball - First of the Triology,"You will just love this set. I gave it four stars because it was censored to much so it looks like a kid show, as Dragonball, DBZ, and DBGT are targeted to adults 18 and over, but this is still a very enjoyable tape to watch. Unlike Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT, Dragonball gives more information, so that later in the series, there can be a lot of action scenes without people getting confused. This set has all the Dragonball tapes that FUNimation dubbed, about 1/4 of the episodes are here, all the English ones. I watched Dragonball on Fox a long time ago, and I still watch it now, as it's still better than watching DBZ crap that Funimation did on UPN and Cartoon Network. Get this set!"
2,English only DVD,"While this DVD lists that it has Spanish and English subtitles, what it doesn't list is that it is only in English for the audio. Truly a fantastic story, great anime, but make sure you're looking for the dubbed version and not the japanese original version when you buy this."
5,very good shape and will buy from again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a good, box set, will look for for the rest of the series and hope this person has them!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Why this release is edited (and getting bad/angry reviews):,"These episodes were dubbed/edited before Funimation got the rights to the series. They have since redone the dubs and prepared an unedited DVD, but it has only been relased in Australia. Funimation cannot release their DVD in the US until the other company (Kidmark?) relinquishes the publishing rights.I'd recommend you buy up all the Funimation releases first. Then, if you really need to complete the collection, go ahead and pick up this version. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Funimation will eventually get to release their version here."
3,Unrated Does Not Mean Uncut,"When I was searching for the Dragon Ball sagas on DVD, I was only trying to find the uncut editions of the episodes. When I saw that this said unrated i figured that meant uncut. Sorry to say that these were edited and it was like I was 13 all over again. After seeing the uncut episodes this DVD just did not compare. If you have kids it would be great for them due to the fact that some of the content was a little risque for children."
3,Great Buy if you don't mind the editing,"This dvd covers the first 13 episodes of Dragon Ball. It is very funny and begins the buildup of the characters for Dragon Ball-Z later on. I enjoyed these episodes, but was disappointed that an unedited version was not available. There are many funny jokes that are cut out, to make this appropriate for very young viewers. As of yet Funimation and Pinoneer still do not get it that Dragon Ball and the later series were not intended for just little kids. There editing has destroyed the humor Akira Toriyama originally intended. The English dubbing is pretty good though, with some of the voices that occur later on in Dragon Ball Z. I only wish that they could have made an unedited version, because the best of this dvd is cut out."
3,I thought this was an ok Dragonball,"Ok I will admit I am 13, and started watching the later sagas of DBZ instead of most people who watched the first series and then the beginings of DBZ. So I bought this set to watch to sort of fill me in on what happened during Dragonball (the flash backs in DBZ dont tell much). First of all until I got it home and watched it I had no idea that it was edited, I ould have preferred unedited but I said ok so what it is edited. I watched it and found that it wasn't as funny as DBZ was, I am not much for toilet humor and the funniest part was the part where Bulma gives Goku a bath and then Goku walks in on Bulma while she is taking a bath in episode 1. Sence I have purchased this set I have only watched it once, maybe a few episodes twice. All in all, I hated it and do recomend it for younger kids who like the ""fart"" and ""poop"" jokes. For the 12+ catagory just steer clear."
5,"Great Box-Set, but it is on DVD for LESS","This box-set takes you through the first Dragon Ball quest and introduces you to all the gang. The movie is just a pile of piddly crap...it is the first 13 episodes with a few minor changes that are stupid and neglect some important events in the Dragon Ball Series. For those of you considering a purchase of this video set, you should know that it is on a DVD set for cheap. I got the set for $21.00 on DVD from Suncoast Video, and it is a lot cleaner thant the video version. So if you want to save money and want it on DVD it is out there just keep looking."
4,Perfect gift for my wife....,... who has worn out 2 cassette tapes of this soundtrack and was convinced that it was not available on CD. Bought it <shipping was fast> ripped it to my mp3 NAS box and woke her up Christmas Morning with The Duel as loud as the home theater would go. Priceless
5,Delighted,"""Electric Dreams"" is one of my favorite movies. I was delighted to be able to purchase the soundtrack."
3,Good product,It only had a few songs I like which happens with CDs. I would recommend this to someone who likes mellow music.
4,Glad I found it,"I've been trying to replace my dvd recorder with a compatible one so I didn't have to change up my whole wiring system with my tv, receiver, vcr and game system. Amazon was the only place I could find one.Thanks"
1,Tough to carry in and out of car.,"While the unit does a good job holding a variety of stuff, it is a pain to carry from car to house and visa versa. The carrying handles on the two sides of the unit are so far apart that it would be impossible to carry with one hand. I improvised a shoulder strap to assist when I'm juggling keys and a coffee mug, but it was still rather ungainly due to its width. I sent it back."
5,Smells and tastes so good you almost want to eat this coconut oil all by itself!,"If you're in the market for some extra virgin organic coconut oil, this is the product you've been looking for. What really makes Jarrow stand out is it actually smells and tastes like coconut. Some of the coconut oils that have been highly processed lose that good coconut flavor. My first thought after opening the jar is that this smells and tastes so good I could almost eat this all by itself!My only gripe is that the jar was a bit hard to initially get open as there is a plastic ring securing the lid in order to make it tamper resistant. My wife was a bit frustrated by this, so she asked me to open it. Displaying my He-Man-like strength, I had it open in no time! Once you get the lid off, you'll have to remove a foil seal as well.I can't wait to taste the fabulous dishes my wife makes with Jarrow coconut oil.P.S. Remember to refrigerate after opening."
5,Excellent,I have been using Coconut oil for quite some time. This is an excellent brand. To t ell the truth IO find they are all very good. I am currently testing two jars of the same brand but one is organic and one is not.I also opened the two I have at home one was already being used and the other I opened. They are all the same tome. Light flavorful and smooth. I find they are both ones that I would used for myself and I also use it for my dog. Dogs especially love the taste of Coconut oil but be careful you must start with a very small amount and work your way up to a tablespoon or two and an be given daily it helps with coat and when rubbed into the eye area it helps keep away fungal infections...I also use this oil for my skin nails and hair..
4,Jarrow Coconut Oil,"We use coconut oil for many things in our house. I like the taste and consistency of this one by Jarrow and I will order more when I'm out of this jar. We use it for cooking, massage, as a treatment for dry hair, nails, skin and lips and we give it to our dogs for their skin too (both by eating it and massaging it into their skin).Vegan, organic, product of the Phillipines, gluten-free."
3,Not the best I've read,"I bought this book because of the cover. That's why you should believe that saying, ""Never judge a book by it's cover."" There are some very erotic stories in here, I think Emerald is the best one. But some stories are not even erotic and do not go into much detail as I would of preferred."
2,Kama Sutra of Sexual Positions: The Tantric Art of Love,"I wish I hadn't ordered it! I have seen soooo many Kama Sutra books that are sooo much better. This book is very small, short, brief. Not very informative. It is a mix of the most basic things that everyone already does and crazy stuff that only a Yoga master could achieve or even want to try to position themselves into achieving... The only thing good about this book are the drawings, some of the art is nothing special, but there is one illustrator who is very excellent. So from an artistic standpoint, if you want to look at pencil drawings of naked, average-looking people having sex... well it is a good source for that and that alone. Don't buy it to learn anything about sex though!"
4,Lovely Lessons,"Celebrating sex as a way to create harmony and joy, Kenneth Ray Stubbs' Kama Sutra of Sexual Positions is a beautifully designed, artistic manual interspersed with historical and cultural perspectives. The book's colorful images are complemented by poetry, spiritual insights and philosophical material, making for a literate, informative read. But it's the illustrations of ancient lovers and contemporary sex partners showing amazing varieties of lovemaking that are the heart of the Kama Sutra of Sexual Positions. Of all the positive elements of the book, its best are the illustrations of everyday people, making the pleasures of eroticism accessible to all. It's totally refreshing to see sexuality expressed by real men and women instead of surgically enhanced porn stars."
3,snoozer,"Interesting historical information and beautiful imagery...but, no/minimal verbal instructions are given and most positions shown are completely unreasonable to ask of the typical person's body anyway! Geered more toward yoga expert's who are visually-oriented learners. Quite disappointing as an instructional manual and very boring reading."
1,Not worth it,"A very brief book, which used the word ""kamasutra"" but I have the feelings that author did not understood the complete meaning. After wasting money on this, got some books from local library, and realised how super ficial this book was !!!The illustrations are not worth mentioning. Two thumbs down"
1,NO GOOD,Not worth it. It is illustrated like a comic book. The wording is almost impossible to match to the pictures. Don't buy.
4,"A ""Must Read""","If you like the Amelia Peabody books, you must read this one. It gets somewhat complex with spies, counterspies, etc. but I could not put it down. Not only that, I was deeply moved (okay, to tears) by the end of the book---and I am a prosaic, pragmatic person.I am impressed by the depth and quality of Ms. Peters' characterizations as well as her fine eye for historical detail."
5,Great Volume in a Great series,"I began reading the Amelia Peabody series in the middle with Hippopotamus Pool. I figured I would not be as attached to the characters if I had read them from the beginning. But I was wrong. Each book brings a certain maternal feeling as Ramses has grown up in each book. He Shall Thunder in the Sky is the book where Ramses is no longer just part of the plot, he is an integral part of the story. Not that he wasn't before, but an omniscent view of his escapades added to his mother's ""journals"" make for a more involved and evolved story. Elizabeth Peters has done a wonderful job bringing the Emerson family to life, and I can see the series going on for years."
2,He Shall Thunder in the Sky Not All it Could Be,"I must agree with some of the reviews on this book. Having read all of Elizabeth Peters', Amelia Peabody series, this book is definitely lacking in content and sometimes uninteresting. There is very little in the way of Egyptology going on, and seldon does she refer or even go into detail about the archaeological excavations & sites they set out on in the past. It is vague, but finally in the last 10 pages Ramses & Nefret come together romantically and a shocker is revealed to all about Sethos! Definitely not her best and is lacking the Egyptological descriptions, setting, mystery and adventure I used to read her books for. I am very glad I purchased this one used."
4,MY review of The New Years Party,"I thought that this book was very suspenceful. The characters were very easy to relate to, however the plot wasn't. I have never been in a situation near death so it was very shocking to see everything that was happening. This story was fun to read because it had parallel plotting. There were two different stories that led up to one suprising conclusion! The book is scary, but kind of like a mystery because you have to recognize who the characters are and what they play in the murders that occured. Overall, I think it was a very good book and I enjoyed reading it."
5,how to buy jewelry wholesale,"This book is a must, you will never buy jewelry in a retail store again, I learned how to value and get the best price for jewelry. What an insight!"
4,Otis Spofford,"This story is cute. Otis is almost like one of my goofy friends. This was an awesome story.However, there's one thing I feel confused about. The kids in this book are 3rd graders, yet they act like they're so much older than that. Truthfully, I can't see 3rd graders doing what Otis Spofford and Ellen Tebbits and Austin Allen do. Maybe it's just ""nowadays"" that 3rd graders are childish. I don't know. Anywho, you'll like this story if you read it, despite the age problems. The way they acted I think Otis should've been at least ten years old. And I've also noticed that Beverly Cleary has written books for children eight years old, for teens fifteen yeasr old, but NOTHING IN BETWEEN!! I am twelve, and feel like Cleary excludes us tweens.OH well, you like this story anyway."
2,What happened to REAL country music?,"It truly is a dying species. You know the CM industry is headed for a downward, competitive spiral when the top sellers are jingoistic one-hit wonders. Two stars."
1,Darryl has forgotten,I think it's funny that absolutely everything Darryl claims in this song has since been proven to either be false or a lie. I hope Darryl doesn't forget that.
3,Darryl Worley,"I heard the title song while driving recently - I'm not a country music fan. During 9/11, my office looked out on the north tower of the WTC asnd we witnessed only a few hundred yards away, our fellow citizens jumping to their deaths. Tears began rolling down my face, as it brought back to me what happened, and our abysmal response, especially when compared with our response 12/7 60 years earlier.I like the album, but I can't say Worley's voice grabs me particularly. I admire him for putting out a patriotic song for this war against Islamic jihadist terrorism - I wish more artists would do so."
1,Simpleton's Music,"...corny country music with jingoistic, close-minded sentiments and the most blatantly corporate appeal you can imagine (it was rushed to get on the pretentious 9/11 bandwagon). Avoid at all costs."
1,"No, I have not","While im proud to live in America, im not proud of 9/11. It took everyone by surprise and made lots of people money. Think of all the people selling 9/11 bumper stickers and shirts. Does the money actully go to chairty or pocket? Then think of all the country acts that make songs about how tragic this accident was and make millions on it. Alan Jackson, Toby Keith, Darryl Worley are just a few names who all cashed in on 9/11. I love America but im not going write a song about it or buy a bumper sticker that says 9/11 on it."
1,"Darryl, have YOU forgotten?","Darryl, have YOU forgotten that Bin Laden and his buddies were trained by the CIA? That Saddam Hussein was AGAINST a fundamentalist Islamic state as much as you are? That no WMDs have been found in Iraq? That the WMDs we know they DID have in the 1980s were bought from your government and those of other Western states? That when Saddam used these WMDs on his own people, your government stood idly by? That the only government with enough WMDs to destroy the world, and the collective stupidity to use them, is your own? That the best way to stop Bin Laden is to pull your troops out of Saudi Arabia, the home of Islam's most sacred sites? That 20-year-old Americans are dying in Iraq everyday just so the gas you pump into your two-ton pickup can cost half-a-cent less per gallon?"
1,Lunacharsky said it best...,"No, Darryl, I haven't forgotten. Nor have I forgotten that wonderful scene in ""Wag The Dog"" where Willie Nelson (who can still outsing you, buddy) is commissioned to write a song just like yours to convince decent Americans to support another indecent war. To quote a past master of the game: ""Art is a powerful means of infecting those around us with ideas, feelings and moods. Agitation and propaganda acquire particular acuity and effectiveness when they are clothed in the attractive and mighty forms of art."" Anatoly Lunacharsky, Lenin's Commissar of Public Education, c.1918."
1,More Lame lyrics,"""have you forgotten"" is just another attempt by a country music singer to cash in on the 9/11 tragedy...another ""toby keith"" wannabe who is using the incident to jump start and career and sell cds.Someone said this song was a career risk. Give me a break! This is the kind of song country music fans will buy, but make no mistake about it was written to start a career. It would have been more of a risk to write a song against the war and be a country music artist."
5,richard simmons and the silver foxes,this is a great exercise dvd for those of us that need to start slow. it gives a great workout with minimal jaring of the body. I would highly recommend it.
5,Silver Foxes DVD,This is a great DVD workout/exercise for those of us 50 and over! My sister and I both love it.
3,"A tongue-in-cheek, cutesy novel...","Based on the reviews, I expected to read an excitement filled, humorous novel. The humor was there -- to some degree, but the excitement wasn't. It was a decent read, but it's not one I could pick up again."
1,awful cell phone,"Doesn't matter if its free....this phone is trash....it is primarily designed to get you to run the cost meter on the internet...nothing more... screen times out in seconds, hard to read in sunlight, and contrary to the manual it is neither user friendly or intuitive...I have an older black and white screen Nokia ""shorty"" that runs circles around this phone. Good luck."
4,3 out of 3...Keep up the good work,"The Sly Cooper Series has lived up to it's expectations. Ever since the first one (which I got for my then 9 year old cousin as an alternative to GTA and the likes but got hooked when he asked me to help him with certain levels). They've consistently brought out fun, G-rated games that even the ""older kids"" can play at a really good price!"
5,The Magnificent Sly three,A wonderful magnificent challenging game. Great Graphics and one that keeps you on your toes...I have played Sly 2-Band Of thieves and Sly cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus also and they are all great...I will play the next one they put out...
2,The end of a downhill slide,"I am a huge fan of the original Sly Cooper game. While it was not a difficult game, it offered a lot of fun and challenge in the form of lengthy platforming levels. In that game, you could spend several minutes smoothly running through the levels jumping, swinging and shimmying among the obstacles. In Sly 2, this model was thrown away for a more GTA-inspired mission-based model. Missions had less platforming and were often short and just plain boring. In Sly 3, all that was good about Sly is gone. The missions are very short and often pointless. There is very little good platforming. The only positive parts of the game are the art, humor and story. If you are looking for a fun platforming experience, give this one a pass and pick up one of the Ratchet games or Psychonauts."
4,Just Great,"Everything I expected. Just a little shorter than my mat, and I have a standard sized mat but otherwise good deal."
5,Great yoga towel,This is a great yoga towel. Fits perfectly over the yoga mat and soaks up a ton of sweat without getting slippery. Little nubs on the back of the towel keep it place during the class. A bikram yoga must have.
2,yogietoes skidless mat,"I followed the instructions and washed the mat 2 times before using. It still bled after 6! I stopped counting then. I now have pale blue towels, underwear and yoga tops! Good thing I washed it only my yoga clothes."
2,I'm slipping and sliding.,I read many reviews on this product and seen it in use by many fellow yogis in my classes. I bought one enthusiastically. I'm quite disappointed actually. I slip and slid on it A LOT. It is better just to use my mat straight. The silicone side doesn't slip but my hands and feet slip on the towel surface. I pour water on it to increase traction and it does help. It is hard because I don't want my entire towel wet just where I put my hands and feet and often times I don't have a large enough area. Also - I've heard washing it increases its traction so I haven't had many cycles of washes yet. I may alter my review in the future if washing it does seem to help. Otherwise - it doesn't work for me :-<
4,Good for yogis who have trouble with slipery mats (or sweaty hands)!,I practice yoga daily and regularly attend Bikram classes. The Yogitoes towel has been a great tool to stop slipping off my mat during sweaty classes. The towel does move around a bit but it is not difficult to readjust. My only piece of advice would be to choose a color besides the white which quickly discolors and stains with use.
4,Enjoy the product!,I am satisfied with the Yogitoes towel. It is a bit pricey but I think it is worth it if it's used often. I am using it for Hot Yoga and it does a great job of soaking up my sweat and not slipping on my yoga mat. I just throw it in the wash after each Hot Yoga session and so far so good.
5,VERY GOOD PRODUCT,"COULD NOT PRACTICE HOT YOGA WITHOUT THIS TOWELPERFECTLY MADE FOR YOGAFITS NICE ON MATFADES AND BLEEDS IN WASH, NOT SURE WHY, BUT WILL STOP I ASSUME"
5,Great on carpet!,"Initially, I bought this because the palms of my hands and feet get a bit sweaty during yoga. I had been using a towel and didn't like that because of the fabric--it was still causing me to slide a bit. I really liked this when I got it because of the feel--I don't slide around the microfiber much. I liked it so much I got a second one to alternate between classes. They're nearly one year old and they've held up quite well.I use them a lot in my new carpeted place and they work great. It sticks well to carpet and I like having the towel as a reference point during sun salutations. My carpeting is a little firm, so I don't have balance problem. Great product--totally worth it!"
2,way too overpriced for what it's worth,"The towel is made of a very soft and noticeably good quality material. However, at $50 (!!!) it really isn't worth it. I bought one because I thought it HAD to be amazing, since so many people have bought it and it has so many good reviews. But I found myself very unimpressed with it. It's worth maybe $25 for what it does. I also found myself slipping easily since the towel material is very soft and smooth."
4,great towel,What can I say--it's a towel. The non-skid feature is great for yoga. Seems a little pricey but I couldn't find it for less anywhere else.
3,Good product but irregular-not a first,Yogitoes are great towels if you do hot yoga and even thought this one wasn't straight across the top it works just fine. They are great in the washer and dryer on low and don't seem to hold any sort of smells which is great. The traction side keeps the towel in place over your yoga mat which is why it's worth it to buy this towel. Bright colors can be distracting and the white one looks DISGUSTING eventually so choose wisely! I have no idea why people by the smaller handtowel version but maybe there is something I'm missing on that one. The point is the traction with your mat.
5,yogitoes pink,"yogi toes skidless towel has changed my yoga practice. I no longer slip and slide, and don't waste extra energy just trying to stay put on the mat. I love the limited edition pink towel; the color is bright and cheers me up."
3,Skidless towel,"Great idea. Great product. Doesn't always work for me.However, I know other yogi's who swear by it.And yes, I would buy it again. Because when it does work for me it is a life saver."
3,A little disappointing,"Although the product came very quickly and in great condition, it did not function like thought it would. Maybe I need to keep working on how to place it, but it does not stay put on my yoga mat very well. It moves around when my feet move and every time i am in downward facing dog I find myself kicking it back into place from where it has run up on the mat and wrinkled. It mostly serves the purpose of having a layer between me and my mat."
5,"Liona,THE BEST","This music has given me great joy..How wonderful to be transported to a world that only great music can bring. Liona,you never disappoint."
2,Non Liona fans proceed with caution,"Boy I hate to spoil the party but... I heard a little bit of Liona on TV years ago and thought her tone and execution were wonderful. The strengths she reveals here are tremeandous speed and accuracy, astounding really. But her interpretation is shallow and sometimes plain odd. Her own compositions are occasionally even corny. The tone, perhaps due to the recording EQ, is almost metallic, making her strings sound more like steel than nylon and metal wound nylon. If you already love Liona, go for it, but others proceed with caution."
3,Classical Solo Guitar,"When I purchased Liona's 'Camino Latina' album, I loved it so much, I thought I'd give this one a try. With a title 'The Spanish Album', I thought it might be similar. I was wrong. This album is solo classical guitar.. no background music accompaniment.If you a guitar student, you might like her intricate, detailed playing.But probably not a good choice for the average listener who is looking for some pleasant easy listening music. To me, the music just sounds dark and drab... Personally, I prefer the 'nuevo flamenco' sound, with the percussion and backup music with bass and maybe some flute, and most importantly, with a pleasant, upbeat melody... more like Liona's Camino Latina album, which I highly recommend."
5,Un-F***ing believable,I had never heard of this chick until I started Flamenco lessons. All I can say is WOW!!!
3,Blazing bronze,"This German group was already well on its way to establishing their signature glitch-fusion pop, which would lead to breakout success with '02's Neon Golden, on this prior '98 release. Shrink obviously does not have the extensive production efforts found in further albums, but is quite solid in an understated way."
5,Great.,I'm student of Electronic Engineering. This a very useful book in speech recognition and procesing. The flowcharts and well detailed examples explain how these electronics devices can be applied to hi-tech projects.
5,Bestec ATX - 1956F Power supply,Perfect and exact replacement for my faulty power supply. Easy installation. Worked as soon as I turned it on. Couldn't be more pleased.
5,Sweet,Like the hat this picture is not misleading what you see is what you get . love it ghost in the shell Stand alone complex : 2nd Gig
2,Awful Fit. Not close to accurate measurements,"While the fabric is all it is advertised to be, and they look great out of the box, the inseam fit is so far off base, it makes me question whether the good people at Mountain Khaki are using different units of measurement than everyone else. My 30"" inseam pants arrived no less than two inches too long. Perhaps Mountain Khaki needs to find another under-developed county in which to produce their clothing. Back you go....."
3,mk pants,very pricey for not offering different inseam by the time I got it back from alterations you can add a $20
1,Don't believe the hype...,"Don't fall for the marketing Mountain Khakis uses on these pants. Their quality control is horrible. Three pairs of these later, and they all fit differently despite being the same size. On the one pair I didn't return, the seam holding the patch over one knee started to unravel because the stitching was loose. I have returned or sold off all of them, and switched to Arborwear. If you want to see a quality pair of heavy duty canvas pants that actually fit consistently, and don't make you look like you are wearing an adult diaper, look into the Original Tree Climbers Pant from Arborwear. You won't be disappointed."
4,An excellent live Moody Blues concert,"This is an excellent recording of a live Moody Blues concert. I was at the concert that was recorded and the video accurately captures the excitement of the night. It contains all of their classic favorites with outstanding camerawork. There are close-ups of all the members of the band and occasional audience shots showing their complete involvement. The music is similar to the original recordings (no new arrangements). If you are a Moody Blues fan, this is an must-buy."
3,"Longer track list, but not a patch on Albert Hall DVD","The whole point of music DVD is to enjoy excellent sound and secondly, great picture quality. I expect surround sound with a music DVD, yet this Moody Blues doesn't deliver this. It only comes with 2.0 stereo. This is disappointing because producers can do tricks and create 5.1 remixes these days, even to the oldest 2 channel soundtracks. Purists may say ""urgh"" to this, but I really don't care.While this DVD boasts a great long tracklist, I strongly urge fans to purchase the far superior ""Moody Blues - Live at Royal Albert Hall"". It was filmed in 2000, and features a totally beautiful DTS surround sound! On top of that, the image is almost crystal clear. Even with its shorter tracklist, it is a much wiser purchase - one which you will return to time and time again to watch! It will also give you what music DVD is supposed to give you - otherwise you may as well hang on to your old HI-FI music videos and live back in the 80's and 90's!"
2,"Okay but ""Canyon"" not good for sound","This was an ""OK"" concert; BUT out in the Red Rock canyon; the sound is displaced. The orchestra sound was just fine; but the Moody Blues themselves were ""not great"" to put it mildly. I AM A HUGE MOODY BLUES FAN; BUT THIS DVD IS NOT THE ONE YOU WANT."
5,Moody Blues at Red Rocks,I have been to several concerts at Red Rocks but this is one I wish I could have gone to. I love the Moody Blues and to see them in concert at this venue would have been a dream come true. I'll have to settle for the dvd. It came in a timely fashion and as advertised by the seller. I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again.
2,High hopes ultimately led to disappointment,"I was led to believe that this book was intended to inspire young readed and spur their interest in poetry. After reading it I can only say that it was a disappointment. I don't believe the editors have the slightest idea what young people are interested in reading. There are a few exceptions that give the collection some redemption, but overall I doubt that youngsters will be anything but bored."
4,Can't afford to ignore it!,"Exceptionally detailed, very easy to follow, doesn't leave much to be desired as far as guide books go. One thing that would have made it better is a Stockholm underground map."
2,Should Focus Less on Politics and More On Places,"Personally I think that this book should have focused more on pictures of the area - buildings, businesses, places, landscape, etc. There are so many things I've heard my parents talk about and a lot of them are not in this book. There are far too many pictures of the same people/families, with a clear favoring of the Ellender family. At times I felt like this was just an Ellender family album. I do realize that the archives were a source for many of the pictures, but for a $20 book perhaps there should have been more research done and contributions from other families should have been solicited, accepted and used."
2,The Midney Factory,"Clearly influenced by the Star Wars movies of his time, Midney was fond of taking bittersweet European-style string melodies and overlaying them with electronic sci-fi burbles, then arranging the songs in dramatic, soundtrack fashion. The results could be beautiful, histrionic, or peculiar. This second USA-European Connection album is better than the boppier, bubblegum first lp, but suffers from third-grade lyrics and Saturday morning cartoon singing."
4,Not sci-fi- but as well crafted as always,"I have to start this by saying I am already a fan of Orson Scott Card's other books, and have read just about everything he's ever written. I also am not religious and normally shy away from books and movie with religious overtones, but I ordered this book by accident off of one of those ""Look your favorite author has a book you don't own"" lists.I was originally disappointed when I found out that the book was based on a bible story, but instead of returning the book I decided to read it. I have to admit that as a story, it was as well written and crafted as any other OSC novel or story has been. While I am in no way religious in my adult life, I am familiar with the basic stories of the bible and liked the depth of the characters not portrayed in other classic bible stories.In the end, even though it was an unexpected OSC book, I appreciated and enjoyed it."
3,"All of Card's empathy, none of his great stories.","Not surprisingly, this book had all the incredible characterization and empathy and human complexity that Card is so good at. Also not surprisingly, there's none of the incredible premises, settings, or plots that he is alos incredibly good at. He makes the biblical story human, but not terribly interesting. And Abraham has the same problem that a lot of his major characters do, he's never uncertian and never wrong in his infinite wisdom. That gets old. In general this was one of my least favorite Card books, but if you love the humanity in his writing more than the creativity, you'll love this."
4,Artful Storytelling,"No matter what genre he chooses, Orson Scott Card can't seem to write a bad novel. Biblical fiction isn't a ""hot"" topic, but after reading ""The Red Tent"" by Anita Diamont, I was curious as to how one of my favorite sci-fi authors would approach such a story.The story of Sarah and her husband Abraham is one I half-heard about in Sunday school as a child. Orson Scott Card brings it vividly to life so that the characters become more than just biblical figures, but real people with real lives, real doubts, and real faith. The book does start slow, but as I read on I found myself appreciating Card's ability to take time with the everyday aspects of Sarah and Abraham's lives rather than focusing entirely on the dramas and miracles of biblical proportion.Regardless of whether or not you agree with Card's basic religious assumptions or his interpretation of Sarah and Abraham's story, this book is still a great example of Card's artful storytelling at its best."
3,"A Truly Magnificent Author, but.......","I get that he doesn't know women so much. I love the way OSC can create characters or bring humanness and depth to real people. His ""Stone Tables"" is one of my favorite novels of all time. Yet in ""Sarah"" I could not relate to her or the other female characters. They seemed paper-thin, weak sometimes, and without passion or deep power. Maybe he didn't go deep enough, or maybe he's caught up in all the patriarchal illusion of the Church. Or maybe he, like many men, doesn't really know women. I couldn't wait to read ""Sarah"" to get to know her. But I found I didn't like her much. I think I'll wait to meet her and the other great women in person. Or write the novel myself.....hmmm!"
3,(3.5) A Biblical woman for the ages,"This historical novel offers an unusual look at the life of a woman from the Old Testament, Sarah, wife of Abraham. Well-researched, the story follows Sarah through her long life, her marriage to Abraham, and how that marriage enriched her life. The difficulties of a shepherd's wife are gratefully accepted and they live in abundance, even in the midst of want. Joined to Abraham, Sarah becomes an integral part of the foundation of the Tribes of Israel."
4,Colorado Rocky Mountain high,A pleasant collection of tunes. Great harmonies with Ricky Skaggs. They don't miss a note. Very clean guitar work by his guests.How quickly time flies.
1,You get what you pay for.,"I bought these studs and they're very pretty, simple and nice. However, they didn't last long. The post came off of one of the earrings and the stone fell out. Not worth even the 14.99. :-("
3,A pretty good debut,I wanted to go back after reading one and start with his first book. I found it OK but not what I would have expected. It had the young lawyer and interestng characters but it seemed to lack something. Even with the surprise ending well done it still left me with a little wonder. He certainly has written many more so I will continue to proceed.
3,I Wanted To Start this Series at the Beginning...,"and so I did, with ""Primary Justice"". And it was OK. And maybe ""pretty OK"" for a first novel. There's enough of interest in here to make me want to continue with at least one more book, but, I tend to agree with ""a reader from San Antonio"" (see review following mine), that there is a lot to be desired in plot and writing style. Rough around the edges; let's see if he can develop the characters better in the next go round!"
4,great product,This thermometer replaced a cheaper model made by another company which had stopped working after two years. This device ws easy to set up and has worked perfectly throuigh extremely cold and wet conditions while the outside thermometer is mounted on a tree. It is easy to read and looks good too!
4,A winner,"A sure-fire hit with our 17 month old son, there's no end in sight to the repeat viewings. Nor any end in sight to his delight in watching every segment. It gets four stars rather than five only because it's a little too short"
3,Cute but could be better,"Its interesting, lightly older thou. You can tell by the celeb's in it. But my daughter enjoys it."
2,Not Elmo's BEST,"Agree with the reviewer re the ""guest stars"" in this video. Kids don't care and I don't think this video earns the ""best of"" title. Also, the copy I received freezes up and unfortunately I didn't sit down and make sure it worked before I threw the shipping info away and 6 weeks had passed before my grandson watched it. For under $10 not worth the hassle of returning, but you usually get this quality at the swapmeet for $5, not from Amazon. All in all a disappointing purchase. Wiggles is WAAAAAY better....more singing and action, less talk."
5,Elmo's the best,"I got this video for my 18 month old son for Christmas. We have watched it at least 3 times a day ever since. It's a great break for me, because I can get a few things done while he's engrossed in the songs. He loves to ""Happy Tap"" with Elmo. The songs really stick with you, but they're easy on the brain (won't drive you to the insane asylum). I would definitely recommend this for 18 months up to at least 6 (because my 6 year old likes it, too)."
3,This Video Was Boring Compared to the Elmo's World Video,"My 15 month old daughter watches another video called, ""Elmo's World"" and loves it. So, I figured she'd like this video, too. For some reason, it doesn't compare. Call me crazy, but Elmo's voice and the way he looks is different in this video from the Elmo that we see in the Elmo's World video. The Elmo in this video is strange to look at and to listen to, in a bad, boring way. This video doesn't seem to have the energy that some of the other Sesame Street videos have. If you want to see Elmo at his best, get ""Elmo's World""."
4,The Best of Elmo,"Got kids? They like Sesame Street and Elmo? Then this is a MUST. Saves money, by compiling the best scenes and skits all into one dvd. Excellent for buying those precious 30minutes of peace and quiet! =)"
3,The Best of Elmo - Is It Really?,"Although entertaining for the under 5 set, ""The Best of Elmo"" is reasonably dated and mostly shows clips of 'shaggy' Elmo prior to his haircut. This aside there are a plenty of songs for the little one to listen to and a guest appearance from Julia Roberts and Whoopi Goldberg."
5,If you love ELMO,"NOthing more to say other than if you or your child loves ELMO, they're gonna enjoy this DVD. My 3 yr old loves it."
5,Son loves it,"This is a great video and my son loves it. The quality was great and it arrived quickly. The video is a bit short, but overall it is great."
1,Surprisingly disappointed...,"My granddaughter has the Elmo DVD, and I was ready for a change from her favorite, Little Einstein's Huge Adventure, so I put on Elmo. I was so suprised in the harsh voice, chaos, and rude attitude of Elmo after just watching the polite, calm, happy Little Einstein voices. I was trying to settle my granddaughter down for the night, and Elmo made me feel anxious and irritated in less than two minutes, and she was ready to get up and run around again, so it was turned off. I won't put it on again."
5,childrens video,This is a great video teaches little onesall kinds of things. My almost 3 yr old Greatgrand sons{Twins} just love Elmo
