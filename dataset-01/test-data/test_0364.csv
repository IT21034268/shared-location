1,Yuck!!,I hated this album....her voice sounds like something the dogs howl when they hear sirens...she never should have won Idol...and she never should have released a CD like this...YUCK
4,Fantasia's off to a good start...,"Seems like she set out to make a contemporary, R&B popular cd. And she succeeded at making a pretty good one. She's got a true R&B sound that will attract a lot of the older generation. And young, top notch producers that will keep the younger audience as well. The albums content, as far as uniqueness, will not be unprecedented--but it's definitely something you wanna' keep in your cd player. Stand-out tracks: 1.Ain't Gon' Beg You 2.Free Yourself 3.Truth Is 6.Baby Mama (this song was a great idea) 7.Got Me Waiting (even though you can tell Jermaine Dupri produced this one-sounds just like ""BURN"") and 12.This Is Me."
1,horrible worst IDOL,"Kelly had hits, Clay had hits even Ruben had hits, her album was and is a flopp!! The worst Idol seller ever, her 15 minutes is up."
4,SHE PULLED IT OFF!!!!!!,"I LOVE THIS CD! THIS IS A TRUE FRESH ARTIST WHO IS RAW! KUDOS TO YOU FANTASIA!! I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS CD AND THIS IS WHAT I EXPECTED FROM HER. I LOVE HER RASPY VOICE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT SEPERATES HER FROM THE REST OF THE YOUNG FEMALE ARTIST OUT THERE... AND SHE CAN SANG!!! ASHANTI NEEDS TO TAKE LESSONS FROM HER. FANTASIA HAS GOOD PRODUCERS ON THIS CD AND IT'S A VARIETY OF MUSIC. I DO LIKE HER SLOWER BALLADS THE BEST, BUT SHE WILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME.... THIS ""I BELIEVE"""
1,Where is the REAL Fantasia?,"Let me just start by saying that I think this is a pretty good release, especially for her first one. However, I want to know what happened to the REAL Fantasia? After watching her on every show of American Idol, I came to know the wild, in your face, almost Aretha Franklin like quality that Fantasia has. That's what I wanted more of on this CD. This CD is now going in my collection as something to play during a quiet dinner party with my parents. I wanted to hear more life, more energy, more of that Fantasia personality. I'm disappointed that this would be the release she picked to be her ""coming out"" CD.Please next time, MORE LIFE, MORE FANTASIA!!!!"
2,Very Disappointed,"WOW...... I love Fantasia, BUT..... This C.D. was notAs good as when she sang live. What happened? Even""Summertime"" which made me know she was the BEST....On CDwas fast and not soulful.Where did the soulful, haunting Ladygo? I don't think I would have even gave it as gifts andsang her praises if I knew how just everyday it was."
1,"good talent, poor song selection","Fantasia has a beautiful voice-why does she concede to this type of repetitive rap style mess. She needs to showcase her voice, she has such a natural talent, she doesn't need to do all this horrible screeching to be noticed. Sorry lady, you can do better than this."
1,"The most overrated ""singer"" in the world","I'd give this album a zero if that were available. This girl simply can't sing! She has zero voice quality, zero personality, and zero star value. She's so painful to listen to. Her voice is so squeaky, you'd think she's a cat in heat. It's worse watching her on TV, though. Her performance style is very ugly, and her interviews reveal how shallow she is. And this is supposed to be OUR idol??? I'm ashamed to be called American!"
2,Disappointed,"I really did want to like this. Somehow, the power she brought to the Idol stage was lost on this CD. It was just too much of her screaming over background vocals for my ears. I still love to watch her perform. Maybe she's destined to be better in performance than on record. I think the same could be said of some of Tina Turner's music. So that's a compliment really - I just didn't like the CD. Honestly, after five or six listenings, I couldn't even hum one of the tunes (except of course ""Always on My Mind"" & ""Summertime"" - and did we really need another copy of ""I Believe""?) Then there's the ultimate sin -- the songs on the label are in the wrong order! Really irks me when that kind of unprofessional crap happens! Track number 9 through 12 are listed wrong. C'mon girl - get somebody lookin' out for ya'!"
3,"This CD is okay,","I love fantasia and everything don't get me wrong, I only like three songs on this album well, i haven't got the chance to really listen to it! But, i'd give it 3.5 out of 5 (:"
2,just to prove a point. Barrino vs. DeGarmo is OVER,i was gonna give Fantasia 3 stars but since somebody insisted on comparing Diana to Jenny Craig then i insisted that i must lower Fantasias rating 1 star. You are only hurting Fantasia by writing a five star review for her and a one star for Diana; people aren't stupid and nobody takes you seriously. Next time you're gonna bash; try to stop yourself.
3,Bwisit!,"Ito ang pinakapangit na album na narinig ko sa buong buhay ko. Ang pangit ng boses, parang inipit na palaka! Dapat turuang kumanta ang losyang na 'to para hindi kahiya-hiyang pakinggan ang pangit na album ng pangit na ""manganganta"" raw. Whatever!"
1,Hit the snooze button,"The album isn't bad, but it is way short of being good either. This collection is just plain monotonous, and is EXACTLY what I expected from last seasons AI winner. Her voice is good, but way too nasaly, and this album gets very irritating after a couple of plays. Baby Mama has got to be the low point of the album. The subject has been done to death over the last decade and blows this album's credibilty wide open. Perhaps a second album from Fantasia will have a more varied appeal. Will the public buy a second after this disappointing first? Once bitten, twice shy. Fortunately I borrowed the album and was able to hand it back."
2,Paddle boats don't go,"My Dad used to make these for me, and they moved great. These boats are not engineered right. They are too heavy, the boats sit too low in the water, the paddles are not big enough to propel the boat, and there is not enough clearance to wind the rubber band tight enough for a good ride. Maybe I didn't read the fine print carefully enough, but I was disappointed to discover a bag of pieces of wood that needed assembly and painting. For $15. I felt ripped off."
3,tiger,"This tiger was purchased along with a big Melissa and Doug lion for Christmas for my daughters. We also received an additional M&D lion from my parents for Christmas for the girls, meaning we now have 3 large cats at our house. While our 3 girls ranging in ages from 5-10 love their new animals, they are made poorly. Having them in our house for less than 24 hours, one lion was noted fresh out of the box with a hole in his head at the top of his face where his mane meets his face. The tiger has 3 different locations of holes at stitching sites. Also, true to a real cat's nature, they shed tremendous amounts of fur all over my carpets. In addition as I'm sure previous reviewers stated one leg is so much longer than the other front leg looks a little weird. With all this being said, my girls don't mind any of it, and love their new realistic looking big cats. I just wish the stuffing didn't look like it was ready to escape too!"
4,Awesome Tiger; but Beware of Holes in Seams!,"This tiger is so cool! I bought it for my 4yo and she loves it! However, right out of the package, I counted 4 holes in the seams that I had to personally sew up before giving it to her to play with. Since playing with it, I've sewed it up another two times already! So, durability is disappointing. Regardless, I am willing to rate it high because it is the coolest and most realistic looking tiger. It's so much fun for my daughter to play with!"
5,Huge tiger for a little boy!,"I bought this tiger for my 1 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas. I bought him tons of other toys, but the tiger hit the spot. The first thing he did is sit on it and ride it.He giggled and jumped on the tiger every each way, and carries it by the tail, arranges the paws around himself to wrestle and uses it to step up and climb ( which is not always a good thing, but boys will be boys).All in all a very successful gift.Also, the tiger got lost in the shipping process and when I inquired they promptly shipped me one, which was great because it arrived just before Christmas."
5,horrifying and enlightening,"This book will open your eyes. If even a fourth of this book is true--and much of what I have found in other sources validates a lot of what I have read in this one, then we are indeed in a lot of trouble. If you want to know about treason against this country and its people then this book is a good place to start. It was written in 1996, so there was a couple of things that have come out that made a couple of facts questionable, but the vast majority of it seems to be factual. The manipulation of the people into wars, experimentation of them unknowingly, treasonous actions against the country, etc. will curdle your blood. The inhumanity of certain groups is hard to imagine for decent people. I only hope it is not too late for people to wake up and get their acts together. Read this book!"
1,egg case,This might be OK if you can find really small eggs. Our large eggs almost all got broken just trying to snap the case shut!
2,Misleading and unclear,"Terrible item. The pictures show all 8 volumes, yet only recieved 4. Does not say anywhere that it only includes volumes 1-4. Furthermore, after very careful research, the 2nd box set says it only has 3 dics, implying that there is only 3 volumes in it, whereas there should be 4 discs, which are the remaining volumes 5-8."
3,sad,SAD MOVIE OR MAYBE IT WAS JUST MY MOOD BUT I FELT KIND OF DEPRESSED AFTER I WATCHED IT. I LOVE MEYERS TALENT HE CAN PLAY ANY ROLE AND MAKE IT HIS.
4,Not bad for the price,"It is indeed a full size adult helmet. The plastic is made of stronger material than most masks. It is perfect size. I would highly recommend glue or tape to hold it together, as the snaps don't work too well."
1,Dolly on Acid,"I am shaken to the core. I have numerous Dolly Parton CDs and have been a fan for 25 years. One great memory in my life is a camping trip in the early 80s up in the Canadian Rockies and slipping into town to see ""Best Little Whorehouse in Texas."" Trust me, folks, this CD ""Halos and Horns"" is dreadful. I believe it could drive unstable people over the edge. The music is convoluted and Dolly's voice (she sings and 'talks') is competely out of control. She must be taking acid in her old age or something!Since this album is being rated (by 72 people) as above 4 stars, it also leads me to believe that the ratings are not real. It could not possibly be that other people who like her are listening to this and not considering suicide.Don't buy it and, more importantly, don't listen to it. Ever."
5,Absolutely breath taking,WOW! This CD is so powerful that I cried the first time I listened to it.My favourite songs are by far Hello God and Raven Dove.This woman has a voice like an angel.Her voice can soar above any other singer you can name in the world.I can't even express in words how beautiful her voice is.I LOVE DOLLY
5,Transcendant,"""Halos and Horns"" continues the acclaimed artistic resurgence of Dolly Parton. Without question, this album ranks with her finest work from any decade in her long career. I would disagree that her songwriting took a dive in the 80s, as has been written -- it was the production that may have been too slick, but the songs were mostly terrific. Still, here, as on the past 2 albums, the whole package is inspired. Her songwriting is as sharp and observant as ever; her singing achingly beautiful and soulful, like the sound of the mountains; and the musicians just perfect. While the whole album is tremendous, her reworking of ""Stairway to Heaven"" -- a song I would never have cared if I ever heard again -- is jaw-droppingly beautiful and an instant classic. It leaves the listener high, and a believer in something truly divine. How else to explain the great Dolly Parton?"
2,I was SOOOOO disappointed,I'm a huge fan of Dolly's and absolutely loved both the Grass is Blue and Little Sparrow CD's. I looked forward to listening to this newest offering with great enthusiasm and was really crushed! First of all - What happened to the band? Where is Jerry Douglas? Allison Kraus? I thought many of the songs were silly and the arrangements were sappy.Darn.
1,Quality of sound horrible,"This was not a quality sounding selection. Sounded like it was made on a 45rpm, 60 years ago. I did not keep it, I gave it away and they did not care for it either. I will not purchase another Dolly CD."
4,A Reader,"I enjoyed this slice-of-life book very much. I was a bit wary at first. Since I'm not a christian, I wasn't sure how much I would identify with what the cover implied was the main character. However, this isn't really about Phelim so much as it is about his town. It presents you with pictures of various people throughout the town and without so much poking fun at them, lets you laugh at their hang-ups and foibles like you would laugh at a much loved sister or brother."
3,It's The Season With Lucy The Bean Queen,"... and that's one of the best episodes I've seen. It's a perfect example of the classic Lucy set-up: logical beginnings, but purely illogical, crazy scheme. The DVD says they did their best to clean up this set, which was a portentous sign. The 'I Love Lucy' and 'Here's Lucy' sets are much better viewing quality. It makes me wonder if it is the company issuing these or if they truly were unable to clean them up? Even 'Green Acres', which was made the same time, is immaculate quality. Still, you gotta get 'em when you can find 'em. And, while the plot themes are repetitive and you wish Gale Gordon would tone it down even SOMETIMES (I think Lucy saw him as a quasi-father figure and never gave him hard direction), there are lots of laughs to be had. Thanks for the laughter, Lucy. :-)"
4,GREAT scent!,AppleCinnamon is the only Glade Plug In scent that I like. (The others are far too sicky sweet for me.) I wish to find them much cheaper so it wouldn't cost so much to use. Good product for doggie smell on rainy days. Joyous/East Tennessee Smoky Mtns
5,"Not one of Melissa's best albums, but well worth the money!","While I am still anxious to hear how the Japanese record companies would handle Melissa's first two albums, HOME TO MYSELF and BRIGHT EYES, I am nevertheless very pleased with the job they've done on this reissue of SINGIN'. The artwork and sound quality are superb.This leaves only three stand-out albums from Melissa's Bell/Arista catalog that have not seen the light of CD day (the two I mentioned above and HELP IS ON THE WAY), so my fingers are crossed. Actually, so are my eyes, toes, and legs! :-) (I'm not counting her EMERGENCY album from the 80's, which I would love to have on CD because I'm a completist, but I would rather have her 70's albums on CD first.)"
2,Flogging a dead horse,"M.C. Beaton's series featuring constable Hamish Macbeth used to be a charming cozy, set in Scotish Highlands. It was light and funny with simplistic murders. Far away from serious read, but oodles of fun. Well, that's over and done with. Ms. Beaton churns at least three books a year in as many series, and it's time for a break. It is all so repetative with the same cliches, same tired routines, and just no fun anymore. Thrill is gone baby for good..."
5,studies of a female nude,awesome book! great quality pictures. nice and big for the coffee table. wonderful black and white from cover to cover.
2,Star Office,"The good: Runs on Windows, Linux, and Solaris; handles most basic office-suite tasks, such as word processing; uses XML file formats that reduce file size and let you share documents across OSs; license lets you install suite on up to five machines. You don't need to activate itThe bad: lacks collaboration features; offers no database, dedicated Web page maker, PIM, or e-mail app.Microsoft Office is expensive. But you get what you pay for."
5,Stories and spices and lustiness,"This was a truly marvelous book. I'm not sure what Kirkus Reviews was thinking. The comparisons to Tom Robbins were accurate, but Tom Robbins comes off as cynical and jaded where Nightingale is truly a man in love with everything: words, stories, food, spirits, nature, lovemaking, and love itself. This book is, in a word, delicious. I urge anyone who likes to be rolled up in a blanket of sensations to read this. I will be reading it aloud in bed for many years."
5,A must have,I put these on my '05 Searay 220 SD and am very impressed with the result. Very little bowrise during holeshots and these greatly reduced the tendency of the boat to porpoise in a chop. I really dindn't notice a gain in top speed but okay with that because that a pretty useless thing to do anyway.
2,Not sure if i like my performance,I put these on 18' Parker Center console. No doubt my hole shot improved. I'm having problems with the lean created by passengers and other boat wakes. They do not adjust well port to starboard. Matter of fact they're terrible at it. When you get caught up in a larger boats wake it becomes down right hairy.
3,Nice hardware but crappy software,"The unit itself is fairly nice but the battery door on mine failed to latch completely and as a result it woobles when set on its end. The display is very low quality for its price. Difficult to read at night with battery backlighting on. The chief complaint is the mapping software. How about an hour to transfer 19M over a serial cable (assuming your computer even has one!). Then there is the mapping software itself. Shouldn't that be the heart and soul of this device? I have had numerous problems finding locations with the Mapsource software. Talk about frustrating. The maps are incomplete (for San Antonio at least) and sometimes they will give directions that are impossible to follow. I guess thats why there is a legal disclaimer every time you turn it on. Overall, a very disappointing device. Look for mine on Ebay!"
5,Great gadget!,"I just got this the other day and have been using it non-stop. It's far better than the built-in nav system my old car had (an Audi), since the included CD covers the entire USA. Also, it is so nice to be able to use the unit in different cars (including rentals!). A bit slow to upload maps to the unit using the pathetic serial connection, but I am told that they are introducing a USB version sometime in the future."
3,So disappointing!,"The story of Zorro is timeless, but this edition did it absolutely no favors! It is full of typos (virtually one per page)and in one case, there is a repeat of nearly an entire page! I had hoped for something much better."
5,SIMPLY GREAT,"Lucero has a simply beautiful voice. She's great, special with mariachi band. For all Lucero's fans this album has to be in your collection.Sanja, from Slovenia /Europe/"
4,The Trouble with Tuck Review,"This is an inspiring story of a little girl and her dog, who triumphs against all odds. Helen adorded Tuck from the moment she saw him. Being her best friend, Tuck waited daily for Helen to come home and play. Twice, Tuck saved her life. Now it was Helen's turn to care for Tuck. He was losing his sight and Helen was determined that blindness would not end his life.This story is great and can be enjoyed by all ages and all people exspecially pet lovers."
1,Unbelievably poor service.,"I ordered the long bed version of this jointer in Jan. After 2 delays already, Amazon is now quoting a June delivery. Jet says these items are available and have never been on backorder. Amazon says they can't get them, no other explanation. Amazon, you have lost a few customers on this one."
3,Great Jointer (Out of the Box),"I use mine almost every day on heart pine. You can tell the machine is obviously made tough, just by looking at it. Ran smoothly and did a great job. However, I wore my blades out and had to replace them. Still did a great job but now it vibrated, so I bought good Amana blades for the next replacement. Still it vibrated. I am not sure, but I have a hunch that the Jet people spin-balanced the drum AFTER the blades were clamped in the head, so now when you replace the blades it will always be out of balance no matter how good your replacement blades are.What do I have to do to get this thing running smoothly again, remove the drum and get it rebalanced ?"
5,Sturdy Reinforced Tab Manila Folders Made in the USA,"These manila folders are 1/3 cut meaning that there are three different tabs in the box of 100 (while this doesn't come out evenly, I have yet to discover the odd folder). The tabs are reinforced and the folders are made of quality stock. The folders will do a fine job in any office and at home too."
5,let papa sleep,This is the book I remember most from my childhood my sister read it to me probably on a daily basis and I remember it fondly. I've read it to my daughter and now she reads it to me. What a great book.
2,be careful,You have to be very careful with these bits. When they break through to the other side of the material being drilled they will screw themselves right down to the chuck and if your hand is near any part of the piece being drilled you can get your fingers smashed. I thought this was a quirk in my first set but when many of them broke I bought a second set. Same problem. They screw themselves right through the material being drilled instantly without completing the hole. They are very difficult to hold back and prevent this from happening.
4,Sometimes they drill too fast !,"These bits are great, but watch it, sometimes they'll drill farther than you need because they are sharp."
5,Purchased as a gift,I bought this for my son for his birthday and he was excited. Had it mailed direct so I never saw it but the outcome was great.
1,It's junk,"I do not recommend this machine.It is not sturdy. After using it several times, it broke and I can no longer use it.You cannot make more than a couple servings at a time; the dough begins to clog up the workings of the machine and it ceases to turn. You have to clean it all off before making more. Cleaning it is not that easy, a lot of parts get a lot of dough on them and you have to dig it out of the nooks and crannies unless you don't mind waiting for your dishwasher to run or for it to dry out so that you can more easily just brush it out.It makes a horrible loud squealing noise. The manufacturer actually acknowledges that it makes this noise and says that there is nothing wrong when it makes that noise. I disagree, it's a horrible noise and I think it's just another indication that this is not a slick machine.I'm buying a hand-cranked one to replace this one."
5,"Excellent, exactly what I was looking for",Gives a nice touch to my still life photos. Works well with my Canon i9900. 16 17 18 19 20
1,discontinued and no notice!,I waited and waited for an order from JD foods to come for a Xmas gift. Even received a notice that the order was placed and correct...only to find out through my OWN efforts that the product was discontinued. Bad communication. Will not make that mistake again!
1,Crooks,They sent the item to the wrong address and had no regard for my loss. The total loss was only $10.00 and that is how petty they were. They lost a first time customer over $10.00 and an old VHS from the 1980's.
5,A step back in time,"Well-written scientific description of air quality problems. Written back in the 1960's, it is fascinating to read from our present perspective on this timely subject."
1,I finally can review the item...,"I finally got the saw. It was pretty easy to set up. I have made a set of shelves with decorative ends. It went smoothly. I would agree with one of the other reviewers, buy new blades. The initial blade went pretty quick using maple for the shelves. I would rate four stars for the saw. No other major complaints.I ordered this item on Sept 26, 2006. The item alledgedly was to ship within ""one or two"" business days. I have only experienced delays from Amazon. I wonder if this was discontinued and now Amazon will just cancel the order. With the number of similarly priced items purchased over the past three or four years (not including items purchased by my wife), you would think that Amazon would ""belly up to the bar"" and make good instead of just cancelling the item."
5,Bandsaw,"Arrived in a very timely manner. This item exceeded all expectations from Amazon. Quick, free shipping and easy set up. Got the riser block at the same time to make it a one time set up. Whatever was written before as negatives on these two items seem to have been resolved. I had absolutely no problems setting it up alone. The pulley system was already aligned from the factory. More than enough electrical cord to install the riser block without incident.Be sure to order the proper blades you may need from Highland Hardware if you are into resawing or need a spare blade. I am very pleased and have recommended this item(s) to friends."
4,Overall good book,"Its a good story but I was confused by something. The author says she was also abused at a younger age than she was in this story; however, there are times in this story where she mentions something about how this had never happened to her before and that this guy stole her innocence. So it made me wonder about the previous time. Overall, a good book to read to help someone build the courage to say something. Nice to know i wasnt alone in this kind of situation."
4,"Almost As Good As Zebop, Marathon, Shango and Freedom!!!","If you want real Santana, check out the following CDs. There are remastered imports at the end of the listings for many of these top rated CDs. Inner Secrets, Shango, Marathon, Zebop, Freedom, Beyond Appearances, Spirits Dancing In The Flesh, Blues for Salvador, Milagro, etc. The latter Santana releases are just as good as the early gems. Santana has grown by leaps and bounds since the Black Magic Woman days. I encourage you to get a remastered (import) copy of this. Amazon just listed all of the remasters for these, but they are listed at the end... The early CDs to get are as follows: Santana 3 (remastered), Caravanserai, Amigos, Oneness (Silver Dream, Golden Reality) and the live 2 CD masterpiece Moonflower."
2,If you don't have a computer...,"Plenty of letters, plenty of numbers, ok that's what it is for and it gets the job done... This book is useful if you don't have a computer and a printer but..."
4,Honeywell heater,"I recently purchased this heater at a yard sale for $10. It seems to work fine (I have 5 other similar heaters. I got this for 2 reasons 1)Our central forced air furnace makes a little too much noise 2)I have repaired forced air furnaces before...I would rather use it is a backup. Just a note..I am an electrician, and all electric heaters are 100% efficient by nature. I believe natural gas is around 90% now. Electricity is cheap where I live(The cheapest in the world) and natural gas is unavailable, so this was a natural choice."
3,Gets warm but not if you are over 15 inches away,"I bought this at Walmart when an ice storm hit. We plugged this into our emergency generator and this ""Large room"" heater is not a ""Large room"" heater. Our living room is rather large and the temperature in the room has risen above a very cold 50 to about 64 since we have had this running... for NINE hours. nine hours to raise the temp 14 degrees in the room. I will give this a try in the master bedroom tonight where we have moved our pre-teens in with us until we get full power restored. May be it will warm up the bedroom. My only real issue is that this is marketed as a ""Large room"" heater and it just isn't. Medium - maybe.. small.. sure. Wally world had this for $65 and it was the last one. All the other heaters left over were marketed as small or medium room - so you can see why I am irritated that this didn't perform as expected."
1,Beware of return/repair policy,"Note that I don't actually own this heater. I owned the Honeywell Whole Room heater. It worked reasonably well for a whole season, then it failed. That, in and of itself, would not be big issue. Every space heater I have owned has failed before warranty (3 of them). However, Kaz, Inc's (owner of the Honeywell brand of heaters) return policy is ridiculous. You have to pay to return it and pay a ""processing fee"". I'm guessing this thing is heavy.I recommend staying away from anything by Kaz. That includes Honeywell, Vicks, Braun, Enviracaire, and SoftHeat. Their customer service is lacking that important ""service"" component.I can recommend Vornado heaters. They failed too, but they fix things for free, paying for shipping, and are nice about it."
2,Loved it but now scared of it! PLEASE READ ME,"We bought this for our newborn baby's room and used it 3.5 years. At first it seemed to do the out of control skyrocket temp thing but then we figured out its quirk. Turn it on, let it sit 5 or so min then set the temp to where you want it and it will keep the temp for long periods of time meaning months if your power doesn't go out. Setting the temp right away when you turn it on does not keep the temp, you have to wait to set it. After 3.5 years we noticed small amounts of oil leaking, thank goodness we have it on a bathroom floor now as it would have ruined carpet in our child's room. more and more oil has been coming out so I decided to google reviews on it and I immediately unplugged after reading reviews. the home we lived in when we had it in our child's room did not have wired smoke detectors so I am very thankful we did not have problems with it sooner."
1,save your money and don't buy this heater,This heater only lasted three months and then the electronics malfunctioned in a subtle manner as in you can program itbut if you walk away for a few minutes it just turns off.These heaters are filled with oil so disposing of them is a pain. I'm currently trying to identify the oil I drained from this heater.Please note this heater was replaced with an equivalent delonghi which has been working great for years.
1,Thermostat does not work,"We lower our thermostats to 58F at night in the winter. I bought this to heat the room where my 1.5 year old grandchild sleeps.I tested it for about 3 days in my office. The heater made the room about 5-10F warmer than the thermostat indicated. I thought I could solve that by setting the thermostat lower than I wanted.The first night I used it with our grandchild, I set it to 65F. Sometime in the early morning, we heard our grandchild crying. I went into the room and it was 95F. The thermostat for the heater was still reading somewhere around 65F.To make matters worse, the packaging said that if there were any problems, the heater should be returned to Katz, not even to Honeywell and not the place of purchase. So I was expected to disassemble it, repackage it and ship it???I have lost all respect for Honeywell."
5,Son's favorite,This happens to be my son's favorite flavor jar. I always have it on hand for him. I often mix it with rice or he'll want more than 1 jar!
3,I did not like the hands being double dummy,"I thought it was decent, 3 1/2 stars. I did not like the way the hands were presented and the card play described. Other recent nooks have done a better job. Maybe this was a good bio for its time, but more recent books, such as Hammans ""At the Table"" or Sabine Aukens book ""I Love this Game"" were better.I also liked Zia book ""Bridge My Way"" a lot more.Overall the book is ok, but its not great, its not a 5 star book."
3,What Happened?,"I am a long-time Linda Lael Miller fan. Absolutely loved the Corbin series and have re-read these books numerous times.I could glimpse some of the magic in this book but there was something missing. You didn't really connect with the characters as you didn't get a real good insight into their emotions or inner thoughts. It was hard to empathize with the main characters because you didn't get a full picture of what experiences shaped them like in Ms. Miller's other books. For example, in ""Banner O'Brien"" Banner was divorced and struggled to become a doctor and Adam Corbin was the eldest brother, driven doctor hiding a secret from his family. Overall, disappointed that the book never fully evolved for me."
4,Boleros!!!!,"I must say that this is one of my favorite latin albums.The only problem that i found with it and perhaps the reason for not giving it a 5 star rating is that i find the voice a little off. I'm not sure if it's because the singer on the album is trying to hit some weird notes. All i know is that at times to my ears it sounds like it's a little off.Otherwise, this is a great latin record worth checking out. The highlight is her rendition of the song nostalgia. It's very moving."
4,"Great tips for the beginner, great reference","Starting as a complete Linux novice, I've used this version of the book and CD to:- Run Knoppix/Linux as a standalone Operating System- Connect to the internet w/o a hard-drive installed OS- Create a dual boot windows/Linux-Debian machine- Update Debian hard drive using apt-get tool- Rescue/clone multiple windows hard drives using 'dd'- Recover crashed windows NTFS drives using 'dd_rescue' and 'dd_rhelp'- Clone Linux (knoppmyth) hard drives using 'dd'The book does not tell you much about Linux file systems and how to move files, copy files, extract/create TAR files etc. Recommend Debian Linux Bible to get oriented with Linux commands from the terminal/console."
5,Great Fun,"I bought this as my first lathe in 20 years. I never really got going before and was a little concerned. What a joy to use, no vibration, easy accessories and just plain fun. In addition to my wood shop I also have a metal shop and use those lathes quite a bit. No other piece of gear I have bought in the last 10 years has been this easy to set up and fun to be creative with. I went out to the woods and gathered some burls from dead fallen trees. This lathe handled those hard difficult pieces with no problem. I would definitely agree with one of the other reviewers that you want to work with sharp tools (this is of course true with all wood working tools. I highly recommend this lathe to anyone wanting to try out turning."
5,me and my sister's dream,"Jo-Ann Mapson has really touched me with her new book, Bad Girl Creek. I used to love Hank & Chloe the best of her books, but this new one's even better! My sister and I have often joked that we'd like to end up living someplace like this, with lots of cats and flowers growing in pots and no men around to bug us...unless they are like the UPS driver in this book! I like how she plays the women against each other and explores friendship. Somebody said this was book one in a trilogy? Oh, I hope that's true! Would love to see what happens with Phoebe, and Nance and Rotten Rick--sexy character even if he is a scoundrel."
3,Not what I expected...,"I was really excited to start Bad Girl Creek. However, I was rather disappointed. I picked it up, based on the excellent reviews and for a book group. However, I just could not get into the book.While I enjoyed the premise of the story, and thought it was clever, I did not enjoy Mapson's writing style. I felt the characters were unrealistic and contrived. I found myself forcing myself to continue reading where normally, I can't stop. I was unable to feel the story, and therefore had a very difficult time continuing the reading.I was disappointed, however, I still gave it three stars because I thought it was clever, albeit somewhat poorly executed."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,"Lucrecia has it all, the sound, the feeling, the look..In this album she sings boleros with minimal back up (percussion, guitar) and in the style of ""filin"" (feeling)for a most intimate effect. The selections range from the common, as in ""Contigo aprendi"" to more obscure fare, including a Bola de Nieve composition. Her voice is passion, rythm and smoke, rum and tobacco. All in all an incredible album, if kind of a sad, melancholy one, but what a talent!!! one negative: they added applause at the beginning of each song, seeking an intimate club-like setting, but it comes across as annoying."
4,Real Nikon lens shade,"This shade fits my 18-105 Nikkor lens perfectly. It can go on forwards and backwards and there are no artifacts to be seen at any range. Do not buy the less expensive ""universal"" hoods for your lens."
4,Nothing short of receiving grace,"There are a few tracks on this CD I remembered singing (in choir). The up-beat foot stomping, hand clapping tunes: ""I'M SAVED"" (my favorite); ""SOMEHOW I MADE IT;"" ""READY WHEN JESUS COMES;"" ""WE GIVE YOU PRAISE"" (slow pace but sweet); ""WHAT SHALL I DO?""; ""SONG OF PRAISES"" (slow pace but sweet); ""GOD LEADS HIS CHILDREN"" and ""GOD IS TAKING US AWAY"".In overall, this is a very good CD. The analog to digital transition was smooth. No hissing on the CD."
4,Pretty Good,"all-star baseball 2000 is pretty good- there is a few problems with it though. it will get boring after awhile and it is way too expensive. it is also kind of dissapointing when you beat the game- it takes forever to beat all the individaul baseball games and then the end thing is really boring and stupid. it is also too easy to hit a home run. other than that, it will keep you hooked and is pretty fun."
2,Don't let HSS or its coating to fool you,"I bought a 1/4"" size bit from Amazon. Amazon handled shipment very smoothly, but the bit itself is a big disappointment. The bit is not sharp and does not cut cleanly. I think Amazon should carry better products. It is sold by Amazon, I was expecting high quality stuff."
1,it didnt work for me,I was diagnosed with a skin infection and was told to use this greasy stuff....it didnt work.I found a folk remedy online that did work for skin infections.
4,Christian symbolism in a nut shell,"If you wants to understand the symbolism of the christian myth and don't want to spend hours reading in depth, this is your book It answers the question, what is the point of Christ's message from Jungs perspective, writings and indepth study. Dr. Edinger has many other books that go much deeper if your curiosity is tweaked. If anyone understood the complex implications and meaning of the ""archetype"" as Jung used it, it would be Dr. Edinger He tries to reach a audience with varying degrees of exposure to Jungian ideas. He should be applauded for that effort. I realize he doesn't need me to champion his work.. But I will anyway. In the Swedish review previous to mine Dr. Edinger is accused of perhaps being a ""lazy dog"". Well, perhaps the writer should read Dr. Edinger's writing that speaks to the reality of projection in the psyche. I am a christian and I loved the book."
1,so easy to break,"i bought this cart right before i moved into a new apartment, so i thought i could use it for moving furniture by myself. at the first time i used it, i just felt the plate is too low, so if you put things on it, it's really difficult to pull up and roll the cart. also the extended handle is too short, so if you are tall, you will feel the pain i got when roll the cart. well... i still can live with that. but once i bought something from ikea and used it to ship to new apartment, the cart broke its right wheel when moved from side-walk to the road. i promise the weight i put on the cart is not over 150 pounds, but it's so easy to break. with the broken wheel, there is no way to fix it so it's totally unusable after one week i bought this cart."
1,It is BARGAIN PRICE for a reason,"Shallow photographic wanking without flavor or soul. I think that a good test for any celebrity photography, is to put forward the question - ""would the image work if the subject were not famous'. Hmm.So take the test with this book, and perhaps any of Mark Seligers drivel , with this new hypothesis. If the image is visually interesting, despite the fact that the subject is famous, then drinks all round. If, however, the image looks more like a polished stock portrait image, then.....you know who I'm talking about Parry, you thoughtless bounder."
1,extremely disappointing,"When I recieved the wand and began using it, I would have given it 5 stars. Unlike many I've seen, this wand has a flood setting in addition to other spray patterns which works well for my extremely thirsty potted water-plants. After a month or two, the trigger became increasingly difficult to depress, ultimately not working at all. I can't imagine what I could have done to the thing to cause it to cease working since it just sat on the back deck with the plants. Poor craftsmanship? Don't buy one."
1,The Worst Movie....Ever,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. ""Boring"" is an understatment. Do not watch this movie. Do yourself a favor, and save your money."
2,Dated and Boring,"Sorry to say, This Broadway Theatre DVD was awful and the only scene that was fine was the two gays doing, ""Let Me Entertain You.""Definitely dated and suffered through it.......NOT worth buying."
3,Not subtle,"I was hoping for a more subtle fragrance - yes, I know, you shouldn't buy aftershave online if you don't know the product already. The stuff works well on the skin, and may also act as a mosquito repellant - just kidding. I won't be buying any more. You'll like it if you like a ""typical"" men's fragrance and like it strong."
1,Poorly translated average book,"This Book could be good but due to the very poor translation, it does not deserve to be recommended. This is really a mess since I read the book twice and did not understand anything. Unless this book is properly re-translated in good english spend your money elsewhere. Shame on the translator and also applies to that person who gave this book 5 Stars.!"
4,Does what you expect,"I was expecting a film about a Battle, somewhere on the west coast, and I got exactly that, no complaints."
2,Battle Lousiana,This movie is very hokey and should be retitled Battle Louisiana. If you know LA the first thing you notice that it isn't in LA. Went downhill from there. Otherwise it's better than than the remake of War of the Worlds...but not much.
4,Worth buying this movie,"Battle Los Angeles is worth the money, I saw it in theatre and then bought the dvd. This is a pretty good sci-fi movie with good special effects and good actors, the aliens aren't anything new but the story moves and I wasn't disappointed. If you like sci-fi Battle Los Angeles and Skyline are well worth the money.P.S. THE MARINES GET HIT HARD BUT KICK BUTT AND NEVER BACK DOWN IN THIS MOVIE, ""Retreat, HELL!!!!!"
2,director likes to shake the camera,i couldn't watch this movie because i was getting motion sickness 1/5th of the way into the movie at the movie theater. waste of 10 dollars. don't watch this if you are like me. movie directors these days....
5,Nice!!!,"I thought this was a pretty good movie. It progressed very quickly, not a lot of building the plot nonsense. Once the action starts it keeps going pretty much through the end of the movie."
2,mediocre,CGI movies are fun to watch but the story line sucks. There are so many characters in Battle L.A it is hard to follow who is who. And what's with saying Staff Sgt every 5 seconds?
2,Battle:Los Angeles,This movie let me down.It seemed to drag on forever.Boring and I didn't care if any of the characters lived or died.They could have showed the aliens more than they did.A better alien movie would be skyline.It actually had some characters that you cared about and they showed the aliens alot more and it definitly was more entertaing.
1,Fast Forward,"This film needs serious editing, 80% of the content is unwatchable, just plain stupid script, you can watch this in 15 minutes by fast forwarding the boring dialoques."
4,Great CGI and Battle Scenes,"First of all, this is not an Original Movie like the name of the production company ""Original Films"" would lead you to believe. The plot is the same as we have seen, Alien Invasion for our resources. In a bit of an original twist, they are after our WATER instead of oil or metals.They come in a typical manner, as meteorites and they invade large coastal towns. The US Marines are the focus of the military operation in this film as usual. By the time the World realizes they are being colonized, the only major city left to defend is LA.AWSOME CGI and AMAZING battle scenes make this film worth seeing..."
1,Dumb and Dumber,"About the stupidest movie I have ever seen. Filled with cliques, plot makes no sense, there were only a couple of good actors but only two. I don't know how many times they said, ""staff sergeant"" or ""I'm not leaving you behind"". I think it would be a determinable mind set for a twelve year old. Actually I can't figure out why aliens would invade LA in the first place."
1,"Full of subliminal messages, boring. Yawn!","This movie is not only boring to hell but packs a plethora of subliminal messages aimed at the young and dumbed down generation. I guess ""uncle"" sam aka big brother is using this movie as a front to boost army enrollment and promote fear against a possible alien encounter (be it friendly or not).If you get thrills at this type of propaganda this movie was made just for you.Just think, why so many movies lately about alien invasions (Battle LA, Skyline etc?) The government is up to something and as always we're ""entertained""."
1,boring,The 1st 5 minutes and the last 15 minutes are watchable. The rest is a bunch of uninteresting drama set behind the vague backdrop of an alien invasion.The characters are presented in a way that makes them uninteresting. we never care if any or all of them die.The dialogue is so phony and 3rd gradish that it made me want to watch a good movie about marines instead.
4,"Very Good, needed more though.","I need more info on the alien attackers, I need more more more, I guess that means a sequel? the film moved very fast, and I didn't get bored one time, Nothing like Independence Day. The acting is average from all, definitely a guy movie. Special effects are very good, but not special really. For me the Directing style is what stands out, The pace and the hectic style. very realistic in this regard. I feel as if the movie needed an extra hour. more back story, more build up to the invasion, or at least some real in depth explanation of why, who, where, they were or came from. but in the end my complaints, will probably be applauded by others for that mystery. I want answers."
2,Maybe I can help.... I'm a vet.,"Dreadful dumb movie written for 14 year old boys. Deadly dull, even as everything explodes around our heros. There are no ups and downs in this film. After the inexplicable mid-war intro to flashback beginning, and some of the most cliche ridden exposition ever, it's just a constant bang-bang-fest to the point of numbness. And then it slows down(!!!!) for some expected internal confrontation, tragic deaths of parents (the kids are alright... thank god!). Then after a rousing speech compete with serial numbers of the dead, they save the world.Ho hum..."
4,Good. Action. Aliens. Guns. Man show!,"Marines who kick arse, but don't take names (presumably because they don't speak squid alien), is what this movie is. Not the greatest or most creative plot in the world (alien invasion, how novel). The acting and action is fairly good. Action packed and filled with arse kicking. Definitely a renter!"
3,Disappointed it wasn't really science fiction,"This was basically a war movie that happened to have aliens as the enemy. And considering they were aliens with the technology to bring all those weapons across interstellar space, *extremely* far fetched notion that their weapons would be so similar to ours. If you picture the aliens as Russians or whatever, then you have a pretty standard war movie with a lot of special effects.Not nearly as much sci-fi as I would have hoped for, and way too much sentimental drama. Tons and tons of non-stop shooting action if that's what you're looking for. I guess I was hoping for something closer to War of the Worlds, and this is a world apart from that movie."
1,Terrible Movie.,The plot kinda reminds me of Independence day. Where the aliens have mothership that needs to be destroyed to disable the drones. Absolutely nonsense. Yes fastward is the way to see this movie.
1,COOL POSTER. GREAT TRAILER. AWFUL MOVIE.,Nice marketing but a truly awful film that hardly shows any alien action. Avoid this. You have been warned.
4,good action. WW2 like,What can I say. LA gets pretty much wasted. YAY!! A good action movie with heart. Makes me hopeful that we do have men in our services that rise above it all and do what must be done...
4,Solid Marine movie,"This movie is great summer popcorn. Not sure why it got the bad rap. Marines, aliens, and a pretty cool ""on the ground"" filming style. Semper Fi!"
4,The second half of the movie is EPIC,"The first half of the movie is lagging and not at all intense. There were some scenes which I thought were a little too much like the staff sergeant tying the shoe lace of the kid while trying to console the kid. I get the idea behind it, but it was a little too much and unnatural, I think.The second half of the movie after the protagonist takes the charge (as staff sergeant), is on a whole different level. Its good. Inspirational speech (or I think it is just venting his feelings out), great ending to the movie are big pluses.I definitely recommend to watch this if you like action/alien/military genres. cheers."
2,Weak-sauce!,"I just watched this movie and it was only mildly entertaining. It's a very ""Hollywood"" rip off of ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""District 9"" rolled together with ""B"" actors, with a little CGI sprinkled on top.This is just another ""me too"" movie, not worth the purchase really.Synopses: Earth attacked by aliens, Underdog band of soldiers waltz in and save world, where the rest of the ""powers that be"" failed. Add some bravado at every opportunity. The end.I'm sure I've seen this premiss in several other movies, and probably better done.Spend your money on a better movie."
2,mediocre and not worth renting,"Having had an illness lately and being bed bound a bit I have been in search of action movies to get my mind off my suffering. Two of the ones I saw in this vain were: The Eagle, and ""I am number four"". Neither were great, but I could get subsumed in the reality they created. Battle Los Angeles on the other hand was super cliched and not very believable at any level. We are supposed to empathize with the staff sarge and his personal pain and then watch him as he performance continuous heroic acts that make his soldiers worship him. Following him everywhere he says hoorah. I love a good action war film and I'm hoping cowboys vs aliens lives up to expectations. As far as this piece of trash though, save your money."
4,Battle: Los Angeles,"Show alot of leadership, will power to live, to protect, strategy of fighting. Worth collecting and tons of action pck which start from the begining till the end"
2,Battle?,"Well, I saw a lot of Marines, but I saw very few aliens. I saw a lot of running by the Marines. I wonder if they had a small budget. Anyway, this is one of those movies where all the best parts of the movie are in the trailer. Save your money and your time."
4,"Old School War Movie, with Aliens","Battle: L.A. is a simple old school John Wayne style war movie. Heaping scorn on this solid, action packed film is like complaining Glee isn't like Phantom of the Opera. This is Saturday afternoon popcorn entertainment:decent acting, good special effects, linear plot, happy ending. A ""Good Guys versus Bad Guys"" story, the tough, patriotic Marines square off against invading aliens who are bulk goons fit only to catch a righteous bullet after menacing the innocent civilians. What's the problem?I'll be adding this to my DVD collection."
4,Good flick,This is a great movie. I did notice pauses while it loaded but it was a good picture and quality
1,Terrible,"I am so glad I didn't pay to watch this movie. Not only are the characters generic and boring, the dialogue is painful, and the story so uninteresting. The only way I got through it was to listen for cliche military movie phrases like ""this is not a drill"", ""I didn't sign up for this!"" ""We've got company!"" etc. Please do not waste your time or money on this piece of theatrical crap."
1,Nice special effects. Stupid plot.,"I'll admit the special effects were good but the plot was just stupid. Aliens from another planet FLY to Earth and the military doesn't think they have air support?! Sorry, I couldn't get past that! Just dumb!"
2,If your attacked on the street...,"By a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu guy, then this is a great book to have. But since 99% of the time the attacker a. does not know martial arts, b. has a weapon of some sort, and c. cannot grapple at all, this book is not the most useful in my posession. I can see the pros and cons, but this book was made more for the ring, I would say, then the street. it is, however, very well written and and photos are clear, so it isn't a bad quality book, butI don't see it as useful on the street. If you want to add some kind of grappling to your JKD, I would check out any of Larry Hartsell's books or Ron Balicki's book is very good and has some useful grappling inside. Just my opinion."
2,booo@!,This game makes me tired. Isn't very updated. can't even profrom a submission move and the royal rumble is hard. championship mode is to long. give it a D-. the weapons match was good.
4,Snazy...BUT where are the special moves?,"YES,WWF WAR ZONE is the ''BOMB'' but what happened to treditional special moves like the 3:16,sweeet chin music or the sharp shooter .The game was terifik until there seemed to be no special moves or sign of blood.My 3 rating isn't bad but that came from the the creat player analog.Cheers wwf but smarten up."
2,Not loving it,"The case doesn't close when I put all of the chips inside it. I was also pissed off that the plastic packaging that contained the chips were broken when I received this set. This is the second set of chips I own, and I like my first set better; I just don't remember the brand and price of the first one to really help with a comparison. This is not a bad buy for 80$..."
2,If I hadn't seen 'Live In Concert' with Erick Johnson...,"This performance has Vai and Satch burning up like we all know they do. Mr. Malmstien can wail all over the fretboard like a mad man but it would be nice if he would actually compose some music. Arpegios and blazing neck length scales are impressive but tiresome after all of 2 minutes. The ""Live in Concert"" DVD (filmed in Mineapolis) with Erik Johnson is WAYYYYYY better in every way. Vai, Satch and Johnson have a chemestry that just works. The songs played by Satch and Vai are better on the Johnson concert and they are each in absolute top form in every set. The last set with all 3 maistros is blues/rock oriented and is so well done! I was absolutely amazed how well Satch and Vai incorporated thier unique playing to more traditional blues/rock covers. Malmstein is an ego-maniac who was an uncomfortable ingredient in an other wise fairly good mix. Smashing his guitar to pieces might have entertained us when we were all teenagers... not today."
3,Diverse talents,"Satch's stuff was solid blues-based,true rock-n-roll. Soulful and melodic at times. Vai's stuff was innovative and creative (his first piece on a triple-neck was the highlight of the show for me) and Malmsteen's flawless fretwork was awe-inspiring. That said, I found myself digging the group jam more than Satch and Yngwie's solo stuff. The three stars are for Vai's brilliant set and the jam. The downside of this DVD are the bare-bones extras, Malmsteen's tinny tone and a lack of dynamics across the board. What I mean is, too many of the tunes are too frantic, especially Yngwie, who I can only take in small doses. It's a pity, because if you ever heard his song ""Crying"", you know that his incomparable technique can be mesmerizing when he chooses to play with some feeling. If you can pick this DVD up for less than ten bucks, do so."
3,Not bad,"This DVD should have had the full set'sof Satriani,Vai and Malmsteen.I don't know why they only have5 song's for Satriani,3 for Vai and5 for Malmsteen.Overall,watching these guitar playersjam together is amazing.This is a must own for every fan onlyIf you wanna see a 2 hour dvd."
3,Cannot hear Yngwie during jam session,"This DVD is a big disappointment since you cannot hear Yngwie during the jam session. The solo sets were all great but you buy this for the jam session. When Satriani mixed this he took Yngwie out of the mix during the jam session. Although there are parts where Yngwie deserved to be taken out of the mix during the jam session (e.g. Satriani and Vai have something great going and Yngwie plays garbage all over it), Yngwie did not deserve to be taken out of the entire mix. If you are primarily an Yngwie fan and are buying this for the jam session, don't bother."
5,Great quality,"My daughter really appreciated this gift, the quaility is excellent, really nice , that's it, just nice, worth the cost"
4,Afghanistan Junkie,"I am interested in everything Afghanistan. Although I have read many books about Afghanistan, I was looking for something to help me visualize the country and its people. Claude Baechtold groups pictures by themes and reveals the richness of the country from tiny villages to the middle of Kabul. This book is good for people who know something about the country and can appreciate the diversity of its people."
1,Is their a rating with no stars??,"I've been searching for good movies in the Blu Ray format, but the pickings have been mighty slim. Too many of movies are high in computerized mayhem, comic book characters and extra-human gymnastics and watery thin in plot, while the others are shallow, crude, unfunny and just plain dumb ""romantic comedies-???) like this one.None of the delightful romantic tension between D B Sweeney and Moira Kelly in ""The Cutting Edge"" or the more mature interaction between Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in ""Somethings Got to Give"" ever develops in this one.Don't waste your money.I wish the disc producers were quicker in transferring more of the old classics to the new format which is really incredible and worth the money, instead of putting out inane drivel like this."
3,Buyer's beware (No Spanish -Latin- audio),"First of all:Very funny movie, we really enjoy this movie with my wife and daughter.The bad news for latin people:The audio track listed as Spanish is in fact a Castillian track, the accent is from Spain. We had to listen in English with Spanish Subtitles.Bad for Sony."
3,"Check out ""A Good Year"" instead","This movie had some of the right elements of a classic, but went wrong in too many ways. If you're going to spend time and good money on a beautifully done romantic comedy, take a look at Ridley Scott's ""A Good Year"".The highlights of ""Made of Honor"" are Patrick Dempsey and Sydney Pollack. I don't understand why the female love interest has ""mom hair"" and the ending was terribly disappointing."
4,National Champion Kansas Jayhawks Shirt,"It's a nice shirt, exactly what I wanted. The shirt has vibrant colors & lets everyone know your alma mater or your favorite team. I would highly recommend this shirt."
5,Great Christmas Movie!,I bought this DVD solely because of Michael Shanks playing a lead...but even without him in it I would have loved this movie.
3,Great for connecting the dots...,"This book is a staple for anyone looking to connect the dots between tangible shareholder value and intangible assets. In our work at ThinkShed we often see companies struggling to make the connection between culture (as a metaphor and measure of their operating model) and the direct impact it can have on shareholder value.We work with companies to help them align their culture(s) to their stated strategy or two help them effectively merge cultures and we will often refer skeptical executives to this book. They read it and they get it! (We then help move them from ""getting it"" to ""getting it done"")This book is a breath of fresh air in a sector that could well do with less rhetoric and more practical steps!"
3,"Great performance, poor recording","This Broadway rendition of Pirates made in Central Park (80's) is probably the best performance I've seen with this cast. I was hoping to find the movie with the same cast (Angela Landsbury is in the movie as the maid), but this copy will have to do until it is out on DVD. The quality is poor in places, but the music, singing, and acting is the best ever! It's worth the purchase! Kevin Klein IS the pirate king! No one has done it better."
1,Quality is Dreadful,The picture and sound quality on this DVD is dreadful! It's a great disappointment.
5,WONDERFUL,"I read the mixed reviews that had been posted, but purchased this dvd despite doubts.I am thrilled that I took a chance. Yes, the picture and sound are not the same as a movie on a dvd, but this is a theatrical production, people.It was like having great seats to the show, but no one with a big hat in front of me. The performances were lively and fun and I found myself cheering and laughing along with the audience, which imho, added to the enjoyment.The cast was tremendous and perfect in their roles. Kevin Kline, George Rose and Tony Azito were the comic relief in this comedy.I recommend this production without hesitation."
1,"Excellent play, terrible recording","I wish I would have read through the reviews BEFORE I bought this. When I was young, my family had a movie version of this with the same actors, so when I saw ""The Priates of Penzance"" with Keven Kline, Linda Ronstadt and Rex Smith, I thought ""great"" and just bought it. WRONG! It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so obvious that it came from an analog source. Have you ever watched a video tape so many times that it jumps and hiccups and the picture gets all fuzzy and the sound gets all muffled? Well, they didn't even TRY to remaster it - they just copied it to disc. If you're going to buy this version, GET VHS - save yourself the couple of extra dollars - it's not worth it.PS the version that I had as a kid had Angela Lansbury, this one does not."
2,NOT the Movie,"This is a pretty fun version of Pirates, but be forwarned, this is not the movie version. This is a tapped live stage performance. Consequently, the audio and video quality is pretty low. Which, frankly, sort of eliminates the purpose of this show."
4,ANNOINTED,I have been a fan of Yolanda Adams for years but she is at her peak on this album. The collaborations with noted gospel and r&b producers were a good idea. She is annointed and blessed and I can feel the Holy Spirit when she sings. Thank God for such talent!
4,A Bit of Hip Hop,Yolanda adds a bit of hip-hop to her style without loosing her sincerity and gospel flavor. Excellent to have in your collection for the Mary Mary and Kirk Franklin fans!
5,Truly a blessing...,Kudos for home town girl Yolanda. I think back to the years when Yolanda was at Forester Elem teaching. She was a great educator in the class room and she is a wonderful gospel singer today.Yolanda is a beautiful woman of God. You can feel the Holy Spirit through her songs. I feel so enriched after listening to her music. This is a CD that shouldn't be missed. Keep the faith Yolanda and know that you are loved. Be Blessed!
2,Too much technique,"I wanted to like this book and I probably would have liked it more if it had been about 1/3 as long. The technique weighs down the images and I could only take small doses. Not that it's a bad technique, it's just too redundant for my taste when presented in this quantity."
2,An okay book with disappointing ending,"For the most part, the story line of the book carries the reader along. There are parts when the fishing gets really exciting. However, I hate it when authors talk about boredom. When they write that their character is bored, I get bored reading it, and that's not fun. I thought the display of Mikey's trust and love towards his step father was touching, but I guess I felt betrayed at how the ending played out. I know that it's impossible to ask for perfect hero action out of Bill, and that's fine that he wasn't a hero, but the scene where Mikey confronts Bill is so unbelievable, it makes the entire book seem unbelievable. I put it down thinking I had wasted my time on a story that was pulling the wool over my eyes, and that doesn't make me feel good about myself. Rather disappointing."
5,Yoga Experts Were Right - This Is Excellent,"The paper I read (Argus Leader) ran an article where they had fitness experts review DVDs in various categories and whether they were ""Worth The Workout"". This DVD was highly rated across all categories-There a good workout for all parts of the body- it was not boring,- a beginner could ""absolutely"" do it, and an expert practitioner would also not get bored due to the levels and variety-the instructor was professional (they noted that J.J. Gormley often writes helpful articles in the Yoga Journal)-the experts would ""absolutely"" use the DVD again.Anyway I picked up all four DVDs (there were recommendations in the general category of Cardio, Toning, Pilates and Yoga) and so far am extremely happy with all of the titles they recommended. (In fact I have some of the titles that they stated were very poor titles, and they were right there also.)So if you are looking for an excellent Yoga DVD, look no further, the experts were right on the money in their review."
1,BORING/POOR EDITING,"The voice over and sound quality is TERRIBLE! . On top of it, this is hard to follow for the fact that it is distracting due to the sound quality and is a total snooze."
2,"I don't like giving negative reviews, but","I am an experienced yoga and exercise DVD person, and enjoy a range of hatha yoga, including slow and precise styles as this one is, but. I really don't like this video and can't see it's value relative to most other yoga DVDs I've tried. Not sure if others will find use, but I think it's confusing, not well produced and there's way too much space between segments. I say check out some other options."
3,Good for poses but not flow,"As many who've given 3 stars and below have noted, this DVD focuses more on poses rather than flow. Even the segments entitled flow don't flow well, and there are moments when the instructor's moves and verbal instructions are out of step for splits seconds.My main complaint is that given the modular format of this DVD, it would have been good to get a list of the sequence of poses/flows. There is a lot of redundancy, and I don't want to discover over the course of 48 workouts exactly what each exercise offers. I usually have a specific goal I want to achieve, and unfortunately I've no idea which exercise to use to meet my objectives."
3,meh,"Maybe I am missing something, I don't know. I bought this based on the amazing reviews, but I have yet to experience what everyone is talking about. Perhaps it is because I am used to more of a flow style of yoga, this video is more 'downward facing dog' then you hold it for a few breaths and then 'seated twist' comes on and you do that for a few breaths. There are a lot of different options of routines but none of them flow. The ab routine is just a lot of twists and I have yet to feel challanged on any of the poses or workouts. I have a horrible work schedule of having to do 12 hour shifts and I am only able to work out on my days off and I want those workouts to count and I have never felt that I am getting a good workout with this dvd. The instructor does do a great job of explaining the poses and proper allignment though. I feel bad for giving it such a poor review as everyone else loves this dvd so much, but I have not been able to get in to this at all."
1,A Waste of Time,There is no flow to the routines. One minute she's lying down and the next second she's standing. A very pooor editing job. There's alot better stuff out there that works you thru an entire routine from start to finish.
5,Great for At Home,"This yoga series is a good supplement for those either learning yoga from a yoga studio and instructor and those looking to explore yoga further.So much offerings, its hard to begin where, but start where you feel the most comfortable and what you want to do. The workout time variations are great if you short on time or just want an express workout to wake you up or relax you before bedtime."
2,"too slow, a bit borig","I recommend it to the more elderly population, or if you want to meditate more than exercise...For me it is too slow and make me want to fall a sleep."
3,too advanced for me?,"I found it hard to follow and maybe too difficult, in even the easier practices. Maybe I'm just rusty but that's my take."
5,Great video for all levels!,"I think very highly of this DVD and pop it in frequently for a guided home practice. There are many different practices to choose from, separated by level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and time (under 40 minutes or over 40 minutes). Each practice is titled after the goal or effect it is likened to which makes it easier to choose the practice you want to do that day. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a wide variety of practices and learning in one package. :)"
4,Great Yoga Routines!,"I am an advanced beginner when it comes to Yoga, and this DVD has everything I need. I've tried many of the beginner's routines, and especially love the Yoga for the Spine 50 minute routine because I've got chronic lower back pain. The flow routine and general routines are also very good. J.J. gives great instructions for how to enter each pose and get the most out of the stretch. The one negative is that there are times when she doesn't hold each pose long enough!The DVD is a great financial alternative to paying for all those yoga classes. And, as I learn more about yoga, I can use her instruction to create my own routines (holding the poses as long as I want!)."
3,Really Bad Cueing,"I really like Gormley as an instructor. But I have difficulty when I try the routines on the mat. Instructors have different methods and approaches, and I like the fact that she advises to give 50% effort. I also like the matrixing idea. But this DVD is badly edited and the cueing is terrible. Gormley's instruction doesn't synch up with the flow. It's very difficult to get on the same page with her. It makes the experience frustrating. I've been doing yoga for many years. I can't imagine this being easy or pleasant for a beginner. The only way I can keep up is to look at the TV all the time, and that isn't easy when you're doing yoga. It's a shame too. This could have been steak tartare, but it turned out to be chopped liver."
5,Life Changing,"This book has been so very helpful in figuring out both my past and present relationship with my mother. In addition, it has helped in dealing with her and other mothers in my life. It also helps me to be the best mother I can be to my young children. It is a must read for anyone that struggles with the ""mothers"" in their life."
3,FYI,"I would check out what the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had to report before you purchase the book. I am making no claims on the effectiveness of the system, but it appears the CFTC states some of the advertised claims are inaccurate. If you search for Curtis Aronld on the web, you should run across the document that I did on the CFTC's web site."
2,Kindle version full of errors,"I was impressed with Lauck's book ""Blackbird"" because of the well-written story, but even more by the perfect editing. I seldom read a book any more that is not filled with errors. I read this book, which continues her story, expecting the same perfection. I was shocked to find the book full of errors that should have been edited out. I hope the errors will be corrected and the Kindle version re-published with corrections. When that happens, I will re-read the book and will enjoy it far more than during my first reading. I also read the third book, and there were very few errors, making it a good read."
4,Still Waters,"This book picked up where Blackbird left off and continued with Jennifer and her brother Bryan's story. There were many sad moments as expected, but she triumphed against all odds in the end. I can't imagine going through what she did and still becoming a happy, healthy person. I especially recommend it to the readers of Blackbird."
5,Go Jennifer!!,"I am indebted to Jennifer for what she has shared in Blackbird and Still Water.In Blackbird, Jennifer's description of moving her princess bedroom furniture from the commune to the last house with Deb blew my mind. The vision of a ten year old girl pulling dressers, mattresses, a bed, etc. across an intersection by herself, was unreal. I feel like I internalized this experience and can only imagine how it resides with Jennifer, the person who lived it. Her strength is profound and will for normalcy truly unshakable. Boy... she showed them!I am so glad her life turned out okay. I hope to read more later in life. You go Jennifer!!"
1,HSM3,I ordered the 3 disc of High School Musical. When it came it was the wrong item. It was just the blu-ray disc.
3,HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3 SENIOR YEAR,I am very glad to have purchased this dvd from Amazon.com I saved a couple of bucks on it and that's always good for me. I am pleased with my chose I was completing the movie series. I would recommend anyone to buy movies from Amazon I have purchased others and will do so again. My only problem was with the movie it self it could have been done better. I will always thinck the best one was the first one.
1,Who Farted?,"'Cuz this movie reeks!! Anyone with half a brain can see that Disney has shamefully resurrected the clichéd teenage musical films of the 70's that make real people sick to their stomaches. At nearly two hours this vomit-inducing garabage heap will only appeal to nave, preppy tweens with nothing better to do than sponge off their parents money or gullable soccer moms, who instead of sitting around with their Hannah Montana clones all day, should be looking for a job.With the innovating title ""High School Musical"" we follow the same politically correct ensamble of so-called actors from the first two installments into their senior year of high school. This cast of perfect little dittoheads then sing and dance their way through all the lame problems of their senior year and graduate.Are you sure somebody didn't fart? 'Cuz this reeks BAD!"
1,Complete and utter rubbish...,"I read this book in order to give Mr. Denning another try (I had to see if I was wrong about how he has no grasp of the Forgotten Realms)...Disappointed again. Let somebody else do FR novels instead of him, please? And for those of you howling about how it's 'official', I beg to differ. The book was written from that sluggard Malik's perspective. It's complete allegory and hearsay, therefore it doesn't seem to be something that WotC will build upon. At least they better not...So, rejoice. Look to the Prince of Lies as the last 'offical' word on the goings-on of the FR gods (or to the trilogy of FR gods-related books such as Faiths & Avatars, Powers & Pantheons, and Demihuman Deities--at least James Lowder and Eric Boyd know the Realms well enough, both in novel and game terms!)."
5,The 5 star review probably said it best.,"This film is artsy and well acted. However I think it's incorrectly marketed as a horror movie. I read that a lot of people are confused about ""the horror element"" and who's who and which is what. The point of the story is that the horror element is meant to be a metaphor.Usually a metaphor isn't meant to categorize a film, which is why I think this was incorrectly marketed as a horror movie. Juno temple is typical juno, cute and naive which plays very well from the Riley's role as the hard nosed street wise skate punk. This is at heart a true love story. Great cinematography and by no means is a porno. I would put this up there with the notebook as far as content. I'm sure there was more than a handful of people wanting some girl on girl action, if so this film is a let down. As a good drama it's right up there in my book."
4,The Black Madonna,"Little Italy, on the crossroads of Spring and Thompson Street, are the whole world for Louisa Ermelino's characters in THE BLACK MADONNA. Focusing on the power and control that Teresa, Magdalena, and Antoinette wield in the ghetto, we watch their sons and catch a glimpse of their interwoven, sometimes heartrending, sometimes-comical lives as they live in the tenement. The mother's lives center around protecting their sons at all costs, and often these methods can be rather unusual.Although the author developed the characters well, I felt that the plot was terribly weak. The story didn't seem to go anywhere and fell flat. It was, however, an interesting peek into the seemingly simple but truly complex lives of those who lived in the ghettos from the 1940's through 1950's."
1,"Effort not worth the end result! Process doesnt match what the directions, short lasting taste","My kid LOVES bubble gum and cooking.I thought this would be a fun combination. The directions state to use a disposable microwave proof container to melt gum base for 10-20 seconds. It actually took about 3 minutes to melt gum base!The disposable microwave containers I used (Gladware mini bowls) melted under that length of time on microwave high level.I ended up using my own microwaveable soup bowl....it took much effort to get the gum residue off the bowl.It was EXTREMELY difficult for young hands to stir the melted gum base with corn syrup....I had to take over. The kneading of the product was easy for my kid to do. They thought it was cool to chew their home-made gum!However, though the initial flavor was good, the flavor lasted a mere 20 seconds, and then it became tasteless hard rubber in your mouth. The effort put forth was not worth the end result! I am tired of of gimmicky TOY FAILURES!!!!!!!!!!"
1,ergo pruner size small,"I returned these pruners because they were not very sharp. The seller was very nice and accomodating. However,the second pair was not any better.These pruners seem chintzy and I do not recommend them."
5,High quality,"Same as previously sold at Lowes. Now rebranded under Coleman Cable. Excellent quality, orange indicator lights (constant). Jacket material and plug construction / connections is outstanding. This is the real deal.Purchase again? I have 3"
5,best audio biography,I think it was pretty good for people such as them. I think about them diffrently about their characteristics the way they had taken it. They weren't as bad has I had thought after I heard it.
5,Lohfink for non-seminary,"I am reading this book after reading ""Jesus and Community"", also by Lohfink. I am an older student and fairly well educated (B.S., B.A.). I found the books somewhat slow going but packed full of insightful and thought provoking information. Although Lohfink's background is very different from mine, his use of scripture made it possible to stay on track with his points. I have had hours and hours of discussion and comtemplation from this study. I am in the process of redefining my concept of ""church"" in response to some of these ideas. I would recommend this to any lay person for serious study (if you aren't scared to pull out your dictionary and don't get alarmed if someone references ideas or texts that you don't necessarily agree with)."
3,ambition,"The white album (minus Goodnight) is well played, but ultimately has mostly rarity value. Who would prefer it over the original?On the other hand, ambition has got to be admired; they pull it of nicely, with some ferocious solos thrown in from Trey.However, Reba, Golgi, Divided sky and Sleeping monkey work very well for me..."
1,too cheap,"the pans were not as described, instead extremely thin and cheap .they were much too thin.these pans are not for a long time use"

3,Lyrics,"Wow! ""What it Feels Like to be a Girl"" - the lyrics hit the nail on the head! I'm glad to see someone is publicly expressing it."
2,Not so great mixes and a lousy Spanish-language version,"I think that earlier Madonna single remixes have been so much better. Both Beautiful Stranger and American Pie are two examples. Here, on this single, the remixes aren't ""signature"" sounding. I think all of these remixers have pulled all the tricks out of their bags. Will someone new step up to the plate?I probably would have given this single 3 stars, if it weren't for the AWFUL Spanish version of WIFLFAG. The translation is weak and contrived, and Madonna's delivery is so laboured and grating to the ear. Is this the same woman that gave us the awesome ""Veras (You'll See)""? Although Veras wasn't flawless, it sounded so much better translated into Spanish than this dreck."
5,Inspiring.,"So far this is the best maxi single released from her 2000 Music album. What It Feels Like For A Girl is the strongest track on that album, and this single has some excellent remixes. The best one being the Above and Beyond remix which is featured in the controversial video. What It Feels Like For A Girl is a song unlike any I've heard. I have never heard such a song where these sentiments and fears and so clearly expressed with enough emotion, without overtaking the simplistic nature of the message of the song. The maxi features 9 remixes, including the Spanish verison of the song. Kudos to Madonna for this single, and making this song that many women and girls will remember and listen to for inspiration."
2,Eh....coleman equipment just isn't what it used to be...,"I ordered two of these flashlights for camping...they were both cracked when they arrived on my doorstep..in their ""made in china"" box....returned them...received two more....same condition...would not recommend...plastic is very thin it seems...china's finest."
5,Everyone should own it,"This is really a helpful book. So much more useful than those ""doctor"" books. Clearly, these nurses know more about basic care than most physicians -- that's what makes this book so useful and valuable. I think every household should own a copy."
1,Item still not received,Please note we have still not received this item [USB 2.0 Hotsync Data and Charge Cable fits Sansa e280 8Gb / e270 6Gb / e260 4Gb / e250 2Gb / e260R Rhapsody / e280R Rhapsody MP3 Player].It has been over a month since we have placed this order.
3,Heirs book 1,"This book is not listed as a Christian novel but it should be. Although the story is written in an interesting way, the story should be called Dianna lives in Jobs reality. There is so much death and shattered dreams it was hard to slog along and read to the open ended first book. It is too preachy for a general story and although I figure that message of faith and salvation is what the Author wanted to drive home, a heads up in this review section would have been appropriate."
3,Poor writing,"The story was very good, but the writing was very poor. she used words that would never have been used during that period."
3,"Overall ok, but hard to get into","This being my first book by Tracie Peterson, I have to say that I liked the book overall, however it was extremely difficult to get into. I liked the strong characters, however so much tragedy was hard to get through. I only truly LOVED the book in the last 1/3 of the book (some 270 pages into the book).My recommendation.....give it a try!!"
5,Had to read again!,"Several years ago when this series came out I read the whole series, or should I say that I hungrily devoured every word of the books. This first book, ""Land Of My Heart"", will just get your taste buds to salivating. Montana is presented in all its beauty, wagon trails and all their adventure and danger are vividly presented, hardship, romance, and a spirit of determination, and much more fill this book. You will race to your computer to order the rest of the series after having read this book by Tracie Peterson. I am blessed to have a Kindle which provides me the capability of reading in very large print, thus I can enjoy this series again. YIPPEE!"
4,Very well written and a fun read,I enjoyed this book. It is a genre that I just love to read about. The author did a great job bringing each character to life. Take some time and read it for yourself. You will enjoy it as well.
4,Good read,Good to read a book with Christian values. Plus I like books that reflect the past and what people endured.
3,Waiting for the second book!,I enjoyed this book. I liked the main character quite a bit. I was kind of hoping she would run off with the Native American man but oh well... leaving too many ends untied in the end is going to make me look for the follow up to this story!
2,HORSE & WAGON TRAVEL TO NEW LAND,NOTHING NEW. SEEMS TO BE ANOTHER OLD WEST STORY. SAME OLD THING. CAN'T RECOMMEND IT. SOME PEOPLE MAY LIKE IT.
3,WHOLESOME,Nice WHOLESOME book sprinkled with the hardships and trials of early settlement of Montana and the west.Enjoyed reading very much.
1,Rating of Everything We Had by Al Santoli,"We are very disappointed with your service! I purchased the book shown because my husband is the Marine on the cover of the book and I wanted to give it as a Christmas present to a relative. You sent me the book with a different (unoriginal) cover. I do not consider the book with a group of soldiers in the jungle an original and is not what I ordered! As for the Everything We Had, it was a NY Times best seller in 1981, many love it!"
1,Not worth the money,The quality of this product was low; cheesy materials that were not nearly as nice as they looked online.
1,Not for beginners,"One of the worst introductory books I've seen. There are many unrelated windows/OOP topics in the first week. When teaching you the programming, I found the difficulty level is poorly handled. In the first day of real programming, you are taught threads! For a beginner, you have to learn many of the common components by yourself, the book doesn't help you much. The authors claimed to be VB programmers too. They should have read 'Teach yourself VB 5 in 21 days' and 'Teach yourself C++ in 21 days' before starting to write."
2,"Poorly written, bad grammer and vague examples.","I found so many grammatical errors while reading that bring you up short with a ""What?"" and make you reread the sentence trying to make some sense of it that it really made the book tough to read. I found some example source useful but too much was focused on CRT apps and not enough on using Delphi in a Windows environment. The fundamentals of the language were not focused on strongly enough and the author's attempts at humor were more distracting from the topic than funny. I'm glad this book came free with my copy of Delphi Desktop because I wouldn't buy it over something like Marco Cantu's Mastering Delphi or Peter Norton's Guide to Delphi if I was shopping now. Borland should stick to including their own tutorials and manuals instead of bundling books like this. It makes them look shoddy"
1,Does not fit,I have the same problem as the other reviewer. This starter did not fit my 2002 Porsche 911 3.6L.
3,Typical Miller,The camera work is fabulous as usual. I found the downhill ski dummies very funny. The only thing I didn't like was the music soundtrack. It was actually annoying. But the price was well worth it.
5,Finally love for gays too,"Stephen McCauleys book ""True Enough"" is a wonderful book where love, and all the probelms and challenges with it, is the main theme. It is written in a non-sentimental way and combined with humour and excellent observations of human behavoiur. What adds to its value is that this book is one of the relatively few gay novels where one get the feeling that there may be such things as long-term gay relationships - a long waited message in a fast sex centered culture, which for decades has been emotionally depraved but nevertheless is still very dominant. Gay or not, the persons in the book are also faced with the difficulties of preseving the affection and respect for their partners, however, the description of their struggles and how they handle and mishandle their love life is both inspiring and entertaining."
5,McCauley in great form,"The thing I like best about Stephen McCauley's work is that the characters all have their frailties, but somehow they also all have their lovable characteristics as well. And, as usual, the main character, through whose eyes much of the story is reflected, has initimable sarcastic wit. The supply of wisecracks, always suitable to the occasion, seems bottomless. This one would make a very interesting flick..."
1,"Oh, Stephen .....","Reading this book was like chewing on a tough piece of meat - you keep chewing and chewing and there's absolutely no flavor and you never get anywhere. All you're left with is a soggy mess.Don't get me wrong - I loved McCauley's previous novels, went to book signings in the Castro, met the dude (what a cutie) and chatted with him awhile. But that was a few years back. This one tends to make me believe that he must be going through a mid-life crisis to have written this colorless, odorless waste of time. It reads like one of Jane's fabricated program ideas, and perhaps that's what it is - the joke's on us, McCauley just wanted to see if we would read and `say' we enjoyed this just because it has his name on it."
1,Reminds me of that hippi guy on That 70's Show...Man,"This music is slow, on one song ""Sweet Leaf"" which sounds like what they were on when they made this music, begins with a cough! What the hell did I waste my money on? This music is so slow and dragging that it put me to sleep the first time I listened to it. This music reminds me of that hippi guy on That 70's Show when he keeps saying ""yeah that's cool man"" because he lost all of his brain cells smoking mariquana. That's just what this music sounds like, spaced out hippies playing music while being stoned ABOUT being stoned. These guys suck really bad. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE, AND WHERE ARE ALL THESE RAVE REVIEWS COMING FROM? MUST BE MORE HIPPIES SMOKING DOPE. WEIRD."
4,A great DVD,This DVD was really good! The only extras were the image gallery (only feathering sailorvenus) and DVD credits. The episodes were good and the price for 7 episodes and the Japanese/English dialog was great. The subtitles were a little bit hard to read in some places (if they were green it probably would have been easier to read) It was a great DVD!
4,Always good.,I love the Indigo Girls and they don't disappoint. Perhaps not quite as good as some of their other stuff but they've already set the bar pretty high.
5,More from Rosamund Pilcher aka Jane Fraser,"Can you believe Rosamund Pilcher (The Shell Seekers) wrote about 10 romance novels under a pen name for Harlequin and a British romance publisher before she became famous? I've read (and reread) all her novels under the name Pilcher but then discovered her other ones written earlier. They're a bit hard to find and sometimes expensive, but worth it."
1,not a good choice,"This product did not work at all for me. I tried to plant peas and beans with it. The seed kept sticking in the wheel and when it did come out, would come out sporadically and sometimes two at a time. I tried the various wheels to see if one would work better than the other, but had the same result. I was really looking forward to the work this little gadget would save, but it just caused frustration. I would not recommend this for anyone!"
5,The best version of Blue Moon ever!!!,"Wow this cd is HER best(all her cd's are her best), Wesla sounds so inspired here by Mike Grinsell's loose and jazzy arrangemets, here she's backed just by bass and piano, what a cool concept, it brings out the chancetaker in Wesla, she sounds more like a jazz singer here than on any other cd. The reason this is Wesla's ""best"" is fer her version of ""Blue Moon"" which I swear on my great, great, great Grandmother's grave is the best version EVER!!! May I be sruck by lightning if this isn't the greatest version of Blue Moon! Wesla sings Blue moon as a duet with the bass player and no other instrument, IT'S AWESOME(eat yo heart out Sheila Jordan). WOW this is crazy, wild, swingin, and romantic all at once. THE BEST, of the BEST, is on this DESEERT ISLAND CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT TODAY, TOMORROW & THE DAY AFTER THAT"
4,What a great gift!,"Here is a great book to commemorate the coming of the millennium...a retro view of the last 1000 years! This book is laid out in a newspaper format...very easy to read, and entertaining. It is a great coffee table book for the person who has everything, or for someone who enjoys looking back to times gone by. This is not just a book you would sit down and read...digesting it in snippets is the best. That also makes it last longer!"
3,Good Basic Overview of history,"From a mainstream point of view. However it is far too Euro-centric to be considered a truly ""global"" history. This book would receive a higher rating from me if it had said it was a ""Western"" or ""European"" chronicle of history but in general it left far too much out of the non-European world. Constant attention was also focused on the ""important"" people: kings, queens, nobles and what not. I would have preferred to have seen more focus on everyday people and some small snippets on what the life of average, common people were like.All in all, a decent Euro-centric history book with nice layout, design and photos (hence the 3 stars, really 2.5 but since I cannot do that I decided to be generous) If you want a very basic look at mainstream Western history then this will do; if you are looking for something deeper or more global-oriented then you might be a bit disappointed."
5,One of the best books I have ever read on the subject,"My father's story parallels Joseph Berger's in eerie ways...they were both at the Schlactensee DP Camp and the Landsberg-Am-Lech DP camp...Berger's mother's story of her youth could be my grandmother's, from an unpleasant step-mother to the flight East to Russia. My father was born during my grandparents' refuge in the USSR, and crossed illegally with his family into Poland after the war ended. I have always been close to my grandparents, but this book brought clarity and insight into topics they don't generally discuss...the duality that immigrant survivors (the displaced persons) felt between their new lives in America and the tragedy and loss left in Europe. When I look at my grandparents' happy faces at family occasions---graduations, weddings, bar mitzvahs, birthday parties---I wonder if the events make them remember times similar back in Lithuania. Berger's story, beautifully written and researched, is a must-read."
5,You Never Get Tired of It Coke After Coke...,My family and I have been giant fans of Roy for a long time. I preordered this without knowing whats gonna be on it. I just heard that some of Roy's old Coca-cola commercials will be on here. I'm very excited!!! These commercials are very cool!!!
5,TKO Records can do no wrong,"I loved this cd when it first came out years ago and I love it now that I just bought a new copy. There are loads of good bands on here, the bodies, the truents, etc.For the price, it's very worth it as you may find a bunch of new punk bands"
2,WAY TOO SMALL - and the hood design is bad,"I was very much looking forward to this product but when I tried it on my son.. It was wayyyy too small; and my son is only 2 years old. He's a little big which is why I got this size in the first place but It was not just tight.. it was unwearable.. and for the second that i got it on him.. i raised the hood over his head.. which was also way too short in the neck. It actually put him off the whole thing because of how uncomfortable ti was and not wont let me put any other costumes on him.. our kids need GOOD experiences.. The costume is soooo cute I was disappointed to send it back. I think the only way you can wear this is order big REALLY BIG. and be prepared for the costume to look/feel too big. but i guess sometimes that can be cute on the little ones.I couldn't give this any more stars even though I wanted to.. because no matter how cute it is, the sizing is so horribly off."
2,not enough detail...,"Great exterior shots of the famous Tri-star jets.. 727, DC-10, MD-11...No interior shots..... No reviews or interviews by airline pilots or workers who flew these great jets, and no interviews of passnegers who flew in these jets..Would have been great to hear from those people to get an idea of what the experience was like to fly on these great luxury airliners which are no longer in use.... just video after video of the planes taking off and landing at various airports all over the world..Extremely repetative with no real substance....I was hoping for so much more than what was provided on this dvd..."
4,Christmas joy for you and me,"Almost 40 years after the Ventures released their classic Christmas album, they recorded this second Christmas album. On that first album, they grafted the intros of recent hit songs, like ""I Feel Fine"" and ""Wooly Bully"", onto the Christmas songs. This time around, they dispense with the intros, more or less, but several of the songs do include subtle echos of classic rock and roll songs. For example, ""Joy to the World"" is reminiscent of ""Pipeline"" and ""Feliz Navidid"" is reminiscent of ""La Bamba"". Anyway, the songs are all played in the classic Venures instrumental style, with one exception. That exception is the last song on the CD, which is not an instrumental. It is an original Christmas song written and sung by Ventures founding member Don Wilson, who turns out to have a decent singing voice. This is a very good Christmas album that upholds the standards set by their first Christmas album. And it's twice as long as that first album."
5,Beautiful Night Light,This night light is a beauty. It's now a pleasure to stumble out of bed in the middle of the night! I recommend it highly and will be getting more for gifts.
3,I feel like a Grandma...,"These come up wayyyyy past my belly button and run up like high waters... Would be more comfortable with a lower waist. Material is good though, and they resist stains that horses are prone to give you."
5,A Celtic Celebration!,"This is a truly wonderful celebration of Celtic Christmas music. From the uplifting ""The Mummer's Fig-Christmas Eve"" by The Boys Of The Lough to Natalie MacMaster's bittersweet ""Get Me Through December"" (sung by sweet-voiced country artist Alison Krauss) to the beautiful reverence of ""Don Oiche Ud I mBeithil"" by Dordan, this is a must-have for your collection. Highly recommended."
5,Fronte Del Palco (Live)--Vasco Rossi,"This album was my first introduction to Italian rock by a good friend in Italy. The entire thing is amazing, especially Vita Spericolata--that song gives me goosebumps everytime I listen to it, which is often!"
1,Years of gathering dust on my shelf...,"I bought the album after having heard ""Can't Drink"" and another, ""Martin Decker"" (not on this album), on compilations, which were both catchy and old-school style. As it turned out, ""Can't Drink"" was the only song on this album I liked at all -- in all the other tracks, the vocals sounded slightly different in a bad way (not as sharp, more unclear and out of key), and the tunes were more abrasive and repetitive than actually catchy. The Randumbs, in this album as well as on ""Things Are Tough All Over"", sound incredibly boring and give me a headache to listen to."
2,Altogether inadequte.,"I really love ironing. I have lots of 100% linen shirts half because they look so good freshly ironed. So, when my $20 Sunbeam died, I felt justified making an upgrade, and was genuinely giddy when the box arrived. I was crushed when this iron totally failed with my linen shirts. It did fine with my cottons, and even worked on clothesline-dried jeans that were all creased-up. My shirts, however, still looked like balled-up tin foil and took far longer to iron with the DeLonghi than with my old cheap one. I suspect it's because the iron unit itself has only half the wattage of my old iron. And yes, I had both the steam and the heat cranked to max. I'm sending this one back and getting another $20 iron."
2,Cheap parts and difficult to replace,"Good product overall, but the stopping gasket and the O ring (rubber part) that prevents steam from escaping are very cheaply made and broke after only 3 use. Called DeLonghi and they don't have the replacement in stock, plus it costs $3...which is a ripoff. They should have included at least several spares and carry replacements in stock - not to mention that you have to pay for shipping so it ends up being even more. Otherwise it's a good iron, but short from buying a new one, I don't know what else to do?! I guess trying to find a replacement at a hardware store (which would be easier if they at least indicated what size it is...)"
5,Awesome!,"As a former mechanical engineer I have an appreciation for well designed and well engineered products. This iron rocks!CON- It takes approx 5 minutes for the water boiler to fully come up to temp.PRO - Once warm it has a very high thermal capacitance, in other words, it never ruins out of steam. It does NOT drip, and the temperature and steam output is very consistent.I hate ironing and pawn it to my wife 95% of the time. But when the iron arrived we had an wrinkled antique table cloth and napkins that was in ""the basket"". Had been there for a month. I started the project and had so much fun that before long both kids joined in and we were arguing who got to go next. Dont get me wrongs, its not better than a night on the town, but as fun as ironing can be, this is as good as it gets.Great product..."
1,Kind of dreamy but Not as Steamy......,"I purchase this iron and it did not produce any more steam than a standard/regular iron. Not impressed with the heat of the element/iron as well, also standard/regular. I returned it after one use, why? It was not more effective than the iron it was replacing and at three times the cost, I could not justify keeping it. In my opinion some on the reviews of some product are bogus, made by persons paid to promote the product."
1,Don't buy this iron it does not work.,This iron did not work properly the first time I used it. I returned it for a refund.
1,Long on water spots!,I purchased the DeLonghi Ironing system in February of 2010. The first iron leaked water every time you pressed the steam button so I returned it to Amazon. The second iron arrived and worked well for about two months and then began to leak every now and then when I pressed the steam button.I have tried to contact the manufacturer with no success and have read the instruction manual from cover to cover but the iron still leaks. For years I had a Rowenta iron and regret deeply changing brands.I sew professionally and frequently work with delicate expensive fabrics. It is worrisome to have an iron that is completely undependable and will probably be replaced in the near future.
4,Ironing Like The Pros,"I hate ironing but this product makes it less of a chore. The best thing is that you can set the temperature of the ""iron"" that is in contact with the clothing ""independent"" of the temperature setting of the ""amount"" of steam. With a conventional iron you have to turn the temperature up on the iron to get a lot of steam. This often presents problems with a lot of the new fabrics. Plus you get copius amount of steam which is incredible. The one thing that you need to keep in mind is that it takes 5 or 10 minutes to heat up the iron (actually the steam) because of the large volume. So if you are doing a quick ironing job, you may put only a small amount of water in the chamber to do small jobs to lessen the time to get the iron ready. I rarely give reviews but I decided to so that those that are looking for a good product will know that if you get a good price on this iron 'buy it'."
1,Thought I ordered the GEL,"So when I ordered this I could have swore it was for the Gel, but apparently it wasn't and I received this instead. I hate lotion for massages, it dries up too quickly and doesn't have good glide potential! My own fault I guess, will look closer next time!!!!"
4,hand lotion,"I got this from massage therapy school at NHI with the oil.Never used this on anyone else and now Im using it for hand lotion.It grapeseed apricot and sesame.It has almost no fragrance at all.Its light,thin and I have it on my computer desk."
4,I liked it,It's a very nice book. The caracters are well developed and the story is veryentreteining.
1,Don't waste your time reading this one,"I agree with the review that said this was ""juvenile writing"". Very predictable. Too many ""proverbial sayings"" (doesn't she have anything original to say ??). First Dee Davis book I ever read, and I don't see anything that makes me want to read another one."
5,I Purchased this book before it was published.,"I suggest any person contemplating buying a Doberman should definately read this book. It is very informative and useful in understanding the Doberman Pincher. The writers have come together beautifully to give the very best feel for a extraordinary animal. They explain all concepts of owning and caring for a Doberman. Breeding and owning Dobermans themselves have made them experts in all aspects of ownership. Take special attention to chapter 8, Keeping Your Doberman Healthy as there is information there that is absolutely necessary to raise a happy healthy Doberman."
5,Good book about Doberman Pinschers,"This book covers a lot of basics and understanding behaviors of dogs. But if you are planning on getting a doberman pinscher for a pet, you might want to skip some chapters in this book. This book deals with a lot of dog showing. If you want to show your dog, get this book. Even if you don't, you still want to check this book out because it covers a lot of things from training to history."
4,Works well.,This seems to be a good dart board. Had little problem of it getting stuck at first but it was an easy fix. It has never gotten stuck again. I think it a good dart board so I bought one for my other house.
1,Product is defective on/off switch does not work. Does not make any sounds,Product came defective. The on/off switch does not work and Does not make any sounds when you hit bullseye. Could not return as I installed/ientified the problem after 30 days. Beware of this product. I would not recomend this to my friends.
2,Not Even On El Cinco De Mayo,"I must admit I was not blown away by this show. I watched about the first 3-4 episodes when they first aired, and pretty much thought this show was awful. To me the characters talked in nothing but cliches, and awful ""tough guy talk."" Here are some examples of what I remember (some quotes might not be exact):""I won't listen to you and neither will my men. Not today. Not ever. Not even on El Cinco De Mayo.""""I'm not the good cop, and I'm not the bad cop. I'm a different kind of cop.""Granted both of those lines came from the same character in the same episode, but that is all I remember. If it wasn't for Clark Johnson's brilliant direction of the first episode, I would not have bothered watching any of the other episodes. For my money I'll stick with reruns of Homicide on CourtTV."
5,"This is the best show on TV, ever, period.","I hadn't seen any of Season 1 before on the recommendation of someone at work, I started watching The Shield in the middle of Season 2. Oh, am I glad she made me watch this, as it's unlikely I would have found it, mired as it is on FX. Other reviewers here have mentioned that this is a great cop show. It is. But it's more than that. It is one of the very few shows where you can feel your guts twisted in ethical knots when you see the dilemmas faced by the Strike Team. Makes you wonder, ""what would I do in that situation."" Also makes you wonder ""how can they make this show any better?"" Bet they will, somehow... Can't wait for March '04 for the new season."
5,Vey realistic and well done,"This is a series like real life. It brought The Wire to my mind. Before you finish first season, you'll be wishing the second in hand."
2,dull and unhelpful,"this was a textbook used in one of my graduate school classes, and even reading it was a chore. There was virtually no ""applied"" information - nothing about how to actually do career counseling with a live human being. I would not recommend this book for anyone who is seeking usable information on career counseling, especially if counseling clients are adults."
3,Rough Diamond - 1977 release on Island records.,Rough Diamond - 1977 release on Island records.This was David Byron's first album after leaving Uriah Heep. Features Clem Clempson of Humble Pie on guitar.Tracks are:Side A:1. Rock N' Roll2. Lookin' For You3. Lock & Key4. SeasongSide B:1. By The Horn2. Scared3. Hobo4. The Link5. End Of The Line
2,"Incomplete, poor attempt","This little book is geared for small children, but parents and teachers who really want to teach their children the Italian influences on the world will find many other books to be a better resource and educaitonal tool about Italian heritage."
3,Back Flash Back,"Too bad North America does not get to listen and buy the real Flamenco players of Spain. Oscar is a very talented musician and picks his songs carefully, but to say that he's one of the greatest hes not. Tomatito, Niño Josele, Paco de Lucía, Camarón de la Isla, Enrique Morente, Manolo Sanlúcar, Pepe Habichulela, Serranito, Juan Manuel Cañizares, El Viejín, Vicente Amigo, Gerardo Nuñez, Sabicas, Ramón Montoya, Paco Cepero, The Carmona Brothers of Ketama fame, etc, etc... are the real deal. Check ( es flemenco com ) for some insight... Now, long live Oscar López, a Chilean Canadian with a Gypsy spirit..."
5,helicoil saved my lower unit,installed helicoils on my boat motor's lower unit as i broke all 5 stainless steel mounting bolts and had to drill the bolts out of the unit. installed the helicoils and everything worked out fine. amazon had a good price and the free shipping was a plus. love using amazon when i get the chance.
2,perhaps the worst Buffy episode,"This episode of Buffy is perhaps the worst. Seasons usually start off pretty rocky, but this episode is just plain annoying! Almost all of the characters are ironically out of character, and Buffy's mother Joyce tops it off with playing the queen of all ignorant and whiny mothers."
5,The Best of Buffy,"Season 3 is perhaps my favorite of all the seasons. It is gut wrenching, funny, and pure ""Buffy"". The DVDs are getting better with each release. I wish they had an interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar and the entire cast..maybe on the very last DVD they will. Here's something for you Buffy fans to look for in case you haven't already. Season 7 is dealing with the ""First Evil"" and even refers to some events that took place in season 3. If you watch Season 3 closely, you will see references made to the First in that season.For those you collecting ""Buffy"" on DVD, Season 3 is a MUST!"
5,Buffy's Best!,"I loved Buffy ever since Season 1. I love this DVD! You can watch each episode over and over again. One episode which really stands out is ""Amends"" in which Angel is tormented by The First Evil by reminders of what he had done as Angelus and even contemplates suicide. Of course nothing beats the two-part season finale ""Graduation Day."" Also, you can really get a feel for the new characters, especially Faith, the Rogue Slayer. You can understand how she is feeling and basically love her and hate her at the same time. I would rate this with more stars if it was possible. This is a MUST for any Buffy fan or anyone with good taste in television."
1,now this is a true horror movie!,"very scary, how do people take this seriously, oh and she cannot act! and has the dumbest one liners in the world. call it what you want, add some gothic touches to it, but when you melt it down into what it really is, all I see is a night time soap opera. The guiding light!"
1,The worst season in the Whedon history!!,"Season 3 was awful!! Not only cause I hate the relationship between Buffy & Angel, but because it was poor. There was nothing good but Spike & Faith. The entry of Angel was a disaster. Alot of stupid ""eternal thoughts"" with worse than season 2's idiotic stupid thirst for love. I mean how stupid could a show get? How stupid could a storyline get? What a poor production. I mean didn't you see that obsession Angel had over Buffy? That was really bizzarre. You really wanna sleep together, then sleep together! Don't eat our brains. I recommend season 7 or 6 for buying. And I'm warning you don't buy this season!"
5,Excellent season,"The third season is very entertaining. Good fight scenes, excellent drama and professonal young actors and actresses. If your'e a Buffy fan get this season now."
5,a great dvd set,"As an avid Buffy fan, I could not wait for the series to come out on dvd. I own all three seasons and cannot wait to purchase the rest of them. I feel that season three was one of the best seasons of the show. We see Buffy fight Faith, another slayer, graduate from high school and save the world, yet again. We also see the sad departure of Angel, who is sadly missed on the show. A great dvd set one can watch again and again."
3,Not quite what I expected....,"I ordered the slim set, and received the older wide set. I'm not too upset because the discs still worked and the delivery was pretty fast, but still, you expect to get what you ordered....."
5,She's Done It Again,"What a voice! Anne Murray is one of the few unique vocalists out there. Few people can record versions of hit songs that actually sound better than the original, but Anne can do so. Cheers to a vocalist who has respected her instrument over the years and hasn't ruined it by abusing it with drinks or smokes. So glad she is covering terrific classic material these days, songs deserving of her voice."
5,The Ultimate Relaxation Christmas Album,"The CD is what it is said to be, relaxing. My husband and I think is very good!"
3,Nice History of Jewish Cooking & Culture,"If you ever wondered why Sephardic Jews put dates in their Charoses & Askenazi Jews didn't, this book is a good place to find out.This is not a kosher cookbook although many of the recipes are kosher. The chapters are divided into countries rather than types of recipes. Then within the chapters are food divisions. I really liked finding out why recipes differed from country to country"
1,A horrible book for kids.,I am an 11 year old kid and i think this is a bad book for any kid to read.I dont even see any humor in this book at all it is sick.
3,Not as good as Celebrity Deathmatch,"Even though Eric Fogel wasn't involved in this, a lot of his animators were. It was a good movie, lots a great jokes but the plot was kind of long and slightly pointless and not enough violence and gore. It's good but wasn't great. People conpaired this to Team America which I found do be way better written. I still keep it as the Celebrity Deathmatch fan I am and do recommend it for collectors. It's just not a classic."
3,Who murdered the art of proofreading?,"I purchased a paperback edition. This problem may or may not exist in the hardcover version; but it shouldn't have gone undetected anywhere. It's significant for the plot that Marie Lightfoot realizes a character made a slip of the tongue in an earlier conversation. That would, of course, have been a fair-play clue given the reader. But when the reader looks back to check the conversation, it turns out that the character didn't make a slip of the tongue--didn't say the word in question at all!"
5,view from a silver planet,"Holden's mix is a bit more jumpy than other regular progressive mixes, tight metallic sounds bring it out of the darkness of other DJ's albums. The cd builds perfectly until track 8, then lets out a bit of a sputter for a few, then luckly picks up. Though, the lack luster of a few bad tracks doesn't take away from the utter awesome quality of this cd. Its a good listen, and puts a good trip on your mind with moody undertones and nice synth lines on some of the better progessive tracks heard in a long time. I found some of the songs were hard to find (i.e. mp3 downloading engines) and made it a good collectors item. Well done effort by Holden."
4,"Quality System, Easy install",The system is well engineered and easy to connect(and disconnect if needed). I installed the entire system in one of the storage compartments vs the crowded dash area. Good install instructions.
5,A Must Read for Every American,"I like to read the works of former POW's from a human potential point of view and also to understand the thinking of an enemy. Larry's story I read years ago when it first came out. I reread it recently to remind me how blessed we are as a nation. I highly recommend his work to all. You will find a raw, honest story filled with divine intervention and faith. The Authors wife divorced him while he was a prisoner and that is the only communication the North Vietnamese permitted to be passed through in his years in prison. He even shares some funny things about his captivity which I am sure is hard to do. The book is informative and surprisingly uplifting given the experiences he shares."
2,Bridget Jones The Edge of Reason,"The soundtrack of this movie is good, much better than the movie. This movie was a disappointment, Renee Zellwegger was overacting, the jokes were not very good. Not to my liking, although Colin Firth struggled well with the directing he got. Had he had the chance to develop his role it would have been even better.(The first Bridget Jones movie had a much better director, and that movie was wonderful)"
2,THERE NOTHING SPECIAL!,"I bought this cd based on reviews I saw on Amazon. People compared this group to Nirvana, the Foo Fighters, the Vines, Silverchair, etc... The list goes on and on. Those bands all have something special in my eyes (Silverchair once did). There is nothing special about the Exies. It's one of those CD's that you buy, listen to 5 times, and then wonder why you paid [$$] for it!Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone."
4,"I was there, man!!!!!","I only just ordered the CDs, this is more a comment on the show...This was the only Halloween show I attended, but what a GREAT venue... and can I say I'm a HUGE Velvet Underground fan!The ""filler"" disk (4th) is a sampling from the first night's show (10/30) - which was their 15 Anniversary show - completely rocked, I'll have to dig out my set list from the night to see how ""complete"" the set is... too bad it's only one CD! I'm gald they included the opening for ""Tweezer"" (which they didn't close `til the next night - to close out the show)!...then the next night was Halloween... (first 3 CDs) fo-git-aboud-it!I'll append my comments/give an update after I've listened to it a few times!"
4,Easy introduction to other great books,"My son recently wrote the following:The Time Warp Trio books contain amazing pictures by Lane Smith and humorous stories by Jon Scieszka (of The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales fame). Time Warp Trio books are entertaining and easy to read and were probably written to encourage kids who don't usually read much to read more. For example, in Summer Reading Is Killing Me, Joe, Fred, and Sam are sucked through The Book into ""storyland,"" where ""the Boss"" (a big teddy bear) is disposing of all of the protagonists (the ""heroes"") in books and making the antagonists (""bad guys"") the main characters; thus, Curious Mr. Twit, The Devil in the Willows, etc. So, just by reading this one simple book, kids who aren't as interested in reading may become more enthusiastic about even better books, like The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Hobbit, The Twits, Aesop's Fables, Dracula, Bridge to Terabithia, and Lord of the Flies, to name a few."
4,Don't read in the summer or you will die!,"This book is about three boys named Fred, Sam, and Joe. they have a book that is a wered book. It could take you to a dangerous place.The book can get you into trouble it can take you some other place. Like a place were a big chicken could try and eat you.But it is about three kids in their summer vacation and with the book they go to another place a wierd place. Fried has a hat that he show off to mush. Joe knows a little majic. But Sam is a regurler boy. Yes, I like the book it is a good book the second faverote book I read. If I could of change the book I will change nothing cause it is a good book."
5,Divine Will and the Choice of Love Peace and Forgiveness,"The deeply moving words of truth from Paramahansa Yogananda show us all how God endowed us with free will, so that we may come to learn, know, feel, practice, and act with love and peace.This little gem and treasure of a book is as great and as big as the cosmos with Divine truth, which will illuminate your mind, and speak to your soul.It teaches us to go within, and discover our own Divine God-Self within, where we CA N prevail in peace in our world, once we each choose to individually. It is then that the world will know peace collectively.HIGHLY Recommended to discover your own Divinity within.Deserves 10 Stars!Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence and Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE"
3,"It's Not Bad, It's Just Badly Drawn Boy","Is there any reason not to love this disc? Probably. One could argue that it's too disjointed, too eclectic, too experimental, too wacky. But the real reason I'm not going ape over this one is that it's just too much of the same. It does everything the Hour of Bewilderbeast did, though frankly not as well. Plus, coming so soon on the heels of the About A Boy soundtrack, it lacks a freshness and doesn't command as much awe as it could have. Still there are more ups than downs and I get a kick out of many songs, particulary Have You Fed The Fish?, I Was Wrong/You Were Right and Tickets to What You Need. Not a lot of pop artists can write a song with Jeff Buckley and Madonna in it and make it all work. Without question, Damon Gough is gifted. I just want him to put all his presents in one big special package. I have every confidence that there's a lot more creativity and great music where this came from. Looking forward to hearing it."
3,"Downgrade to you, sir","This was the 1st BDB album I bought, followed by ""The Hour of Bewilderbeast,"" and then a very rare EP ""It Came from the Ground."" After comparing HYFTF to his earlier work, I sadly have to say that BDB is steadily growing worse. Granted, where THOBB was all over the place with its arrangments, HYFTF is more focused. Unfortunatly, that just means the songs sound blander. The worst offenders are ""The Further I Slide"" and ""What is it Now?"" It's a shame to have a bunch of weak songs hold back the gems that are ""All Possibilities,"" ""I Was Wrong,"" ""You Were Right,"" and ""Bedside Story."" The sad fact is that yet another artist has decided to go mainstream, and the quality of his work suffers because of it. It makes me worry how good/bad ""One Plus is One"" will turn out to be. That album is still coming out, right?"
2,"Can sex be dull? Yes, if the actors can't act and the writer can't write","The Raspberry Reich is a mess. Written and directed by someone calling himself Bruce LaBruce, the movie is designed to be an-in-your-face send-up of Europe's revolutionary passions by the youth of the Seventies. Here the leader of an inept boy gang is a left-wing, well-built harridan named Gudrun, who shouts, rants and copulates energetically with her hetero (at the start) partner. Gudrun discovers that hetero sex is not all that revolutionary or liberating, so she insists that her gang members have sex with each other. Cue in plenty of gay sex acts.The visual look of the film is vivid and bold. The story is amateurishly written, acted and directed. The sex looks like it was fun. The movie, after the first half hour, wasn't. The ranting was loud. The sex, ultimately, seemed merely a way for the writer/director to provoke all the grannies in New Jersey."
1,If you like complete rubbish....,"If your idea of a good alternative film is one devoid of plot, good acting and any semblance of structure then you might enjoy this piece of utter rubbish. I think this is a sad homily to gay men who get excited seeing ugly German gay men with shaved pubes getting off with one another and then call it art."
1,Doesn't work with VIDEO IPOD !,do not buy if you have the video ipod... product does not work ! i found out the hard way. i was watching a movie on my ipod and thought the back up battery would help but it didn't.
3,Go for TuneJuice2,I ordered this and then realized that there is a TuneJuice 2!!! The TJ2 works off AAA batteries and works MUCH longer. It will give you a much better back up.

4,N1KLPL8...,"Mackenzie Carpenter (super-hottie Leighton Meester) is a typical teen on the verge of adulthood. She suffers from extreme boredom in her town of Blanca Carne (trans: White Meat). That is until a killer-clown named ""Horny"" starts chopping her friends and classmates into McNuggets! The vicious clown communicates w/ Mackenzie through a Ouija board, a Magic 8-Ball, and an Etch-a-Sketch, giving her vital clues as to whom his next victims will be! Can Mackenzie and her remaining friends (including Rachael Bella from The Ring) stop this bozo-berzerker, or will the bloodbath continue? DRIVE THRU is funny, gory, and even suspenseful in places.

3,does this sound like insane clown posse and twiztid,for all the juggalos and juggalettes if you listen to insane clown posse and twiztid's music this might sound fimilier. a killer clown killing people with a hatchet.
2,ehhh,"Not worth the cost or the bother and tastes very artificial (I know, I know, that's what it is), and you gotta use it all up. Better off buying something from the bakery."
5,Fun for the Whole Family,"""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" has been a favorite of mine since I was small and my sister introduced me to it. I would highly recomend this to anyone. It's clean and not scary for young children. I have always loved it! I think you will too! And...Happy Halloween!"
5,charlie brown season sets???,"I'm a Snoopy fan, but it's a shame that United Media releases only stand-alone dvd's... why, oh, why don't they releases Season Sets (with extras)?... the Transformers had them, why not Charlie Brown?"
3,Classic goes HD Finally!,"Blu Ray for Great Pumpkin has finally arrived and does not disappoint much with improved picture and remixed dts 5.1 audio. Picture is much better till end credits wall scene where lots of artifacts appear. Bonus short IT'S MAGIC, CHARLIE BROWN good additon.."
1,Not well........,"Well, actually I'm not a complaining person, just because I don't like it, but for sure I don't like either loose money, I have purchased too many things via internet, and this was my first bad experience about it, I never received this book and suppously the package was delivered...........well, I didn't. Good look to you with this purchase!!!"
4,Tasty jerky,"I have been wary of jerky products that do not contain sugar or Sodium Nitrate/Nitrite because they tend to be flavorless and really tough. I have eaten other Shelton's products, so gave this a try. The jerky was quite flavorful and soft (in a pleasant way). A very good product that I highly recommend."
5,book and seller were great,I just over bought. I was convinced the coconut oil was going to give me a perfect body and health. Now I don't know what to do with all the books I bought.
4,Coconut Diet,"Found most of the info in this book helpful. I am convinced that coconut oil is very good for a healthy diet. I do better with a diet that includes a variety of good fats and whole grains, most fruit and veggies and nuts. Olive oil and coconut oil are high on my list of favorites.I also recommend the book ""The Coconut Miracle""."
2,I'm not sure it's worth the effort,"I am about 1/3 if the way through the book and find it very slow going. The tone seemed pompous in the beginning, and then became mystical. I have found a few good tips (which is why I'm still reading it) but much of what it contains so far can be found elsewhere, often more simply and vividly presented. If it gets better later on I'll update this review, but I'll probably advise skipping thi first part."
4,Smarts justifies violence?,"Kramer weaves an intricate story of social fabric and personal pain. He can 'out-nuance' the best of them. The protagonist is likable in the tragic way of Hamlet. He deserved better; here he rallies and makes it so, enjoying some honest titillation along the way. But there is no escaping the current underneath this story: things out of balance require radical action. In light of recent events, it is even more poignant. Who of us deserves to make that change happen in a violent way, even if no lives are taken? I am still wrestling with it, and that makes it good."
4,beware!,"Just want to let fans of Columbian star Shakira know that shehas nothing to do with Swede band House of Shakira. Enjoy both,but don't mistake one for the other."
1,Product did not fit,Product did not fit despite OEM claim. I recommend that you confirm parts with your dealer prior to making an online purchase.
1,The Kids in the Hall: Tour of Duty dvd -Save your money!,"Brought it for $3.99 at a Big Lots, thinking it would be funny, Since I am a fan of the show, Total Waste, Waste of time and money, Not worth the 3.99+tax. not even 99 cents. Fans of the show should stay away and watch The Show, it is much more entertaining than this."
4,Gardner rules!,"A masked woman, a third-part of a ten thousand bill, a dubious deal and a nice murder (of course!): these are the elements in yet another great case in which Perry Mason displays his astonishing abilities to unveil the truth. Alibi analysis is fundamental in this one!"
1,never again,"Shocking - what do you people do for sex?' if you are not completely satisfied with this CD, listen to it again and then realize you have wasted your money' goes the disclaimer printed on the CD. Are they being ironic, I don't think so, they know all too well what a load of crap they have turned out.I will never take note of other readers coments again. I know I was foolish; my comupter could keep enough of a connection for me to listen to any samples and as the reviews were so ecstatic I decided I couldn't go wrong. Of course I did and big time.I don't know what is remotely sexy about this CD. I've listened to more sexy Brian Eno. It's blatant, in your face, look we are really naughty boys and we make music about it. Right from the 'we revel in red light district atmoshere' cover to the pathetically jeuvenile titles this CD is peurile.Well got that out of my system, back to Kruder and Dorfmeister."
5,One of the best of its kind,"This is one of my favorite CD's. The music is fairly well described in the other reviews, so I won't add to that, but I'm surprised that 2 of the 3 previous reviews pan it. Usually even mediocre albums get nothing but rave reviews, and if there is even a little criticism it's usually s bad sign, but I have over 20 CD's of this style and to my taste only the benchmark ""K & D Sessions"" and Nightmare on Wax's ""Carboot Soul"" can compete. It's cool, relaxing, sexy music. I most frequently listen to it while stuck in rush hour traffic to keep from pulling my hair out and almost regret pulling into the driveway. I've played the CD for multiple friends and they all like it. Those who are into the style agree that it is one of the best of the genre."
3,Not Dizzy's best,"If you want to enjoy a Diz on film go right for Dizzy's Dream Band, or try to run down a great tape made of one of his Cuban tours. This one, a concert at London's Royal Festival Hall in 1989 is, well, not Dizzy at his best. Sure, some fine solos (though James Moody and Slide Hampton a bit wasted here -- just not enough of them) by several Latin American stars. But Dizzy himself seems tired and uninspired, and the orchestra never quite reaches the energy and excitement one espect's of Dizzy's ensembles. This all said, the sound quality is fine, as is the video."
1,Call me stupid for buying this book!,"I was a big Anne Heche fan, until I saw her interview on the Today show and then read this book! The book has no central story line, other than to randomly repeat her stories of abuse and horror. HELLO! If I took LSD and had a random stranger massage me for 8 hours, I might imagine my father molesting me, too! LSD = hallucinations, am I the only person to recognize this? Although she may believe the abuse actually occurred, I think her 'memory' is clearly a bi-product of the drugs. I feel sorry for her and her family, but most of all for her unborn child."
2,Call Me Crazy for Reading This Book,"Is Anne Heche crazy? It's hard to tell from this book. One thing that I can be sure of is she can not write a good autobiography. This ""book"" is full of anectdotes that, if elaborated upon, could have proven to be interesting fodder for an autobiography, but Heche glosses over every possible interesting aspect of her life. Either she doesn't remember enough of her past to provide adequate details, or she chooses not to. I'm wondering if she did not stay up the night before and write it all in time to meet a deadline. The writing is poor and scattered - it probably would not have made any less sense if she wrote it in the language that Celestia learned from God."
3,Does its Job,"Purchased this device to transfer pictures off of my DSLR to my laptop. The device works well but it is no frills, there are no lights to tell you that it is reading/writing to the card and you must be very carefull when putting in the flash card since it is not a tight fit and you can bend the pins inside. Next time I will spend a little more and get something a little nicer."
1,Disappointing Float--Don't Buy!,"I am so disappointed with this float. It simply will not remain in the sitting position. Each time you get it all set up and get on, it comes undone. Now we have resorted to using this as our dog's float. I will not buy a Coleman float again."
4,historically accurate and entertaining,"When I was young, my history-buff Mother had my siblings and I visiting every old fort she could find. I did not enjoy it. However, I found that reading Micaela Gilchrist's novel was a lot of fun and added a whole new perspective to the historic vacations of my youth. Her characters are entertaining and she shifts persectives -- from Army wife, to Army officer, to Native American -- with ease and wit. Well written, entertaining and a good journey through our past."
4,Life Al Dente,Authentic Italian American. Brought back lots of memories of my childhood growing up as an Italian American. Both funny and sad at times. A nice confortable read.
2,BOOOORRRIING,"I didn't have the highest expectations for this item, given the price, but I was still pretty disappointed. I thought the material around the bullet head was going to be a soft, gel material, but it's quite hard. Also, the whole device has a horrible chemical smell, even after washing it. Doesn't really get me in the mood..."
2,=(,"I was rather disappointed with the product. It looked a bit exciting, ergonomic shape - cool color and all, but, it is a quite a bit larger than I expected. It also has a very plasticy/rubbery smell that, after a few washings with the toy cleaser, is still offensive. The fourteen speeds are slow to fast, there's no change in rythm. I do like the shape and texture to be on the positive."
1,failed out of the box - amazon wont take return,"careful buying this the (vibration control) is very cheesy and actually ""lit"" up and melted the plastic end -- i have no way to return --I am researching a course of actions now ?I wasn't happy with how the whole control thing is put together --the ""head"" seems nice abd overall this does seem like a worthwhile concept -- they just dropped the ball BIG Time on the whole speed control ... very crappy."
4,surprisingly delightful,"I know several other reviews said Doc's Lucid Dream was a little difficult to insert, and I had the same problem. I couldn't get it in by myself at first but with a little help, it didn't seem to be a problem (could be an angle thing, I'm not sure), Once it's in, it's good to go. It's not too loud, but I'd have some sort of background noise so it's not too obvious. Other than that, great toy and am really enjoying it (not as I type though)."
2,watch out,"AWFUL smell....And it will not go away. I have washed this multiple times and just as strong as the day i pulled it out of the box. And the size does not fit me right, its rather awkward. Im going to stick with my old toy."
2,takes forever to ship,"ordered it 5 days ago and still says ""shipping soon"" so yeah I do like this product and have had it before.. altho this is my 2nd because the other one burnt out after a month or two of owning it. but it's cheap and if you don't mind replacing it after awhile I'd def recommend it."
4,Practice makes perfect,"Different than most but once you get the hang of it, AWESOME! It is not about size or power but the correct shape to reach your G-spot. I find on hands and knees worked best for us. Fun toy that husband enjoys, think of a long lasting, build to that amazing moment of a G-spot orgasim. If you want down and dirty get it over with, this is not the right toy. It probably takes a little more experience and patients but WELL worth it. The quality of a G-spot orgasim is like no other."
2,Doesn't do the trick,"This vibrator is a great length (but a bit wide on the end...), and it is very durable and water proof. Unfortunately, it has a very cold, hard feel, and does not do the trick. I prefer to use it externally for clit stimulation (it has a nice adjustable vibration). It didn't do anything for g-spot stimulation."
1,Toxic smell!,"I should have read more reviews before purchasing this. I will never make that mistake again. I have not even used this yet because the smell is toxic. It smells like the worst nail polish imaginable. I bought mine brand new for a reasonable price. I cannot believe anything could smell so toxic, what did they make this out of? I am afraid if I use it I could get cancer, it smells that toxic. Unfortunately this item has a no return policy, so that is money down the drain. It arrived on time in perfect condition, except it is a bad product. I will never buy another product of their's and I will always remember to read and consider customer reviews."
2,Not what i thought it would be,"A friend suggested this item to me...to my surprise it wasn't all of what she made it out to be! 1st off the smell is horible, it's a strong plastic smell...i used a condom on it to try to mask the smell. 2nd, it's kind of huge too. 3rd, the vibrations are not very strong and i bought brand new batteries to use with it, maybe i should have purchased industrial strength! Too bad i can not return it because i would. Overall i guess this toy is not for me!"
4,Good when used with another device,"Couldn't get off with just this device by itself. When used with Hitachi Magic wand, it helped things along though and I was able to. A decent product. I liked the fact that it was wide at the beginning and the end, but also that it was a little crooked, although not enough to hurt if you weren't ready for it."
1,"my wife hates it, works under water","she had purchase this crap couse she never expiriences toys, my opinion was she didnt need it, npow is in the closet catching dust , she says it hurts and its nothing like having intimasy which i knew but she dontb recommend this item at all"
2,HUGE!!,"Ridiculously huge & totally not as expected. Un-useable!!Doc Johnson Lucid Dream 14 Multi-Speed, Waterproof G-Spot Vibrator, Twist-bottom Control, Purple"
3,Not sure that I like it,"I've only used it 2-3 times. The material is hard and the bullet, located in the tip, isn't very strong. It's not good as a clit massager (due to the strength of the bullet) and I'm not sure I like it for my g-spot. I don't find it effective on its own, so I use it with a clit massager. I'll try it a few more times and see if I like it more, but so far I'm much happier with the Golden Triangle Flamenco 6.5"" Jelly Vibrator (Purple #4) and the Athena Mini Massager."
4,Good -- but the head is slightly uncomfortable,This is very nice- feels good. But the head is quite large-- I didn't notice the 'extreme' smell it has - like others are saying. But inserting it - can be a little hard to fit. Not too bad when first inserting it - but taking it out-- can be painful.
5,MMMM feels great..,I have never had a toy before and this one sure feels great. I will been looking for more exciting fun come my way.
2,Dead Within 2 Weeks,"Yes, the title is correct. I killed this thing within two weeks of receiving it. That's really disappointing, although not as much as it might have been if the product had been a little more satisfying to begin with. It never quite lived up to my former vibrators in intensity or how it was shaped to fit.Don't get me wrong; we had some good times - for a short time. And yes, people could make a lot of jokes about the abuse I must have put it through to kill it off so quickly, but in all seriousness, it's just not a high quality product. I will not be buying this again, and I don't recommend it."
2,Died after just a few uses,I bought this with Athena a while back and had a few ok moments but now it won't speak! Ugh!!!!
2,not to good,On the vibarator it doesn't always want to turn on. Don't know if I can send it back or not?
1,Not a good tool folks!!,"This purchase was because I already had purchased this vibrator several years before. When my old one stopped working, I replaced it immediately with another just like it! Problem is, the replacement just was not made as well as the first one. The second one stopped working almost immediately (three uses.) The replacement was a total waste. Stopped working, altogether, and I would advise you to buy a different product. THIS one just won't work, and is NOT RECOMMENDED."
4,Very Nice Product,"This is a very well built product, comfortable and pleasing. I would suggest this product to anyone looking for such a device."
5,whooooaaa!,"This was my first ""toy"" and I have to say it was well worth the money! I didn't like it at first, but as soon as I started to get the hang.. man oh man! Love, love love this!"
3,Eh...,"Not one of my favorites, but its good to have around and in the collection. I only bought it because it was really cheap."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"Do not buy this, I bought this a couple of days ago, I read some of the reviews here and I thought it was good! But it has a really strong toxic smell that can't be washed away! I don't think anyone want to put that down there!! and the texture is really hard, i personally like soft material, I am regretting it now!!"
1,Didn't Work,"Product came in the mail promptly....and does not work at all. Literally--it won't turn on. No vibrations of any speed. Of course, it's non-returnable (even if completely unused), so it was just a complete waste of money."
3,Very discreet,This isn't the best or the worst toy I've ever bought.This is discreet and an easy choice to take when you travel.After all it is water proof!
3,This worked well until my cats figured it out.,I bought this feeder because I travel a lot and have two overweight cats that overeat if they are left with a regular bowl of food. This product worked very well for the first month or so until my cats discovered that they could reach their paws inside the auger to get more food. They proceded to do this constantly until the cover broke off.I looked at the Ergo website to look into ordering a replacement auger cover and found they have products called a 'locking auger cover kit' and a 'tube style auger cover' but there is no real description and when I called Ergo's customer service number I got someone who spoke like he was at an Indian call center. Has anyone out there tried ordering these parts to solve the cat food stealing problem?
2,Numerous Errors,"I would have to disagree with the other reviews of this text. I found this book full of gramatical errors, typos, and errors in the source code. The concepts presented in the text are exelent and the authors do a fine job of presenting these ideas. It is unfortunate that the editing was not better and that some of the source code seemingly was not compiled and tested prior to being included in the book."
1,Avoid this book due to it's errors.,"As stated by many others, this book contains many errors; especially in the program code that is listed in the book.There are numerous places where function calls written in the programs given make reference to variables that don't exist and won't run without editing. There are some sections where functions are added to the program code that are not discussed nor relevant to the topic at hand as if sections were cut and pasted without checking for accuracy.The whole book is full of these types of things. So while the theory behind the logic seems to be sound, the examples and applications are so wrought full of holes that you'll probably spend more time trying to debug and decipher the code than focus on what you're trying to learn."
3,How I Love Them Let me count the ways,"No doubt about it,I love my B5 boys and was very excitedwhen I recieved my copy of the dvd in the mail. althoughI have to say that the camera footage wasnt all that great.but in all I enjoyed seeing my boys blossom from cute littleboys to sexy,fine and very handsome young men. the dvd wasfunny despite the camera action, it was worth the buy. that'sif you're truly a die hard fan. I would do any thing to supportmy babies. B5 fan for life baby! ONE"
3,A good overview of Shakespeare and leadership....,"The book was an excellent quick read. What one can derive from this comparison of leadership in Shakespeare's time and our modern corporate leadership, is that fact that back then, just as today, people face the same social ailments in the corporate setting as they did during the aristocratic rule. Shakespeare played upon these themes, which happen to be the same power struggle themes in our corporate worlds. I like the different opinions of the shared authors on the character's interpreted leadership. Very well written and in a light manner, that most managers might enjoy the read :)"
5,Awesome product,"This works, I bought the SC Johnson #14157 Off Powerpad Lamp it worked like magic. So I had to order the refills for it, here they are!! They are perfect and I will use them for years and years."
2,"A decent overview for the novice, with worthless price data","This book is a decent introduction to oriental rugs for the complete beginner. Unfortunately, its credibility is seriously undermined by its just plain silly pricing information. The book purports to reduce the value of any oriental rug to a formula, and perpetuates the myth that most oriental rugs are investments. Readers are advised to rip out the pricing appendices in the back and throw them away, and simply read the front for an overview of oriental rugs."
5,Try it -- you'll love it!,A friend made me a tape of his CD and I've been enjoying it for a couple of years. I finally just ordered the CD. The music is beautiful beyond words. Some songs are very relaxing and others are more upbeat. I play it so much and never get tired of it!
3,Alarming drug content...,"I've read 8 Elizabeth Peters books to date and this was the only one that I didn't absolutely adore. I was not prepared for the amount of drug content in it, and frankly it caught me completely off guard and made me uncomfortable. If you're looking for something light-hearted and a more fun read, stick to the Vicky Bliss books."
4,Grift Sense Delivers,"Retired detective Tony Valentine takes us behind the glitz and glitter of Nevada casinos to find the grifter who took the Acropolis blackjack tables for a bundle...Only problem is:he's been dead for years! Valentine's investigation involves the usual, and not-so- usual, suspects; crooked cops and hired killers. We meet whales and minnows, plungers and pensioners, super- stars and wannabes. Mr. Swain took me for an enjoyable ride, and then he floored it for a keep-your-eyes-on the-road-and-your-hands-on-the-wheel finish. I enjoyed this book."
5,Ocean's 11 and The Sting wrapped up together in one!!!!,"EXCELLENT BOOK! Grift Sense takes you right back to the classic Hustler/Scam artist scene. It was a very simple, yet witty read.I highly recommend it if you're looking for a FAST and ENTERTAINING book avoiding the Murder and Lawyer books that are a dime a dozen out there.I can't wait until FUNNY MONEY comes out. Keep up the good work!"
5,Grift Sense,"Grift Sense by James Swain is the most interesting and rivoting book I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I had the day off and I thought I'd read a few pages or perhaps one chapter. I was hooked from the very first page and I couldn't stop until the entire book was finished.I live in Las Vegas and I know a few things about how casinos (and cheats) operate. Mr. Swain's work was 100% right on the money. He knows what he's writing about and he obviously has inside information on the hows and whys behind various scams and cons. Mr. Swain also has a deep understanding of the psychology and the working of the gambler's (and criminal) mind. The book was suspenseful, intreaging and exciting! I can't wait for the next adverture!"
4,bright light - body color not as pictured,"THis light is fantastic - very bright. The outside body color, however, is not light blue as pictured, but a dark blue, almost black. This was disappointing because I made the purchase on both the technical and aesthetic specifications. The light blue color would have matched by bike and if I'd known it was inaccurate, I probably would have ordered another model. In the end, though disappointing, it is not worth sending it back."
3,Good DVD,I was hoping for a little more on the DVD but it's good for music videos. Of course all the videos on here can be watched online I'm sure.
2,Not worth the money,"I had read several reviews which prompted me to purchase the book. This is the first book in years that I have actually thrown away prior to finishing it.Why do you ask? The characters are not fully developed and I certainly did feel Chloe and Matthew had chemistry. Chloe was clingy and spineless.Matthew didn't seem to have any ability to focus, instead he was constantly worried about Chloe.The elderly companions were a copy of the Golden Girls.Perhaps I should make another Dee Davis selection."
5,glad i got it,"If you are new to Python, this book is worth owning--it didn't disappoint. Included a disc. Problem-free, quick learning curve."
1,Simple Thoughts From A Simple Man,"I've read this book, and I can honestly say that there is nothing surprising here. The core material for this text may have come from Reagan's own hand, but it is still nothing more than a timeworn repetition of the McCarthy-era blather his speechwriters penned for him way back in the 1950s. It's sad that Reagan could never nudge his petrified mind beyond this sort of black & white world view, and it's equally sad that he continued publicly preaching it right through the 1980s. What's even sadder, though, is the sheer number of people he deluded with this Simple Simon message.This book is a valuable historical document, and people should read it for that reason. It will leave future researchers scratching their heads in wonder at the gullibility of the American public."
2,Republican Standard Evident Here,"I enjoy books like these, they're authentic and relatively honest. That said, a President should not be praised merely for their sense of awareness. Shouldn't that be a minimum requirement of any president or human being? Look at President Bush, hmmm...maybe not.Reagan was a warm person who knew how to make Americans feel good about themselves, which came in handy during those great international relations (America is better than you!) he was known for. He was an actor playing the president, nothing more. To think that he is being deified is ridiculous. Say what you will about Clinton, he was far more competent as a world leader. He spoke the truth, not just what the public wanted to hear, and he was not afraid to confront his opposition without a script."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I purchased my unit at wal-mart. In nine days the power cord broke. Customer service told me to pound sand. It's an ""accessory"". After 5 months the unit died and I sent it back. A new one in the box arrived in about two weeks. This unit makes the first unit better by comparison. I have had this unit for two weeks and it often does not work. I drive an hour to work and it does nothing but display the sirius logo. I leave the unit on all day and nothing happens but last night on my way home it was working. I will be shipping it back soon. Good customer service would make up for a lousy product but that's not available at XACT."
4,love carried me home,Love Carried Me home by: Joy Miller was a good book to read if you want to learn about the Holocaust. The stories of sixteen women that survived the concentration camp Aschuwitz. This book described the stories of the women in women to show people how their lives and other people's lives were during the Holocaust. All of the stories in to book are explained very well and I think it was a good idea to write a book about the women in the Holocaust because not many books tell about women's lives. The lives of the women in this book are sad but also happy because of them surviving. I liked this book and I am glad I chose to read it.
5,Fun gift,I gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She wanted a real frog to dissect but was happy with this close 2nd. I think this is even better because she can go back yo it again and again
2,Pretty but not practical,"Well..I read the previous reviews and thought the mixer couldn't be all that bad. I paid attention to those who had bought the ""plastic"" mixers and how they weren't stable so I bought the die cast metal. The price was right,it had all the features and size bowl I wanted, and it looks so nice so i thought I'd try it. Well....I used it twice and sadly to say, it's going back to the store.The first time I made a batch of oatmeal cookies. Creaming the ingredients was fine, but as soon as I got the flour and oatmeal in the mix, the mixer and bowl started rocking and jerking as the mix hit the beaters. Decided I can't turn away from that for a second! The second time was a coffee cake batter, smooth & creamy and no rocking this time, but the bowl wouldn't spin to mix the batter. Plus then I started to get the overheated motor smell.Not sure what I'll get now cause I really don't want to spend $200+ on a mixer, but this one wasn't it."
2,Only good for mixing a cake!,"This is a honey if all you want to do is make a simple cake mix. I tried creaming butter and sugar and all it does is sling everything to the sides! Thank goodness I had just bought a Kitchenaid hand mixer, I finished up my cookie dough with that and it handled that with ease! Don't bother with this one, save up for a Kitchenaid stand mixer, that's what I'm going to do!!"
3,Barely Satisfied,"I received the 2364 model as a gift about a year and a half ago -- after one or two uses, the button that tilts the top back broke, so I have to stick my finger in the hole to get it to tilt. The motor has kind of a 'hot' smell, and it has smoked before while mixing some heavier cookie dough. The beaters don't scrape the sides of the bowl & the base barely spins. I usually spin the bowl myself. However, it is still serving its purpose & I use it fairly often."
5,Fantastic Movie-One ALL Lesbians Should See...,"This is one of the best lesbian movies of all time! Provocative and funny, witty and smart. The identification with each character is amazing and refreshing! Can't say enough about this movie... WATCH IT! You'll be pleasantly surprised!"
3,Decent purchase,I love mother-of-pearl stones and this ring held up pretty well until one day the stone came off. I had to crazy glue it back in place. I'm glad no one can tell. Other than that it's a pretty good looking sterling silver ring.
4,Nice set,"Used this to complete front end work on my vintage car. Very good set, especially for the price. I was dealing with parts that have been attached for 40 years; only slight mushrooming on the handle. I have not used the pneumatic aspect of it but I don't see why it would't work so ling as the compressor can provide the air. Would not recommend for everyday use (although it could last) but a great set for a DIY mechanic."
4,Amazing tale of near-death turning to life,"It is amazing Sullaway lived to tell this tale and we, the readers, benefit by getting to tag along from the comfort of our couches. You don't have to be a sailor to be enthralled by this tale of a woman who runs away to find herself. Armchair explorers and true adventurers alike will appreciate this book."
1,Who are these characters?,So many names. So many digressions. So much gratuitous cussing.Who are all these people? Why do they each have a name and four nicknames?This writing is so self-absorbed that the story is virtually incomprehensible.
2,Not Worth the Wait,"All you have to know about this book and how much the author knows about boxing, is this: Nick Tosches stated that Archie Moore threw his fight with Rocky Marciano. Moore, if he were to thow a fight could have found a bit easier way of doing so than than taking the pounding he did from the Rock. Just watch the last three rounds of the fight and you tell me if this was a thrown fight. Fair or not, this one seemingly innocuous passage, lost total credibility of the author for me. I paid for this book and now regret it. If you want good stuff on Liston from credible sources (though you may no agree with everything they write) read William Nack' SI piece, Nigel Collins' Boxing Babylon or The HBO documentary on Liston. Tosches may have done some incredible research here, but I don't view him as a reliable source."
4,"Scattered, but compelling read.","Another fine Nick Tosches biography. Tosches is not for everybody as style invades substance with much more frequency than classic biographies. However, the style fits the oddball subject here. Liston, an illiterate with a minor past, doesn't offer a lot of meat to deal with. Tosches still creates a fascinating book that wanders among the facts and provides an interesting insight to boxing and odd corners of the US experience. I do like Tosches' biographies infinitely more than his fiction."
1,Hardly a biography or even a book about boxing,"This was the most tedious book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Having read dozens of boxing biographies, I was thrilled to see that someone had chosen to write about Sonny Liston. Liston was larger than life in every way, he was the original bad-ass of boxing. However, what Nick Tosches decides to concentrate his efforts on is....uhhh....I have no idea what he is concentrating on. The guy is all over the place, but generally spending most of his time on inane and trivial matters that no Liston or boxing fan would care about. Seriously, this guy is an awful writer. I'm not sure if he considers himself a bad-ass as well, but I would love to meet him and tell him what a lousy writer he is. Certainly if Sonny was alive today, he would have given this guy a beating for screwing up his biography."
2,boring,How did he write such a boring book about such an interesting character. Very little about the fights or fighhters of the era.
4,Elephant in the Room,Patrice O'neal passed away after this show. To talented not to make it bigger than he got. RIP Patrice.The DVD is hilarious I recommend adding this to your library
5,Great Product Bad Shipment,"Missed my needed delivery date for a Play rehearsal. I paid for Priority shipping and it took 5 days. The product gets 5 stars, shipping gets no stars. I should be reimbursed for my non Priority shipping."
2,Where? What? Why?,"Where is the story? There is plenty of action but no continuous story. I loved the different scenery, but why? The action makes it worth the low price, but their really was no there there. What was the deal with Mac ""the Maniac"" soldier? Why did they not show the completion of Hutch's fight with the railway goliath? One minute they are fighting and the next Hutch joins his compatriots on the empty train. If we have a nuclear menace, then it always helps if he enacts some major destruction in the beginning of the movie to enhance the threat. Too many times I was asking who was shooting at who? Decent action movie, but why? Loved the ending though-the tension build up and the sadness."
3,"Nice Ship Time, Wrong item advertised.","This product arrived pretty quickly, but the pictured item is different than what I received. At any rate I am keeping it even though I like the pictured product better than what I received."
5,"....from the past 20 years.....and still is ""THE BEST""!!!!","This CD just stands out among others power metal CD's. All we are witnesses how many power metal bands we have around nowdays. The others talk about Helloween, Hamerfall, Stratovarious, Gamma Ray, Symphony X, Primal Fear, etc.,etc., but this FACTORY is in the same level with Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept and with this CD, RW simply beats their all the best CD's with BHI!!!"
5,"excellent reputation, excellent performance","Channel Vision has a reputation for high quality, and after 6 months of use, I have to agree. I hooked this simple splitter up under my house, and it's been flawless ever since. I didn't need to include a signal booster, and have no problems with basic, digital, and cable modem signals. Channel Vision has one of the lowest signal (decibel) losses of any 4-way splitter. I even left one port open to the weather for a couple months, and recently switched my cable modem to it, and it works great :)"
5,Love this tool box for my 5-yr-old,"All our boys, at 5, get their own real tool set. This is the PERFECT tool box. It's the perfect size, durable, etc. My son will get out his tools and ""fix"" things in the yard, usually a couple things we've designated that he can ""fix"" so that he gets practice working with his tools. This tool box is holding up great. We got it because my 14 yr old also has this tool box, in red, and also got his at age 5. His little red tool box is still in good use! I hope this black one holds up just as well."
4,"good quality,durabily","shipped in very short time, arrived in good condition.This toolbox is just as described,good construction, good finish,and well made all over. Agood size for a truck,or utv."
3,Looks beautiful---painful to walk in!!,Very beautiful shoe....but very painful in which to walk any type of distance at all....very pointy toes and rigid soles....makes walking seem like torture.
3,Fairly a nice recording.,"This album was pretty nice and all, but why they won't release this group's first album on cd, i don't know. ""This must be heaven"" and Lovin' is really my Game"" was some pretty solid seventies recordings. I guess one day in my lifetime, the record companies will completely get on their jobs and start releasing the stuff that they should onto compact disc. After all, this is the cd age now."
3,Not Impressed,"I purchased this not as a moisturizer but as a salicylic acid product. Salicylic acid is generally useful for exfoliating and preventing/getting rid of blackheads and whiteheads. 2% strength (as this product has) is one of the strongest sold over the counter. I chose this product because Paula Begoun (""the cosmetics cop"") notes that it has a low pH, which would make it a more effective exfoliant--salicylic acid products with high pHs do not work well.Although (contrary to popular belief) moisturizers themselves do not necessarily cause breakouts, this product made me break out. I developed small whiteheads all over my forehead. I don't think it moisturized very well, but that wasn't a concern to me as I was using it as a vehicle for salicylic acid. It also has a rather unpleasant fragrance.I stopped using it after one week, as it didn't seem to help, and did seem to do harm."
1,body by bellydance: a workout targeting the female fat zones,"I shadow dancer purchased this product with high hopes, I own several bellydance for weight loss and better bodies along with the instructional dvds. Iam a bellydancing nut I love it. But this tape was not for me. Iam a intermediate dancer, I own all of Rania's bellydance for weight loss. Although not a fan of Rania's dancing(I find it a bit Robotic) I do like her weight loss dvds because they make you sweat. But this dvd was short, instructional but no real follow-up workout after the instruction, it was pure boring!!! Then to put insult in injury she goes into pilates mode, I didnot but a bellydance workout tape to do pilates i wanted a full 30minutes/1 hour of straight dance with the options of additional execrise. You donot get that here, if that is what you want try Temple of Jehan or Shape up n Hip out with Jillina. These are EXCELLENT n Enjoy the true bellydance Girls but not with this tape!!!Shadow dancer"
3,Not all its cracked up to be,"After I read so many of the reviews, I though I would really like this DVD. Its unfortunate that I don't. Since I paid money I'll keep and try to use now and then, but I think Neena and Veena do a much better job. I will give one credit that the modified dance moves do target some areas that I wouldn't otherwise be able to target. Overall, I'm not thrilled with the DVD, but its good enough to keep."
4,Explains why,This book is particularly strong on explaining the theories behind the different fabric types and why they react as they do to dyes and paints. Some of the instructions are very clear and good photos of stamps and other printing techniques. I found the finished items and cloth a bit messy - not really my style. But a good addition to the library.
3,Great Format - Poor Content,"The learning technique is excellent. It's a bit difficult at times not ""seeing"" the words - especially when you get to France and see things written you only heard. But, after the 8 lessons (version I bought only has 8 lessons, not 16), I now know how to approach a complete stranger and ask them if they would like to get something to eat or drink and we can go to the hotel or my place for some beer or wine. Not the French content I was looking for to help me get by! I would like to learn some useful french content like how to order food or shop, as well as numbers so I can pay for my food!"
4,Nice Watch on Price,I bought this watch from Fossil outlet in 2008 in $50 and continiously wearing this since last 3 yrs.It completely black and till now its working great. Just changed the battery once 1 yr back.
1,Don't Be Fooled by the Title - Not worth the buy......,This book was terribly written and not helpful at all to me. The only part that was interesting was the few interviews he did with raw foodists at the back of the book. This book will not teach you the things you need to become a raw foodist. I much prefer Frederic Patenaude's books.
5,Loving every minute of this CD.,"when was the last time I heard A poet who could actually sing, who could actually write poetry so that they still sound like good lyrics? And the brother's not even trying to pass himself off as a rapper!"
4,Pleasant surprise,"I wasn't expecting much when I checked out this movie...and lo and behold, it turned out to be a winner. A real suspense ride from beginning to end. Adam Baldwin does his brothers proud with his updated take on the classic characters of Jekyll and Hyde. The Hong Kong-style action tries hard...and succeeds most of the time. A real standout in this mystical, HK-set action flick is Steve Bastoni as a Chicago cop running rogue in Asia and the legendary Anthony Wong. Music is strong. Directing is good. Writing is top notch. All in all it was well worth my time."
4,Um...,"Quick thing to the last reviewer. Adam can't do his brothers proud- HE'S NOT A BALDWIN BROTHER. Take it from someone who carpools with his kids, that mistake ticks him off"
3,Just a little more,"The manual is great, though I wish it would be just a bit more extensive. I understand the datedness, but this is the edition that was required. I would have perferred a later edition. Otherwise it met my purposes."
2,Are Cliff Roberts and David Owen related?,"This is a wonderfully researched book and well written as you'd expect from Mr. Owen, and I enjoyed reading it. But wondered if I was the only one who thought it was ruined by the obsessive desire to defend Cliff Roberts, even on matters that really seem pointless. So I came here to read reviews and I couldn't help but notice that many of the glowing reviews here on Amazon appeared to be written by the same person, but I was glad to see some agreed with me about the format of the book. I suppose it's a must for the pictures if you want to see the course the way it once was, but I recommend avoiding it if you get irritated with a book that has an agenda and seems to go out of its way to not just tell the story, but to address issues that someone wanted addressed."
2,A Clifford Roberts Love-In,"Too bad the wonderful nuggets about Augusta that Owens has dug up are mired in a non-stop paean to Clifford Roberts. Examples of Robert's usually controversial, sometimes appalling behavior seem brought up for the express purpose of explaining them away, and then always with a very sympathetic eye. It often reads that the only way Owens got so much good 'behind-the-scenes' info from Augusta was by agreeing to write a soft, agreeable portrait of the club co-founder.That being said, it is still an interesting read. Owens' writing and research are first-rate, and his debunking of early Masters mythology is especially interesting. However fans more interested in tourney lore (the 'Masters' part of the title) should look elsewhere."
2,ok as a drama only,"Nice little drama about the ol' family not accepting the gay daughter or her lover. It's ok but don't be fooled by the erotic packaging. This would barely be rated an R. You basically just get some kissing and a real downer ending. If you're looking for a romance or a steamy film, this isn't it."
2,Nothing ever happens!!!,"I hate to trash lesbian flicks but I fell asleep twice trying to get through this one. The gist of the movie is this: rich chick has a hard time breaking away from family expectations and girlfriend gets ticked off. I woke up after the second attempt to watch it and asked ""What happened?"" - the response - ""Nothing was resolved"". I did get a couple of good naps in."
3,"Decent movie, bad editing","All the scenes would just get cut at the end, the transformation to each new scene was really bad. Otherwise the film had a good story, good actors. My favorite was the straight friend from out of town, she was great. This film could have been really good with better editing and better music."
2,Don't Bother,Boring and WAY over dramatic. Glad I rented it first.I was really let down because I do like the stars of the show.
5,Wild Wood,Because anything that Weller does is 100 % better than most of his so called peers. People in the U.S. may not know much about him but Weller has been producing important music for more than 20 years.
5,Unbelievable,"This is some of the most fantastic music I have ever heard. The singing is done with incredible passion, and I do mean passion. From the gut. The music is awesome. Some of these songs make you want to get up and dance, others leave you with a tear, and some of the sounds simple speak to your soul. It did take awhile to get this cd, but the wait was DEFINITELY worth it! Gets my vote."
5,Great CD,I had seen this CD when I was in Scotland but at the time I didn't really think much of it so I did not buy it. I was in Scotland in early May of this year. My brother bought one there and he said it was great so I looked around at my local music stores and of course no one had it. So I went to Amazon. com and ordered it and WOW!!! what a CD I highly reccomend it. 17 songs on a CD it's like there greatest hits CD. Wonderful.
5,Awesome,"I love this product. I use to add shine and softness after flat ironing, and it works wonderfully. Why it's $13 on here, I don't know. Retail is $5-6..."
4,Inspiring,"Abby and John went through the best and worst of times. With their daughters' marriage coming, they needed to postpone their divorce, and their feelings. This book shows the emotional ups and downs of the couple, and their thoughts on if going through what had once never crossed their minds, was the best option. Their ability to reconnect with God and their faith shows their strength and determination to make things right. A time to dance is a dramatic book that will range in emotions, but ultimately leave you smiling for days."
5,I miss you: a first look at death,Reviewer's book:Overcoming Loss: Activities and Stories for Children Who Have Experienced Grief and LossThis beautifullly illustrated book has a gentle story about loss and the feelings associated with it for young children.
3,not for a lustbader fan,"the books of mr.Lustbader have something different from the others:a way of seeing things unusual.This book has nothing like this.By far his best ones were JIAN and SHAN.Anyway,i'm still one of his fans"
2,too wordy,"I purchased this book for my daughter who is in 10th grade gifted english. This is what the teacher wanted the children to purchase. However, only a few pages into the book, she decided it was too difficult to read. So instead, she purchased Hunchback of Notre Dame, Bantam Classics out of her own pocket for the class.The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Bantam Classics)"
2,"Coulda, shoulda, wish it woulda, been good...","I was drawn to the Punisher comic books when I was younger and never had any qualms about how Frank Castle treated anyone he thought needed ""punishing"". Also, I liked Ray Stevenson in Rome, so I was really hoping this would be a good romp on the wild side. It just wasn't though. This might sound weird beyond belief, but it was just too immature to be good (weird since these types of movies are expected to be on the immature side.) It reminded me a bit of the Batman Forever movie. Most of the action scenes are good since they aren't chopped up and jerky like a lot of action movies these days, which is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one. Wish I could say I liked it better. If you're male between the ages of 15 and 25 and get turned on by seeing tons of guns, you may get more out of this. Otherwise, I'd say wait till it gets put on Prime."
4,Punisher... the way it should be,This is how the Punisher is supposed to be done. Violence coming out the a**. It's how it is in the comics and this film captured it nicely. Sadly Marvel did not promote this film in the way that they should have...so it just came and went. Hopefully it will find better success on dvd.Shame on you Marvel....though the film was very good...you dropped the ball big time.
1,A Twisted Movie,This was a movie of twisted and very little intelligent thought. I would recommend it to no one. The grotesque vilence should have made it an x rated film.
1,the big lie,i got this movie as a gift on the cover it said its the two disc special edition the one i want but i got a bad surprise when i open it there is just one disc inside woooow how dare thats sucks so if someone is intereset in this movie becareful its not two disc inside so the packed is a big lie
4,Finally a good Punisher movie!,"Is simply beyond belief that it took 3 tries to deliver a decent punisher movie, but is here and is quite cool. Granted is very, very gory and bloody but what could you expect after the previous 2 fiascos, is kinda like alien vs predator 2, you wanted violence, well you got it. The story is decent, the actor for both punisher and jigzaw nailed right in the head. Perhaps a little more style and less blood would have been better, any way is worth a look. But remember this is not for kids at all!!!!!"
4,Best Punisher To Date!,"In my opinion, this is the BEST Punisher movie of the three. It is of the caliber synonymous to the comic books, and that alone for me is good enough. While viewing this at the cinema, I couldn't help but think ""finally here is a Punisher movie worth watching"". The plot is simple; that is, a revenge/vigilante tale with the protagonist wanting to quit his current purpose and so on, but had to brutally extinguish some impious miscreants on his way. I don't see viewers who are familiar with the comics having a problem with this film, but for those who aren't, please do your research before and don't go in expecting Batman. In fact, I really think this is exactly what Batman does; just that he has all that money for non lethal weaponry. Anyway, this kick a...s action movie was directed by a woman and I'm very proud of her, Thank You Lexi Alexander!!!"
5,Awesome,Quit debating if you should put it in your cart and just buy the damn movie already.Thanks for your time.
4,pretty good,"was a double sided DVD, was suspicious at first because it seemed like it may have been a burned copy, still am skeptical. but otherwise, fantastic price, and super fast shipping. loved it!"
5,I love it!!!!!,"I absolutely loved this game. Once I started it, I could not stop playing. The only annoying thing is how long it takes in the beginning to start, but once it does it's so much fun. One of my friends told me about it and since I love Disney, I thought I would try it. And now I am impatiently waiting Kingdom Hearts 2. So all of you out there, even though you may be skeptical, try it, its a GREAT game!!!!"
2,I only gave it two stars because I love the second one!!!,"This game was really not that great,I played it thinking that I would love it,but whenever I started playing it,I didn't like it,you can't move you screen which is a HUGE handicap,the gummi ships are bad because you have to put them together piece by piece which takes time and sometimes it won't let you do it.The game is also very hard,I love anything that has to do with Kingdom Hearts but this was a letdown."
4,Kids love it!,I think this game was really good but a little pricey.It has Disney Characters for 8 year olds but a real good story line and good fights for 10-14 year olds.
3,Not my favorite.,"Not my favorite rpg, but isn't as bad as I thought. I wrote a review that was scathing, but have since learned that my feelings were misguided. It has great potential. I feel that it is still lacking in areas."
1,¡¡¡¡¡¡¡NTSC sold worldwide!!!!!!!!,Do you really think anyone can read NTSC on the product image?????This products are abosulutely no use if you aren't on a NTSC area and this is perfectly detectable before allowing to sell it to these countries.That's my case.I feel cheated.
4,IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL ...,"I really enjoyed this game! It was so much fun to go exploring through the different Disney worlds!The only thing I strongly reccomend is that you get the strategy guide or you will be wandering aimlessly through the different worlds.You play as Sora from ""Final Fantasy"" (you also have friends form ""Final Fantasy"" as well, but you don't get to play them), and you meet Donald and Goofy who help you on your quest to stop the Heartless from taking over the various worlds. This game is challenging but fun, and you never know who you'll run into!"
3,Stop using this like a forum!,"(...) I didn't enjoy this game, that much cos it was hard to understand, and seemed complex. I thought that final fantasy seven was more enjoyable, however Cloud, Aerith, Cid and Yuffie are appeared so that really made me like it, but I CANNOT STAND THE GUMMI SHIPS I MEAN WHATS THE POINT IN IT!!!! A fairley average game not as good as expected though, it vwas too short for a square enix game."
5,Greatest game ever!,"When I first heard about Kingdom Hearts, I seriously thought it would be stupid, I mean, when you see you play along side Donald and Goofy, two klutzy Disney characters, my first thought was ""Yea Right!"" Then my boyfriend highly recommended it, so I thought since he says its good, why don't I give it a shot? Man, am I ever glad I did! This game is great! The graphics are amazing, the music are awesome and the storyline is just plain great! You can't get any better then Kingdom Hearts in my opinion! Only problem I had with it is the camera angles, but I guess not everything can be perfect. I was so sad when I finally beat it and I am hoping against hope that they will make a sequel to the game cause they left it wide open for a sequel!"
4,"Great overall, but not a ten.","This was a fun game, but it was missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. The story, characters, battles, gameplay, and everything else was good, but there is just something missing. I would have liked it if the game was longer, had more worlds, and you could build your characters up more. Maybe that was the issue, the game was plenty long but since I liked it so much I wanted it longer. I guess I am just greedy.The only thing I didn't like about the game was that your overall game time continues to count up even when you have the game paused. I would be playing and pause the game to make dinner, talk on the phone, watch TV, or whatever, but the clock kept on ticking. So my thirty or so hours of play that it took me to finish the game shows up as fifty something and my wife thinks I have ""wasted"" over two full days on the game!"
4,don't waste your money,this game stinks i have 21 games and this is the worste game i have ever played. pac man world 2 is better then kingdome hearts
4,Kingdome Hearts,"Kingdom Hearts was a good game. The downside to it was swing the key around. It got old. I was also annoyed with how you traveled from world to world in your cheeeeeesy gummy ship. Well enough of the bad now to the good. Magic is pretty goood in this game, but I used physical attacks mostly. Most of the game was fairly simple but some of the battles were hard and took a while. Overall I give the game a 4 out of 5."
1,This is INSANE.,"Kingdom Hearts has been out for a couple of weeks. I haven't been able to find it ANYWHERE. A N Y W H E R E!!!I'm obsessed with the music. I love the cutscenes I've seen so far. The gameplay looks awesome. Everyone I know who has played it has loved it, and 99/100 of the internet community loves it too (Cept the whiny morons who can't get over the camera-thing).If you haven't bought this game because you have something against Disney, or against Square, GET OVER IT AND BUY IT! All these billions of people can't be wrong!(The 1-star rating is for the fact that I only get to see it through other people. I never get to play it myself cause none of the rental places ever have it in, and I haven't enough money to purchase it... not that they're findable for purchase either...)"
4,Awesome,"This game is pretty fun, I like that it's a long journey that's more like a movie than a game. I like that it has lots of unlockables, but the graphics are okay, seeing how that game came out in 2002. Overall it's really fun to play!!"
4,Great Game until...,This game was great until I got to the Hercules level where you have to smash barrels. Wow is that stupid! Why ruin a great game with dumb stuff like that!I mean it's a role playing game with a barrel smashing level? not to mention that its hard as hell to get all the barrels in the time limit.This game only gets 4 stars becuse I think they ruined the game with that level.Stupid mini games are not fun and make games...BR>If you are going to have mini games make them fun at least?
4,Not that much hype,"The game was pretty awesome from the start of the game. What I really liked about the game is that there are quite a few sidequests. The Coliseum was a great addition to the game because the hardest boss is actually on this sidequest. However, I did think the game was a little short despite what people are saying about the game even with doing all of the sidequests. I do agree though that this game was not much like an rpg, in that you only have control over one character and most of the time you are just hitting the X button to hit the enemy. Also the magic was not very impressive because there weren't too many types of magic and the magic was not very powerful even at the highest level of 100. Overall the game was still a lot of fun and probably not worth the $49.99, but I just figured that was because of the 2 creators Disney and Squaresoft and the cool cut-scenes throughout the game."
3,Its Okay For a little while,At first it was such a cool game but as you play it you losses instress. The levels get boring NO FUN! Its really easy. As I said the first few weeks you think it's the best game in the world but it gets boring after that. Rent it a couple of times. But I subjest don't buy it. It is a waste of money.
5,"Fantastic, A tribute to both Square and Disney!!!","You need only one word to describe this game. Incredible! Anyone who considers themself an RPG fan is going to love this game. Anyone who grew up loving Disney will be blown away. The game itself is simple enough. The hero has to save his friends and the world(s), leveling up and learning new magic and skills along the way. The interface is easy to use making this game great for younger children. The sidequests and mini-games have great detail to the disney stories and while some are simple others are quite challenging. The music and graphics are fantastic, but you shouldn't expect anything less from Squaresoft. Get this immediately. You will not be sorry. I am already playing it through a second time. :)"
1,Fluffy Wuffy Disney junk,"I had a bad feeling something like this would happen. After playing through Final Fantasy X, I realized that the characters were annoying and childish. Now, with the release of Kingdom Hearts, we see where Squaresoft is heading. They are targeting a much younger audience now (5-13 years old), and as such, Square has turned away from making good role-playing games that require thought and skill to master. Kingdom Hearts is an OK Disney animated movie, with some RPG-style battles using magic (almost exactly like that annoying Pokemon/DragonBall Z/ etc..) I rented it, and was quite annoyed with the fact that Disney characters keep appearing. From the reviews I have read, it seems that everyone loves this game. I think many of these reviewers have never played a true RPG, like the ones that were very popular from 1988-1994. I suggest people avoid this game, simply because it is just another Disney product, very watered down and predictable."
2,Differs from the fan version,"this game is bland compared to the fan version( not fan fic ) of final mix. The camera is suprisingly dfficult unlike ff and disney games and the fighting system was diffucult to understand.I don't understand the meaning og gummi ships either.this game is as terible as ashlee simpsons lyp syncing nightmare, I reccomened the fan version which dosn't sell on here better than this. its average but how can sora cope without her or riku without his girlfriend:Nainme Spears."
4,The Best RPG ever!,"Believe me, this is the very best game! Graphics are stunning, gameplay is very good, and the tie-in between Squaresoft and Disney is oddly amusing. Though it may be very hard even on the normal setting, eventually, you will win. This is no oridaniry game... It is far better than any normal game! Should be rated in the Top 10!"
4,KINGDOM HEARTS: THE BEST GAME YET!,"I rented this game and couldn't put the controller down! I am planning on buying this soon. This game is so long that I wasn't able to make it past the first ring of worlds (Deep Jungle, Wonderland, Traverse Town, and Coliseam) This is a challenging game that is great for all ages."
5,"Graphics, Storyline....legend","The graphics are how do I put this? BETTER than real life! lol I have never seen such detail! The graphics are better than Final Fantasy! and the game-play is addicting! It was more fun than Jak and Daxter! (Better graphics too!) The storyline is truly touching. I am serious I practicly cried in the end. Plus traveling to all the different worlds, is much fun. There are worlds filled with turmoil, and battles..but then there's the wimsicle world of Winnie The Pooh..peacful and simple.Not to mention the soundtrack.....! The re-play value is amazing.. and so are the secrets. There are so many secrets! loldefinately a MUST own. Also, there is a secret ending! (also amazing) with graphics even BETTER. lets cross our fingers and hope for a sequel."
4,Excellent!,"It's amazing that some people still think this game is for toddlers. If you think that then try versing Ansem or Spepthiroth, or Maleficent or Hades. These bosses are quite hard and the gameplay is amazing."
4,Awesome Concept and Fighting system!!,"In my opinion, I think anyone with a liking to action games or rpg's will like this because its both combined. You get many Disney characters in your party and you battle all the time. The story line is great and the cinemas aren't too long except the beginning. The bosses get cooler and dark as you get to the end, but I'm not gonna spoil it ;). So just get this game its really really worth it you won't be dissapointed!"
5,Another great game by a great company!,"this game is really good. it has a good challang. good story line. good battle system. graphics are fair. over-all the game is good and fun but it can be hard if you don't have your chariter leveled up high. for the battle system when a bad guy pops up on screen the battle begins and there are alot of battles. And if you do some stuff (like getting all 99 or 100 puppes) you can see a video for the 2nd kingdom hearts game,(which is really cool).But if you do not i dsiney very much you may not like this game very much..."
2,Sadly disappointed,"I thought Disney's involvement would pretty much guarantee a solid gaming experience, but no. Sure, the cut-scene animations are great, and it's cool to see all the Disney characters--but otherwise, it's hard to figure out who's supposed to like this game! The gameplay is way too simplistic and repetitive for serious gamers, but it's too slow-paced, too map-based, and ultimately just not imaginative enough to hold the interest of most kids--or even us boring grownups for that matter :).Underneath it all, Kingdom Hearts is a very second-rate RPG with little to recommend it aside from its cool animation and its Disney cameos. Is it worth 50 bucks? No. If you're excited about seeing Disney characters onscreen, your money would be better spent on your Disney DVD collection."
1,Embarrasing,"This game is an embarrasment to video games and Disney. With todays games, who wants to control movies, its just stupid. Disney needs to stick with making movies and cut it uout with the dorky video games."
3,Not Bad,NCAA College Football 2k3 is a good game. I would say it's a great game but it has some bad points. First the A.I. it you put the A.I. on walk-on you will win by 30 points almost everytime but then when you put it on starter for a challenge it's very hard to win and isn't very fun becuase you have to try so hard to win. If you want a real challenge play a friend. They plays are great but it will take a while to get use to the passing and without a training mode it doesn't really teach you how. As for running the running is great it's very easy. Create a school it really great becuase you can coach them up to 30 seasons. Besides for those bad points. This game is really fun if you can get used to the bad points. EA College Football 2003 is going to offer you a more rewarding experience but the price of NCAA College football 2k3 can't be beat!!
1,The title is fitting because this movie is a joke,"This movie was 82 minutes of nothing,anything that might be scary happens in complete darkness, you see none of it,complete waste of time."
2,"Great Graphics, Cool Weapsons, TOO HARD!","It's almost impossible to beat. Five minutes into the game, I die. Total frustration"
1,This is your father's Van Halen,"While this band was a driving force in it's beginning, the fire that was instilled into the band left with its original lead singer. Love ballads covered this entire album. Ripping, inventive guitar was replaced by sappy synthesizers, and Eddie went from guitar wizard to mediocre pop star. This band changed after Dave left, and not for the better. If you want to rock, get Van Halen's first 6 albums, and David Lee Roth's solo albums (especially Eat 'Em And Smile and Skyscraper with Steve Vai, and his latest DLR Band). They carry the original Van Halen attitude.They definitely should have changed the name to Van Hagar."
3,This is like a diet drink.,"Taking David Lee Roth out of Van Halen is like taking the sugar out of a Pepsi- it's just not quite the same.This is still better than the vast majority of hard rock out there, but to me, Van Halen was never the same once Roth left.I also like Sammy Hagar's solo stuff better than his Van Halen stuff."
1,What is this crap?,"As everyone else, I was shocked when I heard that Diamond Dave was out. I decided to listen the Sammy stuff, though, and I have to confess that I was terribly disappointed! The people who claim a change was necessary and there will never be another Van Halen I album miss the point. Of course there will never be another VH I album, but the problem is that quality is gone. It is not because an artist has to evolve all the time not to spend his/her life playing the same tunes that he/she is to start playing worthless music. I think it is impossible to enjoy this record if you already know what was done before."
4,Good debut,"This is the first VH record with sammy on vocals. This is their biggest selling album with sammy as the singer. It went 6x platnium. They did changer their soung quite a bit. Love walks in and dreams and why cant this be love, which all are hit singles is a departure from the usually rock sound of diamond dave, but they do have a good rockin tune Summer Nights"
1,Had to return it,"This backpack looked good for the price, but seemed a little bit small for my 10 yr old daughter's large load of books. The pink color was very pretty, but I imagined it would get filthy within a short time. I also doubted the fabric would hold up long under the tough wear it would get. I ended up returning it as soon as we got it out of the package because the wheels rattled. I went to Target and bought a wheeled backpack there for $19.99, which tore within the first week, so she's using my non-wheeled backpack for now. Hopefully we'll be able to find a good one for a good price at Walmart before the start of the next school year."
3,Disappointing,"_The Ravishing of Lol Stein_ tells the story of a woman who watches her fiance abandon her for another woman and feels compelled to reenact the tragedy in later life.It's a compelling premise, but I found myself curiously unmoved by the characters and ultimately by the writing itself-- it seemed too inflated with its own sense of tragedy and pathos and I felt like a crucial sense of humor was somehow missing from the situation.I used to really enjoy Duras when I would read her in my early twenties, so I'm not sure if it was the individual book that I didn't like, or whether I've just lost my taste for the emotional drama that she specializes in as a writer."
4,A good book,"This is a good book, maybe not as good as some of her books and the hero is not too appealing to me. But overall an enjoyable read."
3,Not up to Others,"I have enjoyed Susanna Kearsley's books in the past and so was looking forward to this one. However, it was not up to others I have read. The plot moved along, but there were few surprises, and the characters were not memorable. Also, it lacked the strong connection with history that I have come to enjoy in her other books."
3,Quick read,"Good fall read! Unexpected plot, sad the end wasn't what I hoped, but still a worth reading. Wish I had taken my time."
1,This company and its product is the worst,"Very, very disappointed with this product. I live in Florida, and to this day, I cannot get the home receiver/boom box to receive any signal, unless I go outside. Even in my office, which has an open bay window facing west (which is the exposure the company suggests for Florida), the product is unable to acquire a signal. The car kit works fine. When I called the company to complain, they could offer no advice at all, told me to put the antenna outside, which is very impractical at home, when my air conditioner is on, and impossible at my office, where my windows do not open. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
5,Opus Maximus,"Lisa Borders debut will be remembered for generations as a paradigm shift in the art of writing. As I read this incredibly seductive novel, I recognized a wave of comfort not felt since reading McMurty and Cormac McCarthy. Ms. Borders managed this feat while drawing me in, and spitting me out into the hyper-urban music scene. I am at a loss for words in describing this transition. The novel is a gem, and I take extreme pleasure in knowing that Ms. Borders has many years of writing ahead, which will fill out her literary tiara! Bravo!!!"
4,Very well written,"Once you start reading Tymora's Luck, you won't want to put it down. You will recognize some names from other books such as Dragon Lance novels and Forgotten Realms."
3,Glasses,"These were very inexpensive but, I suppose to be expected given the cost, kind of flimsy. I like a solid glass, and these, I'm sure, will break before long with normal wear and tear."
1,New Age Idiocy,"Shallow, mildly amusing nonsense. I'm not about to take the advice of a person who has never held down a regular job, never been married, never had kids, pays a feng shui advisor $125 an hour to tell her to put ""power rocks"" in the north corner of her house, and has life advisors with names like ""Sky"" ""SunRay"" and ""Moonbeam."" This book was OK to read while recovering from major surgery and bored out of my mind, but I wish I hadn't paid money for it. This garbage was stupid in the 60's and some things never change."
3,"Fun,..For a While","I bought both my boys one of these for Christmas and they do enjoy it and loves Nerf in general. However, the orange cap at the end falls off easily and my kids ended up weighting it down a little in the cap and super glued it back on and are still playing with it. They are boys and well kids in general can be a little destructive. Overall, not bad."
1,Maltodextrin impacts blood sugar!,"Please note that Sweet 'n Low sugar free frostings are ""sugar free."" However, if you're diabetic, you are going to ingest something that has a higher impact on raising your blood glucose than does a regular sugared frosting! Maltodextrin is the first ingredient listed on Sweet 'n Low frostings. Athletes use maltodextrin in energy drinks and foods to give them a *BURST* of glucose. My diabetic family members' postprandial glucometer readings were incredibly high after eating this. I've written the company about the impact of their product & to stop touting it as a ""must for diabetics,"" but they never responded. PLEASE, please, please realize that if you're a diabetic, eating maltodextrin is worse than eating sugar as it has a quick, rising impact on blood sugar--unhealthy for diabetics. It's your job as a consumer to be informed. I hope this helps diabetics out there who are enjoying this product not testing afterwards to see their blood glucose skyrocket."
4,It's Your Move,This looks a great game... This looks much better than the game boy color game and is set up better to. There are new monsters and magic cards in this game. And u can versus a friend with a link cable. If your a Yu-Gi-Oh fan buy this game I know I am.
4,A 13 year old monster.,"Wow! This game put you on the end of your seat.You really get going once you start playing it.I played it for 5 hours straight.I wouldn't give this game a 5, but I wouldgive it a 4.It's da big one."
4,This game is GREAT!!,I have never played this game but from what I hear it is very good. I like Yu-gi-oh
2,Good but not Great,"i bought this game pretty soon after it came out being a fan of the show i thought why not???? i was soon disappointed though yeah i'm sure the rules are all the same as the show but talk about being thrown in at the deep end. you are given a deck by some guy and that's it, work the rest out yourself.my advice is if you're a mega fan of the show then you should pick it up but if like me you're not then it might be worth a miss"
3,"Can I go kayaking for two months, Dear?","I enjoyed this book of sheer muscle and determination. However, I felt the author to be a tad bit selfish in her quest for ""finding herself"". She adopted two children who needed a stable homelife, but sadly, ended up the children of divorced parents. When I asked my husband if I could kayak for two months to ""find myself"" he thought I was being selfish; when I asked him if I wanted to go kyaking for two months with him, but he didn't want to go, he said ""go for it, but by yourself"" Go figure."
2,Blah....blah....blah.....,"This isn't an autobiography about someone challenging themselves with a journey to build strength of character, to find spiritual enlightenment, or seeking answers to life's questions.... This is the tale of a whining, self absorbed, grieving, gender confused woman, running away from the life she has. The only thing she seeks is someone to tell her its okay to dump her husband and come out of the closet. Yippie, good for you, but not an inspirational or interesting read!The book is as poorly planned out as her trip was. Improper clothing and gear, poor planning of landing/camp sites, gross misjudgments of distances, weather conditions, and abilities. The only thing amazing about her journey is that she didn't die from her own stupidity.I've kayaked on Lake Superior.... Too bad she spent so much time drifting in her own insecurities to fully enjoy the trip..... I'd scatter the book to the four winds, except that would be littering."
2,get on with it already,He's a scapegoat who she falls for. He falls too and in the process almost ruins his life. As far as comedy goes....I didn't smile once. Lead character was annoying and could have passed for 18 instead of 25 with the way she reacted to any situation. Could have spent that dollar elsewhere.
1,A world of sameness,This cd didn't move me one bit. I am glad i borrowed this cd from someone that was singing raves for this artist. I hope his next release has more innovative music instead of the usual elevator sameness of this release.
2,Boring.....,This is one of the first games I got for my xbox (Halo on order). The graphics are ok but ofter poorly rendered where the characters interact with the enviorment. The control layot is sensible but the mech is often frustrating to control on the ground and in jet mode its just plain bad. The jet responds agonizingly slow to command inputs which complicates air-air combat with targets that fly much slower than you can.Overall its 3 stars on a good day. I enjoy the weapon selection and the targeting interface that has the option to toggle auto-aim on and off. The missle trails are nicely done as are the sounds. Its a playable and fun game....just not very entertaining and pretty limited in scope.
2,Not as expected,"Make sure you check out what size you're looking for. There was nothing wrong with the product itself. It was just way to small than what I expected. I would have needed 4-5 more bags of this product to fill up my son's pit. I called around some local stores where I live to get more balls right away to fill the pit up and found a store that sold them. I went in and saw they were bigger - more of what I expected. I bought 4 bags of those balls. Before emtying the new balls in the pit, I took these balls out. Turns out I only needed 2 bags of the bigger balls (my son's pit is the size of a toddler pool). So, I get to return these balls and the 2 extra bags of the new balls I bought. Like I said, nothing defective about this product, just small."
3,Not very solid,"I thought I had read enough reviews to be happy with this purchase but even before opening the bag i could see through the clear plastic bag/container that several balls were crushed/dented. After opening and emptying the bag the balls felt made of thin plastic and easily crushable and not so easy to ""un-crush"". I would not have bought these if I had felt them before hand.So these balls are cheap, thin, and crushed/crushable.I would prefer something a little thicker."
5,Cutting Board!,"I've always wanted a good, big, thick cutting board. Now I have one! Can't wait to use it over and over again."
3,A Life to Remember,This is a story about brotherly best friends who ends up in a correctional institution who turns into throat-cutting rivals on each other.One leaves and the other stays being a target from beat downs to being broken down. This is a thrilled of a book. Read it in two days!
3,"Good simulation, but needs some work","2k3 has some good gameplay and visuals, but it still has some glaring flaws. I'll hit on the four that I think most significantly impact the game. The first one is you can't change the plays in the playbook. You can only import plays from other teams' books. Second, there is no closeup or custom camera angle available. In Madden and Fever, you can customize the view you choose to use while playing. Third, the tacking in the game is not as realistic. Ball carriers tend to fall down like bowling pins if hit from the front as opposed to being wrapped up and brought down by the effects of gravity. Finally, you can't challenge plays like you can in Madden."
4,Beautiful,"The imagery of the beach just enthralled me. I really got into the book, loving it. The end was a suprise, and I wish it never had happened. I liked the characters and another amazing book by Sparks."
1,Over-blown and predictable romance,"This book is poorly written, has no plot and one-dimensional characters. The author has taken what might have been a 3 page short story and added odd scene descriptions as if, can it be, he were writing a screenplay."
2,Disappointed until the end.,"I loved the Notebook and had anticipated Message in a Bottle for a year. I was disappointed in the emotional content, it never really grabbed me until the end. It was a very sad ending and I was surprised but it was the best part of the book."
5,Great,Was very satisfied with the condition of the book. For it being used the book was in great shape! Will order from them again!
3,"Its a better book, than a movie","Thats all I have to say of this book. Not a favorite, but its good to read."
3,A book that fell apart at the end.,"I was eager to read this novel, because I dearly love his first work, The Notebook. As I began Message In A Bottle, I immediately became engrossed by the story of Theresa and Garrett. While the concept might be a bit far-fetched, the circumstance made it seem believable. Mr. Sparks did an excellent job developing these characters, just as he had done with The Notebook. Unfortunately, it seems to me that about two/thirds of the way through the story--he got distracted and lost focus. He no longer seemed to know how his characters would behave in a particular scenario and the book fell apart. The ending was weak at best, which left me disappointed and confused. This author has great talent and I hope that his future works will be more completely developed to provide a satisfying conclusion. I want to add that I am not just saying this because the ending was sad; I'm not. The Notebook also had a sad ending and it was beautiful. Overall, it fell short of expectations."
2,Huge let down!,"After reading The Notebook, I was really looking forward to this one. I found the story and characters to be boring. The only part I really enjoyed was was the ending. I hope that if Mr. Sparks contiues to write the books get better."
5,Crying on Mother's Day...,"Although I have not read The Notebook, it was by shear chance that the library had a copy of Message in a Bottle in...I started it on May 9th and by Mother's Day, it was done. Here I am, this sappy teenager, crying at our dinner at a restaurant...but anyway, I found it to be a good storyline but I feel that the lanuguage was a little elementary. I hear The Notebook also involoves letters, so maybe Sparks is trying to re-live his fame, but hey, I liked it, it kept me interested, and now I am on to The Notebook."
1,Incredibly Bad. Don't Buy It.,"This guy obviously had only one good book in him. Characterization is horrid, voice uninspired, plot stupid."
5,A love story for all to read,"Having read Notebook, which I enjoyed but found a little too sentimental, I was hungry for more of Nicholas Sparks. Message in a Bottle was the answer. I enjoyed it more than Notebook because the characters were more realistic. Also because I am familiar with the N. C. coastline where Garret resides, it hit home. With so much violence and hate in the world, I think we do sometimes overlook what could have been because we are unwilling to change our lives and get involved with other people. Admit it, we are all into a daily rut. Read this book and escape the rut for a while."
2,Unbelievable dialogue,"I should have guessed that Mr. Sparks' second novel would not be rich in dialogue, based on what I saw in his first novel. I'm still dumbfounded by the whole premise of the book. If you put a message in a bottle, isn't it obvious that SOMEONE will read the message, and your inner most secrets will be known by SOMEONE ELSE? I'm glad I only bought the paperback."
5,Simply--the best!,"Here i was thinking this book was going to be completely boring, however, when i kept reading, it really got the best of my curiousity. I had the best vry in my life, and i love it so much that i have read it 6 times, and will keep on reading it. I also recommend ""A Walk To Remember"". I can't wait till the next book comes out!"
2,Promising love story that fizzled to a ridiculous ending.,"A pointless,sappy,love story with a twisted ending that made me want to stuff the book in a bottle and throw it out to sea!"
3,"Not Great - Not Bad, just ... Mundane","After reading this book, I have to admit, I found myself thinking this was yet another example of a man writing a romance novel and it getting touted as ""literature."" Why is it women write books every bit as good -- only with happy endings -- and people call it trash? I don't get it.I suspect that if this manuscript had had a happy ending, this would have fit nicely in the romance section, which is a compliment, despite peoples' scathing comments about Fabio covers. However, I do have to admit, I found the plot a bit contrived, and the characters almost, but not quite, one dimensional. Also, the dialogue didn't move the story forward nor sound natural in several places. This impeded my enjoyment as it kept popping me out of the story.Overall, I think my title says it all: not bad, but not great."
2,LET-DOWN!,"I loved the Notebook, but not this. I found the story very predictable and obvious. The story lacked the depth of the Notebook. While I met the author here in Baltimore, and he felt this was the better of the two books, I respectfully disagree. I will give him another chance on the next book, since the Notebook touched me."
3,Easy reading,"I found it to be a simple romance story. While the story was sweet and made me cry at times, I felt the characters could have been better developed. The storyline came together too conveniently and easily. Overall, I would recommend it if you were in the mood for easy reading."
4,Deeply moving and wonderfully romantic. What love is ...,What an incredible change from all the sex and violence in most best sellers today. This beautiful novel left my heart with such a sense of what love really is all about. It is unbelievable that a man is responsible for writing such a moving love story. I recommend this to anyone who would like to have a good cry and feel a warm feeling of warmth and love!
5,Highly recommended.,This is a very touching story with a suprise ending. I highly recommend it.They have made a movie of this that has just been released. My husband and I plan to see it the first of the week!!
1,The most boring and sappy bunch of drivel that I have ever,"read. Oh boy. Now I know why I have not missed much by not reading the ""Best Sellers"". Bring on the non-fiction!"
1,One star is too generous!,"I'm glad I read many of the customer reviews before penning my own. I was afraid I'd be the only person on the planet who thought this was the most trite, banal, boring, insipid pieces of writing I'd come across in years. Just confirms what I've believed for a long time - we've sunk to the LOWEST common denominator in taste. I would have put Teresa out of her misery by page 10! Aye, the dialogue! Only positive thing to come out of my reading this empty shell of a book was that I got to revive and polish my Evelyn Wood speedreading!"
1,This book was horrible - no other way to describe it.,This book was horrible - no other way to describe it. Theresa is a self-righteous character out of a dime store romance novel and I was not surprised that her husband cheated on her. Garrett would have cheated too had he lived to marry her.The Notebook was excellent. What happened? I think Sparks should stick to the male viewpoint or stop thinking of women in Victorian terms.
4,WISH I HAD READ THIS BEFORE I SAW THE MOVIE,"DEFINITELY A GOOD LOVE STORY, BUT VERY SAD...THE END LETTER IN THE BOOK WAS BETTER THAN THE MOVIE LETTER. I AM NOW READING THE NOTEBOOK."
5,A DEFINITE EYE WETTER!!!,I am 13 years old and I absolutely loved this book! It only took me one day to read it. I couldn't even put it down to do my school work! I don't think i will ever read better!! This book was very moving. The ending was rather suprising and sad. I've never cryed that much just from reading a book!!!
1,reading this book is a monumental waste of time,"I've read love stories before that were sad, interesting and believable. This love story is not one of them. It is basically a cliche-ridden excuse of a book, full of predictable sappy moments and conversations. Most of the ""circumstances"" leading up to when the lovers meet are improbable and trite. Don't waste your time."
1,"Definitely not ""The Notebook""","As someone who loved Spark's novel ""The Notebook"", I was extremely disappointed with this effort. I've seen better character development in high school English papers. Makes me think his previous novel was a fluke."
4,The Book is Better Than the Movie!,"do not judge the book by the horrrible movie! I absolutely loved th book. It is so interesting, you cant put it down! Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful writer ans I reccomend all of his books! This story is sad but so romantic. The ending is different in the book than in the movie, so read it to find out what actually happens!"
4,good...but not Sparks' best,"I liked this book a lot and found it to be very enjoyable. However, it was very predictable but mostly because of all the quotes on the book from magazines that say things like ""unexpected turn"" so obviously now i'm gonna expect a turn. I mean, I just knew exactly what was going to happen, but I found it to be a very enjoyable read. I could see a lot of who Sparks is by his writing, and I think that's pretty cool."
1,Hard to Get Through....,"I loved Spark's first book and when I read the cover of Message I felt that this would easily live up. The plot was laid out well - but early on I got concerned when a dialog between Theresa and Deanna was over cards and every card move was brought into their conversation - like the book itself too much unnecessary information was brought into the plot and it was distracting to read. I think it is fair to say that the concept was okay, but the plot really wandered too far off track to the point where I eventually couldn't even finish the book. Good idea but not worth the read."
2,For Sappy Romance Lovers.,"This is the kind of book that you will read to the end if you are truly dedicated, or you could do what I did, skim over paragraphs at a time, just to see how this dreadful novel ends. The plot itself was quite interesting and should be attributed to the novel's success. In the hands of another writer I imagine that this could have been quite good, however under Nicholas Sparks pen, it comes out as ***** pulp fiction. The tedious, mundane dialogue and uninteresting descriptions are part of the problem, coupled with sheer sappiness.I would recommend this book only to Harlequin Romance lovers and to someone who is recovering from surgery and is taking pain killers, to them the novel could prove to be readable."
1,Poorly written and insulting to the reader.,"Nicolas Sparks has made an assumption about his readers: They're starved for romance. Their lives are empty. They don't know good prose when they see it. Three good ingredients to money-making formulaic writing.How insulting. Here's an example: Sparks writes about our lonely heroin's search for the messages' author. He goes into great lengths about how she logs in, keys in the right command to bring up a search engine, types in the place where her man might be, and, here's the best, we get to see an illustration of what comes on screen! All available choices. Don't it make you want to log in and see what that internet is all about?"
1,Why is THIS a bestseller?,"C'mon Ladies! This book is so hilarious, I can't believe that we are spending our hard-earned dollars on this! I admire Mr. Sparks' attempts at romance, but it is the most predictable corny book with the worst dialogue I think I've read since Muffy and Bif walked Spot to the park. Nick Sparks has the good fortune to be Warner Books Hollywoodized author of the year, but he's no literary wonder. Try Wally Lamb if you want a hanky-worthy book."
5,"More like ""5 hankies""","This book truly tore at my soul. As in The Notebook, Sparks has once again allowed us into the very depths of a romantic relationship...the characters are believable, the circumstances of their coming together definitely unique, yet no fairy tales here. The characters face the challenges of every day people, and you find yourself asking (at least I did) what would I do if I were in Theresa's shoes? Sparks shares with us the beauty of this one-in-a-million relationship and the trials it must face. The love between Garrett and Theresa is one which will live on in the hearts of the readers long after the last page is read."
1,struggling writer from Idaho,"This was a terrible book. The dialogue was cliched, the characters uninteresting and trite. It was so obvious Sparks was trying to appeal to a mostly female audience. The only good thing was the plot premise, but then it turned into predictable mush, even worse than a Mary Higgins Clark novel. The only thing that kept me reading is I wanted to see if it sucked all the way to the end, and it surely did. It is depressing that so many folks here thought this was such a great book -- either they don't read very often or I've overestimated the intelligence of the average reader. How this ever got published, or even made it past the first cut is amazing. Total fluff.This is what it takes to be successful today in America? It's the equivalent of some so-called rap artist becoming a millioniare that can't even sing or play an instrument. Sad."
1,The worst book I ever read!,"The writer has no talent! The only fascinating part of the book is the plot, which became the skeleton of a movie with same title. The descriptions of the sceneries are inaccurate and tastless. The characters are not well-developed. After I finally finished the book, I felt like the author wrote this book in a kind of rush as if he was participating in a speed-writing contest, and quanlity of the work doesn't matter! 370 pages of trash!"
4,My Message.,Message in a Bottle has captured my heart and leaves us feeling that true romance still exsists. I Reccommend this title because it is a great easy read and the character involvment leaves you with a sense of actually being there (most important) even for the toughest of romance critics. Nicholas Sparks has certainly done a great Job in writing this novel. Well Done.
3,This book didn't need to be so depressing.,"This book let me down, but I shouldn't have been surprised. The Notebook treated me the same way. Sparks beautifully draws characters the reader can care about, but he tricks us, ripping them away from us, leaving us feeling unfulfilled. This book's very premise was tragic, but the ending, where a main character dies, is jolting. There is no warning, and that's unfair."
1,This book is so cheesy you need to read it with crackers,"I have never read The Notebook, but I expected much more from Message in a Bottle based upon all that I've heard about Nicholas Evans. A huge dissapointment; I do not recommend this book to anyone other than Danielle Steel fans."
2,Message in a bottle? Sleepless in Boston,"What really strikes me about 'Message in a bottle' is that the story is the same as 'Sleepless in Seattle' except for the fact that Tom Hanks survives. Meg Ryan's editor boss, the radio show in stead of the bottle, the dead wife, the research into his whereabouts, the distance, the flying up and down, the first meeting between the two at the roadside, the son as a motivator to get a girlfriend is replaced by the father, they even both live very close to the water. Give me a break, I am not going to see the movie, I have already seen it!"
2,"Boring, trite dialogues ruin the book.","Try again next time, Sparks. You say men write better in emotional scenes, so maybe you could try learning from them. SNAG huh? Yeah right! *snort*Memo to Sparks : Brush up on the realistic dialogues, and stop trying too hard to be emotional - you end up being too melodramatic and overwrought."
2,Seaside Atmosphere,"This was a good story. A woman finds a message in a bottle. . . And she acts upon it. I won't say anymore about it because I don't want to ruin it for those who have not read it.My favorite thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable, and the food sounded good.This book would probably be considered a romance."
1,The literary equivalent of a 2X4 to the skull.....,"this alleged ""novel"" (I use the word lightly in the case of this endless stream of cliches, hollow banalities, and predictable ""twists"") has no redeeming qualities whatsoever outside of convincing me that the American public have lost their ability to distinguish writing from chicken scratch. Why would women like this book so much? Are they that lonely? Would they really enjoy meeting a man so unable to get over himself? This book is an ode to narcissism if anything, and it will drive cynics even harder to rip to shreds any and all attempts at romance fiction in the future."
1,Most terrible book ever written!,"Nicholas Sparks needs to take a beginner's writing class. The plot is cliched (man falling for woman, man dies and leaves romantic tragedy behind), the characters one-dimensional, and his prose is riddled with hackneyed phrases, empty description, and boring dialogue. How this book ever became a bestseller is shocking to me. I was left literally gagging at the end and believe this will be the first time a movie surpasses a book in meaning and beauty for me. At least with a movie you have beautiful scenery to watch."
1,WHY?,This book was AWFUL! I just don't understand why so many people loved this book. I just don't get it.. not worth the time.
1,I can't believe I wasted my time,This book's dialog made me laugh out loud. I can't believe I spent money on this silly book. The plot is so implausible--I'm a romantic and I didn't even buy this nonsense. I don't think I could recommend this to anyone and call them a friend.
2,Lacks bite,"The beginning of this book is good, and the last 20 pages are very good, but what is between the two lacks depth (severely). The dialogue is trite. It will probably be a hit as a movie (But they had better change the ending !)"
1,Cliche and repetitious.,"I feel cheated -- I get so little time to read anything other than technical manauls and I spent my precious time reading Message in a Bottle. I cannot figure out what everybody is raving about. I found this book to be predictable, boring, and a real disappointment."
3,"Eh, mediocre but somewhat enjoyable.","I only read this book because my girlfriend loved it and wanted me to. It started off okay and kept my interest but as the story dragged on, I was yearning for the end. I was getting impatient with the characters, at their inability to make a decision about the relationship. I couldn't stop turning the pages because I wanted to finish it and get on to my next book. I'll still take my girl to see the movie though and won't gripe or snore just so she can enjoy it :)"
5,Message in the Bottle,I decided to read Message in the Bottle after reading most of Nicholas Sparks' novels. I still have a few of his other ones to complete his collection..I can't believe it took me this long to read Message in the Bottle..I enjoyed the book from beginning to end. Definitely a tearjerker..
1,Teresa destroyed garrett by playing with his affections,Teresa was not honest with Garrett. She played on his emotions and should have been upfront with him much sooner. The ending was predictable but very emotional. Why did Garrett have to die. It's the story of loss and longing.
5,The romance novel of a life time!,"This book definetely had you quickly turning the pages waiting in supspense as to what the next message in a bottle says. You become captivated and taken in by the emense love and dedication Garret portrays for his late wife, Catherine. It's then Theresa's determination to find out who the ""man in behind these mysterious love letters"" is. This book has you smiling yet crying at the same time as this romantic love story unfolds. I've never been so effected by a story like this before in hope that there really is such thing as love."
3,"A far cry from Shakespeare, but a fun read anyway!","I enjoyed this book in spite of the fact that the quality of the writing was almost embarrassing at times. I give the author credit for creating unique and interesting story lines ( I felt the same way about The Notebook), but he definitely needs a better editor! I thought, however, that there were moments of very good writing. Essentially, it was an easy, enjoyable book with a worthwhile message about living our lives in the present. Not all writing has to be Shakespeare to be worth our time."
3,Romantic yet flawed,"Message in a Bottle was a great romantic diversion after reading some not-so-light reading. However, even though I am a romantic at heart & look so forward to reading this, I found the character of Theresa flawed and a bit of the storyline flawed. Why wasn't Theresa plagued with some guilt at the end? Why was the description of the Happenstance at the end touched upon a little more. Why did the events at the end of the book happen so quickly, like a flash before my eyes? It seems as if Mr. Sparks needed to end his book quickly, and I found it quite a disappointment!"
1,Stupid stupid stupid,"This was one of the stupidest, most predictable books I've ever read! I hated it. Actually, I don't even know why I wasted the time reading it!"
2,Not his best.....,"Did not enjoy reading this book. I think it was a disappointment after reading ""The Notebook"". I would highly recommend reading The Notebook instead of this book. The Notebook is actually one of my all time favorite books. Maybe if I would have read the message in a bottle before the notebook, I would have enjoyed it more. After reading the first book (The Notebook) - I guess I just had higher expectations of the next book."
1,The Message in the Bottle is no Notebook.,"After reading the Notebook, Sparks, a new author seemed to have captured the story of undying love. I had found myself amazed that a man who wrote fiction could grasp the underpinnings of unconditional love and move the reader to tears. However, this book paled in comparison. The characters were poorly developed and the plot seemed far fetched. The book droned on about the lead character's son Kevin, yet failed to develop a reason for even mentioning the son. Additionally, the relationship between Theresa and Garret did not appear to emmulate ""love"". I read that the Notebook, although fiction, had some basis in reality as it described Spark's grandparents relationship. However, Message in the Bottle left me with no message at all."
5,grazie Nicholas per aver riportato serenità nel mio cuore...,"Angelo dagli occi verdi, Penso a te e mi accrgo di morire una volta ancora di quella cosa che si chiama vita, sono sincero come non lo sono mai stato, ti amerò per sempre. Senza spiegazioni. Senza un motivo."
3,ON THE LOOSE,"SAGA was extremely efficient in brilliant instrumental interludes, driving non-stop rhythms and big blustery electronic rock. This collection spans 15 years of their prolific if not superstar career.I like SAGA, especially their biggest US hits, ON THE LOOSE and WIND HIM UP. They amassed lots of albums, mostly successful overseas. Lead vocalist Michael Sadler has also had some success in his solo career.The main drawback of this talented band, at least on this 15 track compilation, is by the 7th or 8th song, you realize they start to sound alike. Granted, they're flawlessly performed, but I would like more variety in their repertoire.Probably better to enjoy in stages, 5 or 6 tracks at a time. Still a good choice for adventurous 80s fans."
2,Lost his luster...,"I really liked Australia so I was pretty eager for the release of ""Stop all the World Now"". Unfortunately, this is an overproduced, un-inspired, piece of bubble gum pop garbage. Howie's voice has lost it's edge...the production is glossed up to perfection... the songs are easy and lack the emotion that was present in Australia. These are the perfect elements to please the masses of drones who buy anything that Mtv tells them to...but for those of us that buy music because it's good and heartfelt, well this album is simply a waste of time.Australia was emotional, flawed, and amazing... This album is a complete bore."
2,Disappointing Day,"As someone who was completely in love with ""Australia"" I found this new cd a HUGE disappointment. I loved the authentic sound and emotion of the first cd and this one lacks it severely. It covers his great voice with an obnoxious band and his creative and interesting lyrics are replaced by the mainstream sound of other artists. If you loved the old Howie Day this cd is a big disappointment."
3,Good Sophmore Effort,"Three stars out of five rating for this album. Why? Because it is very middle of the road. Howie Day didnt take a lot of chances when he wrote this album. Yes, the songs are well arranged and polished, but many of them lack the uniqueness and personality that the previous album had. I want Howie Day to write the kind of raw, emotional songs that we fell in favor with in Australia. A few songs on the album are worth a listen, but the others fall short."
5,PARALYZED,wow .... thats all i can say! this is the first sixpence cd i have bought and i can say its awesome and well worth the money..... its so breezy and so comfortable .. good for any mood... its just the perfect cd.stick out songs:breathe your nametonightdown and out of timedon't dream....still burningwaiting ont he sunparalyzeda million parachutes
2,Get Madden 2003,NFL 2K3 is a good game but Madden is sooo much better. Some things that Madden has that NFL 2k3 doesnt is mini-camp (which is awesome)and the option of challenging a play. Madden's graphics are better too. The control of Madden is alot better. Another problem with NFL 2k3 is that the defense is interception/fumble crazy. There are way to many fumbles and interceptions. Madden has more plays to pick and more audible choices. So if your playing on buying 2k3 forget about and get Madden.
5,All things Porcupine Tree are EXCEPTIONAL,". . . and this is no exception.This is one of Porcupine Tree's several masterpieces! Fantastic, moving long songs, great eery, mystical lyrics and sound, just the most perfect harmonies, and you've got The Sky Moves Sideways.P>Get this cd, and then pick up Stupid Dream, Lightbulb Sun, Signify, and Up The Downstairs. You will be forever grateful that when such purchases pay you back 1000-fold in pure joy!"
3,Decent BUT OVERPRICED import!,"This 5 track CD is a nice addition to any Sade collection.The main problem that I have is the number of tracks! Only 5 songs! This doesn't represent anything 'deluxe' to me because Sade has so many great songs.The bright spot among the so-so remixes is the rare track 'Make Some Room', which is mainly a tight instrumental with Sade ocassionally adding a few vocals! My suggestion is to get someone to burn a CD copy for you, or visit an auction site like Ebay to bid on an affordable copy!"
4,Sade Remix,"Even though this release is a little light on the number of tracks, a true Sade fan will still appreciate it. Honestly, I only purchased this disc for ""Make some room"" which I previously owned as a B-side on the ""Nothing can come between us"" 45 - which was in need of a major update.The other remixes are dated, but pretty good - just seen as a bonus in my point of view.Purchased through the Amazon Market Place for nowhere near $28."
3,Another one of Bush's incomptents,"Bremer's year in Iraq was the turning point in the Iraq war...a war that was not considered in is consequences by Bush or his cronyies, bomb first, think later if at all! It was a year when both security and economic issues were in desperate need of the best minds possible...instead we got Bremer. It is not that the endless problems that came up were entirely Bremer's fault, except in part..the war architects had not even minimally anticipated what would happen, thus they destroyed central leadership [....], then through bombing destroy resource basis, then through disbanding security forces (Bremer) unleashed competitive violence and underlyng ethnic conflict.amazing thatthey did not see it coming...incompetent and America and the Iraqis pay and pay and pay........."
3,An Apologia,"""How I Established a Peaceful, Democratic Iraq and Won the Presidential Medal of Freedom,"" by L. Paul Bremer III.For serious students of the Iraq war, this is a must-read... a primary source by one who played a key role in the occupation. Get Bremer's view first-hand and compare it to how others have portrayed his decisions and his role in the conflict.For those who may not have the time or expertise to weigh this book's version of history versus others, I recommend books generally considered more comprehensive and balanced, such as ""Assassin's Gate"" by George Packer, ""State of Denial"" by Bob Woodward, or ""Fiasco"" by Thomas Ricks."
3,She needs a much better production!,"Although listening to something Cyndi does is always a pleasure, her music here needs a much better production! Everything sounds a bit [low quality], dull and outdated. I hope that the upcoming full-length album will have a more cutting edge sound. ""Sisters of Avalon""'s music was more refined and its sheer production truly SHINED."
5,actually I would give it ten stars!!,"this ep rocks!! I LOVE Madonna Whore, and the title track is one of my fave Lauper tunes !! [....]"
1,Purgatory,"The music is not bad, but the lyrics are just awful -- simplistic writing, forced rhymes, and atrocious meter. There's not much actual singing here, it's more like reading to music. This would be fine if it sounded like the music were written to fit the words, but I think the result would have been equal or better if she had pulled a random book off a shelf and read it to the music. The London sessions are better, since the instrument tracks are engineered to mask most of the flaws in the vocal track. Even so, the replay value is minimal -- there are only a couple songs that I would want to hear again. I was intrigued by the idea of having the two different versions; sadly, the material does not warrant it. On the positive side, at least it was a single-album price."
1,A long time fan,and I'm sad I have to write this. I have everything she's recorded that I can get my hands on and have seen her in concert a few times. She is close to being my all time favorite singer. I was so looking forward to this CD. Though I love everthing else she has done I was hoping so hard for another Gospel Oak or Universal Mother.I had it on my Ipod five minutes after I opened it. I'm such a fan I actually buy the CD to have the liner notes and pictures instead of downloading. From the very start what a disappointment. I even waited to write a review hoping it would grow on me. It didn't.It truly sounds like a High School garage band. Amateurish is not even the word to describe it. Its just bad. So bad I actually removed it from my Ipod.I'm still a fan and will support her in the future and I'm hoping this is a one time horror.
5,Different but Lovely,"I ordered this for my husband, who is a long time Sinead fan. I was a little nervous, since the reviews were not glowing, but he and I have both been glad I bought it. It is true, that it is very different from some of her other work, but that is what we love about Sinead as an artist. She never bores us and we love to go on her journey through life with her, through her music. I'm glad she does what is in her soul and doesn't bow to popular opinion. In my book, that makes her more of an ""artist"" and less of an ""entertainer"" although she is both. What a great antidote for all the mindless, bubble-gum music we get bombarded with most days!"
1,Total let-down,"If you are looking for these two specials as they aired on TV, do NOT waste your money on this DVD set. These are NOT the specials that aired at ALL, but more of a ""David looks back"" type of thing. The ""Drowned Alive"" special is what really got me into freediving, and introduced me to Kirk Krack, Mandy-Rae Cruickshank, and Martin Stepanek, and led me to be trained by the three of them three months later in Miami. On this DVD, they are all but TOTALLY cut out, and not even worth a MENTION. Definitely NOT what I was looking forward to in this release. EXTREMELY disappointed."
4,Light and good.,"I like this book alot, and it looks great on my coffee table. A lot of the quotes are repeated throughout, though. Nonetheless, it always gets picked up and browsed through when I have company over. I've found several quotes to copy and post in various places around the house. Was worth the money. Glad I have it."
5,The best CD dictionary available,"The Dictionary in the CDs is by far the best I have ever seen, absolutely fascinating.The phrase bank and the activator are invaluable, the examples bank very useful and the web email/pop up very interesting. No doubt it is an excellent purchase. I installed the CDs on both windows 2000 and XP without problems. Choose full installation for ultimate performance."
3,Not worth the price. Space bar requires hard pressing,"Overall it's a nice looking keyboard. However, the space bar is not very responsive and unless I press hard it doesn't work. This is the second Logitech Edge I have hadthis (oops) problem with.The general build quality is also decent. But with my experience (and many others) with the space bar I would not buy or recommend this keyboard. It is simply not worth the price."
5,Logitech diNovo Edge Keyboard (Black),I love this Keyboard and Mouse combined. It looks cool the way you see it in pictures...keys and mouse works good. It's very ease to install. very good battery life because it uses Bluetooth technology and you do not have to point your keyboard to USB plugged... you could be sitting in any direction and still can use it...I think this is the best keyboard I have ever bought...I still have my old wireless keyboard sitting in corner. Now I use computer more because I want to use this this Keyboard...
2,Laptop-like keyboard without laptop-like Numpad functions,"While this keyboard has sleek-looking hotness, it really isn't that good of a keyboard for home or office use. I find the Gyration keyboards to be much more functional, and the keyboard isn't as comfortable to use as my Thinkpad X-series keypad (and it's smaller).Cons:ExpensiveLack of functionalityControls don't work as expectedAlmost impossible to use when charging the batteryNot as comfortable as many other laptop keyboardsDid I mention it was expensive?Pros:Looks really nice on the desktopKeyboard will work before windows boots."
5,Works as advertised,"Bought this product for a customer to use in a goofy situation where it wasn't ideal for a normal mouse to be used. The end users are not tech folks whatsoever and all were able to use the keyboard without much of a learning curve. Of course there is no numeric key pad on the side like stanard keyboard, but who cares, type writers didn't have them either. It's not an issue if you learn how to type.I would buy this product for myself and for anyone else who I felt it could work for due to simplicity."
4,This keyboard rocks!,"A little costly, but found it to be cheapest on amazon.com. Got the super saver shipping and it was here in two days. Love the extra functions and scrolling mouse touch pad. Awesome product."
4,Better construction,"the diNovo keyboard is better made than any other keyboard I've used over the years. I bought it because I was tired of sticking keys and flimsy-feeling key action in other (including other Logitech) keyboards. The key action on the diNovo is a dream. The touch sensitive volume control is also nice, and easy to use. I haven't used the touchpad much, but it also seems to work well. My only criticisms are that there is no number pad, and the glossy black finish, while beautiful, shows fingerprints after every use. I have cut a small strip of clear screen protector material to put in the area most prone to thumb prints, below the space bar, and that helps. Otherwise, keep the cleaning cloth that is supplied handy. Overall, this is a great keyboard."
3,Signal just comes and goes,I have been using this keyboard for about a month and it works great most of the time.But sometimes it will be the pointer or the keyboard will just stop working. I'll give it 30 40 seconds and it starts working again.I'm only about 15 feet from the computer on my couch.I just can't figure it out. It's like the Bluetooth just stopsfor a few seconds or something. It's just not 100% all the time andfor the money it should be.
1,Poor Battery Life and Range,I had purchased this keyboard before and spilled coffee on it. The price came down significantly this summer so I decided to get another one. This time the battery wouldn't last more than a day with light usage. I used to charge it weekly. I also have to sit within a couple feet of the USB antenna. Previously I was able to sit on the other side of the room with no trouble. It looks like they are cleaning out the junk in their factory before the next model comes out.
5,This keyboard rocks,"This keyboard is perfect for my entertainment center, no need for a mouse/keyboard combo, range is very good, holds a charge for long periods of time (I have yet to run the battery down)and it is very cool."
5,Outstanding product!,"Looks and functions great - the only thing I didn't like is the orange back on the keyboard. The keyboard looks like an art piece from the front and the orange back just totally ruined it. Also, don't be fooled into thinking this is a fragile keyboard by how thin it looks. If you search for a video on youtube, you'll find somebody testing the durability of this unit by throwing it down a hill multiple times and it still worked fine. (I don't know why somebody would do that to an expensive keyboard, but hey, it proves a point)"
2,"Great keyboard, however....","I loved using this keyboard. It was my home theater/server wireless keyboard. It's comfortable to use and works well. Unfortunately, as I recently discovered, if you lose or damage the charging base your keyboard becomes worthless. This is because Logitech does not sell a replacement base, only a replacement AC adapter. This is completely unacceptable for such an expensive, high-end keyboard. I won't be purchasing another after my now-useless Edge loses its final charge."
4,Worth the money - Wish it had numpad,"The quality of this keyboard is the best I have ever used. The form factor, key comfort, finish...everything is very nice. I am slowly making the adjustment but am having a challenge without the numbers pad. The touch mouse is just so/so but everything else is amazingly good."
2,Good Keyboard/Broke in 4 months,"I was looking for something for my HTPC that could be recognized during boot and include mouse and keyboard in one unit. In four months I charged it only two times. Unfortunately, the up arrow AND the right arrow keys stopped working on me. I plugged the device into another computer to check if it was indeed a hardware issue for such a new device. Indeed, this was the case. In addition to receiving a faulty product, Logitech customer service was poor and would not honor their warranty.I will instead purchase a Apple magic trackpad and Apple wireless keyboard for my HTPC. If I have to boot to bios then I will use my 8 dollar wireless mouse and keyboard, which has working up and right arrow keys : )I will not purchase from Logitech again due to their poor customer service.Note: If the product was not defective I would have rated it 4 stars. -1 star for the track disc/mouse being uncomfortable to use."
4,Great Key Response,"The DiNovo Edge is extremely similar to typing on a laptop keyboard (with great key response). It is very quiet and thin, tucking neatly out of the way in its charging base when necessary. My only inor complaint is its lck of native drivers for 64-bit vista. I have not tried overly-hard, but the assignable keys do not work on my keyboard."
4,Almost Perfect,"Like with most Logitech high end products, this one could really be the best of the best, but it has some flaws which you can overcome at additional cost.The hardware construction is extremely good, with one small issue of Plexiglass detached in some places, but it is really a minor issue.The real problem here is a connection with the class-2 Bluetooth adapter with range up to 10 meters.If you intend to use the keyboard at a distance of 1 meter, than it will work very well. But for most of us who want to use it from a distance 2-5 meters, it will constantly stop responding and/or disconnect.You can fix this, if you are ready to spend another $30 on a class-1 Bluetooth adapter. I have tried Cirago (with toshiba driver) but it didn't work very well.The one I have found to work the best is Anycom USB-550 (with broadcom chipset, which is the one originally used in Logitech adapter). Just remember to download the latest driver from their forum: BTW_5.5.0.7400."
3,Great when it works,"So I've had 4 of these keyboards now..On the first one.. the left and right mouse buttons creaked and were sticky when they were clicked..On the second one, it wouldn't charge properly (Flashed one green light, then 3 red repeatedly)On the third and fourth, the touchdiscs didn't work. Neither of them lit up or responded without putting extreme amounts of pressure on the pad. And by extreme, I'd guess at least 50 pounds of pressure.That said, I've exchanged each one out and I'm still searching for a fifth one beacuse the keyboard itself is just that good when it works. It's by far the best one I've ever owned in just about every possible way. Just wish quality control was a little better."
3,DiNovo Edge of Insanity more like,"I'm writing this review while my PC wakes itself up from by me mistakenly pressing the sleep button for the umpteenth time on this infuriating device. I feel like throwing it out the window. It *could* have been a great product, if they'd tested the usability properly. Aside from the sleep button being in the top left where you frequently grab hold of it, using the circular trackpad is an exercise in frustration. Why can't you disable the double tap on the trackpad? You end up dragging and dropping folders by accident, and you have no idea which folder you moved and where it now is! God, this is a frustrating keyboard."
1,It's lemon.,"With all the good look, the mouse pad failed in one week. Overall while it is working, it doesn't feel as good as my Viao key board. So I sent it back."
3,It's Ok but Nothing To Write Home About,"I own a Logitech Wave wireless keyboard and love it. I wanted a keyboard with a built in mouse, so decide to try the Edge. The keyboard gets the job done, but is not as comfortable as the Wave. After 11 months, the keyboard stopped pairing with my computer, so I called tech support and ended up mailing it in for a replacement. I got the replacement in about 2 weeks; I have no complaints with customer service. The real complaint I have with the keyboard is that you have to take your hands off the keyboard to control the mouse; the mouse pad is on the far right. It would have been better, if it were in the center like a laptop then you wouldn't have to take you hand off the keyboard when using the mouse."
5,Excellent keyboard,"Perfect key stroke feel. Excellent quality, materials and appearance. Makes computer work much more enjoyable."
3,B-movie,"funny in parts ,drags in other parts,best part is Joan Blondell in bath tub! just average WB B-movie.If you like B-movies is ok to watch not on par with other Cagney,Blondell movies"
1,Looks like Cagney turns out to be Rumpole,"I purchased this new from media_distributors but I made the mistake of not looking at it right away. It looked like it was new and the video was labeled Blonde Crazy. It came in a Blonde Crazy Box wrapped in cellophane. When I popped it into the video machine I had to rewind it. When I played it, it turned out to be Rumpole.Update. I wrote an email to Media Distributors after posting this, and they replaced my video. Outstanding."
5,THE GOTHIC DUDES ONCE AGAIN,IT'S A FACT NOW. IRON MAIDEN ARE THE ONLY BAND IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW WHO CAN PLAY MANY CHORDS WITH THEIR POWERFUL LYRICS TO MAKE U CRAZY. THE TIME I GOT THE ALBUM I LISTENED TO IT 5 TIMES IN A SINGLE DAY ITSELF.SUCH IS THE PACE OF THESE DUDES WHO TRULY DO THINGS WITH THEIR HEART AND SOUL. NONE OTHER THAN MAIDEN HAS NE BAND COME CLOSER. TOM MORELLO FROM AUDIOSLAVE CAN PLAY ONLY A FRACTION OF WHAT THESE PEEEPS CAN. SO GO AHEAD BUY THIS CLASSIC MASTERPIECE. BRUCE DICKINSON'S VOICE MAY SOUND OLD BUT IT REALLY STANDS TO BE A MIND BOGGLING ALBUM IN THE 21TH CENTURY. I HOPE THEY MAKE MORE STUFF LIKE THIS FOREVER !!!!!!!!!!!
2,not very good,"this is not as good as brave new world. it is very repetitive. too many songs sound like the ones from last album. don't get me wrong, there are a couple of good songs, but not nearly enough to call it a success."
2,dance of mediocrity,"Yes, i am a huge maiden fan and always will be, but i am also honest.this album is nowhere near as good as ""brave new world.""it does have a few good moments, like all maiden albums(they don't write a bad album), but the album is mostly filler.the first 4 songs could all be combined into one, because the riffs and time signatures are all the same.on the title track, the music is quite good, but the strings are so loud in the mix, it sounds more like jethro tull then maiden.lastly, bruce needs to rest his voice a bit more, because this album shows a very weary voice.I'm sure the tour will be quite fun, and the live songs are always better than the album versions, but this album should not have been rushed to print.maiden should really take more time recording. it shows in the lyrics and in the music. this is a 2 star maiden album, but hey! they had a great 25 years didn't they?"
2,We have heard it all before,It's the most boring maiden CD with bruce on vovals. The Best song is the last one: Journeyman. Rainmaker is ok and so is Paschendale. The rest is the same slow intros we have heard before and very repeating.
4,Pretty good metal,"At first this album struck me as just alright for Maiden, with the typical harmonies and guitar solos, but the more I listened the more I liked. A few songs are somewhat drawn out and almost repetitive, but the title track is simply amazing taking a very progressive sound to almost make you think you were listening to Strativarius or the great Dream Theater. Overall its a solid metal album, which in this day and age is getting hard to find."
4,Maiden is still alive!!!!,"Highly recommended. DoD is a great follow up for BNW. If you didn't like BNW (or you don't like TRUE Metal) you will probably just consider this an average CD, but if you like Metal, listen to it and you will see it is a good step in Maiden's evolution. Up the Irons!!!I also recommend:* Iron Maiden's Brave New World & Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* Therion's Vovin & Secret of The Runes (One of the best CDs I have ever heard!!!)* Blind Guardian's Nightfall in Middle-Earth, Tales From the Twilight World & Imaginations From the Other Side* Iced Earth's Horror Show"
3,"A sloppy sequal to ""a brave new world""","It's just that, basically it has the same sound in every way to Maidens last studio album, but, it seems to be alot more sloppy in the vocals. And, to top things off, instrumentally it basically copies there last album to the last note!"
4,Back from the Grave!,"I was very pleased to get the latest CD by Iron Maiden. It is great to see the old crew from Piece of Mind and Powerslave back, and Janick Gers (added for Fear of the Dark) is still on-board giving Iron Maiden 3 axe-men. All of the songs harken back to 80s and early 90s hard rock and the narrative-style lyrics sung by the incomporable Bruce Dickinson coupled with the flowing guitar melodies from Smith, Murray, and Gers make for some very memorable songs. Listen to Rainmaker, Montsegur, Paschendale. These are great songs! A Maiden fan starving for nostalgia will not be disappointed."
3,Bring Back The Great ROCK,"Iron Madien was great! Don't understand whats happened to the Rock/Metal band these days.They want to get back in the mix but the youth of this day and age are mindless and don't understand the true sound of hard rock music.Iron Madien,Fight/Judas Priest(Rob Halford),Metallica and other 80s/90s Rock bands are trying to get back in the groove but have to stoop to the level of this s**t that they call Rock these days.Its SUCKS,it needs to be called something else.Non-play kids playing crap that sounds like they are just learning how to play.The masters of the Rock/Metal need to produce the sound that made them great.Blow these punks off the stage.The hard Rock needs to come back teach the next generation how to do it.They have it ,they just need to bring it.Then maybe I can start truning my radio back on Thats all I have to say about that"
2,Worse Than Life And Death,"I was really bored with the Life and Death disc as it only had 2 interesting songs. On this one I only enjoyed 1 track. Instant buy & resell disc. I can't take Maiden any more. It's clear they just don't have a good work ethic. They've gotten too lazy, or brain-damaged to know you can't play the same freakin' power chords for 100 years without someone telling the truth."
3,A good effort. But what is the contribution?,"Good album, but not new ideas. DOD is far to be the best realization of iron maiden. Only four songs have the maiden standar: ""Montsegur"", ""Paschendale"", ""Face in the sand"" and ""Age of innocence"". The others are a replication of the ideas in BNW, XF and VXI. Four songs between eleven?. Is a poor contribution.I am fan of maiden for twenty years, but when I listened NPFD, I thought ""The sands of time will run more speed than they want it""."
3,decent cd for a true maiden fan,"All I can really say about this is well unless you are a true Iron Maiden fan I sudgest you don't bother wasting your money. Instead go out and get A Brave New World, or One of their older cd's like Number of the Beast, or even Killers. I just don't think that any person who likes Iron Maiden as a day to day fan should spend their money on a half decent Cd."
4,Better than you may think!!,"I understand that this is not classic Iron Maiden, and I am seeing that Bruces voice isnt exactly the same. The cover art does suck. How ever this is still a very solid album, you have to look at the instrumental skill. With three guitarists the solo's are twice as good as they were in the beginning. The riffs however arent the same as they used to be and dont carry that signature Maiden sound, that so many bands seem to be repeating in their music lately. This isnt classic Iron Maiden but it is still great, buy this if you're a guitarist or just a Maiden fan."
5,AWSOME,Maiden is back and they are more hardcore then ever.*WARNING* This album is not for cry babies this is only for the hardest of the hardcore fans. I would say this is probably their bes album since seventh son of a seventh son. Janieck Gers solos rip this album and Bruce Dickinson's vocals sound amazing.
5,Gift,Brought it for my father since we have not been able to find it in the store he loves to use this.
2,reissue,same as another voice of Bob Marley Japanese Importstudio rehearsals interesting but for the serious Marley collector
4,S.T.Dupont,It is very nice. I ordered it and got it in very short time. I use Dupont for more than 5 years. Its smell is perfect.
1,Boos Block,"This product did not hold up, I ordered it in Feb. and it has already come unglued. I never put it in the dishwasher and only washed it by hand.John Boos 12-Inch Square Maple Cutting Board with Feet"
5,love em !!,I bought this one for my mom. This is a hard maple cutting board which is ok for use with all foods. Read up on wood cuting boards and bacteria for your own piece of mind. This thing is heavy duty and looks great sitting on your counter no matter if you are using it or not. I have owned these for years and never ever had an issue with them. I follow the cleaning and care (oil once a month if needed) and its never failed me.
2,"Cheap print--NOT sewn, as advertised","The product description said in two places that ""This flag has sewn stripes and embroidered stars"" and ""Sewn stripes & embroidered stars"" but the flag that was delivered to me was a cheap printed version. I was specifically looking for a sewn flag and this one failed to deliver as advertised."
5,Back to my childhood,"I have vivid memories of reading this charming book. The author was the Children's Librarian of the library I practically lived in as a child in Northport, NY. She was perfect in that job. Knowledgable, enthusiastic and devoted to creating life long readers. She certainly helped me become a passionate reader for life.I can't wait for my granddaughter to be old enough ot understand this story. It will be a ""must read"" at Halloween."
4,Awesome game!,"Although this game has not yet been released, I did play it for a brief while in a gaming store, and I was hooked. I am basically an RPG fan, and although I usually play those games, this game intrigued me right away. The graphics are exceptional, and the storyline is very entertaining, but my one problem with the game was the controls. They were very awkward and made it hard to move the main character. Despite this however, I think that the game is definately worth buying."
4,All that and a bag of chips....wait....except for the camera,"Wow. This game is superb. Its a visual masterpiece, with all the samurai slashing you can think of. A great story line, compliments the awsome gameplay. Unfortunately, there are some flaws. But these flaws are not bad enough to hinder your experience with the game. Camera angles suffer when you take the fight from room to room. It often gets caugh inbetween rooms, which either lets you see your character and not the enemy, or lets you watch the enemy slash your character to pieces. Its not as bad as it seems. This game will be a lot more enjoyable for those who have not played Onimusha: Warlords, since most of the areas are the same. Other than that, this game is a must buy, and must be on a shelf of any action/adventure gamer."
4,Better than the first...,"If you are a fan of the first Onimusha you will no doubt like the sequel. However, instead of improving on the game it just seems like an extension to the first Onimusha. You have a few new weapons but you will find them quite hard to use unless you are fighting an extremely slow foe. The puzzles are much more difficult this time around and some toward the end will have you stuck for hours. Overall, I would recommend playing this game if you loved the first Onimusha."
3,Playing Onimusha 2 is like driving a old used car.,"Onimusha 2 is capcom's attempt to capitalize on Onimusha 1. There is very little differences b/w one and two. In fact the game is easier than before and could be completed in one day. I would strongly discourage buying this game due to following...- Half the game locations in 2 is reused from one.- Very few level bosses (fight same bosses 3 times)- Game is too easy...if you've played the original Onimusha one.- Very few CG cut scenes.- Not many new monsters. Some monsters are reused from Onimusha one, and many others are slightly modified from the original.- No graphic improvements.- Nothing Innovative. Exchanging gifts with other characters is waste of time.The game is still fun to play but for those anxiously waiting for the sequal would be very dissapointed. Onimusha 2 is a half-... attempt to rush out a sequal inorder to make money. Rent it instead."
2,Dissapointing,"The first Onimusha was a lot of fun but this one is sort of a bust. Half of the playtime is spent retracing the steps of the first game and killing the same monsters. The fighting is just as fun and satisfying, but for some reason, the collection of souls (which if you don't know, levels-up your character) is very tedious--battling these same enemies and recycled bosses quickly becomes boring.There is an attempt to make the game more dynamic by including the exchange of ""gifts"". These are items you buy or find and give to other characters for rewards. These rewards can be more gifts to give away, or health items and weaponry, but in the end, this process seems like a drawn-out way of getting the much needed health-boosts and extra items that are in very short supply throughout the game. You also get a lot of junk.At the very least, this is a nice distraction if you're sitting at home and wanting to veg out, but I suggest that you rent or buy it instead of paying full-price."
5,"compelling video, excellent presentation",This video gives an excellent presentation of the crucifixion from both the scientific and faith perspectives. The believer will come away with a better understanding of both Jesus' divinity and humanity. The agnostic will come away with compelling arguments for the authenticity of the Gospel accounts of the final hours of the historical Jesus. I highly recommend this video.
1,Not Impressed,"Bought this knife looking at the good reviews on Amazon. Generally that works , but not with this product. The quality is sub par and it has rust stains all over within 2 months. Totally dis-satisfied with the purchase, Will not recommend this to anyone"
3,"Great stuff, just wish they'd included more obscure songs.","This collection is worth it, SO many songs, albeit primarily for the amazing covers of ""Rocket Man,"" ""Lay, Lady, Lay"" and the Beatles ""Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End"" medley.There are already so many recordings of Neil singing his standard hits, I really wish they would have included more obscure songs like the ones listed above.I would love to have a copy of Neil doing the ""Jonathan Seagull"" medley as performed at the L.A. Forum, June 1983; as well as ""Primitive"" from San Diego, October, 1983. (The heavy guitar version as performed here was always my favorite of this song. I've never forgotten it.)The DVD was fun...but why couldn't Neil have worn ANY other shirt. Goodness! His 1989 tour clothes were great. I even liked his 1980's glass beaded/fringe shirts. Why oh why must such a talented guy dress like a 62-year-old Jewish woman out for a night on the town? His dress demeans his EXTRA-ordinarily talented musical gifts."
5,A must for all Neil Diamond fans!!,"this Box set shows that neil has not lost anything!! I have been a neil diamond fan since I could turn on aturntable. ( about 12. now am 45 and still love neil diamond) the DVd is great!! I love the concert clips and the behind the scences, in Diamondville. you really get a feeling how the band and the whole krew deals with life on the road. and I dont know about anyone else but as a neil Diamond fan for my whole life I do like to get little bits of things that go on with the band. and he tells us that and shows us with his live concerts and his Dvd so if you love neil diamond this box set is a must..anne"
5,extremely helpful!,"Our son was suffering an extreme case of separation anxiety. It came on suddenly after attending kdg for a few months. We believe that my being ill for a week was the trigger. He became overly worried about my well-being and the well-being of other immediate family members. He wanted us all to be together all the time. I ordered this book in hopes of finding some techniques to talk him through this and to get him over it so that he could return to school without crying. Within a week of using the ideas and conversations in this book, my son was back to ""normal"". Other anxieties are covered in this book as well and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to help their child overcome childhood anxiety. Wonderfully written and a wealth of information!"
5,Freein g Your Child From Anxiety,This is excellent and very detailed and covers all forms of anxiety. Found it very helpful even for myself. Highly recommended.
2,Kindle version has many errors!,"I purchased the Kindle version. The book's content seems excellent so far - I'm about 1/5 of the way in - but there are many distracting errors and omissions in the Kindle version. Sidebar charts have been included as images, which makes reading them very cumbersome. And wherever one of these charts appears, the text that flows around it seems to disappear - sentences are not finished and ideas are fragmented, leaving you to wonder what is missing and to waste time trying to piece together the phrasing to get the gist. With this content, that is very counterproductive. Poorly implemented, clearly the Kindle version was not proofread. I will request a refund."
5,F***ing Brilliant!!!!!!!,"Better than the first edition! No one knows what to think of this book when they pick it up off of my coffee table. They look around and see Dostoevsky, Poe, Neruda, Plath and Elliot and then they notice my penchant for potty mouthed humor and never know what to think. Next to lit they find Sid the Sexist, and both of the Roger's Profanisaurus'. Well, a gal can be smart and talk like a sailor at the same time ya know! So, go take Captain Picard to warp speed if you don't like it."
4,Enjoyable and Intriguing,"Reading this book had me wondering about the mystical properties of numbers, whether there was some elemental truth I could discover. Overall, the book was an enjoyable and illuminating examination of e, and a solid retelling of e's importance in the development of trigonometry."
5,Compelling and easy to read,"I know calculus but I didn't know much about some of the history of mathematics. How easy is to learn a complex theme in the words of this author. A fascinating book about an important number, browsing the history of logarithms, then some of the history of calculus and finally the history of Leonhard Euler, and the first appearance of ""e"". Obviously you find mathematics in this book, but presented in a easy-to-understand way."
3,Complexity grows exponentially,"I took calculus in high school and I took 2 calculus courses in college, but that was nearly 35 years ago. I am reasonably well versed in math for a non-mathematician.The early parts of this book were quite understandable. About half way through the lifting got heavier, but manageable. The final 30 or 40 pages were close to incomprehensible to me.The first 2/3 to 3/4 was worthwhile, but I did not get a lot out of the last part of this book. I am not panning this book, but it takes more of a mathematics background to fully understand what this book has to offer than Mr. Maor suggests."
5,"joy to read, crystal clear explanations","The book is a gem in that it explains the somewhat difficult concepts of differential equations, logarithms and differentiation in very crisp, very easy to understand manner, but the best part is that it shows different angles and perspective of the same concepts. If you didn't get something in first several chapters you'll understand it in the next.It takes a great teacher to write a book on essential calculus that is so easy to read. I am looking forward to reading other titles by Eli."
4,e!,Having just finished a series of first year college calculus lectures I found this book to be both interesting and potentially useful.I highly recommend this book to anyone either having taken a first year calculus course or who is in such a course.I read the Kindle version but found it easier to read on my Samsung tablet.
2,Disappointing,"I rented this game and it's a disappointment. I really don't see why this game got rave reviews. The gameplay and the graphics are horrible. For instance, how they make you use the analog stick when you pick your offensive and defensive plays...if you push the analog stick up or down and let go, the cursor will come back to its original location. Another problem is when you try to move your defensive line guys to the left or right, he will move towards the line of scrimmage which may cause you to touch the offensive linemen. The player movement is very unnatural. There are so many problems that I can't even get to all of them. This is far from a bias opinion but Madden is better."
1,eh,"if you want to read about jesus, pick up your bible. not this book.this book is but a cluttered mess."
1,"Doesn't work, haven't been able to get anyone to help","Got this as a Christmas present but when my kids opened it, the electronic display doesn't light up. It makes the noise it's supposed to but you can't figure out what it's doing because the electronic scoring screen doesn't display. The instructions and packaging don't come with a phone number and the web site referenced [...] has had a 509 bandwidth limit exceeded (too many people trying to access their site) for the past 3 days. I'll update this review if I ever get through but I'd recommend staying away from this one."
4,Battleplan (The complete series),"This is a good series for people who enjoy getting down to the ""nuts and bolts,"" particularly the serious military and/or history student or buff. If things going boom is what you want, this might not be for you. For the scope in which the series producers worked, I think it gives good insight on how senior military commanders must consider so many factors at the same time in planning a battle or campaign. It will give laymen a better appreciation of the thought processes of Flag and General officers. By comparing campaigns of different eras, it shows that while technology may change, many things do not, such as good leadership, skill, daring, and the will to win. I would also recommend this series to military wargamers who want to improve their skills in certain areas such as planning and analysis."
3,If at first you don't succeed...,"Keep trying to read this book until you get past the first 100 pages. Brin's works often have a tendency to be confusing and unfathomable --- but once you get into them they are impossible to put down. Unfortunately, Brightness Reef only raises questions and possibilities that might be answered in the next novel --- epic mysteries are raised (or roused, if you've read Startide Rising recently enough to figure out what's going on). It only starts to get exciting when it reaches the end of the novel, and by that time you have to get ahold of the sequel."
3,A necessary evil,"Skim this book. Brightness reef is by far the weakest of the 6 uplift bi-trilogy, it is slow paced, and for Brin, very poorly framed. The content in this volume which is relevant to infinity's shore could be put into about 40-50 pages, and as the fate of most of the characters in brightness reef, as well as the planet, aren't relevant to later volumes, there's no reason to plod through this book: treat it as research material o be skimmed and move onto Infinity's shore."
3,Sticks and stones galactic civilisation disappoints,"David Brin has made the all to common mistake of associating an argicultural society with an evnvironmentallyresponsible society. This book pretends to be how to manual for ultra green civiliasation. Just like 'Earth' this green force feeding of the reader ruins what could have been, like the other Uplift books, one to read again and again. One can only hope that the second and third parts of the trilogy lifts off into outer space and leaves the moralizing to the boring mud stuck natives. I want intergalactic intrigue, not home made paper and other green crud."
3,"Good, but not what I wanted.","Having read the first Uplift Trilogy (which got better with each book) I did what I rarely do and actually borrowed this one from the local library. (I don't like reading books I can't keep.) If I had not already been fascinated by Brin's Uplift universe I might not have finished this book (and thus would have missed the best parts). I agree with one of the other commenters here that Brin's Uplift universe is so good that maybe he should farm it out to writers who will give us more of it. (Those who are into role-playing games--I'm not--should know that there is a game for role-playing in the Uplift universe: Gurps Uplift. Gurps being some all-encompasing role-playing system that my son is into.) Here's hoping that this second trilogy, like the first, get's better as it goes along. (I wasn't very impressed with Sundiver, either, but Startide Rising was excellent and Uplift War was outstanding!"
1,"This series should be called ""Downlift Saga""","I found the worlds Brin introduced in the first three very interesting and kept me completely engrossed.Like many of the reviewers, I found the story lines choppy and the characters thin (Not to mention the fact that Brin sees fit to mention that the clans of Jijo were illegal squatters every 100 to 200 words through out the book).That'll teach me for not reading the readers reviews prior to buying a book.True swill. Entertaining if you like being brought to fits of anger while trying to skim the hundreds of pages of banality.Hope the 6 dollars you got from me helped, Mr. Brin. I doubt you'll get another dollar. Go write sitcom script or bad high budget movies - at least that wont be nearly as insulting.Times like this, I really miss Asimov (God rest his soul)."
1,Red Herring Trilogy,"I, like many other readers who reviewed Brin's Uplift Storm Trilogy, was very disapointed in how Brin managed his plots and characters. He continued to introduce new characters and plots at the expense of completely abandoning terrific plots and likable characters.My advice to you is don't waste your time with the Uplift Storm Trilogy. Read Startide Rising and the Uplift War (which are excellent), and then make up your own story about what happens to these plots and characters after you finish the books.After thousands of pages, I'm left with the impression that I was chasing a red herring - I should have spent my time reading other better books."
1,They Are Cheap For A Reason,"Other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason. Over 65% of the decks are marked and unusable. That means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be OK for poker play (unless you're lucky). I have purchase casino used cards before and honestly, they are not worth the trouble."
3,It's a shame...,"...the CZ isn't as good a quality as the ring. But for the price, a fun ring to wear."
1,Not what seller described.,I'm returning this ring! It is not real sterling silver. Real .925 sterling does not and will not bend and the CZ looks a lot worse than it does online. Very very disappointed.
3,nice starter,This is a nice starter ring. Beautiful cut and nice clarity. Should be sold in a larger size stone. My daughter loved it! Teenagers are not very careful with jewelry. The stone and band have maintained the color and gloss. Good Job.
4,Great Ring,"This is a really great ring. The only thing that I can complain about is that the metal of the prongs is discolored. It's gone from the beautiful silver to a copper color. I thought that sterling doesn't have discoloration. Other than changing color, this ring is great.Update: I've been wearing my ring for a while now, and when I first started wearing it I thought it was very durable but now it's really bent out of shape. The whole setting is crooked and bent back. Still looks good just a bit crooked."
4,A pretty good placeholder,"The ring is nice for the price. The stone is a very believable size. I didn't get any comments, so I'm not sure if people thought it was real or not, but I don't see why they wouldn't have thought it was real from a few feet away. The setting is not particularly elegant, and does look a little cheap, but that's to be expected for the price. The silver band is good quality and pretty sturdy. I wore the ring for 3 weeks, day and night, just as I do my real e-ring, and it was comfortable and still looked good. This ring was a good substitute while my e-ring was at the jewelers, but I'm glad to have my ring back. It's tough to look down and be satisfied with an imitation when you are used to the real thing. The ring size was very accurate (size 6). Also, a band won't sit flush with the ring because of the stone setting."
2,not what i expected,"this ring was not what i expected at all from looking at the photos and reading the previous reviews. the stone is not like the othe cubic zirconias that i have seen. it has this very defined ""X"" shape in the stone from the way they cut it. the metal is very very cheap. it gets scratched very easy. i guess its a good temp. ring till you can afford a real ring but dont expect anything more than a vending machine quility ring. thats exactly what my bf said when he saw it."
1,Not worth the money. Wouldnt buy this again,Stone fell out 4days of having the ring. i wish that i would of not bought this ring!! it was pretty and i liked the look and style. but its cheap
5,very pretty ring,this ring is very pretty. I also bought a 3mm plain wedding band and they go beautifully together. I would recommend this ring.
5,"Great guy, great book","After having him as a professor twice, I decided I liked his style of teaching well enough to take a look at his books. The Freewill Question is a great book arguing against Determinism. I really like it for several reasons. First, the opposing view (Determinism) is really given equal time in the book, and thus Dr. Davis' argument is all the more convincing. Second, the book is not simply some theory on the Free Will v. Determinism debate, but also an in depth review of the debate, starting in ancient philosophy and moving to 20th C. Third, Davis' writing style is very accessible, and therefore made it possible for me to read this book in one sitting. That to me is the hallmark of a good book."
5,A must-have for the woman athlete,"Whether you are a casual jogger or a world-class athlete, I can't think of a better book for a woman athlete to have at hand. Ms. Graham covers everthing: from competing during your period to choosing a sports bra. This should be the active woman's bible.The book is exceptionally well-organized. The first section of the book covers health concerns, while the second half of the book is a catalogue of sports in which women participate. Graham's language is straight-forward and friendly, with lots of great tips.It's about time a book like this was published. I'm just glad that it was written by the capable hands of Janis Graham, who has a stellar career as a freelancer covering women's health and fitness issues."
3,ok mess kit,on the low quality side of the fence but u do get what u pay for. on another review i read someone said it was like aluminum foil i think and thats pretty much right. but this mess kit is usable. u can pretty much only cook small quantities and the handle of the pan seems really weak. if ur looking for a mess kit to last then ur better off paying the extra money cuz this mess kit aint the one. i dont think id recomend this to anyone except if it was for a child or mayBe a Boyscout. if ur not careful this messkit will Break or Bend or proBly get a hole in it in a hurry.
2,Super flimsy. Just get a stainless steel cup instead.,"I guess if you need to cook 4 different things at the same time this might be worth it. But I'll never need that. The metal is so thin it practically bends when you touch it; now, that does mean that it's very light, so it's not all bad. It does fold up pretty small too. But the ""cup"" is about the right size for an espresso. So I'm not going to use this, I'm going to get a ""Stanley Adventure Camp Cook Set"" instead. It's a metal cup, with folding handle, lid, and comes with two plastic cups that fit inside. You can also fit a gas canister and stove if you remove one or both of the cups. This Coleman set does have a pot with a lid, so when I decided to get a cup I searched for a cup with a lid. I only found two, strangely. Most metal cups have no lid, which is very inefficient in that it wastes fuel."
3,light weight,I wanted a cheap light kit - and that's what this is. Don't expect to use it much.... very cheaply constructed and the pot is very small. But these cheaper kits have their uses.
1,Tiny and flimsy,"These are perfect for camping if you are 4 years old and camping in your backyard. They are so tiny, you cannot cook anything in them. If you tried they would probably disintegrate... Worthless."
3,Not a total waste,"I just went on a camping trip and used this product during that trip. I would not use the frying pan or any of the items over a fire. My brother-in-law had a skillet with much thicker metal and a wooden handle that worked better. The problem is that the frying pan handle gets too hot to handle without a glove and the metal warped after one use. I am still going to use this product as a mess kit, the frying pan will make a nice plate and the pot can be used as another bowl. I like the fact that the whole kit is so light and fits together before and after use, and when its dirty the whole set fits into a large zip-lock bag. However, I will be getting another product for the job of skillet for future camping trips."
5,now we're cooking,Coleman is a name you can trust for camping equipment and you can trust the mess kit that they make to work like it is suppose to. light and compact and easy to clean. Just what you need if you're backpacking and don't want extra weight
4,A very worthwhile starter book for azaleas and camellias.,"Thanks to this book, I have been able to grow many azaleas and some camellias, and they grow better than most others here. This book showed me the correct way to prune azaleas and when to do it. Because of this method, my azaleas filled out to large mounds that look like big drifts of color when they bloom. I had never grown azaleas or camellias before reading this book. I highly recommend it as a starter book for this subject. As mentioned in an earlier review, coffee grounds are an excellent fertilizer and a good addition to a compost bin."
4,one of few trikes with rubber on tires,"it's hard to find a tricycle with rubber treads on the wheels. most trikes and big wheels have hard plastic wheels which slip on the concrete when the kid pedals...i liked this one, it was easy to put together, except for the front decorative plate with Dora on it, but it wasn't necessary and my daughter doesn't know who Dora is so i just didn't put it on...the trike is small enough for a really petite or young child, which is why i bought it. we had a bigger trike (the Radio Flyer) which was no where near small enough for our 2 year old...my only complaint is that the bar that the seat is attached to and connects to the rear axle is just a little bit loose-fitting but it doesn't seem to be causing a problem. very good trike overall."
5,A book long overdue,"This is a GREAT book! The descriptions are concise and accurate, and the photographs are excellent as well. This guide is clearly head and shoulders above all other existing literature in terms of utility. If you can only buy one book about the islands, this is it."
4,Great toy; bizarre price,"My 4 year old daughter and her cousin love playing with this. There are enough pieces to share and it allows them hours of imaginative play. I like it because living in an apartment, toy storage space is limited. This is a reasonable size and can easily be packed up and out of the way. However, I do not understand how Amazon can charge $199.00 for this when the exact same item (I double-checked the style number) is available on the Playmobil website for $31.99. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume this is a computer glitch. Until they fix it I would not buy it here!"
3,First Playmobil Disappointment,"We have several playmobil sets, and this is the first that has been a disappointment. This is why:1. House is very narrow - almost impossible for small hands to set up beds as they are intended (see product pic) without them constantly falling out of house. The footboard of the bed rests on the very edge of the second floor and just plummets off.2. Beds and chairs come apart very easily - headboard falls off constantly, etc. They don't clip together as soundly as other playmobil accessories with other sets. We ended up supergluing them together.3. The halves of the house come apart too easily.4. There are no doors that open to the outside - going in and out is what kids love to do while playing with dollhouses.Just overall a disappointment, particularly for the money spent."
5,Tripod Bag,This was the only Tripod Bag that would fit my Bogen Model 3221 Tripod with the #3047 head attached. I love the padded bag and multiple versatility for carrying; highly recommended!
3,Waiting to get to the 50th state,"I had high hopes for this DVD to be as inspirational as ""Spirit of the Marathon"". In the end I was waiting for him to finally get done in New York. While challenging and difficult, I found this to be more of an homage to Dean than as a story of training hard and achieving a difficult challenge. He was pretty laid back, meeting people, and getting used to being a star as he ran marathons across the country. The challenge part of this feat did not come across."
5,Three Great Novels in One Edition,"Karen Kingsbury is a favorite author of mine. She writes truly life-changing inspirational fiction. You can't beat getting three of her novels in one edition.Where Yesterday LivesEllen returns to her childhood home after her father's death. She tries to make peace with people and events from her past. Ellen has no idea what God has in store for her.When Joy Came to StayMaggie and her family are on an uncertain journey with depression and all that comes with it. Faith in God will see them through. Having lived with clinicaldepression my whole life, this one really hit home.On Every SideFaith is a young woman who must make a stand for the truth of God in our uncertain world.I highly recommend purchasing this nicely-priced book.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
5,Kingsby Collection,I loved this collection and couldn't put it down until I real the whole collection. I am going to order more of her books in the next few days. I would highly recommended any of her books.
4,Good clean uplifting reading,Karen Kingsbury is a very talented and interesting story teller. One never has to worry about being exposed to sinful and profane writing with her books.
4,Samael's Black Metal Roots,"Excellent introduction to Samael's origins. Those who are familiar with the masterful Ceremony of Opposites will probably not be too surprised by the slightly more primitive & traditional black metal here, but those who climbed aboard later may be shocked. Although Worship Him is worth having, I mainly listen to Blood Ritual, which is full of classic songs with crushing dark riffs and unique atmosphere. ""After the Sepulture"" and ""Macabre Operetta"" are slow and doom laden, while ""Blood Ritual"" and ""Since the Creation"" are great occult thrashers. ""Total Consecration"" is one of the best black metal ""interlude"" pieces that I have ever heard, with building layers of piano and strings topped by Vorphalack's convincingly impassioned supplications to Satan. The last track, ""...Until the Chaos,"" opens up with a killer combination of awesome riff and truly bestial howls from Vorph that really evokes the title."
2,"Honestly, a disappointment","I felt that the book did not deliver at all what the title suggests. There is a VERY short section on eczema, and it is frankly contradictory to anything else I've read or been told by a professional. If you are buying this for the purpose of information/help with eczema, don't waste your time."
3,Lite jazz with a beat,"Yet another very bland album claiming to be dance tracks, that is mostly low-budget jazz tracks with an old fashioned dance beat. Even though it lists the songs by all sorts of artists, I swear it sounds like most of them are all by the same artist. I gave it 3 stars because there are actually a few real dance tracks, that I actually liked too."
3,Favorite Kids Cartoons,I am soo happy to have my favorite old time cartoons on DVD Format!! only downfall is that I cant play this CD on my IMac Computer.
2,Gave me a rash,I have a mild latex allergy so I was pleased to find this product on Amazon. I recently used two bandages over a two day period. When I took the first off - the area where the bandage had been was red. I thought that was from the skin being pulled during bandage removal. When I took the second off it was clear that I had a rash. It was the exact outline of anywhere the adhesive had touched. It took two weeks for the rash to heal. This product was not a winner for me.
1,Religious romance should be morally clean,"I would not recommend this book to anyone, because the use of sensual or passionate language was a hint of a bathroom scene and then them kissing for the first time with her wearing nothing but a bathrobe. I just couldn't finish it. I think that though it might be a nice book for some readers, it is not as clean as I have come to expect religious romance to be and therefore I was disappointed."
1,Flag Missing Grommet,TERRIBLE QUALITY! The top grommet on the US Flag was completely missing and the lower gromment was not correctly attached. Absoloutely not acceptable for a US made flag to have quality as poor as the flag that was sent to me. I called the phone number but could not leave a message because their box was full.
5,classic Miles,"Aside from the Miles/Coltrane box released last year, this marks the first time that this material has appeared in true stereo in over four decades. Prior to that, it was only available in mono or electronically re-channeled stereo. The title cut also marked the first time that Miles had written in the modal style that would be immortalized on the Kind of Blue album. Expanding the group to a sextet was one of the giants of alto sax, Julian 'Cannonball' Adderley. Adderley's style of playing complemented Coltrane's perfectly--at times requiring you to really listen closely to tell who's playing what. Both players had incredible range on their instruments. Milestones includes three bonus tracks--alternate versions of ""Two Bass Hit,"" ""Milestones"" which is actually superior to the 'original'), and Monk's ""Straight, No Chaser."" Milestones is a true classic album from a classic group."
4,I really enjoyed this CD,"I bought it a few years ago from Amazon and it comes out every year. I'd reccomend it for the adults, this CD is hilarious and you'll remember these songs for years to come."
5,Hysterical memories!,"Mr. Hankey the christmas poo, he loves me and I love you. LOL. This album has the Dredel song too. I also like Merry fu-king Christmas!"
3,Many of the Songs are Very Clever,But a few are just annoying; Most notably the with Shelley singing Three Ships ( ? )Should definitely be purchased to complete your collection of Eclectic Holiday Music.
4,4 songs listed here.,1 Pain Is Weakness Leaving My Body - Stampin' Ground2 As One/Never Forget - Stampin' Ground3 Hope Of Realisation - Knuckledust4 Won't Be Denied - Knuckledust
3,"Mind bending, sci-fi novel, fact vs fiction....","I have to say that this book is quite thick, but I've read the first half with great enthusiasm and interest. It was quite interesting, but at about half point it looses focus and it just drifts all over the place. There are some facts, some fiction here, it reads like a sci-fi novel.The book lost me when the main character ends up on some submarine with some weird guy that's searching for Atlantis with a help of a dolphin that tells him what to do. Bunch of mumbo jumbo, fantasy crap mixed in with bunch of conspiracy. You're better of reading ""Tragedy and Hope"", ""They own it all"", books of that sort, otherwise you will drown yourself in some twisted, conspiracy wishy washy fantasy, that will only make you question everything.This book is great for a teenager, but if you want some serious material, look elsewhere."
1,Biggest waste of my life,After several of my friends raved non-stop about the trilogy I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I was without a doubt the single biggest waste of my time. I tried to read it; I actually got through the first book and into the second one before my frustration overcame me. I did something that I have never done before I destroyed the book. I threw it into a foul disgusting gutter where it proceeded to fester and rot. I'm not kidding. I actually hated the book that much. Only the Mission Earth Series by L. Ron Hubbard comes close to being such a colossal stink bomb as this one.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Illuminatus! Trilogy is an omnibus edition of the bizarre craziness and streams of whatever the hell could be thrown into the mix that comprises:The Eye in the PyramidThe Golden AppleLeviathanSo, a good way to get all of this at once, if you can handle the weird that appears throughout this sort of thing."
5,Nice Little Epic,"I'm always on the search for bigger, more intricate, more experimental stories. Is this one? Sure...although it lacks a tight plot. But to have to a tight plot would defy the meaning of this book. If you are wondering if this one of the dreaded 'concept' books, ie a barrage of ideas and monologues that are scattered around in no particular context, well, it's not. Not really. What really makes it worthwhile, though, is it's staggeringly satiric tone, an irreverence for everything surpassing even that of the Simpsons. Though it feels a bit cocky and impressed by itself at times, it's all an illusion. This book is legit, and if you're the type that's always predicting the plot 2 chapters in advance, I defy you to do that. Matter of fact, I defy you to concisely summarize this plot. And if this review seems overly bizarre, let me put it plainly: BUY THIS BOOK."
1,Incoherent Garbage,"Maybe there's a story buried in this mess. Maybe it's even a great story. A lot of people seem to think so, but I found the method of narration so irritating that I quit reading this abomination as soon as I found that the second volume would carry on using it."
1,"Egoistic, Concieted pile of Rubbish","I was suprised about all the raving reviews of the Illuminatus. This book has no plot or structure. Characters, places and times switch in midsentence leaving the reader puzzled and confused. For most of the book the reader cannot even tell who or what he is reading about! The superflous barrage of facts (and fiction) assult the reader's senses in a disorganized and chaotic manner. All in all this book is the product of a highly ego-centerd, very arrogant, and drug induced author."
1,A poor man's Pynchon,"I hate to swim against the tide here, but this is a book for real intellectual lightweights. The book has fun passages but as a work is about as profoundly simple as they get. The question of whether reality is an illusion and consciousness a disease has been handled with much more erudition by better, funnier authors. As far as pure satire goes, try Douglas Adams first - he's funnier and less pretentious. If you're in that 'atheist/modernist/whateverist' school of thought, Pynchon answers this question much better in his novels (and he came up with the 'KCUF' joke first).And if you found the seventh grade epistemology in this book profound, well, you probably also thought 'The Matrix' was intellectual.In a bigger sense Umberto Eco solved the problem this trilogy asks in a much more profound and interesting opus, 'Foucault's Pendulum.' The difference? In 'Pendulum', the conspirator is the insane one."
1,Terrible,"Save yourself the money. While I am a big fan of comedic nonsense like Catch-22, this book provided no entertainment value to me whatsoever.I always finish what I read, but I had to put a gun to my own head to force myself through book 1, and I didn't consider for one second starting books two or three."
2,"Yeah, yeah, yeah","Ok, so it changed my politics (or just gave me a name to call ideas I already had) but did it really have to take 800+ excruciating pages? What a waste of time! fnord."
2,camel pelle moda does not bleed dye.,"I purchased the women's easton western boot in three colors, camel, brown and black, and the camel boot is the only one that does not bleed dye from the boot, onto my leg and into the pants I am wearing. It is unfortunate as the boot fits well and is attractive."
2,The God File,"I found this to be a very difficult book to read; perhaps because my views are different from those portrayed in the book. I did finish it and passed it on to a friend who said she could not finish the book and decided not to pass it further. Some people may identify with the author, but I was not one of them and neither was my friend."
5,Love my Feathers,"I can feel the wind blowing on my feet -- a most excellent feeling. These are great sneakers! As for performance on the courts, well, I'm totally satisfied."
2,"As usual, a so-so collection......","Just another average anthology. Contents include: 'Eudoric's Unicorn' by L Sprague de Camp; 'Shadow of a Demon' by Gardner Fox; 'Ring of Black Stone' by Pat McIntosh; 'The Lonely Songs of Laren Dorr' by George R. R. Martin; 'Two Suns Setting' by Karl Edward Wagner; 'The Stairs in the Crypt' by Clark Ashton Smith; 'The Goblin Blade' by Raul Garcia Capella; 'The Dark King' by C. J. Cherryh; 'Black Moonlight' by Lin Carter; 'The Snout in the Alcove' by Gary Myers; 'The Pool of the Moon' by Charles R SaundersWorth paying only a little for the Clark Ashton Smith story. Karl Edward Wagner is a great writer, but the Kane short stories were never too great."
5,The only thing wrong with this book is the title!,"As an instructor and a school owner, I have found this book to be the best resource for the new (and not so new) student or parent that I have yet come across. It is clearly written, well organized, an easy read, and is full of relevant information.It immediately gained a place in my school library and I have recommended it to my members and their families. You are not going to learn to be a martial artist here, but you're not going to learn it from any other book, either.The writers concentrate on the ideas and concepts of the art that are universal, rather than on being a step-by-step ""how-to"" manual on techniques: Something which is best left to the instructor, anyway.One very nice thing: It is not specifically devoted to any one Taekwondo organization to the exclusion of all others, a flaw I have commonly found in other beginner books.It's too bad this book is burdened with the unfortunate ""Idiots"" label, because it is a very smart choice."
5,best tools,"ive build about 4 computers and used random tools i find around the house. these are amazing, fit all screws and didnt trip any of them."
1,"Totally unneccessary product-- DUPLICATES '58 SESSIONS, BUY THAT INSTEAD","The music is fantastic, some of the best of the best period. But why buy this thin set when you can get this whole album (minus If I were a bell, which is recorded just as well in Live at the Blackhawk)as the second half of '58 MILES (or '58 sessions, can't remember) that includes stellar studio renditions of Fran Dance, Stella by Starlight, and On Green Dolphin Street? Spend a buck more and download If I Were a Bell--otherwise, this set--more attractively packaged, mind you--is a complete duplicate of a superior album (although the sound on each is suspect).Edit:I now see that '58 sessions is out of print on CD and somehow never got the full 24 bit legacy treatment,but buy a used version. The full set (that was the same price as jazz at the plaza) ought to have been or should be rereleased!"
2,the thing that came from the vaults,"I would have loved to get a new Miles Davis recording from this my favorite MD period.... There is a reason why Columbia kept this in the vaults for 40 years.On the first cut, ""If I were a bell"" , Miles Davis is WAY off mike, the drummer and the background talking are louder than he is! Like he was playing into a dead mike! Coltrane trys to see how many abrasive, too fast notes he can jam into each measure. Tempos are too fast.This was a press conference to ""Introduce"" the group to the press. A party. The sextet went through the motions.Get ""Round Midnight"" instead. Recording is bright and details etched.A weak two stars for performance, zero stars for recording quality."
5,Very Comfortable,I have a pair of these and love them. I've gotten so many compliments on them that I purchased a pair as a Christmas present for a friend of mine!
1,Warning: CinemaScope Widescreen altered to 1:33 (Full Screen),"For: Fraulein(1958)Studio: Twentieth Century Fox Film CorporationDVD Release Date: June 20, 2012Warning: CinemaScope Widescreen altered to 1:33 (Full Screen)5 Stars - for the movie.1 Star - for butchering this great movie."
3,a fairy tale of WW2,"In the mid-50s Hollywood decided to forgive Germany and produced a wave of pictures with ""good Germans,"" non-Nazis caught up in the war. Erika Angermann is better than good, a lovely and virtuous young woman adrift in Berlin during the last days of the war and the Soviet and American occupation. She faces sexual degradation, but it's 50s Hollywood degradation, meaning that whenever she is about to lose her virtue, luck or a savior intervenes. If you want to know what German women really went through, see ""A Woman in Berlin,"" but if you want an entertaining fairy tale, ""Fraulein"" is for you. Dana Wynter is lovely and plangent as Erika, and Mel Ferrer is dashing as her Prince Charming in U.S. Army fatigues."
5,Dramm 15005 Lawn Sprinkler,EXCELLENT Sprinkler. Amazing how much money you save when you buy one GOOD sprinkler rather than buying 2-3 per year of a less expensive one (translate: cheap!). I'm exceedingly happy with this.Dramm 15005 ColorStorm Premium Metal Oscillating Sprinkler with Brass Nozzle Jets
1,It really works! Then.. Falls apart :-(,"I am pleased with the results. My grandsons love it, my plants and yard love it. This is a winner in my book. This type of sprinker tends to stop and or barely last a watering season. We made it through with flying colors. Do not waste your time with a home center. Amazon saves time and money. You do not have to chase people around for help.I lied. It did not make it to the next season. It is in 3 separate parts after I turned on the water. Not surprised but, very disapointed. For those who had good luck, I salute. However it is a gamble with these things, I lost."
4,Fun show with classic ladies,"Tape was in great shape and played without any problems. Since VHS tapes have been around now for over 25 years many of them have started to deteriorate and can sometimes stick and damage your machine, especially the real cheap tapes. As far as the content of this tape..Loved Lesley Gore & Ronnie Spector! A fun show with good performances by all. Keep in mind this a show done live in the 80's and not vintage clips from the 60's. Well worth the price if you've never seen this HBO special."
3,PRETTY GOOD,I STARTED THIS BOOK IN JAN... IM JUST FINISHING IN APRIL.. NOT BECUZ IT WASNT GOOD PLUS LIKED THE STORY..BUT SOMEWHERE IT SLOWED ME DOWN..... I USUALLY READ BOOKS PRETTY FAST. ITS A NICE READ. NOT ONE OF MY BEST....
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"i bought this bike(in the mermaid ariel theme)for my 2 year old daughter. the manufactor's age for this bike is 1 1/2 year and up. this bike is awful. the seat is set up like it would be on a normal bike BUT, the pedals are attached to the FRONT wheel like a tricyle- which make it IMPOSSIBLE for a child to reach the pedals while sitting on the seat. my 4 year old son can reach the pedals but, he even has a hard time riding it. its truly a waste of money and if i could find the receipt, i would take it back! it was a huge disappointment-as a Christmas gift. Whoever designed this bike did not have a child in mind. there is no way a child could ride this bike comfortably even if they could reach the pedals."
5,Worked for my dog,"I bought these for the omegas, my little dog came with dry skin at 7 months from a breeder. I gave her these with good food and her skin improved greatly. No more dry skin."
4,Excellent edition of an obscure literary tradition,"Native literatures from around the world have enjoyed a surge of popularity in the past few decades, and this volume is a good example of why that is so. The Aboriginal song poems have been ably translated, but the editors decided to have the poems in their original languages facing the English versions. This adds much to the feel of a foreign, exotic literature. Explanatory notes are placed with the original versions, causing some difficulty in switching from page to page reading the translation and then the explanation (the meanings of passages are not always clear from the translation). The selections cover four distinct literary traditions within Aboriginal Australia, from varying geographical locales. This allows the reader to appreciate the wide variation in Aboriginal culture."
4,Trades readability for depth and rigor,"This text is best suited for very good students who are motivated, comfortable reading English at a high level and mathematically adept: other students would be served much better by a different book. It contains far more material than could possibly be covered in a standard freshman general chemistry sequence, even with a good class. The authors assume that their audience is composed of the students I described initially (I am told it is the textbook at MIT), and leave it to the instructor to ""break it down"" for the students. Initially, I was not fond of this book, but I have slowly changed my mind, and I believe I have a better grasp of introductory chemistry thanks to the extra depth it goes to and the challenges it made me rise to."
1,The American Farriers Journal,I have been a horse owner for thirty years. I have never read any publication that is so one sided and biased. The articles have no basis of any scientific studies what so ever.
4,Nightmare Soundtracks,"This CD by Vlad Kerovnian sounds like the audio equivalent of the Hieronymous Bosch paintings reproduced inside the booklet -- dark, foreboding, creepy, anxiety-producing....Utilizing slow mournful synthesizer chords, white noise exhalations and veiled whispers, this album will drop the temperature in any room by 20 degrees, guaranteed."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Author Michael S. Malone goes behind the myths about Apple Computers to present an in-depth history from Apple's start-up in 1976 to its decline through 1998. He emphasizes that the personalities of Apple founders, Steven Jobs and Steven Wozniak (or Woz), marked Apple's corporate culture with a kind of insaneness that made it great even as it contributed to the company's difficulties. He presents the two Stevens as deeply flawed individuals - one the creative, socially inept, technical genius, the other the narcissistic, untrustworthy tyrant. In places, Malone risks introducing distortions into the story in the interest of drama, especially when he imagines what Woz or Jobs might have been thinking or why they may have taken certain actions. Otherwise, we at getAbstract say sit down in your easy chair with this novelistic business history. Even those who are familiar with the broad outlines of the Apple story will find it fascinating."
2,A library read,"Typo laden and factual errors-- and NO citations. (Come on!)I enjoyed reliving some of the computing history that I grew up in, but one error for example describes the Atari 2600 as their venture into the home computing market (it was simply a cartridge based game machine to my recollection). Malone also seems to want to villify Jobs and portray everyone else as having a tragic flaw as if this was all a giant Greek tradgey. I had to return this book to the library as I became sickened by the arrogance and personalities, backstabbing, and ruthless (anti)corporate politics of the Silicon Valley business world portrayed here.Of course it could all be true."
5,A Great Debut,"Although I am not given to normally read historical fiction-based stories, I decided to read this one. The story concept intrigued me.This was such an enjoyable read, and has got me wondering what I have been missing all these years. I had always heard of authors like C.S. Forester (author of the Horatio Hornblower series), Alexander Kent (whose real name is Douglas Reeman, and author of The Richard Bolitho series) and Patrick O'Brian (author of the Master & Commander series) I had seen motion pictures derived from their respective works... but had always been reluctant to read them.Personally, I have always liked my historical reading to be, well... historical.This two-in-one volume has gotten me to reconsider my thinking, and to look deeper into the realm of such works of historical fiction. It's a relaxing read, and a great escape from the worries of the day. This was such a pleasure to read, and a welcomed addition to my collection."
5,Tail-kicking punk Christian Rock,"The Christian equivalent of Avril Lavigne. Check out ""Hello/Goodbye"". My 17 year old daughter loves it."
3,Totally Hits?,"Looking one year back lets see if it was Totally Hits 2002 (more platinum hits)1.Don't Let Me Get Me-Pink #272.All You Wanted-Michelle Branch #213.I Need A Girl (part one)-P.Diddy ft.Loon and Usher #74.Just A Friend-Mario #245.U Don't Have To Call-Usher #226.Heaven (remix)-DJ Sammy ft.Yanou #257.Full Moon-Brandy #188.Awnaw-Nappy Roots DID NOT CHART9.If I Could Go-Angie Martinez DID NOT CHART IN JULY10.Satillie-POD DID NOT CHART11.Here Is Gone-Goo Goo Dolls DID NOT CHART IN JULY12.Get Here-Justin Guarini DID NOT CHART13.Out Of My Heart-BBMak DID NOT CHART14.All Eyez On Me-Monica DID NOT CHART15.Gridin'-Clipse DID NOT CHART16.Hate To Say I Told You So-The Hives DID NOT CHART17.Adrienne-The Calling DID NOT CHART18.Donnell Jones-You Know That I Loved You DID NOT CHART19.Boyz II Men-The Color Of Love DID NOT CHART20.Ian Van Dahl-Castles In The Sky DID NOT CHARTWow! That's a lot of songs that did not chart. And by the way, the chart was made at the very end of June so,it's pretty accurate."
4,I Can Relate,"I can relate to this book, since I had a similar thing happen in my marriage. Unlike the character in the book, we did get divorced. I can understand some feelings/actions that Kari had/did but it's not that easy to be 'perfect' when something like this happens. Her family was helpful and understanding and some had the same reactions that most people would-divorce him. It tells Kari and Tims emotions throughout and shows what can happen when we don't appreciate one another and communicate."
3,Story of redemption and hope.,"Karen Kingsbury's book ""Redemption"" was like a self help book in story form. I liked how the message of redemption and hope were well written about, and might be encouraging to anyone struggling in a relationship.I did, however, have a couple of complaints with ""Redemption"". First, Kari who decides to stay with her unfaithful husband makes a noble choice, but at times comes across as too much of a saint. Yes, she sheds some tears and has doubts and fears, but for a woman who has been dealt such a big blow the depth of her hurt seemed minimal.Another complaint I had was that I had a hard time really identifying with any of the characters. Although I have to say Tim, the unfaithful husband, seemed the most real in his struggles with God and himself.""Redemption"" in the end was not a bad book, it just didn't spark anything in me. I do have a friend, though, who loves the whole series, and it has really ministered to her."
4,Cute little romace story.,"If it were a novel I would describe it as good for the beach. This is an easy to watch movie with no real surprises. No it won't win any Oscars but it is a fun movie with a little bit of eye candy and even a couple of butt shots. The boys are cute, fun and even bitchy at times. What gay boy isn't? There is even some character development and as a result this viewer was happy overall about the end result.Looking for ""Great Film"" look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a diversion it's a good buy."
5,Richard's a blast!,"I popped in these tapes after not having used them for a few years, and found that they are still fun. Great cardio workout, and Richard's attitude is upbeat and infectious. The other background exercisers in the tape seemed to have a lot of fun, too. The dance steps may take a few viewings to get down, but I don't find them difficult. These tapes might make for a good warmup for an intermediate or advanced user."
5,It's a smoooth operator!,"After using my Braun 8585 shaver for a month I've come to the conclusion that it doesn't seem to shave any closer than my elderly Braun 6520. BUT, it's so much quieter and smoother that I'm delighted that I've switched. I actually went back for a few days to the veteran Braun and tried again but the assault on my ears was suddenly intolerable -- it was no contest.It feels as though you are shaving with velvet -- and that's smooooth! I guess it's a case of not just shaving - but shaving in style."
1,When Hippies Make Movies...,"...This is the result! A disjointed dog-log of a ""film"" about (what else) a guy and his hippie friends who inherit a ranch. An old caretaker soon tells the tale of the headless horseman and his curse, which (supposedly) brings about the deaths of a few of the fuzzy young people. Unfortunately, this is all shot through a home-movie camera by someone who must have seen MANOS and said, ""Wow! Now THAT'S a movie!"" While not as mind-scorchingly awful as say, FRANKENSTEIN ISLAND, it's close! Yecch!..."
2,"Costs more, quality poor","I have enjoyed Hitchcock and Ellery Queen for many years. The Kindle editions are crude renditions of these high quality publications. The transcriptions are filled with errors, especially replicated lines of text or odd insertions of text as a result of typesetting or scanning artifacts. The magazines include some illustrations, and since the originals are newsprint the monochrome pictures should be beautifully rendered on Kindle. Instead, they are often poorly scaled and blurry or blotchy. Sometimes, a JPEG filename appears instead of the picture.A little proofreading would go a long way. I have canceled my subscriptions."
4,not too bad,i think it is good for 40 bucks. It cann't compare with those cost your 100 bucks. But it is good enough for average requirement.
5,"Very Comfortable, Great Quality, Discount Price","Not only is this headset affordable, but it's very comfortable to wear and the quality of the components is greater than I would expect. The boom is flexible and can easily adjust to where you need it to be and the headphones sit comfortably on my ears. The adjuster on the wire is a good touch and I've found it useful. Great product."
4,Decent headphones,"The sound and mic quality are good, but it bothers my ears after an hour or so. Also, it would have been nice if the back was adjustable to fit my head. One aspect that was annoying was that the mic cannot go all the way around to the back, in case you want it out of your way. Overall, good quality for the price, just know the drawbacks of the design."
2,very bad,The microphone stopped working after a week and the headphone frame is really uncomfortable around the ear. I returned it and got my money back.
2,Mic can't reach!,"This is a really great set of headphones, except that I have a problem getting the microphone to register my voice. When I wear them properly, I have to talk very loudly for the microphone to pick up my voice, and I'm using full gain in the operating system. So, I'm now wearing these around my neck and then extending the microphone up in front of my mouth so people can hear me. I'm running everyone's voice through my regular computer speakers. This works, but clearly it isn't pretty and it isn't the intent of the product. So, I'm looking for something else."
4,Hard of the Ears....But not the sound,"I play for long periods of time and I use it for my ventrilo server. After awhile it does tend to pinch the tops of your ears and make them sore, but really all you have to do is readjusted them every so often and they work fine. The sound quality is amazingly good and for the money they are well worth it.I also use it for skype and people say they can hear me better then ever, also highly recommened."
4,Perfect product for the money,"After fine tuning the mic boost and the headphone level, this thing worked like a charm. no deep bass for gaming but who cares when your on a budget. people heard me fine and i didn't get any response of background noise, considering there is almost a tv on behind me! great product, great price, logitech is were its at."
5,Pretty good,"I use this headset for chatting with family and the quality has been really good so far. Can't comment on what it would be like for gaming, but as far as a headset, it's a pretty good one. You do have to have the mic pretty close (a few inches is OK) for the other person to hear. Sometimes I'd like to just rest it on the desk to use only the mic and listen through our speakers, but it does have to be closer than that."
2,These will irritate your ears to the point of madness!!!,"I recently these from Amazon and I must say that I'm extremely dissapointed in them... They have really weak sound... it's very light on the bass and overall the sound is just not that impressive but the worst thing about them is that because you have to put them behind you ears, it will irritate the hell out of them!!! I had to stop using them because I feared it would've given me blisters...bad sound, bad bass and definately BAD DESIGN!!!"
2,Ouch!,"This product looks great in the images here on Amazon and the internet but once you put the headset on, especially if you are wearing glasses, you ears will be killing you by the end of the night. For some reason the headset has a long crack along the part that goes around your head where the wire is held. That is what hurts the user really bad because it sort of cuts into your ear. And after about two months the headset gave up."
5,No problems at all!,"I have had no problems whatsoever with this product thus far. I used it for several straight hours the first day i had it, and even with my glasses found it very comfortable. The mic quality is very good and i use it to internet chat all the time with crystal clear pickup. Even though the mic is not right infront of your mouth, it still pickups very well with no need to yell into it.The only downside to this product is that the cord and plugs feel cheap and flimsy.I would most deffinatly buy this product again however."
4,Good overview of the war,I wanted to read a concise overview of the Falklands war to add to what I remembered from the time. The Osprey books generally do a good job with quick overviews and this one was just what I wanted with the right amount of detail.
3,Pretty good for a cheap upgrade for built in TV speakers,"Cons: Weak subwoofer, very light & flimsy speakersPros: At about $10/speaker, an inexpensive way to go from very poor TV speakers to moderate speakersThe speakers provide better sound quality than the ones in my old TV, and it was fun to have a cheap surround sound experience. But, you definitely get what you pay for - don't expect a tremendous performance from these cheapies, but they are definitely adequate for moderate entertainment."
2,"sentimental, repetitive, dull",Wish something happened in the book or even it the little that did happen was explained. The story tried to be mysterious but ended up being annoying.All one dimensional characters.
3,Good writing but boring,"Sure the writing is good, but I can't get into this book. I keep wanting to skip chapters, but since I paid for it I feel guilty. So instead it's been sitting on the floor next to my bed for weeks.If you're not really into plot - and some people aren't, they're more into character - this may be perfect for you. But it's driving me crazy! And I certainly won't be buying anything else by this author.I am also completely turned off by the back cover, where Charles has a photograph of himself that takes up two thirds of the page. Click into the book - the publisher won't even show the back cover on Amazon. It just says loads about his character - perhaps incorrectly - which makes me want to smack the arrogance out of him. I can't imagine why he thinks I'd rather stare at his face than get information about his book. It stretches my creativity to imagine him as a nice person."
1,disaponting,"i could not figure out why it got such good reviews.the book is boreing predictable and took me three weeks to finish since I looked for anything else to do but read.I do not like to stop reading books in the middle but this one got very close to that, do not waste your time."
4,Used for protection against bed bugs,"In an attempt not to bring bed bugs home from trips, I've starting to protect my clothes and luggage while traveling. This basically means keeping things in bags and thus limiting possible exposure. These bags are the right size for storing an outfit or a bag full of underwear. Like another reviewer mentioned, I've had a couple of bags split on me - luckily at home and not away from home. However, you might want to pack a few spares."
5,Delicious,"These soups are so amazing. They are more expensive than campbell's, but have significantly more nutrition per cup and more flavor too! I don't think I can live without these, and as a vegan most Nile soups make an EXCELLENT way to get in my protein and nutritional needs. Not to mention the subscribe and save program saves me a ton on groceries."
5,Great price for a favorite product,"I've loved Nile Spice soups for many years, and the Black Bean is my all-time favorite. Super-handy as long as you have access to boiling water - just add, stir and wait a few minutes. Quick, hot and satisfying. Natural enough that they are carried at my local health/organic food co-op. This is a great price for a dozen."
3,Easy and filling,"I have been eating this Nile Spice soup and the Red Beans and Rice for lunch for a few years. What I like about this is it is fast, easy, filling, tons of fiber and although not organic it doesn't have a lot of crap in it.My only complaint is the texture. I switched to this after eating Nutrisystem Black Bean Tortilla soup which was just too expensive to keep eating. Unlike the NS soup which has big hunks of bean, this is much smaller pieces so the texture is a little flat. IT also has peppers in it so for those who don't like them this isnt for you. Its not spicy though.Still, I will continue to eat these. I suggest letting it sit in the hot water for a good 10 minutes to really soften everything up."
4,the language barrier...,"The Fruits Basket CD Drama was.... *pause* a disappointment -_-. CD Dramas are always a lot of fun. But I guess they aren't very fun when you can't understand them!! Yes, this CD Drama is in Japanese!! If you can't understand Japanese, then this is a waste of your money. I suggest you steer clear of this item!!If you /can/ understand Japanese, then please continue in this reveiw ^^. The pamphlet art is very beautiful. It features a lot of information about the characters and is displayed beautifully! ^^. Everything [the cover, pamphlet, CD disk design, ect.] are so beautiful and cute X3This item is definitely worth its expensive price if you can understand Japanese. If you can't, I'd reeeeally lay off on this purchase [maybe wait for the English version..?]"
4,Crazily expensive!,"This is a really good Audio CD featuring the OP and ED of the Anime ""Fruits Basket"", which is why you shouldn't be surprised to have the songs in Japanese!Includes many other instrumental music from the Anime. Really one of those MUST BUYS (including 'Memory for You' and 'Four Seasons') if you're an avid fan of ""Fruits Basket"" (either the Anime or Manga).However, the MAJOR turnoff would be the price. I can get half (and even less) of the shown price at other places! The price is really disappointing..."
2,Overated book,"This book provides you with the basics of strategies of chess. However the ideas are very basic and the author doesnt elaborate as much as he should. I would suggest getting the ""amateur's mind"" by Geremy Silman which has the same ideas and is a more robust book."
3,Harmonic and deep,"I really enjoyed Harmony of the Spheres when I first listened to a song on the CD through Yahoo music called ""Jessamine"". After reviewing the entire CD I can say that the music is a little 'out there' and maybe a little too much for me, however I do enjoy listening to it and it's kind of growing on me. I would recommend listening to some of the songs before buying, but over-all I am glad that I have such a CD for my collection."
4,It works,"Two years ago I weighed 350 lbs and had health problems. Cold turkey I started eating fruits and vegetables for lunch and breakfast and a regular dinner and started using Leslie Sansone's tapes daily. At first I could not even do 15 minutes but now I do 3 miles and I am in better shape and have more energy and have lost 116 lbs so far. I credit Leslie with helping me through this. The tapes are so easy to follow, you can do them in the privacy of your home in air conditioning with a small amount of space. Her tapes are just wonderful and I have many different versions in case I want to change. I couldn't live without them and have recommended them to many people who have also lost weight. They are the best"
2,Walk Away The Pounds Abs,"A little better than the fat burning, she need a more intense walk rountine and do something with that music, it really sucks."
4,"Great reference, but wordy.","Bell does a great job explaining the philosophy underpinning futures studies. For those who are not as well versed in this area, he gets into arguments on terminology, which to me was often unnecessary and verbose. I personally disagree with some of his assessments of terminology. Still that does not take away from the fact this is an excellent reference which anyone engaging in futures studies should read."
3,Very casual,"These are good for everyday wear, but not at all dressy despite being pearls. On the picture the silver looks all soft and bright, but in real life it looks a little more like stainless steel. The hooks are wide and I have already lost and found them once. Probably would not buy again, would rather have something a bit dressier that can go both casual and dress up."
1,Amazon is failing its customers!,I recently got an email from Amazon regarding the matter that the speakers that I ordered couldnt get to me for some weird reason. I noticed that the speakers were still been sold on your website but at $13 more than they were originally posted. Was this fare at all to get rid of my order and then increase the price up to $53 from $30 and then come up with an excuse on not to deliver the speakers to me?Ever tried trying to get a hold of any one in Amazon? You will really really really disappointed..Can any one help?
2,designed for a midget!! Wait for something better!,"sitting on top will hurt you because of its poor design. The bottom part should reach another inch and a half to the front.Could at least be another inch longer on main part top to bottom too. In my opinion, Doc Johnson should offer at least 3 sizes of this toy because anyone over 4 ft. tall might find this toy uncomfortable in certain positions. Also the top part on the longest part could be just a little thicker in circumference and instead of a dumb handle for the bottom that robs another inch of fun and adds to the discomfort, it should be a flared base instead! Bottom line, wait for an improved version and don't waste your money!"
5,Excellent product!,"This is a great yogourt maker, I like the timer as well. I use it to make goat milk yogourt, which is very tasty."
5,The Blenders do it again!,"When It Snows is a MUST HAVE for your collection! Filled with The Blenders incredible arrangements and harmonies, this CD will make you laugh, cry, and sigh with utter contentment. If you love NOG you will love this CD as well, it is every bit as good and (if my kids' reactions are any indication)even more fun. If you don't own NOG yet, you are totally missing out, you need to buy both of them right away! As an avid collector of Christmas music (a cappella and otherwise) I can assure you, it just doesn't get any better than this!!!"
3,Clever but needs improvement,Decent product with a few areas for improvement:1) User Manual hard to follow2) You can not turn the unit off.
5,Awesome Album,Maysa is a great artist that needs to be on the same level with an Anita Baker or Sade. Her smooth vocals and silky jazz sound makes her a must for smooth jazz listners.
3,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"At first I was kinda excited about the fact that the Metropolis label was bringing on an industrial band that still use guitars in thier music....however, after purchasing this album, I found myself a little dissapointed. There are a handfull of good tracks on this album, ...but overall, it's just repetitive, whiney, and kinda reminicent of sell out bands like Gravity Kills and Stabbing Westward. At one point I felt like I was listening to the industrial version of The Backstreet boys. Despite these negative remarks, the songs that are good keep the album on my shelf."
2,"Didn't make smoothies well, and now it's dead","Mine lasted 20 months - Dec 2005 to Aug 2007. The motor starts, but if you give it any ""load"" - for example, blending something thicker than orange juice - the blade stops and the motor keeps spinning inside. In 2006 the plastic coupler broke like the other reviewer's did; Braun sent me a replacement ""immediately"" but somehow it took three weeks to get here.I was using it for frozen fruit smoothies - adding a bit of frozen fruit at a time until it was thick enough like a Jamba Juice. Even then, I had to stop the blender and mix with a spatula to clear the air pockets. Not great. I'm writing to Braun but I'm not hopeful - will update this review with what I find.I paid $49.99, and got 19 months of use, so if I consider it a $2.50-per-month rental ... ?"
3,Overrated,"When I finally decided I needed a blender instead of just using my food processor for pureeing, I chose this one because of the top ratings given it by America's Test Kitchen. Obviously, they never tried mixing waffle batter in it and I find it hard to believe they managed to blend frozen fruit. There isn't enough suction to the bottom of the container to blend anything thick at any speed -- the food just sits there and you constantly have to scrape it down. It does a fine job on raw berries, for instance, but frozen or partially frozen ones just sit there. It can't handle batter at all. Decidedly unimpressive. On the plus side, it is a really attractive unit and is very easy to disassemble, clean and put back together. This is probably a fine unit for someone who just wants to blend juices or puree cooked soups, but I find it hard to believe this is supposed to be one of the best on the market."
3,Light use only,"Initially, my wife and I were very happy with this product when we purchased it back in Feb 2007. But now in June 2008 it is dying after only light usage.It does seem have a very powerful motor and seems to make small batches of smoothies or margaritas with frozen fruit as long as you don't fill it more than 1/3 - 1/2 full. Our usage has been light, probably 3x a week at the most.Here we are 16 months later and it has started a ""screaming"" noise and it definately sounds (smells) like it is starting to burn out.Granted it is an inexpensive blender and maybe we should have used it more for ""blending"" instead of crushing. It just seems we just haven't used it that much. This time around we've got to find something that is tailored to the task with a better track record."
4,great blender!,"I make smoothies and protein shakes every morning and this blender is fantastic. I've only made soup once and didn't lock the clear plastic section of the top into the place, so some came out and splattered, but as long as I remember to lock it into place it's fine.Great blender and I'm very happy with it."
2,"Braun MX2050 ""PowerLAX""","After several blender buys(cheaper) I ordered the Braun; simple dial, glass jug, brand name,Consumer Reports review, etc. The nylon(?) teeth under jug looked flimsy and after the first use I realized that there were only 2 speeds. The highest of which made the unit twirl around the counter top. Sent it back and expect to have to pay more for a better blender."
1,BE WARNED: Now on my third set of blades!!!,"This blender works very well. I make smoothies at least 3 times a week and if you put the wet ingredients in first, then the frozen, the smoothies come out blended very nicely. Yes, it's powerful, BUT, it is absolutely true that the teeth on the blade break off. I've had this blender for about 18 months and I am now on my third replacement blade. At about $15 a pop, this blender is becoming exceedingly expensive. The only reason I'm not throwing it out is because I don't want another piece of electronic filling up our landfills. Be warned that you WILL need to replace the blade mechanism with continued use."
2,plastic gear lost teeth,"consumers report rated this as a good buy, so i did.almost all the teeth came off very quickly........"
3,Not the usual quality,"Powerful motor, great looks but the very important knife assembly attached to the jar is the cheapest of any I've ever seen on a blender. Am wondering how long the tinny knife will last.This thing was made in the Czech Republic but was advertised as being made in Germany."
1,one of the regular blender,It is OK blender. One thing I hate this blender is the cover is not tight when load is more than 2/3. I am tired to clean the mess.......
1,Junk,Unusually flimsy product. The wood is of such poor quality that the handle cracked after only a few weeks.
2,Broke after two weeks,"So as far as the brush and bristles go, I like this. The bristles aren't too hard or two soft, and it is pretty great.That said, the handle sucks. It broke with only light pressure after about 2 weeks, and you can see many others have had the same problem. I have no idea how these other people with the high ratings actually use this thing without breaking it."
4,Back brush,I like this brush. The bristles are nice and soft and I like the soft hand grip. I think it will last as well.
1,Bad Handle,The handle drops off the brush end within a week. I can't figure out why the manufacturer doesn't fix this problem.
1,Disappointing - not for use in bath or shower,I have been using it for less than a month and the wood handle has split. should not be used near water - but then isn't supposed to be a bath brush? I'm not sure what they were thinking.
3,3rd brush in 7 years,"This is the 3rd brush in more than seven years, the previous two were excellent, and I could use them on most of my bodyThis brush is just a bit too abrasive than the prior two.and unfortuantely I can only use it on my feet.Just not what they use to be."
1,"Unreliable, no support","I've had photoshop elements 2.0 for about a year. It reams your memory, and all of a sudden just quit working. I have reinstalled it twice, it still wouldn't load a picture.The website has no support.Camera software is better. Don't waste your money."
2,NO GOOD,"I cannot increase the size of a picture. I have tried and tried and the book is not any help. I am gonna try another program. I had Corel on my very old computer and loved it, but the cost is very high. SOOOOO I bought this. NEver again"
5,Best of the bunch,"I recently purchased this package, and compared to the other programs I have tried, this one does seem to have the most power for its price range.It is very easy to enhance photos that are a little overexposed, underexposed, or need to have the color saturation tweaked.It did not come with the exact printer template I wanted, but I found a read me file that gave me enough information so I was able to easily open an existing printer template in notepad and modify it to give me the template I wanted.It was also a simple matter to create a slide show in PDF format that I could send to others. They only needed to have the Acrobat reader to view the slide shows.The ability to make panoramas from a series of shots is the best I have seen (compared to 3 other products).This program is definitely a keeper. I have uninstalled all the others that I tried before finding this one."
3,"Nice, but you need more","I own a lot of Adobe products, and Photoshop elements was a good choice. However, I noticed that, unless you are familiar with the way Adobe works or have other Adobe products already installed on your computer, this is not the best product you can buy. For people with less experience with Adobe products, programs like Windows Editor or just being creative with Paint in the Microsoft Office Program. If you must use this program (Because it can do really fascinating things) I recommend putting the online tutorials in your bookmarks. You might need them."
1,BUYER BEWARE !! NOT ENOUGH INFO ON PRODUCT PAGE !!!!!!,"I got this for my MacBook with OS X and Dual-Core Intel Processor. Unfortunately, Elements 2.0 isn't compatible with Macs with Intel processors. This was nowhere in the description of the product, which is odd because Intel processors in Macs are fairly common these days. So, basically I've got great software I bought to use on my MacBook, but instead can only use it on my PC.I'm leaving a poor rating not because it isn't a quality product, but because buyers are so poorly warned of compatibility conflicts. The aforementioned rating only applies as long as this information is absent."
3,Book had great promise,"The premise of this book is definitely an interesting one. The author of this book solicited the help of his chef friends and created a compilation of recipes for dishes that chefs cook when they are ""off duty"" at home. While a good portion of the recipes seemed to fall in line with the book's theme, there were also just as many recipes that didn't look like they were done at home so much as at a michelin star rated restaurant. I am an avid cook and am more than comfortable around the kitchen but still felt incredibly overwhelmed by some of these recipes. Some of them boasted a 30+ item ingredient list along with an even more daunting set of instructions on how to make the dish. For me, the best part of this book was reading the interviews with all the chefs and learning where they find their inspirations from among other interesting factoids.Bottom line: The recipes are hit or miss. The book is chockfull of photos and interesting interviews."
4,Geat inexpensive hypercardiod for indoor film mic.,"I use this on a boom pole for indoor video audio. Great quality for the price, cuts down significantly on echoing issue you get with a shotgun mic indoors."
3,PALEONTOLOGY,At first very excited. Too much repetition and found some appelations peculiar. Would like to have seen some classics scholars consulted.And not one American paleontologist cited - unless I just mised it. Not much talk about migration theories. the ancient Greeks understood even more than she gives them credit for - check out myths as well as legends - there's a reason for myth.
1,Lame,"I read the reviews (below) on this book and I decided to give it a try. I can say now that I fully agree with the review (below) of 'UNEXCITING, UNIMAGINATIVE, UNINSPIRING, and UNFUNNY'.On lighter notes, looking into a future field of creative writing, I did learn one important thing from reading this book, that it doesn't take talent to get published."
1,worst kids educational book ever,Book is not for kids AT All! Way too much info on every page. DVD stars a 70s throw back who talks to adults. No kids in video to teach kids. There are no kids songs in the book for kids to play. Absolutely the worst music purchase I have ever made.
5,To help toddlers and pre-schoolers to wait!!!,"I have read this book with the my twin boys (4 years) since I am in my second trimester. I think this book makes them asking question freely esp. that they feel that they are not alone in their feelings about their mom's pregnancy.It is nothing to do with baby at all. Just about ""waiting"" for him/her. May be this is the only negative point about it."
4,It was a gift,"Can't give it a 5. It was shipped in a envelope and the case was cracked. I guess it was my fault partially. I thought I was buying new and it was used in excellent condition. I just swapped it with a good CD case, but should not of had to. I'll read more carefully next time.Was a gift for my SIL as she plays mandolin and this had some good reviews."
4,Excellent elegant looking font,"Jasmine has beautiful calligraphy type letters very flowing and curvy. I absolutely could not do without this font. Although it's application is very distinct, when you need this look of elegance no other Cricut font (to date) will do. It is true you cannot cut 1/2 inch letters with this font. But it is well worth the investment when only this look will do for your project"
1,cancelled without explanation,"this was an item i needed by a certain date; i.e. my wedding. It was simply cancelled without explanation; no email, no call. There also does not seem to be any way of getting in touch with these people; you call the numbers on the web site and only get the run around. I would NOT recommend this vendor."
3,not a bad little gadget,"I had hoped that it would play a bit more of the song, but for the price, including 2, I got what I paid for. This is a great project item, I was very happy with it."
1,Plastic junk,"I thought I would give KLH a try based on several reviews that this company made good gear. This was a big disappointment. These speakers have nothing - they sound like tin cans. Now you could say you get what you pay for, but I honestly cannot find anything nice to say about them. They have no bass, the midrange is muddy - seems like a few octaves are simply missing, and the highs are loud, but not crisp. The subwoofer is somewhat decent, but its not really 50 watts. It is 25 watts RMS, 50 watt peak. RMS should be the only rating you look at, as it is a more standardized measure of power. I returned mine to the store"
2,For one time,The only good things about the movie are Sherlyn's in-your-face sexuality and Hitesh Kriplani's endearing performance as Lucky.The movie is probably for one time watch...
1,Not a well-written book,You have to be an idiot to keep reading this book. I couldn't get passed chapter 2 without thinking how juvenile this book sounds. There are better books out there. This is not one of them. Keep looking.
2,THE EGYPTIANS,LET'S START WITH THE FACT THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE NOT WHITE AND KEMET WAS THE NAME OF THE LAND BEFORE IT WAS CHANGED! DO A HISTORY SEARCH OF IT!!!!
4,Tonyboy,The product is ok. I bought it for my 30 pound cat who refuses to use it. However my much smaller cat likes it.----------------Could you find a smaller box? It came in a box large enough to fit a small refrigerator. Also it was wrapped in dozens of feet of brown paper? What a waste and what a pain to dispose of.
5,"Great, Comfy Bed!","I have purchased several of these for my Golden Retriever mix. She absolutely loves them! I have one in just about every room of the house! I even got one to put in her Midwest Bay Isle Crate. When she got her first one, she immediately went to it and laid down in it! She either curls up on one of the short ends or hangs her paw and head over one of the ""pillow-like"" sides. She looks so comfortable! I have read many reviews from people and vet offices, and people say that all dogs and cats love them! I will be getting one for our cat, too!"
3,It's ok...,"I bought this for my 50 pound dog. While it looks very plush in the picture, in real life it is simply mundane. It was inexpensive, but at the cost of it looking and feeling cheap. It is super thin and she might as well be laying on a blanket."
2,Bed is too thin!,This bed is super thin. The fleece came off in chunks and was everywhere in seconds. I purchased this because the reviews were great but this was returned the next day.
3,My dogs still don't like it,"I ordred this to replace large pillows: the pillows are harder to wash and the seams come undone. The dogs (2 border collies) love their big pillows, I thought I would give this pet fleece a try to see if I could get them to switch from their ratty pillows. Not yet. I try to get them to lie down on the pet fleece. Sure, I can force the issue, but they just sneak away as soon as they can to a favorite spot. Anywhere but the funny looking pet fleece, it seems.As for the product itself, the pet fleece is kind of thin on the bottom, not much cushioning. This is probably for other breeds of dog who like the little rise along the edges and don't need/want the soft cushion. My dogs are used to hay, and If it isn't soft like hay, it doesn't feel right to them.I wouldn't recommend the product and wouldn't buy it again, but I'll keep this one and hope that one of the dogs gets to like it ...someday."
3,Dog Bed,"This is made of a soft, plush fabric, though a bit thin, not much of a cushion for your dog's comfort. It would be good on the floor of a dog crate."
5,Excellent product and my dogs love it!,"Midwest products are excellent, all of my dog crates are by them and these Quiet Time pet beds are very soft and comfortable for my 2 schnauzers. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
4,"Shockingly comfortable, but not for chewers","I thought it was pretty flimsy when I pulled it out of the box. That very day, my dog had chewed off half of the bottom pan from his crate, leaving just a wiry bottom. I didn't want to make him lay down on those wires and, luckily, this arrived that day. I put it in and felt it with my hands. I couldn't feel the wires! It seems very comfortable for him to sleep on.He does have a level of separation anxiety though, so he chewed a good old hole through it while I was at the grocery and tore the sides. If your dog chews, you might want something else, but this is my interim bed for him until I find something that's more chew proof and comfortable."
2,Sheds A Lot,"Great value and huge size are big +++s. But we have it inside next to our bed and the thing sheds blue fuzz like crazy. Would be best outside or in a crate, not on your carpet or other flooring."
2,Messy,"This bed is OKAY. In hindsight, I would've paid $15.00 for it. Not a penny more. I am constantly having to vacuum because the fleece material falls off of the bed! My dog does not chew, so I know it's just the poor quality."
4,Decent replacement,"I purchased this bed to replace the one I bought with my pup's kennel a year ago. It doesn't fit perfectly, but it was clean and soft and my dog loved it... until she tore two holes in it the first day.Definitely not the product's fault, and a few pillow cases have prevented any similar destruction for a few weeks now.Quality product for the price, and I'd give it five stars if it was offered in a size that better fit my dog's kennel."
2,Shed fluff constantly!,"We bought this bed for our puppy to use inside a Midwest Crate. While the stitching and seams held up great to multiple washings and her chewing, after about the fourth wash it started to shed its fuzz. The constant clumps of fluff coming off of it were really annoying, but I could have dealt with it if the pup wasn't insistent on eating it all. No amount of my trying to get all the loose fluff off of it seemed to help, it just constantly shed. After only two months, we've decided to toss it. What a waste."
5,A great bed inside or outside of a crate!,"I originally ordered this bed to place inside of the Midwest Select Triple-Door Crate sold here on Amazon. When it arrived, I was shocked at the quality of the item. For the first day or two I just set it in the living room and let my puppy get accustomed to it, but it really only took 5 minutes for puppy to hop right in and lay down. The quality is fantastic and the inside padding appears to be lined with plastic, meaning it's not going to absorb any mistakes etc etc.I did end up tossing it into the Crate and the fit was perfect. Now my puppy doesn't mind jumping in the crate and laying down in comfort at all. This is a fantastic product and I would suggest it to anyone looking for a nice bed and/or crate bedding."
3,"Big, but not very plush","I only have two complaints about this bed...it SHEDS worse than our dog and it's not plush enough on the bottom. We have hardwood floors, so we had to add two blankets underneath the bed so it would be more comfie for her. I personally don't care for it. It sheds like crazy. I do like how it's built up around the sides though. She loves to lay her head on that."
5,My dogs love it!,"I bought a large version of this bed for my lab puppy, but my Pomeranian kept sleeping on it, so I bought him this one to sleep in. Well, the chihuahuas have taken this one over. Apparently it is very comfortable for big and small dogs alike. Nice product and I like that it is washable."
5,Really pleased,"Our dogs chew everything we put in their crates with them. We get through a lot of towels and plush bedding (stuffing everywhere). I ordered this and, so far, no chewing! Great! It's well made and they seem to really like it. We're very pleased with this item. I haven't washed it yet, so we'll see..."
4,Good purchase!,This was more than what I was expecting. The quality of the product is very good and is not flimsy at all. It is very soft and plush. Now if only I can get my husky to sleep on it imstead of under the bed!
4,Good investment for a big chewer!,"We've had this pet bed for over a year now and it's held up fairly well but it starting to show signs of wear. It's been a good bed for our dog and fits perfectly well in the 36"" dog crate that we use for our dog. This is a good dog bed that has been through a lot of wear but held up decently to a chewing dog."
5,Fits perfect,"We got a new dog and crate so this fit perfect. Our existing dog had the same size one that was worn out, so replaced that as well. Good price."
3,Size,"Topp produkt, and fast shiping.( Would like shiping to Europe from seller/ Amazone) It is to expensive to use Jetcarrier or simelar to ship.I ordered a Vari kennel, and it said:Frequently Bought Together. I then asumed that this would fit in crate. It was to large.Bjoern"
5,Fits the 42 kennel,I bought this because the dog I wanted to buy it for is this color. Plus I have another one for a different dog and knew that they were good. The only down side is that there isn't that much padding on the bottom. But my pit bull likes it. So it was worth it.
3,Not so comfy as you'll expect,"Pros:- Machine washable- fits perfect in the crate- Easy to move around and take placesCons- Is very flat, no cushion on the bottom, your pet will be literally on the floor (with a mat in between)Still I'm happy with the purchase. is not my dog's favorite, but it has worked perfectly for taking to training class and having him lay around the house.If you are looking some sort of bed for your pet, this is not the option"
4,Quiet time Bolster Ved,Perfect! just the right amount of cushion. I have a paralyzed daschund and he LOVES this! It give his great support and easy for him to get in & out of.
4,Nice & Large,"This item originally was suppose to fit in the crate I bought for my Pup, but it is waaay too large, I don't even know if there is a crate that big? Overall I am completely satisfied with the purchase. It was VERY inexpensive, I got free shipping & it is nice. Although I would like to find a -not so flat- bed for my Pup; Because he usually sleeps on a satin pillow that is cushionier then this. This is actually just a little flatter then i expected but for the price what do I expect. It's just that all the super nice cushy beds are up to $90? Don't ask me why... I am just happy to have found this one, later I can buy a smaller cushion that will fit inside this one I guess?"
1,Not a fan,"The sizes that are available are great, but the bed is like a big cotton pad. If your dog is at all mischievous like mine they will tear this thing apart.Even when my pup isn't trying fluff gets all over the house, when she wakes up in the morning there will be small balls of the bedding all over her feet and mouth. The bolster for the head rests are nice, but there is almost zero padding where they lay their bodies.If the bed did not shed so much, it would be great, but for me it is just 1 star."
3,very thin.,It's very thin. The pictures make it look more fluffy than it actually is. My bulldog doesn't complain so I guess dogs don't care too much However for the price I'd expect more fluff.
3,"Nice but size is off, they are atleast 2 inches short in length and width","I bought two of these, one for each dog, and they love them.judging by the way they chew on them. they are nice beds and I would have giving 5 stars but the size on both was off by several inches and I ordered then to fit their crates and that a sizable gap around the crates so GO BIG, order a sze up."
4,Very good,Dogs like it. I wish it were a little thicker padding (but then I wish it were free and I was Queen). I think it is very good for the money.
2,Fleece version sheds big clumps of fuzz.,"I really wanted to like this bed -- it's soft, attractive, and the perfect size for our 30"" Midwest crate. However, from the very start, it shed big clumps of fuzz which my puppy would then try and play with and eat. I tried washing it, thinking that this might help with the shedding problem. I even tried kind of ""combing"" some of the fuzz out with my finger tips to get rid of it, but it just kept shedding fleece -- from nickel-sized balls of it up to half-dollar sized ones! After finding the fuzz in my puppy's mouth a couple of times, I decided to return mine."
4,Dog gone good,"I purchased this dog bed a couple weeks ago, before I even got it outa the box my black lab german short hair cross was tring to lay on it, so yes its a good product if she likes it. The only buff so far is I see it leaves some fuzz balls on the floor, oh well."
3,It was okay,The bed was really long. Not what I anticipated but the product is functional. This product is very susceptible to dirt and dust so I would recommend that it should be washed frequently or replaced for short term use.
5,"fits in 32"" Petmate crate","I bought the 30"" x 21"" for my 32"" Petmate crate and it fits great. I was a little concerned about the way the bolster around the edge makes the flat surface significantly smaller inside the crate but since our dog likes to rest her head on the bolster right up against the door it's not an issue. Washed on gentle and dried on low before use, looks fine."
3,"Thin, but fits!",I bought this to fit in a medium lifestages midwest kennel. It fits perfect. My one complaint is that the bottom is very thin. I folded up a polar fleece blanket and put it underneath so it felt more like a bed and less like a towel weight.
1,very poor quality,this bed lasted one week. the quality was unacceptable. very flimsy and thin. my dog pawed at it and it is now in the garbage (with a huge hole in it). i was not expecting this to last forever but at least more than a week. i want my money back.
1,Does not hold up,"Yes, this bed is a good price. It can be washed at home. It does not hold up well at all. It pills up and gets all over the carpet. I would not recommend."
3,its cool,"The fabric is pretty nice, but the middle is a bit to thin so i add a blanket for extra support for my dog, other than that my dog loves it"
4,"Easy, washable, dog eats it","This is easy to use and washable. The dog has figured out the sides are like a stuffed toy and has started to chew the sides and removed the filling. But for the price, it's a great deal since you can wash over and over without damaging the bed. The bottom is very thin, so don't expect this to give your dog much padding."
5,Fits Great in the Crate,"I bought this bed to fit in the Midwest Life Stages 36""x24""x27"" crate. It fits perfectly, even with the divider in place. The bottom of the bed has nylon backing, so if an accident should occur, you've got a little time before your floors are at risk.Midwest Life-Stages 36-by-24-by-27-Inch Single-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate"
5,Great Versatile Pet Bed,"I own three of these pet beds. One large one for my dog and two small ones for my cats. All 3 critters absolutely love them. They feel nice and the roll around the edge allows them to feel like they are curled up against a corner. They always back up into a corner of the roll and settle there. The padding on the bottom of the bed is decent. Not super plush, but enough that even on the hard kitchen floor it feels quite soft.I also love the beds because they are easy to wash. When I first got my dog she had an accident on her bed, and I just threw it in the washing machine, then in the dryer, and it came out looking brand new. For the cats, I'll usually use a lint roller on the beds to collect the hair before throwing in the wash. On that note - the beds do a great job of trapping hair. More hair on the pet bed means less hair on my furniture :) Definitely recommend these beds."
5,My dog loves it!,"My dog likes the bed and although is big for him, he likes to lay on it all the time. Easy to wash. Great Price!"
3,"decent, inexpensive dog beds","I have 2 of these large bolster beds for our dog crates. Pros, they have a nice thick bolster and fit perfectly inside the crates. The quality of the beds seems high and they feel pretty sturdy. The con is that it has virtually no padding in the middle area. We have a couple of older dogs who I feel could benefit from more cushion. I was able to find some memory foam cushions that fit right into the center spot and are still low enough to take advantage of the bolster. I do recommend this bed (I bought a second after I got the first one so obviously I felt it was worth the cost) just know that you might need or want a middle cushion."
1,World's Best Bridge,I cannot install this software because my OS is Windows 78 64 bit. The technology is antiquated on this product
1,Navigationally challenged,The errors and omissions in this book would make anyone navigationally challenged.
5,An Awesome Book!,"I loved this book is about vampires, witches and the combinations of vampire/witches. This book was something I just couldn't put down. I wanted to read it again and again just to catch the nuances that I missed the first time. This story delves into the mental/physical/emotional dilemmas of a woman (Kye) that does not want to give the same fate that was forced upon her to others. Her resolve to keep away from the man she loves is because she loves him and knows the consequences of the life she leads. Because of that resolve she does not take into consideration the wants and needs of Jade, the man that loves her. She is trapped in her own loneliness and is willing to sacrifice her own happiness for the normal life of another. She tries to do the right thing despite herself. I can say enough positive things about this book. I hope that there will be a sequel. I would like to know more about her witch side the next time around."
2,The Devil Is In the Detail,"This novel will have limited appeal except to ardent bibliophiles, and even they may be bored to tears with the details. This book is closer to a textbook than a novel. There's plenty of excellent 17th century background, but the plot is too complicated, the characters undeveloped and the finale incredible. I'm amazed I hung in there and finished Ex-Libris."
2,Confusing and Disappointing,"King's narrative was bogged down with unnecessary details, historical conspiracies, name dropping and dead-end plot-lines in which a seventeenth century book-seller is given the task of tracking down a mysterious volume. I was pretty disappointed in the conclusion and the anticlimactic revelation of the purpose of the sought book. I had really been looking forward to reading Ex-Libris and I really wanted to like it (being such a bibliophile and having a soft-spot for books about books) but it was far too scattered and inconsistent."
3,At least it managed to catch my attention,"This reminds me of those mystery stories having endings that spill out everything leaving you mildly insulted and exasperated. You'll start asking yourself why you bothered to plough through those chapters that go on and on about the history of events, people and things.But a clever ploy; style seems to rule over substance here."
1,Northwest Territory stove ($11 at K-mart) is much better,"I have used this Coleman stove for years. It does not let you adjust the flame low enough to simmer a pot (after it boils) with the lid on.You are forced to take the lid off and waste fuel, because the regulator works only in discrete steps.Recently I bought the Northwest Territory propane stove available at K-mart for only $11.It is much better, since you can regulate the flow smoothly, and can adjust the flame as low as you want. Once a pot boils, you can simmer with the lid on and save fuel.It is smaller at the top than the Coleman, but I have not found this to be a problem. Even large pots remain stable, if centered properly.I am extremely happy, and will never go back to Coleman."
5,Best For Backpacking,Coleman makes the best camping gear and this stove attachment is perfect for backpacking. Its lightweight and is wide enough (8 inches) to steadily hold any pot or pan. The regulator can be turned down very low and still not be blown out by wind. Easily attaches to Coleman propane containers and has a nice canister base that is also steady. You really don't need more than one of these for two campers. Cleans easily as well.
5,A great little camp stove with other uses.,"In the wake of Hurricane Irene, we lost power for several days. On top of that, our water company notified us that we must boil our drinking water for several days. This was a perfect way to boil pots of water and not heat up the house as well. In my opinion, it is a great little camp stove."
4,Good product.,"I like the simplicity of the design and the light weight.The 8 inch top is big enough to hold big cookware.You need to bring your own ligher to light the fire (not a big deal).I give it 4-start, not because of any defact from this product, but because Amazon's price is too high. WalMart sells this for only $19.96 :-)"
3,"High, Higher, and BLAST FURNACE.","The good news is this thing puts out a lot of heat. It will boil water faster for coffee than my power burner on my kitchen stove. It's heavy, tough, nicely chromed and finished and seems like a good value for the money.So why the three stars? Well, it's the heat. You can't turn it down. The lowest setting is blasting enough to burn any kind of food you might be trying to cook, and the burner simply goes out below that. If you're just making coffee, this is like a jet engine. If you really need to cook something, it has some problems."
5,J M,"My wife bought this for me a few years ago as a fun gift, and now it is the only thing she will let me wear. She loves it. It is light and smells great."
4,So far so good,"I did use Scott's products in this spreader and it worked fine. I have a 6,000 sq foot lot that is very bumpy with plenty of holes and the spreader just went right over them. I cannot speak to the longevity of it as this is my first season with it but assembly was very easy, done in minutes, and it is as sturdy as plastic can be. I just think it is a bit overpriced for what it is."
1,Scotts Basic/Standard Spreader Sucks,"Bought the spreader now called the (standard Model) for $ 26. Worked fine on Fescue grass but then locked up when I used it on Zoysia grass. Wheels an axle locked up. This spreader should be used by those who ONLY have a level lawn, less then 10,000 sq feet and only use Scott products (fine particles ) in it. Anything otherthen the Scott sized particle may not work in this unit because of its design. My lawn guy told me to get an Earthway push or a John Deere that I can hook up to my ZTR. Now I must get hitch bracket for Zero Turn Mower. I cut 1.5 acres of grass. The Earthway and John Deere models all cost major $$$. He sys that is because they last. Lesson learned."
5,The book was great!,The book really helped me get ready for some big changes in my life. It helped me get ready for school and become change resilient. I let a teacher borrow it and he loved it. Its a great book for anyone. I highly recommend it.
5,Highly recommended for the beginner!,"If you're struggling to learn how to read music like me, this is sure to help!"
3,B-,"If you are looking for an authoritative book for ethnic rhinoplasty, look elsewhere. Nice read and on the plus side, I am sure you will take home some points. The author presents his somewhat rigid approach to techniques employed for ethnic noses. Photographs are terribly unprofessional. No operative drawings. No long term follow up results. Main emphasis on black noses. Middleeastern and oriental noses dont even get a mention."
3,Gum..,"It's gum, nothing super special. The boxes are super tiny..I just thought I would get something different to put in some Halloween bags for my neighbors kids for halloween."
4,A Powerful Story,"A thoroughly gripping account of the 1979 Fastnet ocean race in the Western Approaches off the coasts of Ireland and England. Some sailors called it a freak storm, others said anyone taking a sailboat to sea should always expect the unexpected. The author does a brilliant job of describing what a violent force the wind and waves can be, not just to the boats that happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, but also to the men and women that brave the ocean in the spirit of competition."
1,Don't Buy Panasonic DVD-RP62 Model,"I purchased the DVD-RP62 DVD player because of the company's reputation for quality. After ten months of minimal use, the DVD player became stuck on the ""stop"" position, with no means to go into the ""play"" mode. The indication ""HO7"" appeared on the screen. From numerous other reviews on Amazon, I have found out that this is a common problem relating to the drive motor. The Panasonic instruction book and website was not helpful. I am very disapointed and will not purchase any additional Panasonic products."
2,broken panasonic,owned this unit for 10 months. great until it broke. seems like a lot of owners have the same problem and error code. guess i'll try a toshiba next.
1,HO7 Error reading,"My worked great for a little over a year, then I got an H07 error. I will definetely NOT be buying another panosonic DVD player.Lorrie, Virginia"
4,a great payer with one small problem,"After trying out several different brands I finally settled on Panasonic DVD-RP62S. This is a great player with all the features that you might possibly need and the performance is superb. I won't say any more than that as other reviewer have heaped enough praise on it already.BUT, guys, could you make the buttons on the remote any smaller?! I mean you need a microscope to see them! And I'm talking about the buttons that get used a lot, like STOP,PLAY,PAUSE etc. This just drove me so nuts that I was going to return the player. Thankfully, my TV remote has friendly large buttons and I'm using it to control most DVD playback functions.I've checked out some other Panasonic models and several of them have the same remote with the same tiny buttons. I just can't understand why it is done this way. None of the other DVD brands have this problem."
2,H07 error-me too!,"Yes, my Panasonic DVD player just died today (3/9/06) after a long and illustrious life of 1 1/2 years. I would not call that durable. It did well while it worked, but it's gone now!"
4,The most over produced G-Love album ever...,"One of the many joys I find of listening to G. Love's music is it's raw sounding recording. Although some find this irritating, I think it only adds to the general ambience of his music. As a long time fan of G.Love and The Special Sauce I bought this album last of all, having overlooked it somehow. Compared to other offerings, Yeah, It's That Easy et al this is probably my least favourite album by them. Having said that it is only weak compared to other g.love offerings and as I said I'm a big fan. If you can get over the ridiculously crisp recording, then this is another quality showcase of G.Love's blues/hip hop style..."
4,this ain't no backstreet boys,i bought this album blindly. i had only heard G Love's 1st album and was happy with the purchase of this one. songs cover a nice range and there is a solid groove thru out the album. overall i was impressed that these guys are still around and trying to make some original music.
5,"g love, my main man","all i have to say is go out and get this cd. you will not, i repeat NOT be dissapointed. i enjoy ""Night of the living dead"" and ""parasite"".....hell all the tracks are lovely. :) i PROMISE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Boring...,"An intelligent, well-written, well thought-out bore. It took me over a week to finish this book, and when I was done I wondered why I even bothered."
2,A bit of a snoozer,"I'm finding Darnton a hit-or-miss author. Neanderthal was an interesting premise, but trite characters. Really enjoyed The Experiment. The Darwin Conspiracy had a lot of promise, but turned out to be a very complicated presentation of a very simple and uninteresting mystery. Boring."
1,Super Advice,"A quote from the book:""For enormous, inoperable tumors, say, 'I AM the Presence healing this tumor.' Repeat this Affirmation 933 times. This will do absolutely nothing to your tumor--but repeating words for hours on end will provide a slight distraction in the midst of your dying process."""
1,"Hands-down, one of the worst...","iLumina is about as close to a rip-off as can legally be had. Shortly before its debut, it was promised to the public that a significant portion of the Bible would be animated. Not so, and there has been no addition to the barely handfull of existing animations in well over 2 years.The user interface is extremely unfriendly and has several bugs. It takes too long to load, is too slow, and in some cases requires you to modify your computer's settings to properly view animations.iLumina's website promises that more animations and features are on the way - but nothing has ever been done, with the exception of a new ""edition"" coming out every year or so. Inquiries sent to iLumina regarding updates have never been responded to.Since slapping down over $80 for the iLumina Gold package, I have discovered E-Sword, a FREE Bible study software that is feature and content rich, far superior to iLumina."
5,yoga novice,I am very pleased with the wide variety of positions in this book. Im enjoying trying them. The book was delivered in a timely manner and is in good condition.it is a wonderful supplement to the classes i take at the gym
5,Great yoga guide,"This is one of the first yoga books I got when I began my yoga practice aproximately 5 years ago. I actually bought this particular book as a graduation gift for one of my yoga students. It is a wonderful, basic guide for beginners or experienced practioners of yoga."
3,BEWARE: Hidden Ingredients Include Soybean Oil and MSG,"I took a chance on this mayonnaise, hoping that it would not contain soy oil --- because the ingredients are not listed in the description of this product. So much to my dismay, I found out after the mayonnaise arrived that it does indeed contain soy oil --- and worse, it contains MSG.The product may, in fact, be wonderful for some people. But you should be aware that this product contains soybean oil and MSG --- which some people, cannot tolerate for medical reasons.Downgraded to three stars for hiding the ingredients.The ingredients only show up on the cello wrapper and do not appear on the plastic container itself. So here is a the list of the ingredients so thoughtful buyers can make an intelligent decision without guessing or having to take a chance:***** Ingredients: Vegetable Oil (Canola Oil, Soybean Oil), Egg Yolk, Vinegar, Salt, Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), Spice, Natural Flavor, Contains Egg. *****"
3,The last of the 1080i's with some drawbacks,"This actually is a nice looking TV (while bulky) the picture quality and sound are great and it IS 1080i compatible (no way to get 1080p although I doubt the difference is that great). However this set is not HDMI compatible. It is not even DVI compatible so you can't get a DVI - HDMI converter. You are stuck with component cables which are not as good as HDMI (again, I am not sure how noticeable the difference is). So to summarize, this TV is good, but not the best."
2,Much Ado About Nothing fails ...,"This performance was a disappointment on many levels: vapidly hyperbolic, stale stereotyping in staging and acting. Performance/staging were wearisome and actors lines often garbled - felt uninspired, outdated, corny rather than spirited."
3,???,"I'm not sure I precisely understood this film, possibly becausemajor aspects of the plot are never fully explained. The actingis tedious and confusing. Also, the colorized version is terrible. Stick with black and white."
3,One or two pages on everything,"One or two pages on everything, better write a book on each chapter with tradestation implementation code. Foot notes with outdated book refernce used, I didn't suggest buying these books or buying this book to get foot notes."
3,Nice thriller,"Gerard Butler rarely fails to deliver, and he did a great job in this movie. You wonder how it all will come to be and the story makes it plausible, not corny."
5,a truly moving film,"this movie made me want to go to Africa and help people, to get up and do something. it is a movie that will undoubtedly move you, its unapologetic honesty of the horrors that occur in Africa will open your eyes. i got teary eyed at least five times. an absolute must see."
1,Don't wast your money,"If you are looking to pass the time and have extra money you'd like to waste buy this book otherwise don't bother. I read it wondering if it would ever get better . . . it did not. This is a short, not very well written, depressing story with far too much is left unsaid."
3,Looks can be deceiving...Well colors that is.,"So I ordered Taupe for our nursery, which turned out to actually be beige and is quite a bit lighter than shown in views of it. It has no gray tone what so ever, really it's beige and a little blah for me. So I'm a little disappointing since the color is off, but the curtains themselves seem nice."
5,A Great game,"This game is great for the whole family. It's easy enough for my 5 yr old, but challenging enough for Mom and Dad. We love racing against each other. A must have for Hot Wheel fans."
3,worth every peny,the game disc came with the bluck buster seal writing in marker the bottum had scratches didnt come as promised like new it was more used acceptable at a fair price not worth returning but dont expect a like new condition because after all they are old games im lucky mines works
1,Same Power Problem,"I have the same power problem. Expereinced it a couple of times over the past six years of owning this TV, but alway's solved by unplugging the TV, replugging then turning on again. Now, no luck. I am really tired of the failure rates of TVs these days ... We are paying thousands more and getting half the life of the older TVs."
4,sandra is awesome,"sandra's music is very good. she has one of the best female voices and i have been listening to her since i was 13 yrs old. she has incredible talent and m. cretu produces great music with her! try it out, you'll like it!"
3,The Stabat Mater performance is wanting....,"While I have enjoyed David Daniels' previous works like the Handel operatic arias and his lieder album Serenade, I can't say the same for this Vivaldi release. Having owned Andreas Scholl's Harmonia Mundi recording of the Stabat Mater for several years (and dozens of listening, literally), Daniels' interpretation falls horribly flat to my ear. His voice is not as ethereal or light in the ""female"" register as you'd expect from a countertenor. His voice is indeed too heavy and unfocused, especially if you're familiar with Scholl's clarity and soaring high notes. The Nisi Dominus and Longe Mala are worthy performances, but I have to give this 3 stars not 4 or 5. If you're looking for the most ""authentic"" countertenor performance of the Stabat Mater, seek out Andreas Scholl's which features two other cantatas as well."
2,"Well, the flag is right this time...","Interesting concepts - to put together books on global colors (see: ""Global Graphics: Color"") and symbolism for the field of graphic design. This information is needed in this world of global messaging. After having my doubts confirmed on false data in the color book, however, red flags still want to wave in my brain with this book. At least the German flag is displayed correctly in the ""Symbols"" book. And both books are well designed and great eye candy. ""Symbols"" also gives various avenues for creative thinking. I would be careful with their facts, however. Check them twice or three times with other sources just to be on the safe side."
4,Entertaining and prompt,The DVD's arrived quickly and both shows were just as much fun to watch as the first time I saw them.
2,Not recommended for beginners,"I found this book to be unnecessarily confusing, at least for a beginner. Perhaps part of the problem is that better raw materials have become available since this book was published. It is also poorly written, with incomplete sentences and strange syntax. It would have benefited from a good editor. The examples (in photos) are quite bizarre, but even if you are inspired, there are no explanations of how the result was achieved. The nicest example is on the cover, in my view. I also bought Sherri Haab's book, The Art of Resin Jewelry, and recommend it."
4,Tight S&W Ranger belt,Really nice belt for the price. The belt is however just a little snug. I would recommend ordering one size larger than your waist size.
1,BAD Delivery,"I ordered this DVD on January 14 - The order was not entered until January 18th! And, I was not notified of any order until January 19th. I am told, I cannot expect delivery until NEXT WEEK! Totally unacceptable! Do not use this company."
1,Who designed this a five year old?,"Ok im a fan of the WWE but whoever came up with this at the box art is f##king stupid. First off why spoil three of the main matches that night? Did they ask a five year old and he went ''ok lets put all the champions on the cover'',Because i can't honestly see an sensible adult coming up with this design.Its the same a se7en writing in big letters his wife's head is in the box or darth vader is luke's father on the cover of The Empire Strikes Back case. Of course a wwe PPV is not on the scale of a hollywood movie but you get the point. Why spoil it for the fans?Aside from the spoiler ,the cover looks a bit amateurish and lookslike no effort has been put into it. I know many people could come up with something 10 times better.Needless to say i won't be buying it. Vince fire whoever came up with this joke of a DVD cover."
5,Title correction,Title is spelt wrong. It must be amazon's fault. Great book as well as those who recommend it : )
4,Great little TV for the money!,"Purchased this little gem for an exercise room in my basement. Decent picture and sound quality. Workmanship seems to be above par for a TV in this price range. Excellent documentation. Comes with cheap little over-the-air antenna that you probably won't use. Due to all the noise from the fitness equipment, I often have to turn up the volume to hear the TV- I have noticed little or no distortion when the volume is turned up. You'll probably want to tweak the factory default picture settings- I found the contrast setting was really not to my liking. Easy to use on screen navigation controls for adjusting TV settings. Comes with nice little remote."
4,The Product works well,"Before I purchased this product did some research on the ingredients: ""Chromium Picolinate"" in Google and found lot of good articles. After being convinced, started using for the last 2 weeks and feel that the Sugar levels are under control."
5,Good Job,"The item arrived as promised. I was notified when item was shipped. I was kept informed as to all aspects of the sale as far as when they received the order, when the order was processed, when order was shipped and when I could expect the shipment. I would order from them again with no second thoughts. It is nice to place an order and have no problems what so ever. Good Job !!"
2,Tasted a bit artificial and too pungent.,"Didn't taste at all natural like a real key lime pie. I recommend that you skip this flavor of this product and instead try the lemon and strawberry flavors, which are much better. They have a more natural taste. On the positive side, this product is sugar free, low in calories and easy to make. In general this company's products are very good. It is just this particular flavor of the product that is lacking."
3,The Artist,"This movie was creative in concept, but the ""silent treatment"" didn't work for me. I am rather surprised it won the best picture oscar last year. I would recommend this picture only to college film majors.The lack of audible dialogue made this movie very tedious."
3,"OK Plot, Should have had sound.","There is a reason movies have sound these days-because people are capable of speech. This might have gone over really well amongst the eclectic film professionals or at Galudet college, but not for mainstream America."
4,Charmant,"It turns out THE ARTIST is as charming as it's been made out to be, with no small credit due Jean Dujardin and his lovely co-star, Berenice Bejo. Dujardin's good humor lights up the screen in a hard-sell concept that he carries with ease. There's plenty of wit and warmth, and the finale is definitely worth waiting for."
5,Silent Film Valentine,"Yes the film is ni 4:3 aspect ratio, black and white, and contains no spoken dialogue. But there is planty of music (including a nod to Vertigo) and so much charm. It seems strange that some viewers are not able to appreciate this unconventionally presented but quite comprehensible story of devotion, loyalty, and perserverance. The perfprmances are all excellent and the black and the cinematography outstanding. There is genuine joy in this film, especially with the two leading characters. The dog and the excellent character actors also add a moral dimension that is not too serious but enlarges the emotions. Highly recommended."
3,Just OK,"My wife and I streamed this movie with great anticipation. After all, it won best picture so it had to be great, right? Wrong. Yes, it was interesting and creative, and certainly something we haven't seen in a modern-day movie before. But it was also boring, depressing, and felt like something a UCLA film student could have created. Best Picture candidate - no. Best Picture winner - no way. Would I watch it again - not a chance. And that is the measure of a great movie, will it stand the test of time and be watched again and again. This movie will be forgotten in a year. You'll see it in the Walmart $5 bin next year. Disappointed!"
1,My Guests and I Were Very Much Disappointed,"This film is what I would call a novelty piece if you want to experience seeing what an olde time silent film was like. It would have made a great short film. Ten minutes of this rental and my guests and I wanted it turned OFF immediately.Sure it's cute and creative and I respect all of the artists involved, but this was not my cup of tea!!!I'm not the only one who feels cheated out of the cost of viewing this film - The film's marketing team did a great job at deceiving people. I actually thought that my high-tech A/V system had an audio malfunction."
3,Its got its great moments,"JT Money from the poison clan has the kind of voice that hooks you...hearing hilo on the radio and bet made me wanna hear more...there are some really good songs on here....like war, superbitch, and hi-lo......and there are alot of filler songs that arent saying much.....and that is the problem...his lyrics are kind of lacking but he makes up for it in delivery...so get the cd but be careful....."
5,A sparkling debut!,"Her first release and she is annointed! The rousing ""I know i've been changed"" is a knock-down drag-out accapella landscape. If your soul doesn't feel something during this song, then you never will. It is worth the price of the cd.............But then there is more.""Oh, How i love jesus"" starts out as a simple ballad. Towards the end it gets to tugging at your heart and has you giving thanks to jesus as you realize what hes done for you. At the end the spirit catches Lashun and she goes from one octave to another. This is sunday morning sangin' and it doesnt get any better than that. Tears come to your eyes as she wails ""The devil is a liar! I love you jesus!""It will be alright"" is a powerful uplifting and upbeat tune with gets your hands clappin and toes a tappin'. This cd is a winner and just the beggining of her great collection. Thank you God, and Thank you LASHUN. AMEN!"
5,Lubricants,"This is one of the best, most natural feeling, and long lasting lubricants.Cleans up easily and really enhances sex. I am a 50 year old female and have tried a number of products, but this is the best. My husband loves it, too."
4,Nice holster,"The other reviews must have received the wrong holster or they couldn't figure it out. I admit it took me a few minutes to figure out the way the phone actually clips into the holster to stay in place.One would THINK the phone would go into the holster upright with the screen not exposed, but that's not how it works. There's 2 little clip holes in the bottom edge of the phone which clip into the top of the holster.It works just fine!"
5,long time Vermonter,"Living in Vermont, In the same enviornment as Citro's setting, it is difficult to look accross the field from my kitchen window and not think of the Gentry. Leads you to question the foundation of your own reality"
5,Much more than a game,"The ""great game"" or the ""international pastime"" football (or soccer) can be called many things; however, until now it couldn't be called a theory on globilization. In Franklin Foer's How Soccer Explains the Worl, Foer takes a journy across the world to better understand why the ""great game"" is so great. This is the perfect time to discover the world's infatuation with soccer, more so now because of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Foer's travelogue is packed with intensely captivating dialogue as he attempts to infiltrate a world few AMerican's have seen. If you would like to be taken to stadiums in England, Ireland, Scotland, Croatia, Austria, or even Iran, to learn about the secrets of the world's sport, then How SOccer Explains the World is a 21st century odyssey waiting to open the reader's eyes onto a culture: soccer."
5,A Great Read...,"what a great read this is, i have recommended this book to everyone, it is more about the cultures and societies that soccer had a hand in shaping then it is actually about the game itself. its a wonder why so many americans have a hard time appreciatiing soccer (the last chapter gives a good reason why)This book was a perfect mix, of everything, sport, globalization, humor, passion, everything totally worth it, its a fairly quick and easy read. one of my new all time favorite books."
5,Soccer does indeed explain the world in many ways,"A superb book that cuts across cultures to explain the inside out outlook of may of the world's key areas and countries. Much like a well hooked corner kick to center net, this book takes into consideration all of the faactors that go into the modern business, passion and competition of football (soccer).It is NOT just another sports book. In fact, read as a partner to Samuel Huntington's Clash of civilizations, you might be surprised at the many parallel observations between high brow intellectual writing (Huntington) and direct analysis writing (Foer).Lastly, as I have lived and traveled over most of the world, and played soccer in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America, I can confirm almost all of the observations and conclusions that Foer draws. Truly a superb book that should be read and savored slowly (besides, they always show the good plays on instant replay, anyways)."
4,The book I wish I had written!,"This is a work based on an interesting concept and complemented by well-researched journalism, with the exception of a few overt inaccuracies such as this one: ""Celebrations for Romania's 1990 World Cup qualification carried over into the Bucharest squares, culminating in a firing squad that trained its rifles on the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife."" (Trust me! I was physically present at the above-mentioned 1989 soccer celebrations, and there was no political component to that happy event whatsoever!). Nevertheless, this is an excellent book and a truly entertaining read for the fans of The Beautiful Game and the novice alike. I recommend it wholeheartedly!"
5,The Bible of soccer,"This is THE BIBLE of high-brow soccer books (well it and Soccer Against the Enemy). Intellectual but entertaining, even if you don't care about soccer you will learn so much from this book about how the world really works. Everyone going abroad should read this book, and everyone (like me) from a country discussed in it would agree. It's perfect, although it might not be the easiest read for younger fans of the game."
3,Good fun and informitive,While this book doesn't form any theory of globalization as the title leads you to believe it is still a good read for a football fan (soccer for us poor americans). I learned alot about clubs that ive been following for years. The book reads more like a history book with sections on different clubs than a book that builds to a theoretcal conclusion. Its a good read for Sports fans but not such a gem if you are soley interested in globalization.
2,"Title Promising, Contents Letdown","This book begins with much promise, but is let down by the contents. More like a personal narrative of how individual parties in various countries live with soccer as a backdrop to what they do, the book does not answer the question posed in the title as much. While readers' interest may be raised with this rather creative title, Foer fails to deliver as much. I suppose the more accurate title would be: ""How Soccer Influences"" rather than explains the 10 different cultures mentioned in the book.The best part of the book is the way Foer deals with the counter-cultural role Soccer plays in American culture. That I feel is the strongest part of the book. In a sense, while the other 9 are pro-soccer, the USA projects itself as anti-soccer. If soccer is a synonym for globalization, the USA will make an interesting case study because it is the stronghold of globalization.conrade"
4,A double feature well woth the price of admission.,"Mercury Rising is great in all regards: performance, story development, pace, photography, plot. Everything fits into place as the story unfolds. It is also moving, especially at the end, somethings that not all action movies are or dream to be. Highly recommended.As for The Jackal, it is still quite nice, with firm direction, but with a feeling of ""déja vu"" in it. If one can pass through the estereotypes calmly, it is very entertaining."
2,"Outdated, Early Revisionist Work","This book is less about who wrote the Bible and more of a glimpse into 19th century revisionism. Originally published in the late 1800's, Gladden discusses much of the then-current scholarship regarding Biblical authors and canonical development. However, given the time period in which the book was written, the book skews hard towards the revisionist school of thought, which usually denies the traditional views of authorship. There has been much scholarly work done in the 100+ years since this book's publication that refute many of the author's arguments. Instead of this book, I recommend interested readers to pick up ""Who Really Wrote the Bible"" by Clayton Howard Ford. This book should be taken only for what it is: an outdated revisionist work, representative only of the ideas of its time."
4,The one-mantle Coleman lantern works fine. Good product.,Not much to say about a lantern. It's easy to use and it's reliable.
1,Lasted a couple months,"90 day warranty. I guess that they know something about the product, which Coleman offered to repair for $35! Thanks but no. I bought an electric replacement (not Coleman).Don't leave it out in the elements. Probably that's what when wrong with mine. Indoor camping anyone?"
3,nimble fingers,"Attaching the mantle is not an easy job.The holes in the mantle are small and are closedwith thread.You have to spread the mantle open, slip it onand then it gets caught up in the hardware.I had to use a small pair of pliers to pull the mantledown over the burner rod.For me, it was a pain in butt.My model is not the pizio ignition model yet the wiresfor it are under the globe and are another obstacle for themantle installation.Nimble fingers would be helpful."
2,mantle installation,"This should come with 2 mantles, so after you tear the first, you can try again.Very difficult for my big fingers to place this tube-like mantle over the top of the rough stamping of the burner without compromising the mantle.I've put a few mantles on lanterns before and they were easy compared to this setup, buy extra mantles."
4,Good case,I like this case and use it for my Bogen 3180n tripod. It has enough space for my tripod to completely fit inside without gymnastics - as my tripod's head is affixed to the stand. Plus you don't have to unzip it on the side to get the tripod in as it has a large end cap and the tripod just slips in from the end...a nice feature. My only complaint is that it doesn't have any zipped pockets for misc. items.
2,H07 error,"Yes, I recently got the H07 error code too, after almost 2 years. I recently bought a Sony and is much happier with it in term of remote/easy of use/able to read many dvd formats..."
2,Get something else,"Good:- This has a great picture and a reasonable price.Bad:- It worked for about 6 months, but now refuses to recognize any disk. (It shows an ""H06"" error) We haven't braved the warranty return yet.- The remote control is very badly designed."
2,Great player until it dies,"I had this player for about 2 1/2 years. I don't watch many movies, so it probably got used 2 or 3 times a month. The picture quality is great. It was a pretty nice dvd player. It wasn't as good for CDs, lacking features you'd want in a cd player, but it was ok. It died with the H07 error everyone else is reporting. I thought I would try and fix it with some WD40 like I've seen posted on the web. I tried to open it up and apparently the screws have been glued in or something, and simply will not come out. So I stomped on it a few times, and hit it with a hammer several times. Never managed to open it, it's a pretty rugged case. But I'm pretty sure it's dead now. It makes rattling noises when I pick it up and shake it, and has lots of dents. Oh well, I think my next one won't be a panasonic, since it seems alot of them have this problem"
1,Beware: Search Web For H07 and Panasonic,"I was happy with this DVD player for the 4 months I owned it before it stopped working. It started displaying H07 whenever I tried to play a DVD. I called Panasonic, who refused to tell me what the code meant, and they said to I needed to ship it to their repair facility and it would cost $85 to fix. It has a 1 year parts warranty, but only 90 days labor. If you search the internet for Panasonic DVD and H07, you will find that there are an astronomical number of consumers who have had thier Panasonic DVD players fail with-in months of purchase. Even though I was polite and friendly, the Panasonic service calls were at best answered by people who were pointedly unsympathetic, to outright rude. I shall never purchase another Panasonic product again. SEARCH THE NET BEFORE EVEN THINKING OF BUYING PANASONIC!"
2,"Nice picture, but lacks CD Functions and usability","After trying the unit, I am returning it. I agree with the other reviews about the manual being poor, but my complaint is with the CD functions. Through my system, CD's sounded bright and harsh compared to my standard CD player. This unit also will not let you randomly play songs on multiple CD's. It will shuffle the songs on a single CD, but not shuffle between CD's.The video looked great, and the remote was not as bad as others have claimed. If you just want video, it is a fine unit....if you plan on using for audio CD's as well, I would look elsewhere."
1,$150 paperweight,"Like many others, mine stopped working just out of warranty with an H07 code. Kind of ironic, since the whole point of paying extra for a Panasonic was to avoid this sort of thing. What a piece of rubbish. Everyone please spread the word so we can bring Panny's rep down to where it belongs--somewhere way below Apex & Phillips."
5,Good wood,I received the dowels and was extremely satisfied with the quality. We made fishing lures and the quality must be perfect. Thanks for a good product.
3,Not worth the bother,"First a caution: Read the technical specs before you buy! This game requires a specific chip set and WILL NOT RUN without it, a surprisingly advanced requirement for such a low-level game. Check out the technical requirements before you buy!That being said, don't bother to upgrade your machine to play this game -- it's not really worth it. Gameplay consists of pixel-hunting, running through a set list of questions, and random combinations of inventory items. The plot, such as it is, is confusing and illogical, though the acting is decent. Each chapter ends with a mandatory quiz that's annoyingly difficult; it mainly provides a reason to give up and go play something else.Would like to see more by these writers, with perhaps a smoother interface and a better plot."
1,I fell asleep at the end...seriously!,"It took me about a week to get through this and there were two defining moments in this time that can sum up this game.1. I almost threw my laptop across the room during the last timed scene because the mouse pointer wouldn't register where to go.2. When I finally got to the end, I started to watch the movie and he talked and talked and talked and then I felt my eyes get heavy and I FELL ASLEEP! I woke up about 2 minutes later and what was he doing... STILL TALKING!! I hit the escape key and quit the game.If you have trouble sleeping - THIS GAMES FOR YOU! If you have anger management issues, STAY AWAY!"
3,Beyond Hello,"Beyond ""Hello"" is a good introductory book for anyone responsible for answering phones in a client based industry. Easy to understand and use guidelines and suggestions for a more client friendly approach to phone contact."
3,All Tolstoy is not great literature,"When you start to read a book by Tolstoy you automatically assume it will be great literature. War and Peace, Anna Karenina, Resurrection...Well, two out of three isn't bad. What Tolstoy apparently wanted to do is to expose the corrupt prison system under the Czars. OK, but what he does is create a character who is entirely unbelieveable. His protagonist is a man who does a bad thing in his youth--has an affair with a young impressionable girl and dumps her--and then suffers a pang of conscience when he comes across her years later when she is accused of poisoning a man and stealing his money. He then puts on a hair shirt and proceeds through the book. Sorry but it just does not wash for me. It is worth reading but not if you have not read all the really great literature out there."
2,A political soap-box,"My first Tolstoy book. Tolstoy spent 100 pages developing a story and 400 pages complaining about the criminal justice system. Of all the imprisoned characters that Tolstoy introduced into the novel, not one of them deserved to be in prison. Not one lawyer, judge, or prison guard was described as a good person. When Tolstoy creates such a lop-sided story just to try and stress his point, I find it difficult to give his opinions merit. Tolstoy also presented his philosophy on the ownership of land in this book, which was much more interesting than his oft repeated view of the prison system."
3,Its no War and Peace,"I was blown away by War and Peace, which is an inspired and inspiring masterpiece. It brought me into a world of meaning beyond reading a book. It is a work of art, and something like a religious experience. Resurrection was comparatively ordinary, sorry to say. It may be good satire, or a fine protest novel, but I wouldn't call it a work of art."
1,please,"Personal feelings aside, I beseech, urge, command that whoever has not read Tolstoy before to stay away from this book until you have read ALL of Tolstoy's previous work. Then you'll realize how simplistic and dull this book is. If you want spiritual guidance, go to church or watch Oprah; if you want art, read all of Tolstoy through Anna Karenin. Peace."
5,Seeker,"This is one of my all-time favorite books. Anyone looking for masterful writing, skilled syntax or witty repartee: don't bother to read it. Anyone looking for depth and well defined characters: go away. But for anyone with a social conscience, or who is searching for their role in the worlds' morass, or any seeker of God, read on. As I become more ""enlightened"" more aware of an understanding of God, and more aware that each person we meet, we impact, I reread this book, and discover another lesson. I return to school until I have conquered it/come to realization of my limitations: then start the process again. I love it. It reflects my soul."
3,"Not Tolstoy's best effort, but good enough to read.","Essentially, the line of the book could be summed up as, ""Young aristocrat makes mistake, forgets mistake, remembers mistake, tries to make up for mistake"". During the course of this story line, the reader is pounded with the defects of a criminal justice system in which those who are supposed to be guilty are actually innocent and those who sentence them are actually the guilty ones. It isn't entirely convincing as Tolstoy tries to make the case that people who rob are doing it for survival and those who murder must have been drunk or inflamed with passion. The book ends with a poor thesis on what the purpose of life is and five rules for living your life. Not the best of endings, but the book is, for the most part, decent. Not his best work."
4,MoS did alright...but they can do better,"I must agree with some of the previous reviewers that MoS has been pumping out some of the same [stuff] for about 2 years now. However, they did change the pace a little with this new album. The first cd has some pretty good tracks, although some of them are kind of old and played out. Most of the tracks aren't even deep trance either, but I kind of expected MoS would do something like that. The second cd makes up for the first as it is good, deep trance, especially songs I haven't really heard before. Whoever mixed it definitely picked some great tracks for cd 2.**Bottom Line** 1st CD: Decent / 2nd CD: NICE!** Experienced listeners with MoS and all different kinds of techno in general will find this cd ok and that it has some pretty nice tracks. Newer listeners will morethan likely find it to be a very good album. **"
4,Decent book,"I went to school with the Jankhe's and after a recent high school reunion, I was more interested in their story."
2,Murder is Murder,I purchased the book as cheap as I could it was in fair condition.The story is so so but really not factual.They were convicted andthey Murdered their father simple as that allegations of abuse were justthat allegations
4,My 7 year old son loved it!,I read this to my seven year old son who enjoyed the pictures and the humor and the facts. It was a comfortable book to read and it sparked a lot of questions and conversation. I would definitely recommend it to the 5-7 year old age group.
5,PERFECT!,"This book is a PERFECT intro for kids 8ish and older. Unfortunately, my son was taught many explicit swears relating to body parts at recess (that most people say they didn't know until they were in college). This book was just right for an introduction. It doesn't go into too much detail, has great little comics to inject a little laughter/diffuse the embarrassment. I found it at our library and decided it was well worth buying."
1,to much info,"I bought this book to explain sex to my 10 year old daughter. I read it first then hide it fast! I didn't let my daughter read it. The book was good until it talked about masturbation. It says, ""Touching and rubbing your genitals to feel good is called masturbation."" This is not something I want her to know about yet. It also says 'sexual intercourse feels wonderful.' Well, I don't want her to know that either. (I don't want to lie to the girl!) So the hunt is back on for the perfect sex book."
1,Sans Sucre,"The mix is great, but not happy with sellers ad. It said that it is a 10 oz. box which it is not. I thought that I was getting a good deal when in fact I could travel a bit and get the same thing for half the price."
3,Superb sound and build quality but has no connectivity!,"Overall I was and still am very impressed with the sound and build quality of the system. However the main negative point that irritates me is the fact the the system has hardly any connectivity, especially that there is no digital input, which as the AUXILLARLY curcuit 'only' supports Dolby Pro-Logic, unables me to watch SKY MOVIES and use my XBOX etc in Dolby 5.1 as intended, and as I have paid over 350 for the device is disappointing."
4,Heads and Shoulders Above Mario's Music,"I'm a fan of the Series Metal Gear Solid, but I never took the time to really listen to the games's music. I bought this CD and was blown away, it's amazing how great the score is. The main theme is just incredable. The rest of the score is just alright, but it's the first track, the main there, that really sells the CD. I'm giddy to hear the MGS3 three soundtrack coming soon."
3,Not a very good game-to-disc transition,"Harry Gregson-Williams is a genius, and his music sounded very good in the game. But it didn't sound as good on the CD. A couple tracks were good, and the rest were fairly uninteresting. And the song ""Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday"" was terrible. Both the vocal version and the piano version are unlistenable. I always have to skip the tracks.Not a bad CD, but not worth the money. The original Metal Gear Solid music is of MIDI quality, but the composition was strong enough to make it a better album. Get that one and enjoy the MGS2 music as you're playing the game. The high cost of importing this album isn't worth it."
2,Getting Way Too Mainstream,"I remember back when Metallica was one of the best and most powerful bands out there, now they seem to have just lost what they used to have. Most of this CD sounds like it was recorded inside of a steel drum and they just don't have that Metallica sound that they had before. Given everyone says that bands must change and all that other stuff that they say, but with Metallica, why change something that was soooo good??!!"
3,It was OK,"I just finished this book, and although it wasn't the most exciting book I've ever read, I didn't think it was so bad. I thought the plot was pretty good, but it was the characters that I wasn't crazy about. The author doesn't make you care about them or have any sympathy for them like other authors do. I would try this author again, but I would not pay full price for one of his books."
5,delightful french romp,"Adolphe Adam is essentially remembered for his ballet ""Giselle""but he also wrote many opera-comiques mostly all forgottenexcept for ""Le Postillon de Lonjumeau"". Often referred as atenor opera because of its two famous florid and high-lyingarias - John Aler copes valliantly with the high tessiturawith a youthful, attractive and flexible voice and excellentfrench diction - the same can be said of June Anderson. Therest of the cast is in excellent hands - well recorded andconducted - this bargain reissue comes with a synopsis in bothfrench/english but no libretto. Highly enjoyable!"
4,Excellent System,"I am by no mean's an audiophile, so reserching different system's was a bit daunting.However after purchasing the system, I was knocked over by the quality of sound!After a bit of grumbling over direction's, I had the system up and running.Boy does this system deliver! Cranking the volume as far as I could without knocking picture's off the wall, the speaker's did not give a hint of distortion.I thought the system had a seperate powered sub-woofer. It does not. It does not matter. Deep rich base is all I could ask for. 16 guage wire is a must. Buy plenty if you need to re-arrange.It is a perfect system for medium sized room's with adjustable speaker range setting's.If you are looking for a system without breaking the bank,this is it!"
3,Size too big,"Good, and works in recipes where I use. Would prefer a smaller bottle so it won't go to waste as I don't use it that often."
2,Product expires in less than 30 days after I recieved it.,"I'm going to give the sellers time to respond. Maybe they made a mistake. But according to the label. I received this Product on May 14, 2012 and it expires on June 11, 2012."
5,An inspirational look at a technique that works,"This book presents an inspirational look at the corporate world that is seldom found on the business pages of major publications. The author makes it clear that following this path not only works for the company and its employees, but also for its customers and the greater public."
3,Choose it cause it's Good,"If you are looking for a method to become a great small company - this is NOT your book. If you are looking for anecdotes on how some small companies became great - then this IS your book. Read it, pass it around the office leadership and start thinking like a small giant..."
3,Not much new,This book didn't add much. Most of the information and pictures have been seen elsewhere.
2,Usual under-average Herbert-stuff,"I've nearly read everything by James Herbert, and I have to say he writes a lot of bad books. And a lot of average books. And some rare really good books. This one belongs in the middlefield.The story sounds interesting, but he doesn't make anything of it really. The war scenario is also useless. Even the title sounds sooo interesting, but in the end... well, is has some suspense, but it's pulp suspense with no real content.This is fast-read stuff. Okay, but time can be better spent."
2,Is this really a Herbert book?,This is a departure from the normal James Herbet writing. I was a bit disappointed. I wish he would get back into the true horror/suspense writing he normal does. This book gives you a twist on history. A different point of view of what could happen.
5,Memories on Paper,"There will come a time when we'll all be too old to recall the beautiful books we've read during our lifetime. Well, this wonderful, compact journal keeps a detailed record of all the books you read, whether or not you liked them and why. It is also good if you like to lend out your books (and then forget to whom they went) because it has a place to mark the name and date of a person you lent your precious book to. This is the best idea I have seen yet to help me record the memories of all the stories I read. As a chain-reader, this is a must-have for me. One day I will pass it on to my child and hope that he or she will choose to read a few of the books I read."
2,skip,this item is suppose to be new. And yet it skips and freezes. I can put in any dvd in my dvd player and wont skip or freeze. I am dissatified and disappointed in this item. And in the company for allowing to sell a disfunctional item.
2,The MLB Got This One Right,"A foul-mouthed, salacious, well-cast, occasionally entertaining, slice-of-life look at some Chicago Cub (Bruins) fans. Although the ensemble acting is effective and the movie has some satisfying moments, the merits don't outweigh the liabilities for me. I would love to be a bleacher bum at Wrigley Field, but if I sat anywhere near this set of fans, it would diminish my enjoyment. These are the Bleacher Barbarians, and the movie's treatment of a mentally unbalanced fan and his menacing of a player is disturbing. I would love to watch a game with the two old guys in the scoreboard, but they are only in the film for a few moments. In short, the movie doesn't have enough to redeem its winking at antisocial behavior, including compulsive gambling, and the MLB was wise to withhold its approval. I would love to watch the Cubs, but the Bruins not so much."
2,Not worth the money...,"It is way too large for a child's head. The blob on top sits on top of the head and has no functional purpose other than to make it top heavy. It seems durable, but it is not attractive. I don't know anything that could be done to it to modify it and make it better."
5,Smith's Sharpener works great for me.,Smith's Deluxe Knife & Scissors Sharpener sharpens my knives quickly and easily. I don't find it unsteady to use as the other reviewer does.
5,Razor Sharp,"Holy Ghost is razor sharp. They remind me (at times) of the great 90's noise bands Tar, Drunken Boat, and Helmet, and at others like a new form of tuneful machinery that won't let up. Bliss comes to mind, as well as hip swiveling fuzz heaven. A great record, possibly their best."
2,You get what you pay for,I have been having trouble being able to figure out if the test is positive or not but yesterday there was barely a line and today it's much darker but not as dark as the test line.... and the last two months I haven't had any luck they all were about the same.... I used the wondfo ovulation test before these ones and they worked awesome! I got this second set from clinic guard..... I dis like these since I can't tell if they are positive or not. I have looked online for similar complaints and have found a few with the same problem or the opposite problem.. (meaning all tests show positive...) I don't recommend purchasing these ovulation strips.
3,Not what i thought i was buying!!!!,"I thought i was getting the 5mm width, that's what i wanted so i could be sure of the result. Instead i got a very thin strip. I went ahead and used them but was not pleased b/c i had a hard time telling if the opk was positive. The test line was almost as dark as control, but only half of the line, so i'm not even sure if i even ovulated this cycle. The opk's where suspose to be babyhopes brand, that is what i paid for, and nowhere on the package does it say that, it just says clinical guard. So in the end they where just ok and i will not be purchaseing this brand again. Buyer please beware of the advertisement, b/c i did not get what i had exspected."
4,Excellent book for dealing with behavior problems,"Very useful book. Good information on dealing with problems, plus background information on animal and parrot behavior."
1,"Music plays, but no speaking","This movie looks interesting, but I found it a bit irritating as there was no words spoken. Maybe it just recorded wrong. Anyone else have this problem?"
4,Purchased as Anniversary Gift,"My husband and I had listened to Rod McKuen's Live at Carnegie Hall when we were dating. This CD is good, but not like the other (which is very expensive). We enjoyed the songs and they brought back lots of memories none-the-less."
3,Thats the big secret.?,"Depending on what you read and how much you read will determine your view on the book.I read alot of urban fiction so this book was just ok to me. The secret was very predictable. It wasn't an out of the world secret like I was hoping. Once again, very predictable. I wasn't in awe at all. I don't like how it ended for Secret so im not really pressed to read the sequel. But looking at the high reviews I might, but then again there is high reviews for this book as well.."
3,Of Academic Interest--Dreary,"Very disappointing and very uninspiring . Instead of discussing the ideas and theories in a common sense manner with foot notes covering other peoples books and theory and perhaps so wonderful pictures of tools etc . We the reader are taken through every academic name and theory as Mithen discusses with himself the virtues of the Swiss army mind model or the mind cathedral model .Incredibly dreary and what is more I thought he was off the mark .The human mind obviously started with signaling and reading others signals , whether regarding sex or hunting . But academics can never cut to the chase or the Brotherhood will ostracize them for stealing some other bookworms glory ! :-) The Holocaust gets a mention unnecessarily which I'm sick of hearing about ."
2,Too Grown Up For This,"It's sad when you've grown up with something, and when you go back as an adult to look at it again, it just doesn't hold up. I was IN LOVE with this series from age 11-16, so when she came out with a new, ""grown up"" continuation, I couldn't wait. But by ""grown up"" I think this author still means under 18, because this just really isn't realistic to adult life. Christy hasn't changed. She's still a whiny teenager. The spiritual aspect seems way over forced much of the time as well, and makes it seem far from realistic. As a young teen, that's what I loved about it- it was a fairy tale. But now we've grown up, and this just seemed obnoxious and dumbed down. As a wife and mother, this just seemed far too immature. I'm so sorry, I wish I loved it."
4,"Quality, but not quantity","The chosen demos were quite nice, but there would have been space for so much more (Mindcandy 1 was double sided)Where's Pulse by Nerve Axis? Where's My Kingdom by Haujobb? Where's Ocean Machine by TBL? Where's Odyssey by Alcatraz? It's not that there weren't other good demos available, they're just not included. Of course in some cases the authors of DVD might have been unable to get permission to include certain demo, but still there are so many classics missing...But then again, this is (afaik) the only DVD of its kind (amiga demos) and design is very good, so it's worth buying."
2,Everyone's Gotta Start Somewhere!,"I became hooked on RD when a roommate got a few episodes from the library. Then I began collecting them in order from the first episode. I'm glad I saw later installments BEFORE I saw Series 1, Episode 1 ""The End"". Otherwise I never would've watched at all. This tape of 3 episodes ARE ESSENTIAL for the COLLECTOR like myself who couldn't stand to NOT own them all. HOWEVER if it's laughs you're looking for ""spin on"" until at least Series 1, Episodes 4-6. ""Confidence and Paranoia"" and ""ME2"" are both very funny."
5,WOW!,"The ""one hit wonder"" is back! This album is very catch and amazing! Fergie! Justin Timberlake! Production from will.i.am...my oh my! This is the comeback album just like how Mary J. Blige did. Every song is catchy and single worthy!"
3,Yum,"Bought this for my little sister, I thought it was a little too spicy, but it was delicious. Good buy. Yumm :)"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"OK, i mean to get the pictures to the computer was pretty easy only took me a few minutes. now the pictures on the other hand REALLY [...]i mean i took about 18 pic (for some reason that is all it could hold but it said 20)and put them on the computer and all i saw was blobs. After i tried taking better pictures all i still saw was different colors of blobs..So then i was like ok i am going to try the webcab and for the money that was ok i mean MUCH MUCH better than i thought. [...]"
1,What a piece of junk!,"Thanks to a whopping misprint that should never have passed QC, half the pages of my ""manual"" are blank, and the Philips website does not seem to acknowledge the existence of this product. Nice. However, it is easy enough to get it all working. After which you soon discover that the camera is slightly better than nothing, but should really be a prize in a cereal box, not a product that you buy in a store."
4,Once you get used to it the book can be pretty good,"By the reviews in this site you will hate the book before opening it, but I would advise the reader to try it because once you go through it, it can be a pretty nice book."
5,Very Useful,Purchased this hat for my son to use in his school play about insects. It was perfect. I dressed him in all black placed the hat atop his head.
1,NON STANDARD FORMAT Media,Buyer beware. This CD & DVD need to install software in order to play on your computer. The music tracks are locked up in one big file (called yucca.cds).
3,A Slightly Different Delerium,"I came into Delerium several years ago, with the purchase of Poem and then Karma. I then followed with Odyssey. Just recently having discovered that there was something else to purchase, I delved in.This is different than their previous works. It has a definite ""pop"" flavor to it. There are some I don't care for, others that I like. So far my favorite is track 9 -- Fallen. It has a sad tone to it that I enjoy.If you're used to older Delerium, then you might not enjoy this. I prefer their older stuff, though.But remember, Delerium is a ""project"" -- not so much a group. It would seem that as any project, or even group, they might want to experiment some. Does this work? It works okay, but hopefully they will go back to some of the original stuff in the future.I rank this closer to 4 stars, but that's not a choice."
2,Underwhelming Album,"The best thing I can say about the album is that it's relaxing. When I heard the Poem CD, I got the sense Delerium was on the verge of selling out, and they've done so in grand fashion with Chimera. I wouldn't be surprised to hear tracks from this album on radio stations my parents listen to. I don't like being negative, but this isn't the sort of sound that made Delerium what they are (or were)."
3,not enough excellent material,"There's some truly excellent songs on Chimera, but just not enough of them. Apart from that Delerium are in danger of losing what uniqueness they had in favour of sounding like mainstread techno.Their early material is excellent in its own right.The second phase of their career was realized with Semantic Spaces, which was outstanding in its own way. Karma and Poem saw Delerium reaching out to the techno crowd a bit more, while still maintaining what made Semantic Spaces excellent.If Delerium continue in this direction for their next album, they will no doubt end up producing a future Madonna album. There must be pressure on them to sell to the masses but the trick is to do so without alientating their long-time fans.Depending on a person's taste in music, this wouldn't be the first Delerium album I'd recommend. For fans of the last three, buying this album is a no-brainer. Just prepare to be a tad disappointed."
1,Can we say Sell out????,"When I first heard a while back that Delerium was coming out with a new release, i was excited. Semantic Spaces had blown me away, Karma was a masterpiece, and Rhys Fuller Conjure One solo release was also quite amazing.. a little dark, but very unique. So i Purchased Chimera expecting to be amazed yet again, but much to my dismay, this cd absolutely had no personality. It was more pop, and more commerical sounding. The vocals did not measure up to previous releases, and i was crushed to say that Chimera is a total disapointment. This record, i am sure is a product of the record company getting their hands in and wanting to make a commerical hit cd, not a cd of quality, personality, or uniqueness..."
3,"A few solid tracks, many others are bland pop","Delerium's tipped the balance with Chimera - Poem having been the perfect combination of their original mysterious elements and the recent more modern, urban pop. To be honest I haven't listened to any of the albums before Poem in entirety, only some of the songs. But most of the tracks on Chimera are a huge swing out into the open - the tempos are quickened, there are more synth sounds, and the lyrics sometimes fall into a style template, rather than being original poetic creations like before. However this doesn't mean everything's turned for the worst - my favorite song on this album is Serenity, which is a gorgeous all-instrumental fusion of new age and dance pop. Truly and After All are also quite good.Overall Chimera is a modernization of Delerium's sounds. Good or bad thing? You decide. The cover art relays a sense of the bohemian and mystic, par to their past, but that is not so with this album. The sounds are changing."
1,I was disappointed.,"I wanted the fake grapes for a wreath I was making. Yes, it says they are small, but the grapes are so small, you really can't tell they are grapes. I guess I thought it meant a small bunch of grapes, not a small bunch of tiny grapes."
4,So fun and well made!,"Niece used as part of Halloween costume and sparked interest in magic! Holds many""rabbits"". Very Well made and adjustable size! Worth money!"
5,great product,ordered this for my daughter's 9 year old magic birthday party. She loves it and we used it for a scarf trick too.
4,A god is born but his memory is gone,"This book tells the tale of a god who is born with no memory. He slowly regains it as the book progresses. A evil godess is working against him, trying to become the only diety by manipulating him.This is the first fantasy book I've read by A. E. van Vogt. It has the same fast pacing as his other books and nearly constant revelatios, as well as numerous setbacks for the hero. I rather enjoyed it. Maybe it isn't a classic, but it is worth a read."
2,Mediocre,"This book is not one of the highest level. Much of the points about adolescent developments can be read from other more detailed works. While this book focusses on the Chinese perspective, from my own experience, some of the contents are rather cliche ridden and may not be that accurate."
5,Read this and you won't doubt homeschooling works!,"I read this book the first year of my marriage. I decided at that point that I'd like to homeschool our children.Selling my wife on it took some time. She never read the book, but after nine years of brain-washing, er um..., selling her on homeschooling, we're in our first year of full-time first-grade homeschool!Our son is doing great and our 4-year old joins in on our out-loud math challenges.I bought this book this year and read it again. Then my wife read it. The spark for giving our children a superior education has again ignited our homeschooling passions. Thanks to the Colfaxes!"
1,Yuck!,"I threw away my copy after reading it. If you are looking for a book on homeschooling by a Christian family, this is NOT the book.What a waste of money."
3,Love it ... Hate it.,"It works great. The thing I hate is the mess and the fact the refills only give you two refill pads yet lots of fluid. It comes with no ""how too's"" which I found very annoying. I am sure the pads are not that costly to them and neither is the fluid... PLEASE. When you clean THE PADS they seem to have a better life time. I had to email them to find that out.Great product if you do not want to use it for re-selling issued cd's. The amount of cd's i fixed were per pad was not acceptable for the price of refill. I could go on but i really wanted to let folks know how frustrated i have been with this. I have bought several refills and the machine works great ... its the skimpy pad refills that they need to fix.If you are selling cd's and are trying to fix them don't buy this. Time is money and I have wasted too much time on this product."
1,Beware of good reviews,"A good review written soon after purchase is not a good indication of what is in store. Like another buyer, my decision was made on good reviews. The unit worked great for 18 months, but then the drawer refused to open. Not much to be done except get a new one.On checking the reviews, found a number of people had problems after the honeymoon."
2,The Worlds Best Piano Arrangements,Book has nice arrangements but is quite thick and is not spiral bound (as described) making it impossible to keep open at the piano without breaking the spine.
1,I can't review it until I receive it,Where the hell is it...I haven't even gotten a confirmation from J & R & I need to give the gift on Sunday & although I have speedy PAID delivery...J & R doesn't deliver on weekends????
4,Can never get sick of the movie !,"Simply love the movie and everytime I watch it, it never fails to give me some insights of my own teenhood, love and career ! Drew Barrymore is great and natural and of course not to forget the great looking Michael Vartan ! It's a great movie not to be missed, especially for Drew Barrymore's fans...Go watch it !"
4,"Great movie, okay DVD.","This is one of my favorite movies. So, being in the dvd format allows me to watch it over and over again without worry of it wearing out like a tape. However, there isn't really any special features on the dvd...just the trailer for the movie. That was kind of disappointing, but that was the only down side."
1,Super corny. Not credible.,"Far fetched!!! She has never been kissed (obviously!) and she's 25, just happens to go to the school with the teacher who is basically her soulmate, finds nerdy friends but then finds catty friends, has awesome brother who makes everything ok, gets asked to the prom by the cool guy Guy (still 25 mind you), and everything works out because she blows her cover! It's stupid too! She starts crying every 5 seconds, goes into a weird fairytale mode when she talks to the teacher/soulmate, and is obsessed with Shakespeare and correcting people on grammar! Not something I would recommend..."
3,Loves Labours Lost,"This film is the perfect portrayal of the musical genre, with modern day actors (who danced fabuously). The library scene toucHed me to my core, and the scoring built up a perfect crescendo , portraying the love that we all felt for the King! Classic! Definately 'Top of the morning to you!' and 'Guut'."
1,Precious,"What a wonderful film--cut and paste formula pabulum built on calcified romantic cliches, listless acting, poor TV sitcom humor and a directorial clumsiness that would make Gary Marshall wince. Drew Barrymore is so cute she makes the Teletubbies seem like festering chancre sores. And she's so clever she chooses a script with the worst aspects of an old Shakespeare plot cross-bred with Cameron Crowe. You might think that the youth of America could find a better person to idolize than a cynical Hollywood insider who obviously has very little respect for the fans who paid for her houses in Malibu and Beverly Hills. Then again, you might not."
4,"Formulaic, but very fun...","The AMAZON reviewer was a bit harsh. Yes, this movie is a tad formulaic: typical teen nerd turns cool (with a twist). But the script is funny and the acting is great. For smooth Drew, playing a nerd is one of the best acting jobs she's done-- she's so good, it's painful and embarassing to watch!Leelee Sobieski has a minor role in which she shines, as well. Molly Shannon is a wonderful sidekick.Even the second time around (by request of my 7-yr. old daughter), I thoroughly enjoyed the film!JM"
4,Typical Teenage Delight,"In this movie, the actors & the director has together been able to delight & please the audience. Drew Barrymore ( Josie Geller ) has acted out her charcter well to show that the typical teenage years can have both it's pleasing & distressing moments. Barrymore & the rest of the cast has also shown the typical teenage language & dress so it can easily assosiate with the typcial-american real life schools. Never Been Kissed's charcter Sam Coulson ( played by Michael Vartan ) shows a different view of the typical teacher. Normaly, the usual school teacher is neither so young nor so good in looks, but hey, where would the fun & happy ending be without a lovely Josie Geller and a cute guy like Sam Coulson !?"
4,Never Been Kissed,Movie was in new and arrived quickly. I love this movie! If you like Drew Berrymore you're sure to love this movie.
4,great movie,"When Never Been Kissed first came out in theatres last year, I never thought that it would become one of my favorite flicks. It ranks up there with another favorite teen flick of mine--16 candles. They have the same elements: geeky girl, fine-looking object of affection, and about high school life. Everytime I see this movie, I get moved by it even though I'm 25 years old. It's really a feel good movie. Drew was natural as Josie and Michael Vartan was also natural as the english teacher. he's also hot! I think that deep inside all of us is that we are hopeful to find the right person who respects us for who we are. Mr. Sam liked Josie for her intelligence, warmth, and kindness and not because she's pretty or have other physical assets that typical men drool over. I highly recommend this movie."
3,This rating is for the Blu Ray PQ quality.,"I purchased this movie for an upgrade to my dvd. It is not a great film,but it is a cute movie and I have always enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure. But this Blu-ray is a very poor transfer. Detail gets lost,colors sometimes pop,sometimes are washed out. The sound isn't what you would expect either. I had to keep adjusting the volume. If you already own the dvd, I would say to keep it and not do the ""upgrade"" since the Bd looks like an upconverted dvd anyway. I now know to read reviews before thinking every Blu-ray will be an upgrade."
4,VERY NICE!,I've never not liked Drew. Cute story that most can relate to with the high school experiences and has a great surprise ending.
1,Get caught up on laundry or wash your car. Don't rent this!,"I am one of the few people that liked Pet Sematary, directed by Mary Lambert as well. I didn't expect much from this film, but even considering that, I can't express what a complete waste of time watching this was. It kinda reminds you of Prom Night II Hello Mary Lou in a few storyline aspects, along with a couple of other films. Nice job on the camera angles at the girl's slumber party, I'll say that much for it. Do yourself a favor and get caught up on something else, anything other than watching this piece of garbage. You won't like this film, I promise you. Go watch ""Cursed"" instead. Now that was decent!!"
4,Conflict resolution,"Should it be regular or decaf? Now it does not matter as I can have my coffee and my wife can have hers. Just what we were looking for in a coffeemaker. Two pots, two reservoirs, two brewing baskets. Excellent quality at a very reasonable price. Plus, no timer, so my coffee is hot now, 2 hours from now or four hours from now. Yes, that could be construed as a negative, as now I need to be responsible and turn my coffee maker off. But that is OK, I am an intelligent consumer who has to be held responsible for something. Really a great product."
5,Great reminder service,"I actually gave this product to my boss who, as Vice President of the company, has a load of engagements to schedule, plan, and keep in mind. He's told me it has helped him a lot to organize his busy schedule, without being tediously difficult to handle.Thanks!"
4,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!,"It was the fastest read ever for me. I could NOT put this book down. I was always anxious to see what the next person would say. It was written beautifully and kept my interest THE WHOLE TIME! I was so impressed, I ordered ""Bebe's by golly wow"". I know it's going to be the bomb!"
2,Say What?,"I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were poorly developed and childish. I did not like any of them, and what is the use of reading a book if you cannot identify with the protagonists? Keep trying."
4,Pretty Good,This was a pretty good book. The only issue I have is that it does not read as easy as I would have liked. I wish the author would explain more about the individuals and events that happened. It seems to me that the author expects the reader to have some sort of base of knowledge about the Serbs and Balkans before reading this book. I recommend it to those who are interested in learning about the Serbs but I also recommend doing research on each item that is brought up through the book to get a better understanding.
5,Enchanting!,"I loved this book! The characters were charming, quirky, and unforgettable. Julie Beard has a marvelous gift for creating characters that come alive. I'm a fan of her medievals, but this is thoroughly enjoyable change for the talented Ms. Beard."
3,A pleasant diversion -- 3.4 stars.,"Despite some less than successful elements (like the exorcism & Lucas' total acceptance of Robbins' early beatings), this book successfully reworks the Pygmalion/My Fair Lady storyline, albeit with a twist that not all will find welcome. I do because anything else would have eventually unraveled. The secondary characters are nearly as well developed as the main ones. The secondary romance is off the beaten path. At times, the ghost element was a little strange and overly complex (confusing), but most of the book worked quite well."
3,My Fair Lord---Fair being the operative word,"My Fair Lord is a good book, a quick enjoyable read, but very predictable. I know, I know, historical romances only have so many places they can go-but this just didn't work for me. The first half of the book was really good-a different direction. I would have enjoyed the book more if it had developed more of a poor street thug with a heart of gold rather than an earl with a memory loss-this was just a little too predictable (not to mention convenient). It is a nice quick read, but not anything I would re-read."
2,Maybe waiting another year or two...,"Last year, The Proposition did a role-reversed Pygmalian story like this one. Both books end in eerily the same way. Speaking of eerie, My Fair Lord has something that The Proposition didn't: Ghosts, for all the good it did this story. For most of this book, it seems that the writer can't decide if she wants to write a ghost story or a romance. Since the romance in this story is dull and predictable, the ghosts could have been used more effectively. They weren't.The heroine, Caroline, like Winnie in the Proposition, is just THERE, things happen to her, but she doesn't have much spark. Both heroines were, to be blunt, saps. Where the two books again diverge is in the hero: Nick of The Proposition was a fabulous leading man--fun-loving, charming, and knee-buckling, heart-poundingly masculine. Lucas seemed to be a very pale imitation of Nick.This book could have been so much better; being released so soon after The Proposition only makes its faults more glaring."
4,Maisie,I have watched two of the series so far and enjoyed them both.The stories are light weight but suit for this kind of film.. Ann Sothern acts well in these films and they make for an entertaining hour or so.Very good print quality (better than TCM cable prints) even though they have not been restored.Certainly worth purchasing.
5,Me review Machiavelli's Book - Absurd!,"As the first political ""how to"" manual, The Prince has withstood the test of time. He analyzes different methods of gaining power, and once gained, how to keep it. A masterpiece of early political thought. Its methods can be applied to many aspects of life today."
4,Still relevant,"Machiavelli's brilliant text (I read the N. H. Thomson translation, in the Dover Thrift edition) is sometimes disturbing, but ultimately brilliant in its analysis as to the achievement of political power. His arguments are rational and succinct, and it amazed me how relevant all this was to today's political landscape! Who could have thought that a document nearly 500 years old would survive and remain important."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This made ZERO difference in my energy, stamina or hunger and although the flavor was tasty, it didn't last as long as other gums that I'm used to chewing."
2,"Same as Emerson EWD2202, Horrible Remote","This unit is the same as the Emerson EWD2202 except for some minor cosmetic changes for obvious reasons. I also believe that this unit and the Emerson unit are actually manufactured by the Funai corporation.The remote control feels very cheap and has to be pointed directly at the unit to function. Also, the remote is overly large and is very uncomfortable to hold and operate as the buttons are small and placed in odd locations.Overall the unit itself seems to operate well and has played both DVD's and VHS tapes without difficulty. The unit also plays audio CD's and MP3 files well and even plays MP3 files located in sub-folders."
1,"not great, wife hates it, had to buy a new one","I've had this DVD/VCR for several months. The display quality of DVDs and VHS is good. There are design deficiences that are annoying: must press a button on the unit (not remote) in order to activate VCR timer recordings, cannot stop a timed recording without pressing this same button, cannot do a one-touch timed recording with the remote, audio gets out of sync with about 50% of DVDs played (pause or stop/restart to resync)."
5,Wow,"These are so sharp, and well balanced. I was given a MAC knife years ago and loved it and I'm so glad I found another one. I love them!"
2,"Good content, terrible editing","I am currently reading this book for a Masters class in Psychology and although I am enjoying the content of the book and find it to be quite interesting, I am completely put off by how many errors there are throughout the text! It is kind of unforgivable to publish a book, especially one that is used as a scholarly source, to be filled with so many errors. I will not share detailed examples due to copyright laws but if you take a look at page 47 at the end of the first paragraph the author mistakenly writes ""that"" when the correct word should have been ""than"". This was probably the 10th error that I had come across in only 47 pages! I do not understand HOW these errors were not corrected. All in all, I am disappointed in how the book has been put together and feel that it loses credibility when words are incorrect throughout the text."
3,less then expected,the book i ordered was more damaged then i expected.highlights thru out were not mentioned ... it is a serviceable book though....
3,it's okey,"the sheath is trash, but the knife is okey for under $20 i give it a three, out of five it works, but would not want to use it for my hiking. this will be my new jeep knife. the blade looks rough, and won't keep an edge for long, but is easy to sharpen. if your son is in boyscouts, or something this knife would make a good teaching blade."
1,Great knife for digging in the dirt!,"I actually had one of these, it was the biggest POC I ever owned. Save your money and just get a Ka-Bar!"
3,industrial strength..,"Minimalist; can't hardly see it when loaded with tp, guess that's the point. Since so expensive, i'm making it double as chin-up bar"
2,gimme noise? gimme hot hot hot!!!,"Most of this album appears to be filler. (Androgynous? didn't Prince write that?). But GARY'S GOT A BONER is righteous. ROCK 'N' ROLL! Seriously, this is one of the most sensitive and forgiving odes to human frailty committed to digital since IT'S A SIN. And the Replacements kick the Pet Shop Boy's you know what! My fraternity brothers have got this on the CD version of speed dial-if you know what I mean. Crank it high-crank it way high!"
4,Helpful Pretty little pink book,It is not only pretty but very helpful. Everyone should know the proper behaivor for any situation.
1,Poison deodorant! Do not buy this!!!,"The advertising on this deodorant promoted a ""natural"" product, yet the first ingredient is Propylene Glycol. Ok, so if you are not aware, Propylene Glycol can cause abnormalities in the heart, liver and even lead to kidney disease. This is a very dangerous product! DO NOT BUY THIS! Good health is something we should all be able to enjoy, and companies like this one could care less...appalling."
4,solid british comp,"I was a bit disappointed that Teenage Jesus and the Jerks were not included in New York Noise, but, despite their absence, the album sounded quite good. This cd's insert was packed with photos and information on the bands and No Wave."
4,Plunkitt Doesn't Mince Words Here: He's a Politician,"Plunkitt makes no allusion to his goals: money for himself through patronage of his loyal constituency. He really is quite endearing in his straightforwardness about the game of politics. If any of our presidential hopefuls were a fraction as honest as Plunkitt, they would have my vote guaranteed."
2,Disappointing copy of a political classic,"I purchased this copy of ""Plunkett of Tammany Hall"" to give away as a gift but I was very disappointed. Other copies of ""Plunkett..."" which I've owned have included such contemporary references as photographs, Thomas Nast cartoons, reprinted newspaper articles and a glossary of terms. This version is nothing but very slim volume William Riordon's record of Plunkett's observations on government printed on cheap paper within a nondescript cover.My recommendation is for you purchase one of the more complete versions of this political classic which can be found on the market."
1,Did these reviewers actually OPEN the book? It's a MISPRINT!!,"Garbage in, Garbage out. I ordered this for my cousin, who's going into politics, and was astounded, when I looked past the first page, to find that, rather than reading Plunkitt talking about a little ""honest graft,"" I was instead reading GOBSECK, by de Balzac!Oh, the cover says Plunkitt... but it's completely misprinted on the inside. How Amazon and the other reviewers missed this is beyond me."
5,Handy quick & easy hook,"I bought a few of these hooks to be used in our motor home, since wall space is so limited. It fits easily over the cupboard doors & is great for hanging towels, clothing, purses or anything!"
2,"not the best guide, but not bad","Peterson's guide was my first as a child, so I don't want to bad mouth it, but it is not the best. Since then I have used just about every other guide available. Peterson's seems to have fallen behind in several areas. The illustrations are not as good as those in the National Geographic guide. The accidental and exoctic species are listed seperatly at the end of the book, and not all of the birds listed are shown!!! Im not sure if this is a mistake or not. Accidentals are also shown seperately, not alongside similar species or birds with similar appearance. This makes it somewhat confusing to identify some birds. Very little information is given about them, and usually there is nothing more than a head shot. I wouldn't use it as a primary reference, but it does make a good companion to other guides, especially ones with photographs rather than watercolors."
4,Good reference,"First I was disappointed due to the lack of detail in this book, however later I found that I kept opening it up to get some advice before I planted something new in my garden. It is tough to cover everything about gardening in a single book, so if you look at it that way he does a great job. You can get the basics with this book, and if you still need further detail get a specific book for that question or look it up online. The pictures are beautiful, so I can see this book as a winter chaser, getting your mind prepared for the spring."
2,Disappointing,"Not at all what I expected.The graphics were superb. I was particularly tickled by the flashing cameras as I passed the spectators.The gameplay is almost laughable. On the mud/snow based courses, you more or less keep the trigger fully depressed and slide sideways 95% of the track. I was curious as to how I could slide at a 45 degree angle the entire length of a straight-away at 120mph.I am an avid fan of racing games. The Dreamcast will be a fine racing console, I'm sure. But this title would be better suited as a free system enclosure rather than a stand alone game.Rental only."
3,This One's Pretty Good!,"More than any other, this is the ""family episode"" of Battlestar Galactica. So many children on screen at one time can be grating, and the plot is fairly cliche, yet there are many enjoyable parts.Seeing the legion of Cylon Centurions inside the medieval castle is fascinating. Spectre is a very good, conniving villain, and Lucifer's reactions to his blatant lies to Baltar are hilarious. This kind of story runs the risk of being a little too ""cute"", but it is very enjoyable for any classic sci-fi fan."
4,Good Product,"Attractive Black front panel. Easy to set up, worked first time right out of box ! Video and audio quality good for a mid priced unit. Quiet DVD and Tape. Labels for lights and buttons on front of unit difficult to read in dim/under shelf location. Remote is on the small side. Some remote button labels in blue difficult to read in low light, not back lit. Still pleased with the purchase and give 4 stars. Worth the price"
1,Defective model,"dvd worked great,vhs was defective,found to have bad tape end sensors, im sure not all of them, but mine did. IF you get a bad one, just return it with your receipt and get another."
4,Helpful Overall,"A great way to review for the GRE. Practice tests help simulate actual test conditions. There are a few typos, but they don't detract from the ability of this resource to prepare you for the test."
