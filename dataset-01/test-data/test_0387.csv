4,Travel Bingo,"It was a wonderful game for the children to play in the car. It would have been nice to have a little more variety in the things they had to find. The format was different, but the cards had the same things to find."
2,Disappointing game,"This game looked promising and the packaging is very appealing, but the game itself is very boring. My four-year old enjoyed this the first few times we played but now she really has lost interest. Not a game for the long run."
5,An intriguing open-ended conversation...,"Writer Lynn Kear is NOT presenting the reader with her own formulated, rigid point of view here. This is an exploration of the subject (or as the title infers, ""an investigation"") and has the feeling of an open-ended conversation. A conversation in which more than one point of view is welcome and can be accommodated. The bulk of the book is in fact made up of what I'd call testimonials- gay people, who believe in re-incarnation, telling their own stories. Kear never judges what they have to say. She objectively listens, records and compiles. It makes for intriguing reading."
4,A good philosophy.,"I not sure you can really call this a ""diet"" book, but it does guide you on some healthy principles for living. Her basic idea is to eat the best quality food and to treat yourself with respect. How bad can that be? And her recipe for a Hot Chocolate Bubble Bath is to die for!"
2,damaged during shipping- poor replacement options,"Bike arrived in a busted up box, missing pieces and damaged. Amazon offered several less than ideal replacement options.Who knows if the bike is any good. But I have noticed several other customers mentioning that the bikes arrived broken or bent, I just wanted to let you know that trying to get a replacement isnt easy and from the looks of things its going to takes us weeks to get a new bike. Hope its not snowin'."
4,Good sturdy bike but damaged during shipping,"Bought this bike for my 7 year old son along with a similar one (Mongoose Chill) for my 10 year old daughter. Both bikes arrived damaged -- one had missing and bent parts, another had broken and bent parts. Problems were solved (both Amazon and Pacific Bicycle were helpful) but it was a long and frustrating experience. Allow 1 hour for assembly. The bikes are sturdy and well made, but a little bit crude. They are heavy and only have a single speed so they are not good for hills. But they look cool, and my kids love them! My 7 year old is a little bit small for the bike, my 10 year old is a little bit big on hers. Both my kids are average size, so I think the guideline of 7-11 years old is accurate."
4,1st in a nice series,"I read through all four books in this series in the time leading up to Christmas. It's a worthwhile investment in entertainment time, with beautiful scenery, nicely developed characters and a story line which contains enough adventure and uncertainty to keep the interest piqued. Great themes of forgiveness and redemption, risk and reward where the heart is involved. Highly seeker-friendly if you'd like to introduce someone to faith fiction."
5,creative ideas,"I have enjoyed reading this book and learned some new techniques I hadn't thought of doing. Well written, clear directions and great photos and illustrations. Many books are not concise about the best product to use for installation and this provided very specific conditions for various products."
2,This Book Needs a Road Map,"This would be a good, if somewhat light-hearted, book if written in a logical manner. There is not a straightforward approach to creating a table, setting all properties, making changes, etc. There are always other chapters to go to in order to finish what I am in the middle of doing right now! What should be step by step instructions is instead spread throughout the book in a haphazard fashion. Not for someone pressed for time."
1,Collapsed constantly & not sturdy,Don't waste your money on this. The side bar holders wouldn't stay up or straight on it.
5,Great album,This album was great. I love finding bands like this that have a good sound but faded into obscurity before they could really come out into the open. Their music reminds me slot of breaking Benjamin ( their second and third albums). It's a mellowed kind of hard rock. If you want here what they sound like listen to the song at the end of reign of fire.
3,Warning!,"Look, this is a perfectly good docking station, and if you are planning to jack it directly into your stereo system or radio; it'll work fine.HOWEVER...If, like me, you like to use an FM Modulator; be warned that this unit does NOT come with one built in. Yes, I should have noticed that before I bought it; but I didn't. I just want to save someone else from making the same mistake that I did."
2,Professional hitman left off list,"Did we need a book for this? I've thumbed this book in mild, introverted amusement a couple of times, but really, it doesn't tell you anything you can't find on a website out there.It could be that half the people you work with at your job are, in fact, introverts, and they're doing whatever you're doing. It's not a disease, and people can adapt.And frankly, it's all fine and good to say 'be a writer' or 'be an artist', but that hardly helps as these are professions one rarely can plan out with any certainty unless they are in the service of something other than yourself.A couple of professions are suspiciously missing, though I guess they have their reasons. Professional mercenary might be good (if you're into that sort of thing) or professional hitman, since that seems like an area you can have plenty of alone time as you trail a potential target or intimidate witnesses.Surprisingly, truck driver is missing, though mail service is included. Go figure."
3,Not what I expected,"I recently moved from a house to an apartment and was in need of more space so I bought two of the vinyl under the bed shoes bags. I must admit that I was not impressed with the quality of the bag; I found it to be very flimsy. However, it did serve the purpose as for why I bought it. I now have my shoes put away and stored under my bed. I've also found it good for putting away summer shoes and bringing out the fall/winter ones, which is a plus. So overall, it's not a bad purchase for the price."
5,Great Size/Weight/Quality Value,"At 5.5 lbs and pretty good quality, I found the tent to be a great value at $92. More than enough room for two grown men, would probably be tight with three, but that's true of every 3 person tent. The rain guard has enough room to put your pack outside the tent and still be covered.Took it 28.5 miles this past weekend in the Smokies backcountry and was very pleased."
3,Heavier than listed,"Haven't had a chance to use it but I am considering returning it. The actual weight is heavier than what they list, the actual weight is 6.5 lb."
4,Great Value,"I have used this tent on two backpacking treks this spring. It is easy to setup and is very roomy for two adults. While it may not be an ultra-light, split between two peoole, the weight is not a problem. My one grip is the vestibule doirs. If you are not careful when you unzip them, they ""fall"" back towards the tent spilling an rain or dew they have collected on you and your gear."
5,Passed initial test,"Just got back from our first trip with this tent, and it performed admirably. Set up was quick and easy, as was take down.We had high winds and rain, but the tent felt solid and not a single drop of moisture collected or leaked inside. Overall, a great product for the price we paid (bought it on sale).The 5 of 5 rating indicates that the tent is as described and performs all the functions it claims.Was very roomy for two, and lightweight for its size (though it might be a tad heavy for extended backpacking treks - still, light enough to hike with for a few miles).Recommended"
4,Best cat drinking fountain ever!,"Best cat drinking fountain ever! My cats hate all drinking fountains made for pets. This however they absolutely love. We had it continuously running for almost a year. The light has burned out, but the fountain still works. Could do with a few more rocks, top can easily be knocked over if you do not use the rocks to weigh it down."
3,"Not great, does its job though",First thing you will notice is how its cheaply made. It's plastic but from a distance it's hard to tell. It woeks just fine and actually pretty relaxing so no problems with it working. If your looking for something high class than this is not for you. It's still a good working little fountain though for the price.
1,Save your money...,"I have to agree with the people who said this is very cheap. I had an old fountain which the pump went on, it was a beautiful pottery bowl with beautiful smooth stones in it. This one look nice from the image but when I got it home i found it to be VERY cheaply made. The water needs to be refilled all the time because the reservoir is so small. The slate stones feel almost plastic and do not go all the way around. They are barely strong enough to hold up the small stones that come with it. The water flow is very low even on the highest setting. Save your money and put it towards a nicer fountain for a little more money."
2,Not so great.,"The unit is extremely cheaply made, and does not have a good water flow amount, or even from top to bottom. No matter how I arranged the rocks. Works nothing like the picture. The bottom rim isn't wide enough to avoid any spillage. The pump is weak. You can hear the the sound of the water, but it just works nothing like a few trickles here and there. If you really play with the angles of the levels & rock angles you can get a more even water flow, but still just in trickle level. Based on the cheap construction I'm not sure how long it will last."
3,waterfall,"This waterfall has been satisfactory. Quiet and pleasant water sound, dim light and rocks all are as advertised. The problem was that one of the plastic pieces was broken from delivery. I was able to superglue that piece back together and cover the seam with the rocks. Basically, an inexpensive and aesthetically pleasing waterfall."
1,YUCK,This thing was kind of satisfying when it was new before the lightbulb wen out. jIt is not good though we were lying to ourselves. Totally grasping at life and trying to be happy. Moving the rocks around is fun. The back of it! The mere fact that it has a back is awful ugly. I guess maybe you could say the good stands out more if there is something you do not like about it. I really do not agree.
2,"Fixation on racing results, not the car itself","Since the book ""Original AC Cobra"" is out-of-print and so expensive, I decided to give this book a look. It was very disappointing. It had a bit about the car, and a few interesting pages of historical overview of what the main players (Tojeiro, Shelby, and AC) were up to before the Cobra project.The problem is that once the book got to what should be the meat of the story, it devolved to a ""this person drove that car is this race, and experienced blah blah blah DNF"".While I realize that the Shelby's whole motivation was to go racing, I was expecting a more reasonable balance between information about the car and the races.There were a few redeeming characteristics of the book. A few interesting photographs of the frames, some assembly line photos, and assembly-line information about all the orginal Cobras.Bottom line, get this book if you are interested in the racing history. Skip it if you are looking for much information about the cars themselves."
5,Cheater's Review,Eric Jerome Dickey's book has entered my must read list. I picked the book up and didn't want to put it down; however I do have a job so it took me 2 days to read it. It was suspenseful. The characters and their situations were like a soap opera that kept you returning to find out what happened next. My recommendation is to read this book. I have also read his new release Liar's Game which is also very good. So grab a copy and get ready for a good time.
5,True life reading. A wonderful book.,"Eric Jereome Dickey's characters in this book are great. I can see some of my friends in the characters. Chante' in this story was great. I can see myself in her character. I really loved the way the friends all came together when it counted. I look forward to another book by this author. I have read all of his books ""Friends and Lovers"",""Milk in my Coffee"" and others but none I enjoyed like ""Cheaters""."
4,These are characters we can all identify with...,"All the characters in this book are like friends we've all had. Now maybe their lives are more varied with casual sex but they are striving to figure out what they want and what/who is important?I liked the first person style of each chapter, rotating through all the characters.This was the first book I've ready by E.Dickey and enjoyed it."
3,SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT CALL IT CHEATING,"CHEATERS WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY SON. I ALREADY MADE MY MIND UP THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS BOOK MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE TITLE. I READ THE BOOK AND FOUND THE WRITING WAS EXCELLENT AND FLOWING. THE BOOK HELD MY INTEREST AND THERE WERE A FEW SURPRISES,ESPECIALLY THE ENDING."
3,OK AY READ,"I'M A BIG FAN OF ERIC JOROME DICKEY. I MUST SAY THAT I DIDN'T ENJOY THIS NOVEL AS MUCH AS I ENJOYED FRIENDS AND LOVERS, SISTER SISTER AND MILK IN MY COFFEE BUT I'M STILL A BIG FAN OF YOURS ERIC. YOU ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS. I FOUND CHEATERS TO JUST SHOW HOW MEN AND WOMEN CHEAT ON EACH OTHER AND THE PAIN THAT COMES WITH THE CHEATING. I WILL SAY THAT THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL DEVELOPED AND THE FLOW OF THE BOOK WAS SMOOTH. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND BE BLESSED!"
3,CHEATER CHEATER,"loved this book. This book had trust, distrust, loyalty, commitment, and everything else in a relationship. Stephan played a great character. He was raised in a home with no father until his step-father. His father was a cheater so he later had some of those ""cheater"" qualities. Toyomi played a great character. She was like a ""ghetto queen"". When it came to back stabbing and getting revenge she was your girl. I don't believe in adultery , but I loved the way Darnell cheated on his wife. His wife treated him [badly] and he just kinda got sucked into the ""game"". The way he left her at the end of the book was great. He said I leaving, and don't try to contact me."
5,Engrossing Page Turner,"""Cheaters"" is the first book that I have read by Erick Jerome Dickey...but it will not be my last. It is a page turner that kept me up until 4am finishing the book. I have recently purchased Milk In My Coffee and Friends and Lovers. I recommend that if you are on the ""shelf"" about reading any of his works that you rush out immediately and purchase his entire collection."
3,Overly written,"If your looking for a book that will take you to many confused places than you should definitely read Cheaters, I enjoyed the dynamics between Chante and Stephan. Darnell which is one of the characters in book made it hard for me to want to read. But overall it was good book that talked about cheating and how it was in Los Angele's."
5,cheaters,dickey's best work. paints an intruiging picture. main characters have depth and their flaws are put out there in a way that makes their stories believable. dickey's detailed description of california through the eyes of his characters makes me feel as if i'm there. he takes a subject that almost everyone has either an opinion or a personal experience and brazenly entitles the book with that controversial one word title.
3,Started but not Finished!,"I really did enjoy this book I couldnt put it down. But I felt a little cheated about the Storyline of Tammy, i wish the author would have gone a little deep with her character. The book had the worst ending ever, I mean I know not everyone can have a fairytale ending but I feel there are still alot of loose ends that should have been tied up."
4,"Great pan, worth every penny! Great quality","Great pan! So many uses... Great for chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, bacon oh, and pizza too! Great quality pan, made in USA!"
4,Fun Toy for an Elmo Lover,"Our 20 month old daughter loves her Tickle Me Elmo. She really loves anything Elmo, or Sesame Street. We actually don't let her watch TV, so this Elmo doll gives her a chance to hear him talk and giggle. The first time she saw him, she just went nuts, and laughed along with him. Now she loves to take him everywhere. It is nice that even though he does have the box in him to make him laugh and talk, he is still very soft and cuddly - since she likes to sleep with him as well. He's a great size for her to play with and carry around. He is very cute, and fun."
5,"A surprisingly ethereal, gorgeous soundtrack","This deliciously moody, ethereal soundtrack is much too good for the movie it accompanies. It is very evocative and surprisingly relaxing music. I am on my second copy, and still love it.It is good for the very reason that it does not overly try to be ""haunting"" and ""spooky."" It moves me in the same way some of Mark Isham's work does. This is standout work."
4,Keep in mind I bought this for a class,"I bought this for a class, otherwise I would be in my easy chair channel surfing. But regardless, with all the books I had to read for the class this one I really got into. It did help that where lots of sex and the guy losing his....well you will have to read to find out what happens to him. Tip it's the store owner.So for someone who doesn't care much for reading I give it 4stars."
2,Great dictionary that will fall apart in your hands.,I purchased this dictionary 6 months ago at a local bookstore. I had researched French dictionaries fairly thoroughly. It is one of the most expensive of the paperbound dictionaries but consistently gives good examples of words in useful phrases. In addition it gives pronounciation and has a concise but useful grammar section. Within a month I had bonded with this dictionary. The problem is that within two months the dictionary was literally falling apart in my hands. Each week new sections of 50 pages or so would come loose from the binding. Now after 6 months I have a paper binding with a thousand loose pages. I cannot recommend this text. A dictionary is a tool that becomes your friend and its hard to watch your friend fall apart in front of you. Harper Collins should be ashamed of their cheap bookbinding. It is a waste of paper.
1,"OK if you are in high school, maybe.","I grant that my vocabulary is larger than average, but I seem to know every word in this dictionary. Words that I do not know are not in it. If you have graduated from college, I don't think it would be much use. The thesaurus gives only a few alternatives and it gives you no idea of what word would be the better choice, so it is not much use."
1,Piece of Garbage,What a crock. My machine conked out a week after the 90 day warranty expired. To get it repaired I have to ship it to CA (I live in FL). The shipping charges and minimum cost of repair is more than I paid for the machine.
3,Most of the stones are pretty..,"I purchased this product when it was on sale for $9.99. The one thing that I really don't like about it, is that the 2nd blue stone (above the 2 moonstones)- which I believe is the Lapis- looks very cheap. This is my first experience with this particular stone, so I'm not sure if it's common to have gold specks in it (it looks like someone sprinkled some gold glitter on it). Perhaps that's the way the stone is supposed to be, but to me it makes it look cheap. Other than that, I like all the other stones. It's large, so it could easily be seen on a chain.EDIT 2012: I actually haven't worn it since date of purchase (back in '08), but I kept stored it in a little velvet pouch. Sadly it's tarnished already, especially the loop part- it's almost black! (Maybe this grade of silver easily tarnishes?) Perhaps with the right cleaner it would look nice again."
5,Chris Cunningham's Rubber Johnny,"While I have not seen this, I have seen enough of Cunninghams work to know what to expect. This should be well delivered with Chris's touch of dark playful images.http://www.putfile.com/media.php?n=rubjohn&width;=320here is another video, which adds much to the trailer at rubberjohnny.tv. Also for more on Cunningham go towww.director-file.com/cunninghamAlso recommened...www.director-file/gondryHey Raleigh, NC. Chris isn't exactly OUR national treasure. He's British."
3,4 years to make this thing!?!?!?!,"According to Warp's site, this thing was 4 years in the making. It's as brilliant as anything else Cunningham has done, even if it does feel like a Taco Bell commercial directed by David Lynch (not a bad thing mind you). I was really hoping for more. It's just another music video. I guess I was hoping for at least a 30-minute short film. Something along the lines of Lynch's 'The Grandmother'. Cunningham has been over this format before (6-7 minute shorts). It's time to graduate to something bigger Chris. I know you can do it. Don't be afraid. Give us a really messed up 40 minute version of Rubbber Johnny. Not as much dancing this time though. I'm glad I didn't pay $20 for this. But I'm sure I will watch it again and again. And again. It is brilliant, don't get me wrong. I just was hoping for more. I hope he makes a feature someday (even if it takes 40 or 50 years)."
2,Not What I expected,"I was expecting much more ""dancy"" rythms, instead this was slow and boring. Nice only as ""background"" music...."
3,Hotel Dusk an average game...,Though original in concept and at the outset a compelling game visually there is much to be desired in this game. The story and animation are the only saving features of a game that grows tired and irritating very quickly. The gameplay is very slow even for this genre and involves more character dialogue than forward progress. Puzzles are solved relatively quickly for such longwinded scenarios and the end of chapter tests are quite daunting. you will be craving a quick save when playing. I recommend playing this game one chapter at a time with a backup game close at hand.
2,As fun as reading a book very very slowly,"You can't say the developers didn't put any effort into this game. Unfortunately all the effort went into character and story building and almost none into game play. The puzzles are ridiculously simple. You can't go more than two feet before one of the characters engages you in a lengthy dialogue that you can neither skip nor speed up. When you are talking to the characters you are giving the choice of being a jerk or being annoying. During dialogue you are given a choice of questions to ask, but you have to ask all the questions anyway, so what is the point. It's just one way the game makes you feel like you are actually needed to play it. The rest of the game play is so linear that you can't possibly fail. It actually gives you quizes to make sure you've been paying attention. There is no challenge, no fun, and it will give you a headache. So if you play video games for the sake of reading and not being challenged, enjoy."
3,Not so great,"This is a slow moving,boring game. It isn't very challenging or entertaining. I can't get past the check-in screen because it takes too much time and is so boring."
3,ehhhh,"This game has an interesting premise, but ultimately will bore you to death. The touchscreen controls take all the fun the out of menial tasks such as walking, turning and interacting. The dialog should be the highlight in a game like this, unfortunately it is bogged down with elemantary school level dialect.If you have some serious time on your hands this game may work for you, otherwise I would suggest simply reading an actual novel."
3,Not very Interactive,"If I had wanted to read a story, I would have bought a book. It is dialogue tedious. I will say, the story is a great story and the characters are great, but as a ""game"", not so much. Of all my games, this is my least favorite and I will not play it again."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I read some great reviews on this game; one even came from my favorite (non-biased) electronic gaming magazine. Played it from start to finish and, well... I just expected so much more. My biggest beef was the extremely long dialogues. Play this game if you like the idea of walking around in a small hotel, talking to people over, and over, and over, and over..."
2,Yawn! Beyond boring!,"Sorry, I don't really see how anyone likes this game, it's beyond me to find this entertaining when it's taking forever to get the story going, and I lost interest in the game. It's too boring for me. That's why I rate this 2 stars. Hotel Dusk story itself is not as appealing as other games. The conversations between the detective and the others seem to be taking their sweet time which you can not make the conversations go any faster as you would have like. For example: Phoenix Wright is colorful, comedy, and far more entertaining than this game. Forget this one, go for the series of Phoenix Wright games and it'll be worth every penny."
1,only 4 bowls are included,this product is great but i only got 4 bowls. I expected 8 since it says '8 pieces' but they are counting the lids as pieces. very confusing. but still a great product.
1,Weird Science,"I found the science rather unconvincing, but perhaps I was very skeptical given that the author is also a fundraiser for a U.S. organization that promotes sterilization of people who are, or have ever been, addicted to drugs, which would have prevented the birth of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Jaqueline Kennedy, Dave Eggers (Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius), Frank McCourt (Angela's Ashes), Bill Cosby, John Steinbeck (Grapes of Wrath), etc. Any ""science"" that comes to a conclusion these genetic defectives would have been better off never born due to their alcoholic parent smells like that fish I left in the trash last week."
5,WIN BEAR IS BACK AT LAST!!!!,"A new North American Confederacy novel at last. After a hiatus following THE GALLATIN DIVERGENCE, L. Neil Smith has finally returned to his most popular creation, the alternate world first visited over twenty years ago in his classic novel THE PROBABILITY BROACH. As fate would have it, THE AMERICAN ZONE deals specifically with how a truly free society would handle a spate of terrorist attacks. In the wake on 9-11, the issues LNS deals with are incredibly relevant for Americans today. All our favorite characters return, including Lucy Kropotkin and Will Sanders, plus numerous figures from our own world (or similiar realities) appear under different names. Half the fun is realizing which real-world public figure LNS is skewering under another name. As always, there's plenty of action, lots of laughs, and a fine mystery along with the libertarian philosophy. If you can stand to take your freedoms straight, with no chaser, this is the novel for you! Read and enjoy."
2,Not what I expected,"The remote worked fine for my GE TV and Sanyo VCR. It also did about 85% of what I needed it to do for my Harman-Kardon Receiver. The problem that I had with it though, is that it did not work for my RCA CD player or DVD player. I would not recommend this remote."
3,Not sufficient for positive I.D.,"While this book is fairly informative and useful, it lacks enough information and/or illustration to positively identify mushrooms for forager's consumption."
1,"""FOREIGN DVDS""",MY HUSBAND WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WHEN RECEIVING HIS DVD AND FINDING OUT THAT IT IS ONLY PLAYABLE IN EUROPE AND JAPAN. WHY WASN'T THAT MENTIONED WHEN PURCHASING IT?
4,"Another vintage, must-have book from Ruth Webb Lee.","I was skeptical about the usefulness of this ""handbook"" when I ordered it for $3 but have been really impressed. It contains very little text (the first 5 or 6 pages only) but rather is filled with photos...every page! It's a super book to look for the numerous, assorted, early Boston & Sandwich pieces that don't qualify to be listed in her books about cup plates, etc. I have found it very usefull in identifying several items like 6"" lacy plates and various shallow & deep bowls.Get a good, clean copy if you decide to order it. This is a paperback book so I was careful to confirm that it had a tight binding before ordering. In short...this book reflects the same high quality found in Ruth Webb Lee's other numerous books."
4,Close as it Gets,This book clearly and concisely brings the knowable and the unknowable as close to one another as they can get. The author takes us to the limits of science and understanding at which point the reader must surrender cognitive control and fly by faith. I enjoyed this book and will read other Peter Russell books.
5,Tremendous! Gives hope for the future of civilization!,"I urge anyone interested in bridging gaps between different worldviews to read this book! Peter Russell presents a profound and deep look into essential core issues of our times. Science and spirituality are two of my greatest passions, and in this book the author brings them together in a way far beyond anything I have read to date. My worldview perceptions have been beautifully expanded, and I have been given a glorious glimpse of the potentials of human consciousness that are completely applicable to our new millennium. I recommend this work wholeheartedly! Peter Russell is one of my favorite authors. He brings a brillance and clarity to his books and videos that have deepened my understanding of the world condition and given me hope for the future!"
4,"Great book, false ""title""",Great inside and prespective of the untold story of forgotten units of Marines. However the title is misleading. There were Marine Special Operations/Forces Units in Nam and those were Reconnassaince units not CAP Plts.
1,Bibliography? Nonsense,"One of the great things about books on this subject is the related material that allows you to go more indepth and make your own decisions after an author has raised the issue. This is a slim book -- light weight in more way than one -- and constantly refers to the apparently deep and provocative bibliography ""for further reference."" Alas, this book has no bibliography which demonstrates a degree of carelessness which makes me question the author's general approach to the subject matter.I would not recommend it as it's superficial in dealing with the concept of retreats at the very best and the very frequent references to the non-existent bibliography suggest that the author was aware there was far more to the subject that the reader of this book is cut off from."
3,"Good, but showing its age","This book is an excellent, although brief, exploration of the topic. Unfortunately the book is showing its age. Some of the concepts have proven dated to the point they are non-serviceable. For the pricing, however, the book is an excellent primer, an easy read, and quite useful when complimented by its sequel, ""The Modern Survival Retreat""."
5,Does everything the knife says it could!,I'm amazed at how well this knife does what I need for it to do. I just bought paring knives made by Gordon Ramsey and they don't seem to do as well of a job as the Rada! Will definitely be buying more Rada knives in the future!
2,crap,"well its not very durible as the nose cone broke off on ALL THREE ROCKETS. i definently had to use some corn starch to slip the rockets on better and of course it only went 30ft. until it stalled.the petented thrust bosster wasent very carfully desinged- and of course, IT DIDNT EVEN COME WITH FRIGGIN' INSTRUCTIONS. o ya VERY educational. i learned alot about what not to buy.~chrisdatenyearold"
1,The Great Tomato Book,This is NOT a cookbook. It has a few recepies. Most of the book covers different types of tomatoes and how to grow them.
1,"Bad design, spotty compatibility","Stay away from this one. While it did control my Aiwa shelf system, Sony DVD, RCA VCR, and Philips TV, it only supported some features of each and not others. On my TV menu, it would scroll through menu items one way, but not the other. When controlling the stereo, I also had to press the volume button about 100 times in rapid succession to get the volume knob to inch up just a bit. It also would ""forget"" which mode it was on, meaning I had to press the button for another component and then go back to the one I wanted.Also - REAL bad design. The channel buttons are on the bottom, meaning that many times I had to channel surf using 2 hands because there wasn't enough room to hold the entire remote and press the buttons at the same time."
1,Dont buy this one,"There are much better remotes on the market. I mistakenly purchased this one because of it's claimed functions and it's price tag. It does a poor job of controlling any newer components and seems to be suited for OLD electronics without menu's or navigation controls, and if you have a Dolby Digital Reciever... forget about it... BAD"
3,not what i expected,"this is not good shea butter, not pure, it has a extreme yellow color which you can tell has been mixed with something, came in a plastic bag and very small. i will continue to order my shea butter from [...] Unrefined shea butter will not be brightyellow unless a root dye extract has been added to iti have changed review because i have used on nephew this weekend he is a teenager and he has lost of big pimples on his back and face as well as something on his hand and i applied this shea butter and in 2 days the pimples reduced in size and looks to be drying out healing"
5,Great!,This lotion is great on all skin types and tones. Everyone in my family use it daily. It doesn't dry out your skin and it keeps you moisterized all day it also has last us a very long time. I bought the biggest size they have and after a month it's still going strong.
5,Like it,"I have never had/used pure Shea Butter before, but like this in a lotion recipe I made. Good price, too."
2,"I would get the ""ivory"" shea butter in the future","I didn't realize there was an ivory option, when I bought this. The color itself doesn't bother me, but I used it to make lotion and it stinks really bad. Some people describe a ""nutty"" scent, but it really smells very bad. And it's strong. It also has little bits of shell in it, which apparently the ivory doesn't. It still does the job as far as moisturizing and giving the lotion a decent texture (I don't notice the shell pieces once mixed with beeswax and coconut oil), but it still stinks."
4,good deal,"I am not a connoisseur and so cannot comment on the purity of this product, but it seems like the real deal to me. You get a lot, and it feels & smells great. It comes in plain plastic containers, like take-out tubs--no fancy packaging. I actually put it on my face and throat every night & wake feeling fantastic. (I might not recommend this to someone with less dry skin, though--or someone who doesn't sleep alone! It's pretty greasy.)"
3,its ok,"Ok so first off let me start out by saying that this is NOT shea butter. It is African butter from a totally different part of Africa. I have ordered real shea butter and it is supposed to be white, not yellow. Second, being that this was my first experience with African butter, I would have to say that it wasn't too bad. Its a little more creamy than Real Shea butter and it works well for natural hair. I noticed that it also works well on skin. It has more moisture than real Shea butter. But it was altogether worth the purchase . I gave it a 3 because it's not real shea butter. Someone should really do their research before labeling an all natural product like this."
1,Tried two - both didn't work,"I bought one of these, and it never started. I figured it was a fluke, but after reading how to have it fixed by Stuhrling (cost $20 to ship back, can take weeks to get it back) I decided to return it, and try again. The second one started working as soon as I wound it. But, it loses time. It loses about 5-7 minutes of the course of the day. I'm now returning both watches and will buy from a local store. I was very unhappy to have two watches not work. It is a very nice looking watch too."
4,Beautiful and Deep,I was really surprised by this DVD documentary. I was amazed by all the different ways that people experience both the spiritual and the touching of other worlds. I really enjoyed this but the only downfall was the film definition was a bit grainy to me and I cared nothing about Old Man Gloom.
4,Good Battery,"This is an average battery. It performs as expected. It replaces all CR1620 batteries, not just energizer. I used it in my Timex Ironman Triathlon watch with success. Great price."
2,This is pretty but way overpriced.,"It's a very basic camisole and if you are over 5'5"" tall it will probably be to short for you."
3,A commedy/horror flick,This is a classic B movie commedy/horror movie for the twisted. It is manely dark humor through out the movie and I recomend it to the horror movie watchers.
2,Sometimes It's Not About Horror...,"If you watch this movie in hopes of coming across a truly misunderstood horror gem...then you will be terribly disappointed. The acting is weak, the plot is riddled with holes and was obviously thrown together in five minutes, the make-up and effects (if you can call them that) are just plain silly. But still, this movie is worth watching. Why? Heather Elizabeth Parkhurst and Stella Stevens, of course! Gorgeous and seductive, Parkhurst is lovely to look at, and with her cheesy one-liners and badly applied make-up, Stella Stevens is hilarious! Highlights include the wrestling addicted nephew and the ""Melting scene"" of Wolfgang the Cat. Seriously."
1,Poor,"For something like this to work, it must be the highest quality image, full screen, and interesting to look at. This was just junk. I work in video, was trained in video arts when I went to art school, and can tell you that this video is without creativity, without imagination, and it is certainly bad art. If you can find a video called ""By Design"" by a company called Colorcalm,you will see what a collection of great video artists are capable of doing. This video has a series of gorgeous and subtle video 'chapters', each one like a beautiful moving abstract painting. I've wanted to buy this for all my friends, but I can't seem to find even one other copy. Meanwhile, save your money on this video. I looked at this for a couple minutes, and then through it out."
1,"Don't buy this, it's not endorsed by Gaye Bykers On Acid","As a previous reviewer has already pointed out, tracks 1-7 are recorded from the vinyl of the first two EPs- badly. The rest are demos for Drill Your Own Hole. The sound quality is apalling and the songs are not even finished and have never been approved for release. If you want to find previously unreleased GBOA material, have a look on Ebay, there are lots of new live recordings on there. Don't buy this, the band have been ripped off here and so will you be if you buy it."
2,NOT BAD,I have had the bike for three weeks now. The gearing has fallen apart already cost me 35.00 to get fixed and only beacause i did the work myself. But otherwise a good beginner bike.
2,Please shop at a Bike Shop!,"Please go shopping in a bike shop. I bought on Amazon thinking to save some money. In the end, it is costing me money. Bikes are amazingly complicated machines and difficult to assemble. I failed to tighten the petal sufficiently and it fell off in a week, having ruined a piece of the bike. Price at a bike shop to get it all fixed up--55 dollars. So please, spend the little extra at a bike shop and save yourself both money and frustration. You will be thankful you did."
2,"Party on...or study on, depending...","So, according to this guide every school must be either...a) A ""party school"" where the students are inebriated a greater percentage of the time than they spend in class. It turns out that the tuition and board at these schools are merely cover charges for the four years of parties and jam-band concerts. Chances are you'll miss the majority of your classes due to hangovers, so don't even bother with the academics.orb) A ""nerd school"" where the social life is defined by the number of people in your study group. Forget parties and fun at these schools kids, it's off to the library...Did we mention the lackluster ""male to female ratio""...funny, considering they mention that for an all-male school...Use this in conjuction with another guide such as Barrons or Fiske, and take everything with a grain of salt."
3,Due to the voice only 3 stars,"Hi,day by day i need two hours in my car to drive to work. so the time could be used to listen to the bible. I am not a native speaker but I was fascinated by the New Living Translation - very clear translated also to non native speakers. So i ordered the audio version. Starting with Matthew soon i was very disappointed. I expected a clear voice - but this voice sounds not clear - too much deep vibrations and to much American styled. Even my daughter which is able to translate immediately every text of English songs had problems to follow the reading. Additionally it should be a little bit slower.So one of the best English translation cannot light up due to the voice used.It's a pity."
1,Poor Continuity,"For those of you who read and are familiar with the Battletech Universe may want to think twice before getting this one. The plot is decent, but suffers from a lack of connection. It has little relevance to the overall Battletech picture. Characters are not well developed; and there is a type of ""sing-song"" quality to the pregression. It's predigested candy for a true Battletech reader."
3,Great Book.,"This is the third book that I own.Rose reminded me of a long lost friend.[she not him]This book is a great book, but not what I call a must read.If you are into the RPG side of battletech then I would say that this a must read.A great storyline to follow."
2,Unrealistic,This book is a bad joke by an author who seems to suffer from Monty Haul symptoms. He does have some writing skills (hence two stars) but his grip on universe realism is appaling. Omnimechs maintained by mechwarriors with the skills of astechs? Asinine plans by washed up Nova Cats to stealthily strike at the Combine capital? And of course the infamous getaway with two companies worth of Omnimechs. Whoopie... And to top it all off he just has to write the main characters as touchy feely types who feel so bad about all this fighting. Oh the humanity!
3,"Great food, but accurate?","I've had this book forever.I cooked out of it for years and then in my last move, lost the book. I came across it again recently. With me being on weight watchers, the nutritional information is really handy....or is it? I have found several of the recipies to be way under the actual calories and fat.It's still a really awesome little book, but if you are concerned about the nutritional information, you may want to double check the values."
3,Dated but interesting,"This is much better than Freud's book about humor and wit. Here he shares some interesting ideas about humor. But humor doesn't seem to cross time zones. Something funny in 1900 may not be in 2013. Peter Berger has a much better social science understanding of humor. I suggest looking him up instead of reading Freud on humor or watching the Allan King's VHS (not yet in DVD), The College of Comedy where he interviews Tim Conway, Buddy Hackett, Paul Rodriquez, or Judy Gold. Or watch the masters, Richard Pryor, Charles Chaplin, Louie C.K. I wonder what Freud would have thought of them."
2,"Grainy, horrible color reproduction","Pros:- It's dirt cheap.- Nice, bright color contrastCons:- The grain is not smooth at all. If you're looking for photos that look 30 years old, get this film. It looked like I had applied one of those horrible Instagram filters to my scans.- The film had a real blue shift to it. I had to work hard to correct the color, but I would not recommend this film unless you're shooting people or other very warm subjects. The colors are very vibrant, they're just very cold and blue.Overall: I got this film off of a discount rack, and maybe it had been sitting in heat at some point. It had an expiration date of mid-2013, so it had plenty of time left. I found it to give very polaroid-y results. If that's what you're looking for, you'll get it with this film. It was used in my Canon AE-1 P, which I usually keep stocked with BW film or Fuji color film."
4,"5-Star item!! I thought I hate the stainless steel handle, but NOT AT ALL!!","<Updated on 10/07/2007> I got several very nice Trudeau spatulas, but I end up using this one all the time!! I found it's very easy to use and easy to clean! Surprisingly, I LOVE it!! HA~HA~~ Now I wish I can give it a 5-star!! The system won't allow me to change the rating!<The initial review> I have to admit that this is a Good spoon as the silicone is firm and the spoon is very easy to work with. But, with metal handle, I can only use it to scrape the batter off the mixing bowls. The metal handle gets hot if you stir the hot pot for a while. Definitely, I can't leave it on the cooking pot for even a little while, or it will get really hot! This thing is about 11-1/4 long, easy to clean. However, compare to this one, I still love my yellow Trudeau Silicone Spatula more!"
3,More opinion than training manual,This is an essay on the authors opinion about the current training methods. It is interesting and I agree with many of his points; but if you are looking for training material look elsewhere.
3,LAS VEGAS VIDEO POSTCARD UNBALANCED,"After a recent trip to Las Vegas I was hoping to purchase a video that would cover the whole experience, historical and current, in a uniform and informative way. This video postcard skims through things so quickly it hardly provides insight into anything. It spends a long time dealing with every aspect of the Luxor Hotel then spends twenty seconds on the huge and sprawling MGM Grand, never even mentions the Mirage, and speeds through the demolitions so quickly one hardly knows what's happening. IT's better than nothing, but one wonders if Luxor paid for the thing to be made."
4,its great,"Tony instructs tricks very clearly and shows them over and over again. there is much, much more about the video. If you like to skateboard and you are good at it this is the movie for you."
3,buy it for the Etta James cover alone,"This disc has both hits and misses. Not surprisingly I like the covers of the songs that I don't particularly care for Janis' version of. ""What good can Drinking Do"" and ""Down on Me"", but the real reason to buy this disc is for one of the greatest Etta James vocals you'll ever hear, her cover of ""Ball and Chain""."
2,Not sure this does anything...better to brew your own,"I've made my own essiac before and used other extracts. I just couldn't tell that this did anything for me - I didn't notice any benefit from this version. From now on, I will brew my own."
1,don't bother!,"This DVD is a big time rip off! ""8"" of the songs are from the concert (ONE NIGHT ONLY) the quality is terrible to say the least. The last ""7"" songs are not even from this concert, the title (BEE GEES THE BEST OF & FRIENDS LIVE)makes it sound like they are in the concert singing with the Bee Gees and it is very missleading, the songs are from other videos that are on other DVDs, what a joke. I think it is fair to say that this is some kind of copie and not an offical release DVD. Live by request, One For All and One Night Only are the best Bee Gees live concerts. I hope this helps."
2,Recoton TV2000,"This antenna did not work at all for me. I only received 1 channel and that was full of snow. The antenna is not made very well. The only connector kept on falling off, and a call to there CS dept. was really no help at all. They offered to replace it at my expense, and that it would take 4-6 weeks to get a new one. I would choose a different brand."
2,the Bach doesn't fit,"It was a terrible marketing decision to use the Bach Cello Suites as a filler for the other modernistic pieces that they were coupled with in this ECM New Series featuring Thomas Demenga. The liner notes go to great lengths to sell the buyer on the ties that bind the Bach to the 20th century composers but it sounds more like begging than explaining. The Zimmerman, the Hosokawa, Yun, Verese, Holliger and Carter pieces need to be collected together on a series of recordings and the Bach either jettisoned or sequestered. Maybe someday a re-release will save what's good about this series and reduce 6 mediocre CD recordings down to what should be 3. Buy the Bach elsewhere--there are over a dozen great choices."
5,SUPERB DANCE SEQUENCES AND A GOOD PLOT,THIS FILM IS VERY ENTERTAINING AND WORTH BUYING. THE PLOT CONCERNS A BALLET DANCER WHO GETS BACK IN RUSSIA (HE DEFECTED FROM THERE) WHEN THE PLANE HE'S ON MAKES AN EMERGENCY LANDING. HE IS THEN BULLIED BY A KGB AGENT. HE JOINS FORCES WITH A DANCER TO GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
3,For Baryshnikov's fans only.,"Sometimes I wonder why Baryshnikov does these movies. This is not as good as Turning Point, and much better than Dancers. But there are some fun moments all the same. One classic moment is when the babushka watching the door gives Baryshnikov the ok to move using just her eyes. Helen Mirren is the best thing in this movie, her character is partly based on the real-life Irina Kolpakova, who guaranteed Baryshnikov's return to the Soviet Union in 1974 from Canada!"
3,...back in the USSR...,"I agree with most reviews that say this story is a little thin on the plot,but still an interesting way to spend the afternoon. Helen Mirren and Geraldine Page manage to lift it slightly... but only just.Skolomwski does a wonderful nasty turn as the KGB point man. I liked the dance sequences best although at the differences in style Baryshnikov appears slightly more aesthetic...Hines seems to struggle to hold centre stage. Predictable ending."
4,Great Dancing.,Marvellous to be able to see Barishnikov at his best and Hines with his tap dancing is unbelieveable to watch.
5,oh ~what memories!!!,"Well, I was lucky enough to get one of the last cheap vhs copys of this on amazon,and boy am I glad I did.~~~Live at camden palace in '85 the set list is all of the early works from warlock but the sound and video is top notch (considering the date and source).Doro's vocals are spot on and not too shabby axe playing from the dual guitarists.I own quite a few concert dvd's (dio, maiden, dokken, led zep,etc., but I've transferred this from vhs to dvd ,and it will now sit proudly among its music dvd friends."
4,Good travel book,"Its not customary for me to address another's review, but I actually find this book very helpful in the times that I have traveled to Mallorca. It is complete with many phone numbers (for ferries, flights, etc) and provides great sections on restaurants and festivals. My only issue with the book is the lack of a historical foundation for the island itself and some more indepth history of the featured monuments."
3,Get the Live CD Instead,"Dee has a powerful voice, and when it's unproduced, it's magical. As you can see by the reviews, many of her fans fell in love with her music during a live show. This CD, done in the studio, is a combination of clear, beautiful cuts, and overproduced pop-sounding songs. Get her live CD instead: Home Away From Home. You won't regret it."
4,Good product.,"My daughter loves this thing! For the most part it was easy to put up. We've had to make a few adjustments, trying to get the wire tight enough for it to work its best but it hasn't been too difficult. I would definitely recommend it."
3,Great for a while but then wore out,This was great for the first year but after that the plastic pulleys began to degrade and eventually the cable slowly dug into them making this unusable. For the current price I would recommend spending the extra money to get a zip line that has metal pulleys that will last longer than a year. I like things that last longer that this did.Otherwise the kids loved it while it lasted.
5,our kids love it!,"This is our second cable ride. Our first purchase lasted about 10 years. You will love watching your children increase strength, endurance and flexibilty on this ride. We tied a soft rope to it so kids can pull the cable 'car' to the high point. The ride is to be used by kids under 100 lbs, but I know that bigger kids got on it and it still lasted 10 years."
4,"Great, but not perfect","I had this system installed for my two young kids. I chose a wireless system after hearing SpongeBob 5 million times in our previous vehicle. At first I thought it was the greatest system, but I learned you have to be careful with the headphones. Kids tend to be rough and after about a year I had to replace one set of headphones and after two years I'm having to replace the other. It is a great system and the photo memory card viewer is a neat feature allowing you to view your pictures on your way home instead of waiting. Also, if you purchase this system, or any other with wireless headphones, get used to travelling with batteries in your glove box. There's nothing worse than only one child with headphones. Hope this helps!"
1,"Trashy, trashy","An interesting story, but obviously very one sided. The author comes acrossas perhaps less than honest about some details of her life, & you can't help feeling that her loyalty to & strident support of Paula Yates was in the end unhelpful.It rather left me feeling like I needed a boiling hot shower! Don't waste your money."
5,Good brush,I have had this brush for at least a year now. It is still in perfect shape and was worth the price. It is my favorite brush and I think it is really nice looking.
5,Hooray!,"I was glad to find this - I had a cassette, but a player ruined the tape - now I have the CD and it sounds beautiful = love it!"
4,That is what you get...,erm.. That is what you get.4 Different sized pieces of plastic for placing over your microwaveable's to stop splatter but lets steam vent out.They can also be used for many things like covering dishes outside and before dinner so they stay warm..
3,A little advice,"I just received this Transport and am mildly unhappy with it. For those of you who might not have thought of it, here is a little advice: Check and see where your buttons are (play, ff, rewind) and then look at the picture of the case with the cd player in it. Guess where my buttons are? I have the Koss player with the tranparent blue lid. Yup, buried under the snap lock and the nylon sheeth. It seems of pretty good quality, but the loops are a little tight on mine and you can already guess where it's going to wear out but that's just conjecture. There's a tiny zipper pocket in it, that looks like it might hold 2 AA batteries and some keys (off the keyring) and that's about it. All in all, not a bad idea - we'll see how well it serves it's purpose. Add a star if your buttons are accessible."
1,Based on a misunderstanding of principle,"A valiant effort, but an attempt to steal the thunder of a Purpose Driven Life. Virtually unreadable..I could not finish it.The authors do not seem to truly grasp the authors they quote or the New Thought ideas that they are attempting to relay."
3,Good and disappointing,"One of the great things of these sort of glasses should be they are real canning jars with handles to drink from. Apparently they are not. The telling fact? They state ""not for hot liquids"". You boil canning jars, so they should handle hot liquids fine, but these do not. Really sad. Great for iced tea, tho."
3,"quick, entertaining read","I enjoyed it for the locker room-style banter in the bookie rooms and the offbeat characters like Krause and Monkey and Bernie. The love story is a distraction but the book is a true story, not a novel, and sometimes there is no resolution in real life. A good read overall. I'm going to read his other memoir on the world series of poker."
2,Made Me Sick,This particular pill was way too much for my system. I only tried it three times and each time I was sick for a day afterwards with severe headaches and vomiting. I am not sure why it did not mix with my system but I discarded the rest of the box.
2,not my favorite,"It's somewhere to sit I guess if you're on level ground, the back support is better than a 3 legged stool, but I would recommend the camp type chair before buying this. It's noisy, awkward to carry and not very stable to sit in. I decided to keep it because return shipping would be as much as the chair, but I usually grab the 3 legged stool for my blind hunting instead of this."
1,Horrible - don't buy this machine,"First and most importantly......I HATE this Vacuum.I dread vacuuming, something I did not dread before THIS Vacuum.It is worthless. I spent a lot of money on this thing because my last vacuum wasa Hoover. Never again! I cannot afford a new vacuum right now so I am stuck stuck stuck.Our dog is shedding and it will not pick up the dog hair. I am getting so angry right now just thinkingabout how much I hate the vacuum. Please don't buy this vacuum. Don't waste your money."
4,good book!,very eye opening. I hope it will increase my effectiveness and it has increased my awareness.
5,great for the entitlement generation :),This book helps illustrate that we all own our own destiny and can change how we think and react to become better employees and leaders. A strong read for everyone.
2,Remote,"I have tried to get the remote to work as advertised and followed the instructions but so far nothing. I have to manually press the button, very frustrating."
2,nihilism? it's more like romantic tragedy,"A mention in some article about nihilism directed me to this book, and the ""about"" seemed promising.Well, this is the wrong kind of nihilism.Maybe I read too much of the Stoics recently, but the characters feel like unstable crybabies plagued by boredom and, as the original French name suggests, by the ""extension of the domain of the struggle"" into sexual sphere, the struggle in which they are losers. They see nothing (nihil?), and they are very unhappy about it. All thru the book. Sometimes they are sad, sometimes they lapse into fight-club-esque behavior, sometimes they are suicidal, but whatever they are, they are not any philosophical or intellectual - the book is all about emotions.I derived nothing from this book, although it does make for a somewhat entertaining easy reading."
2,Whatever was that about,"Having read and enjoyed previous Houellebecq books (particularly the possibilities of an island) I was astonished by the banal, boring, mundane trot through some losers life that this book is. Do yourself a favoure and what emerdale for five hours - it will be a more enriching and educating experience."
3,Whatever,tomorrw is today bt not yesturday and today I want some cheese with PICKLES. I love pickles and they love me as they told me that they do. I'm not going mad as I know that the pickles really did speak to me. they are my only friends
4,AMG Review,"The second album from this accomplished young group features a majority of strong original material, led by banjoist Graham Sharp, whose best contributions are the lovely harmony piece ""Hibriten Mountain"" and the humorous ""Money Out of Sand."" ""Knob Creek"" is a wonderfully forlorn instrumental piece built around Mike Guggino's mandolin, and bassist Charles Humphrey supplies the car-crash drama ""Norma Jean."" Perhaps the most striking thing about the Steep Canyon Rangers is their restraint - they exude a naturalness in their playing that is remarkable for such a young group, and the fact that they play within their limits deserves extra applause. Each note is well placed, each song fully realized, and with five strong vocalists, their harmonies (especially on the beautiful ""Good Old Country Baptizing"") are among the warmest in bluegrass.Jim Smith - All Music Guide"
2,Informative...but boring,"When I began this course, I felt lucky that I had already had a lot of experience in the world of e-commerce, just because I had problems paying attention to the book when I was reading it. I found myself doing two things at the same time in order to retain any of the information in it. It has a lot of information - but it's presented in an extremely boring manner. I put off reading quite a few chapters until the day before my final exam. The only thing of any interest were the case studies at the beginning of each chapter."
4,Good Product at Good Price,"I've had it for 6 months without a problem. It's a good product at a good price. Nothing extravagant, just a nice simple headset."
2,Boring!!,This dvd did nothing for me. I have had a better workout using kettlebell workouts on online websites that were more intense and made me feel like I was actually working out and burning calories. I didn't even break a sweat doing any of the routines in this dvd. I was very disappointed and think I may send it back and get a more intense workout dvd program.
5,Good dvd,Amy does a great job instructing and teaching good form. this is a great dvd for kettlebell Beginners. i got this to integrate change in my workouts.
5,As relevant today as when it was written,"While I've heard about this book for years, I didn't read it until after watching the Lifetime movie that was based on the book. In a society that is still struggling to treat LGBT people with dignity and decency, this book is an important resource. Far too many gay teens are being driven to despair, substance abuse, homelessness, and suicide by rejecting families. I hope the Lifetime movie will lead many viewers to read this important book."
5,Good book!,"I watched the movie prior to reading the book. Usually, the books always better than the movie, but in this case ... The movie was better. All in all, it's a great story!"
2,caveats,"The music is reasonably good, and the band puts on a fantastic live show. Sadly, the lyrics are way off the beaten path, incorporating rhetoric from the band's Scientology beliefs."
3,Contains Lead?,"It does its job.It's made of plastic and has a button that you have to push with your thumb which is slightly awkward.My biggest complaint is that there is a small sticker on the cable stating that it ""contains lead, wash hands after use"". You'd think that something as simple as this could be made without lead, but you gotta cut production costs somewhere right?"
1,Actron CP7527 Inductive Timing Light,"This Actron CP7527 Inductive Timing Light is Such...I use it for 2 times and it stoped working,I rate this Product one Star.Actron CP7527 Inductive Timing Light"
5,Good Little Timing Light,If you're looking for a simple (No Bells & Whistles) Induction Timing Light this is the light for you. Just make sure you use gloves while using it cause the instruction manual mentioned that there's Lead in the cables and to wash your hands after use?!?! =O
1,another corporation screws you,"Everyone else is right. These filters are virtually impossible to find and I can't get any response from KitchenAid. It's sad because this was one of the best coffee makers I've purchased in a long time. Now that I need a filter though, KitchenAid won't stand behind thier product. What a waste."
1,The Publishers Weekly Review is Dead On!,"Clearly the author of this book has contempt for the films of Robert Zemeckis. Then why the hell did he write the book! I am sure there are many others who would have at least written an an unbiased look at Zemeckis's films. Also there is alot inaccurate information and quotes from the particular films. It seems like the author was incorrectly remembering the films after seeing them many years before. He feels that because Bob is such a genius at the tech. of film making, then his films must be shallow and have no real meaning. I don't agree with this all. The signatures of Bob's films are that they are full of real heart and overflowing with ideas that make you think. If you are a fan of Robert Zemeckis or would like a fair look at his work, don't waste your money on this."
4,Surfers & Street Racers,"Great collection of great songs. The good old days when Huntington Beach, California was Surf City and drive-in restaurants throughout the United States were pit areas for street-racers.Friday nights at the local burger joint as '55 and '56 Chevys line up, 327/375hp fuel-injected engines roaring and rumbling through open headers. Rear ends jacked up as street tires are replaced with racing slicks.The 60s before the Viet-Nam War, social protesting, and the psychedelic sounds from San Francisco. Enjoy those good times before war destroyed the USA.Surf City: Best of Jan and Dean is a better album but for the money this is a bargain and certainly an inexpensive way to load your MP3 player. All the songs are great. So, grab this album. It's fun, fun, fun."
4,Amazing mix of mind-expanding soundscapes and tight lyricsm.,"I went out and bought this cd a few months after really getting into Swollen Members and the BattleAxe Warriors...and all I can say is that I was blown away. DJ Murge is affiliated with both Eclipse and BattleAxe Records, most known for his trippy beats. From the opening track ""Search and Rescue"" by Abstract Rude to the last, ""Up and Up"" by LMNO, Murge is on point, creating soundscapes that you can get lost in, rather than just bass 'n' drum beats. This album features cuts by the Living Legends and Mystik Journeymen crews, and, of course, the BattleAxe Warriors. Some of the cuts do start off slow and take a couple of listens to really get into, but I assure you that this album is worth every single penny. I give this album 4 stars.Standout tracks are ""Shake 'Em Down"" by Son Doobie, ""Chewing Concrete"" by Swollen Members, ""Got the Get"" by Jeff Spec, and ""Drown in the Mainstream"" by Sunspot Jonz."
4,Well made!,"Perfect size for a smaller counter top. Beautiful look and very sturdy. Only slight downfall, is the wood is a bit rough, making it a little harder to wipe down with a cloth. Almost, seems like there should be a coating of something on it to make it smoother. Still love it though."
3,The Modern Pilgrims Travel Guide,"One of my top things to do on my ""fantasy list"" is to visit every sacred site listed in this informative book. I love the lay-out and ease of use of most ""DK"" books. This book is particularly interesting in that it gives a fairly decent summary of each holy site. It is a good beginning guide and may help to ""spur"" interest in a particular area that you can then delve more deeply into at a later time. However, I thought they could have given a bit more information on some of the English sites. They also tended to focus mainly on pagan sites."
2,A Long somewhat boring sermon,"The Prisoner in the Third Cell was more of a long sermon based on our disappointments in how God handles events in life....or rather doesn't handle them. Disappointment in the book was largely due to not personally feeling disappointment in God personally. But for those who have not reached that stage in life this may be a good read. ""The Shack"" is a much better story for those looking to possibly understand God better."
3,Dramatization of John the Baptist,A short dramatization of John the Baptist's life and how he had to overcome so many emotions and feelings surrounding his ministry and his life with Jesus. The author closes by pointing out how much we have in common with John and how we also need to deal with those emotions and feelings.
5,Great Story,This was a very well written story on one of my favorite people from the Bible. It offers a great new prespective on John the Baptist. It is a fairly quick read but is a powerfull story.
4,This record is definitly worth buying,"This is a very good cd that near miss has put out. They are a great band and everyone should buy this cd. It is very much like bigwig, having a mix of harder and softer more poppier songs. Its is a very good and i reccomend it."
4,great family fun,My little cousin has watched this tittle 6 times. He knows it line for line. It has a good story line. I will buy this video. Wish it was out on DVD.
3,Too many specialists!,"There are 8 reviewers before me, after listening to whom I purchased this CD, primarily based on the favorable comments on Gil Shaham. I have now listened to the CD and am quite disappointed. Being a live performance there are limitations to recording - the violin is far too back to be heard in all the beauty of Shanan's playing and the orchestral sound appears like a monolithic mass without tranparency. This is unlike most of DG's recordings offered nowadays which are sonically very transparent and pleasing. Nonetheless, in all the aforesaid reviews, the reviewer prefers another performance. No one says ""Recommended""! I prefer the Vengerov recording myself."
1,QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST MOUSE IN THE HISTORY OF ALL MICE!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE!This mouse has given me nothing but frustration.1. The front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low, causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time.2. Battery life is horrible. Like 2 weeks...3. When your mouse is idle for 8 minutes, it goes into an automatic sleep mode. The manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to ""revive"" it but when I do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen. So I have to reboot my computer.Absolutely the worst!!!"
1,This mouse is terrible,"I got this mouse because it is small and easy for travel, however it has many technical difficulties. The battery cover is complicated and hard to remove, the usb reciver blinks when ever you use the mouse, the off/on button is very small and frustrating, and much more. overall....DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE AND WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Loses connection and poor tracking. Don't buy.,"Pretty much crap. I got it with a new laptop, thinking I would be saving myself trouble over the touchpad. I find I use the touchpad more than the mouse. I've grown accustom to trying the mouse and have it not work. When I do get it to work the tracking is poor and jerky. It's hard to cut and past text. Go elsewhere and save the headache."
1,Not worth it,I bought this and returned it the same day. The scrolling wheel worked intermittently at best. It also had a problem when I moved the cursor diagonally. The battery cover is flimsy as others have stated. I almost snapped it in two while trying to put batteries in it. Another annoying feature is that the USB module has an obnoxious bright blue light that blinks continuously.
3,Its okie for the price,"When i got this mouse, it took me almost an hour to make this mouse work in my Windows XP environment. The document is insufficient (both on the box and website) as it does not explain how to configure the mouse for the first time when the receiver is plugged into the system. there is a tiny reset button on the receiver which needs to reset after pluging this device to the system for the first so that it recognizes the wireless mouse and this button is not easily noticeable for the first time unless you thoroughly look into it. The lack of documention from targus pissed me of as i have to google the information for almost an hour. I believe lack of proper documentation is the reason i find lot of people are not able to configure this device for the first time and they have to return it back. otherwise i did not have any problems as other reviewers and i have been using this for few days at home and work without any problem."
5,"Great price, bright color","I bought this for an optic cordless mouse for my imac. It works great, is not super thin and is a bright cheery blue color. Best of all it was very reasonably priced, including delivery and it arrived on time."
2,What's enhancing about this?,"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this but the word enhancing made me think it must be better quality than the thin pads I buy at the Dollar Store. So far, I haven't found it's enhanced qualities except the price. It does the job but nothing special about it."
4,Full-length long programs,"I disagree with the other 2 reviewers. You don't buy videos just to have nice chapters, but rather to watch the performances; who cares about fast fowarding? This set has the complete long programs--without commentary--of many skaters, even hard-to-find perfomances like those from the 1980s and earlier. The only snippets are of those of Dick Button, Debi Thomas and Sonja Henie. The quality of the video is very good, and the music is clear. My main criticism is the lack of Russians included in the collection; it's mostly North Americans. I'd also have liked more pairs & ice dancers. But overall, it's a nice collection for skating fans, and allows you to see the changes in the sport over the last few decades."
1,WARNNING!!!,"The bike came in and looked really good. Once my step son took it for a ride he said the breaks didnt work nor did the speed changer & it was making sounds. I took it to the bike shop and ended up paying over 70 bucks cause they had to rebend a tire and said it was put to gether all wrong! The bike came allready put to gether pretty much I just had to put on the seat and the handlbars. The Bike Shop said that the breaks need to be switched, I would of had no clue! WHAT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,dvdrightnow,"Let's get this movie on DVD. I remember this one as a kid my self. As one who was fascinated with Tree Houses and Scooters, this was an inspiration to me. I'd love for my children to see this one."
4,Shorter than original - but works fine,"the unit was a tad shorter than the original - 1/2"" +/-, but it fit right onthe threaded housing with no problems. I do not think the shorter style is a problem.I will but it again, and I would recomend it"
4,Good Reference Material,"This tape is very ""rich"" with information and techniques. There is a lot of information to dissect in this tape and it bears multiple viewings. It is not for someone without a martial arts background after the fist 5 minutes. This video is a good reference for people that have a background in Jeet Kune Do or Wing Chung, escrima, and knowledge of the human pressure points. Features that I particularly liked are:* Demonstrating how the short stick can be substituted by a folding knife or a small flash light (practicle)* Joint locks and take downs* Attacking the pressure points* Multiple striking options after the initial contact* Examples of free flowing drills"
3,Sentimental Journey,For me the book was just o k. I became bored before the end of it and deleted it before the end.
5,Another good read.,I this an interesting book. The way the charactors story line is portrayed and how they interact and come together in the end was very interesting.
2,Just don't get this book at all,"Trying to figure out what is the best term in describing this book: disjointed, loosely put together, or no logical thread between the pages? Honestly, I cannot figure out WHAT the author is trying to convey...are these random (emphasis on random) stories or musings from her father or is it fiction? Where does one chapter end and the other begin? Sometimes a story thread goes along for a few chapters, to be picked up several pages away, with something else completely different in between.I just don't get this."
3,This Version Doesn't Seem To Work Together!,"Canned Heat has continued to endure over the years despite several lineup changes. On this latest release, drummer de la Parra, who has been a member of Canned Heat since 1967, dusts off the bands name and assembles a new version of the Heat with guests, Roy Rogers, Corey Stevens, Walter Trout, Taj Mahal and John Lee Hooker. The result is a mediocre release that does not quite capture the heyday of the original Canned Heat. Even the remakes of ""Let's Work Together"" and ""Getaway"" lack the magic of the original releases. The band seems to be relying on fan loyalty or name ID to garner sales. This appears evident by the decision to also include an early version of ""Let's Work Together"" performed by Harvey Mandel and Little Wheel featuring John Lee Hooker. Overall, considering some of the legendary hits release by the Heat over the years, this one is far from satisfying."
1,very disappointed,"It was used for a car alarm. Purpose of the battery, to power up a small, light duty remote control to open and close the car door. It worked a couple of days. Then, it started working intermittently. I was about to purchase a new remote control. Good thing, I replaced the battery with a new with refresher date. No problem since. CHECK THE DATE on the battery."
5,"Cheap, works good and lasts long.",The battery arrived on time. I use it for my GE wireless bell and it is performing well. I still have one left over for later.
5,Great batteries,I bought these to replace the old batteries in my viper alarm remotes. Worked great so far. No problems. Thanks!!
4,great,they did what they are suppose to do and the price was right. And I have a limited place to shop
5,Good battery for a good price,"These batteries are good quality, and the price was better than in store. Shipping was fast."
5,Nice Battery at a good price,"The Energizer A23, 12 Volt battery works perfectly in my 13 year old Subaru car remotes. The battery arrived quickly and was super-fresh with a best-by date three years out. Sweet."
4,A Real Deal,These batteries worked just fine right out of the package and a lot cheaper than what we priced locally. Batteries were used in our remote control for the ceiling fan.
1,Like a big lemon with little juice,"This book tries to impress but the truth is that it is rather basic. You have to read lots of pages with information that is pretty obvious before you get some juice out of it. I prefer Live and Work in Spain and Portugal, by Victoria Pybus and Joshua White. It is much more to the point. It does not waste your time with irrelevant prose."
2,Not what I was looking for,"Perhaps this book is more for a student's gap year abroad, not for the older person who is thinking of buying property and working in another country. To tell the truth, I found this book wastes lots of pages stating the obvious and patronising the reader. I have found a more adult book with more useful information in Harvey Holtom, Working and Living: Portugal. I would recommend this one instead."
4,Nice quick workout,This video was exactly what I wanted. It is a nice quick workout for the legs when tou're pressed for time. I also do what I remember of the routine with weights when I'm at the gym pressed for time as well. I really like Tamilee's workouts in general.
1,clips clips....... just clips,"when you look at the track listing,how can you not you buy this dvd?However when you pop it in,it doesnt take long to find out,that its just a collection of clips,no complete songs.This dvd could have been amazing with the amount of material they have. However they chose to show 10 second clip of great song,interrupted by bald rock n roll critic explaining me the significance of what i was seeing.Rock n Roll high school 101. Save your money or buy a concert video."
2,Bauer is a Charlatan,"This book is pervaded by typos and poor diction. More significantly, it contains mostly plagiarism and shameless filler. Bauer surreptitiously regurgitates Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren's How to Read a Book; all of the ""how to"" parts of Bauer's book and the advice on better reading can be found in Adler and Van Doren's book, and they explain it better.Aside from a barrage of trivial tangents, most of the rest of this book is dedicated to brief bios of authors and summaries of their masterpieces (with spoilers)--there is no reason to read this if you have access to Wikipedia and a list of the people and books considered most important.Don't waste your time--just start reading the classics and keep at it.And to sum up all the advice on how to read: just don't kid yourself--if you can't explain to someone what you have read, you didn't understand it and should read again more carefully."
4,Decent...not great,"Yes. It's one big, elaborate, exhaustively documented ""yo mama"" joke, complete with charts, graphs, diagrams, and even a family tree. The humor consists mainly of surreally oblique non-sequiturs and general oddness. The concept is actually funnier than the text itself; I found myself laughing more at the names of the chapters than at the jokes therein.Still, it's an amusing read - just be aware that it's more likely to produce wry grins than fits of hysterical laughter."
1,Monroe Strut-Mate Boot Kit,The original boot and the top spring isolator are all one piece. I was not replacing the spring isolator and returned these parts because they did not seem to be compatible with the original spring isolator.
3,Don't understand the hype.,"..I've given this a listen to about 5-6 times now and can't understand the fuss. While there are some great tracks on the album like Melatonin and Lazy Eye I find most of the album just sounds so contrived and has a lack of originality. Similarities to Smashing Pumpkins are obvious but in this day and age of musical regurgitation that doesn't bothers me. What did bother me was the contrived and cringe-worthy lyrics..it just sounded like an ""I'm too cool 15 year old"" singing in front of the mirror..."
4,"If you love the Smashing Pumpkins, you'll love Silversun Pickups",They're kinda like there little brothers and sister.... Very refreshing though....
4,A Solid Album,"I find myself listening to this album all the way through without skipping around. I can't say I love every song but I like each enough not to skip past it. There are some definite gems on this album as well. Melatonin, Well Thought Out Twinkles, Little Lover's So Polite, Lazy Eye: All 5 stars in my book."
1,item arrived cracked,"Cannot know if the item condition was other than described, or if damage was sustained en route to me, but it was damaged when opened. Disappointing."
1,OH MY! Save your money!!!!! YECH!!!!,"The songs are crap, and they are mostly taken off scratchy 78's! VERY deceptive packaging. Morrissey does not sing on any track! Why ANYONE would want this, at this stage of Morrissey's career is BEYOND me!"
2,Not That Great,"For those who are searching for some real answers to the dilemmas involved in Borderline personality Disorder, you won't find too much in this book. IMBROGLIO, by Cauwels, is a much better book. Better than this one or STOP WALKING ON EGGSHELLS.This book tends to skim over the surface, doesn't really portray the experience of the disorder, doesn't seem able to enter the reality of either the patient or the patient's family members. Psychotherapeutic drugs are discussed a little. But I wouldn't rate this book very highly."
3,Disappointing . . .,"I loved the first season's soundtrack. The second season had some great songs too. But, this third season has fallen short of expectations. Although there are a handful of songs that I love I don't listen to this volume nearly as much as the others."
4,So delicious...,Man if that wasn't a ten lb bag I would have finished it all. I got tired of them after a while. If only if there's a way they can remove the candy sprinkles.
3,Tray does not work well,Some times the robot arm have a problem picking up the DVD. I think that the tray should not be so open without a guide around it to keep the Media at a steady location because it seems as if it move out of place while writing.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Buyer beware. You pay $1 for the battery and $5 shipping PER item. You can buy this more cheaply locally.If you buy 3 of these batteries you will pay $3 for the batteries and a whopping $15 for shipping. The company will even ship the items using regular mail and in the same envelope - something that would cost them less than $1.Also keep in mind that if you order multiple items from Amazon, as I did, and they come from multiple vendors then all you see through the order process is the shipping total. Only when you receive your order confirmation email will you see which vendors charged what for shipping."
3,Finally gave them up,"These glasses work fine for reading during the day (which, I understand, is their primary purpose), but they are a problem for me when trying to read in bed (I can't lean back against the pillow or headboard because the hard ""halo"" pushes the glasses forward) and when trying to hug the grandchildren (the frames are inflexible, and I have gotten complaints from several of the little ones that they hurt) so, I've all but given up on them. Of course, I could have more than one pair of glasses for different times & places but, frankly, it's not worth the trouble to me."
5,A great book of gift baskets!,This is a great book of ideas! The pictures are great and really helped me think of ways to do my own baskets. There is a wonderful section about starting your own business that I found helpful as well. The pictures were great and very creative and professional looking. This book was just what I needed!
3,Very dense (typical Landau),"We used this book for the first semester of graduate e+m. I found it, like all of Landau's books, very dense. It doesn't have enough examples and doesn't expound on many topics (especially magnetostatics). The only thing I liked about the book was that it built up e+m from special relativity. However, I almost immediately bought Jackson, which is a much better book to learn from."
1,Did not work - period.,"Because of the price,I purchased two of these; the order showed that they were supposed to be NEW - however, when they arrived, one of the packages was ""taped-up"" with clear tape.When I installed the first one, power went to the unit however there was no suction from the washer resevoir tank - Synopsis: It didn't work.When I installed the second one, same thing: Did not work.Both items returned; and, still waiting for AMAZON to refund."
5,All New Bible Songs,"This is a very catchy way to learn Bible memory verses as the verse are put to music, very hip and upbeat."
2,Like the tactile feedback but.....,"I was happy with this purchase for the first couple of months, but then suddenly the keyboard would disconnect after a few minutes of inactivity and had difficulty re-pairing (no pun intended). I don't know if it's because of software updates but all I can say is that I've been through numerous batteries to keep them fresh as new and nothing changes. It's been a big pain. Keyboard disconnects randomly then takes another 3-4 minutes to reconnect. Have been unable to find a fix. Now I'm looking for another keyboard. I don't recommend this product at all."
1,Keys stick constantly,"I loved the fact that this keyboard is bigger than the one that comes with the Mac, but I hate that the dang keys stick constantly. It repeats the s's most of all, but it's all the time, and it slows me down. I write for a living, so I don't need to keep going back making stupid corrections from the keyboard. So I think I will end up going back to the original keyboard and trashing this one. It' pointless."
1,Macally Keyboard Dead at 3 months - power issue,"I enjoyed using this Macally BTKey Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for Mac. However, soon after I hooked it up (and the startup was fast and easy) - the ""low battery"" light started to flash. And whatever batteries I had in there, that light continued to flash. Other than that, all worked great. But as of this week, my Macally keyboard has bit the dust - absolutely no response. I suspect an issue with the battery connection/power supply. Very disappointed to say the least that this product is dead in 90 days."
3,if you really want a wireless keyboard with a numberpad,It's an ok keyboard. Not as good as apple's fit and finish. There is even a key that doesn't do anything.It's very heavy and sturdy. But the keys are not very pleasant to use.The only reason I would think to get one is if you really really want your keyboard to be both wireless and have a numeric pad.I prefer the apple keyboard because it's identical to the macbook or macbook pro keyboards so it feels exactly the same and I make fewer mistakes on it.
1,piece of junk...,"I have this keyboard and the batteries die in a very short period of time...I highly recommend NOT getting this one...it's absolutely a piece of junk. My Logitech for my PC laptop is working on over 9 months of battery use...not a problem...the Macally is usually dead within a month or two, at most...Do not buy this...you will not be happy with the fast burn of batteries..."
2,"Love the concept, hate the keyboard","I'll be brief. This keyboard is probably not for anyone that can type reasonably well. Straight out of the box, I experienced an occasional doubling of keys. Instead of 'click' I'd see 'cclick'. If I slowed down my typing, it seemed to reduce the number of times that this happened. If I forgot to pace myself and started speeding up to normal, the doubling happened much more frequently. With this keyboard, I do indeed spend more time correcting this issue than I spend actually typing. I wish I had seen those reviews before I bought this thing."
1,Worse than Space Junk!,"I ordered a second BTKeyboard after the first didn't work and tested the second on a different MAC(Macally claimed a circuit on the first was defective)and had the same bug one more time. The OS(Mac OS 10.6.8) refuses to fully recognize the keyboard--popping up an annoying request to identify the keybaord boot after boot, even though I've already paired and setup the system. I Followed Macally's fine print to tech support, and they couldn't solve the issue and left me holding the bag saying ""It works for us...."" Same issue on two keybords, two separate computers--I don't think so."
3,Loses connection frequently,"Although I love the feel and function of this keyboard, the bluetooth connection frequently drops (I'm using it with an Imac OS 10.6.5). It's only a momentary loss, but frustrating when you're doing a lot of data entry. I've changed batteries, reinstalled the OS, run permission repairs, but continue to have the same problem. I've emailed the company about a driver but have not received a response. The keyboard was easy to install and paired right away with the computer."
1,mine's junk,"Continuously loses the signal to the mac no matter how close it sits; ""Pairing"" light constantly going on. Batteries wear out in a week."
2,"OK, but DO NOT RECOMMEND","I do not recommend; my Macally BTKEY is dead after 3 months of very light use -- could not connect on May 17 (ordered from Amazon on Feb 5, 2011) to a MBPro 15"" and a MBAir.Swapped new batteries out twice to no avail. It was OK for the price, and the gap between typing and actual appearance onscreen was a bit annoying, but tolerable.Since this died beyond the Amazon warranty period, Macally says they will replace it (909.230.6888 - fingers crossed) but I will be searching for a more reliable Bluetooth keyboard with 10-key numeric keypad.Willing to take this risk? There are other similar reviews of this product on amazon.I gambled, but lost.Macally BTKey Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for Mac (White)"
2,frequently causes run away repeat characters,"I was initially happy with this, but then it started this eratic behavior where I would type a key, and it would go into auto repeat mode for some arbitrary length of time. Today it reached the limit of my tolerance when it went into repeating the backspace (delete) key, and I watched hours of typing just disappear. I could not find any way to make it stop.Fortunately, I was working on a remote computer over vnc (but I had had this problem working locally as well, so I don't think that this is a result of the remote access) I used the mouse to break the connection to the remote host, turned the blue tooth keyboard off, connected my old USB keyboard which it replaced, reconnected to the remote computer, and was able to recover all the erased text by using 'undo typing' about 50 times.Now, here it sits on my desk, and I'm afraid to use it! Too late to return to Amazaon, so I will have to try to get MacAlly to correct the problem."
4,Perfect companion to the book,"This DVD set is a perfect companion to Everett's book which has extremely detailed descriptions and many pictures. However, if you are one who learns visually or by example, the pictures may not be enough. The DVD steps in at this point and puts all of the drills into full-color motion. Don't expect any new material to be presented here that's not in the book nor any ""bonus"" sections either. Simply put, it's the book transferred into a video format. If you don't have access to an Olympic lifting coach locally, this DVD will give you a good start on the mechanics of the lifts."
2,"Breadth, not depth; Hard to follow","I purchased the book to gain a deeper understanding of the drivers that lead to burn out to help me avoid finding my way into being burned out again.What I found was a book that said the same thing chapter after chapter with no new information to solve the problems. I felt like there was no coverage of identification of burnout (or only passing references) and there weren't any real suggestions, only exercises which served to identify the things which were important to you.I also found that the table of contents didn't match the page numbering and the index had no page numbers at all. Add to this the difficult in finding headings and it made the book a nightmare to navigate.The one redeaming quality is that the book allows someone who's not sure what their goals are a structured way to discover them."
4,Works good,"Came in a plain envelope and works fine. I am using it for my car remote lock. Product seems to be part of a bulk package as it seemed to have been separated from a set, but seems genuine."
2,"This is not ""Discovery""","for those of you looking for another ""Discovery,"" you will be very disapppointed."
2,D'oh!,"Remember all those great songs on Discovery? One More Time? Digital Love? Harder Better Faster Stronger? Something About Us? And remember all those boring, repetitive songs in between? (me neither). Daft Punk decided to do without good songs and focus on boring, repetive ones and we're left with a crap album! Hurray!"
3,to err is human,"like many artists have before, daft punk are with the title of this album telling us they fully understand it's not what we or they were hoping for. human after all sounds more electric, empty and cold then discovery, at times resembling highly filtered faceless detroit techno or missy elliot instrumentals, at times sounding as a corporate ordered carbon copies of previous accomplished works, meant to be used in advertising.at it's best (make love, television rules the nation, emotion, human after all, the prime time of your life) ""human after all"" appears as even more lazied works of alan braxe & fred falke. at it worst (the rest), sounding as the worst moments from homework covered by an obscure german electronic collective.with most tracks sounding as though they could have flourished further, or as though they were wrapped up too quick due to some sort of severe disheartened state, the hope for this album lies in it's substantial remixing potential."
2,"Catchy but too formulaic, gets boring fast","Though many of the tracks like Human After All are very catchy and fun however within a week they get very old. Essentially, nearly every track on the album revolves around singing the same few words run through a vocoder over and over again throughout the entire song. While there are some cool manipulations of sound and nifty techno guitars, the obviously formulaic approach to constructing each track lends the album to a short shelf life. Also, the beginning of ""The Brainwasher"" seems lifted directly out of Black Sabbath's ""Ironman"" humorously. A fun album, but not one that you'll get much replay value out of."
2,Merde,"Daft Punk were on a short list of groups that I would not hessitate to purchase without a preview listen. They are now off that list. There is about enough original material here to construct one of their usual songs. Next time I'm in Paris, I may swing by their studio to get my $13.99 back.This album and the Chemical Brothers' plodding Push the Button were huge let downs from an increasingly stale electronic scene."
3,I like 3 songs,I would rather have just purchased 3 songs from this CD. The others get on my nerves.
4,toolman,"I bought this because of the high ratings. At first it was frustrating because after you pressurized the tank, it wouldn't spray, it just shut down. After several attempts to get it to work, by releasing pressure at the wand, (and losing product), finally figured out that you cannot over-pressurize it. It works fine after you figure that out. I would recommend this to all, with knowing this problem"
5,GREAT HELP!!!,"Great Book!!! Very easy to understand and excellent for use in a classroom setting. Having not a very strong Crystal background, the material was presented in a way that was easy to follow and greatly improved my Crystal skills."
4,OK,I took a chance and ordered this for a trip to Europe. The arms were too short and neckline was small. If you need it for a short period of time (like a ballgame) it's good.
5,for raptor-lovers of all ages,"I've been teaching raptor biology for two decades to all ages of humans, and this is the most thorough, attractively designed, and accurate kids-oriented book on birds of prey I've seen. Kudos to the Laubachs, who obviously did their homework, and produced both an activity guide and a reference book on all the diurnal and nocturnal birds of prey of the US and Canada. If you have a young raptor watcher in your life, Raptor! would be outstanding for ages 7 to 17, however, the photos and excellent natural history would render it enjoyable for all ages."
2,Not As Good,"Ever since replacing my 12 year old Bunn, I've had the feeling my new brewer didn't make coffee that was quite as good.Today I was visiting a friend who, under the same circumstances, expressed the same sentiment. After some deliberation we decided the new machines may not heat the water to as high a temperature as the old ones.I don't like the new pot either.If you have an old Bunn that still works, keep it, or better yet, trade it to me.(going to change my ""3 stars"" rating to a ""two"")"
4,Just as good as my last 2 Bunns,"It seems very little different from my previous 2 Bunns.It would be nice I suppose to be able to save some energy AND be able to get a great pot of coffee this fast any time I want it, but I can't imagine how.It is sort of annoying to have to replace it every 10-12 years though, but that's just me."
4,"Good album, worth getting, esp for ween fans","I really like this album. Some songs I love. I Feel in Love Today is downright great. Gabrielle is pure Thin Lizzy, almost bettering it. Monique has some sweet guitar play and overall funk. Tastes good on the Bun rules too (totally Pod era). There is no bad song on this album, although I usually might skip some (Isreal, etc). Worth getting most definetly, but maybe not better than WP or Quebec."
3,when he return for me,I love the cd but the words are so hard to understand whats being said on some of the songs other wise it been a rich blessing in my life.
2,Doesn't fit!,"I bought this outfit to go with my daughter's Groovy Girls, but it is too small for the dolls. I have found that to be the case with any extra outfits that I have purchased for the dolls ... they are just too tight. You would think that they would know the standard waist measurement for the dolls and cut the clothes to fit, but they are always too tight. My advice is just to skip the extra outfits and trade outfits that come with the dolls themselves."
1,MK-370 Tile Saw,I purchased the MK-370 Tile Saw (1/2 hp model)in October 2004. On the first day of operation the pump gave out. Then the motor switch gave out. In the middle of a tile job. E-mail to customer service to obtain list of authorized warranty repair centers has gone unanswered. Maybe I got a lemon. I could have bought 3 inexpensive tile saws for the price of this one. In defense of the machine I will say that when it cut it cut well.
2,made in china,"I don't understand why MK, an American company risked the company's image of quality products and start manufacturing cheap tile saws made in china. I was quite upset when I open the MK 159943 MK-370 7"" 1-1/4 HP Tile Saw box and saw the made in china sticker. It takes about 30 minutes to assemble the stand and everything else together. The assembly was easy; however, when I powered on the motor, it made a loud cutter noise and the water pump sucks. I will not buy another MK product."
2,It would be old...,"I bought two batteries (same brand and same specifications than the ones I got) but unfortunately one of them is not working, I think is running out of charge. The package does not have any date.The response time was a little longer I had to wait around 10 days to get the product."
1,Don't Waste Your Time...,"My remote for my Bose Wave Radio finally stopped working reliably. I decided it was probably the battery so I searched Amazon and found a suitable replacement. The price was right (less than $1.50). So I orderd it. When it arrived, I installed it and the remote was still inoperable. I suspected the new battery. I went to a retail store and purchased an identical brand and type battery. The remote works fine now. I expect that the battery shipped to me was not a fresh battery. Just go get one at the store instead of dealing with this."
5,perfect,"this battery makes my watch go. i bought it for Hawaii, and it worked perfectly, as you'd expect a battery to do. luckily all was good or else i would have been annoyed in paradise!"
1,The Sh*T Suck,Jimmy is a good person but his music is trash as a solo artist.He need to stay a CEO and sometimes rap and What Koch records was doing.They need a pep talk to unsign this nigga.I'm not hatin on him but Jimmy need to change his flow and take it easy.He rush into his songs.His two singles out now are hot but how long can it last before he fall.His first Ablum was hard but this one is Screwed & Chopped the (Fu*k up).Don't buy this album buy the first one or More Than music Volume 1 it's hot
1,STICK TO YOUR DAY JOB JIMMY!,"EVEN THOUGH HE IS THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE DIPSET CREWAND DIRECTS VIDEOES AS WELL BEHIND THE CAMERA,WHY DOES HEWANT TO RAP ANYWAY?,YOUR PAID, JIM NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO ITBUT I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS THOUGH IM NOT GOING TO KNOCK THATWHATS SO EVER,IT TAKES A LOT OF GUTS TO PUT YOURSELF OUT THERELIKE THAT,ANYWAY I LIKED THE ""MIAMI JOINT"" WITH TREY, DAM I HOPEHIS NEXT ALBUM IS WAY BETTER,BECAUSE HIS PIPES ARE THROUGHTHE ROOF TO WASTE ON WACK SONGS,THERE'S A FEW IPOD WORTHY TRACKSBUT THE KEY WORD IS ""FEW "" ENOUGH SAID (OUT)"
3,"Byrdgang, byrdgang, byrdgang, byrdgang, byrdgang","Jim Jones' cd Diary of a Harlem Summer has some great tracks, and has some weak ones. Jones starts off the tight songs with G's up which has a great, oldies type sound to it. In track 6 Honey Dip, he raps about DIPSET, and honey blunts. Perhaps the most talented song on the CD is track 10 What you been Drankin on? In this, P Diddy opens up the song and Paul Wall closes it, with a little Jim Jones in the middle.Now, this album wouldn't be that bad at all but there is somebody missing on it. Killa Cam???? With tracks featuring the Diplomats Juelz Santana, it is an absolute tease to listeners to not feature Cam'ron. Other than that, this CD was a pretty solid rap CD if you're into that, but if you are real into Dipset, I'd stick to Juelz Santana's new CD or Killa Cam's old S.D.E., sports, drugs and entertainment. To the arraignment."
4,Jim Is Good,Jim Jones Is Not Wack Hes Not Great Hes Good His flow is 3.5 out of 5 This Cd Is Not A Classic But Not Bad I Say Get itMy Top 3 Songs On Cd1. Honey Dip[best song on there2.what you Been Drinking On3.G's Up
2,A Disapointing Album,"I have always been a fan of the Diplomats, and really liked Jim Jones due to his singles and such. I never got around to listeing to his first CD, so I can't compare these two, but this is just a massacre. Only 5 good songs on the whole CD. Good thing for him is that 4 so far have been singles.""Baby Girl"" ft. Max B""G's Up"" ft. Max B""Summer Wit Miami"" ft. Trey Songz""What You Drinkin' On"" ft. Jha Jha, Diddy & Paul Wall""Tupac Joint"" ft. Hussein Fatal & 40. CalI expected so much more than this because it's a Diplomat joint, which have all been hot. The first three singles I heard were really hot, but they did take some time to get used too. Maybe it's the same with the CD, but I have listened to it various times. I can only hope Juelz' new album is so weak."
5,Lovely,"Dottie Peoples is a very spiritual young woman whose voice and choice of lyrics will make you want to drop everything and praise the lord for what he is to you. She was my mother's favorite singer and before my mother's death, she got ""Her House in Order."" Mother left a tape at home for me to hear and it was ""Testify"" by Ms. Peoples. And yes, I should testify. Go Girl!"
4,Great But should Hold More,"This is a great product, but I wish that It would hold more discs. I know that there is a holder that keeps twice as many discs organized, but it is twice the price."
3,not very pleased,"This seemed to me to be a low budget movie. It had the potential to be a better movie than it was, but it was to me a very low budget movie."
2,Not so good,"Performance is not so good if you compare it with the original price but at the price amazon.com is giving, its worth buying. Compatable in size is the biggest advantage."
2,A book for those who love code errors,Most of the negative reviewers are right about this book. Don't see how you can rate this book very high unless you really don't need to read it in the first place. There are a lot of code errors. The author seems to be making assumptions that you already know enough to make getting through this disaster a breeze.
5,Java Server Pages from scratch,"I found the book to cover JSPs in quite a bit of depth. Addressed was the question of when or why to use JSPs instead of servlets. I found the examples quite informative. There are several design approaches, including their examples, that I found to be relevant to project I am working on. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand JSPs."
4,Direct and to-the-point,"As a web developer and site architect, I didn't need another course in CGI and general programming. So when I had to evaluate JSP for a new project I wanted to hit the ground running. The author's approach of taking a common web application and going through the whole design and implementation cycle ""from scratch"" provided me with just the right balance of practical working examples and insightful tips to help me make a decison. Not surprisingly I am in the process of rewriting a major piece of my site from Perl to JSP. The book is targeted towards in-the-field site designers. Wish it had fewer typos. A great book nevertheless."
3,Money makes the world go round,I was disappointed.I thought that we will die of hunger and here we are worried about the nuclear family not getting their price for the hives.I was extremely irritated by the mother. Not supporting the son who is stressed and not giving her opinion openly.
5,Good 4 port mini hub,Easy to use. Doesn't take up much room. Good for both desk tops and lap tops. Small enough to carry in your pocket but big enough to not get lost on your desk top.
1,No Stars For This One,"This Review is for the 4 port PA055U Targus USB Hub. Another lump of plastic for my junk box. Save your money and buy the connectland for half the price of this one. Mine was dead on arrival. I thought it was maybe the power supply ""seeing as it has a 5 volt external power port"". I went thru many places looking and finally used an old cell phone charger that had the same matchup config. Still didn't work for me. No blue lights no recognition at all when I plugged it in. Basically useless. If I hadn't taken it apart to look inside for power problems I would return it. But it looks pretty in my box with my other useless dead computer peripherals."
3,Not what I expected,It does not support External Hard drives and basically I nedded it to plug 3 or 4 hard drives at the same time so... 3 stars is fair enough
4,Adequate Hub,I found the hub to be functional and I like that fact that the outlet that you use lights. I use it without the supplemental power.
2,The information could have been in one CD (instead of 3),"I like to listen to self improvement CDs while at the gym, so I picked this one up. While there is some good information in here, CD #1 was a complete time waster and CDs #2 & #3 could have been condensed into one effective CD. It also doesn't help that the narrator sounds like a gerbil on helium. It's the most annoying narration voice I've heard in quite awhile, and it makes it hard to take the content seriously. There are some great self improvement CDs out there - this isn't one of them."
4,Magick for All,"This series is an awesome read for the female teens. It pulls one in and makes them want to read the whole series as fast as they can. It has drama, adventure, magick, and the always wanted love."
4,One of the best in the series,"This was probably one of my favourite books in the whole series. Now Cal is temporarily out of the picture, you start to love Hunter as you see what he's really like. I was very impressed with the clever way in which Cate completely swaps four of the main characters around, turning Cal and Selene from good characters to evil ones and Hunter and Sky from seemingly evil to good. I just wish Sky would trust Morgan more. My only complaint is that David resorts to dark magick quite unnecesarily, I felt. Why didn't he just do a gain money spell instead of calling a Taibhs? That way he wouldn't need to have had his powers stripped. I liked the ending with the Morganite though. I thought that was really sweet."
5,learn the history of break dancing and b-boy culture,"An excellent introduction and education of break dancing as a culture and art. Any one who listens to modern day urban music (hip-hop or rap, etc) should check out this DVD to understand the significance of break dancing and the beginning of it all, not only break dancing but hip-hop as well."
5,Great Music,"Bennett really know how to sign, great songs through the entire CD. Of course I'm from the Bay Area so we all like the music covering SF."
5,If you had only one ricky nelson cd...this is it.,"fantastic collection of ricks early rock'n'roll tracks. a ton of songs in a very nice package, get it."
4,Entertaining but a little flat,"I found the book to be an excellent look at the lives of Joe Louis and Max Schmeling, perhaps slanted towards Max more than Joe in terms of coverage and of interest.The fight itself is not looked at in great depth at all mainly because it was so short.A difficult book to write as the reality is that the Match of the Century between both men was pretty much a slaughter.If I had to nit-pick, I would say that the author didn't grab me with the writing, which is not necessarily a bad thing, just making an observation."
4,Top Mexican Comics,"Very good family movies, these Spanish (Mexican) artists keep thier humor very clean, which all family member can watch."
2,Battery with very short life,"This battery works for only about a quarter of the time that you get from a real Canon battery. Maybe I just got a bad battery, but I'm now looking for a replacement for this short timer."
4,Diary of a Hoboe,"The story line is thin and rather forgettable. The character of Paul is ambiguous. Now he drifts without purpose or goal, then - all of a sudden - he shows character in standing up to the mob or trying to solve the mystery of the drowned woman. He can be responsible, as in his newspaper job, and then he drifts off again to take care of his misplaced libido. The writing styly is above average, though, and the redeeming grace are the very humorous asides."
4,Great Story for Creative Spiritual Refelction,"I read the Disappearance of the Universe by Gary Renard and found it to be a little hard to believe as non-fiction, but was entertaining and a creative story to get us to reflect on our own spiritual relationship with the Universe. Lik The Shack, it's a little ""out there"", but if it helps people to reflect on their own spirituality and softens them to being a better, more forgiving, and loving person, than it's a great piece of work.. I did not have the time to read the whole book at once, and could not wait to get back to it and pick up from where I left off..I also, had a hard time putting it down and found myself tardy for an occassion by pushing the clock too far...If you like reading stories related to spiritual mysteries, different philosphies, and want something that may help you discover something new about yourself, this would be a good read... As far as it being true...not so sure I'm completely on board with that..."
3,A Course in Miracles,"The book integrates with 'A Course in Miracles'. It does not deal with Sex, Past lives, and illusions like other books do. So if you are not a course in Miracles student, you will be very disappointed."
1,No Intelligent Life,"I can't believe that any 'serious' student of ACIM would like this book. Or anyone with a brain. It's not worth the time to do any kind of in-depth analysis so suffice it to say this is trash for the gullible, pure and simple. Laced with sophomoric 'humor' and riddled with nonsense, this book has no place in the ranks of any book that deals with such profound subject matter. I found it offensive. As fiction lite, I give it a 'C-'. In any other literary capacity, a resounding 'F'."
2,unconvincing at best,"The most bizzare thing, to me, was the fact that Gary is supposed to be some uneducated ""shmuck"", who's very ""surprized"" by the fact that he was ""chosen"" by the ascending masters. Strangely, during the encounters, he sometimes appears to posses knoweledge of different religions, sects, saints, etc. that is far beyond what an average, even educated, person might have. And then the language that the ascending masters sometimes use? It sounds more like Gary speaking. I tend to think that Gary made up the whole thing: the ascending masters, the ideas....Having said that, some of the information in the book is very interesting, albeit not that revolutionary, the only truly new concept being ""forgiveness"", which I find highly disturbing. Also, the fact that we're supposed to obey The Holy Spirit and let him guide us back home, as if we're some poor lost helpless children, waisting our time playing some imaginary games (reality)."
5,Mind-Blowing!,"Once I started reading the 1st page I couldn't put it down! It is extremely easy to read and understand; but what surprised me was the humor! I found myself laughing out loud many times along the way. It was a reminder to me that life should not be so serious!.... leave room for laughter every day.If you are familiar with the principles of A Course in Miracles, and even if you're not, this book will help you along your path to ""enlightenment"" (a big word that is explained very easily and simply in the book). I highly recommend this book to anyone who is at a cross-roads and is looking for answers on their journey through this lifetime."
5,A Great Spiritual Book,"This is a book that answers more questions than any other spiritual book I've ever seen. It's awesome. This has become my favorite book. Many of the people I know who are reading it are reading it several times. It covers many subjects and does so in a very fascinating way. The teachers in the book are two ascended masters who the author says appeared to him in the flesh from out of nowhere. In a previous incarnation they were St. Thomas and St. Thaddaeus. By the end of the book they have put it all together in a great way, and I had to believe they were who they said they were. Highly recommended."
5,The Best Spiritual Book Out There,"The Disappearance of the Universe is a book that is about REAL spirituality, rather than simply ""manifesting your desires"" which is a method that distracts you from what real spirituality is all about. I learned more about what great masters like Jesus and Buddha were really talking about from this book than any other book I've ever read in my life. It's also entertaining, funny, crystal clear, and timeless. I thank the author for not following the crowd."
2,Disappointing....,"I really wanted to like this book. It sounded so interesting, but it was actually quite a disappointment. There are a few points in the book that I liked, but there is a lot that is questionable and just doesn't ring true. I was so turned off by the trash-mouth language and tone of the conversation that I found it hard to take any of it seriously. I just can't believe that two ""ascended masters"" would talk like that. The author states in the introduction that they said they needed to talk like that in order to get his attention. I'm sorry, but an ascended master wouldn't need to resort to trash-talk in order to get a human's attention. I can't say if this conversation actually took place, but if it did, I don't believe these were ""ascended masters"" that he talked with."
1,Rewriting the Scriptures,"Excuse me, but who gave this man permission to rewrite the Bible? These ""ascended masters"" who are supposedly reincarnations of saints take all kinds of quotes and ideas from the Bible and then say...Well it really means this, or This is what really happened, I was there. They basically ""reword the Word"" to their liking. If you're going to come up with a truly original spirituality, why use the Bible at all? Leave it alone, use your own ideas. What a rip-off! You can't just go around and steal other people's values, twist them around, and dish them out. There's nothing in this book but a shredded up Bible."
5,thankyou,"I can only say thank you to the Spirit that brought the book into being and to me. I asked that the books that I would need, be brought to me and that has been happening since I asked and this was one of the books. Many different books speak to many different people. This one was written for me!"
5,The Disappearance of The Universe,"Based on the general insights of two research psychologists that wrote A Course In Miracles about 1976, this book (DU) has made a fun read out of some difficult concepts and is akin to ""taking the cod liver oil with the orange juice"". A a 'metaphysical junkie' for over 35 years, I can't sing enough praises about this book. It is definitely not for the highly opinionated reader but is highly beneficial for the 'true searcher' who wants to explore all options about the meaning of life and wants to ""think out of the box"". I am on my 3rd reading."
2,Would you deny your maker?,"If you disagree with me, then I forgive you because you have not advanced to my level of thinking yet, this is the gist of this book. I agree that this reality is vibrating strings of matter put forth but not disappearing, we are all here for a reason and to deny it is folly.I cannot recommend this book for I see a different though parrellel way to enlightenment, one that needs no hierarchy and needs no intermediaries between myself and God."
3,Didn't speak to my soul,"Well, some of it did. But the sarcasm was at times annoying, and some of it didnt make a whole lot of sense to me. Along these lines, I much prefer Byron Katie's works, and method of inquiry as path to peace. I think the Course in Miracles demonizes the Ego unnecessarily, while BK's way of observing does not. Plus I've never cottoned to religions, and The Course (and this book about The Course) has way too churchy and flowery verbage for my liking. I want to say, ""Hey Jesus, enough with the Shakespear, just talk straight.""So, this book was interesting. Not great. If you're looking for a way to peace and love, I think Byron Katie's teachings are easier to apply, and not as preachy."
2,from from to to,"I read this this one and ""your immortal reality"" and I enjoyed his talk on the course, but when he gets into his own ideas about politics, evolution, and future telling, it gets a bit silly. He talks goes on and on about reincarnation and past lives, yet course in miracles claims there is no such thing. And his am's keep giving predictions of the future. If you're gonna start predicting the future, do it within a few weeks, not a few years, decades, or centuries. He writes on the defensive most of the time. I don't know. I am thankful that I came across this book because it eased me into a course in miracles and let me know how difficult it would be. But other than that, this book reads like the national inquirer. I've had mystical experiences and they come in all shapes an forms. Seems that Renards mystical experiences are always text book and cliche."
5,The Best Book Ever Written About A Course in Miracles,"There have been a few people who have written reviews here and said that this is the best book ever written about A Course in Miracles, so having studied the Course for ten years and read several other of the popular books about it, I figured I'd give this one a try. I want to add my opinion that yes, this is the best. It BLOWS AWAY the others. If you read this entire book you'll understand A Course in Miracles and be able to read it and have it make sense to you, even if you've never studied the Course before. I've heard people in study groups say the same thing, but now I know from first hand experience. The Disappearance of the Universe should be required reading for anyone who is interested not just in the Course, but in spirituality in general."
5,Excellent Book Answers many many questions,"This book is one of the best books I have found to answer questions like, Who am I? Why am I here? What is life? Who is God? Who was Jesus?"
5,Hilarious!,"Racy, but that's part of what makes it so dang funny. Definitely not for kids or those who are prudish!"
4,"blood, sex, zombies, monsters",This edition by Rob Zombie is an extension of his brilliant ability to showcase his demented mind. The characters in this movie are based on his paperback of the same title. It is good for Zombie fans.
4,El Superbeasto,"Not your kid vid. Really good animation. The comic by Rob Zombie is even more graphic. If it is sacred to someone, they make fun of it."
3,Maintenance managers should have employees read this book too...,Maintenance managers should have employees read this book too..The Pocket Maintenance Adviser: A Maintenance and Operation Crew best practices reference book
3,Love it - would be better if I could see all of it.,"Great book for trying to develop metrics for maintenance and evaluating CMMS. The best part of the book has been the appendicies. Unfortunately the Kindle version makes them extremely hard to read (in at least one case, impossible) due to not being able to zoom in. If you could read all of the tables easily I would be giving it 5 stars. I would recommend the hard copy version until they can address the zoom/table resolution issue. 5 star book, didn't quite get the Kindle version right."
4,Unbreakable,GOOD movie- good vs evil......lets you take a look at things in a differnt way- great acting- love it!! so glad it was on DVD now
1,Lies and Deception,"What an interesting author!?! If you research him, he has also been catholic and who knows what else he proclaims to be. Is he just the incarnate of the master of lies? Research Bill and his other books before you buy."
1,My true rating is half-star at best,"Buyer beware, especially Seinfeld fans. Heed the other reviews. Seinfeld has a 2-minute clip. To be honest, I haven't even really watched most of the other chapters. As soon as I realized that Seinfeld was a mere two minutes of this rip-off, I signed right on and wrote this. Thanks a whole bunch, Improv and Koch Vision."
4,Good sturdy Bike,its an amazing bike and I am pretty happy with the purchase... would have given it 5 stars except that it requires allen keys and a spanner for assembly which took me over a week to get as I dont have a car ... so if you are planning to just get a bike and start riding .. try the nearest target store .. or if you want quality .. get this one .. little expensive but trusty bike frm mongoose ..-letitsnow
2,what the !f,"bike is terrible but looks cool amd came at a good price ?? the seat is way too uncomfortable !!!!! rear brakes have come undone 3 times so far ??!!!! bike gets loose at major points must tighten on a weekly basis handlebars seat post etc,,, would not but again in the future ??? should get a refund or some kind of credit !!!!!!!!!!!!11"
3,Good bike for under 100 bucks,Overall a good value. Assembly not too difficult. Clunky gear shifting. Brakes were difficult to adjust. Almost as heavy as a steel bike. Nice ride with the shocks.
2,Unhappy :-(,Unhappy that there were many scratches on the frame upon arrival and on such a large purches it's hard to return. Also very unhappy with the grip shifters not working properly and needing to be adjusted before being used.
2,THE BIKE IS good BUT...,THe bike is good but.. it doesnt come with the tools that u need to assemble it.. I didnt know that everything u buy online needs to be assembled... i got the bike on discount during the COOL DEALS.. and it costs almost the same if u assemble it at a bike shop.. quite inconvenient when you don't have time...
2,"Good product, poor shipping and packaging","For the price, I thought this was a really good deal. Dual suspension and aluminum frame. Unfortunately, the other reviews regarding the condition of the bike through shipment are absolutely true. Upon receipt of the first bike, the shifter was bent, so I had to return it. Upon receipt of the second bike through a return, the rear wheel was warped and the clamp for the seat was missing. I would think that there is a better way to ship this bike to avoid these issues."
4,Steve,"That's the wrong song... :(Anyway thanks for the reply ;)I was looking for the song played during the beginning ""audition"" for drivers of VeroneVery fast rap song..."
4,wicked soundtrack...,the movie was the pits....but if you're into 'cheese' than its right up your alley...but the soundtrack was wicked!...dam good if youre looking for something to bounce to while drivin or gettin ready to hit tha clubs...like the others said Ludacris is right up there with Trick Daddys Represent.
5,Very Good Soundtrack,"I bought this CD because Reggie Young, the trombonist for Earth, Wind and Fire, plays on the soundtrack. The CD also features some great music by Bootsy Collins, Parliament and others. It's a fun, funky soundtrack. I like it alot and have listened to it many times."
3,Never used it,"I bought this book, and promptly forgot about it. I guess that I really just didn't find it that helpful for my studies. That said, it might be more useful if you buy it at the very beginning of your latin class, rather than in your second year."
5,OH DEAR GODDESS,"I can not explain how awesome this book is. Congrates on such an extremely well written book to Cate Tiernan. Whens the 7th come out? Ican't wait. If you haven't read this series its great, and if your wondering this book answers a ton of questions, like how Maeve and Angus died."
1,He got it wrong,"As a volunteer with Mr. Packer in Togo, I was thrilled when the book came out , bought it, and was quickly discouraged to read such a cheap shot at the Peace Corps and Togo. Clearly he is an excellent writer. Unfortunately he used his talent to paint an inaccurate picture of the Peace Corps in Togo and the Togolese people. Perhaps it is because he did very little during his limited service in the Peace Corps in Togo, and in fact left before the end of his service; indeed, it is often in the second year that volunteers have their ""aha"" moments as reality falls into place and it becomes easier to make sense of a culture so different from your own."
5,Oh My God. Turns Out I'm a Total Doofus...,"I eat out frequently, on a lot of business dinners. I read about this book in a magazine and ordered it. A fun, fast read with easy-to-digest information about tipping, wine, becoming a ""regular"" at a restaurant (how to score perks), and... table manners.This is where my doofus-ness comes in. My napkin is supposed to be folded to the left of my plate (not on my chair) if I get up to pee? Utensils can never touch the table (not even the handles) once you pick them up?? I was wincing over and over as I learned all the little habits I had wrong.On the upside, I've got it pretty much straight now. In fact, fun fact: I went to dinner after reading just the intro/first chapter, and scored a FREE glass of fancy wine... Already recouped the cost of the book!"
1,Pass on this Vase,"Readable only as an intended, and very heavy-handed, parody of the cozy genre. Oh - don't expect any interesting tidbits about antique vases, quilting or tea blends more exotic than Earl Grey as currently found in other cozies. Rated 1 Star because this review program requires a rating."
1,Don't buy this toaster,"Update - after about a month, the toaster stopped popping up. After reviewing the warranty, I have send back the toaster at my cost (will only communicate via letter correspondence), and also include money for them to send it back - FOR A $20 TOASTER. DON'T BUY THIS TOASTER"
2,Disappointed,"This product was advertised by Amazon.com as beig in a wooden box. Unfortunately, it came in a cardboard box. The person for whom this was purchased as a gift did not know and said he was happy. Nevertheless, had I known that it would be packed in cardboard I would have continued too look for one in a wood box, like the one I have. I am quite disappointed."
5,Great buy,"This toy arrived extremely fast and in great condition. Also, it was very reasonable considering its a muppet collectible. I give it an A+"
5,Excellent Product,"The pasters have good adhesion, and perfect paper thickness. What I really like is the heavy cardboard box that they come in - - it's really a dispenser that dispenses the pasters from the roll inside, like postage stamps. I'll definitely buy these again. I considered black masking tape, and actually bought some, but the nice dispenser box makes these so much more convenient to use."
3,Nice Case,"This is a great case but the only thing, the head set that comes with the stiletto does not fit in the case."
2,Beware of limitations,"This book is great to have but beware of inaccurate descriptions, everything from approaches, to route length, to bolt locations etc... After doing 30 or so of the routes in this book, I recommend scouting out the approach and everything else about a route sometime before doing the route. The publisher should put out a second edition after they bribe climbers to send in corrections for 5 years."
2,Manufacturing error,This coffee maker was manufactured with a plunger under the top that keeps the water from exiting the chamber. I was able to fix by prying the top off the coffee maker and dismantling the plunger. It should have never left the factory like that.
2,Disappointed,"We have been using a Bunn coffeepot for years. This one is a big disapointment. The carafe spout is too small so when you pour the water in, it spills all over. Also the carafe area is flat so the pot slides around. I would love to return it."
2,Tried it but it's being returned,"I was so hopeful, given the ""Bunn"" name but when I set out to try my first pot, the reservoir leaked all over my counter. I followed the instructions to a T so when I filled it for the first time, I thought maybe I had dribbled the water myself, while pouring it in......................not so. After wiping up the counter, I waited the required 15 minutes for the water to heat up and then poured my first pot to begin the brewing process. Well, it leaked all over the counter as well so I knew it wasn't me. I will probably continue to purchase the basic Mr. Coffee pots that have served me so well."
2,Makes good coffee but.....,Makes good coffee but we've had two in two years. They both cracked in the water tank housing above the filter basket and then leaked water all over. Also with finer coffee grinds it will overflow and gets grounds inside somewhere that continually redeposit themselves on your counter top for weeks after.
2,Bunn Velocity Brew,"I am sorry to say that I am not happy with my purchase. The details made this find very exciting. Bottom line it makes a cup of coffee. I cannot say that it is a great cup of coffee or even a good cup of coffee. I think the problem is that the coffee is not brewed hot enough. The coffee is cold in your mug within two minutes of pouring. There is also a misconception with this pot. Bunn details that you will have coffee within 3 minutes, which you do. But I should have wondered how it is done. Your coffee maker has to always be on to keep the water warm in the unit. It makes a quick pot of coffee, but I would rather it take ten minutes and have a hotter brew than cold coffee. Bunn is a good brand, but this coffee maker is not for me. I would have prefered their other model that takes longer."
2,not quite functional,"We read quite a few wonderful reviews on this coffee pot, so when our Cuisinart died [only after 2 years @ $100.00, we thought we'd take a chance on this one. As some others stated...it leaked all over the counter. Amazon was wonderful with the return process, you cannot beat their service !"
3,Bunn Coffee Maker,"We've used a Bunn Coffee Maker for at least 20 years and loved it. The new Bunn we've received has a four inch crack underneath the water reservoir (the ground coffee filter holder is below the reservoir). We didn't see the crack until recently (obviously we don't look under the reservoir very often).Ground commercial coffee, over the last several years, have gotten finer and finer. Our favorite coffee has been Yuban and it not only has gotten finer, Yuban no longer makes decaf for large cans. It's not the Bunns problem that periodically the coffee overflows due to the coagulation of the ""fine"" coffee slowing the dripping therefore raising the water in the filter. This especially happens with our next best coffee, Folgers decaf. The Bunn overflows due to the fine coffee. It doesn't overflow when we add regular Yuban ground coffee to the Folgers ground decaf."
1,The worst movie ive ever watched.,"A baby that drinks blood. boo-hoo! The camera takes are sometimes very close (and very long) on meaningless activities like eating tofu... or the tv not working... or a piece of meat... or the cat... it happens all the time and its very annoying. The mother is clueless and a freak, so is her mother in law. The characters are so unpleasant and lacking personalities, I'd say they would deserve that baby. The story is just lame. Nothing really happens in the end, its totally predictable."
4,Odd and Hypnotic,"I actually quite liked this one. I am a real horrror fan and found this break from the slasher mode to be enjoyable. It's hard to describe: a bit Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, It's Alive, maybe some Dracula ... really good though. A slow pace here, so it's definitely not a thrill or jump per minute. Nice direction and lighting. Good performances. Jordan Ladd looks a lot like her mother (Cheryl) only older (thanks to mom's extensive plastic surgery). She's also a better actress. A nice change of pace for horror fans. Recommended."
3,Creepy all the way,"Grace is a creepy horror movie. It you like the bloody gore type of horror movies then I think you may like this one. However, this movie isn't a slasher type of bloody. The blood and gore in this movie has meaning but still disgusting all the same. It kind of starts out slow but don't worry because it picks up.This movie is different than most movies you see today which is good. It's definetely more on the disturbing creative side so it's definetely worth seeing at least once. I gave it 3 stars because its just a little over the top for me but worth checking out anyways."
1,"not even worth 1 star, not even a horror movie","the beginning of the movie was promising, with an 8-month pregnant lady getting into a car accident that jolted my senses upward in anticipation as it reminded me of the premise to an amazing preggo-lady horror movie, 'inside'. aside from a car accident that didn't do much for the plot, and another pregnant widow, this movie was nothing like 'inside'. in fact, i even gave it 1 star because it was so awful! this movie was so damn boring and drawn out about a stupid baby that a mother and grandmother were fighting so catty over, i was trying to keep my eyes open wondering when the excitement was going to happen...jerry springer has better baby mama drama! needless to say, the excitement never came, and the movie never delivered.you want to see a great horror movie about pregnant women? watch 'inside'.inside > grace"
3,Interesting movie,"I like Jordan Ladd, she reminds me of her mother a lot. After years of trying to conceive, Madeline and Michael Matheson are finally pregnant. But with only weeks before delivery, an accident leaves both Michael and the unborn child dead. Devastated, Madeline determines to carry the child to term and deliver naturally. What seemed like madness becomes a miracle when, after delivering a stillborn child, Madeline finds her baby is indeed alive... and hungry. She soon discovers that her baby - now named Grace - thirsts for something more than mother's milk, and Madeline is determined to feed her, no matter the consequences. With nowhere to turn, Madeline must make a mother's ultimate decision: What will she sacrifice to keep her child alive? Intersting movie,"
3,Not Bad but Think and Grow Fluent is Better,"This book is filled with fast and useful tricks to jump start anyone's language learning.However, two ebooksThink and Grow Fluent (Secrets of Language Success)andAutomatic Fluency - Nine Steps to Speaking Languages and Finishing Fluent (Secrets of Language Success Series)are even more effective at creating thelearning mindset which is critical to learning a new language.What happens externally is important, but if your subconscious language thermostat is set to 'zero fluency', then noneof the techiques in the world will work. This is where 'Think and Grow Fluent' really outpaces other 'how to' books on learning languages.It goes far deeper.If you had to choose between 'Quick and Dirty'and 'Think and Grow Fluent' I would take 'Think and Grow Fluent'.If I had the money for both, I would read 'TGF' first, and follow up with 'Quick and Dirty'."
2,A Good Documentary That Shoud Be Rented And Not Bought,"This is a good documentary about John Lee Hooker. However, it's best to rent this dvd, due to the mediocre concert performance by Hooker. This is understandable, though, considering Hooker's advanced age. There are simply too many musicians on the stage with him, and he barely touches his guitar. The setlist is unimpressive. The documentary portion of this dvd is very interesting, mostly due to Eric Clapton's comments, which are insightful and informative. The bonus material with Clapton being interviewed about his love for the Blues and his first time hearing Hooker is a real treat, as well. Eddie Kirkland, Johnnie Johnson, and John Hammond should have had some more screen time on this dvd."
1,cracks and warps,"After just two days of use the board was noticeably warped and had a 2 1/2"" crack near one of the hand slots.I returned it and got a long grain board.I attended a knife care seminar with Master Knifesmith Bob Kramer and he recommended hardwood boards, either end-grain or long grain. He thought that bamboo and composite wood boards may be too hard. He likes maple and hinoki.Also, this is not a defect, but if you're not expecting it, the 14 1/2"" x 19"" model weighs around 14 lbs."
2,Recording is ok...,"The Dwell among us recording is ok. A little too much dialogue at times, but you can live with it. Cage attempts to make a go with super hyped up praise & worship, but probably needs to do some good old fashioned tarrying for his music to be truly effective and anointed."
1,Dumbest Gangster Movie,"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be good but what I got was a horrible acting and dumb plot out of this movie. Most of the character dont even speak, its just a Voice Over dictating the whole movie and the main character keeps on saying the work Bird over and over. I almost feel asleep and wanted to turn this movie off right after the first 10 mins. Take my advice and dont watch this movie its pointless."
2,this movie suked!!!!!!,i thought this movie was gonna lik goodfellas or something better. But hell no this movie was boribg the only it was bout is bout hatin that's it.
2,Don't buy now (in 2012),"This is a Groovy Girl from several years ago. I didn't think that was a big deal and got two, knowing my girls wouldn't even know the dolls weren't current. The main problem with the dolls is that their shoes are covered with a sparkly, vinyl like coating. The vinyl coating on both dolls shoes arrived cracked and falling apart. I don't think it's the sellers fault, it seems to just be the case that the materials have been sitting for several years and have broken down. The sparkly vinyl can be completely peeled off (there is fabric underneath) and the doll is very functional and cute. I would not buy this particular doll again because the shoe material coming off was very messy and not exactly something you want your kids to touch."
2,Inadequate information about this product,"I just bought this item from Amazon assuming that it would be usable for both computer CDROM drives and audio CD players. Wrong! This product, according to the packaging, is ONLY for computer CD drives. It would have changed my mind about buying it had I known this."
5,"Beneath the Armor, Great Book",Beneath the Armor is a collection of life's lessons for business people just like us. Decision making for business owners and business managers can be a very lonely process. Reading Ole Carlson's book is like having a good friend or mentoring board member along with you to assist in your business. The book includes real life examples of how small business managers met their difficult challenges which will inspire you to do the same with your business.
1,Off the Chain,"Christa Lederer, ex-Amazon customer. I have not seen this particular product, but I do know that Amazon sells books that promote dog fighting, a felony. Since Amazon refuses to pull these books (they refered to them as ""entertainment"" in an e-mail to me where I complained about the sale of said literature.) I have since stopped purchasing anything from Amazon."
1,Outdated,"Although the book provides insightful examples of how OPNET can be used as an effective network simulation tool, the tutorials are written based on an old version of OPNET and the examples bear no resemblance to the tool as it is shipped today.NOT A GOOD WAY TO LEARN OPNET VERSIONS > 3.5"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you are trying to learn OPNET 5.1, then look for another book. Even though the publishing date of this book is listed as December of 1999, it is NOT written for the current version of OPNET (OPNET 5.1, which was released last year).The book does provide an e-mail address for comments regarding the book. However my queries to that address regarding this problem have gone unanswered.Profoundly disappointing."
4,OVER-PRICED HERE,"TRY TOYS-R-US, WAL-MART OR TOYWIZ DOT COM FOR THIS ITEM. THEY USUALLY SEEM TO HAVE BETTER PRICES ON THE LPS ITEMS. 11-20-2006 WHOOPS! I GUESS I MISSPOKE! TOYWIZ IS ASKING AN OUTRAGEOUS PRICE FOR THIS ITEM ALSO! OH WELL! KEEP LOOKING! DO NOT PAY THESE OUTRAGEOUS PRICES!!!!!"
5,"A quick, entertaining read.","Need a weekend of laughter and escape? Get a copy of George : You Rascal, You. Make sure it is a weekend where you have no previous engagements because you won't want to put down this frolicking account of Wichita, Kansas' own Good Fella. George's voice shines through as he tells stories of the ""Good 'Ol Days"" of crime, corruption, and the American Way."
3,My father's book....,"For those interested, the original book, which this is not, has not left my hands in 20 years, it is a wonderful book, and reflects who he really was, and why.I'm having a problem getting Amazon to respond to the price of this book for sale, it is no longer available, but the sequel, is part of an auction in Wichita, Ks with Malone auctioneers, any other questions or comments are appreciated.Alexis Poulos"
2,For Beginners ? Are you kidding ?,"I Got this to add to my workout DVD's I have a few Nonbeginners dance and they are much easyer to do that this. In my opinion It's 90's ish you just jump into it she does explain easy moves but things like the ""rocking horse"" she needs to go into more detail or your just going to hurt your self. Also one of the girls doing it with Pam Cosmi is in jeans and not the workout fake kind they are just jeans they look like Glow jeans from Sears (and all my life Ive been told to never go to dance class or do a work out in restrictive clothing) and she does more than half the moves wrong. I'll keep trying but I don't think I'll ever like it ...."
5,I Love Numb3rs!,"I think this is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. I absolutely look forward to Friday nights and getting to see my heroes in action. It's a different take on crime solving, something creative and exciting. Every character is well played in this, especially David Krumholtz and Rob Morrow. The relationship between Charlie and Don is edgy, but it's really cool to see them work together. Keep up the good work, boys!"
5,Great characters and good stories.,"I really enjoy this show, it's basically clean (not suitable for kids), strong characters including strong smart men which are sadly lacking in many shows these days! :)"
5,Love it !!!,"If you are sick of stupid ""reality"" shows you will love Numb3rs. You don't have to be a math genious to understand how Charlie's mind works. besides, David Krumholtz plays his part beautifuly. This show is different and refreshing. Finally, as a girl I must say I find Charlie really cute."
5,Numb3rs-first season rocks,Great to see the first season again as this production company hasn't overdone showing every episode over and over. If you're a fan - get it. You don't realize how much the characters evolve and this is very evident. Not sure I like where Charlie going this year with his new frumpy/unkempt look but fun to see the original version of his character. Definitely worth having in your library.
2,Cute but Only for low temp stuff,These are very cute and came on time but they are only for low temp stuff. Please DO NOT use for hard candy as the molds will melt and the company will not return your money.
2,Stiletto Armband Review - it's ok.,"It works fine, doesn't slip which is nice. To look at, it's not much and looks a little on the cheap side, but again, it does work. I really debated over this one and the gray-ish one, and I wish I would have gone with the other one had it not been for the very long projected waiting time on its delivery. If you want one right now, and don't care if its cute or not, then this product will work. If you want something cute, go with the other brand."
5,Review of Jacques Lacan's Seminar on The Psychoses,"This is an essential book for understanding Lacan's overall theoretical framework. Despite the esoteric sounding title, it is not just for specialists and doesn't just treat the subject of psychosis. Lacan reviews and repeats here with greater clarity the theories he developed in his first two seminars."
3,A relic,"What I expected for a mildly used cassette Transcriber. Can't find many of them these days, since the new USB pedals and transcription software are becoming more popular.Good little machine."
2,"OK, but only for office applications","The mic works OK. It picked up my speech loud and clear...with a bit of static. As for the actual ""phones"" portion of it, they are only good for listening to LoFi stuff. Don't count on your mp3s, CDs, MDs, etc sounding ANY better than a record. I would suggest using this for speech-to-text, but that's it! Bottom line, get a desktop mic and a pair of Sony headphones if you want music and mic. Oh, and where is the return counter?"
3,Well...,"Well for the price it was good considering it came free with my PC, but after a year the magnet fell out (which wasn't hard to fix) but then the wiring started to break so it died."
4,Great,"I have loved Relient for forever, I'm a musician and have made my own recordings, and I don't hear the high pitched noise on the disc. I downloaded it off the web so I don't know if that has anything to do with it but I've listened to it on headphones through the computer, cd player, mp3 player, through a stereo by itself and I haven't heard the noise mentioned on a few reviews which is why I downloaded it instead of buying it first. Songs are great and I'm glad they released Apathetic Way to Be on cd instead of only the MMHMM vinyl and also I am really liking all the songs that the band is doing on piano. The piano parts in past songs have been great and I am glad they are bring it in more. Go get it!"
1,Hmmmm . . .,"Did anyone else notice that the 8 glowing reviews were all written within a month of each other, and all within a month and a half of when the book was first published? Hmmm."
1,FramePro 750XL - Firing Problems,"When I first received this tool, I took it out of the box and fired a few test nails into some blocks of wood on the floor, and everything seemed OK. But, then I took it out to the job site, and found that it would ONLY nail when pointed down. If I tried to nail into walls or ceiling, nothing happened when I pulled the trigger. I also noticed a small air leak at the top. Needless to say, I will be returning this one. I will exchange it for another of the same model, since I have had NO problems like this before with Senco nailers. Nice features include adjustable depth, option for both bottom fire and restrictive trigger, and plenty of power to drive into tough wood. I personally prefer bottom fire to restrictive trigger, for quicker framing."
3,Book on American classical music - her modern interpretation is a stretch...,"It may just be me, but in reading the entirety of this book, especially regarding the sections on ""nihilistic"" punk and industrial music, I get the strong feeling that Martha Bayles has never listened to the music she is condemning, and is name and band dropping just to be worldly and topical.I also get the feeling (I don't know for sure) from the tone of this book that she herself is not musically inclined or plays any instruments; an attribute that I would assume would be a necessary requisite to comment on such a subjective and passionate subject."
5,Awesome CD,I've heard these guys from the beginning and I've been hooked ever since. This album is put together by two guys who love what they do. Great job on the tracks and all the hard work you put into this.
4,"Pretty, unique, but....",Run a little narrow. Had to send back because they were not comfortable on my daughter's feet. Did like them though.
5,Jay Black,Love the old songs. Brings back memories from the past. Great singer. Listen to it over and over with my husband.
1,Not worth!,"Inormation given in this Article is available freely on net. It does not tell you anything different than understanding your existing system and why you should change it! It does not give you any explanation on how to really change it or any example of quality manual or any thing of that sort!Don;t waste you money, just browse the net!"
5,Good headset for listening,"This is just a good basic headset for listening to things on your computer. There isn't a mic, which can be a pain if you don't need it. The volume control is extremely nice too."
1,This book does not exist,"This is a book that Orson Scott Card planned but never got around to writing. It was originally planned for publication in 1996, and a paperback version is supposed to come out May 30, 2005. If you order this item you will probably never get your book, or will instead receive a copy of ""Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus"", which BTW I thoroughly enjoyed.See Orson Scott Card's bibiliography:http://www.hatrack.com/osc/bibliography/index.shtmland the on-line discussion at:http://www.hatrack.com/cgi-bin/ubbmain/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=002253"
4,Nice Bikes,"The bikes are realy nice but the only problem is to calibrate the gears, and the wheels are umbalance soo you also have to fix that, other than that the bikes are good, do change the seats ther are realy unconfortable"
5,Can't believe I found this CD!!!,"I first purchased this album about 7 years ago in cassette form, and after being played so much, the cassette wore out. I have been trying to find this album for a couple of years now, and was always told that it was out of print. After placing an order with Amazon, I thought I'd search for this CD just for the heck of it, not expecting it to be available. Low and behold, there it was. Thanks Amazon for having the best selection of music in the world!!!"
1,Not what I expected,"Although both my parents RAVED about this book, it's definitely outdated. Something I forgot was to always always always buy the most up to date version of travel books. This was not what I was expecting. In my opinion, my smart phone with a Yelp app helps me out more than this book. What I was really hoping for a book with walks listed on the city. Such was not the case. This would have been great 10 years ago... but technology has since outdone this book."
2,Works but need a manual to set the time,"The watch is not bad, but I've lost my manual and can't fine one online. Can't figure out how to set the time. Heart rate works fine."
4,A bleak cold winter,"We visit the fifteenth century priory of St. Fridewides in a bleak cold winter in Margaret Frazer's book the Servant's Tale. all the sisters have caught the rheum (or flu) and a group of players(actors)bring in a badly injured man. His wife, Meg is a servant to the priory and badly wants a better life for herself and her children. This seems unlikely to happen with a maimed husband who was somewhat shiftless in the first place and given to drink.Before long we have a murder and the players are the chief suspects. Our medieval sleuth Sister Frevisse, wants to disprove this, because of her beginning friendship with this group of people.I was not as fond of this book as I was with the others in the Sister Frevisse series. Frazer does her usual superb research and brings the fifteenth century to life. Her characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them. This novel is very bleak and sad. I knew who was the villain immediately and hoped I was somehow wrong."
4,A riveting documentary,"I was not a fan of Russian culture or history, but when I saw this program on the History Channel, my fingers never picked up the remote control. I never channel-surfed once. There was more drama, intrigue, action, and violence in this documentary about REAL PEOPLE than in any soap opera drama. It reminded me that nothing imagined on TV or in the movies can compare with real people and events in history, which is why I ended up buying the DVD's. I'm not an expert on documentaries, but while the editing could have been a little better, I thoroughly enjoyed the content."
3,A good cover...,ProsGood ProtectionNice LeatherConsClick wheel access requires fliping the top cover
5,A must see for fans of Anime with a sense of humor,"As the main characters bounce from reality to reality, you'll see every anime cliche spoofed in outrageous fashion.From huge robots to dinosaurs to princesses and dragons to 1940s film noir detectives. It's all here and it all gets skewered. Meanwhile there is a serious story developing behind the scenes that is engaging in it's own right.I recommend this series to anyone that loves a good story and likes to laugh at themselves."
2,Not in first rate condition,"The great thing was finding an unusal item like this online without having to find it locally. It arrived on time, but the brass was pot marked in places. If I had time to exchange it, I would have returned it."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"Fan is very powerful which is great. Fan was shipped on time but with the wrong blades. Asked for correct blades and no response. Second request the correct blades were shipped. But the big problem is that the fan stopped working after about 3 months... and IT TOOK FOUR MONTHS OF EMAILS (many unanswered; some saying we are working on what to do) for them to tell me what to do...they gave me the link to Casablanca customer service. So much time elapsed that the warranty is not as good as it was. All it took was for someone in customer service to email me ""Go to Casablanca customer service we can't help you, here is the link""."
1,For chaplains only,I was disappointed to find this was written strictly for prison chaplains. I was looking for advice on starting jail ministry but this was not helpful to me at all. Very narrow field for whom this book will fit.
1,cold coffee,"This coffee maker made tasteless, luke warm coffee. The thermal carafe was good quality, but the coffee just didn't brew hot. Every mormiing we heated the carafe and our mugs, but still the coffee marginal. I finally had to go out and buy a second coffee maker. For $50 I got a Cuisinart maker that brews excellent, hot coffee. It doesn't have a thermal pot, but it is 100% better."
2,to big,THESE HEADPHONES WERE CHEAP. BUT THEY R GOOD. WHEN I BOUGHT THESE HEADPHONES I REALZED THEY ARE TO BIG IN SIZE. BUT THEY ARE WORTH. BUT FOR STREET STYLE I RECOMMEND BUY ANY OTHER MONITOR HEADPHONES FOR PAYING A LITTLE MORE.
3,"Good Price, Okay Headphones","Im sure anyone with little cash and wanting okay headphones will be plenty satisfied with these, but if you are looking for some real cans your going to have to take a jump into the $100's. Anyways, for anyone with some cash to spend and wants a pair of over the head headphones that are durable, comfortable, and with okay sound then the Sony MDR-280 is your set of headphones."
3,Wow.. how droll.,"I don't know if these headphones were worth the money. Sure, they're comfortable, but bulkly, lacking in power (but it is more crisp than the MDR V200s they replaced). i need some freakin' bass...maybe i'll just buy some REAL studio headphones."
4,Frank Foster carries on the Basie tradition,"I disagree with the poor review that someone else gave this cd.This represents the Basie Band in the late 80's, led by legendary tenor player, Frank Foster, who was carrying on the swinging Basie Big Band tradition. I saw this band live at the time and it was as swinging and as solid in musicianship as the classic Basie Band of the 50s.I believe that this cd is a fair representation of Foster's unit. The band swings, the sound is crisp and clean and the musicians bring a new vitality to these old arrangements. Shiny Stokings, Li' Darlin', Corner Pocket, Four Five Six and Whirly Bird are exceptional.The cd could have done without the two vocals by Carmen Bradford. The addition of four or five more tunes would have helped to fill it out and better represent Foster's Basie Big Band of the 80's.If you like the Basie sound, buy this cd; at current Amazon prices it's a steal!"
1,Bad Player,"I purchased one of these, looking for a player only to keep in my car. I found that it often wouldn't even read a disc, and skipped a lot. I was unable to nordic ski without it skipping on me. It also had a very very short battery life. I may have just received a lemon, but compared to my Sharp portable this one was horrible. It's worth an extra $30-40 for a better player."
1,Nice price but poor performance,This product was quite disappointing. The player skips often and the life of the batteries is short. One Duracell will play one 74 minute MD. The sound of the system is fine when working. The headphones are poor.
2,Not as good as I thought,"I bought this book in conjunction with the ""for Dummies"" book. The book is very dated. As such, the topics discussed don't relate to the up to date Mindjet software."
4,atmospheric series relies on acting for its thrills,"SAPPHIRE AND STEEL is a 1980s British sci-fi series with a very limited special effects budget. (Let's face it, it makes DOCTOR WHO look like STAR WARS.) That means that the leads have to sell the scares through acting alone. And they do. David McCallum's ruthlessly efficient Steel and Joanna Lumley's more sympathetic Sapphire create an atmosphere of creeping dread that does not need high-tech special effects to raise goosebumps. I recommend SAPPHIRE AND STEEL to all those who want to see two consummate professionals at work."
4,Very interesting series,I just finished the first disk and I think this is a very interesting series. Yes looking at it with todays's eyes it looks extremely dated. Joanne Lumbley and David McCallum are great. It will take me a while to get through all of the disks but I'm looking forward to them.
4,Skyjacker R225 Add-A-Leaf Springs,I bought these for my 1993 Chevrolet K1500 pickup truck. They were shipped quickly and arrived in good condition. Installation was pretty easy. The springs lifted the rear of the truck at least two inches. I had to adjust the torsion bars to make it look normal again. These add-a-leafs give it a little bit stiffer ride (but not bad). The truck handles better with the springs installed. I haven't tried hauling a very heavy load or towing a trailer since installing these.One thing that would improve this product would be plastic pieces for the ends of the leaves (like the factory ones) so they don't squeak. The DIY fix for this is to cut rectangles of thin plastic and install between the springs.Overall a good product. Bought from Amazon because of free shipping.
5,Excellent book for all unanswered queations.,"I really enjoyed this book! I couldn't put it down. It gave me more insight on how Brandon Lee was as a person and not just about his character and his death. This is definitely a must read, especially for Crow fans!"
2,Hillariously misguided,"This book cracked me up. In the Preface the author explains that she got dragged to the movie and thought it was okay but nothing special; then she heard that Crow-related stuff sold really well so she decided to write a book she says. In the Introduction which follows she tells how she contacted every single person involved with the movie -- and none of them would talk to her (well, okay, so two or three actually did, but none of the major players, she admits). But she decided to write the book anyway. The rest of the book is riddled with typographical errors.I enjoyed this book, don't get me wrong, but it offers nothing new and felt a little dry to me, written as it is by someone with no passion for the film or the comic upon which it was based."
5,Awesome,"If you loved the movie, you will love this book. It was so in depth, it answered questions i hadn't even thought of."
2,Only if you don't have better choices,"The premise was interesting--poaching of abalone--so the protagonist worked for Fish and Game. However, the story was disjointed, had gaping holes in the story line, and tried to include too many people. Was it a story about poaching, drug smuggling, or an evil hit man's revenge? Yes. Fish and Game, FBI, local police in several locations, informants who changed sides, suspects who helped in the end, and, oh yes, a marriage separation and a teenager suffering anorexia. Too much for a coherent tale.It was made more frustrating because of how it appeared on my Kindle. It was as though it had been moved from a magazine or newspaper that requires justified lines; hyphens were dropped in all over the place. There were other grammatical errors a good editor would have caught. I finished it because I'm basically stubborn, but I don't think I'll be looking for more Kirk Russell novels."
2,Only okay.,"With the story set in my own San Francisco Bay Area, I very much enjoyed the locations and appreciate manner in which he presented the problems of the Dept. of Fish and Game. I would never have guessed abalone smuggling could be more profitable than drugs. However, even with all the bodies and climatic encounter with Kline, I never felt the suspense of this book or a real involvement with the characters. All the bits were there-plot, dialogue, setting--but, somehow, I just did not have a visceral connection to the story."
3,"Not super motivating for me, but could see where it might help.","Diary was pretty costly for what you get. I think that I could do just as well with getting a blank journal and using that for my training notes. If you're someone who likes having the ""bells and whistles"" though with items-- this product may be for you."
5,Just began and loving it!,"I have just started to use this training diary, my 4th week, and it is wonderful.The feature I enjoy the most of all in the weekly entries is the amount of space available to write on each day's workout and performance! Plus, the daily weight recording area is big enough to include your body fat percentage too. The summary space is perfect for any comments that you have for that week's runs.This is my first bought training journal, and I look forward to filling it up!"
5,Portriat of a white boy,"The CD is very entertaining and his lyrics are better than most mainstream rappers. My question is, why is he still underground. I will be ordering the next 2 in the trilogy."
5,A fabulous read for parent and child alike,"As a parent of a toddler who is frustrated by reading countless rhyming books with poor meter and rhyme scheme, I found this book to be fun, droll, and extremely well-crafted. If you've been aggravated by the likes of Madeline and other books with poor rhyming, Spunky Monkeys will be a silly and easy read."
2,Doesn't work very well.,I bought these for my mother who has really bad arthritis in her hands. She had picked up a similar peeler somewhere that actually worked but it had broken.I hoped these would work also. The motor seems to work fine but the blades seem dull. I hope to somehow sharpen them so it works.Only works for the very lightest peeling job.
3,It's ok,"I was looking for french songs from french singers. As I'm not a fan I'll say it's an ""ok"" cd."
4,"Gypsy jazz from Portland, Oregon","If you like Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelly, you will like these guys. I have this CD and I have seen them play live, and they are a lot of fun. They have fun on stage, they are very in tune with each other, and they are masters of their craft. There are two guitars and a bass, and Gary plays a mean clarinet; he also plays a little flute and adds occasional nice clear vocals. If you want to see them live, go to the Laurelhurst Tavern at NE 30th & Glisan in Portland, Oregon any Monday night from 7PM to 10PM."
4,"Different from his other work, but a fun read.","Peter Mayle has written other books of his life in Provence, but this tale is a novel, complete with a hysterical plot, and, of course, meals that will make you wish you lived in France. This book is very entertaining, and a fun, quick read."
2,What a disappointment!,"Having enjoyed Mayle's previous books so immensely, I was thrilled to pick this up at a bookstore last year. What a disappointment to find it so lacking in the warmth and spontanaity of his others. I found little to care about the characters drawn here and kept hoping the next chapter would be an improvement. Even the descriptions of food and eating weren't as fascinating as A Year in Provence. Oh, well, thank you anyway, Mr. Mayle for your other books. No one can be perfect all the time!"
2,"""Chasing A Plot"" is More Like It","As a fan of Peter Mayle, I can't tell you how let down I was by this extremely slight, jetsetting-but-going-nowhere novel. I enjoyed the lighthearted A Year in Provence and Hotel Pastis, so I wasn't expected War and Peace by a long shot. But this (perhaps mercifully) short novel does nothing to evoke the landscape, whet the reader's appetite for fine food and gracious living, or even hint at character development. Too many stock characters (the dashing photographer, the take-no-prisoners editor, the perfectly pressed art dealer, the starry-eyed first-time-in-Paris ingenue). And the quick pacing leads to a disappointing denouement, which is -- sacre bleu! -- even more lackluster than the author's description of the colorful art which is purportedly being ""chased."" The extra star is only for my fondness of Mayle's other books: Otherwise, I'd only give it one. Two dreary thumbs down."
1,Unexciting,"I am not usually driven to mystery literature, but picked up this book on a whim. Now, sometimes mysteries have a very gruesome component, and some other times they are rated PG-13 or even G. The latter is the case with this book. This novel is rather bland, and it lacks the spice present in most ""grown-up"" mysteries. Also, i finished the book not understanding why there had been so many copies of the painting made. It was all very confusing, and i blame my confusion on not paying enough attention to the plot, and i blame that on the fact that the story line was quite insipid and lacked a little something.There are mysteries, and there are mysteries!"
3,Globetrotting & Cuisine A Plenty...But Little Mystery,"Chasing Cezanne by Peter Mayle is enjoyable for the same reasons his memoirs recounting his life living in Provence are so pleasurable to read: namely, his rich and colorful descriptions of this gorgeous area. Mr. Mayle is not as deft at spinning a smart and suspenseful mystery. He never quite manages to create that suspenseful charge that true mystery authors know how generate. However, I would definitely and without hesitation recommend Chasing Cezanne to everyone who counts themselves a fan of his Provence books. Mayle's writing is fluid and descriptive. He is adept at spinning a colorful yarn featuring his expertise in all things relating to travel and gastronomic pleasure. While reading this novel, I wished that I was sipping champagne in Paris or shopping for a baguette in Aix. He is truly without parallel in his ability to convey the essence of France."
2,Light...Too Light,"Bears hints of the Mayle style, but fails to deliver - in character development, plot, and charm. A light, fun read, but pales in comparison to Mayle's other books. Sorry, but any reviewer who rated this book highly either is not familiar with other Mayle options, or took the book far too seriously."
4,Solid player,"This player is an excellent performer with its anti-shock and extra bass options. Unfortunately, unlike its predecessors it offers little physical shock resistance, so you have to leave the anti-shock on or it'll skip when you set it down.It plays CD-R discs with no problem but has a strange quirk with CD-RW audio discs; it will play them 3 or 4 times but after that won't recognize them. Erasing and re-recording the disc does make it go away, but it's not worth it.The battery life is excellent, even with the anti-shock on. One feature from older Panasonics that I miss is the ability to quickly pull the AC/DC adapter out of the back of the unit while it was playing. The old ones switched to battery; this one shuts off.Don't buy this unit for the remote; wireless remotes on portable CD players are not worth extra money. Unlike wired ones, they get lost easily and must be pointed at the unit.The tape adapter works just fine and the AC and DC adapters run very cool . . ."
3,Not great...,"I'm a huge Meryl Streep fan so I'm willing to watch anything she puts out, but I didn't really enjoy the movie. Pretty anticlimactic."
3,Stressful. Good acting.,Thought I was going to see a comedy. Not so. Stressful marital relationship with many tears and fears. Production values were okay. Acting really good. But story is not fun.
2,Not really what I was expecting . . .,"With Tommy Lee Jones, Meryl Streep and Steve Carrell - this movie had all the potential in the world . . . but it sadly fell flat. Instead of highlighting the nuances of married life, the story primarily centers on the inability of the couple to have sex - not a plot line that can really carry a 2 hour film. I was very disappointed, and would not recommend."
4,Meryl Streep is wonderful...,"A funny and yet poignant story. If you are married and of ""a certain age"" this love story will ring true."
3,More like an uncomfortable therapy session,"This was listed as a comedy, but we didn't see many opportunities to laugh. The characters did a reasonable job playing their parts, but the story-line was tenser than expected, and graphic."
1,Terrible movie,Must have been very embarrassing for these great actors to see themselves in this very week movie. Very poor dialogue and very predictable script. One of the worst I have seen this year.
2,Wasted Talent,Maybe it's because I am a little long in the tooth myself. Not romantic. Not comedy. Not a sense of truth. It was as though the writer were imagining her parents' sex life but in the 1950's. A shallow made-for-TV movie only somewhat saved by brilliant actors. I want my money back.
2,Not Even Tommy Lee can save this movie,"10 minutes of story stretched to an hour and a half. If you like all of Meryl Streep movies, you will probably like this one. Otherwise, you see Tommy Lee Jones as you never want to see him again--as a boring accountant with no romance. The epilogue to the movie showed him happy, loving, and full of life but we never get to see him make the transformation.Steve Carrell is boring as the marriage counselor. Meryl is Meryl as a 50-year old old maid who happens to be married to Jones and cooks him bacon and eggs every morning. In the highlight of the show, she can't bring herself to perform oral sex on Jones in a theatre, and Jones runs after her telling her that it is no big deal.Just like this movie."
2,I don't understand these movies,"Save the marriage type movie. They are going to councilling to save their mariage, when all Tommy has to do is make love to his wife and sleep in the same bed? This movie is for Fred Flinstone and Betty, or is it Wilma?"
3,Hope springs was a disappointment,My wife and I just rented this and were let down. The movie never really took off and was geared for older couples in their 60's. I would pass on this one ad save your $5.
2,disappointing,"I was expecting more of comedy from the previews, perhaps along the line of ""Somethings Gotta Give"", with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. Especially that this movie had Steve Carell in it, The story line was not bad in itself, but it was more serious, about an aging couple with relationship issues. It was more of a Lifetime show, not something I would pay to go see or rent (like I did). There were a couple of parts in it I didn't need to see."
3,So so,"I had heard many positive reviews of this movie before actually seeing it myself. I was a bit disappointed in the content. Meryl Streep did a great job in acting. I felt the topic could have been presented in a deeper, richer way. Less emphasis on the actual sex act and more on emotional intimacy, which was the real issue."
3,Decent,It was a decent movie. I wasn't thrilled about the chemistry between the two. I have seen better from both.
3,"Sex, sex, sex","Do you want to watch a movie about your parents having sex? If not, don't watch this movie! I gave it three stars because it was very well acted. Top performances, but talk about uncomfortable. Awkward!"
3,Not Bad..,i watched this movie cause of my girl friend but its actually a nice movie. very touchy and funny at the same time.
3,Little Disappointing,"With these two veteran actors, I was just expecting a little more excitement.Wasn't a bad movie---just was not up to their usual standards"
2,Truly boring!,"This was one I had put off watching for a while, although I had looked forward to it because of it's story line and the stars. No matter how they tried--this couldn't be made less boring. Just a story line that went to nowhere till the last few magical scenes and the music, while really good songs, played so loud i felt like I might wake the neighborhood.Really---this was an unabashed turkey from 2 academy award winners. Can't imagine what they were thinking other than how big their paychecks might be."
5,Hope Springs,This was great movie. I loved Meryl Stereo and Tommy Lee Jones. It was great to watch it as instant video.
5,Hope Springs,I thought Hope Springs was an entertaining movie. I'm a fan of Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones. Good rental.
5,Such a cute movie!,Loved this movie! They picked exactly the right two actors to play in this movie and it is wonderfully done! Enjoyed it very much!
5,Couples who have been married 20-30 years will get something out of this!,"This movie made me laugh and cry, truly; I think it is because I found so much familiar in this story, in the characters, in the way they relate to each other. I think couples who have been married for 20-30 years need to see this movie. I found it inspiring and heart warming. Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep were amazing!"
3,A gift for me,Was nor really crazy ofver this movie.....but got good reviews. Will most likely sell for someone else to view. Some humor.
4,great picture once I got one that would play,"After ordering one &sending it back because I couldn't watch ,it and sent#2 back because I needed an update for my player I went out and bought the regular dvd.I was told by Memorex that they no longer made blue ray players????????"
5,life experiences,"Meryl and Tommy are at Twitter best. some really great ""ah ha"" moments. this felt like you were watching a real couple."
2,Great acting with a flimsy story line.,"This movie could have been so much better. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did a fine job portraying believable middle-aged characters along with Steve Carrell playing a sympathetic counselor. As far as an empty marriage requiring a 180 degree change, it was a believable plot line until their therapy only involved sex work with some really stupid juvenile tips that will bring on cringe-inducing moments. Rather than make a movie for 'grown ups', this production devolved into yet ANOTHER story built around SEX. Very tiresome when this had makings of greatness and could've been 90 minutes of marital counseling for the masses but instead was built around teenage fantasies for old people and how to rekindle sex at age 60 like an 18 year old. More gross than funny, let me tell you!"
4,Loved it but should be rated R,"My husband and I really enjoyed this sweet and funny story. A definite for marrieds at any age. The focus on sexuality/intimacy, though, and the frank talk around this made it entirely inappropriate for our younger kids generally allowed to watch PG-13. We didn't expect they'd want to watch it, but also didn't expect we'd have to lower the volume so they couldn't hear it!"
3,Just okay,Kinda disappointing. Meryl Streep & Tommy Lee Jones are both good but the story was just okay. Steve Carrell in a completely straight role was surprising. Thought it would be funny but no.
3,Disappointing,Two of my favorite stars - Streep/Jones. It's just a silly movie and the characters are awful. Pass on this one.
3,Trailer Was the Best Part,"The movie was good but not great. When it ended I was a bit unsatisfied, wondering, ""Was that it?"" I like the premise and the acting but the progression of the story was weak. I would have liked to have explored in more detail the evolution of a man's thinking process from complacent to engaged. But I must admit, I liked the ending despite the weak middle of the story."
2,disappointing,"From the little viewing they give you on tv,promoting this movie, showing,probably the only funny part..I have to say the acting was very good from both actors.. but the story was so demeaning to the Meryl Streeps character, all this energy she put into having her husband Tommy lee Jones become interested in her romantically again was just a little over the top...This reminds me of a movie produced in the 40's.. I have been married for 40 yrs. & know I would never go to this lenghts she did...it had a story book ending but boy did she have to fight for it!!!!"
1,snoozer,Thought this would be a much better movie than it was. Very slow and you see all of the funny parts in the perview
2,Cringe-worthy and boring,"I'm surprised by all the good reviews of this one. It's poorly written, trite, and has two-dimensional characters. About a third of the movie takes place in the office of the therapist, with Steve Carell in the utterly miscast role. These scenes alternated between cringingly embarrassing and snoozingly boring.Meryl Streep was terrible in the role, and Tommy Lee Jones was really hard to look at. Watching them pretending to try to have sex was just painful!!!I was really looking forward to this, as Meryl Streep is one of my faves, but I was glad when the closing credit rolled."
3,Hope Springs,"A little slow and plodding, but a relevant story. Many older couples will find this compelling. Well acted. I was surprised by the serious role by Steve Correll."
4,I enjoyed it,Definitely not a comedy although there are funny momemts. The performances from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were incredible - spot on in my opinion. Steve Carrell did well in a serious role. Really enjoyed it.
2,Comedy??? Really???,"Well acted but not what I was hoping for in a comedy. It was sort of depressing actually, I would not recommend this movie."
2,"Great cast, castaway in a shallow, knee deep plot, with no character development","I optimistically rented this. Tommy Lee Jones, Meryl Dearest Streep. I was bored, that's my excuse for going against the bad reviews. I kept waiting for the writers to break out of the predictable plot. Alas, alack. Meryl's character is barely intelligent, Tommy Lee Jones, was not even given that dignity. Steve is playing the passive therapist. Give them some lines. But not, if you jump to the vapid ending, you will get the gist, and you will miss nothing in between the first and last scenes. I would love to see them work with some real material."
1,Slooooooooooooooooow,I have been married a decade more than this couple and I could hardly take watching these two people. I guess the two great actors did good creating this couple BUT it was less interesting than watching paint dry.
3,Great Expectations,With these 2 stars I expected soul stirring dialogue. I found interesting dialogue I could identify with. It was a good movie to stream at home.
4,Pleasantly Surprised -,"Makes you stop and think ""it is worth saving"".. watch the movie and you will find out.Movie leans more towards being a chick flick but I really liked it."
1,Stupid,"An old woman whining about her husband's lack of sex drive..... Duh. guys lose interest after 70, get over it. Stupid, contrived and a pure waste of two talented actors."
2,Not Streep's best....,"The trailers looked like this would be a wonderful comedy. It wasn't.It was actually a more serious adult drama and lacks any humorous content.If you are thinking this movie is similar to Streep's ""It's Complicated""......you will be VERY disappointed"
1,horrible,"I expected so much more from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones. The story starts out pretty realistic and hard. Then, it just feels like they were running out of time, so jump to the happy ending. Howevet they couldn't cut the awkward attempts at oral sex. No way should this movie be rated PG-13. It should easily be R."
3,Hope Springs had no bounce,"Great acting, but even these heavy weights had a tough time moving this plodding script along. Made me feel uncomfortable to watch at certain moments."
4,Entertaining,Entertaining and interesting. I'm not sure it would appeal so people under the age of 50 or to most men.
5,Hope Springs IS Great,"IT was Touching, funny,and Streep and Jones are the best. I beleive some people in real life can relate to this movie."
1,"I love Meryl, but this one is a stinker.","The movie was slow, sad and never picked up. Sorry Meryl I love your movies, but I did not enjoy this one."
3,With seeing but slow,"The husband & wife appeared ""old"" for theirroles. Merrill Streep & Tommy Lee Jonesacting was below par, their script was alittle boring as well. However, Steve Carrelldid a great job."
2,Depressing movie...,"The actors are spectacular, don't get me wrong but if you are having ANY issues or pains in your current relationship or haven't healed from a past hurt, just walk away from this movie. It is incredibly sad and I honestly wanted to punch Tommy Lee Jones in the face about a hundred times for his attitude and dismissal. The best part of the movie is the last 3 minutes while the credits roll. This is NOT a feel good, uplifting movie."
4,If your over 50,"Good movie, I may want to watch again someday. Acting was pretty good and the story line kept me rivited."
3,Satisfactory,"A movie good for anyone married for 30 years+. You can relate to this situation and maybe even learn something.Hopefully, most couples are not as bad off as they two in separate bedrooms."
5,It's hard to rate this movie,"I am a video engineer and it was my first time streaming from Amazon, the quality was much better than I expected. Now for the hard part, content. The acting and story was too real for me. It was a mixture of my marriage and it damn near killed me."
3,About as expected,Streep was great as usual and Jones was sour as usual. I'm glad I rented it rather than go to the theater to see it.
3,Wanted to see an uplifting movie and didn't get that feeling after seeing the movie.,My wife and I wanted to watch a light-hearted movie about marriage and this was not it for us. Most of the movie was spent focusing on a severely dysfunctional marriage and a couple's attempt to repair it. Only in the last 15 minutes or so do you get to the feel good part. I think that the movie was a serious drama and that it raised some issues about problems that can arise in marriages. The image / poster for the movie gives the impression that it is more of a comedy and that I why I was disappointed.
2,"Slow, but instructive.","Great actors in many films, but we found this one slow and boring. As a comedy, it didn't do it for us. As a marriage therapy lesson, it does make good points."
1,Big Dissapointment,"My husbands 70 he didn't like the show, I'm 60, I didn't like the show, our daughters 30, she didn't like the show, I don't know anyone who did. It was boring, it was one last final reminder not to buy a DVD without first seeing it. What a slow, stupid movie."
1,bought but not received yet. I cans't rate it yet,"We bought this for movie night at our Club House in February. Since it is not here yet, I will revlew later. Mike"
5,Academy Award performance...!,"I thought this was an incredible movie. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did academy award-winning performances, and Steve Carrell did an incredible job as their marriage counselor...just incredible! The movie was so much better than I expected. I can't understand the negative reviews!! This is a great movie..!"
2,depressing,"Depressing, boring and slow. Not sure why it was advertised as a ""romantic comedy"".Just Tommy Lee Jones playing every character Tommy Lee Jones ever plays..."
3,Not real good,Gave it to my wife for a christmas gift we watched it and was not thrilled about the movie at all.
3,Decent movie,"I went into this not really expecting too much...but, it was a decent rental. I think the message and story line may hit too close to home for most people, which might cause some not to like it. But, I think it's worth watching, especially with such a good cast."
2,Painful Movie,"I am so glad I did not pay for this movie. It was sad, and painful, and uncomfortable, and... not good. My husband and I were very disappointed."
1,unlistenable,The previous reviewer was quite generous unless I have a particularly bad disc. I cannot listen to it. The crackling and scratchiness are beyond the worst recordings I have ever heard. I cannot even tell you how good the music is or isn't. Do not waste your money.
3,Great Gloves...For a Month or so,"These gloves fit great and they allow you to do detail work that usually can't be accomplished with other types of work gloves. The design is very well thought out, with the soft backing and extra grip on the fingers.BUT...I've ripped two seams after using them for only 2 months. And I don't even use them for the really sloppy work like moving wet firewood around or lifting concrete pavers. For the price, one would expect better durability."
1,Disintegrating gloves,"As many other reviewers have stated these gloves fall apart. I went through two pairs in short order when the ""washable"" synthetic leather literally disintegrated, the material stretched way out and holes showed up everywhere in the material. Lasted less time than much cheaper gloves I've owned.For a heavier glove I've had better luck with Ironclad's Icon line which seems to use a more durable synthetic for the palm."
2,Hope i can find something better,"These gloves fit very well, and are very comfortable. That's the only reason i didn't give them 1 star.I've been using them for weight lifting at the gym - not exactly work!After a few months, the palm stitching is gone in many places and one seam split.A ""heavy utility"" glove should last at least a year in the gym for me to spend this much money on it. Have to search for a different kind."
2,"The shoe is gorgeous, but...","I was sent the wrong size, NOT MY FAULT...but my money was refunded. I was disappointed because the shoe is truly GORGEOUS!!!!!!!"
3,It lasts FOREVER!,"I got this thing when I was 7 and I am now 11 and I still have it! And believe it or not it still works!! I have a different version of Dance Maker 2. Its the 2000 version, but its practicly the same thing. After 5 years of having and playing with it quite a bit, It still looks great and i dont think we have had to change the battery-maybe once.. Heck, we even moved 1 time from Ohio to Texas! This thing lasts forever!!! It gets boring after a few years but then you start to think about it and you play with it. It doesent take long to be a pro on this thing. Its simple but it lasts FOREVER!! On my 11th birthday I had 4 of my friends come over and they were 9, 10, and 11 years old and they all even liked it! I would recommend this if your planning on having it for a while. Like I said- I got it when I was 7, now im 11 and its still working and we MIGHT have changed the battery ONCE.. Great for parties! I say fopr ages 7 to 13."
4,Pretty Good Printer for the money,Considering what you are paying for it this is a pretty good printer for the money. Only issue I had was when I loaded the driver software it wasn't available in English. Saved by the fact that we have two of these printers in the office I was able to use the other driver disk. All in all a pretty decent printer.
2,pocket pressure turns on and wastes expensive batteries,"The LED is great because you can replace the batteries. Problem is it turns on due to pocket pressure and stays on killing the batteries which are quite expensive. Need a model that stays on by continuous pressure which preserves battery life. I find it ""on"" in my pocket too often."
3,Nice looking mouse pad,I was looking for a mouse pad for my wireless mouse and this one looks great and doesn't slide on the desk.
1,Wrong Size.... Smaller.,I was looking for the perfect size mouse pad for my desk and choose this one because of its size. I measured the space I needed and it would have been perfect if it was the correct size that was shown on the item description... but its not.
4,Great looking system,I bought this for my elderly aunt and it looks really good and fits in any decor. It is simple and has a remote. The radio is a little difficult to figure out but other than that it's a great system.
2,INTERESTING IDEA BUT QUITE THE YAWNER,A boy loses his grandfather at a young age and goes on a quest to figure out the meaning of life and why God does what he does. There's a mix of questions with Catholic High School Prep shenanigans as well as the typical conflicts a small kid would run into. I watched it for about 45 minutes and found it incredibly tedious. Quite a yawner.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: D plus to C minus; QUESTION FOCUSES ABOUT GOD: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: September 2011 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: C to C plus.
4,One of my daughter's favorites,"After repeatedly checking this bookut from the library I decided it was time to buy our own. We have read it so many times that my daughter is ""reading"" it to my 9 month son now from memory. She particularly loves the repeated ""WHAM!"" as Tucker crashes through the house. We have a wild dog of our own...It's not exactly a literary masterpiece or classic, but she loves it!"
4,"my 2-year-old loves this book, but it's annoying","I couldn't agree with another reviewer's comments more. My 28-month old aabsolutely loves this book. It makes her laugh out loud everytime I say WAHM and explain what Tucker did. However, I have to admit that when she asks for this book, I groan on the inside. The wording is kind of stupid with no real story line. But I read it... and she laughs her head off..."
1,Only buy this book if you loose your manual,Sorry I cannot agree with the above reviews. THis book is a total waste of money as it is no more than a rewrite of the information in the manual and you will be none the wiser on how to get the best out of your D70. If I didn't live outside USA I would return this book as it does not live up to its promise. For some reason this book is listed twice in Amazon - go read the reviews under the other listing - they too are on the mark - Skip this book!!
4,SMELL THIS,"I am a very ""smell-oriented"" person; odors can make or break situations for me. Therefore, I was really excited about finding this book. It was rather disappointing with only 10 scratch and sniff(S&S) places. Additionally, at least 9 of the 10 were ones you can still find easily. Herbal Essence Shampoo was my favorite since I haven't seen that around lately. However, I'm sure since I don't know how the S&S procedure is accomplished, it's probablyl much more difficult and costly than I would imagine. In spite of this, I did still have a lot of fun with the book and would recommend it to others for a slightly different trip down memory lane."
3,"Nothing new but, I like her!","There was no new information in there that you have not read before. But, she has a nice approach to the subject."
5,GREAT GLOVES!!!!!,"These gloves are worth what you pay, which really isn't that much. These gloves are great for everyday things, and work great in the shop. I've worn these for a while and they're really comfortable and hold there value. I encourage anybody to buy these glove. You'll be satisfied."
4,Pretty nice pair of work gloves,"I picked up these gloves a few years ago and I'm still using them. They primarily help me with gardening, yardwork, and light construction. The leather on the fingers has started to wear out, but they are still quite usable. The fit is accurate and snug; exactly what you want in a pair of gloves whose main goal is to reduce wear/tear and filth on my hands.I've since purchased a separate pair of Ironclads for heavier duty use and for operating equipment -- I'm just as pleased if not more so with them -- Ironclad makes some quality products!"
2,Officeconnect Wireless 54MBPS 11G Pc Card,"I purchased this card for my old HP laptop. The price was okay and the shipping was fast.My laptop has a built-in wireless card that supports only the WEP encryption.I wanted to use this card because it supports the WPA2 encryption as it is better than the WEP.I installed this card into my laptop's PCMCIA port with no problems and it did actually detect my router under the WPA2 encryption. The problem is this card couldn't maintain a connection for more than 30 minutes!I tried switching to the WPA encryption, it did improve the connection but it still drops the internet.I visited the 3Com's website for support but I did not find any solution for my problem because this card is discontinued from the manufacturer.I decided to return the product to J&R; store. So I called them and they provided me with instructions about the return process.I received a refund for this card (excluding shipping charges) after 3-4 days from the date I sent the item back."
2,Beware paint chips in your child's mouth!,"I bought these for my boys, ages one and three. They played them for about half an hour in the car and then brought them into the house. In just a half an hour, most of the paint on the metal had chipped off and I can only imagine that it went into their mouths and was ingested. These kazoos were made in China, Dongguan, as it says on the package. I have zero confidence in the paint used and if history is any indicator, it probably contains some lead. Thus, in less than an hour, they unfortunately went from package to trash."
1,30 Days of Night:Dark Days,"For those of you who loved the original ""30 Days of Night"" like I did.....stay very far away from this movie,this really sucked and NOT in the good vampire way. 2nd rate wanna be version,waste of money,very dissapointed."
3,Continuing story of 30 days of night,"I enjoyed watching this video as it continues where the first 30 days of night leaves you hanging. It has the gore of the first movie, but still leaves you at the end with no conclusions."
3,SUPER SILLY,"SUPER SHARK is another entry in the never-ending series of mutant killers, so you know you can't set your expectations high.This particular shark can walk around on the beach and even fly! It is released when drilling at an oil rig causes an earthquake. Of course, a seductive marine biologist shows up to investigate while the shark eats up most of the cast. Sarah Lieving (MEGASHARK VS CROCOSAURUS) plays the biologist; John Schneider from TV's Hazzard county is the shady oil company chief; Jerry Lacy (Rev. Trask in the original DARK SHADOWS) has a small role as Schneider's boss; and B-movie action hero Tim Abell plays the renegade boat captain who helps Lieving. Jimmie Walker shows up as a deejay at the local club who hosts (what else?) a bikini contest.The shark effects are appropriately cheesy and notorious director Fred Olen Ray obviously didn't take the movie seriously either.It's all Saturday matinee fluff but worth a few laughs."
2,Misleading title,"I was hoping for a book that would present some new slant on Aristotle's thought. I didn't get it. This is just another attempt by Heidegger to set out his own philosophy, with all of the tortured grammatical constructions and neologisms that one might expect. I think that Heidegger is most interesting when he's actually engaging other philosophers, and less so when setting out his own bizarre and flakey ideas. So if you're expecting to get some new insight into Aristotle, look elsewhere."
2,Consumer Beware,"The authentic K62634 surge protector of Kensington has a clamping voltage (UL 1449) rating of 330V. The items I received from Amazon with the same manufacturer's number had a clamping voltage rating of only 400V. Many of the manufacturers (e.g. APC, TrippLite) do the same thing in that they sell slightly lower-grade models with the same part numbers as their higher-grade models on Amazon at lower prices. Beware! Buy your surge protecters from other sources than Amazon. Otherwise, it is hit and miss."
5,Perfect for table top!,This table top power strip was perfect for our conference room and the long cord was a plus. We have 2 ten-foot tables in our conference room and it is able to sit in the middle of the tables with enough cord without having to add an extension. And the added colored sockets make it easy for associates to know what plug is theirs. In all I give it a 5 star rating!
5,all around power!,The Kensington 62634 power bar has been extremely useful during our quilt get togethers. The cord is quite long and we have the security of a surge protector. It has a very durable design and is made of top quality materials. I would highly recommend this power bar.
4,Super Cute,"First of all, I LOVE this product. When I bought it my husband jokingly said that it looked cute and small in the picture, but was really HUGE in real life. Don't tell him I said so, but he was right. It is huge and the cord is really long. Although I wish it was smaller, I still love it. It works really well when we travel and need to plug a lot of things in and although the length is annoying, it's very useful."
5,The BEST surge protector!,"A little of the expensive side.I have three of these in my office mounted to the wall.They work great, look good and are practical. High Joulerating is appreciated!"
1,The truth about this book,"This book does not explain the process of solving a caculus problem. They give you a theorem, never show you how it is solved, and expect you to learn from it. I would never recommend this to any of my students."
5,"Great item, hit the spot...",This is a high quality product that helps by showing great detail and simple format. It really strikes a nerve and builds the framework for easy understanding. I've bought others but never again.
2,Poor Recording,"A very strange selection. This Altissimo recording is just another re-release of material that is available from the military for free. Through a legal technicality - Altissimo obtains these recordings for free and re-releases them to the public without the military ensemble receiving anything in return. As a result, the disc contains a limited and peculiar selection of material that was never intended to be placed on a commercial CD. Buy another recording."
1,Magic Lantern: Canon Digital Rebel Guide,This book was the biggest waste of money I have ever seen. It's not even as in-depth as the docutmentation and instruction material that comes with the camera. I have never been so disappointed in my life. It's a great guide if you just bought a stolen camera and don't have the original manuals.
1,moronians,"If you want a good laugh take a look at chapter sixin this hastily compiled piece of trash. No one whodoes not already understand the material on octonianswill be able to penetrate this unannotated formulary.The same goes for the entire second half of the book.[The first half is just a rehash of material so familiarthat there is no need to see it in print for the N+1 st time. ]The only worthwhile entry here is the reference guidingreaders to John Baez's article on octonians which:a) is available free online andb) actually explains in a reader friendly way thehistory, math, and applications involved.The authors (not to mention editors) should be ashamedat such a sloppy treatment of this rich and historicallyinteresting episode in mathematics."
3,An average work.,"This work on Ephesians by professor Walter Liefeld does not pretend to be in depth or comprehensive. If your looking for more of an overview of the texts coupled with trite and witty commentary this work is for you.But be not mistaken. If you look for a comprehensive work on Ephesians from a conservative approach, purchase Peter O'Brien's new work on Ephesians in the Pillar series. From a more critical stance get E. Best's (ICC) work on Ephesians.Rick. E Aguirre Southern California USA (Aguirre100@aol.com)"
2,A serious flaw,"The Southwestern Bell Phone Model FM2575 is of good value and works as decribed but has a serious flaw that will reduce it's value to many people. As stated in the owner's manual, to retrieve the answering system calls remotley one needs to hold each digit on the remote phone 2 seconds to enter the security code. This is no problem for land phones, but for cell phones the tones emitted are not of that duration regardless of how long the button is held in. Another answering system would be a better choice if one would be using a cell phone to retrieve messages."
5,Best buy on jazz vocals,A strong line-up of Verve artists. Great variety. You'll want to play this CD again and again.
1,Two pairs in two months....,"I have now owned two pair of these gloves over the course of two months. The first pair of them had a blow out in the finger within the first week. I contacted the company which said that they would send me out a warranty card but never did. I decided to try again hoping that maybe I just got a bad pair. The second pair lasted longer but only about a month and a half in total, before serious tears started happening in the palms, the velcro strap came off one of them, and several other minor holes. These gloves are great while they last, but they are pretty expensive to keep replacing. I do remodeling, which doesnt always have me working with brand new material, but nevertheless I think I am going to try a different brand at this point."
3,Could be better...,"I don't work profesionaly, just on weekends with habitat for Humanity, and they are are good for that. I havn't had the durability problems that others have mentioned (but I havn't had them that long). The only other problem I noticed was when it was cold the golves were slippery, particularly holding a wooden hammer handle.But I really like the idea of these gloves, the short fingers make it easy to pick up nails."
2,Disposable Gloves!!,"I purchased these gloves based on a couple of good reviews, ignoring the few bad ones. The gloves were very comfortable right out of the box. They live up to the manufacturers advertising. Unfortunately, they lasted for four days of moderately hard wood working. Not construction ... wood working. These are expensive for disposable gloves."
3,Good Definitly could be better,Gloves were great but could not deal with real work.tThe stitching failed quickly approx.after 4 work days.Then after washing them the didn't last to long.If they improve the strength of the glove it would be a good pair of gloves.
3,The Joy of Home Wine Making,It is a good edition for the people who start making wine at home. A lot of recipes and iside you will get many details very importants for the begining. Cheers.
4,excellent and easy to read,"Harry Sheehy wrote an great book, here. It's easy to read, straight to the point, and provides valuable information and ideas for parents of children in sports. A read I would reccomend to many people."
5,Excellent Start,"I am a hobbyist woodworker. My first use of this kit was to put up crown molding. Installation of about 250' utilized primarily the finish nailer, although I did use the brad nailer a little on scarf joints. Both nailers operated flawlessly. I had no jams and found them both to be easily adjustable and straight forward to use.So far they demonstrate excellent functionality."
2,Ehh,"I have the brad nailer which is a fine tool. The compressor is OK. It will choke on a framing nailer. Mine has an occasional switch problem that causes it to bleed off excess pressure, but also run constantly.The narrow crown stapler? I wonder why they continue to make this model. It only handles staples up to 1"". The NS150 is the same basic tool body, but will take staples up to 1-1/2"".Sure you get a lot of stuff for the money. Thing is, not much of it is all that optimal."
1,Cheapo,This tool isn't worth it. The shield is made of the blister package material and the blades are cheap. An old fashioned hand circle cutter is cheaper and leaves a superior hole.
3,una herramienta excelente,esta herramienta facilitó mi trabajo vale la pena la inversión y la relación costo beneficio es el más adecuado no dude en comprarlo......
2,I Love Budapest,Probably this is one of the most boring movie I have seen for long time. Badly shot and edited... what else can I say!!! You should see it and learn from it... how not to make a movie like this. This is not even an arty movie!!!
4,"minimalistic, experimental, with emotional range","He's similar to Mouse on Mars, though more moody, a bit quieter and mellower. His samples are choppy, screechy, sometimes jarring and completely sporadic on the worse tracks. He can be playful, happier and sunnier (3,5,6), and uses his son's voice (4) with bells and amusing voice-based samples."
3,Serves its purpose. Interesting in small doses.,"Apt title; reads like a trivia reference book. Snapshots of molecules with brief recounting of history, chemistry and uses. Somewhat entertaining. Can seem dry. A decent coffee table book."
4,adorable,"This costume is so0o0 adorable. The material is good quality, doesnt look cheap at all. I found it a little pricey for being a baby costume, but, I guess its worth it since my baby looks so cute in it. I would reccomend it."
5,Cutest Halloween costume-ever!,I couldn't wait for Halloween for my almost 10 month old to wear this costume. It was AWESOME. I had about 20 people stop and tell us how cute it was. He was the only baby in an Elvis costume & I really liked it b/c it was different from all the other traditional baby costumes you find. It fit my son almost perfectly at almost 10 months (he is tall and good sized-he fits in 12 month clothes) to give you an idea of size. It was easy to put on him since it's a one piece with a zipper at the top. And you just add the belt & cape. We have the cutest Halloween pictures b/c of this costume.
1,"Stinky, sticky, and not warm!","These things stink, literally and figuratively. It actually smells when you open the package, and the patch itself has a sticky goo on one side that you are supposed to stick onto your skin. (You will get a light sticky goo all over your hands from applying the patch--and your hands will smell strongly of bengay.) But worse than that, these patches never actually get hot. They just ""tingle."" I have not found that stinky, sticky tingling provides any pain relief. But if you want your sore area to tingle, stink, and feel slimy for 8 hours, then this is the product for you. Personally, I will go back to buying Thermacare from now on. Thermacare patches are odorless, do not stick to your skin, and provide dry heat for 8+ hours."
1,"Too heavy, Belt broke after one year of use",I have used this vacuum for a year. Not a happy customer. Suction is not good for the price you pay for this vacuum. Belt broke after one year of use. I just ordered a different new vacuum cleaner.
1,junque?,"This vacuum has been a royal pain since day one. We gave it the benefit of too many doubts and today decided to throw it out and get a new one Kenmore, which we had for years before this and had good satisfaction. This one clogs too often, that turbo brush attachment is a joke, it rarely worked. I have never been this disappointed with a product. A real piece of junk. Today spent too much time trying to get the bush to work. So much for uprights."
1,Bissell 37601 Lift-Off Revolution Turbo Upright Bagless Vacuum,"A little over a year ago we bought our first (and apparently last) Bissell Vacuum cleaner. From day one we have had clogging issues with this vacuum. At first I was disassembling the thing to unclog it. Then we recently found some tools and allowed us to unclog it without a complete disassembly. You really need to provide a complete cleaning kit and detailed cleaning instructions with this model. We decided to not complain at that time since we did like the features of the vacuum and the way it worked when it was NOT clogged. Now, just yesterday (a little over a year since we bought it) when we started it up, I sounds like a 747 taking off! Since it is now out of warranty, we will just wear earplugs to protect our hearing and run it into the ground, then buy another brand of vacuum. We will not waste good money after bad on this piece of junk."
5,"Cleans really well, is a joy to vacuum now!","We earlier had a Hoover windtunnel, and after using this one, am scared about the amount of dust and dirt we used to live in. It cleaned up completely (in 1 round it filled the cannister to the top), then my husband ran it a second time, this time the carpet yielded half a cannister full of dust! My carpet looks almost brand new. The extension cord is the same size as our Hoover, so it seems ok to me. It cleaned our area rug, and as someone else mentioned, it actually changed the color of the rug. The noise is ok, most vacuum cleaners seem to be loud anyway. After losing the bags for our previous vacuum cleaner continuously, this bagless one is a Godsend! There is only one con, its heavy and not really self propelled. But for cleanliness and ease of use, I didnt mind losing these 2 properties."
4,great vacuum for the price,"this is a great value. It is much quieter than any other vacuum I have owned. It has great suction,sufficient attachments, and the best part is the lift off feature. this allows you do stairs without carrying the entire vacuum. The only thing I could think that would make this vacuum better,would be if the dirt container was larger and wouldn't have to be emptied so often."
5,This vacuum cleaner is great!,"It seems very powerful and gets up dust and pet hair really well. When the turbo is turned on, it practically pulls you across the floor. Although it's easy to take the cannister off and on, it's a little bit of a nuisance to deal with the power cord, which doesn't retract. Otherwise, no complaints at all."
2,Expect to replace and repair this vacuum often,"I purchased this vacuum a couple of years ago. I had to return it to the store within the first couple of months because the brush melted. Then, a few months later (and too late to return it this time), I had to have the new one repaired. A few months after that it lost all suction, started smelling terribly and I had to take it in yet again to get repaired. Each time I had it repaired it cost between $12 to $90... Mind you, I don't have any animals and I have a very small condo that I live in, so it's not like this vacuum was up to a lot of work. I just repaired it again and yes, it has LOST ALL SUCTION just a couple months later! The only way I can get it to work is to detach it from the main frame and use the attachments. Which really hurts my back. My solution? I'm donating it and buying an old-fashioned vacuum - the kind with the bags. I do not recommend this vacuum."
2,My Bissell Revolution Only lasted 3 years,"After having a Kenmore canister for 22 years, it was very disappointing to buy a Bissell Revolution 3 years ago. The small turbo brush only worked for a few months. After about a year the latch that holds the vacuum upright broke. This weekend I went to get it out of the closet and it just went click-click. No power. I don't have enough confidence in the durability of Bissell products to buy another Bissell vacuum. I'll try a Hoover or another brand with a good review. In reading reviews of other products, I find it pretty unacceptable to hear so many complaints of many different brands that break right away. Too bad I can't afford a high end vacuum."
3,works well,this product works well for it's price. the lift off feature can come in handy. bit hard to maneuver in upright mode (sideway tilt like a dyson ball or miele upright would be nice and i'd pay a bit more for that too.)sturdy product with a design that reminds me of Nascar race cars (which I am not necessarily a fan of)
4,Return on Investment from Training,Very good book. A necessary discussion topic in today's environment where everything in business is scrutinized more than ever for ROI. Many good ideas here for mining value and creating strong decision frames in regard to training based on strategic positioning and individual development tied to corporate goals.
5,I was so glad to find this book!,"After being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, and then told I wasn't allowed to exercise, my body has become stiff and its even hard to bend over to pick something off the floor. I'm excited to see how this will help me - each of the stretches focuses on areas that are specifically difficult to move after the pain has set in."
3,"Simple Relief is just that, simple","I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about a year and a half ago and have read everything I can get my hands on. With as debilitating as this syndrome is, I refuse to let it stop me and after almost a year of medication decided that I dont want to spend the rest of my life medicated. So, I have opted to treat my FMS by eating healthy, exercising and other alternative treatments (like acupunture). I bought this book thinking it would provide me with some additional guidances about exercise and movement. For me, the book was too simple. I already know everything it suggests. However, I do think that it could be something positive for those who are not moving or for loved ones of FMS sufferers, like my boyfriend who found the book quite informative."
5,Fibromyalgia: Simple Relief through Movement,"Excellent book for fibromyalgia sufferers. Since the author is also a fellow fibromyalgic, you are receiving advice from someone who knows in addition to educational information obtained through her profession. The information is provided in common layman's terms and is easy reading. The information is also common sense and assists you with your efforts to manage your fibromyalgia, instead of ""it"" managing you. I have recommended this book to other fibromyalgics and they loved the book as well. Fibromyalgics need to educate themselves about this condition in order to continue living their lives as normal as possible, so do not rely solely on this book, but it should definitely be included in your fibromyalgia library."
1,never ready,"Bought some 20 years ago - didn't work right out of the box, bought some today, they didn't work right out of the box. How does this company stay in business?"
3,Very thin.,"Although single malt whisky taste great out of the Riedel glasses and the liquor hits the right part of the tongue the glasses are extremely thin and too light.They are very easy to break, lost one within the first week of use and second a couple weeks later.I bought Villeroy@Boch single malt glasses and they are more sturdy, well balanced and have a more masculine shape."
3,Depeche lost its gothic Mode,"Depeche Mode has always added a gothic style to their music, but this new single and the rest of the songs in the new Exciter album, shows DM moving away from it all. The songs sound happy, or ""excited"". They're moving away from a dark and mysterious style to a more fast-paced rhythm. I have enjoyed every album from DM...even Songs of Faith and ULTRA, though I don't think I will ever get used to this one. ULTRA was someting very new for DM, yet it was one of my favorites because of that gothic style it had. But as a true DM fan, I can always adapt. At least DM lives on..."
2,A B-ALBUM--AS IN BAD MEANING TERRIBLE,"WHO THE HELL ARE THESE GUYS GIVIN' THIS WASTE OF PLASTIC A 5-STAR REVIEW?IVE BEEN A NON-PHIXION FAN SINCE 2000 AND I ADMIT GORTEX HAS AN ILL FLOWUNIQUE VOICE AND HE DROPPED ILLN VERSES ON DA NON-PHIXION LP AND DA MIX-TAPES. BUT THIS ALBUM REMINDS ME OF A CORNY B-HORROR MOVIE WITH CHEESYBLOOD EFFECTS THAT LOOK FAKE,AND WHEN GORTEX RAPS ABOUT MURDER AND FLYINGBODY PARTS..HE SOUNDS FAKE. YEAH THERE'S SOME DECENT TRACKS SUCH AS ""THEART OF DYING"",""BORN OF FIRE"",""REP TO DEATH"", BUT DAT'S IT. GORTEX DIDN'TUSE TO RAP HORRORCORE LIKE THIS, I GUESS NECRO HAS A STRONG INFLUENCE ONHIM. IF NECRO WAS HIS FRIEND HE WOULD HAVE NEVER PRODUCED SUCH AN AWFUL LPFOR HIM"
1,Are they kidding?,"This may be the most disappointing, dysfunctional electronic item i have ever purchased. Doesn't work at all, not even a little bit. The static is so loud that the music cabn't be heard. Forget it!!!"
2,Not as good as the Belkin Tunecast II,"I liked the new display....but that's about it. Ive had my Tunecast II for 2 years and have been pretty happy with it(always hated the auto shut off feature on it!)until the wire broke off........So I decided to plunk down the extra cash to try out the newer model. All I can say is it feels flimsy and the wire is thinner then the Tunecast II. But I was most disappointed with the performance of it, the older one has a stronger signal....and you can forget about the stereo feature, it's utterly useless!! I returned it and decided to try the Monster Radioplay 300 because of all the good reviews and I must say that I couldnt be any happier with it!"
1,Craptacular,Sort of works on 90.1 in Austin but any other freq is worthless. Even on 90.1 it has a very poor frequency range. You'll get better quality music with an 8-track.
1,Disappointing piece of junk!,"How do I even begin? I had such high hopes for this but was frustrated. The sound quality varies depending on where you drive, where you put it in the car and especially sounds bad when you first start the car, for no reason at all! No matter where you place it in the car, all you hear is just static! Please don't waste your money on this trash!"
2,Not that good.,"I live in a small town, Fort Wayne, IN with small number FM stations. Yet I have to continuously find a channel if my car move within a city or if you change to an opposite driving direction such as north to south. Another problem is where you place it in your car. You cannot just simply plug, search and play. You have to use a velco-sticker to place it very close to the car stereo. The ideal place is right below the steering wheel.If you are not able to multi-task while driving, don't buy it. I will put on this on auction soon."
3,One size,This product shipped quickly and arrived as promised. My only problem with the item is is that it was sold as one size fits all/most. The bands around the tops were very small and became extremely tight when pulled up into place. They should be sized more appropriately.
3,warning for Bay Area residents,"I can't really give a rating in stars, as I just started this book. (I read his previous novel and liked it pretty well.) But I'm having a hard time getting past the description of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake with which this book opens. (No, we don't call it the ""Great San Francisco earthquake of 1989."" It was centered further south, closer to Soquel and Aptos.) If you were there, as I was, you know that much of his description is exaggerated horse puckey, although the death count is accurate."
2,Disappointing sequel,"I loved Eddie's Bastard, and even re-read it before emabarking on SSOH. Unfortunately, I feel that Billy got lost. He seemed a battered and embittered soul--so unlike the young man in the first novel. He departs to New Mexico seeking his mother, yet doesn't have the courage to tell her it is him. His releationship with Consuelo is based on chemistry, and no other character is drawn with any depth. Particulary El Perrero, who seems to be there to make Billy question what his own father would have been like if he had lived. The ending is hokey--to the extent that the Mann mansion is a home for unwed mothers. Billy grew up with love, even if the style was unconventional.I was also aggravated that this novel covered such a short period of time--and the ending with the pregnancy and completed novel seemed far too open.It was an easy read, but not nearly as fulfilling as Eddie's Bastard."
2,"Does not capture the mood or characters of ""Eddie's Bastard""","I was disappointed with this sequel. It covers Billy's quest to find his mother. The plot was very contrived and just didn't ring true to me for some reason.Billy ends up in Santa Fe to look for the mother who abandoned him. He meets Consuelo, a singer and they fall in love. Billy locates his mother, but the woman he has created in his mind, can she meet his expectations?? I thought the love story was a bit simple, as was the ending.Kowalski would have had to do a smash up job with a sequel to top ""Eddie's Bastard"". He did not succeed, but I will likely read more of his work in the future, since sequels are usually a letdown in most cases. I didn't hate the book, or the plot, but it left me empty, therefore I give this book 2/5 stars."
1,Poor Customer Service,I never received this product and the seller never responded to any of my enquiries.
5,Kill Me,"This was the first Stephen White book I read. When I realized it wasn't his first, I went back and started with book one, but this is the book that got me hooked! I absolutely love his vocabulary! Most writers tend to reuse words and phrases that become evident when you read several books by the same author, this is not true, however, with Stephen White. Each book brings on a new and exciting story, as well as a whole new set of vocabulary words to learn."
5,"Absolutely a must read..again, and again!","I don't care who you are,or what your favorite genre is, you MUST read this book! It's original..unexpected...touching..and the ending will blow you away! Don't let the title throw you off. It's one of the smartest, tightest action thrillers to come along in quite a while. This is the kind of book you can't wait to turn your friends onto. Buy it...NOW!"
1,Is there a ZERO star option?,I have loved the Alan Gregory series up to this point.....this isn't really an Alan Gregory book. He appears for only a few short pages. This book was outrageous and so far over the top that I had to force myself to complete it just to see how it ended. Not that I cared but I had paid for it and wanted to complete it. I know Stephen White can do better. If you have read only this book and did not like it do not let that deter you from purchasing other Alan Gregory books by Mr. White. They are usually a good read.
4,NOT an Alan Gregory novel,"So last night I finished reading Kill Me by Stephen White, and I was right in my assessment that Alan Gregory's presence in the story is little more than White's attempt to get his regular readers to read this book. The book is really actually very good. The action is intense, and the descriptions compelling. While the ultimate message is about hope and how we confuse a lifestyle with living, it takes a long time in coming and when it does, it crashes with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. I missed Alan's self-effacing inner dialogue and deep love for his family that runs through the other books in the series. The main character in this book never creates much empathy. The ending was confusing and yet too pat at the same time. You don't need to read this book to stay current with the Gregory series, but I wouldn't skip it either."
2,Just average - had expected more,"Title and cover text promised more than the book contained. Author expects you to get through boring shrink sessions, where narrator for no reason choses not to reveal anything, not even what you already know from title and cover text. If you manage to get past this point, about 200 pages, it gets quite interesting, and a real page turner, two stars of five for that. To me as a European, it appears to base on lots of unreflected US American stereotype perceptions about ethics, sex and moral codes, which might be what US readers want, but left me somewhat disappointed. For those who seek an alternative, similar action, shrink and chase involved, check out The Analyst by Katzenbach.The Analyst"
1,"a sad, dissappointing purchase","This was a sad, dissappointing purchase. From the description, I expected that this would illustrate how to integrate Crystal into reporting applications. While a cursory attempt was made at showing you how the most very basic integration could be accomplished, this title sorely lacked detailed, useful information that could be applied to real-world applications. In addition, it rambled on about material not even related to report integration and was definitely NOT worth the money."
4,Gives Alternatives to Enterprise........,This book could have had better examples and more screen shots but what I liked about it is that it gave alternative solutions to web enabling reports. Visual Basic and Active Server Page alternatives can save my company a lot of money over the Enterprise solution that Crystal presently offers. I do like the point and click options of Enterprise too. What I liked about this book is that it doesn't limit you to one option.
2,Fluff,"A big disappointment: lots of academic fluff, atrocious prose, and little substance. Most everything in here is not new, overly complicated, lacking examples or interesting insights. It's more of a compendium than anything, but who is it written for? It's too simple and basic for scholars, too elevated for beginners, and certainly both too basic and too badly written for writers. I'm sorry to have to give such a bad review to what obviously took someone a lot of effort to compile, but I find nothing useful in this book except if someone wanted to have a quick reference."
3,"Sound machine, but should be better for the price","Purchased three years ago for a small home shop. Be sure to check belt tension during initial setup. Soft plastic dust covers are easily damaged by retaining screws and sanding belt. The toggle switch seems inadequate and sometimes leaves the machine running after turning off the machine. When the switch completely stopped working recently a replacement cost $34.00. Overall a good machine, tables and gauge slots are true."
5,Great information! Great approach for more fearless birth!,"The cover got my attention. The content got it into the hands of my daughters. A friend recommended Blooming to me because my daughter is having a baby in 4 months. I read it, and learned so much I didn't know, even though I had 4 children. I want my daughters better informed. This book has an entertaining way of giving marvelous information in a concise, fun way. It is a book for the busy woman of today, who wants to pick it up when she has time in her busy schedule. These two women are very informed and ""today"" women. There is no doubt they have ""been there, done that"" and have much to impart. Where was this book in my day?!"
1,crap,The first 5 minutes of this video covers gases. the rest of the video is about solutions. I tried to use this video to present gases before I taught it but it wasn't even cohesive for a lesson. It bounced around to different topics and the format just confused my students more.Maybe I will play the solutions DVD and find the info I wanted about gases.[...]
3,Pocket Guide to: Occupied Japan,"This book is good it has a wide variety of items made in occupied Japan shown. The pictures are in color and very well done and I found them to be the best part of the book. This book has very little history and does not tell much about the different marks or why there are so many different marks used on the occupied Japan items. This book does state that if items arrived in this country with no mark, a rubber stamp was used to add the mark. The book also states that a few unmarked items did slip through but these items have less value without an Occupied Japan Mark. This book shows the prices on the same page as the item and states ""The purpose of this book is not to set firm prices but to serve as a guide."""
2,Selling snow at Christmas,"Although I haven't read the book, it seems that one can attain its flavor by examining the content displayed above at top of page. All the information presented can easily be gleaned from the internet and one wonders how complete the book can be if it has lopped off significant galleries, as per its index, such as Gogosian and Louis Meisel Galleries, among others. Perhaps the author has no real familiarity with the galleries listed, or so it seems."
2,Disappointed,Was hooked from the start but where was the ending????!!!The book feels as if the writer didn't know how to complete it.
5,Mike Brant 20eme Anniversaire,"I discovered Mike Brant by accident on the Internet, loved his voice, and bought this CD. His voice was wonderful, he had an excellent range. There isn't a song on this CD I don't like, I can highly recommend him. It's hard to come up with a description of how wonderful his voice was, listen for yourselves!"
4,Decent theory/scale book,"It is what it is, the information all seems to be in there, could possibly be laid out better, I don't know for sure though. I've not gotten all the way through it, but it seems with some practice and dedication this could improve most anyone's understanding of music theory and chord/scale relationships."
3,Scary,"Installation, setup, operational were all exceptional. For 15 days. Then the transmitter quit and my customer service nightmare began. They teased me with a free 800 number that was disconnected. I tried the free chat, and was told that they didn't support this product thru the chat. So, I tried the 900 number referred in the 800 number for $9 a pop. After accepting the charge, the number went to directory assistance. I resigned myself to return the product (again, a 900 toll number) and was finally directed to customer service, after bouncing around a few people I was told to download the new firmware. I downloaded same, and the WAP started working! I submit that Linksys would do their customers a service if they were honest about downloading the latest firmware, and not so inclined to milk them for $."
1,WAP4400N POS,"I purchased two of these AP's. they are a POS. They constantly need rebooting. I upgrade firmware and it doesn't take the change. Tech support tells me to reset the AP to factory defaults after upgrading firmware, which I try and the firmware still does not upgrade. When they work they work ok except the WAP mode did not allow wireless clients to attach, only the bridge worked. I only use them as a point to point bridge now and still it's reboot, reboot, reboot."
2,Avoid the WAP4400N,"The WAP4400N is acceptable, but the WAP4410N is much better... It has the new Cisco Web GUI interface and supports more advanced options like VLANS and multiple SSID."
5,my son loved it,"I bought this for my son when I was pregnant, he immediately took to it and loves on it all day. He holds it by his tail! I have been looking everywhere for it and there are a lot of people out there looking for this dog. There was a website with a long list of people looking to replace this dog for their child but could not find it anywhere. I am ordering two! washed it and it came out clean and looking brand new. very durable."
4,Lovable toy dog,My year-old granddaughter is enamored with dogs and this stuffed dog has been eagerly embraced as Dog-Dog. It is all the description promised and I am very satisfied with all aspects of this transaction.
3,Not time for a review....,"This story isn't over yet - and I can't say conclusively how good it will or will not be. I will say that the first book in the series was very good and I am looking forward to the sequal coming out next year. I have been so dissapointed with this ""Invaders From Mars"" type of Sci-Fi in the past, that I almost didn't take this one off the shelf. However, I've read both authors work in the ""Star Trek"" genre and loved it so much that I figured I'd give this one a try. I wasn't disappointed by any stretch of the imagination. I hope that this series can succeed where ""Independence Day"" and ""Footfall"" by Larry Niven fail. So far its off to a great start."
2,So disappointed!,"I have had a black-tanked Bunn for years and loved it. After much service, it recently died. Because of the excellent service in the past, I purchased three velocity Bunns for Christmas. Two for my daughters and one for myself. I am so disappointed! They leak when pouring hot coffee all over-the-counter, and do not perform nearly as well as the original model."
5,pleased,The Bunn BX-Classic 10 cup home coffee brewer in the black silver tones was the best buy for gift giving to my daughter and her husband. They absolutely love it. I have had a Bunn for years and wouldn't use any other coffee maker on the market. Excellant product and I recommend it to all coffee drinkers out there who don't like waiting for their am fix! :)
5,Quick and hot coffee!,"The Bunn has been a tried and true coffeemaker for us as this is our second. Our first of the same model lasted around twelve years. It is easy to use, no fussing with settings. Just fill the funnel with a filter and coffee, fill the decanter with cold water, pour the water into the coffeemaker and it's good to go. Just remember not to overfill the coffee filter with grounds - the grounds could overflow and cause a mess. I use 1/3 c with each pot and that works really well."
4,Would be Five Stars If,"If it had a timer to turn of the energy hog ,always on tank heater this would be a Five Star coffee maker. So they lost a star for the fact that I had to buy a separate timer as we only make coffee in the morning and if we want some on that odd occasion when the timer is off it heats up in less than five minutes, takes almost that long to grind the coffee.Fast ,always good cup of coffee and for those who use an extra fine grind they will send you out the slower rate head so it does not overflow the basket."
4,BUNN BXB Velocity Brew,This is our third purchase of this coffee brewer. Wel purchased it again because it makes good coffee and the coffee is available almost immediately. We were hoping it was still available in white but could not find it. The BUNN arrived very promptly and in perfect working order. We would order it again and would recommend it to others and that they can order it from Amazon.
5,BUNN coffee maker,"Great coffee maker, after 3 weeks use the spray nozzle fell off and must have been thrown out will the grounds. Called BUNN and they shipped me two replacements spray heads. I would check your new unit and make sure yours is tight. Love the coffee!"
3,"good information, relentless point of view","I appreciated the information presented in this book but the political point of view of the authors is continually pressed upon the reader through the examples chosen and the wording in the text. In other words, the rhetorical stand of the authors gets in the way of what they want to say about rhetoric! A textbook should be written to illustrate the subject in a balanced way. The reader ought to be able to read such a book as this one and end up knowing absolutely nothing about the political views of the authors and much about the subject of rhetoric. I felt like I had been beaten over the head, that a point was intended to be made quite apart from enlightening the reader about rhetoric, a pity because there is much good material here. For an example of proper balance, I'd recommend anything written on rhetoric by Prof. David Zarefsky."
5,great fit,Its just what I hoped it would be and more. The camera with a 18-70 lens fits and carries great and I was surprized when I found a pouch for the lens cap or filters
1,advc 110 burned,"I bought this ADVC110 over a year ago (no warranty now). I have tried to use this without a firewire cable and different types of video editing software. Never got it to work and I never wanted to get that involved with the video editing software. I,m just trying to take my Sony Hi 8 tapes and digitize them so they can be watched on the television. I don't want to use the camera, I need it to digitize the tapes. When it fails, all the tapes will be useless. Anyway, I finally found a firewire cable that didnt cost $50 and tried again. Guess what! As soon as I plugged in the firewire cable in, it burned up! I could smell it. So now I have a converter that costs me over $200, I never got to use it, and the won't replace it because it's over a year old."
3,3 stars only due to price,This thing works exactly as designed... but the price is so high for what it is!I bought it to convert family movies from VHS/8mm to DVD.It functions just like a DV camera once hooked up (I used a Mac w/ iMovie)
1,Canopus 77010150100 ADVC110 Converter,I had tested Canopus ADVC110 Converter on both the fastest PC using Premiere Pro 2.0 new version and Macbook Pro using Final Cut Pro 5.0 This device is not stable and the video is jerky.
1,"DOA, No Customer Support","Received the unit on-time, but due to travel I did not attempt to use the ADVC-110 until about a week after delivery (caution: ""The Recording Store"" returns policy is void only 3 days after delivery, so be warned!). The device does not work, The Recording Store will not take it back, and Canopus ignores requests for assistance/returns."
3,Upset that it didn't come with bulb and not 500watt,I purchased this product and ordered one day shipping as I needed it within 7 days. I get it and first theres no bulb with it as advertised. So I call customer service and ask what bulb I need to get. Then got upset when it is advertised as a 500watt and its only 250 watt and the guy told me that on the phone. Then he asked if I wanted to order a bulb from them. I was already upset so found a local camera store and got 5 bulbs from there.The light itself works fine which is why I gave it 3 stars but the misleading info sucks...
4,Excellent writing style for the adventure,"This book could easily have become a boring iteration of each of the gazillion rapids encountered in the Grand Canyon, but it never became that. The writing was, as another reviewer out it, lively, and the book was a joy to read. These guys were so inadequately equipped by today's standards, but that was so much a part of the adventure. They were very careful to make sure that they swam every inch. It would have been so easy to climb around some of the worst of the rapids (like Lava Falls), but, after surveying the impending danger, they were careful to reenter the water where they came out so that they could never be accused of cheating."
5,Made to be sung in French,"I saw a clip on the internet of the French version of the movie Sleeping Beauty and was enchanted! There isn't much singing on this soundtrack, but the clip I saw were the songs ""I Wonder"" and ""Once Upon a Dream,"" both of which are more beautiful sung in French than in English in my opinion. As for the rest it's all the same beautiful soundtrack from the Disney film adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet, and the voice recordings in French were done back in the 50s when the movie was made. Highly recommended if you like Disny soundtracks, Tchaikovsky, or French songs!"
5,Fantastic!,"I have had this CD for quite a while and it is time to make a statement. This is one of the best CDs I have ever heard. I can't understand why, so I'm not going to pretend that I do. I can listen to this CD time and time again and never get sick of it. Maybe it is the infectious rhythms or the sometimes-poetic lyrics (i.e. ""your eyelashes wish their way to the floor""), all I know is that this album is fantastic. Listen to a few clips here on Amazon, give it a try. If you even remotely enjoy what you are hearing, I suggest you pick it up."
2,"Some good stuff here, but basically a collection of articles","First chapter is quite good on the basics of American Exceptionalism as Lipset sees it. But the rest of the book doesn't hang together very well. As previous reviewer noted, the chapter on intellectuals is quite interesting, and so is the chapter on Jews, but they don't fit in to any overall argument. These chapters were all published in many places over a considerable period of time, and it shows. Not a coherent work, but an interesting first chapter."
2,wrestling ring,Steel cage is alot of fun. Hinge for the ring when folding and the turnbuckles both broke right away. Seems not worth the money.
2,remanufactured dmr/everything is in french,"i tried to change from french to english & i have been unsuccessful. who ever set it up for the first time selected to get all messages & menus in french...unfortunately i only speak english & a little spanish. i don't know when i try to execute a function if it is the right action or not. i need help, but have not been able to get anyone at the panasonic help desk, wait times too long, getting nowhere on the website either"
2,Flawed design - but saves on propane!,"Well, I'd have to say this product does do what it was design to do - it cooks eggs, bacon, and pancakes fine. But, there is a major design flaw as far as I'm concerned. When you cook something with lots of grease (e.g. bacon), the grease just runs off the sides through the holes (visible in the picture) into the body of the grill with the burners are. It then ignites creating a turbo cook mode! I was able to turn the gas off completely and cook the entire meal off bacon fat. As 'green-friendly' as this maybe, I really didn't care for the approach. What a MESS to clean up!If you only plan to cook eggs or panacakes, it works fine. Just make sure you have it PERFECTLY level. I lost an entire egg through one of the side holes due to a little slant. You can imagine what my stove looked like after this breakfast ;-)"
5,Fishy Fun!,"This super cute, oversize picture book will be a big hit with your little ones. The bright colors in the illustrations are fun and inviting.There is just enough text on each page to keep things moving so that young children will stay interested. The vibrant colors and silly words are what make this book such a treat!"
2,Not engaging enough,"I purchased this book for my 2 year old grandson,but he had no interest in it at all. I think I would have liked a more interactive format."
3,"OK, but you get what you pay for","This machine is truly average. It does an average job of receving faxes, sending (although anything more than 3 sheets in the tray and it often picks up more than one sheet at a time), average or slighlty lower than average photocopying. Callers have told me that the sound quality on the handset is only fair. And the ""speaker"" feature is mis-leading in that you can only use it to dial or listen (not speak); it is not a speaker phone. The film cartridge does not last long and is very inefficient. ...I think I got my money's worth, but no more."
1,"grandson says ""it's junk""",Sent as a gift to my grandson. He reported that on the first flight the wing broke and could not be fixed.
3,Too small for a bar tray,"It just doesn't fit my ice bucket and wine bottle together. I can only place several glasses on it, I feel like I wasted my money this time"
1,A disappointment,"After all the glowing reviews, I decided to get this book, and I am disappointed with it. There are no new ideas here (nothing I haven't seen for years in my favorite magazines and other decorating books). (A cake stand as a soap dish? Gee, I think I got that idea out of Better Homes and Gardens or House Beautiful, like, ten years ago!) The settings look fussy, busy, cluttery, and old ladyish. My mother might like this book but then again she might not. Nothing new and kind of a throwback to where decorating was several years ago. I suppose the book is really intended as a kind of catalog in disguise, since it was done by a store owner,so maybe I just expected too much."
2,A hopeless intellectual exercise,"I gave two stars to be charitable. The authors assume an incredible amount of background knowledge on behalf of the reader, in fact the book is more a review of this assumed knowledge rather than a tutorial or exposition of the topics. Equations and symbolic logic are incorporated needlessly to explain many simple concepts, but when applied to complex topics, these same rigorous techniques are given no supporting explanation. If you can follow the non-explanations the authors provide, you likely have already mastered this subject area and don't need to read this book at all. If you are new to the field, you will be stumped by the shallow coverage of complex theory, and this is even for people with graduate level computer science or mathematics. These authors need a better editor, someone who actually cares if the reader has any idea what is going on."
5,Great book about relevant topic,"The internet and the web have become a wonderful field for applying mathematical methods to huge amounts of uncontrolled information. The ultimate contribution of this book, I think, is to present techniques by which results that are meaningful and useful for people -- such as text analysis and categorization, or relevance of web pages, or recommendation systems -- can emerge from the application of cold mathematical formulas. The mathematical tools are not necessarily new and may be hard to follow by non-experts (this is mostly Machine Learning, probability, etc). To fully appreciate the book, one needs to grasp the math, but I think the text is sufficiently interesting so that the book can also be enjoyed by people who don't like to read the math. The book is fairly comprehensive about modeling important processes that happen everyday on the web."
2,Not for the beginner,"If you're not an experienced photographer with lots of equipment, this is not a book for you. I got it, hoping to improve my photos of flowers, but honestly, I can't even understand what he's talking about. Obviously to get anything out of this book, you need lots of equipment, and lots of know how. If you're just a gardening and photo amateur, don't bother."
1,Old works,"I like tony sweet's work a lot.I have several of his books including the old version of this one. If you don't have the old version this might have some value. If you do have the old version, skip this one. It's not worth your time or money."
2,Fine Art Flower Photography,"The color illustrations in this book are quite attractive and show that there was a lot of time, effort and skill expended in their creation. However, the text was written on a far more elementary level than I expected . It would be more helpful for the beginner than for an accomplished photographer seeking new methods and/or techniques to sharpen theirinterpretative skills."
3,Telling You How It Is,"This Mousepad smells. What's worst is that the smell gets onto your hand after a while. It works though...I mean it's a mousepad...it would be hard for it to not work. It looks pretty cool with all the water drops but...man...that smell...BTW, I've had two...they both smell."
2,Could be so much better...,"Where is the intrigue??? Vampire is a game of double dealing bastards, backstabbing worms, wonderfull plots...particularly Kindred of the clans Ventrue, Tremere, Lasombra, and...yes, Toreador.This comic would be a great introduction, not a clan oriented story.One more thing, in the world of darkness kindred can't drink anything but blood, it would require an unbeliveable skill ""masquerading"" that for the entire evening (and look she actually fills the glass).If you are a fanatic white wolf supporter, like me, buy it..."
3,Sitting Prone - could be a little taller,"This is a quality product and works well overall. I am only 5'8"" tall but this rest is a bit short I think. Hope you do not have to shoot upgrade very much because it makes you crouch to do so. Level shooting is OK for my height. If you are long in the torso I would consider the seated model perhaps and not extend all the way."
5,Great Christian Existentialist Read,"To my mind, this is one of the finest products of the Christian Existentialist school. Brilliant, poetic, insightful, profound. A moving meditation on the nature of poverty of Spirit. It has sustained me many nights through difficult times in post-disaster New Orleans. Highly Recommended."
3,"decent, but nothing new...","lawless element...I must say that babygrande has fallen off in the last couple years...in an attempt to get some jazzy stuff on the label as opposed to the homo-bashing done on jmt and outerspace releases, the lawless kids do come correct on the production end...lyrics are nothing short of standard hood rap which can be found on any mainstream release these days...honestly, the production at times can outweigh the pointless flows...dilla does one beat and madlib contributes a couple beats to clean out his hard drive...this cd is something you would have as background music, not as something you would have all ears on...all in all, the cd is a decent release...I payed 4 bucks for it used...if you find it for a reasonable price, grab it, because it isnt horrible, but it isnt going to be in heavy rotation either.Lyrics: C-Beats: B+Overall: C"
1,Get something else worth reading.,This book is basically pretty (bad). No other words to say it but it's(bad). The things described in this book I asure will not work. It shows pictures of a ninja getting passed a military guard over and over with different tactics which i believe is complete (nonsense) and if you try to sneak in any military camp with these skills you won't be alive very long. If you do happen to get by the guards like the ninja photographed in the book then the guard and his army are (not very competent) and most likely won't achieve what there trying to achieve. I must say that maybe there are ninja secrets of invisibility but you just won't find them in this book. If your into ninja i recommend reading books by Stephen K. Hayes and Masaaki Hatsumi.
4,"good, but memo button is really annoying","as a first time palm user, i'm very impressed with the palm v. however, the bottom right corner ""memo"" button will get pressed at the slightest inadvertant pressure, even if you buy the metal case. finally, i melted the corner of the metal case to fix this problem. but please beware of this little annoyance."
2,Not such a Hot PDA,"the Palm V is not all that 3COM made it out to be. the backliight is not so great, and when syncing the devicee with my PC , the PALM ran out of Space!!!"
1,do not recommend this company,"I do not recommend this company to buy a pda from. They have terrible customer service. I purchased a pda for my husband for Christmas and when he received it, it would not work and it would not sit in the charger, it had to be held in the holder. My husband called the company, but they would not help him. He shipped it back the same day he received it. Their return policy is within 72 hours and we sent it back within that time period and I also contacted them through email about wanting my money back and they did not send a response to my email and I have not received my money back for it either. I would never do business with this company again and would hope that no one else would either. I would not want anyone else to be cheated out of their money the way I was."
1,It's disapointing,"The Litium-ion batery failed from the start the only resource was to send back to factory they are very busy selling units do not help five weeks after, waiting yet!"
4,Need More Memory,"Immediately discovered the Palm V's memory is not sufficient tohotsynch the data I wanted to keep handy. Email alone used up so muchmemory (especially those with attachments that I can't open anyway); so I had to either be more conscientious in filing and deleting emails, or disengage the email hotsynch function. I disengaged.Found through various sources that there are several places to upgrade Palms; and one of the top-rated is palmpilotupgrade.com. Hallelujah! With the upgrade, my Palm V is virtually the equivalent of the Palm Vx.I've been using Microsoft Outlook for a long time, and it contains all kinds of important data. I didn't want to switch, so I was happy that Palm now accommodates Outlook. END"
2,The worst Ever Experiance with Palm,"Having comfortably used Palm3 , I thought i would go for Palm 5.In the first 90 days , Palm sent three units , which to my utter astonishment have got different kinds of problems . After one year of purchase of this Palm5 , I am using my old Palm3 . If you want to rely on Palm hand held , Don't go for Palm V."
4,Well written,Very sad story. Sue should be very proud of herself for coming through the other side with a good husband and children.
4,Good basic shock.,"Good product, fit well on my 87 Toyota Pickup. Installs in less than 30 minutes. Gives my truck a much stiffer ride. Eliminated a lot of ""creaks"" from the truck suspension. Seems to work just as well as those expensive shocks."
2,"One of the worst ""Dummies"" books I've ever seen",You better already know how to write your Resume because this won't help.
2,Boring...,"This book was a disappointment. In the beginning of the book, the author himself admitted that Murray's management would not cooperate in the writing of a biography. Thus he was left with reading various books and articles to do his research. Much of the book quoted a biography written by David Livingstone in 1981. It was like reading Livingstone's book twice! I have been an Anne Murray fan for 20 years and reading this biography left me knowing only as much as I did before. This publication is also full of misspelled words and misprints! An individual that doesn't know much about Murray may benefit from this book but die-hard fans need not bother."
4,It is a shop manual - what do you expect.,The bike is long gone. The book is still in use - friends have borrowed it many times over the years. The repairs get done. The steps are correct. The book has stayed together.
5,Profoundly moving and powerful,This book resonates with the power and beauty of spirit. The story is so strong and heartfelt about the entire unfolding of Jesus and the interactions among the others. I was so moved that often I had to stop reading and reflect before I could continue. The story makes sense and rings true to me. A must read. Powerfully told and beautifully written.
2,Expecting more,"I was somewhat disappointed by this book. I am very open to other possibilities, but this one did not follow up on the promise of the introduction."
5,Mikasa Palomino Plates Were Great!,These plates were bought at a outlet store that was closing and we needed more sets. I found them on Amazon and ordered them for a great price plus no shipping. They arrived quickly and without any problems!! I love them!
3,Was expecting better....,"Bought two packs (a total four batteries). Bought them for three M$ Laser 7000 wireless mice that have charging units. These are the exact specs of the batteries that came with the mice. Unfortunately, after a week, one of the three mice stopped charging and I got a red light almost immediately after starting to charge. Replaced the battery with the fourth battery and it charged just fine.Now a second battery within a month has started to do the same thing. I have found that if I turn off the mouse, unplug the battery and re-insert the battery with the mouse turned off, it might start charging it after five or six attempts.For the price I figured I was getting a quality product, apparently not. 50% failure rate within a month equals not good."
2,Not a Easy Read,"Although Lilli Lehmann speaks English in this book, she uses bloated, way over the top words to make a point. If I have to get a dictionary out to understand teh lessons then i am wasting my time. (Bear in mind I have the copy without a translastion).Because the book was hard to comprehend - my attention spand was cut short. I never made it past Chapter one.I did not like the book at all. A total WASTE of cash.I need a book that is straight forward so I can learn how to sing correctly, instead of elaborate verbal piece of NOTHING."
1,one touch purchase betrayed,"I wanted to read a credible conspiracy theory book on the Kennedy assassination and somehow settled on this work of garbage. It is so poorly written that it is little more than conspiracy theory-related words thrown together randomly that occasionally come together to form sentences.I have come to the conclusion that the term ""credible conspiracy theory book"" is an oxymoron.Don't waste your money."
1,I'me on my third replacement!,"Yes, every time the machine receives a fax the paper jams. When trying to copy a document the sheet goes in ok but the printing paper gets jammed. I've used several wieghts of paper but the same thing happens. In the UK I must be well known to Sharpserve as they continue to send replacemenrs for my 'faulty' machine but to no avail. I am waiting for this product to be upgraded so that the next replacement actually works. The staff of Sharpserve are very polite and friendly but I hope the designers get their acts together soon !"
1,Unrealiable,"When I first bought the fax machine I received alot of junk faxes. I haven't had a real problem sending a fax, but I have had problems receiving faxes. It appears to function but will give me an out of paper or paper jammed error. On the last one I checked the spool inside and it printed but the paper would not go through. I took out the paper and reinserted it, open up the machine to see if their was actually some paper that jammed and check to see if the spool was turning i gave up."
1,Help!!,Can't get the game on. It freezes the computer. It seems to start O.K.I see the introduction clips and it looks great then I get to load a game and the computer freezes. A blue screan appears.
1,"not happy, because we can't play","Looks like a great program! But we have not been able to play it, due to the fact, we need more graphic memory. We met the minium requirements, but according the company; which I called, we need to have another graphics card put in the computer. The graphics memory minium should be a 128 or 256, not 64 as listed. So unless you have that much graphic memory, and/or are prepared to purchase for your computer, forget it. For the price of a $20.00 game, I have to spend another $100-200 to put more graphic memory in my computer. So until I can pay that, we cannot play the game."
4,Super B-Boy FUNKIN!!,"Despite the highly simplistic and overtly sexual lyrics on some of these tracks, this album rests on it's smooth beats and unique rhymes. The pace is a throwback to old-school, the lyrics are Eminem-esque, and the beats are fresh and funky. Can't help but nod your head to this."
5,Great John Wayne Movies,"Two movies for the price of one, even though John Wayne dies at the end of both movies. The ending is still good."
5,A VERY TALENTED ARTIST,"This is one of my favorite smooth jazz guitar artist. Joe's playing style is unlike any other smooth jazz guitar artist. Norman Brown, Chuck Loeb, and Peter White, are all seasoned playing artist. Joe simply adds a new listening pleasure to smooth jazz guitar."
4,Great Water Purification System for Travel,I am planning to visit SE Asia & bought this for a 2 month trip. I tested it on a week trip & it passed with flying colors.
2,Can't be trusted in the backcountry,"I would love to be able to recommend the steripen because when it works, it works great. What I can't figure out is why it works perfectly at home, but is very sporadic on the trail. On a recent weeklong backpacking trip in Utah three of us had these along and all experienced the same problem. It would only work correctly about 25% of the time - meaning that the light would successfully stay on for the required amount of time. The other 75% of the time we would all get the red failure light. I can assure you this was not operator error. It would often take three or four tries of having the light on in order to get it to work. Other times it would go straight to error and we had to give up.If you disregard this review and take it into the backcountry I strongly suggest that you bring either chlorine or iodine tablets as a back-up."
1,Completely Unreliable,"I brought my SteriPEN into the Himalayas during a month-long trek. It failed, for no reason, on the fourth day of my ever using it and never worked again. I tried new batteries, drying it, I tried it over and over. I found this product to be completely unreliable and quick to fail. I have since spoken with other trekkers in Nepal who had the same experience with it. The product is a good idea but should be taken off the market until a more reliable product can be produced. It is a waste of money."
3,Interesting but glossy,"After hearing the author on npr I was eager to purchase and read this book. The book is well researched and it is overflowing with gossip about those artists with whom absinthe has been so intertwined--Proust, Gaugin, et al. The author contends that the drink had little or no real impact on the creative abilities of the writers and painters of the 19th century who claimed that the Green Fairy was their great muse. The argument falls flat, however. Whether the drink spurred the creativity or not is not as clear as the belief of the artists that it did have a very powerful and empowering influence. It is all very ""chicken or the egg"" speculation but in the end, this book is a fun read if you want a little dish on the life and times of these absinthe influenced artists."
4,Cute,"Very cute, shipped very quickly. Exactly how it was pictured. Little did I know, I would be allergic to the charm. Oh well, it looks cute in my jewelry box"
4,Handle,"I like the sweeper, but I have had to tape the handle to keep it from coming apart. I can't seem to get a good fit for the connection. Otherwise, I'm happy with the product."
3,The Handle Needs Improvement,"The handle comes apart way, way too easily. I'm going to remedy that next time I use it.It seems to pick up little crumbs and hair just fine. Some of the bigger crumbs jump around for awhile before I can get the sweeper to pick them up, but it's no biggie. This thing isn't meant to be a vaccuum."
1,Over Priced Plastic,Mine broke 3 inches from the base after one week of barely holding up stuffed animals. Not sturdy at all even when a quarter of the animals were beenie babies.
3,Weird. Really weird.,"The old Simple Minds had a really weird way about them. Their lyrics are impenetrable, which I guess is fine since you can't understand what he's saying anyway. Then there's noises. Lots of noises-something that sounds like a buzzsaw every four beats during the verses of ""70 Cities as Love Brings the Fall"" (what a title) and a klinking bass note repeated in ""Seeing Out The Angel"". It's almost industrial.Simple Minds were not simple minds; they're probably even more ambitious than U2 or Hothouse Flowers or any other British band seeking a higher power thru rock music. I can only imagine what Johnny & The Self-Abusers sounded like."
2,Cut outs for the 3rd row would be nice,It fits nice but I am disappointed in the difficulty in cutting out the slots for the 3rd row seats.
3,Get Vol. 1 first!,"This is Collectables' second volume of Lightnin' Hopkins' Herald material, which showcases the great Texas bluesman cranking it up a bit more than usual. But get Vol. 1 first: the material is better; Vol. 2 features two vocals by the mediocre singer Ruth Ames, backed by Hopkins; and, in a shamefully audacious move, Vol. 2 puts five identical songs from Vol. 1 on this disc, four under different titles! ""Shine on Moon"" is listed as such on both discs, while ""Lightnin's Boogie"" from Vol. 1 is reproduced as ""Boogie Woogie Dance,"" ""Hear Me Talkin'"" as ""Early Morning Boogie"", ""Flash Lightnin'"" as ""Lightnin's Special"", and ""Lightnin's Stomp"" as ""Grandma's Boogie"". This takes the shine off what is otherwise a pretty good album."
3,A slice of our own family history,"At Uncle Manny's 75th birthday celebration, we gathered the family around to watch this documentary program. It was fun to learn more about my husband's Italian heritage. And even more fun to watch his family pick out their relatives and friends.The program did a good job of presenting community history on a personal level. And it made clear how easy it is to lose one's heritage. But if it weren't for the personal link to the subject matter, I don't think the program would have been half as interesting. I suppose that's true of all nostalgic pieces."
2,she loves it.......but it's not that great,"My two-year-old daughter got this as a gift and she loves it-but she gets very upset when the basket keeps falling off, which happens alot when she turns corners quickly or stops suddenly. The cardboard boxes are already in the trash. She likes to try to ""feed"" the baby but gets frustrated when she wants to remove the doll and she can't get it out. I am thinking I might go buy her a different one as this one has so many problems it doesn't seem worth it."
3,Not the best thought out toy...,"My daughter got this at 19mo as a Christmas present. The boxes were flimsy, had lousy graphics and only lasted about a week. It would have been nice if they clearly identified what they were supposed to be, with bold letters, (like CEREAL) so you could use them as a learning aid. I agree with other reviews about the basket and seat coming off way too easily. Great concept but poor execution. The coolest things were the milk carton and the banana. I'll probably donate this to good will and get one of the sturdy realistic styles and get more play food."
1,"good translation, missed the point","Feuerstein offers a solid translation and interpretation, except that he misses the point of the central teaching of Patanjali: yogascittavrttinirodha. He takes it to mean that yoga aims at the dissolution of life and the human being. This is not true. As Ian Whicher expounds in his ""The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana"" (SUNY), cittavrttinirodha can be taken to mean the cessation of misidentification with modifications of the mind, not the total cessation of the modifications of the mind. This renders Yoga a life-affirming and positive philosophy and practice as opposed to Feuerstein's thesis that it is inherently aimed at the destruction of the whole human being who practises it. The translation in this book is still great, but for explanation of the meaning, look somewhere else, e.g. Whicher's ""The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana""."
1,disappointing,i was very excited to see i finally got in in the the mall 2 weeks LATE...and that's not all it only came with the dvd not the pillow case or the other cool stuff it said i would get.
5,"Best way to experience Haruhi, A Must-Buy","Much superior to any of the other Haruhi collections/versions available overseas, unless price is an issue.Get this whole LE set!"
2,The PAST as judged by the PRESENT,"The film takes the anti-Mormon historical accounts of the event as fact. Again, modern Americans use a cinematic event to judge and condemn people of former times with current attitudes. This gives modern Americans the opportunity to feel righteous indignation against other people. YES the event did happen. Did Brigham Young order it or did John D. Lee commit the massacre on his own? Since we can only read what is written by observers of the times we will never know. This will not stop modern bigots who were not there in 1857 from using this film to condemn the Mormon Church of today. Anything to be offended. It provides these hypocrites the same self-satisfaction that Krystalnacht provided the Nazis."
2,A hate Mormons movie,"It isn't a well kept secret that people have triedto put an end to the Mormon religion, or that the Mormon's have fought for their rights and mostly lost.Many times religions have called themselves 'God's People'.In this case killing the stranger within your bordersis strictly forbidden by old testament scripture,but it hasn't stopped either 'Christian' side (Indian massacres)This is love story of star crossed lovers and a black horsewhen death and destruction are gathered all around.The Piautes and Mormons together...Do you really think a God of love has sympathy for either side?"
4,What in the name of God???,"The thing that really got to me about this movie, is when they would flip from one scene to another when both groups were involved in ""prayer."" The mormon's way of praying about floored me. Their prayers were so evil, spiteful and full of revenge..and for their leader to say that ""God"" told him what had to be done.....what kind of God do they pray to?This movie was good for my daughter. I have always tried to warn her about some of the evils of the world, and this just chalked up some points on why you don't join a cult."
4,good trainning goods,"I learned much items with this goods.If got with more low price,I hope to recommend to my friends.Thank you."
4,Good workout and useful for balancing,"The day after buying the Bosu and using once, it lost a lot of air. Re-inflated but still lost about an inch of height a day.The replacement unit retains air much better. Upgraded my initial evaluation of 1 star to 4.It's interesting that the Bosu manual says it's not for commercial use."
1,Definitely: Buyer Beware!!!!,"I just purchased the Bosu home version and carefully followed instructions and started the workout. After about an hour, the inflated half ball came out of the plastic rim, and as another reviewer stated there is no way this is going to go back in securely - even if the ball was deflated and the rim was taken apart. There is a horrible smelly chemical residue on the rim and it seems that it wasn't glued correctly or perhaps the inflatable plastic part isn't made correctly. It looks uneven and lopsided around the edges which explains why it popped from the rim. What an expensive disappointment!!!! That said, the workout was really enjoyable and I could definitely see how it would be fun + beneficial. The quality of the product, however, is horrendous."
3,Wanted to like this more,"I got this because the price was right and I wanted to check out 17 Hippies better. They get no airplay here in Seattle that I know of and I like finding new music. That said, there wasn't as much Balkan influence on this recording as I was hoping for, and after several initial listenings I have not pulled it out much since then. So-so. Might not be the best album by 17 Hippies. I would very much like to hear more of their music though."
1,What a cheaply designed bike!,"I ordered this bike thinking it's a Schwinn, it's got to be a decent bike. When it arrived, I assembled what was not already done-not a big deal, but the brakes where impossible to adjust. I wanted to take it for a test drive to find myself come to a complete halt. Literally, the first 3 seconds of taking off, the whole gear shifter broke and went into the spokes in the tire and the chain was hanging there. If you want a cheap bike that's going to break literally before you get to ride, buy this one."
1,Thoughtless,"I'm from the East Coast, and know nothing about life in Highland Park, Texas. But after reading the first few pages of this book, I thought, ""This is an avalanche of stereotypes. This is obviously an East or West Coast person's idea of what 'those backward Texans' are like."" I checked the book jacket, and sure enough the author was from the East Coast. I was not at all surprised to find user reviews from real Texans who objected to the book. The character of Myrna is so stupid that she is totally unbelievable. We are supposed to be reading Myrna's inner thoughts, but what we get is actually the excuses that she might tell someone else to explain her behavior. It doesn't really get to the heart of what a ""follower"" type feels on the inside."
4,Happy with this purchase,"I did a lot of shopping around before purchasing these chairs and I am confident I gottten one of the best deals on teak furniture out there. The wood is beautiful, no nicks or marks anywhere. I did have a little problem putting the chair bottom together. I needed an electric drill as I could not use sweat equity to screw it in. Other than that, the chairs are very easy to put together, even for the hardware challenged (had no mallot so I had to improvise).I only gave it four stars because, as noted by other reviewers, this chair sits very straight. A slight arch in the design would have been benefitical. They chair is also very wide so no one should complain about being squeezed in. It will be interesting as I shop for cushions to fit this chair. I might be forced to by direct from the manufacturer. Overall, I am happy with the chairs and anxiously await my table."
4,You can read this book from any page,"I would definitely say that my life would be less if I hadn't read this book. Having said that, there are some things that disappoint. First, this is a collection of thoughts; it is not a story, or a novel. I had half-expected a philosophical novel on the lines of Sartre or Camus; this is definitely not one of those. The writer has an interesting grasp of language; yet, his novel meanders and tends to repeat. It is also a little self-obsessed; the narrative vaccilating between self-praise, self-deprecation, maudlin self-pity and some lyrical descriptions of nature.At the end of this book, it is a little hard for me to know much about the author; his thoughts as expressed are sometimes a little too well polished and at others, a little too rambling. His philosophy is somewhat incoherent, other than the over-arching nihilism. However, little gems of description shine through at various points and some interesting turns of phrase enliven the gloom"
5,"Breathtaking, beautiful","I have read hundreds of Christian fiction books and hundreds of books in general and, while the quality of all can be appreciated, only a few writers have made as grand an impression as Hickman has with Katrina's Wings, those few being counted among classics such as Fitzgerald and Hemingway. In this book you will find more than just a warm story full of real-life struggles, heartache, and smiles (which is all included)-- breathtaking, lyrical prose and charming language tells you this is a writer with a great gift. Her images and dialogue linger in your mind long after they have passed and it is impossible not to be captivated by this book. Read it--it's worth it!"
4,Small but helpful,"this item is not as large as i thought it would be, since the title includes the word large - that is a relative term. we have deep larger drawers, and this didnt help much at all. i have some smaller top drawers, so now i use this to organize jewelry, scarves, brushes and small items."
1,Run From This Steaming Pile Of You Know What,"Software that runs this printer makes MSDOS look like Apple Snow Leopard. I'm presently trying to print one lousy paragraph from Text Edit. The printer has a 10 minute Hissy Fit Light Show, spits out 20 sheets of blank paper, then jams halfway through the paragraph.An absolutely Epic Failure of a machine."
1,Very Tempermental. Does not print all documents.,"Inability to print most documents. It will print most text documents, but the moment that I try to send a picture or anything of any file size, it blinks at me for a while and then just goes back to normal. Never spits out my job. I have spent countless hours on the phone with HP over in some other country that does not speak English too well. I have reinstalled the drivers I don't know how many times. Everytime I would call back, a different person would make me reinstall the drivers. Then one of their guys told me that it was a problem with MS Excel. That was the last straw. I knew it was hopeless to go any farther. So I have learned my lesson. Please Beware! Until better drivers are released, this printer is not suitable for what it is built to do."
5,Jackie Robinson: A Biography,"I learned from this book that Jackie Robinson was not the first African American who was told to move from the front of the bus in the south. I knew it was not Rosa Parks. The title was given to her because she was in Montgomery with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr when the movement was at it's height"
2,disappointed,"Recently I attended a conference in California where smoked salmon was served as part of the breakfast buffet. It was heavenly, and I decided to incorporate it as part of my breakfast routine. I bought a fillet at my local grocery chain and enjoyed it greatly, but looked on Amazon for a more cost-effective approach. This salmon is from a reputable company, but I have to say I really don't like it, compared both to the smoked salmon I had in California and from my local grocery. It comes in a broth, and at first feels a little soft when I open the pack, but then when I eat it without the brine, it is actually quite dry. The smoked flavor is even a little too light for my taste. Truly, I have never cared for sockeye; I've always found it dry even when not smoked, and I pay the extra for king when buying my fresh salmon. I notice other reviewers put this salmon in dips and chowders; I think that is a good solution, but I will cancel my subscription and buy smoked salmon locally for now."
4,fiesta vase,the vase matches the fiesta in style and color. holds a few flowers. looks great on a small table. i recommend if you want a small vase to match your place settings.
1,Junk!,The average selling 20 dollar boombox could out performe this hunk of junk. My little Bose Wave radio has a much better sound than this and a much more power than this. Don't buy it!
5,Exactly what I needed,"I bought this to fit my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150, bought in the same transaction, and it fits the camera just fine. It's high quality, has a couple pockets, and isn't too bulky. A great camera case."
1,FLIMSY!!,"We bought this swing for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She lifted it up to carry it into the living room and the legs came off...It seems like they are ALWAYS coming off. PLUS, the weight of the doll makes the swing bend in some...Had I known when I bought it that it was like this, I would not have wasted my money. The stroller is so sturdy that I thought the swing would be as well. My mistake."
1,Very fragile,Dissapointed with this product! Our daughter can not even play with it without it falling apart! Small pieces that disconnect from swing not a good idea for childrens toys!
2,O.K.,I think this product would work O.K. for someone who doesn't have really bony toes but it didn't help after about an hour when I tried them.
5,Very comfortable,Very comfortable and large enough for my big toe. Keeps me from pushing toe through the top of my shoes.
3,Seems to work but the bleach effect is too much,"I hadn't really thought of benzoyl peroxide-ing in the shower until I had a resurgence of pimples (hormones, anyone?) and couldn't go back to the benzoyl-peroxide-all-day-smell-and-bleach-effect on my clothes.So, despite washing carefully with soap after using this, now it's bleach all over the towels. That left me having to use all the ratty old towels (aka the dog towels) while hubby had the nice towels. Not so nice.I've given up on this and now just use exfoliating gloves and am just really careful to wash/cleanse twice a day and/or immediately after exercise, etc."
2,To much for shipping,"Looks like a good product, but you can get the same thing at walmart and not have to $40.00 in shipping. Boo"
5,High quality,"These knobs look like you could have bought them for a LOT more money. I was looking at similar knobs that cost twice or three times as much. I bought this to update a vanity mirror drawer, and it really made the desk pop. These can be used to inexpensively revamp furniture. I'm very pleased."
5,This album was too good for its own good,"It wasn't long after this fine album was released, when Simple Minds found fame and fortune with 'Don't You Forget About Me,' featured in 'The Breakfast Club' soundtrack.It's truly sad that the soundtrack tune they didn't write is the song that Simple Minds is best remembered by, when you've got songs like 'Waterfront' and 'Speed Your Love To Me' in your catalog.Worth the price of admission here, people, while supplies last...it is a Limited Edition, after all. Don't wait too long!"
4,Honest and Surprising,"Enjoyable stories. They seem simple to some degree, but that's misleading. They're actually very thoughtful character studies. There's one about an old couple that just about had me in tears. I'm not even sure exactly why, but the author clearly touched on something about enduring love and the fear of being alone that sent shivers through me. If you like honest writing without the pretension of literary fiction but with the kind of wisdom all writers aspire to then check out this collection."
1,Good story- not believable,"I own an adult night club, or Strip bar as some people call it. I found this book lying around and read it. It was ridiculous!!!! The story of Heidi's life is far too common( A nice girl struggling to get herself through college), YEAH RIGHT!! Haven't these girls ever heard of scholarships?. girls strip at my club and other clubs for EASY and FAST money. Men pay good money for these girls to take it off. The night club industry is not at all like the book describes, there's drugs, affairs and alcohol everywhere."
1,I did not like this bracket,"When I was looking for a window mount for my Starmate5 radio, I considered this mount but decided to go with a different one, which I later found out had been discontinued. I received this mount as a comparable substitute for the one I ordered (it's not). The suction cup works well and does an excellent job of adhering the mount to the window. Unfortunately, there is no way to lock down the AMPS end of this mount. While it will hold the radio in position as long as there are no bumps or vibrations, as soon as you encounter any, the radio position will change. I've had this for less than a week and I will be returning it. I don't know how anyone could be happy with this mount. Other than price, there's really no reason to purchase it. You get what you pay for and for just a few dollars more; you can get a much better mount.I would not recommend this mount to anyone."
5,Works like a charm!,"I've used a number of window mounts for various accessories and this one is as good as I've found. Secure mount, easy to adjust and hasn't come loose yet!"
2,Doesn't Fit,Maybe I read the description incorrectly but this mount doesn't fit my Wife's Sirius radio. It seems well made it just doesn't fit.
5,Sirius Window Mount bracket Model 14101,Bracket is easy to mount and does the job. Just make sure your windshield has a clean surface otherwise it might not stay on very long. Hope this helps anyone decide as I do recommend.
5,Micheal W Smith Change World Concert,I really liked Michael's concert it was great. You could feel the presence of Jesus in the audience. Love all of his songs. The songs made feel like I was right there. Michael keep up the good work.And you have a great looking family. Which are now older of course. God Bless You. Thank you Amazon.com for such a fast delivery.
2,Get the Organizing Sourcebook instead,"Seduced by the attractive cover and positive reviews, I bought this book. Don't fall into the same trap! The intro chapter was somewhat useful, but the rest of it was thin and seemed like nothing more than a compendium of tips compiled from the likes of Real Simple. At the same time I purchased this, I also bought The Organizing Sourcebook, which I recommend without hestitation."
5,"Good action scenes, great Zheng Liu, plot too complicated","I just saw the movie, and I have to say that I was impressed by most of the action scenes, as they look very real, and there is a lot of action on this movie.The main actor Zheng Liu, first time I ever see him, looks impressive on the fighting scenes and for sure, is not the next Bruce Lee as the people says cause Bruce is only one, but has a lot o potencial to be an upcoming Kung-Fu star. Definitely I'm hoping to see more of him in the near future.Also I found the plot of the movie too complicated and too many twists for an action-fighting film, wich has made me confused sometimes.About acting.. nothing impresive but nothing wrong... still fun and worthed to watch, recommended for seat on the couch and enjoy some fresh good action."
1,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED,THIS DIDN'T EVEN HOLD UP TO THE TRAILER.tHE TRAILER HAD TO HAVE BEEN TAKE FROM ANOTHER MOVIE BECAUSE I NEVER SAW THAT SCENE. PLEASE PAST THIS VIDEO BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR TIME MUCH LESS YOUR MONEY.
1,Manual of IV Therapeutics,"The edition for the book was not listed and I needed the 4th edition and got the 3rd edition. I think it should be required for people who are selling books, especially ones used for school, to list which edition it is."
2,a siren in the dark,the cover on the dvd look great but the movie is bad. i enjoyed the men but that was it. only if you have nothing else to watch than choose this one
3,"Low budget, softcore gay supernatural horror","This is definitely not my type of film, but it still showed a lot of promise. A psychic detective is tracks down a murderer, discovering debauchery and drug use in a rural area. Being a heterosexual male, he seems to be the only one not getting laid in this movie. There's a lot of softcore, male-on-male sex going on. Full frontal male nudity, but only topless women. The murders are all in the vein of low-budget, low-gore ""knife across the throat"" style. This is strictly an independent (shoestring budget) film with corny acting, cheesy lines and just a few sets. The plot is actually pretty interesting, though, especially for such a low-budget flick, and the directors do some interesting things with the budget they've got. Considering the supernatural elements, they're probably the most natural-seeming elements of the movie."
2,"This ""Siren"" is a true alarm.","This convoluted mess that mixes soft core porn with a lame story is simply a laugh. A missing persons investigation turns into a romp in the woods with a dark haired ""siren"". Eating at the local diner proves to be a mistake for any gay man who dares to take the ""short cut"" back road. With a revolving door of actors there are no real believable characters here and the strained dialogue quickly leads to gratuitous sex and drugs. If this movie were a touch more campy it could have been pulled off as a comedy!"
2,Low Quality,"I started this movie and watched about 15 minutes before deciding that it wasn't going to get any better, and stopped it."
1,Absolutely vile scent,"I have two indoor cats who eat a low-residue diet and I scoop the litter daily, so there's never much waste in the cat box to begin with. I agree with others who say that it is great at deodorizing litter box odors; I haven't smelled cat waste since I started using this. However, I won't be purchasing the product again because the deodorant in the litter smells absolutely disgusting. The best way I can describe it is overripe or rotting fruit; to me there is nothing ""fresh"" or natural in the odor - just a cloying, overly sweet chemical smell (kind of like when oranges go moldy). Not only is the scent very bad it is also very strong. I keep the litter box in the downstairs bathroom and I can smell the litter throughout the entire house. I just poured the last of the litter into the cat box tonight and am looking forward to buying my regular litter again this weekend; it doesn't contol cat waste odors as well, but frankly, cat waste smells less offensive than this stuff."
4,A Satisfying Read,"In this latest outing of the likable, wise-cracking Boston gumshoe, we find him being gently persuaded to delve into the case of a boy who stands accused of a horrible crime. To the delight of many Spenser fans, Susan's presence is minimal throughout the tale, but to the dismay of those very same fans, Hawk is nowhere to be found (though there is a brief reference to Hawk by Spenser when he seeks to enlist the aid of a local hood).In spite of the lingering presence of Susan throughout (she's attending a professional conference out of state while the gumshoe is on the case), I found myself laughing at key points in the tale. I enjoyed reading Parker's clipped, sharp 'prose'. He certainly has nailed the dialog thing.In fact, I think I will pick up the next tale in the Spenser series and give it a slow, careful read. I am amazed at all the life lessons Parker drops here and there. Every book he writes is a true intellectual treat."
2,Not One of His Best,"I really enjoy Spenser and the Spenser cast of characters. I didn't care for this one, though. Really predictable and not very exciting.Spenser features Pearl way too much. The ending was weak. I'd recommend many other Parker books, but not this one."
4,Spenser sans Susan,"This was one of the few Spenser mysteries where I could actually understand who the bad guys were and how Spenser dealt with them. Usually, the endings are so convoluted that I don't really know what went on. This was very fast paced and I read the whole thing in one night. I too didn't miss Susan or Hawk. I also enjoyed the presence of Pearl, even though she is a silly dog afraid of the rain."
2,"""One"" Dimensional","My primary question after reading this book is ""What was Parker Thinking?"" In my opinion to write a Spenser book without Hawke or Susan is a waste of time for the author in writing it and a waste of time for the reader in reading it.The only reason I even finished School Days is that I was hoping Hawke would appear somewhere - I was doomed to disappointment - (and also I have a thing about finishing every book I start no matter what).At least some excuse was given for Susan's absence - Hawke however was barely mentioned.Unfortunately - no pun intended - Spenser alone is completely ""One Dimensional"".RWNew York"
4,That's more like it.,"I love Roxy Music,but I can't get any new Roxy Music.I love Bryan Ferry,but not as much as Roxy Music.I know,,,,Bryan Ferry was Roxy Music,but with a lot of input of Manzanera,Mackay andThompson ohh yeah and Eno.Frantic is the closest to a Roxy Musiccd I can get,bless you Bryan.This album could be a Country Life,which I happen to like a lot.There is 2 songs here that don't quite cut it, but hey.Hmmmmmm time to push repeat."
2,Did Bryan lose a lung somewhere along the line?,"-sure sounds so...and there he is posed smoking in most of the MANY booklet pictures of his airbrushed, hairdyed visage...We sold the cd back after a day or 2 of trying.Ah well, old heroes... go to ROXY albums 1-2-3, orBF solo 1-2-3 for some great work...Vive obscurity/dying young!!"
5,I love it!,"My aunt gave me a jar of this to try. I love it! It isn't greasy, yet it seems to be healing on my very itchy skin. My skin is always so soft after using it, so I keep a jar for my body and a tube in my purse for my hands. So glad I was able to find it on Amazon!"
5,Spicey and Hot,"Some of my favorite themed literature and art come from the late 1800's. This is a spicey, (almost indecent - that's subjective) novel set around a vaudeville act and an oyster shucker. Read the book and have seen the movie, several times. Sarah Waters writing style is impeccable, IMO."
1,This is the worst book I have read in ages!,"I was really looking forward to this after reading the fine reviews this book has received from other readers. Unfortunately, this book has turned out to be the worst I have come across in a long time, and was extremely hard to finish. I had no sympathy for the main character, found her attitude towards other people callous and selfish, and did not care what happened to her next. I also found her ""renting"" period ridiculous and quite out of character for someone so resolutely butch. Give me a writer like Jeanette Winterson any day, at least the people in her books seem human! Don't bother."
1,be careful,"this is not the original oi the dvd (or movie). some of the tracklistings are different, and some of the best bands and songs are not here."
5,Delightful,"As an adult male, I don't often read books about teenages. When it was suggested I read Stone Garden, I began the ""task"" with some treperdation. My fears were unfounded. Stone Garden is delightful! All the characters, with one exception, were real and easy to care about -- even Matthew who never appears on the pages of the book. (Quite a feat.) The plot moves right along and I DID want to know what happens.When a writer holds your attention with the characters, and keeps you turning the page, I say, ""Thank you."" I've recommemded to several friends and family, young and old."
3,"Enjoyable - not a great book, but a good story","Ms Moynahan's novel made me laugh, cry, and remember my own first teenage love. As other reviews have alluded, the story is a bit fantastic, with unrealistic twists and turns. But it's a novel, a story, and authors are allowed to play around with reality. Do her characters have depth? Yes. Does she describe her locales well enough that I get a sense of place? Yes. Does the plot keep me intrigued and reading? Yes. Is her prose occasionally melodramatic and at times over-the-top? Yes, but so is life.I laughed as she described the cliques and the classrooms. I wondered at how nonchalant her characters feel towards sex. But I enjoyed her book for what it is, a good story. I was taken away from my daily routine into a world different from my own, and glad for the minivacation.Is it great literature? No. Did it make me feel something? Yes. So, I recommend it as good girly fluff to wallow in on a cold winter afternoon."
3,"Excellent pictures, but reliability may be a problem","The camera takes excellent pictures in just about all conditions, and the autofocus is very reliable; it rarely gets fooled by complicated situations. Flash pictures turn out quite well, with good even lighting throughout the picture. Reliablity has been a question, as the camera sometimes gets fussy and won't function correctly. Removing the battery and cleaning the contacts usually fixes the problem, but I have not had to do that before with a camera, and it is too frequent an occurrence with this one. In these cases of malfunction, the battery tests out fine so it is not the problem.If reliability were better this would be a five star camera."
4,Must Apply Oneself.,This is a book where one must underline or take notes -- to be approached in a scholarly way. It's not light reading.
3,Good and sad,I like it... the actresses were beautiful and the person who played Sara did a fantastic job - both actresses did really... I do want to say though that if you're looking for a happy ending this is not the film for it.
3,Strange,"Not sure about this movie. I found it dark and depressing. Artful, probably, but I had trouble getting beyond the cruelty of the father. The few shared moments of joy were not enough to overcome the darkness for me."
3,Don't use on DVDs,"These labels are great for CDs, but don't use on DVDs. I collect old LP vinyl records and transcript them to CDs for my personal use. The labels are easy to apply. I used the labels on my personal travel DVDs made from videos and that made the DVDs unplayable. If you look on the package, you will see in fine print ""Not recommended for DVDs"". I wasted lots of labels and DVDs before discovering this. I was able to remove the labels by soaking the DVDs in hot water, scraping, and then using mineral spirits to remove the glue. Takes lots of time and patience. I repeat: Don't use on DVDs! Memorex should remove ""DVD"" from its product label."
1,Don't buy unless you plan on buying a new printer afterwards,"I got these and was first disappointed to find that you need to purchase an applicator seperately.I was planning on buying a new printer some time soon. But this product kind of pushed me to get one faster than my wallet wanted me to. THEY GOT stuck in my printer. I could not get it out, I couldn't use my printer AT ALL afterwards! Totally jammed the printer. I actually had to purchase a new printer after using these labels. I was not happy."
3,Sometimes you need quality,"I've used the memorex and the Neato cd labels. They both serve their purpose, but if you want good quality designs and graphics, Neato is better. Memorex labels are thin, and will tear more often if you print alot of color. It also takes a couple minutes to dry. If you're using small amounts of color and have a steady hand...you might want the cheaper one."
4,Tattoos & Street Gangs,"The quality of the information on current tattoos was excellent, and worth the investment. You can't tell the street gang players without knowing their tattoos; this book will give you what you need to not only get started...it will become a 'go to' book in your library."
3,Canon WP1 vs Canon SureShot A1,"I had WP1 and A1 before. Both of them looked almost the same except the colour of the rubber grip for the hand is different, the macro logo of the mode dial is different. WP1 is a weatherproof camera, not waterproof. It is excellent for snorkelling and rugged use. WP1 started to leak at 6m or 20ft when I used for SCUBA diving, that was my mistake. So I bought an A1, so far tested to 35m (though only guaranteed to a few metres) and still going strong, same for another 2 A1s that my friends have. Both WP1 and A1 are excellent cameras, gave excellent pictures. The price difference (almost 100%) basically gives you the peace of mind in terms of water-tightness. One thing to take note, the flash is not strong enough so underwater pictures will turn out to be greenish or bluish, and fine particles will tend to disperse the flash and over expose the pictures. Have fun!"
1,Beware - read this before you buy,"I gave this 1 star because it is the exact same gig as the ""Live in Freiburg"" DVD. So don't buy both. It's a great DVD, but not worth screwing me over when I buy both (how can I return it? It's open). I think the post-production quality on the ""Live In Freiburg"" version is superior, so buy that one."
4,"Balanced, focused on digital still UW photography","I have read this book cover to cover and consider myself an intermediate level photographer, learning to apply principles to UW. Nice comparisons of same object and how different techniques such as depth of field or position of primary and fill strobes change appearance. I found the advice very practical and understandable when contemplating the composition of the different types of shots."
2,Disappointed,"Not in the story just the way it was written. I'm against any kind of child abuse & although it's very sad what happened to Julie, and you get some insight into what she went through, you don't really get involved in the story. Perhaps I was expecting more, having just read a superbly written book (Out of the Dark by LC & RR), but I think Julie should seriously consider changing editors. Good story - bad writing."
2,interesting story not so interestingly written,"While the story Julie Gregory tells is certainly interesting, she could have used the help of a strong editor to improve her writing. Her shifting verb tenses and clichéd healing terminology only weaken the impact of her tale. Should this kind of book, written to help others and to attain some kind of catharsis for its author, be judged on its literary merit? Maybe not as the sole criteria, but I found myself distracted by poor writing. This book could have benefited from a more straightforward storytelling approach."
4,Great Headphones with one flaw,"These headphones are really good but they are a little too small. If you have big ears, then think about getting a different one."
3,Disappointed,"I found noise cancelation to be acceptable. The problem I had was with the plug and plane adapter. The plug fit sloppily into the adapter. Sound continuously swithed from left to right and then off. I tried it on the two seats next to me with the same results. I then tried it on a fellow passenger's CD player and it cut out occasionally. He had a Bose unit which, of course, was quieter. His set worked fine in all three seat positions. Unfortunately, I bought 2 as gifts and could not take the chance they would not work properly. The recipients may not fly for months, making returning the sets immpossible. It was the adapter, not the headsets that made me lose confidence in this product."
4,Good for the price,"These are decent noise-cancelling head phones. The sound quality of the speakers is good but not great and as with all noise-cancelling head phones, they work better on low frequency sound than high. I purchased them because there is construction outside my office and they work. They all but eliminate the sounds of trucks idling outside my window; the annoying beeping and honking sounds are still perceptible but tolerable, Yet, with music playing at a low (ie. non-damaging) volume I don't notice the sounds."
1,Flimsy Friable Design,My headphones worked well for about 1 month and then they came off the plastic hinges where they attach to the earmuff. There is a screw that supposedly keeps it in place but it is so flimsy that this broke within 1 month of use. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM
2,Okay noise canceling but very uncomfortable headphones,"I was excited at first at how well these headphones did at noise canceling. The hums of everyday life disappeared. The noises on the train were mostly gone although not quite as gone as I had hoped. Still, pretty nice.I like how they fold up. I like how the cord feeds back in automatically. And the sound quality is fine.The problem with these headphones is that unless you have very small ears the ear pads will press uncomfortably on your ears instead of surrounding them. My ears always hurt once I take these off. It's probably worse if you have glasses. I've never had this problem with any other pair of headphones.If you're interested in these headphones try them on for 10 minutes before you buy them."
1,Don't bother,"I purchased these based on other favorable reviews, but based on the pair that I received they are barely worthy of 1 star. The noise canceling electronics are nearly useless, compared to, for example, the Audio Technica ATH-ANC7 headset. There is little discernible reduction in ambient noise with the electronics switched on vs off. The electronics also adds quite a bit of hiss to the background. The yoke that spans the top of your head is uniquely uncomfortable. To round out the deal, the cord retracts into the left earpiece. While a nice idea, I've already had to disassemble this earpiece twice to untangle the mechanism. Buy something else. Spend the money for the Audio Technica ATH-ANC7 or a nice pair of over the ear headphones that have good sound quality and are comfortable."
2,noise cancelling headphones,I have used these headphones on four different flights. They do not provide the noise cancelling quality as advertised. I have an older set that actually works much better. I purchased these from Amazon because they were rated as very high quality. That is not the case. They are well designed but poorly operating as stated.
3,Nice - but...,"I like the system, it's a perfect size and it's appearance isn't blocky or tacky like most systems. However, I'd have to say I've heard better - the speakers are okay, mine has already had to go in for service (the speakers were buzzing when I got it) and the LCD well, isn't consistent.If you're looking for style and something for your office - this is great - though I'm not sure it's the best value out there. For home, I don't think I'd get it."
2,Fisher disappointment,"after recieving the Fisher SLIM-1500 the first thing I noticed was how ""plasticy"" the product is ,overall the system seems to be very weakly made , and I'm worried the if I turn the volume dial too fast it may in fact just come loose. If your looking for decent quality sound steer clear of this system , as the audio quality is something to be desired , even taking into consideration the slim design I'm sure it can definatly be improved apon."
5,Great Sound Don't Listen to the bad comments it Works!,"I recently bought a Slim 1500 and it was great. The Sound worked and everything. I looked at some of the other reviews and they said it has bad sound. IT DOESN""T! Its great!"
1,Waste of Money,"If I could rate this system as 0 stars I would, but the review form doesn't give that option.The sound quality is very low, speakers have sounded tinny and crackly since I took it out of the box. It also skips badly, to the point of being unlistenable... even on brand-new CDs fresh out of the jewel case.The only pluses are its thin design and accessibility of RCA input/output plugs. This gives you the option to either input from a better sound source, or output to a better speaker... but of course it then begs the question of why you'd want this system in the first place."
5,Excellent binoculars for the money,"The swift audubon 8.5x44 porro prism has always been considered an excellent binocular for the money. This is a roof prism version of the same. These still live up the the reputation that the other audubons have established. While not quite as good as the other 8.5x roof prism, these are hard to beat especially when you factor in the cost of them. If you are in the market for a pair of binoculars in this price range definately give these a look."
5,Epilepsy and Sleep,"Though this is a medical book, I do understand the importance of sleep in relation to seizures. Dr. Dinner, my neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, wrote a very important book on the relationship between sleep and epilepsy. Those of us with epilepsy have to understnad the importance of getting enough sleep so as to not trigger a seizure. I would recomment this book for medical students."
4,Memorex floppy disks/file box,"I really like this product because I raise dogs and I can put each dog on with different colored disks and just look for the color and its easier to find instead of looking and looking through all my black floppies to find the right one.Thanks again,Karon"
3,Average 1970s Disney comedy,"This is a rare Disney film to find in any digital format and after watching, it's fairly easy to see why. Although it is funny at times, overall it just seems a little forced. I think Helen Hayes and her band of nannies are the most entertaining. The actors playing Asians are hard to watch with so much makeup caked on their faces.One of the best things about this is the pristine quality of the picture and sound, probably due to the fact that the film has rarely been handled and locked up tight in storage."
1,One of our dinosaurs is missing,The movie would have been great but the format I received can not be played in the US or with a computer.
2,6th Grader's Review,"This book is about two girl baseball teams. Both teams have a new girl on their team. This story takes place a few years after World War 2. Both teams are really looking forward to the big game, Bat 6. In every chapter different girls from one team talk and give their opinion about the things that happen during the book. One conflict is racism between Americans and Japanese. One character that was interesting to me is Shazam. Shazam is a girl who is on one of the baseball teams. She was interesting to me because of how much racism she had towards Japanese people.I did not like this book very much. I did not like it because the author had too much dialogue and not enough action. The author did a good job of describing the feelings of Shazam and how she hated Japanese people. Racism was a big effect on people back then, like Shazam. I think people who like sad books would like it because in the book something sad happens."
3,okay,"Bat 6 is okay. It's about this girl that hates Japanese and injures a Japanese girl. She broke her jaw. I thought it was okay, but it took a long time to get the exciting part and it had abrupt ending."
5,Andre Rieu - Christmas Around the world,"If you enjoy good orchestral music, spectacular costume of the Strauss era,interspersed with some humour, then this is for you.Andre and his orchestra provide an hour or so of uplifting entertainment."
4,Great addition to our holiday DVD collection.,"Like all the Andre Reiu DVDs, Christmas Around The World is a great find. However, his later DVDs have stronger production values. But it is still well worth the cost and rounds out the collection."
2,Not Worth The Money,"The only thing good about this product is the applicator. The software that comes with it is horrible. First of all, the printer alignment feature doesn't work, so it is impossible to align you graphics onto the paper so they will never be centered. And even the neat feature (which I thought) of having the words in circlular pattern around the outer edge of the CD looks fine on the screen but is ""squashed"" on the paper and looks horrible next to the unaligned picture graphic. Do NOT buy this product until a new version is out without all these bugs."
2,Bed Frame,"I received the bed frame quickly and the price appeared to be a good price. Within a week of use, the frame starting bending at the center wheel brackets. The frame also did not come with assembly instructions, so I had to assemble it through frustration and trial by error (hopefully correctly)."
2,Historical Interest,Probably groundbreaking in 1955 when it was written. Historically interesting in 1999.
1,Haven't received the product.,I haven't received the product I ordered on November 12th. It is currently December 14th. I am disappointed to say the least.
4,Works as advertised,"Good product reasonably priced. Takes a bit of getting used to for figuring out how to handle the flash exposure. I increased about 1/2 stop and does well on most subjects but distance is critical. If you are taking pic's on the fly, plan on bracketing or else fixing the exposure in your software later. I like this product and once I got the additional strap for fixing it on the flash it is easy to use.I found that I had to adjust the angle a bit by experimenting with the position of the side flaps to get the optimum flash bounce. I would recommend taking quite a few pics in various light ranges to figure before you go into a serious shooting."
4,Works great but diffussion screen is a miss on mine..,I will just say that I second the higher rated reviews with the exception of one thing about the system I received. The diffusion screen has the hook part of the velcro built onto tabs. The top tab of my diffussion screen simply will not connect. It is as thought the hooks are defective. Only one end of it comes close to locking in but it pops off. The other three tabs connect although you can tell they do not grab well. The small circular hook patches on the other inserts actually hold better than the entire hook surface on the large tabs of the diffussion screen.I would have liked to have seen the diffussion screen be made of fabric rather than plastic with better velcro hook surface.Other than that I love the system. I will keep it and probably try to make my own fabric diffusser.
5,The Cruel Sea,I was delighted to find this book to send my brother for Christmas - he's been wanting it for years. It arrived promptly and was in better condition that I expected. I would definitely purchase from this vendor in the future.
2,Don't hold up,"Never have I loved boots so much, and yet been so disappointed with them. Considering these are $300 boots, I expected them to last more than 2 seasons (a season being from November to March). The leather ripped so that I have holes in the boots where they crease from walking so they are not water proof at all.That being said, they look FABULOUS!!! But not for very long :("
5,I Love Container Gardening,"This book starts with the basic techniques: sowing seeds, choosing containers, watering, etc. It gets more in-depth with the care of houseplants, troubleshooting plant problems and how to do plant division.The plant guide includes a variety like cyclamen, dracina, monstera, asparagus fern and gardenias.There are sample planter combinations shown and the reader is told how to achieve that look. The samples include an herb garden container, one with winter colors, wild strawberries, cottage gardens, and a medley of pinks.Great variety, so I rate the book with 5 stars."
5,Gringos - Charles Portis,"I discovered Charles Portis when I recently read ""True Grit"". He is a very engaging author, and very humorous. I love his use of local dialect in his writing. Having recently been to Cancun, I found his description of it during the '60's to be very informative and fun to read about. Easy, fun read!"
3,Not too good player,"3* for sound. ESP works great. Sound quality is good, definitely better than 2 Sony(ESP broke) units I had, but AIWA interferes with all kinds of electric equipment. While listening to my music on the train and it was picking up a static noise from the electric engines of a train, same thing happened on the escalator. For me it's a NO!"
1,Sucks! Can hardly hear the music,Inferior quality! I got it new but can hardly hear the music through the attached headphone or through the speaker.
4,Its a good system,I spent the first 15 minutes figuring how the thing turned on and off. But the sound quality is great and it didn't skip even when I shook it. Good deal at this price!
1,"Why can't we give ""0"" stars?","This book was a complete waste of my time. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because the author has had some hits in the past that this tripe is worth your money OR your time!There were many offensive aspects to this book. However, the last line about the ""hero"" leaving the door open for a possible affair with one of the really beautiful (a/k/a rich) people in his circle of suspects really left a horrible taste in my mouth. The hero allowed for the possibility of an affair with this shallow, WASPY woman while his wife was carrying their second child! What a JERK!Don't waste your time!"
1,Boring!!!,"I had to give up on this book, it was just too boring! I thought it started out pretty good, but I didn't like how the book would go back in time, and it would go into too much detail over & over again."
3,Who didn't do it?,"A fair read for Hailey fans. His other books have been more interesting. I was disappointed at his attacks on the NRA, gun ownership and second ammendment rights. All in all I would still recommend it to regular Hailey fans."
4,"Pretty good, yet not very gripping !!",Similar to THE POET by M Connelley in may ways Yet the details are good.
2,Very disappointing!,It's hard to assign a rating to a book I didn't finish! It was quite boring!! I certainly don't need to know every move that everyone in the Detective Division makes every time he shows up for work. Not up to Hailey's previous novels. -Bob Davidso
4,Memorex 32020700 Jewel Case Inserts (50 Pack),"This is a nice product. However the software included is not that great. After receiving the product and seeing the paper type, I could have made my own jewel case inserts using card stock or plain computer paper. However the paper would have to be measured and cut to fit the jewel case.If do not want to have to measure and cut your jewel case inserts then this product is for you.2 star for the software included.4 star for the jewel case inserts."
2,Nice for home creations; not to be confused with Pro Labels,"Although one will immediately get the impression that these are great, easy to use labels, digging deeper, they begin to reveal their problems. It seems as if with every other printing job, the alignment is off, even when used with a very professional and versatile printer. The labels are great when printing simple CD-R booklets for friends, but be weary. Even independent bands will be dissatisfied with these thin matte labels."
3,Complicated Assembly,"I got these to label 40 Dvds that I was mailing out for a fundraiser convention. Creating the design wasn't too horribly difficult. But after printing, it took a few minutes EACH label, to tear out and put together into a CD case. I wasn't expecting the puzzle... There are several different tear-lines; you end up with more ripped off bits and pieces then actual pieces for the case. Then getting it to go together in the case was like a game. If I had just been making a personal cover/label for my own dvd, it wouldn't have seemed like such a hassle. But making 40, I had to do it over the course of 3 days. It was quite tiring.I guess, for the price I paid, they at least got the job done. But don't expect an easy process, is all I'm saying. I felt like I 'signed up' for something I hadn't quite bargained for... 'Course, I've also never assembled my own cd cover before, so it could very well be like this with all of them."
2,Not bad,"If you're strapped for cash and ABSOLUTELY have to buy a bike from Amazon, this appears to be a pretty good choice. It's not a whole lot cheaper than some entry level road bikes, once you factor in shipping(unless you can finagle free shipping). If you're handy and can make it fit you, go for it. But I still think most folks would get more bang for their buck with a nice used bike."
2,Save Your Money,"I have only used this on shun classic knives. While it does sharpen a dull knife, it does not do nearly as good of a job as having your knives professionally sharpened. I also fear it takes off much more metal than is necessary to achieve a new edge. Buy this only if you are exceedingly lazy about getting your knives sharpened and it won't happen any other way. Otherwise get your knives sharpened professionally. Shun will sharpen them for free if you don't mind shipping them to Japan (rolls eyes). I get mine done at Sur La Table; they charge an arm and a leg, but they specialize in Shun knives and do a great job."
3,An Underwater Story,"This book takes place in a magical land called Droon. The three friends, Eric, Julie and Neal are on their 12th adventure in Droon, seeking Demether, the underwater queen of the ocean. She has a red jewel she stole from Lord Spar, called the red eye of dawn. This jewel has a spirit in it which is making her yellow. This book has inspired me, and I would think many other people, to make up their own stories, to think about their own adventures in other worlds. I did not think this book was the best book I had ever read, because it really did not have that much action."
1,MORE PROBLEMS THAN PLEASURE,"At first I liked the unit very much. But about four months down the road I purchased a disc called ""Rasor Blade Smmile"". I locked the player, the all elctronic functions ceased to exsist, and had to be unplugged to retrieve the disc. After this about 50% of all other discs I put in the unit did exactly the same thing rendering the unit so wildly inconsistant that the unit became useless. (Note: these other discs had played fine before the ""locking"" incident.) This happened after the first three months making it less expensive replace the unit (with a much more dependable, if less glitzy,Toshiba unit). Also, the jog shuttle NEVER functioned correctly."
2,Tough Break,"I loved this DVD when i bought it, but then i had a run in with then i ran into TWO movies i couldn't play on it. I don't know what it is, but ever since then, i just dont' TRUST it... other than that, its great. I just thought i could watch ANY movie...."
1,not worth,I just connected my laptop to a external monitor.It worked fine for 5 mins and then lost the connection by itself.The cable does not work anymore.Not worth buying.
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"I just received this cable and I am very pleased with it so far. It arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery time which makes me very happy. It performs as advertised, hey, it's just a cable. NOTE - If you are going to use HDMI cables on any project, just keep in mind that the cable doesn't support audio, which I just found out."
5,Great experience!,"My purchase couldn't have been better: perfect product, unbelievably wonderful price/shipping/handling, and arrival was extremely fast. Outrageously good!"
1,Didn't do what I needed it for,"I was trying to connect an older Mac Mini to my HDTV. When I connected it, the tv said ""not supported"". I don't know if this was a fault in the cable or the computer or the tv, but this configuration didn't work."
5,very good,we got the cable got what we order and got it very fast just what i like not to pay extra to get it faster
2,Not working,"Not sure if it's my tv, or because of the cable, but I'm getting a message on my TV that says mode not compatible or something to that effect."
1,Not accurate,"The picture does not match the cable, the center pins are missing.This cable is as thick as a headphone/mouse type cable, it cannot have a good shield or wire size."
4,You get what you pay for.,"My graphics card only has 1 DVI port, so I used this to connect my second monitor. Worked great for over a year until I was packing up my computer and forgot to disconnect this cable. Bent the connector roughly 25. ""No big deal,"" I figured, since I've done this to many USB and other various cables in the past, ""I'll just bend it back"". When I did, the connector snapped right off. Yeah, it's my fault for bending the tip to begin with, but still, it shouldn't've broken off so easily.Since they're so cheap I'll just buy another one, but keep in mind the poor build quality next time."
1,Cable Sent Not The Same As Picture,The cable I recieved has DVI 18 pin male side and the picture shows a 24 pin. Should have read the reviews on here more carefully.
5,Exactly what it says,"I use this cable to connect my computer dvi output to a tv hdmi connector. Great price, quick delivery and accurate product info."
2,DVI TO HDMI,It did not work and the package was destroyed so I did not return it.It did not work and the package was destroyed so I did not return it. It would cost me more to return. Verses taking a loss.
1,This is an amazing product!!!,Length:: 0:36 MinsI used this with my PS3 and my HD monitor and it looks fantastic!
1,May not work with large displays?,"Just purchased this cable, and it seems to have trouble displaying content from my computer to a 1080p TV... will try again with another brand."
1,defective unit,"Unit was defective upon receipt, the screen would simply not get a signal out of this particular cable. Tried with another cable to verify that other components in the setup were working as intended and to isolate the issue. I guess I got what I paid for."
5,aluminum frame,"This is an excellent bicycle for the money. It's a ""value"" line, no top of the line components, but all function well. My wife likes this because it's light weight thanks to the aluminum frame. We've had it almost two years with no problems so far."
4,Beautiful,"An amazing bike easy to put together nice to ride. I would expected a comfort bike in this price range would come with a more ""comfortable"" saddle. Eventhough it has springs and cushion, riding for half hour or more may be painful. This great bike should come with a nicer gel seat. I did not find convinient having to buy a new seat for a brand new bike of this price. I understand other accesories are mandatory and I bought them, not a seat."
1,utter .............,this book is a lot of utter ........ that should never have been printed. it is a blatant attempt to cash in on the romanov tragedy. anna anderson WAS anastasia and dubious dna tests will not change that.
1,Tasteless and boring,"Disappointing, in line with her other mediocre cookbooks. No imagination with flavors. She does earn one star for consistently good presentation, otherwise I would give her a zero."
3,well....,"the look is great the style is neat, and the idea precedes all others. but to be honest the sound quality is moderate-poor. I was expecting big with the 6 speaker 'surround' sound but was disappointed with it. The sound was leaving something desired. hey but the lights on it were COOL!!!"
3,Finders Will Be Keepers of this Delightful Book.,"A wonderful book for multi-tasking, multi-talented people who love to put creative personality into their craft projects. Riley's instructions and ideas make for page after page of motivation to create your ownn original family heirlooms.""Scraps: Adventures in Scrapbooking"" got me into the joys of cropping and journal-keeping, and this book motivated me to take the next joyful leap."
4,New perspectve,"This book would be much better spiral bound as it is essentially a ""how to"" book. The book covered an art style I do not understand and so I found her writing eye opening. It provided an opportunity to see things in a different light. This book is timely, detailed and the instructions well thought out. She certainly is knowledgeable and experienced in the techniques discussed. It has rattled my cage and I plan to take a class from her at the International Quilt Festival in Houston this fall."
5,Quite simply brilliant.,"One of the finest series for young people written in the last 20 years. This book begins a dark, disturbing, exciting, funny, honest and - ultimately - wonderful journey. It is what far too much fiction for young people is NOT. It's intelligent, complex and brave, while never retreating into cynicism. I'm 46 and I love these books. My teenagers have devoured them all. If your world revolves around stories that enliven and reveal then read these or buy them for your kids."
2,Outdated Metamorphosized Western Frameworks,"This book smells of an engineer turned management consultant. The author has a fettish for paradigm overkill. Sadly, his ideas leave you wonderding, ""haven't I seen that somewhere before."""
1,An arrogant collection of repetitions,"As a business school graduate student, I have read a significant amount of strategy books and articles. This book is just an arrogant collection of repetitions. It does not provide any new insights."
1,Pocket mail went bankrupt in february 2010,"The company behind this device went bankrupt and without giving notice to their paying customers stopped everything including service and support. More or less they closed the office, servers, telephone lines and went in hiding.[...]"
2,My dog didn't like this bone,"My dog chewed on this for about 10 min., but then hasn't touched it again. I can't speak to the bone's durability since it didn't get much use. I was told not to give my dog rawhide, so I was looking for a safe alternative. Unfortunately, since my dog didn't like this bone, this wasn't the answer."
3,"Some good ,some bad","It took me listening 3 times through to get a feel for this quirky CD. Afew of the songs are good but a few are not so good. The bluesey tunes leave much to be desired, but some of the up tempo stuff is good. Also, a swing tune ? I can't decide what this band is trying to be. The overall sound is good but nothing really "" moved"" me."
3,"Very Small, Dog wouldn't eat it!","I was shocked at how small this container was! It is costly for the size. I gave a taste to my dog and he played with it, dropped it, and only ate it when the other do came around to investigate. I have more dog to test it on so I haven't given up, but so far I am a bit disappointed."
4,theories of personality,"this book was in good condition and sent in a timely manner, I highly recommend this seller"
2,"SLOW start, SLOW middle, couldn't FINISH","I was disappointed to find that when I picked up this book at the library, I thought it was going to be a laugh a minute. It was constant inturruptions in the story line with one character intruding and then another taking over the story. It was so annoying, I couldn't believe Dinah would let the ""hijackers"" of the storyline lead her around. I mean, if she was really as intent on finding her ""yellow-bellied snake"" of a fiance, then she wouldn't be going on wild goose chaces all over the country. I was mostly on Seth's side throughout the book. Get the storyline moving in a different direction. And all the people jumping in to give soooooo much opinions at the same time was soooooo annoying. I think the author put a little too much effort in trying to make the book good. The story would have been a lot better if she would've kept the not-so-important characters to a minimum. Sad to say, I couldn't even finish the book."
5,Prenatal Yoga,"I found this video to be very helpful during my pregancy - especially the relaxation portion at the end of the tape. I was lucky enough to take classes from Collette during my first pregnancy but had less free time during the second, so this was a great way to remember all the moves and do it when I could and at my own pace. The explanations are clear and are repeated so those that do not have access to classes will find it very usefull."
4,worth the price,"This computer desk is a well built unit and worth the price for an inexpensive work station. It fits perfectly into one side of a bedroom closet and is totaly invisable with the door closed.My only complaint is that the assembly instructions were obviously not writen by english speaking American's.but with a bit of common sence I'm sure you'll figure it out, I did."
1,COMIC BOOK ON DVD!!!,"Anybody out there looking for some good Anime, this isn't the DVD for you. This is literally a comic book on DVD and im not a fan."
1,Buy the comic book,This is just one of those comics on dvd. Idid not know that is what it was. The story is good. As all the street fighter without live action are. It looks like they are just blowing this up frame by frame. If you like comics read to you by dvd this is your product if not buy ths book.
5,An Absolute MUST read for parents and teachers,This is the most important book on the social jungle that I have seen. I have taught school for 20 years and have a 14 year old daughter and a 10 year old son... I have read lots of books. This one should be required reading for teachers. The crises that are occurring in schools today can absolutely be traced to the clique behavior described in this book. It's time to open our eyes and recognize what is going on. This book gets the point across and gets started on doing something about it.
3,Okay Purchase,Purchased along with sweetner. The product is like those used in restaurants and holds different sugar packets of various descriptions.
5,"Great Price, and practical",Great price and practical. I bought it for my nespresso machine to hold my sugar and sweeteners. Does just the trick and is minimalist.
3,What's Happened to Simplicity?,"After hearing the first selection, I thought I would be really impressed. Carl Fontana and Frank Rossolino are great trombonists - no doubt about that. But it seemed to me that this album became a contest between the two of them as to who could play the most notes when soloing. So, who's needs are being met? I have a hunch that Carl and Frank's needs have overridden those of the audience. If this is the yardstick by which we measure trombonists, then I will plead ignorance of the jazz genre. Frankly,after several selections, their solos became monotonous. So what's happened to tasteful simplicity especially in a song like STARDUST.Phil Teele did an admirable job with the bass trombone. The rhythm section was top-notch. A few of the arrangements (primarily by Bob Florence) were creatively constructed and beautifully played. But for my money, I'll take the sound of Tutti's Trombones."
1,Returned!,"Was really excited about this when I got it, only to find that it is defective! It looks like the top was manufactured improperly, so the stirrer/lid doesn't fit together."
3,Review by Scanning and OCR Teacher,"So far this is the only book I know of available on OCR and I have been researching over four years for two scanning classes I teach at a local community college. This probably is because not many people who own scanners actually have need of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Those who do, such as office workers and librarians, will learn a great deal about preparing documents before attempting to scan/ocr. The author obviously has been involved in OCR since early days and provides manual solutions rather than explaining features in newer and more helpful OCR software. Creating forms in OCR is not covered."
4,Basic Wayne,As with most every thing John Wayne did these are both workman like and typical movies. These are two more of the B movies the Duke did while learning how to really act the macho he man.
5,Absolutely revelatory,This book really opened up my spiritual eyes. I am going to preaching a lot different now that I understand the truth. No wonder I could never make much sense out of what most preachers said about who Jesus is. I recommend this book for everyone who wants to know God and how Jesus relates to God.
2,Too hard!,I liked the concept of the game but the controls are just too hard for my 6 year old and I wasn't much help! The mini games that you need to complete use the arrow keys rather than the mouse and we kept getting stuck (the driving one was quite confusing). I don't think most young kids will be able to get through this game even on the easiest level. It was more frustrating than fun and we just gave up.
1,Not much here,"There's no original research here; as is clear from the footnotes, the author has just taken material from standard biographies of Sanger and used it to present her in the most negative light possible. Sanger did favor eugenics (as did most people in her era), and she was a socialist, and she had a rather unorthodox family life. There isn't much argument about the facts. But to use these facts to portray her as a monster of iniquity (and a worse murderer than Stalin or Hitler) is just silly. Actually, Sanger's work has almost certainly reduced the incidence of abortion by making birth control more accessible and reliable."
3,Dover reprint of outdated edition,"Haydn's piano sonatas were composed over almost 50 years, and range from rather undistinctive rococco pieces to great masterworks of the genre. These are not always so easy to play and require some knowledge of classical style and ornamentation.I learned several sonatas from these Dover editions, which fit the bill when I was economizing, as they are the cheapest complete edition out there. Unfortunately, they are a reprint of an outdated 19th C. edition, with a layout somewhat difficult to read, and not always well-printed. Much better as an investment is the Henle edition, in three volumes, despite the significantly greater cost."
3,too many options,"This book has a ton of juicing recipes....TOO Many juicing recipes. I think I would get more use out of it if they put in FEWER, TASTIER juicing recipes instead of just every combination under the sun. I guess it depends on what you're looking for."
4,Juicin',"Product rec'd in good shape, however it took a long time to get it, nearly a month.The book gives you lots of information, and I'm sure I will use it, but I don't think I am into juicing as much as I thought I would be. Am not sure I would select this seller as first choice if I were ordering again, just because it took so long to receive the product. Otherwise, they were fine."
2,fast forward,this movie would be good if the cast spoke english my kids were disapoined especially my nine year old daughter she is in love with dance movies
3,Dark and depressing abyss,"The main problem I have with this book is that essentially, with rare exceptions, everything that takes place in the aftermath. Whether it is a hotel in decay, or a failed farm, or disintegrating relationship, or the broken damaged remains of a man. Unfortunately seeing only the decay without understanding at all how things came to be makes everything futile and senseless. The ending is especially senseless. To be effective we need to understand the necessity of this turn of events even if it comes from a disturbed perspective. Only a racist would accept the flow of events as a natural outcome of all that came before, because they tacitly accept that it is the nature of certain people to behave in such a manner without reason."
5,The BEST book on Mutual funds you can Buy,"Love this book for two reasons. First, it has lots of unique and non-intuitive things to say about mutual funds and investing. Second, John says those things in such a definitive, persuasive and compelling way that he has persuaded me that he's right. This book will change the way you invest, increasing returns and lowering risk at the same time. This is no get-rich-quick scheme. It's also a mud-pie in the face of the mutual fund industry which typically skims 1.5% from your assets before you get any returns."
1,yuck!,"This book is terrible! Don't waste your money or time. Unless you like sick, evil, garbage, junk books. YUCK!"
3,"Great nature film for it's generation, but showing it's age","The knowledge imparted and some of the footage is really great quality, but by today's standards the DVD's are no beginning to look a bit old."
4,"Great, but Time Life messed up!","This early Attenborough is great. the info, as far as i can tell, isn't incorrect, and the material is different enough from 'planet Earth' to justify buying both. It is cool to see a younger Attenborough. Unfortunately, Time Life Video messed up! First of all, all of the documentaries are out of the original order. But more importantly, Time Life, for some odd reason, cut out Attenborough's ending speech, where he says something like: ""And that's what we'll see in the next episode"". In the second to last episode (about the ocean) they even cut him off mid sentence! However, if you ignore that, these videos are great."
4,"Excellent, but get version 2 DVD","The program is EXCELLENT, and I've watched it many times on VHS. Unfortunately, the region 1 DVD has been edited and I was very disapointed to find that most of the sections had been shortened. From what I understand, the region 2 DVD is not edited. So if I had it to do over, I would buy the region 2 DVD from amazon.co.uk instead."
1,Listen to the sample before you buy!,"I was so excited over the reviews this CD got that I went ahead and bought it w/o listening to the sample. Boy, was that a mistake! This woman's voice is so annoying! She hesitates and pauses so frequently and sounds very uncomfortable. This in turn makes me uncomfortable and I can't relax. I've tried using it several times because of the money I paid, but I just end up agitated and turning it off. If you're looking for a fantastic meditation CD, try Louise Hay's ""Meditations for Personal Healing"" and Susie Mantell's ""Your Present: A Half Hour of Peace""."
4,Fall Asleep While Listening,"I got this for stress issues, but every time I listen to it I can't get past the first few minutes without falling asleep. Very relaxing voice and music!"
3,Great for beginners...,"After unsuccessfully trying to meditate on my own, I decided to purchase a guided meditation cd. Not quite knowing what to expect, I tried to allow myself to get into the flow of the meditations. Mary's voice is very soothing, so much so that the first few times I listened, I fell asleep only to find myself being jarred awake because of the inconsistent pitch in her voice. I think the music is soothing but I couldn't really hear it the way I would have liked. Overall, I think it's a good cd for those new to meditation and feel they may need a little guidance."
1,same old same old- ----rehash,It's been done before- the same stuff as in every other book on this subject- there's nothing new added.
2,horrible,"I think this proves the old saying that.... those that can...do; and those that can't.... teach -or in this case, ""write""."
5,Great Product,Really easy to fill! Excellent adjustments. Great handle design and easy on the hands. Why do I need to say more?
1,DOES NOT WORK RIGHT,"I bought this 34 days ago and it never has worked properly. The fine grind nothing comes out, the medium grind barely makes it out, and the coarse grind is only one which will produce any pepper! I contacted Williams Bound, they said they would wave the shipping return fee but I have to pay for the return. I asked if I could upgrade to their best product which I would pay the difference and was told to contact Amazon. Amazon has a policy of no-guarantee after 30 days, so I am suck in the middle. I am sending the Key Mill pepper mill for repairs and/or replacement, this is what a supervisor customer service representative named Angela explained to me. I guess I'll have to wait and see what happens. I definitely would not buy this product again because it is costing me more in the long run than advertised by Amazon, 4 (four)days too late - you have to be joking!"
2,Not for low temperature use,The specs state this adhesive works down to -40C. I followed the instructions to the letter to bond a thermo electric cooler to a copper heatsink. The heatsink is kept at 0C and the cold side of the TEC at roughly -20C. Under these conditions the bonding strength is so weak that I had no trouble removing the TEC from the heatsink. While this stuff might work fine at higher temperatures it does not perform well at all at low temperatures. And I as only halfway down to the lowest temperature this stuff is advertised to work at. I realize that the bonding strength is slightly less below 0 C but this just doesn't work at all.
1,Never got the product,"This item should be rated 0 star.Ordered this item from Amazon. Received confirmation with a shipment date of Sept 29. On Sept 29, received a cancellation notice from Amazon. Why does it take Amazon almost two months to notify me that the item could not be 'sourced'?"
1,DVD Region not known,"The DVD region was listed as not known, but on delivery to relative in Barcelona as a Xmas gift he could not play it. Money wasted unless he can pass it on to an American friend!This should have been made clear as the original posting address was to Scotland.Not pleased!"
1,How Sad,I bought the album and was throughly disapointed .Fallons droning voice and the mediocre lyrics tend not to ever stick in any ones mind .this album is totally [weak]...
5,Awesome,I bought these for running to prevent blisters. I love them! They provide a bit of extra cushion for my feet and it feels like your feet are in soft plush cotton. I haven't had any rubbing or blisters since using these and they don't bunch down in my shoes like other socks but rather hold their fitting on my foot throughout their whole wear. I would highly recommend.
4,good info....not a super polished book,"this book is informative but some of the treatments are either outdated or not available in the u.s. there is some good info in the book but i prefer ""breaking out"" for good easy to understand information and treatments."
5,"If my son had come with an instruction manual, this would be it.","This is, hands down, the most helpful, concise, and eye-opening book out there on the subject of dealing with ""difficult moments."" If my son had arrived in our home in a cardboard box on a bed of styrofoam packing peanuts, this would surely have been packed alongside him. Alas, he is a real person, so there were no instructions for dealing with the befuddling, frustrating, and unpredictable aspects of his meltdowns and rages. Happily, we have grown many years beyond all that, and largely with the help of this book. A must-read for parents, teachers, and psychologists."
3,Not Impressed,"This book wasn't at all what I expected, although it did have some good information. I found it to be geared towards AS students who are having a hard time in the public school system. It would be an excellent book if this is your current situation. However, for homeschooling a kindergartener the information was not all that valuable and I would suggest that you look at other books first."
1,A Travesty to all Opera's,"This opera is a mockery of Carmina Burana, When they were supposed to sing fast, then sang slow. When They were supposed to sing slow, they sang fast. The first soprano sounded like she was a true alto. Last, but certainly not least, the ending of the mundi is one of the most dramatic parts of the opera...and they used pretty little bells. In other words, If you like this opera, dont buy this version."
3,a good book for new mail admins,"I wished it had gone into more depth, but it is a good book for beginning UNIX email administrators."
1,Don't bother.,"I'm afraid that it's a pretty bad book. The characters were utterly shallow and cartoonish, especially the men. Instead of giving the men names, the author could have just called 'em The Rapist, The Bad Father, The Bad Man, and The Good Man. Or he could have collectively named them The Straw Men. How much more interesting it would have been if Dante and what's his name -- The Good Man -- had been a single character. That would have given some heft to Dolores' decision to stay or go. Although Dolores was better sketched, she was still only allowed (by the author) to have one defining trait at any giving time.There was simply nothing creative about this book. Anyone could have written it.For all the reviewers out there who can't believe a man could have written such a great female character, check out Norman Rush's ""Mating."" A much, much better example."
5,Simply Beautiful!,"This book shed an entirely new, beautiful light on my perspective of life! What an amazing novel Wally Lamb has written! I felt throughout the entire novel that I knew Dolores. I wanted to share her burdens, lessen her pain, and at the least be her 'true' friend. This is a tale of an amazing personal journey through life (true life), and most importantly, the long road to self-actualization. I hope this novel has taught people to believe in themselves, that there is a better life, is so desired, and to have compassion for other people and their often unintended mistakes."
3,Totally Depressing,"This book started out well, I was beginning to like it until the story became too depressing as its unravel, the character's not likeable at all"
2,check this one out at the library,"Readers seem to love or hate ""She's Come Undone."" The story is compelling and the references to old tv shows are fun for those of us who remember getting our first color tv. But the writing is poor and the character development sorely lacking. Dolores is supposed to be bright and lovable, but we never once see any evidence of that, she merely seems to hang on through every conceivable nasty experience. I finished reading this, but I'm sure not waiting for another book by the same author"
2,Pass the razor blade!,"A depressing journey of a girl to womanhood, that is neither insightful or inspiring. At first I thought that I wasn't relating to the era this storyline took place, but soon realized that no matter how you cut it, it is a story written by a man in a women's perspective. It just didn't work"
1,Disturbing and uninteresting.,"I REALLY tried to like this book. I put it down and picked it up at least a dozen times (still trying to finish it and over half way through). The main character is SO HORRENDOUS! She makes me insane. You know, I've loved books about unsympathetic crazy people in the past, but this one misses the mark. Maybe they've got to be written by women to make that emotional connection. It wasn't that Wally Lamb's writing style was bad even. He's a very good writer - it's the people he chooses to create that are so miserable."
3,"Okay, but slow at times","It was a very slow read to begin with, but became more interesting as it went on. She had a lot of terrible things happen to her where I kept thinking it would be better for her and it wasn't. I did enjoy the writing style, and if I had not known the writer was a male it wouldn't have mattered. All in all I would recommend the book, but it wasn't a page turner. It was sad at times and a little depressing."
5,Astonishing...captures the tenacity of the human spirit...,"I read this book when it first came out in the early '90s, and have read it twice more since then. Delores is the embodiment of the human spirit, a beautiful example of the force and power we all possess. A powerful woman who not only survives, but thrives against all odds. This is a book to lose yourself in...I felt as if I was travelling alongside Delores throughout her journey. Wally Lamb's ability to speak the female voice is truly amazing. I can't wait to read his newest novel, for I know that it will get under my skin and become a part of me...just like this one!"
5,One Of The Best I've Ever Read,"This book is top notch in everything: the writing, which is nothing less than outstanding; the characterization; the plotline. Finally, a character who is human, who is so perfectly flawed. I get tired of reading books where the character is perfect and whatever happens to them is someone else's fault. But Dolores is a victim of her own faults. She is so real, it is unbelivable. And yes, a lot of reviewers (I haven't read them--who has time to read almost a thousand reviews?) have probably commented on the fact that a man wrote so convincingly from a woman's point of view, but that's just the mark of a good writer."
2,A depressing read,"The book cover say that this book is ""hilarious"" and touchingly funny. I would say this book is neither and is merely depressing. If you are looking for an entertaining, fun, up-lifting read, do not read this book. The book includes themes of divorce, rape, nervous breakdowns, institutionalization, dealth of just about every loved one that exists, HIV/AIDS . . . . At about 3/4's of the way through it, I began to wonder if ANYTHING good was EVER going to happen to the main character. Finally about 25 pgs. before the end, it brightened up a bit but with still very weighty material mixed in.I think the author is very talented. He DID make me feel he had a great idea of what it is like to be a woman. His style is great too. But that is the best part of this book."
4,Okay read,"After reading I Know This Much is True, I read this book. Maybe if I had read it first, I would have liked it more, but it really pales when the two books are compared. I did find it easy to read and enjoyable. I was just expecting more."
5,"excellent, top-notch","this is one of the better books that oprah has selected. i found the main character to be believable, endearing and someone i would like to know. even though i suspect we all know a few people like her. people who seem to have a tougher road to travel than many of us, who for whatever reason, just don't seem to get any breaks. my favorite parts of the book are near the end, especially when her dying friend tells her ""accept what people offer, drink their milkshakes. Take their love"" too often we go about life thinking that perfection or happiness is just around the corner, when in reality all we have is today and that happiness is a by-product not a pursuit. the best line in the book is ""the secret (to happiness) is to just settle for the shape your life takes."""
4,Amazing...,"In my senior year of high school we had the option of choosing any book to read. I had heard of ""She's Come Undone"" and thought it sounded alright, so I decided to read it. Usually books written by men about women in such a close perspective, turn out skewed from a woman's point of view. At first I was skeptical about his writing from such a personal view of a woman's life. But this book was amazing, I couldn't put it down. It being the first of Lamb's books I have read I was completely intrigued by it.The young girl in the novel, experiences everyday events such as her parents divorce, weight problems and marital abuse, and can still have the will power to overcome them. She is an amazing character and Lamb describes her personality and physical characteristics very well. This is a must read, and is a book you will never forget! This book will have you smiling at one point, reaching for Kleenex the next minute, and be a book you will pass on from friend to friend."
2,Predictable Mediocrity,"Mr. Lamb managed to capture my attention by promising a smart, funny, slighly cynical coming of age novel-but really let me down with Delores. She is the product of the first thought of a fat abused woman that comes to the most unimaginitive of minds. This book made me feel as if all humankind has some dirty motive behind it's every action. There are thousands of books out there so much more worth my while, and worth the while of all those people who read this book at Oprah's bidding. Kudos to her for bringing forth unknown authors, but there is a reason some should remain unknown......"
3,Definitely not a page turner.,"I recently read this book for a local book club. Although it was an easy read and somewhat held my interest, I was a little disappointed. This book was totally hyped up for no apparent reason. It just went from one sorry scene to the next. But I must say that Wally Lamb's style of writing was great."
5,Amazing,"Deep enough for the serious reader; simple enough for the beginner. Touching, hilarious, fulfilling. You will fall in love with Dolores Claiborne; laughing, crying, beciming a part of her soul. A must read for anyone of any age."
3,Depressing,"This book was very depressing. Judging by everyone else's glowing remarks, I guess I just don't get it. I could have done without reading it."
4,A book I will always keep on my night stand.,"Lamb does an exquisite job of telling a heart-breaking story with such compassion. This book evolked a large range of emotions in me. It was hard for me to look at food when she was in her severely obese stages and shoving down an 18 lb roast. Although I found some topics in here a little far-fetched, she always found a way to surprise me. An OUTSTANDING character that I can relate to, as will most other women."
2,"Delores is memorable, the story itself is too overdone","This is a page turner for sure - but that does not equate to great writing my any means. Yes, the story has lots of unexpected twists and turns, but then it has several overly predictable ""oh-I-can't-believe-he-just-went-there"" moments.You become quite fond of Dolores, the main character - and you cheer for her on and off. However, there is such an overwhelming artificial grittyness to her, which makes her little more than the tired stereotype of the ""self-destructing fat girl"".Furthermore, the ""in-your-face-sybmbolism"" such as the beached whale scenario is so cheesy it almost hurts...Overall, a decent book for the beach or the stair master - but great literature it is not."
1,Horrid.,"Horrid. Dreadful. By the middle of the book, I just wanted the main character to shut up and stop whining, already. Ugh! And the author evidently has some serious issue with fat women."
5,Great Read!,I liked this book. Any woman can relate to the character in some way or another. It is a quick read and thought revoking.
1,Way Over-Hyped,"Ridiculous plot, poorly written, uninteresting characters. With all the millions of GOOD books out there, don't waste your time with this one."
4,She's Come Undone,"I enjoyed this book, it did hold my attention and left me wondering what would happen next altho I will admit to being slightly disappointed after finishing Wally Lamb's other book ""I Know This Much is True"". THAT book I would give at least 4 if not 5 stars so I wanted to read another book by Lamb. While this was a good book, I didn't enjoy it as much ...but I did enjoy it nonetheless."
5,"Sad, but worth the tears!","Well, Oprah has done it again. She picked a terrific book to depress us all. Doesn't it seem like everything she selects is meant to give tear ducts a workout? Anyway, I really enjoyed this, and am shocked that a man could write so well from a womans point of view. A wonderful truimph!"
4,Great book! Good storyline and definitely not boring!,"I love this book, but then I love all of Wally Lamb's books. Read this one first, then read ""I Know This Much is True"". It's a little more challenging, which I like, but it's around 900 pages, so have fun!!!"
2,"No plot, no reality, no good.","This unbelievable life of an obese young girl was a waste of money as well as time. By the time you are 100 pages into the book, you feel obligated to finish it, just because you've read so much trash that you dare Wally Lamb to feed you even more, which he does. The only worthy aspect of this book is Lamb's cunning ability to speak as a woman... but 300 pages of unsubstantial text far outweighs even this feat"
5,I've read it twice since April!,"This book is easy to read and entertaining, yet if carefully dissected, the symbolic strata are absolutely fascinating!Having just been required to read Sylvia Plath's ""the bell jar"" for school, this book supplied a final resolution to the angst.I laughed out loud, wept, was angry was scared.Dolores Price (the protagonist) makes lemonade out of the proverbial lemon - after much painful squeezing and straining of pulp.My one question to the author would be ""is this a post modernist novel?"" I fear it may become a movie of the week! Which maywin Mr. lamb fame and fortune, but will leave me wondering if the fragmentation was a commercial ploy. If the use of mixed media and time lapse was done, like in Stone Diaries, for artistic purposes or as a variation (commercial break) to attract the masses."
5,"Smart, funny ironic, erotic, depressing yet touching.","I possitivly loved this book more than any other i'd ever read. it told the story of Doloris Price, a young fat girl growing up in a like of painful hell. living her whole life along with her as she ironically follows her mother's unusual life pattern, i found this book unlike any other i'd ever read or heard of."
3,"Depressing, but you just can't put it down.","I must admit, I picked up the book in the store due to Oprah's endorsement. Despite a busy schedule, I couldn't put it down. I felt that Lamb made an earnest effort to get into the skin of a girl/woman who suffered all Dolores endured. However, I agree with a friend who commented: ""Although he tried, his writing still had too many square-ish angles to have been written by a woman. It should have had a more rounded, more connected feel."" I didn't mind the not-very-happy ending, but I felt that Dolores' mental illness and fear of men could have been more realistically treated, more three-dimensional. Honestly, after reading the book, I'm not sure if I enjoyed it exactly. And I'm not terribly eager to read _I Know This Much Is True_, because I would rather not get that depressed by a book."
4,she's come undone,"awesome, perfectly awesome. It throughly suprises me how you can read the same book over and over and get more and more out of it each time. I think that most women would really enjoy this book and can relate to some or lotts of the emotions that Delores goes thought. Totally suprising that a man can write female emotions so beautifully... good job Wally!"
3,"A good read, but emotionally tiring.","Poor Delores. So much hate and hurt in that young woman. Enough to manipulate the emotions of the reader as well. The book starts off strong and wimpers in the end, contrary to what happens within Delores. The book leaves the reader frustrated with Delores' uphill battle that she mostly imposes on herself. The author really dropped the ball on the ending."
4,Wally Lamb has won my attention!,"This is a touching story. I found myself drawn in as Dolores evolved clumsily from being a bruised and battered child into a cautiously optimistic, loving, more confident woman. The story of Dolores is not a unique one. Many women face the same trials that Dolores stumbles through. This is a story about real life - a life of secrets and pain - a life that many women live and keep hidden in the dark. Lamb does a successful job of allowing us to share Dolores' pain and triumps. Arguably, however, I don't feel that Lamb was completely effective writing from a woman's prespective. In my opininion, Dolores' character (especially adolescence) had male persona. Maybe this was intentional by Lamb to emphasize Dolores' feeling of uniqueness and lonliness. This read requires a little patience and an empathetic heart. I do recommend it."
1,Whatever. Who cares? I didn't. Oprah strikes out...again!,"Trivial, boring work from a writer who obviously writes well. I hated this book. I didn't care about the heroine, didn't like her but didn't care enough to hate her. Weak characters. Dull plot. Blah, blah, blah... Does anyone at Oprah's book club really know how to read? What can they be thinking? How about promoting some really fine writers from the back shelves who are seldom noticed, Oprah? This isn't one of them."
2,She's Come Undone,"Miss Price is an amazing woman who shares her struggles with the world. Enduring rap, abuse, and a mentally ill mother, she can't help but rapidly gain weight. This book is by far one of the most depressing books I have read and instantly made me hate all men. I'm still not sure if this is appropriate to file under the ""favorite"" catagory. Dolores Price is not unforgettable but definatley worth listening to."
3,"Good story, less than real characters","Somehow, I just never felt that Dolores Price was a real woman. Sure, she was a real person, but there was something missing for me in the character as a woman that lacked a certain realism. Unlike the characters in ""I Know This Much is True,"" these characters stay relatively flat. In spite of this, the story is quite entertaining, and at times, thought provoking. I was left contemplating just how much happiness we are ""given,"" and how much we can create for ourselves through our choices and perceptions."
2,What an unfailingly annoying character,"I am generally an easily pleased reader, but I could not wait to finish this book. I found Dolores so annoying that she actually put me into a bad mood. She is dramatic, whiny, and self-absorbed. She never really improved, she just expressed the crazy in slightly different ways. If I had the ability to put a book down once I started, I would have done it with this book. Instead, I trudged through to the end, becoming more and more irritated with her character. The only redeeming quality of the book is that it does capture the long-felt impacts of traumatizing events, rather than having the main character go through a brief and trite journey to happiness as so many other books do."
2,A BIG LET DOWN!,"I had high hopes for this book. I was told by many people how wonderful Wally Lamb is, but I could not find anything great about this novel. The characters are lacking the realness that would make the story believable. I could care less what happened to these people and I was more intrested in getting to the last page."
2,She's Come Undone,"It is obvious that this is Lamb's first novel. I had a hard time identifying with Dolores, the main character. Although her childhood into early adulthood went through many phases, each phase was severely fragmented and her persona was disconnected. Lamb made a valient effort, but it was painfully evident that this woman's character was written by a man. Characters came into the plot, would play a substantial part, and then just disappear. I made myself finish the book, but overall it was difficult to get through. I do not doubt that Lamb has improved as a writer, as his books have generally gotten good reviews - for me, however, his first effort just fell too short."
1,Unbelievable...too long...too depressing,"I read this book expecting the central character to overcome her trials of youth (isolation, obesity, rape, addition to television, etc...)and blossom into a strong, motivational character. Instead I got one tragedy after another. I tossed this book into the wall when I finished. I found it a little unbelievable that so many tragic events could happen to one girl before she was even 20 years old. There were too many characters that had minimal importance to the story. The part that really upset me was her turbulent marriage to Dante where she apologized for everything he said and did to her. Then in the last 2 chapters marries Thayer based on convenience in effort to have a baby. Whatever! The book ultimately dragged on and on to a very anti-climactic ending. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Did not meet expectations,"Now that I've read it (admittedly only skimming the last 40 or so pages) I can't understand what all the hoopla was about. This book is nothing more than a soap opera with all the usual twists of fate - bad marriages, affairs, rape, death (lots of deaths, all perfectly timed). I was expecting a lot more from this book, but it's constant barrage of ""incidents"" left me yawning. It was like a movie where you already know beforehand how everything's going to turn out."
5,What a great book!!,"I read this book a long time ago but have never forgotten it. It's one of those books that you can truly relate to. Wally Lamb is such a great author, I just wish he'd write another book again soon."
4,I wasn't sure about this at first....,"When I first started reading this book, I had mixed feelings. I wasn't sure if I really wanted to read about this girl going through so much. I was afraid it would be too depressing. As it turns out, after I finished it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. The story is about Dolores Price and how she deals with her parents breakup, her mother's break down and living with Grandma. A turning point in her life at 13 causes her to overeat, her mother to stuff her full to cover her guilt, and then eventually her own mental breakdown. She recovers, determined to make a life of her own. Eventually she gets married to the man she dreamed of for many years. When that starts to unravel, she realizes she can make it on her own without a husband. I liked this, I have to say, and was glad it had a ""happy"" ending. I'd recommend this book."
2,He was unable to capture how a women feels,I found that the Author could not capture and hold me. There was something missing. The ending was to vague.....
2,too much of a good idea,I liked the beginning and the idea of this book. It just kept on and on and on. Like the EverReady Rabbit.
2,Ok,I think this book was a bit depressing. I began to think less of Delorse towords the end of the book. She seemed sneeky but alone. At the end though I relized she needed help and it made her a better person. I would not recomend this book though I didn't find it worth while reading.
4,A Must Read!,"I gave this 4*'s because it was a tad slow to start. But, it began to pick up very quickly. The way Wally Lamb decribes everything so realisticly - makes you want to crawl inside the pages and help Delores. I believe everyone has their opinions - but the 2 star review was very biased. Dysfunctional lives .. make you do dysfunctional things -- you tend to think dysfuntional as well. The more far fetched that things seem .. the closer they are reality. I feel this was an excellent book and deserves a reading."
5,A page turner!,I really enjoyed this book! I can't get into books about people whose lives are perfect and Wally Lamb writes about people that are REAL. People with problems. Definitely a great book to take on vacation since you won't be doing much else until you finish it.
4,intruiging but contraversial..in a good way,"She's Come Undone is a wonderful book about a young girl growing up into womanhood and all the troubles and hurdles she has to dodge to become the woman that she ends up being. It is a page turner with plots that you might not expect. Though some of the chapters are repititious and you know what to expect, the outcome is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone and anyone. Because it is a coming-of-age book, it is not the kind of book that you would see your mother reading back when you were a child. There are many contraversial topics for you to think about while reading the book and wondering what is going to happen next. There are characters in the book that you will love, and some that you will hate. During sad parts, you will cry, and during the happy ones, you will rejoice. Take your own journey into Dolores Price's life, and see what the world is really like."
4,An emotional rollercoaster,"I have two pages left, but I'm afraid something horrible will happen to Delores on the last one. The book has been incredibly difficult to read because I feel so much for her, but I have loved it all the way. Delores is as memorable as Holden Caulfield."
3,wally's secret insite,"Mr. Lamb ran the Creative Writing Center at my high school. His mantra? ""Write what you know..."" I have always had a hard time believing that he did not mooch some of the real life experiences that the 2000+ students who went through his Center,yearly, wrote about. My fellow classmates(we of the mid-late 80's) have agreed that Mr. Lamb must have had a pretty keen imagination to come up with all this material. I neither loved nor hated this book, I just have to wonder at the source origin"
3,Read 'til the end...,I kept reading and reading and waiting to see why this was a NY Times best seller. It wasn't until about the last 60 or so pages that it turned around for me and I started enjoying it. If you find yourself having a hard time getting through...keep on going. It gets better.
3,"A decent read, but doesn't hit pay dirt","It is intriguing that a male author chose to write about a character such as Dolores Price. In some moments of the book Dolores' thoughts are so much like mine, I had to remind myself that ""she"" was a creation of a ""he"". The book was a good read and I've since passed it along to a friend.My emotion throughout the book was that of anticipation. I kept waiting for the book to turn the corner and allow me to learn of Lamb's epiphanic reasons for telling me the life story of Dolores. It never happened. The book moved along slowly, occasionally stopping to slam her into yet another traumatic event.Wally Lamb keeps time in the book by throwing in references of pop culture and historic events. There is humor and sadness woven into several parts of the book, but all in all, I didn't get the feeling of satisfaction I would have liked. I kept reading diligently, but the payoff was minimal."
2,It got two stars because I could finish it,"Almost unreadable, but I managed to finish it. I hated the title character. Guess what? I too weigh 250 pounds, am happily married, hold down a great job, can fit into a VW bug, get into a car without it sagging to the ground and my arms look nothing like ham hocks. The author obviously hates overweight people (maybe I should write something about dumbo ears, since he sure has a set)."
2,Page-turner Nonetheless Disappointing,"Competent writing and a titilating premise (raped girl gets obese) crumble into an unrealistic ending.What is this - an infomercial for psychological therapy? Lamb creates a fascinating protagonist with a complicated life, then sends her to an unlikely cure. Life after mental institutionalization just ain't like this.It's a cinderella story with plenty of interesting details, but the denouement is an enormous let-down.Munching my way through this fat best-seller was like Dolores (the narrator) gorging herself on a whole, day-old cream cake... I couldn't stop myself, but when I got to the end I'd degraded myself for wasting time on it..."
1,Nothing Special,"Definitely one of the most overrated books I've ever read. Not a bad book, really, but I expected it to be a lighhearted story about a teenage girl coping with her family and her obesity. That's how it seems to be advertised, anyway. While I liked Dolores, she didn't come across as a lovable and unforgettable character. And I felt I didn't really get to know the other characters that well. Also, situations in the story just seem to happen out of the blue, and are over before I understood what was happening to Dolores. I had to re-read certain parts a couple of times to figure out what was happening. It does get more interesting towards the end, but not much more interesting. All in all, it's an okay book, but not the memorable pageturner I expected."
3,"Enjoyable to read, but trashy","I liked the fact that this book was an easy read, and I found myself not wanting to put it down. However, I can't believe anyone would say that this is the best book they've ever read. It's a good beach read, and not any better than a trashy soap opera. Dolores' character is not a believable one. Not one of us can say that we've never experienced trauma in our lives, but this was overdone. It was like, ""How many awful things can Wally Lamb make happen to one person in one book?"""
1,BAD,"I am apalled that so many people enjoyed reading about a person who had a rough childhood (but don't we all) and instead of overcoming and bettering herself just wallowed in self pity. She wasn't even a nice person. I felt no pity for her even though I tried. I did enjoy the begining and if she had done something with her life that was worth reading about after her tragedies I might have enjoyed it. Instead, It made me sick. Why do so many people feel sorry for this woman who is a liar to everyone, cruel to even those who do treat her good, and hasn't even deveolped enough backbone to not like the people that hurt her over and over again."
1,I'd give it 0 stars,"This guy can write, but what he wrote was trash. Thinly veiled lesbian pornography was the WORST. If you have any moral fiber I do not suggest you even open this book. I threw this one in the trash, so no-one else could be inadvertently offended because of my purchase. No more Oprah's Book club for me. Be careful who's advice you take on book reviews."
4,Entertaining,"This book is about a woman and her struggles through life, starting when she was around four years old and ending near her forties. I had a hard time trying to decide what to write for the review of this book. When I first started reading it, I was not impressed with the author's style of writing. It was hard for me to follow the time line of events and feel sympathy for the main character, Dolores Price. As the story went on, I began to get used to the author's style of writing, then I found myself very angry with Dolores and the decisions she made. Upon further speculation, I wondered, maybe her decisions affected me so much because I could relate to her in so many ways. I wanted to reach into the story, take Dolores and just shake her up, yell at her or somehow make her understand that she wasn't alone, that she had other choices she could make. By the end, I couldn't put the book down; I was so involved in the story and hoping that Dolores would find happiness."
1,Can you say depressing?,"I've never been one to stop reading a book after I've started it - I wish I had this one. This book was very interesting, yet depressing. I kept thinking it would get better, but......"
2,If this is the ONLY book in the bookstore... OK...,"It was a disappointment for me. After all the reviews I had read and everything I had come to expect from this book, it let me down. It was a book that I couldnt leave until I finished it, but it was WAY too long! It took me longer than many other books I've read to finish it. It is not enjoyable. If anything it is a depressing story. The main character Dolores lives through so much catastrophe that by the end of the book you start saying ""oh, no not a-gain!..."" It was interesting only in the respect that it was written by a male writer.In short, if you are left to choose... this shouldn't be the one you pick... If you don't have a choice and you have a lot of time on your hands.. well then ok... you should read it."
3,"If you want to be depressed, read this book.","The story line goes from bad to worse to horrible to unbelievably tragic. This book is extremely well-written but it's definitely a downer. I kept expecting things to get better for the heroine, but they never did."
2,Disappointed,"I heard friends rave about this book so I thought I'd better read it. To my surprise, I didn't enjoy it very much. The heroine is wild and I tried to like her; but she did some really outrageous things. I hope I don't meet anyone like her in my life. The writing is good; the plot is very far-fetched. When I finished the book, I felt like I had wasted my time reading it."
5,This is the best book I've ever read!,"She's Come Undone is the best book I've ever read. I burst into tears as soon as I finished it. Every woman should read this book -- we can all relate to Dolores on some level. A truly wonderful book, surprisingly written by a man."
4,This is truly a page turner!,"I loved this book, it fully held my attention and I wanted the outcome to be good for the characters. However, I must say that I did think that at some points the characters were more like caricatures. Granted this may be intentional on the part of the author, but I didn't care for that aspect of the book. The heroine, Dolores is not really a standard heroine as at some points you feel that she really is her own worst enemy, but it is because of this that the author successfully conveys her humanity to the reader. She is a poor broken soul looking for a peaceful life, whatever she considers to be enough just to keep her balanced. Finally, all I want to say is, read this book, it is a swift read because you DO want to find out what the eventual outcome will be!!!!"
5,I truly LOVED this book!,I had a very hard time putting this one down. The details and descriptions of the characters made me feel as if they were people that I knew. I found the story to be well written and it took me on an emotional roller coaster from the first page to the last. I would highly recommend this one!
4,She's Come Undone Audio Book,I read this book before I listened to the audio version. I was very disappointed in the audio version. They left out what I thought were important parts of the book. It seemed like pages and pages of information that would key you into how and why Dolores acted the way she did. The print version I thought was very good. Really descript in that you really felt what Dolores felt and almost could relate to what she was feeling. I would advise anyone interested in this book to read it and not listen to the audio version because they leave out a lot of information.
5,One of the best books of fiction in years,"I usually read an interesting book at one sitting, however, I kept putting this one down for the simple reason that I did not want to leave Delores' life."
4,"good, long read","It's been a while since I finished ""she's come undone"", & I came back to Amazon's page to see what people were saying about it...It's really interesting how everybody either says it's great or terrible, but almost everyone is very passionate about it. That says something about this book! I cannot say it's one of the best ever books I've read, but it kept me very absorbed, the same as ""I know this much is true"" by the same author. I think Wally Lamb is very talented, especially compared to a lot of authors writing today. All in all, I thought ""She's come undone"" was a good read, Dolores was an interesting, although a little exaggerated character, but in the end, this book didn't ""change my life"" so I can't understand why everyone is SO excited & even angry when writing about it. By the way, I think ""I know this much is true"" is also good, probably better."
4,4 stars 4 She's Come Undone,"She's Come Undone is an unforgetable book about one girl's incredible triumph over herself. Dolores' story is inspiring to any one who has come from a broken home, suffered a traumatic event, is depressed, or has overcome an obstacle in her life. It is easy to relate to and see a little bit of yourself in Dolores' insecurity and outlook on the world. I give this book four stars because it is an easy read and instills hope in the reader. After completing She's Come Undone, I felt energized and ready to handle whatever came my way because I knew if Dolores was able to overcome her hardships and get her life to be ""normal"", so could I."
5,I couldn't put it down,This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is upsetting and confusing at times but that is what makes it so good. Some parts certain people can relate to and certain parts some people can't. It has you intrigued forever. Read it 6 times...
3,Just OK.,"With all I'd heard about this book I figured I'd have to read it. In the end, it felt like any number of those things we plodded through in high school. It has some literary merit. I guess I'm glad I read it. But in the end it's not something I'd read again or recommend to friends."
5,The most incredible book I have read in a very long time,Wally Lamb has outdone himself in this magnificent book about a young woman striving for meaning in her life. The characters were so real and he did such a good job of writing from a woman's point of view that I found this book hard to put down at night.
3,Great reading but very painful and depressing.,"Couldn't put this one down..perhaps because I related to much to Dolores...If you have issues with addiction, this book can bring up a lot of stuff...very painful and depressing but also challenging in that it made me go back through my own pain and look at it."
3,Hard to like,"A co worker and I read this book at the same time, and while she said she could relate to the main character, I felt nothing but irritation for here until the very end, when she redeemed herself ( in my eyes) with Mr. Pucci. I think she deserved what Dante gave her, and all that moaning and groaning over her pregnancy with its implication that- If you have an abortion you will regret it the rest of your life and never get pregnant again- give me a break! However I will admit that I could not put the book down. I enjoyed the timeliness of the writing; all the references to specific TV shows made it seem like you were reading a freshly updated journal. I would recommend this book, but would warn that it's not a warm fuzzy novel."
2,Disappointing,"I was so disappointed that Oprah recommended this book, that I will never trust one of her choices again. I hoped to share this with my friends after I finished, but was too ashamed to admit that I actually lasted through the whole horrific story. Wally needs to write about what he really knows. He should not write about female sexuality nor how it feels to be a trampled woman. He doesn't have a clue."
2,Condition blunder,"Book arrived very quickly, but is not ""very good"" condition, which is what I paid for. Cover is bent, pages are yellowed and stained."
1,A Depressing Book,This was one of the most depressing books I've ever read. No one in their right mind would go through what the heroine of this book did. I hated it!
1,You're right...Oprah's come undone,"I was utterly sick when I finished with this book. I haven't felt this disturbed since I watched ""The Crying Game"" in college. Frankly, anyone who wishes to just stay in their own little homo-phobic world should ignore this book like the plague. I am a pretty open-minded person, but I was not prepared for many of the themes in this book. I feel like I was lured into reading something that I would have normally passed up just because Oprah liked it. After reading this book, I only felt like brushing my teeth to get rid of the bad taste in my mouth."
1,Watcb David Lean's 1946 version,I barely recognized Dickens' great story. Everything about this version was off. It was difficult watching Gillian Anderson's vapid portrayal of Miss Havisham; Herbert Pocket was a shell of his charming self; Mr. Wemmick is practically non-existent and his 'Aged P' makes no appearance whatsoever. It was depressing and dark.Don't waste your time with this version and rent David Lean's excellent and entertaining version. You might end up buying it and watching it over and over to see how what a gem it is.
5,12 month old bulldog has not left this toy alone since he got it.,"I bought the 14"" version of this ball for my 12 month old Alapaha Blue-Blood Bulldog pup. It arrived two days ago, and every minute the pup's been in the same room with it, he's been playing with it. He does try to get to the valve, but I think he has no hope. I put about a liter of water in it so it rolls all randomly, which drives him nuts. My older dogs don't care about it at all, but the puppy can not get enough. Highly recommended."
3,Not what I thought it was going to be...,"Based on the name of the product: Push-n-play, I thought the ball would have some give to it. It is very hard. I ordered 4, and kept the one ball I tried out with my dog (70lb black lab mix) and she will not use it. I sent the other 3 back. Maybe this would be a great ball for a dog that loved to chew on toys?"
2,much too heavy.,This ball was for my Border Collie mix who loves to push/roll balls around the yard with her front legs and chase them. This is very heavy and she has trouble pushing it with her nose when it gets stuck in a corner or behind an obstacle. I would not buy aother one of these. I wish it was a lighter weight material
3,good for big dogs,"I ordered this Push-n-Play Ball from Jolly Pet . It is heavy duty and good quality. I feel that I should have ordered a smaller size, as the 14"" version seems too heavy & large for continual play. My boxer acted frustrated while trying to push and manuver it around and quickly lost interest. I will order a smaller size to see if the results are the same. I also ordered the Jolly Pet Plastic Egg. She loves it !!!! I recommend it for anyone with a large, energetic dog. The Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Cosmos Dog Toy was also a GREAT toy, fun for night walks on our beach . I ordered Luna, because it glows in the dark... very cool."
1,Favorite toy ruined canine teeth,"Our German Shepherd absolutely loves this ball. He pushes it around and loves for us to throw it for him to chase and herd back to us. We noticed his mouth bleeding one day and discovered his tooth was bleeding. After taking him to the vet we learned that he hits his canine teeth on the hard ball when he steers it with his head with his mouth open(usually barking with delight). One tooth needs to be capped ($1,000) and the other is damaged. Sadly, I can no longer recommend this toy even though it is truly indestructible and the dog does love it. Canine teeth are definitely NOT indestructible."
3,Maybe a little lighter in weight,"My 8 month old shepperd played with it for 5 min but gave up because it was too heavy to push around for her. Three weeks now and still will not play with it unless I kick it first and oh by the way, wear shoes that are heavily padded."
3,Not a bad quality product,"The problem I had was getting my german shepherds to chase the ball. They only want balls that they can put in their mouths and bring back to me. If I could find a way to get them to cooperate, it would be well. As of now, this ball is not made to fetch."
4,"Jolly Pet 10"" Push n play ball",is a fantastic ball. I have a Melanois and that dogs are famous for destroy toys and specially balls and this one is great he just play until he gets exausted and that's exactly what I want and is not a money pocket killer because is hard matrial and he can not hold it with his mouth and destroy it. I love it and is perfect for big dogs.
2,Play ball for dogs,"This is not the product I thought I was ordering, and not as entertaining to dogs as the toy I thought I was purchasing (Jolly Ball, rubber with pull handle)"
3,Scary!,"Sure, it's incredibly durable and can be found in zoos around the world, but when a hundred pound american staffordshire is scared of it, it's not much of a toy, now is it? It really is only for rolling on the ground, as it makes a terrible sound if even try to bounce it (which it does not do). Why not get your dog an extra-large tennis ball instead?Pricey."
4,Excellent resource.,"This book is an excellent resource to use, but there are a lot of links that are not completed or are not available.I spent a lot of time going nowhere.Some data has changed and the material should be updated."
2,cuff is too small,the cuff is way too small and I don't have giganto arms. Not happy with the size of the cuff.
1,The Worst!,"It is truly amazing that this book exists! It is littered with mistakes, and it appears that a native speaker of English had no invovement in its creation. What's worse, the CD sounds like it was recorded in someone's garage.TOEFL test takers DO NOT BUY THIS TEXT! It has no connection to the TOEFL iBT test. Don't let the nice cover fool you, because this book isn't even worthy of one star.John Negishi, Tokyo"
2,...You Can Get It...,"..At The Box Store for $10..I Did Yesterday..1-14-11..My Only Complaint is they are double sided discs..Hate That...So i carefully made back up copies and put the master away..!...p/s You will find it in the $10 section not in a bin...Of Course You Will Then Have a 10 disc set, But the Master will stay scratch free..!..Good Huntin'"
3,3.5 Stars and a bit curious..,"Well this DVD set says it is the ENTIRE series so if it is then the price would be reasonable since the show ran for about 2-3 years.Very campy and aside from Tweeky being voiced by Warner great Mel Blanc he was a very annoying character..but I did enojoy the series even for all its campiness.And as a girl I was amazed by the costumes Princess Ardala wore, those took a lot of guts to wear...."
5,blast fromm the past!!!,bought this for myself...could't believe they had the whole series on disk....one of myy favorite shows when i was a kid
4,Satisfied customer,I was happy with this download. I would have prefered video in hand. I was pleased with the service I received.
5,Buck Rogers hurray!,I have always been a SciFi fan and Buck Rogers is the mainstay of SciFi in movies and TV since the 1930's. Gil Gerard carrys on the tradition of the 20th century american hero cast into an uncertain and perilous future wonderfully! The series is both entertaining and humorous and competely G rated for the kiddies as well! Loads of fun!
2,Painfully Craptacular!,"My wife and I grew up with Buck Rogers and had the fondest memories of this series. We sat down to watch the pilot episode and forced the kid to watch it with us. He was not impressed and we were amazed at how bad it really is. This did not stop us from finishing the pilot, but it is keeping us from continuing with the series. The show is so blatantly sexist and horribly campy that we were all heckling it from the opening sequence to the closing credits. The acting is terrible, the production value is worse and the dialogue sounds like it was thought up by middle school boys. We enjoyed our Buck Rogers evening together at the expense of the program rather than from any inherent value of the show. If I could give 2 1/2 stars I would. The show is awful in a MST3K way."
4,Nylabone Flexi Chew,"Our shelter dog did not play with any of the toys we bought her the first month she was with us. This Nylabone was just sitting on the floor for a month. Then all of a sudden, one day she decided to start chewing on it. Now it's a regular habit and she just loves chewing on her Nylabone. It sheds in a weird way and comes off in tiny little pieces. I like that - it's not big pieces that she could swallow and hurt herself with. Her tail wags the whole time she is chewing on it. I will have to replace it soon (it's been a month) since she has almost worn down the nubs."
2,Good for Dogs but,"My dogs like to chew but did not like them all that well. After one chocked on rawhide I was willing to try any thing, They do love elk antlers and do not chock them."
1,did not work with my watches,iI have Seiko kinetic and -Staihausen automatic. Winder did not work with my watches. Just wasted time and dollars.
1,An exercise in frustration....,"This grinder would tax a saint! It's almost free-wheeling when set on the fine grind, and one gets so little ground pepper for the labor expended twisting on the medium and course grind . It's too bad in that it is very pretty, fits comfortably in the hand, and matches the salt grinder that seems to work SOMEWHAT better. We were more than a little disappointed with this product.We had a grinder that we had bought in England in 1974 or 5. It was wood on the top and bottom; it had a heavy plastic mid-body that was scored so as not to slip, and was still the BEST pepper grinder EVER although it was looking a tad ratty. It just disappeared about three months ago, and we do not know the Mfg. of it!Can anyone help?"
2,Meh.,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes. However, these cookies are hard and dry. I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do. The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat. The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits. And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it: These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first. As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers."
1,"Caution, I was Glutened by MI-DEL Ginger Cookies",I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction. On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy. The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status. Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only. That way they can charge more for the product.
4,Good Oreo substitute,We know a lot about GF producs in my house and my son really likes these cookies. They are good Oreo substitutes. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cookie part is very hard and brittle.
3,Strong ginger flavor,"Recently diagnosed with celiac disease. Bought these at a grocery store, but the ginger flavor is very strong. The tecture is good, though."
3,BROKEN GINGER SNAPS,"REALLY ENJOY THE 'SNAPPY GINGER' TASTE IN MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE GINGER SNAPS.THIS CASE SEEMED TO ONLY HAVE ABOUT 5-8 WHOLE, IN TACT COOKIES IN EACH PACKAGE. THEY WERE MOSTLY GINGER SNAP CRUMBS!I HAVE ORDERED THESE GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES OFTEN AND THE MOSTLY CRUMBS WAS A FIRST. I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH OTHER MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES I HAVE ORDERED IN THE PAST.HAVEN'T DECIDED IF I WILL ORDER A CASE OF THEM AGAIN."
3,better than most model cars,"Easier than most cars to put together, but still had a few problems. didn't hold up long with my 8 year old hyper child."
1,Use Caution If Buying This Product,"My wife got a Mr. Coffee coffee maker for Christmas last year and needed to buy new filters. She looked in the store, but was appalled at the price so she looked it up here. This is the filter she found, and although it claims to fit her machine, there are slight differences in the outer plastic ring that make it incompatible with her machine. My advice would be to buy the actual filters here, but to buy a new assembly, if needed, at a store where you can compare it to your old unit. We basically paid $5.oo for a simple filter that can be bought here for less than a dollar."
3,"Works pretty good, but short life.","The product seems to do it's job correctly. I was good with it, except that it's recommended lifespan is about 1 month. I'm sure you can go a bit more if you take care of it and don't use it everyday. Also, the filter is not required, just recommended for use."
4,cleans the water,I don't ever recommend making coffee without a water filter. Tried it without and the coffee tastes nasty!! Definetly recommend getting getting the replacement filters as well. :O) Great product.
5,Coffee water filters,I was pleased to finally get these. I had needed a new one for awhile and will order more as needed.Thank You
3,I like this more than my 2yr old,"I thought my 2 yr old would love this....I thought wrong. I was very hopeful that this would keep his attention, but it does not, I will keep trying. My 9 yr old likes to build with it, but not for long."
4,Alpha's Magical Christmas,"In Alpha's Magical Christmas the powerrangers are of helping santa prepare for Christmas.So Alpha and Zordon are all alone for Christmas. Zordon's christmas present to Alpha is a Christmas tree. Then Alpha decided to telaport all the children from Anle grove there. Alpha and the children sing some christmas carols. Then it was time for the children to leave.Aboudt 30 seconds after the the children leaft there was an unanonced telaportation. It was Billy,Kimberly And Tommy! Then they song a christmas carol. This vhs is 30 minutes long. I would recamend this video for 8 and down. Its a really good Family movie."
3,Cheap headset Cheap performance,"This headset is not nearly as good as the Jabra I lost.The sound quality is okay but the volume does not turn onup high enough. It doesn't fit my ear very well, feelslike the headset will fall off. Also, I don't likethe instant connect feature. If you recieve or makea call, it automatically goes to the headset first."
3,not what I expected,"If you read Deadline and Dominion and are expecting something similar here...DON'T.This book is like nothing Alcorn has given us till now. Again, I am impressed with his versatility as an author. I did not go crazy over this book. I guess I was hoping for another truly phenomenal murder mystery.You will like this book if you liked The Chronicles of Narnia (C.S. Lewis) or even The Hobbit (J. R. R. Tolkien)."
3,Dissapointing,"The third (and final) season was clearly dissapointing. In twelve episodes the plot doesn't move forward to any significant degree.I won't go into details about various silliness that occurs. Bullock as the most one note character in television history. The Joanie/Jane relationship. The pointless acting troup (that does no acting). Hearst wandering around with impunity (by himself) for much of the season (unrealistic) and proceeding to open a door to a knocking stranger just hours after getting shot doing the same thing.Frankly, I kept waiting for something to happen and the final episode finished with, what amounts to, no progress in the story-line.Seasons 1/2 were gripping and well done. Deadwood could only have lost viewers as the language became sillier, the characters plotted like a bunch of high school kids and nothing of any importance happened.Sad to see Rome and Deadwood both go downhill after such wonderful starts."
4,"Excellent, but weakest of the three seasons","Any 'Deadwood' is better than virtually anything else on the television, but do not expect this 12-episode compilation from Season 3 to reach the heights of Seasons 1 and 2.Deadwood has matured. Mayhem that followed the creation of the frontier gold-rush town has settled into more a controlled, political-style mayhem. But there is still bloody mayhem, oh yes.But they needed less machination, and more Wu.No spoiler, but something of an assurance: The third season does not end on a cliffhanger, more or less. It has a kind of finish, although the makers obviously had a Season 4 in mind when they wrapped.For those new to 'Deadwood,' I am sure others have advised to watch the series in order, from Season 1. It is not a recommendation but a requirement. And give it several episodes to adjust your senses, so that you may appreciate a remarkable television achievement."
5,"This one truly broke new ground, even for the bold frontiers of cable television!","I'll state up front that I never did get used to the one word that got thrown around like water in this series but that was offset by so much that was good about Deadwood. For one thing, who would ever have thought a Western series would use language reminiscent of Shakespeare? The dialogue actually had me thinking about language and its power, pretty deep stuff for a show that depicted life in the late 1800s. Ian McShane, playing the heavy, was my absolute favorite in this series but other actors certainly were nearly as memorable- including a nearly unrecognizable Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, pulling out all the stops.I expect this series will remain a cult favorite and, in time, become even more of a collector's item. I doubt we'll see the combination of skillful dialogue, great characters and interesting plot developments - and in a Western, too!"
4,"Deadwood 3 - Off a little, but still the best around","If you loved seasons 1 and 2, you'll tolerate season 3 just to be back in Deadwood again. The sub plots wander around, sometimes seemingly uselessly, but the shows remain so thoroughly immersionable as to be worth every bit of the purchase price. If you own 1 & 2, buy 3. If not, you have my sympathy. JFS"
3,unsatisfied,"Enjoyed the series of Deadwood. But due to the manufacturing of the plastic DVD case. My first DVD disc was scratched, causing my movie to skip throughout. Made me very unhappy, also delivery took forever!"
5,Deadwood season three,This is a great HBO drama series. Language is not suitable for the young or easily offended. The story and characters are great and have inspired the wife and myself to purchase books about deadwood and the characters in the series. We may even visit modern day deadwood one day. If you can handle nasty language (as bad or worse than sopranos) this series will be a welcome adition to your video library.
5,My son is so happy!,I bought the next season for my son and he is delighted to be able to continue on without a hitch in his show time. As I've said before ...... with Amazon it is a cinch to obtain a whole season for your favorite TV show!
1,Not Worth the Time Suck,"As a fan of all of the Sookie books and someone who liked last season, I'm not feelin this season and quite frankly am bored with its reliance on shock value. It's disjointed, totally lacking the comic relief so well done in the books, and way off the book plot. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being great, I'd give it a 2. It's truly not worth the time suck."
1,whats going on?,"i have order true blood the complete second season since october, and i`m still waiting! there`s is no way to get in touch with the seller, and amazon does not provide in any way to contact this people. this is the second time that i get lousy service and begining to feel disappointed. can any one tell me what in the hell is going on?"
1,WTF????,"I'm confused, unless Amazon is in an alternate universe or beaming things from the future; but didn't the second season just start? I record them faithfully on my DVR and I only have 4 episodes so far, so how is it that the entire second season is already for sale? Is this just in anticipation of the seond season ending and they are taking orders for pre-sale?"
1,Don't BUY the Blue Ray- BAD CODING,If you have the patience for ten minute loading for each disc (more if you dare press any button) you're a better true blood fan than me. I don't know who came up with the concept of a True Blood bottle slowly draining but the vampire drinking doesn't seem remotely interested and frankly my patience isn't that good.Yes I love the story but damn this blue ray is from HELL!
3,Got too raunchy for me,I loved the True Blood show up until about Season 2.5. It just has gotten ridiculous. Will not be watching anymore of it.
4,Episode 10 of Season 2 - Things Go Bad,"""New World in My View"" is the tenth episode of season 2. Things are out getting out of control and characters are getting out of character, even for ""zombies"". No spoilers from me:Sookie and Eric return home to find MaryAnn firmly in control of just about everyone. As the synopsis indicates, Bill's easy answer just doesn't work. Lafayette tries to reach Tara and Jason provides comic relief.This was not my favorite episode, but it did move along at a fairly good pace.It is rated TVMA so it is not for younger viewers.CFH"
5,true blood / second season,"I would like to say a few things .I got this when the season ended 2009 . never opened it !so in 2011 i opened to find out that the first DVD was a blank ! over all Amazon was great by helping me out and giving me another DVD .so over all with me being on the phone for 45 min, the person who help me was great . the person who shipped the DVD was great .i have nothing bad to say at all ..thank youPaula"
5,Excellent Series,"I truly enjoy shows which stay as close to the books as possible. This series seems to do that very well. I also like the casting of characters. Great suspense, mystery, and love story. Very addictive."
5,Best series on TV,"Fast delivery I was able to watch all of season 2 before season 3 started, thanks!!"
1,Just Trash and nothing but trash,Want to see how white trash live and interact with each other.....The acting is as bad as the dialogue...
5,Love Sookie!,"After reading the series, I had to watch the tv series. Although it deviates some, it is still quite entertaining. I really enjoyed watching the entire series at my leisure...looking forward to getting Season 2 when available."
5,True Blood: Complete 2nd Season,This was just as good as season one. I enjoyed it. I'm going to purchase season three next. This is a very good series. I would highly recommend it.
3,Dvd problems,"I love the series. Already owned the first season then went and bought the second and third. The only reason I'm giving this a low rating is because there is a problem with the dvds. Our main dvd player is the 360, we kept getting a disk read error, tried the PS2 and the same thing happened. Tried the computer and it happened again. They will only work in our laptop, which is ok for us but a problem if we decide to let friends borrow them."
5,AWESOME,If you love True Blood you'll love this! The extra's are great and I love that I can watch them whenever.
5,Trueblood Awesome,This show is by far the most addicting vampire or other paranormal esque series i have seen. Twilight and some of the others are geared for teens this is a totally adult show and is very addicting. I cant afford HBO so i wait to see the series with each new release of a season.
2,Why the high prices per episode?,"I don't understand why people use Amazon.com to watch TV series b/c the prices are too high per episode. You can rent the same from N etflix for as little as $9 per month and download and watch unlimited movies and shows from your TV. It doesn't make good sense. If the prices were comparable to Netflix for the same thing, I'd use this service. I love Amazon.com for everything else, mp3's, durable goods etc, but this is just too expensive for me."
2,way over done,"Let me first start on the acting. average at best. The only person that you can say wow he is good actor would be eric. the series tries to shock you. Not sure how many times Sookie has almost died Well maybe 10 and that is not an exaggration. I would give the first seaon 3.5 stars but this season is almost joke. really dissapointed. Really expected more from HBO. loved the Wire, Sopranos, Six feet under . but this is crap!"
4,Light up your life!,"The Streamlight 33244 3C Propolymer Luxeon Flashlight is much, much brighter than the old style flashlight. It comes with a cord as well as a clip on the side that's useful for attaching the flash to a belt or a backpack. The bright yellow of the case makes it easy to spot. The only thing I don't like is the position of the on/off switch; It's a soft button at the rear end of the case. One has to hold the case in one hand and push the button with the other."
5,Perfect storage furniture piece!,My four-year-old loves this armoire! It was easy to put together and she uses it every day! I highly recommend this storage unit.
3,"A reader from Palo Alto, CA",Sounds good. A bit too verbose. The book's name is better than the conclusion. Nothing you would not expect if you watched enough violence movies.
4,only in english and region 1,This is on the disc itself and not the film yet. I should have waited for the version with the original french language. This disc is region 1 and has only english audio. Though it's in english I also prefer to hear the actor's actual voice in french and read the subtitles so the story feels more natural. I will post the actual story itself on my next updated review.
5,Challenges the inner spirit to persevere in creativity,"An inspiring book that reveals the ability of the man to recover and search for the truth of the real source of creativity. The best that a person can become when the real truth is revealed to the soul of a person. A life that becomes a leader among men in the face of all odds. Expressing the truth to the words, ""Nothing is impossible to him that believes"". It is a gret book and I give them as gifts to those that I feel have talents or abilities and don't seem to know how to use them."
2,What was all the hype??,"I read this was a great action thriller with a ton of suspense. It was terrible. I can't believe the Academy gives awards to flicks like this. I don't even recall seeing Jodie Foster or Anthony Perkins in any scenes either, what was that? Was Perkins pretending to be Delouise and was Foster Billy Zane or something. Ick! Anyway, terrible. I guess it's one of those ""art"" movies that are supposedly deep. I just thought it was stupid. The Hannibal sequel is much better and understandable! Stay away!! Don't believe the hype!!"
2,The last review,"I'm sorry, but the last review was hilarious. i hope it wasn't serious. this is obviously not ""The Silence od the Lambs"" this is just a horror movie spoof with very cheap and bad jokes. The reason i gave it 2 stars is because it's a horror movie spoof that came before ""Scary Movie"""
4,Fits good...,"They fit good but pinches sometimes, and even though I squeeze it to fit, it still turns around on my toe."
5,Great--A lot of fun!,"This is so much fun. Not only does my 4 y.o. love it but so does the whole neighborhood, including myself. It is awesome and sooo much fun. And very durable too!! One of the best buys we ever made!"
1,"Very poor story, not worth the money","Unfortunately, this movie fell well below my expectations. The story is ridiculous and contrived. There is minimal building done done by Bob and his crew, almost as if it was a side note. Spud the scarecrow and Scrambler are the main characters in this movie who are trying to find a golden hammer to give as a gift to Bob. The hammer was supposedly hidden by a pirate and they follow senseless clues found in pirate chests that they take from various locations without asking. I cannot find one redeeming thing to say about this movie. It is not educational and not particularly engaging. While I am a fan of the Bob the Builder series, this movie is lacking."
5,Pirates + Bob the Builder = Adorable!,"I admit I haven't actually watched this DVD yet with my boys, but I have heard it. I brought it in the car with us for our car DVD player and my boys love it! I have heard the movie over and over again and they laugh constantly. It first off is an actual Bob the Builder movie so it is long enough for kids to watch straight through (so you can get some housework done) or watch partly and turn it back on later. The movie is also different because unlike regular Bob the Builder episodes where he is building a particular project, this movie features pirates and a treasure chest! It of course features all the Bob the Builder great lessons, like teamwork, friendship, and critical thinking. My boys love it and the parts I have caught do look quite amazing and fun! I love the new animation and bright colors. Great movie for any child!"
4,Yoga Today-100 Years of Yoga in America,"""Our nature is happy. Our nature is peaceful."" Swami SatchidanandaThe Yoga Today documentary offers a comprehensive look at the world of yoga. It is a large topic, going far beyond just the physical benefits of the practice. This video shows some of the great masters in their element, some who are no longer with us. It has lovely scenery and very interesting shots of people practicing yoga and meditative movement."
3,Lacks quality,"This ice bucket is very pretty as a counter decoration but you can't use it for anything. It scratches very easily and if the inside gets damp, it rusts quickly and the finish peels off. There is a plastic liner but you and your guests have to be careful not to let water get under the liner - be sure to air dry it well after you wash it! I actually bought this to put next to my Kueriq coffee maker as a convenient place to store empty K-cups where they wouldn't show and I'd empty it at the end of the day, but within a few weeks, the bottom was rusted and the finish came off when I washed it...and it had some scratches near the handle on the lid...probably from people's fingernails as they lifted the lid to discard their used coffee pod. It wasn't meant to be used for pod disposal, I know, but even as pictured, the ice would melt down between the container and the liner and the same thing would happen. It is pretty as an unused counter decoration though."
2,Did not hold my interest,"Having read stories by J. McNaught, N. Roberts, K. Woodiwiss, Sue E. Phillips, S. McKenna and M. Cansham, I found the writing didn't flow and I had a hard time immersing myself into the story. I like to escape from reality when I read romance novels and this time reality was more appealing than the story...."
4,Good beginning for this series!,The Arrangement was a good story - maybe not quite as compelling as some I have read recently but still very good. I enjoyed Christina as a heroine and very much enjoyed David. He had so many many layers to his personality and it was a main part of the story watching them being pealed away - and wondering where his loyalites really lied. I am looking forward to the other books in this series.
3,"Good, but....","This was my first book by Madeline Hunter and I was plesantly suprised. The main characters were well developed and I enjoyed the time frame of the book. The plots were interesting, though it seemed like this almost could have been done as two books. There was a switch from one plot to another just about the middle of the book. Also, there was information that could have been slightly better presented or better explained, or maybe just left out, but I guess they were part of a previous story. (I personally hate it when authors do that. If you're going to talk about something that happened in another book, explain it well enough that I don't acutally have to read the other book to understand.)All in all, a reasonably good book and I would read from this author again.... maybe the book that is a precursor to this one..."
2,I could not finish this,"After reading the rave reviews on Amazon, I decided to buy this book. I started reading it and found myself not concentrating. I had an immediate dislike to the heroine. She was so mean to the hero and although he wasn't high on my list, I felt bad for him. The plot appeared to develop at a snail like pace. I made it to page 72 and could no longer read it anymore. I really wanted to like this book. I agree with another reviewer, perhaps the novel I read before had my standards set too high. My love for historicals is allowing me to give it a 2 though 1.5 would be more fitting. I may try this book later in the future.Oh. I forgot to add, the order in which you read these books is quirky. See her website for the order."
1,terrible,"Very wrongly titled. Change the name of the movie, and then it is a fair B movie. Has nothing to do with Immortals."
5,A nice surprise...,"Partland Brothers did a very nice job on that one.More the half of the songs on this album is a hit,in my opinion.It's a nice following of their debut album,Electric Honey.A little bit of rock,a little bit of 80's keyboard and a voice of it's own...Wow!I enjoy listening to it every time i put it on.One of my best song is ""Too Quick To Judge"".Good 80's rock suggestion for your CD collection."
5,All American a style book by Tommy Hilfiger,"The book was in great condition when I received it, just as the article said. I am very happy with amazon.com and my seller. The only thing is that the book took 6 days to get to me instead of 2 as stated, but I understand that the tragedy didn't make that very easy. The book is very interesting and has a great amount of information on Tommy Hilfiger that I was looking for to do a research paper. It is interesting and very informative to read. Thanks"
2,Don't be fooled by the finish shown here.,The photo leads you to believe you're buying a tray with an antiqued-copper finish. I wasn't hoping for copper - just the shown antique-copper finish. Instead I received a dark brown finish much closer to oil-rubbed bronze.
2,Not So Great,"This was not so great.Pros:The political intrigues were interesting.The clothing and sets were well done.Cons:The McGann brothers look so much alike that I couldn't tell that they were two different people until halfway through the movie. That was really confusing.For a movie about Catherine ""the Great,"" it didn't show anything about what made her great. The movie didn't portray the magnitude of the accomplishments she had and didn't show some of the most important ones.The writing seemed soap opera level. The characters had no depth at all. The movie started when Catherine was 15, then you start to see that she develops some political savvy. However, she seems to remain at the level of a novice throughout.I had high expectations. The film did not deliver."
4,"Perfect, except for the battery life","The best thing about the Sharp ViewCam camcorders -- all of them -- is that they allow you to record family events while still taking part in them. With the camera discreetly held at waist level rather than in front of your face, you can still be a part of the conversation. People find it less intimidating, too, so they tend to behave more naturally. You can also flip the LCD 180 degrees, and record yourself.The only downside is that the LCD sucks up batteries, so buy a spare set."
3,Shoes were a little uncomfortable,"I have always been a fan of Bandolino heels, however these fit more tight in the toe area than others I have owned. The material is not very flexible."
5,Don't believe you know your baby...,"because he just arrived to your armas with a HUGE, monumental genetic charge that comes down maybe from 20 or 30 generations back !Only this book can help us diving and delving into his tiny heart and just born mind..."
5,"aunque no lo creas, amiga mía","a las mamás sae nos escapan muchos detalles de la personalidad de nuestros hijos. Alegamos ser quienes mejor lo conocen...pero eso no siginifica que lo conozcamos BIEN, O MENOS POR COMPLETO.Y eso nos hace cometer errores y dejar sin pulir algunos dones y virtudes que puede tener la criaturita ( como sus inclinaciones de bailar, cantar, pintar o hacer sumas mentales cuando ya tienen más edad )Nunca está de más que nos echen una manita...Y este libro ME FASCINÓ PARA ESO !"
3,Not what it promises but interesting nonetheless,"My big disappointment with this DVD was that the interviews are spread over his entire career (a few from the last couple of years). Now if you want interviews only from the Ziggy period - as I did - look somewhere else. The interviews are from various stages of his life, and cover various albums.That said, it's a worthy addition to the collection of any Bowiephile. It's interesting to see different sides of him, and he is very entertaining to watch. So if you're keen on collected interviews that give more insight into the man and his work, you will enjoy this. I had seen some of these interviews online before, so be warned. I was really eager to see more of the Ziggy era specifically, which is why I dropped one star on my rating. The other star was dropped because as a DVD it's very sparse in layout and has no bonus features. It has a bit of a cheap feel, especially for the price."
4,"Love the series, this book is a great start to the story",Even though this is the second book it's a prequel and it does a good job of explaining a lot of the things the first book introduced without explaining thoroughly. Overall the series is good.
4,"size-correct, good shipping","Size was correct with good but a little slow shipping, however the shoes are what i wanted and couldn't find locally."
1,very poor quality - broke first time we used it,"The quality of the unit is very very poor - cheap materials and cheap construction. Expect it to break very easily which is what happened with us. We used it once on a mobile job and the handle broke off (cheap plastic). It also tips forward and falls on it's face a bit too easily. I guess that would make sense unless you put significantly heavier things in the bottom than in the top. We did like the overall design initially and the weight of the unit is very light. In our opinion the unit is best suited to sit in your garage where it is not going to be disturbed much. If you start rolling it around a lot or if you want to use it for mobile jobs, it will likely break and cause you frustration."
2,More of a reference guide to pipes throughout history...,"While this book is filled with fascinating drawings of strange and unusual pipes from around the world, it is certainly not one of those ""just sit down and read it from cover to cover type books."" Think more of an ""a to z"" dictionary of pipes. As a novice pipe smoker, I was hoping for something more informative on the actual mechanics of pipe smoking. I would highly recommend The Perfect Pipe by Jeffers or, if you can find a copy, Weber's guide to pipes and pipe smoking."
1,Totally out of date and of historic interest only,One of the very few books that I read and gave away. Why? This book is purely historic and does not even touch on the contemporary aspect of pipes.Facts about pipe smoking from ancient times would be of interest to historians.Not a book that I recommend.
5,Hope for the Flowers,"A sweet story about 2 caterpillars who decide to live life to the fullest. This book came highly recommended by my Spiritual Director who used the book to challege me to live a full and meaningful life and not get caught in the ""rat race"" or a status quo existence. The story is simple, with cute but meaningful illustrations. It is written so that a child could understand it although it carries an adult meaning. It was written in the 1970's and has a revolutionary undertone that is not so useful today, but it's message is still strong and relevant for today's seeker of truth."
5,An inspiring story for people of all ages.,"This book is one of the reasons why I made it through high school. It helped me focus on what was really important, love and friendship. It gave me hope that everyone could do the same."
4,"Lovely magical book, but WHY IS IT OVERPRICED HERE?","This book is necessary for everyone. I so highly recommend it to provide wisdom throughout the years of one's life, to refer to again and again.However, it only costs $12.95 at Trina Paulus' website, and in full-price retail stores. I don't understand why its 'discount' price is actually higher here.My recommendation: keep brick-and-mortar bookstores alive and buy it there, CHEAPER, and have it in your hands toot sweet.And do buy it, because it's just precious."
5,THE WORLD OF E.R.B.,"For any fan of Tarzan, John Carter of Mars, Venus series, Pellucidar, even Westerns, and many more, this biography of the creator of all of the above, is a must have and a must read!!! I discovered Tarzan and John Carter in the 60s when paperback editions were readily available. Add to that replays of old movies on TV (Tarzan - Johnny Weissmuller, Buster Crabbe, and the rest) and the creation of a fan was in the making. This reprint of the 1967 (The Big Swingers) makes this enthralling look at the life and times of Edgar Rice Burroughs available for the first time in too many years. Now, old and ""new"" fans alike can marvel at the fullness of this work. I can't praise it enough for allowing this ""older"" fan to relive the memories of cinema, television, and books that enchanted me as a youngster. For fans and followers, young and old, this book is an absolute essential for your library."
3,coffee cleaning tablets,"not sure if these make any difference but since the machine directions require them, and it was a very large investment, I figure I better go along for the ride."
4,So far so good,"Trying to find a reasonably priced non stick rice cooker. Used for couple of months, rice is good and no spill, the non stick coating holding up quite well. It will take longer to see if the non stick coating going to last."
