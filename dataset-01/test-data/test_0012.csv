4,Great story,"This book was a heart warming story. The characters are quirky, but you easily understand them. The author takes you on a journey that keeps you intrigued .It was easy reading and I could not put it down. I have now started reading poison wood bible by the same author because I like her writing style and story telling"
2,Bean Trees doesn't score high...,"I had been forced to read this book..and analyse it with great detail and this may add to why I think this book isn't a ""10"". My English class had to read this book and participate in seminars to find out what the beans represent and themes..Oh god! I feel it didn't give me hope or anything rather depressing because the issues of poverty, abuse and immigration only give the sense of hopelessness to the reader. Oh and the story was boring and really long."
3,La Dona holds it all!,"The plot of the film might be a little simple, and the movie itself is simple, but is actually Maria Felix the one who keeps you on your seat till the very end. Her beauty is truly shocking and I am sure (for what I saw) that she was better than most of hollywood stars and as better as the greatest stars (Taylor, Hepburn, Davis, Hayworth). I don`t think even Marlene Dietrich would have moved her eyebrowns is such suggestive and powerful way as Miss Felix have done.The very final close up is the one of her dead body, and, indeed she was the prettiest corpse I have ever seen!"
5,A Fun Read,"I did enjoy this little book, definitely worth the price I paid for it. It is very readable and inspiring. It has helped me decide to take better control of my own investments through learning to pick my own stocks instead of listening to what someone who will profit from my trade tells me to do."
4,Great history of investing,"Darvis stuff can be dowloaded on the web. OK for beginner investors for concept and idea's on investing, especialy if you travel. A bit dated in todays high speed information access on the web. I liked it anyway."
5,Flawless Perfection,"Flawless Perfection from start to finish!!!!! A must own for any Anime fan. All the characters are GREAT!!!!! Well done series , this is a really nice Box Set , Nicely Packaged , Top Quality Picture. Can't say enough about this series , just to bad it was only 1 season. These characters and this show would have been nice to have had around for a few Seasons. I was really impressed with this show. Gene Starwind and Jim and all the other characters are just awesome."
5,outlaw star rock,i love and like this movie really much but i don't have the movie i just watch it in the t.v. to bad they don't show this movie anymore. but i'm planning to buy the dvd because in my three years i always wanted this and i hpoe i get it soon because outlaw star is like the boom!
3,Another accidental find...,"This is a great book, quite reminiscent of Arthur Hailey's earlier works. Fast-paced and just scientific enough to make the reader feel scholarly without losing interest, this book offers a rare glimpse into the seething world of medical politics.The fast-paced action, played out in several ranges from political intrigue to bedroom frolicking to life-saving emergency surgery, keeps us on our toes as we follow a select group of doctors and exhibitors throughout the four-day annual convention of the Central Medical Association (a fictitious entity). Entire lives are altered within this very short time span. Loves and lives are won and lost.While it wasn't one of those books that you just can't put down, it was definitely one that I wanted to pick up again and again."
4,Jon rules,"Jon Bon Jovi proves he is multi talented. We know (or you should know) he's a fantastic singer and he demonstrates a pretty good acting ability in this vampire flick. In this movie,he is a white mans version of ""Blade"" as he seeks vampires to kill. Good cast of characters was assembled and a decent storyline."
1,power suck,"i didn't even see this movie and I know it sucks. All that I had to see was Bon Jovi and I threw the video to the ground as hard as i could muster at the video store where i was promptly kicked out. It was worth it though, it actually was offensive that such a thing could exist. The vampire genre could be so awesome and yet very few films live up to its potential. I guess it also lends itself to complete drivle such as ""Vampires - Los Muertos""."
1,0 STARS: Los Feces,"Jon Bon Jovi should definitely stick to singing because he's a horrible actor, but that does not even begin to describe how terrible ""Vampires- Los Muertos"" is...as horrible of an actor as Jon Bon Jovi may be, ""Vampires-Los Muertos"" is an even worse movie. Vampires, that's a laugh...this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse. The original ""Vampires"" sucked too, but this one is even worse folks! Definitely one of the worst so called ""horror"" movies of all-time and that my friends is saying something!! Can you believe some people call this a horror movie...well, you can imagine what I call it...yes sir, I just call it rubbish and that's being very kind."
1,"Very, very confusing","As a freshman taking 10th grade biology i do not like this book at all. It trys to cram way to much imformation into way too small a space, and the way it covers the topics is very hard to understand. It uses way to many words i don't understand and does not put them in the glossary. I have to use a dictionary to even understand the glossary. For example-""Mutation- A change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA; the ultimate source of genetic diversity.""I get, ""a change in..."" and then it loses me. I do not just hate science, or reading. Our school has a different book for class work and i understand that book perfectly. I like science and have enjoyed other books in the past, but this book is just plain dull and confusing. I would not recommend this book to people at my age."
1,Not for those just starting ms sql server or ms in general,"I was presented this book and told 'learn how to set up sql server'. Not from this. Aside from grammatical problems that make it hard to read, it presumes you know all the ms-isms, the microsoft way of naming or doing things (my 15+ years experience is on other systems). Of several dozen attempts to locate a term or item in the index, none were successful. Best guess; if you know an older sql server, or are well immersed in ms and its methodologies, this book might be useful to learn V7. If not, look elsewhere."
3,"Interesting, but a bit self-aggrandizing","I've seen only three of Waters' movies, which is plenty, and I enjoyed this documentary, but five stars? C'mon! It consists of clips from his movies, plus ""talking head"" interviews with a lot of unimportant (and self-important) people.Waters comes across as an intelligent and surprisingly normal guy, and it's interesting to learn how his moviemaking style evolved, but the constant references (by others) to his important role in moviemaking history is mostly bunk. The guy made crudely-produced gross-out movies. Nothing wrong with that, if that's what you wanna watch, but Fellini he ain't. Definitely worthwhile for hardcore Waters fans; of marginal interest to everyone else."
5,The Doe Boy,"My previously viewed DVD of ""The Doe Boy"" arrived promptly and played well. I was well pleased with the service and the quality."
3,Pretty good movie,This movie was pretty good.What's up with all the cussing though?It would have been better without all the profanity.
2,its ok,"I dont think this is a spoiler alert. If it is im sorry. I have been reading this series, Im like 7 or 8 books in now. There is a recurring theme in all these books, to the point that Im not even interested in them anymore.boy vows to never marry (or just marry for convienence sake)boy meets girlgirl is indifferent to boyboy and girl have a shared interest/mystery to solveboy decides to marry girlgirl is resistantboy and girl have lots of sex (pages and pages of sex)(i end up flipping ahead, its all the same really)boy and girl finally marry and live happily ever afterAnd so far it always seems that girl runs straight into boy somehow. that seems to be how they all meet."
2,"So So Romance, but Really Really Slow...","I enjoyed the character of 'Vane' in Devil's Bride and decided to pick up the book with Vane's story. Although he is still very bit as attractive, he somehow lacked the excitment of a hero in this story. I failed to understand how the two of them felt in love. The relationship between the hero and heroine were not well developed leaving me only understanding the lust between the two.The story moved so so slowly starting from the middle. It was truely painful to get through. The thiefs sub-plot was not exciting in any way and the mystery not well developed in the book. I only finished the book because I bought it and refuse to waste money/book."
3,A good read but not as good as Devil's Bride.,"I enjoyed the book but found it to drag more than I liked. I was expecting more along the lines of Devil's bride. I wished Patience had more spunk and less ""patience."" I don't, however, think the book a waste of time and certainly will read the next in the Cynster series."
1,Over-rated and confusing layout,"When I bought the book there wasn't much around at the time. Wanting to learn Visual InterDev I got this one only to discover that you needed to know InterDev before you read it. The book tells you what InterDev does and dosn't explain why, nor does it give you any real working examples. The book also repeats itself too much. You will also need to learn ASP before you read this one. However, most of it uses InterDev scripting modules, which gets a database up and running quickly- useful but not when it comes to ASP programming.I wish I got InterDev Unleashed. I wasted my money on this one."
1,Disappointing,This should have been a good book but wasn't. The Installation instructions refers to directories that don't exist on the CD. The CD provides a Access database that can't be used. I even talked to Visual Interdev technicians at Microsoft and they couldn't make it work. Chapters on integration with the Option Pack are really thin. Instructions assume that you know a lot.
5,She's the best!,"I have all of Maida Heatter's cook books. This one, in essence, is a collection of some of her best recipes. You can't go wrong when you follow her easy, fool-proof instructions. The techniques she has taught me over the years helps me with other, less informative, cook book authors. Her precise instructions give you total confidence in the results. My favorites, which I have made many times are the East 62nd Street Lemon Cake, the Queen Mother's Cake, and the Sour Cream Cake (which is unbelievably delicious). She is always the one that I return to."
1,Poorly crafted leggings.,My wife wore them once and the seam in the seat began to unravel. I also got her pair from Newport News that were of much sturdier construction. I would recommend going with those instead of these.
2,tights,"I returned these - too loose... Have a hard time finding tall, slim sizes. Fabric seemed to be an ok weight, though I don't know how they would have worn since I didn't keep them. Had to wait a few weeks for the return credit."
3,Comfortable leggings,"I bought these tights to wear to yoga class, which is an air conditioned space.They are easy to put on, long enough for my 5' 6' body, did not lose color on washing ( 2 times so far),and opaque enough to hide underpants. I liked the higher rise ( vs the new lower rise style). I did want a slightly tighter ( maybe more spandax) and also heavier tights and that is why I gave them 3 stars. However these are fine and if they continue to hold up I will wear them during the colder weather with skirts."
1,Dog Poop with a diamond in the middle,"Great marketing tactic. Put 1 good song (Sgt. MacKenzie) on an album and fill the rest of it with garbage that couldn't sell by itself and then make all the tracks ""Album Only"" so you'll have to buy the whole album! Lousy tracks, coming around on ""The Widowing Fields"", somewhat decent. Bought album only for ""Sgt. MacKenzie"" since you can't it anywhere else."
1,Not a Soundtrack,"Though the collection of music on this CD is great (some), it is not a Soundtrack of the movie. If one reads the title carefully (which I did not because it is not visable on-line), the music is from the movie (little), but mostly ""Inspired"" by the movie. Huge difference. I was disappointed that I did not receive what I thought I was purchasing. Including the word ""Soundtrack"" on this CD is misleading."
1,TERRIBLE!!! These 'songs' are completely inappropriate,"NONE of these songs appeared in the movie. NONE of these songs have a THING to do with the movie ""WE WERE SOLDIERS"". Thank god I checked Amazon before I bought this piece of junk. Where's the score, from composer Nick Glennie-Smith????"
2,disapointed,I wanted the sound track from the movie the way the music was on the movie.not somthing eles that was not in the movie.
1,We Were Soldiers (Music From and Inspired By),"I was very disappointed with this CD, as there were only 2/3 songs from the soundtrack. Your add implied it was the Soundtrack and it clearly isn't. The original music was breathtaking and this wasn't. Sue"
2,Excellent movie but very poor soundtrack album,The movie is one of the best Vietnam era movies I have seen but this soundtrack had only 2 songs on it that I recalled being in the movie. I wish I had saved my money and stuck with the movie instead of paying also for the soundtrack.
2,"Sountrack, ""We Were Soldiers""","I wish I could provide a stellar review of this soundtrack; the problem is, it's not the soundtrack from the film ""We Were Soldiers"". The only similarity between this and the wonderful music selections and performances of the film are in two cuts: ""Sgt. MacKenzie"" (you know, the ""lay me doon on the cold, cold groond"" song); which is, admittedly, some great music by Joseph MacKenzie. And of course, the US Military Academy Glee Club and Metro Voices ""Mansions of The Lord"", so beautiful and fitting that it was chosen to be played at the late President Reagan's funeral. This cut alone was worth the purchase price of the CD. But I wish I'd parted with the $.99 to just download these cuts, and skipped the rest..."
4,Good Read,"This book taught me a lot about blind children. The basic plot was interesting, but was not developed very much. The book focused more on the relationships of the characters in the book than on the mystery. Overall, I would recommend it to readers who do not get impatient if there is not a lot of action. Otherwise, people might find this book boring."
4,good book,"this is a good introductory book about food combining. i read it before reading kathryn marsden's one and that is my fave. if you want to dabble in combining this is great. some aspects are confusing and you just have to draw your own conclusions. and its british, so its fun to read the little idiomatic expressions. i walk around calling it an 'avocado pear' now and my husband thinks i'm crazy-in a good way."
1,Bad player. Zerro reliability.,"I bougth this player almost one year ago. From the first minute I was dissapointed by the sound quality. Compares with old cassette player (not even with the worst cd player). Battery average life was under 10 hours.Doesn't connect directly to USB (had to carry always with me the cable huge connector).Documentation is poor. It took me over 2 months of web research to find out how to create playlists (you sinply transfer the .m3u files to the root of the audible folder).Finally after 10 months the player is broken. After a media transfer with my pc it was never stopped updating the storage so the only sollution was to take out the battery. After restart the player was FROZEN with the last song played before the media transfer and the battery level on red (no control working, not even the power button).I wrote to the sandisk support twice (they never responded to the phone either).Buying again from SanDisk? NEVER!!!"
2,Don't waste your time / money,"I bought this thing thinking it had good features for the $99 price tag. I used it for a few days and it is a piece of junk.The construction is very weak, the dial is lose, the sound quality is not that great (not horrible though) and my biggest problem is it doesn't sort the songs by the track number in the ID3 tags.I emailed support about this and they were very rude and rather than answering my questions about the sorting, they suggested I return it if I'm not happy with it.The only reason I didn't rate this one star is 'cause the player has FM radio, which I kind of liked.Anyway, I returned the C140 and got an Ipod Nano... It's $50 more, but WAAAAAAAY better.Just my two cents. ;)"
2,anything but an ipod,"i got this b/c i was desperate for an ipod alternative, and it seemed to be a decent buy. my main complaint is that every few days it refuses to play songs that i've downloaded onto it from yahoo music player (it will still play songs i've transferred from CDs). when it does this it asks me to ""plz sync the device"". i still haven't figured out what that means. sometimes if i plug the device into my computer and alter the playlist a little, it's happy for another few days. sometimes this doesn't work. very frustrating. also, it operates on AAA batteries and sucks them down like water."
3,"Nice player, but won't play Audible files","I liked the c140, especially its clear display, but it won't play Audible's audio books, as advertised. I tried two players (I returned the first for replacement, since SanDisk thought it was defective). Audible's books could be transferred to the players,albeit very slowly, and they usually appeared on the units' displays, but they couldn't be played."
4,Excellent Study Guide for MCSE Certification,"Need to get certified? Read this book! The book presents all the material needed to pass the TCP/IP exam! The text covers the TCP/IP protocol suite, WINS, DNS, DHCP, SNMP, MS Browsing, utilities, and name resolution. The only weak section of the text is DNS. The DNS chapter needs some revision, but if you read the RFC's and MS's white paper on DNS you'll be set for the exam! This book would also be a great reference if you are studying for the MS Networking Essentials exam."
5,excellent,"despite the obvious grammar error, sentence 2 on page 1 of the intro, this book got me a 966/1000 on the tcp/ip exam. it is clearly written, and very comprehensible with interactive review sessions. TCP/IP was a grand riddle to me, now I know it better than my wife ... well, no!"
5,Most Beautiful Book in My [very large] Collection,"This is ""the"" book for the serious needleworker. It has the most comprehensive technique instructions of any book, ever, for gold work, painted canvas, and shading; it isn't a cutesy book of simple projects. The illustrations are excellent. The color photos are to die for: closeups of step-by-step work in progress and examples of finished work will enable you to strive for excellence in your own work. This is a teaching book with important information about threads, fabrics, frames, tools, framing up, tips ... the list goes on and on. I can't recommend this book any higher."
3,for shame!,"This superlative, modern translation, of a genuine classic of English literature would be second to none but for one unfortunate consideration; the print quality is awful. The faded, inconsistent, nearly illegible type in this book is an affront to its contents. It really is a desecration by a publisher who should have more respect, and self-respect."
4,journey to God,"For people interested in contemplative prayer, this is an illustrative, readable bookthat prepares you for your journey. It has tips on the contemplative life as well asauthentic Church doctrine. Contemplative prayer is given clear descriptions andthe work is conveniently broken down into short chapters. It's also cross referencedwith another great master work-The Dark Night of the Soul by St.John of the Cross."
1,You'll love Python,"I debated whether I should write seven pages, footnoted, indexed, and full of examples on why you should not buy this book and choose to seek another source for learning Python. But if you're the type who would actually make it through all that to get to the main point, you might actually LIKE ""Learning Python"". I'd rather save you, the save-able, from experiencing the same pain that I am going through right now. So here is my one-word review: ""Excruciating"". I hope this has been helpful. By the way, Python is fantastic and is ironically everything that this book is not."
5,Learning Python (Help for Programmers),"An EXCEPTIONAL introductory learning manual. My programming background is strictly mainframe Cobol (15 years). I have never coded in C, C++, OOP, or any other open-source language. I have found this book to be very easy to read, to understand, and to utilize in coding new applications. Even though Python is currently in release 2.2, this release 1.5 version of Learning Python is still 100% applicable.If you are learning Python: YOU NEED THIS BOOK !!"
1,Simply dreadful,Having previously read several O'reilly Perl books I thought that learning Python from this text would be straight forward. Unfortunately this book has none of the helpful examples that the Perl books have and also dissappointing was the reluctance to write the code as you might using a text editor. Instead the authors seem to prefer to write code as it would be run from the interpreter on the commandline. This made it really hard to write any Python using the text editor. All in all a complete waste of money.
3,"Interesting, but....","The best ""review"" of this film is found on the DVD casing itself, which includes filmmaker Nikolas Schreck's 2002 concession that, since having made the film in the late 1980s, ""I have learned much more concerning the actual facts of the Manson murders than I knew when this film was made. In light of this more accurate information, it is obvious to me that I presented several wrong conclusions in 'Charles Manson Superstar.' Were I to make this film now, I would have asked Manson very different questions than I did at the time. For example, I have heard credible evidence that indicates that Manson may well have been present at the scene of the murders and may have been far more involved in the crimes themselves than even his most vociferous critics have claimed. Therefore, I no longer believe that Manson was the innocent martyr he presented himself to be."""
2,"Buchanan, you should wait for others eight years","Buchanan should wait for others eight years rather than producing a similar flat bucket of songs. I was a fan of his first album and I recentely bought it again on LP format too. The second, HAT, is another great record and on the third album PEACE AT LAST there are three songs among the best ever, Happiness, Family Life and Soon. But this work is not a heir of the previous three ones, because it doesn't have any that takes your breath away, nothing to amaze you. I'm very very sorry."
1,Perfect example of fallacious assertions,I chose the YouTube video about this book to show my college class on Ancient Humanities. The assignment was to write down the statements made in the video that do not stand up to scientific scrutiny. This book and its video are a perfect goldmine of alluringly presented but totally fallacious assertions.
3,Proofing Needed for Kindle Edition,There are a LOT of errors in the Kindle edition - and I have not even gotten past the introduction. Many words are split in two and one sentence made no sense - apparently words were left out or misunderstood by the software. It needs some serious proof-reading!!
2,Pseudo-science wrapped in Christianity,"The author is respected in the field of mathematics, and that is well and good, but his objectivity (and argument) is tainted in his bid to conform history into his narrow Christian viewpoint.Fomenko doesn't stop to consider that Christian mythos borrows heavily from other religions and events... rather, he wants us to believe that all of these events and writings are based on the life of Jesus Christ! (And he, in these works, is not from ancient Palestine, but Russia!)This book is an interesting Christian curio, with tainted science aspects. Historians, Egyptologists and serious scholars would do well to spend their book budgets elsewhere."
2,Reads like a doctoral thesis,"I really tried to read it. I wanted to read it. The topic interests me. But I just wasn't prepared to read a 624 page doctoral thesis, which is what it reads like. Too many charts, references, etc. And yes, I am intelligent enough to bore my way through that stuff, but I had planned to read this for enjoyment. Not gonna happen."
1,absolute garbage,"this book is absolute garbage. the author has no concept of history and completely disregards the archaeological and historical record. If you you want to know more about ancient history, go to the experts. heck, even Livy is better than this guy!"
4,wonderful movie,i watched this movie as a boy and enjoyed it. it was fun and wonderful to watch. the caterpillars in the movie are exciting but when the two rodans are unleashed the fun begins. effective special effects and a real sympathetic and environmental end. a must see.
4,Classic Kaiju,"Now, This flm, Rodan was the first movie to consist of the famous Rodan monster. and was also the first Toho Kaiju (Giant Monster) film to feature Color Video.Rodan all begins when several miners are found dead, and then suddenly GIANT FREAKY monsters appear in the town, this all leads up to the hatching of Rodan, the giant prehistoric flying dinosaur, that is so big, when it flaps its wings it is propeled forward so fast it creates a sonic boom.The film itself features a lot of human dialog, and there are not many Monster VS Monster battles, but we do get to see some interesting destruction scenes.Without spoling anyone I would say that the ending was sort of cheap.Overall would I sugguest Rodan to people? Yes, but not as much casual fans as fans deeper into the Giant Monster stuff. But if you like classics, and think you would like like a Giant Prehistoric bird flying around killing planes and sonic booming cities, then you probably will like this film"
4,ROdan the MAn,There are two Rodans terrorizing tokyo.There jet fast flying ability and there hurricane effect really level tokyo.Its a good flick And i know the spx was not all that and the spx were quite lame but its RODAN.The storyline was pretty good and the action was done very nice.Ther reason I didn't rate it a 5 because it was missing something to it.Somehow The original godzilla had something to it then this.But overal you need to get this its a good kajiu film.
1,"purchased from Amazon, old spoiled bottle",Received from Amazon Old faded package dark spoiled perfume bad smell as spoiled expiredAmazon promptly issued refund
3,Northern Lights,I usually love anything Robson Green is in. I found this series not up to his usual efforts. The story just didn't interest me. I found it kind of dull and uninteresting. Robson Green and the cast did very well with the material they were given but I would not watch it again. Other people who have seen it have obviously like it very much. For me it was just so-so.
4,they exactly they are,They are what they are. Great work pants. Just wash them a few times to soften them up. And they will be comfortable.
1,very disappointed,The pants I received look nothing like the picture. I was looking for a nice pair of jeans for my husband and picture was just what I wanted. When they arrived I was very disappointed. The stitching is white which maks the pants look really cheap. Most of the reviews indicate they are nice work pants and they might be but they're not what I expected. I am definitely returning :o(
2,Life After the Weak-minded.,"Anthropocentric fairytales and simple moral fables.He writes well however. He'd produce very good sci-fi if he got over his,""Oh there must be some deeper meaning to human existance""Actually no there isn't, get over yourself and your inflated species ego Coupland."
4,Breathtaking Ending,"Read it in one sitting. The ""book"" format gives it a sweet, minimalist air. Yes, it's not the most insightful thing he's written, and I am getting tired of his apocalypse fettish. But the final sequence is one of the most beautiful, light-handed pieces of spiritual writing I've ever seen. I love all of Coupland's work, but this one lodged at a deeper place in my heart."
5,Still Thrilling To Recall Coincidences,"I remember how ""taken"" I was that I'd purchased this book while visiting in Prince George, B.C., only to discover the first story dealt with a man who had just travelled there.One of the reasons so many appreciate Coupland's art, is that he seems to have intersected our lives with his own. I heard him read in Victoria, B.C., and although he is uncomfortable at the podium, his message has ""the prophetic"" about it...and I hope he will continue to exmaine ""us"" and ""himself"" in that light (just as this fine collection does)."
4,Been there...,"This is a good book in the Coupland ouvre... well worth reading as it includes, like the rest of his writings, poignant insights. He does well to put words to thoughts and feelings that may be difficult for others to do so. It was kind of depressing in some instances, but hey, that's life"
5,Brings back very fond memories,"I had, and loved, this book as a child. I just bought it to give to my god-daughter. Hadn't seen it in years. Sweet and heartwarming. Brought a smile to my face."
1,Mean-spirited biography,"This mean-spirited biography does nothing to help a reader gain insight into this remarkable English poet. The author leaves great gaps in her examination of Byron's life and what she does relate (i.e., about his illfated marriage) is biased and gives absolutely no sense of the personalities involved or a sense of regency England. Her reaction to Byron is hostile throughout (without being at the same time incisive), making me wonder why she decided to write about him in the first place. Give this one a pass and look for Leslie Marchand's biography which ranks among the finest or read Byron's complete correspondence which gives one a direct view into his personality."
5,Available under another title,"For those who are unaware, this book is also available under the title 'Murder in the Mews'"
2,Hackneyed magic realism,"Hackneyed magic realism - kitsch and cliche.The cover of this edition features a quote from Marquez:""...unmistakeable reading pleasure.""Surely the complete quote must be something along the lines of:""Even Stefan Zweig, in comparison, inspires unmistakeable reading pleasure.""Read The Lizard's Tail by Valenzuela or Ship of Fools by Peri Rossi instead. Leopard in the Sun is unmistakeably dispensable."
2,"Can be interesting, but don't believe the title","This book is subtitled ""Master Next Generation Web Database Techniques"", so you might be forgiven for thinking that it has something to do with the web, or HTML, or distributed computing. No such luck.What you really get is mostly a collection of annotated source code listings for a simple SQL interpreter and database using plain text files, padded out with one or two chapters of introduction to SQL and JDBC. If you are interested in how an SQL database might be written, or you want to provide an SQL/JDBC interface to some plain text files then it could still be a ueful book, but I can't give a good review to any book which so wildly misrepresents itself."
3,A Mother's Memoir About Her Son's Juvenile Delinquency,"This book is a mother's account of her son's juvenile delinquency and conduct disorder. She tells her story from an existential and sociocultural perspective. The writing is quite poetic at times.Though Stephen is into guns, gangs, theft and other crimes, the author views all this as an incongruency of Stephen and society, eg. he just can't adjust.I felt like the author needed parenting classes. The writing is lovely but the content irked me. Where is accountability and responsibility? Diggs talks about fairness between her and Stephen. I was more concerned about fairness to Stephen's victims."
1,Don't try this at home,"The silly grins of non-judgmental Rogerian acceptance and thrill-seeking. A theory that two messed-up childhoods brought together might find an acceptable lifestyle due to the extreme need for affiliation that afflicts children within a wierd isolated anti-society. This book echoes every myth of the ""recovery"" movement, but it lacks footnotes, specific attributions to source literature, and a thorough explication of opposing views. Buy this book to join the ""pity party"". What a thrill for ""professional educators"" who, with career tenure, can get away with doing such destructive antisocial things to children. Includes convincing anecdotes that show why some psychotherapists should be debarred."
4,School Book,Used this book during an Education Class for a Pre-School Practium. Its a great book for that age group.
4,"It's no Danielle Steele, but you'll pass the test!","Succeeds in breaking down complex subjects like STP and 5500 aggregate switching backplanes in ways that I can understand. Well written. The author does a good job in bringing to life a subject that is about as interesting as Al Gore. Would have gotten five stars, but they skimp on 5500 bus architecture just a little. It's the only book you'll need!"
2,Cisco book by ROSSI,"I read this book but did not find it very interesting. Though the Rossi has attempted to do a good job, it reads more like a manual. Also a lot of cut and paste pictures of the switches. I would suggest additional reading material besides this book"
4,It was essential to passing the actual exam,"This is a good book if you have been working with Win98 and networks (especially Novell) for some time and your ready to take the Win98 Exam. It had some good questions that I hadn't seen before. The CD included in the book had a great test, but lacked the simulations I faced on the real test. Nevertheless, I think it was a good buy."
3,It's So-So,"For a Godzilla movie, this movie didn't do much for me. First thing that got me about this movie was that Godzilla doesn't come on at all until the end of the movie. Most of the time it is Titanisaurus, a new monster, causes the havoc in Japan. This is the only Godzilla movie I can think of that doesn't have much of Godzilla in it. It didn't make sense to start the movie off with a fight between Godzilla and Mechagodzilla but I suppose it was giving you some Godzilla at the start so you wouldn't notice his absence through out the rest of the movie. I understand that technically this is not a ""Godzilla"" movie but more of a ""Mechagodzilla"" movie, but what good is Mechagodzilla without the big G fighting him the entire movie. Overall, its okay, it's not that bad. But the thought of no Godzilla much kind of brings the movie down to where if they did have the G in more, it would have been a lot better. So watch it, but don't expect too much"
1,The Chosen- BAD! BORING!,"This book was uninteresting. It was boring and uneventful. I felt it had a lot of unneccessary details that made the book even more unexciting and slow. The book had no meaning to me and I felt the ending was horrible. The author made led you believe that something would happen at the end because the rest of the book was not eventful. Instead, he just let everything go together! BORING!"
4,Excellent Book for open-minded people...,"I have recently read the book, The Chosen, by Chaim Potok. I found this book to be very entertaining and informing. I learned about Judaism and the Jewish culture. This book helps you to realize how valuable a friend is. It tells of how friends can help you through life and have fun as well. I also learned a lot of things about the Jewish religion. I would recommend this book to people that are open-minded. You have to be willing to learn about different customs in order to enjoy this book. Also you must look beyond the text of the book into the meaning. This is a deep and powerful book. I hope you decide to read this, and enjoy it!!!"
3,A novel that captures how a father-son relationship can be!,"The Chosen is an astonishing novel that describes how a father-son relationship can be important in life. This novel reminds me of a book I read in school called A River Runs Through It but this book has sort of a different twist. I feel that you learn a lot knowing how much pressure the main character Reuven had to go through with his father's health problem and a weird relationship between his new friend Danny and his estranged father. Also, how both fathers emphasize on studying their religion Talmud can be to their future career. Although this book is truly exceptional, sometimes I find it difficult to understand their Jewish history and religion. But overall, I would recommend anyone to read this novel because it's an impressive story you won't forget."
5,"""The Chosen"" is an extraodinary book.","I recommend ""The Chosen"" to all, Jewish or non-Jewish. I myself am not Jewish, but the material discussed, though rooted in Jewish religion, pertains to all. This story is about a boy who learns about life through his father, his religion, and through his best friend, whom he first thought of as an enemy. I couldn't put this book down once I started it. After reading it, you feel as though you have experienced it. Chaim Potok is a very talented author whose words read like a movie. I recommend this book for anyone who's seeking a good story!"
2,So boring...,"I have heard for years how good this book is. It never looked particularly interesting to me personally, so I put it off and put it off. I finally got around to picking up a copy, and was pleasantly surprised for the first 75 pages or so. It did engage me. And then...what I expected: the author began to describe the tedious nuances of the slightly-different faiths in excruciating detail. I just didn't care. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs hoping to get back to the storyline. Eventually, I just threw in the towel. Judging from all the positive reviews here on Amazon, and from friends and coworkers, I trust that there is something worthwhile here. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it. So, take the advice that makes sense for you. You know yourself better than most, right? I should have trusted my own instincts. But, sometimes we're wrong, right? Might be worth picking up at the library first. If you can make it to the end, more power to you..."
4,"""The Chosen"" review","The Chosen was a very interesting book. I rated it as a four star, because the flow of the book was great. A main point that stuck out to me was when Danny had caused the accident with Reuven. This was interesting because it caused the theme of friendship. It had brought the two of these people together and they both had realized ""forgiveness"" was a key role. I enjoyed this book, and i have read several books, and this was most likely one of my favorites. This is because it had many themes that had a major impact on how the characters acted. one example is how the Jewish religion had affected Danny's life of studying the Talmud all the time and not having many activities going on in his life."
5,The touching story of two boys maturing in separate worlds,"This book is my second all-time favorite book! (George Orwell's 1984 is my favorite.) This should be read by anyone, especially people exposed to much diversity. Throughout the masterpiece, I would think in my mind what I thought would be the most effective cont nuation of the story from whereever I was, and I would say 99 times out of 100 (No exageration!) the book took the course that I thouught would be most effective. If you are looking for other books that empathize with the Jews, try EXODUS by Leon Uris. While EXODUS is not as good, it really gets you wrapped up in the story. READ THIS BOOK!"
3,A good book,"The Chosen was a good book. I chose it out of a list for school, then found it to be better than I had hoped. Since I normally don't read books that have to do with real life problems, this is quite a compliment. It is a book of great hate, and the will to overcome it, even without knowledge of Orthadox Judaism, I still could figure out what was going on :)"
3,It's ok,"At first you think it'll be boring about religion. Then you see it's about baseball. Then it's about school. No where did neo come into the story. It's good for a summer read while on a chair. That's about it. I did a presentation on this, chapter 8. I got an A+."
4,Sort of Leaves You Hanging,"All in all this product does what it says it does. I was a bit suprised at the flimsy construction considering it is being used to hang clothes. It has not fallen off the wall, cracked in to little pieces or allowed my clothes to fall to the ground...YET"
5,Just what we were looking for from Amazon!,"We remodeled our laundry room area and wanted a place to hang shirts as we took them out of the dryer, but didn't want a full length rod. The Instahanger works perfectly! I ordered two: one for hanging clothes and the other for storing unused hangers until needed."
4,Solved my laundry room problem,"My laundry room is small, so this allows me to hang up clothes from the dryer and when not needed folds up out of the way. Installed easily, though I mounted the unit into the stud to be sure it did not come off the wall."
4,Andy & Me,"YES read ""Andy & Me"" for a quick overview and high-level understanding of the LEAN process. The book will not tell you how to create the LEAN process but will give you a basic understanding to build on and insight into the questions you may need to ask for your particular situation."
2,A quick read but not worth it.,"I had hoped this book would provide more detail on TPS, but it is very light on any detail and glosses over many points. After you have read The Goal and are use to its style of teaching manufacturing principles in the context of a novel, this book leaves you feeling really disappointed."
2,Don't waste your time,"This book took about an hour and a half to read, and while quick, it wasn't worth the effort. The LEAN portion of the book was vague with little explanation, the characters were shallow and unrealistic, and the details in the book were pretty pointless for the most part. While it wasn't terribly written, it seemed very rushed and I gained little to nothing from having read it. A textbook would have been more informative, and a true novel would have been more interesting. Save your time and don't bother with this one."
4,Stop picking on this book!,I can't believe people would pick on this book.There could be a hundred reasons why Luke skywalker was flying in a y wing fighter and it never says that there can't be more than one grand moff.And most kids wont care.
2,Disappointing,"From the advertisement, we thought we were buying a lot of stickers. Nope. Just a few. It was very disappointing; the stickers are way overpriced for the quantity included."
1,Don't buy it!,"No matter how much you may want to see this film, DON'T BUY IT. This transfer was made from a beat up, soft, poor-contrast 16mm print, and to release it on Blu-ray was nothing short of thievery on the part of Toho or whoever was responsible. The film is worthwhile, but unless they issue a new Blu-ray transfer from good 35mm source material save your money."
2,Raymond Burr vs. Gonzilla,I bought this DVD because my 4-year grandaughter is fasinated with Godzilla. It didn't hold her attention or mine. There was more of Raymond Burr than Godzilla.
2,It's been 50 Years - Retire the Round-Eye Version!,"I won't claim this is a movie review - everything said previously about the glorious original Japanese version (which I have as a VHS dub from laser disc) is true.For the 50th anniversary of ""Gojira,"" and with the original film making the rounds of specialty theaters in a new 35mm print described as ""beautiful,"" it's time to retire the ""Steve Martin"" farce of the Raymond Burr version once and for all. Then maybe we can concentrate on the REPEAT Steve Martin farce from ""Gojira 1985,"" a film which I must say is every bit forgettable except as it elements from it have recurred at Toho Studio's occasional whim."
1,This is the WRONG Godzilla,"I recently saw the ORIGINAL Godzilla released in 1954, which was directed by I. Honda. The AMERICAN version has""cut out"" critical footage to make the film ""lacking in writing and direction"" by Terry Morse. This version is a rock solid lack of truth, because of the failure of Hollywood to ""leave it alone"".All reading this review should see the original and not purchase the 1956 version which has been ""cut to ribbons""The film because of Hollywood is a disaster, and should be avoided at all costs"
4,"Great Movie, Lousy packaging","The remastering job is very good, although I thought the quality was going to be a lot better. Still very grainy, and scratchy. Well, it is almost 60 years old. And the packaging is terrible. It's hard to pull out the inner piece, and when do you do finally get it out, the boolket falls out. There is no slot for the booklet. The whole thing is in cheap flimsy cardboard.The ""Gojira"" packaging from 2006, is far better."
5,Skip the version without Raymond Burr,"I have seen (properly, in a movie theater) both the Japanese version and the American version that includes Raymond Burr.The Japanese version is ""fair"" but harder to follow. The American version includes Raymond Burr with superior editing."
1,Big disappointment,"The version that was released on DVD a couple of years ago is by far the best. This version is supposed to be ""restored""? My copy still has the scratches in the frames and skips every now and then. My biggest disappointment is that it does not include the reworked Raymond Burr version. Yes, I could have read that it didn't but I ASSUMED it did like the previous release did. For you purists out there it is a grand thing, but for me I wish I had of passed on this."
2,"Not a ""Catch""","I am not an actual belly dancer, but I have been doing it since i was very young. I saw the price and i thought it was a good deal, when i got the thing home and tied it on, to show the rest of my family, my mom asked me were those beads rolling across the floor part of my scarf. The scarf says it is 60' long. but if you have forty inch or more hips like me, it wont work for you."
4,Great for beginners,"Great for beginners, priced well, unless you have very wide hips. I suggest that you also buy some spare coins as all coin skirts lose a few here and there. All those shimmy's shake them loose. Hungry Lion Imports, where these hip scarves come from sells spares."
5,You MUST hear this!,"This is an AWESOME CD on many levels! Purely on an artistic level, this great music from a really diverse collection of very talented artists. There are all kinds of sounds here, and I'm enjoying them all! On a lyrical level, this is a really poetic and deeply moving body of work. (Though I would like to see some English liner notes for those of us who don't speak Arabic! As good as this is, I don't want to miss a single word!)It is RIGHTEOUS. It gives you hope for the future to hear these young, intelligent people!You NEED to hear this!!!"
4,"Emancipation, Reconstruction, and Civil Rights","Forever Free, by Eric Foner, is a condensed telling of how African-Americans went from slaves to full citizens. While not as detailed as his book on Reconstruction, or even as detailed as his Short History of Reconstruction, Foner's Forever Free does a good job introducing the reader to the struggles the freed blacks faced after emancipation in the 1860s, and the hardships they faced through a hundred years of Jim Crow and intimidation, north and south, to the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th Century."
3,Good General Knowledge. Not much detail,Gave a good overall view of PeopleSoft. Not enough detail to be really useful.
3,Good try,"Numerous topics were covered, however; some sections were hard to follow and were only specific to author's systems. Not geared for someone justing getting into Peoplesoft"
2,Christian families beware,"This is my first Clement-Davies book and as a grandmother and fantasy book lover, I read books for enjoyment and to be able to ""connect"" with my grandchildren through books. I thought the writing to be interesting but not a page-turner; goes a bit slowly. I will not share this book with my grandchildren. As most fantasy books, there is magic and wizardry, but this one specifically targets Jesus and Christianity and I cannot recommend for Christian families with children. As a whole book, it is not even entertaining enough to recommend period. I will read one of this other books for a fair comparison of his writing skills."
5,A beauty!,Something to enjoy the most imaginative matter that can man think. Simple and completely suitable in order to review and learn the most beautiful disciplin in history.
2,Pitch Black - Woe is Me,"I will never learn. I go willy-nilly through trying to pick music that I might like; I get caught up in all the adjectives used to describe this music, and then I get the CD.In my opinion, Black Party 2002 can be summed up in ONE word: TIRED. No song moved me; in fact, I thought they all were just a cut above so-so.Disappointed again."
5,Wintry Reviews,"The story, Is that you, Winter?, is about a petulant, old man who brings snow to the land from the back of his truck. He questions and grumbles about why he has to go to work, but foremost, he wonders for whom he makes it snow. The tale in itself, though brief and concise, has a heart-warming ending. The art work in the book paints vivid images of the wintry landscape. The illustrations, done in colored pencils and watercolors, are a thrown-together mixture of light and dark shades. The swirling colors provide the rough, scratchy text with more meaning than the words could possibly convey on their own. The child may only see pretty pictures and hear an interesting story, but deeper meanings could be contrived from the story itself. The tale shows that no matter how disdainfully a person views their work, they may generate the snow that warms someone's heart. The book is excellent, and I recommend it to anyone who wishes to read an intriguing story."
4,Great!,Great book with beautiful illustrations. I bought this as a gift after seeing it being used in a classroom. Love it!
4,Stankowicz on piano,"This moody and slow cd of the trumpetplayer Tomasz Stanko is pretty good. Just not good enough for 5 stars, but that doesn't mean you should leave it be.The album has the same atmosphere as (other) ECM piano-albums: melodic and free at the same time, with a lot of slow music on it. The music is subtle and very easy to listen to, but the occasional free-jazz elements restrain it from getting boring.The bass and drum are often used in a percussion-like way, and not in a rhythmic way, just like other ECM-material.Marcin Wasilewski pianoplaying is so present (and good) that I think it's almost more a piano-album than a trumpet-album. And that really is a compliment for Stanko, who leaves room enough for his band to play. Stanko's playing is moody and most of the time very accessible.There's just one thing. When you own more work of the ECM label you can get bored with the same approach over and over again. It that way this album has nothing new to offer, but it's still pretty good."
1,High speed adventures,I bought 4 dvd's from the real wheels collection and was very disappointed. Lots of commentary and very little shots of things in action. Did not keep the attention of my preschooler--or the adults watching with him.
3,"The Johnny Mann Singers, Johnny Mann","This is a good CD, but not the one I was looking for. The best of the three is The Johnny Mann Singers, Up Up and Away etc. For choral music, Johnny Mann was up there with Ray Charles, Ray Coniff and Percy Faith"
2,Disappointing,"The music is fun and purely Mann, but the transfer to CD is obviously direct from a record on a turntable and with all the inherent noise. You will be disappointed with the sound quality sad to say."
3,Good,"The disc is OK, almost new, but he plastic box was broken and the single was so expensive, even when it's in a good contition, the CD was used, so the price was so high."
3,Amazing Photos & Footage......But Kind Of Boring,"I purchased this DVD thinking it would be like the documentaries I see on Discovery, A&E, TLC, etc... But it's not quite a documentary, it's an interview along with some amazing photos of crop circles and footage of white orbs forming a crop circle. It lacks the flow of a documentary and information, and it has no plot. It got kind of boring besides the photos and footage. The music on the main menu was creepy which made us believe it would be a very entertaining DVD. But it wasn't that entertaining. Overall, it was an OK DVD, but I have seen better crop circle documentaries on TV."
2,This book was far too shallow.,"The author obviously knows what he is talking about. However, he is quite inept at explaining to his reader what he is doing. In fact, he rarely tries. He just has sample code, helps you set up the java webserver, then has you run the code. It is more about webserver configuration than it is about servlet programming"
1,Don't waste your money,"Sketchy coverage. I have gained very little from this book. There are much better books: Core Servlets,Hall; O'reilly Servlets, Hunter ..."
3,Good for starters,"This book is easy to understand, written in a very clear way. But it's very very basic. If you don't know much about Java Servlets, this should be a very good way to start with - but if you're looking for a book with more info, this one isn't suitable. By the way, there were many strange inaccurate facts in the book. (i.e., the author says ""Many people believes cookies can be a risk to user's privacy, which is obviously not true"". I took an entire course about these things - Has the author EVER heard of DoubleClick? . Also, where did the author get the idea that Microsoft Access comes with Windows.. you have to buy it separately)"
5,Another well written book by Roberts,"Each time I come back to one of Roberts book I am reminded how well she tells a story. This always comes to mind after reading other writers. Although many of the themes are similar, the development of the characters, the flow of the storyline, and her use of very visual words always remind me what a master storyteller she is."
5,Exciting,Nora Roberts at her best. This book was exciting and suspenseful. Kept me reading for hours. Had to make myself put it down.
1,THIS GAME STINKS,This game ...[is horrible]. You fly around uncontrolably. You press the shoot button and nothing happens.DONT BUY THIS GAME.
2,no so great,When I first saw this I said oh great something for the two of us to enjoy at the same time. No so right. It was ok. I have had better toys
5,Good Product Worth The Money,"I tried to find this product locally, but to no avail. Most online products were what I did not want nor could afford. This fit my needs great."
1,Cheaply Made Switch - not worth over $5,"This switch is as plain and simple as it can be - just a cheap metal casing with a crude switch and the wires going to the ports. As small as it already is, it could have been made into something even less than half the size. 90% of the space in the case is air."
5,Excellent switch!,"Excellent product for the prize! It is listed as VGA, but it is definitely SVGA. I used it to connect my MAC ibook and my PC to an HP L1710 17"" LCD display. I am able to switch between both of them seamlessly. It works even if one of the computers is in a screen-saver or sleeping mode. Out of curiosity, I tried different resolutions and refresh frequencies. The switcher worked up to 1280 by 1024 at 85 Hz refresh rate, though I am typically using it at 1024 by 768 at 65 Hz.Just be aware that there are many fraud copies of this switcher advertised under the same name DB15, but at cheaper prize (< $10). And they have very poor reviews. That is not for the real model. So, be aware that you are purchasing the original at the right prize!"
2,Wavy lines no matter what I do,"Thought it would work better than it does. No matter what I've done, I can't get rid of the wavy lines that distort either of the monitors. I'd return it if it wasn't too late."
3,Not bad,This variation on a post-apocalyptic tale has battling factions amongst the last humans trying to make a go at colonizing a not terribly friendly system. Decent characters and writing make this story pretty good until the end just fizzles out.
3,A good informative Book,"I am managing a SMS Site. I bought the book to refresh my memory and it didn't dissapoint me. I don't believe that this book was written to prepare you for the SMS test. However, the title states that it is for administrators of SMS. There are a few mistakes -In a rush to be printed?. If you manage a SMS Site you will probably find some good points for before and after the implementation."
1,Have seen better,"The Belle of New York was very disappointing to me.Considering the dancing talent involved, I would have thought this movie to be quite good. No way! The songs are corny, the plot is second rate, and worst of all, Fred Astaire and Vera-Ellen just don't fit in. It's a waste of their dancing talent.The only thing I liked was the humor and that's about it.Save your money and don't buy it. I would recommend ""Three Little Words"" instead. Fred and Vera are great in that movie."
5,BEST DANCE CD!,"I just got this CD and it's the BEST! I'm a big fan of Masterbeat and Dance Music, and this is one of the best compilations out there. I listen to it all the time -- in the car, at the gym. It has a great mix of songs and really gets me going. DJ Brett Henrichsen really outdid himself this time. And it's a great quality CD -- I found no problems with the tracks."
3,Valuable opinion on this CD.,"The songs selected to create this mix were very good but I found a problem with track #3, #7. I found #3 vocals distorted as if the recording was turned too high. #7 volume of track goes too low to be normal. Buy this CD if you don't mind skipping these 2 tracks."
5,this game is awesome,"This game is cool. Its really fun to play. If you are a spiderman fan, this is a good game to get."
4,"If you love Spider-Man, then get this game.","I waited a long time for a Playstation version of Spider-Man to come out. Sega Genesis was pretty useless once this system came out, so the few Spider-Man games they had were obsolete.This game was rather good, a little short though. The graphics were fairly good and so was the story, but it came short of twists and turns. I knew from the very beginning that the villains behind the symbiote invasion scheme were Dr. Octopus and Carnage. Still, it's a fairly good game. If you're a Spider-Man fan, you won't be dissapointed in getting this game."
5,AWSOME FULL OUT 3D GAME.,"This game is great. I recommend it to anyone who likes to play anykind of game. I didn't even know who Spider man was intill i played a demo of the game, then i knew i had to have it. THe game has an Awsome full out 3d inviroment, and you can go through all of it. At some times you are fighting and at atother times you are just webslinging through New York City. I bought the game the first day it came out. And I didn't even know SpiderMan was a comic character intill someone told me. THE GAME RULES get it. It is the best game I have played for my playstation."
4,Better then the one based on the movie!,"This game has alot of my favirote Spidey villians and allies like The Black Cat,Venom,Carnage,Doc Ock,Lizard,Mysterio,The Rhino,The Torch,Daredevil and Captin America I only wish they had Kraven though!The game is harder then the one based on the movie,mutch more FUNNER,mutch more LEVELS,mutch more VILLIANS that I like too!"
3,POOR Shipping,"The product is great, but Amazon needs to figure out a better way to package them. I recieved the shipment in a box that was torn to shreds. 4 bowls and 2 mugs were in several pieces. I tried calling someone, but finding an 800 number for Amazon customer service is next to impossible."
5,I like it and my daughter likes it,Good instruction with pictures and repetition/set recommendation per age group. Free weights are cover (which is what we use) but machines are there as well. I wish the organization was a little better and it had some tear-out check sheets but overall a good deal.
5,A fresh approach,"This book is putting forward a set of common-sense, practical ideas about the way the human mind works. It explains very interesting theories on a range of subjects, such as; dreaming, psychosis and autism, in an entertaining and highly readable way, drawing on a range sources - from ancient philosphy to the latest scientific research. Each area is dealt with chapter by chapter; so you can dip in and out at your leisure. But more importantly, the book gives us a valuable 'manifesto' for the way in which people should approach their lives. It will be thought provoking not only for mental healthcare professionals, but for anyone interested in finding out more about themselves. The numerous recommendations (Radio 4, Doris Lessing etc. etc.) inside the front cover and on the book's reverse are endorsements that speak for themselves."
3,Great Book on Attitude,"Zig Ziglar was the first motivational anyone I ever listened going way back when, so I have to love the guy, and I love everything he has to say in this book, however, and it's a small however, I have hard time reading this book. I've read it twice and it just makes time seem motionless and uncomfortable. I can listen to Zig Ziglar speak all day long. I love to hear him tell stories, even the same ones, but the reading of it seems different. However again, if you want a book that upon reading it, will implant an example of a perfectly glorious way of looking at the world, a prefect attitude, then you need to have this as part of your permanent library."
5,Not to be missed.,"Wallace Shawn, Julianne Moore, Brooke Smith, and the rest of the cast do amazing work. Even in their street clothes the actors seem to inhabit the lives of their characters."
1,rip-off publisher,"Great book, a classic, but... It should be illegal for publishers to sell books with so many errors in it. There are mistakes on virtually every page: spelling, bad punctuation, wrong letters, etc. It seems they OCR'ed the text and forgot to proof it, not even a spell check (or maybe the spell check changed some of the words on them to something other than what the author wrote) and now they are making money from it. If you want to purchase this book, please do so from a different publisher."
1,Buy Another Edition,"To read this edition of a classic is to weep. It is rife with typos, mispellings, omissions, with the occasional paragraph break where there is no grammatical or editorial reason for one. Better a good used edition than this!"
1,Good book ruined by an incompetent publisher,"This may have been a fine work in its original form, but this edition (Wilder Publications, 2008) is so shoddy, it isn't worth the effort to try to read it. Based on my own experience with OCR software, I would guess that this publisher scanned an old copy, translated it to text, then reformatted it, and printed it. There is no evidence that anyone proofread it prior to printing. It it doubtful that it was even run through a spell-check program. Periods are missing at the ends of sentences; words are left out; ""d"", ""h"", and ""b"" are confused; apostrophies are inserted randomly (probably fly-spots on the original), ""and"" repeatedly appears as ""an"", ""modern"" almost always appears as ""modem"", etc. ad infinitum.I read through about a fourth of the book before giving up in exasperation."
1,Typos,"I love most of Chesterton's works and this is no exception. The typos, however, made it hard to read a took away from the experience, it was very frustrating. I highly recommend that you read this book but urge you to get it from a different publisher."
3,Not as easy as it looks.,"I suppose you have to be somewhat of a self motivator for this DVD. It wasn't terrible, though you should have some familiarity with crocheting prior to this DVD."
5,The surprise is on our side !,"The pride beyond the honor and the duty .The unexhausted sea chase , a cat and mouse chess game ; a fantastic voyage to Galapagos Islands ; important lessons about the leadership .The film contains so many different issues but so well integrated and edited that the movie runs about 130 min .This movie will become in a status film through the years . The handle camera of Peter Weir , the photography is simply marvelous.The artistic direction is first rate and the Russell Crowe was magnificent .So what happened with all those superb adjectives ? and Why was this film so neglected in the Academy Awards?The answer may be in those clever words of Don Quixote :Cosas veredes , Sancho.Please , acquire as soon as you can this work .Fascinating and breathtaking take after take."
5,Master and Commander,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and he and I both enjoyed this film very much. Great story, great acting."
4,As good as it gets,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie when I was thinking about seeing it in the theatre. To be honest it was the title.Master, of what? My first thought was that he was a slave driver or some kind of insane tyrant.But sadly to say the joke was on me or was it. Because there is nothing like a surprise when you don't expect to get lucky. This is real entertainment with a real story.Not like the convoluted mess we see so often these days. It is simple yet complex. The players are all well recognized,and you learn things about the small world they live in.Russell Crowe is great at the part And I appreciate his relationship with the doctor."
5,An inspiring adventure!!,This was such a great film! I think it's one of the top three films of 2003! It was so historically accurate and entertaining! I highly suggest it!
2,Poor Copy,Very poor copy. Too dark to see in many parts.No more DVDs from Amazon. I will buy thiselsewhere
4,M & C is a wonderful adventure on the sea,This movie is good for all ages to see. Under Peter Weir's direction this film makes the voyage very real for the viewer of what it would have been like to be on a British ship battling the French and what it's like living on a ship during that era. The cinematography is gorgeous. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are very convincing as longtime friends. The rest of the cast especially the young boy were very good. I would love to see a sequel made based on another one of the series of M & C books with the same actors. It is a wonderful adventure at sea.
1,It's boring,"This movie is boring. There's nothing here that I like. I know people like it because of the pyschology and the emotion depicited in the film. Somehow, it does not appeal to me."
1,Won't work in Europe,"I ordered this BluRay from Germany, but unfortunately it won't work n my BD Player (PS3) because it proteced with a stupid region Code.Now what sense does it make to protect BluRays that are also available in Europe and partially older releases?Well, be advised european customers, DO NOT buy this BD unless your player can handle it (there is only very few)..."
4,"I loved it; at least, what I could make out of the dialog","Thoroughly enjoyable adventure yarn, but damned if I could make out a lot of the dialogue. Too much mumbling or was it just poor audio quality? I'm actually quite familiar with British dialect and British accent, but far too many spoken lines were unintelligible. Maybe I should find an edition with captions ... :-)"
2,Extended Cat and Mouse Scene,"The movie has no more plot than a cat and mouse sequence that never ends. In the parts where I wished the movie would slow down, it went too fast. In the parts where I wished the movie would speed up, it went too slow.If you're looking for an intellectually stimulating film, steer clear of Master and Commander. It's a cat and mouse chase that lacks creativity. I thought the chase scenes in the Matrix were long, but compared to Master and Commander, Matrix's sequences are short and deep. Master and Commander is only a thriller, there is nothing epic about it."
4,"Good movie, better disc!","I didn't know what to expect, in fact, I actually expected this to be a long drawn out movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a good story that keeps your interest. Although the picture quality of this blu ray is excellent, the sound steals the show. Those with a capable speaker setup (especially the sub) will benefit the most. In the first scene it sounded and felt like the canon ball was going straight through my room. There are even times where it seems like things were gonna fall on my head. If you've never seen this movie, I would rent it first. If you have seen the movie, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this blu ray just for its demo worthy soundtrack."
2,The New Horatio Hornblower Series is Much Much Better,"Yes they both have the costumes, the floggings, the weevils crawling from the biscuits and of course the swashbuckling action but what separates them is the sense of believability and attachment to the characters that Master and Commander never comes close to. I also found the script awkward and unbelievable and the pedestrian plot is an afterthought. The new Horatio Hornblower series is a much better take on this exciting era and it captures the sense of adventure and romance on the deep seas that makes it linger in your memory while Master and Commander has long faded away."
1,Disappointing & Boring,"You can't make up for poor directing and boring dialogue with special effects.This movie was a complete failure. I would give it no stars if that was possible. Having read all of the Lucky Jack novels I was hoping that Russell Crowe would be able to bring to the screen something of what Patrick O'Brian had created in his 20 novel series. After the first hour I had to begin fast forwarding. It was a complete and total waste of my time. Even if I had not read the novels, this movie was just poorly done. I didn't care about the characters, the fighting scenes had good special effects but since I don't watch a movie for the special effects this did nothing to add to a movie that simply didn't make it as far as directing or acting was concerned. Save your money and time, give this movie a miss. Or better yet, get a copy of Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando."
1,Crappy & a Fraud,"I haven't the slightest notion how good or bad this film might be. The idiots who sent it chose the PAL format instead of the United States format of NTSC - so it's useless to me - - - thanks a lot , fellas!!"
4,Master and Commander: Grade A-,"Master and Commander is a slow, but good epic telling the story of Captain Jack Aubrey, a valiant sailor played by Russel Crowe. The story is set amidst the open ocean, in which Aubrey is frequently attacked by the French army. The story tends to be slow at times and the characters lack development even with the films length. What holds the movie together is its realism and accuracy to history and the period. Russel Crowe gives a performance worthy of Oscar nods but doesn't outshine his roles in Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind. This film is a must see of 2003 and a great film for fans of films like Treasure Island and Mutiny on the Bounty."
4,Best Naval War Movie.,"It could have used a battle somewhere in the middle but the one at the beginning and end are realistic and well done. The story is about friendship, honor, and duty. There is alot of dramatic things such as when the man gets knocked overboard during the well done storm sequence, the man drowning himself with a cannonball as a weight, and the 2 main characters playin music together and fighting over right and wrong. Overall its a good war drama, with good action, performances, drama, cinematography, and visuals. I give it a 8 out of a 10 because it needs a battle in the middle to help quicken the pace a little to make it more watchable but everything else is good entertainment."
3,sapscript,I bought the book as a reference. I found that it was little better than reading the online documentation. If you can get to the help then you don't need this book.
2,"Good for ABAP programmers, less so on the SAPscript side","This is the only book on SAPscript. So someone should write a better one. There definitely is a demand for such a book. Using SAPscript often means using ABAP and this aspect is covered well. The actual SAPscript bit is elementary, not providing much more than the online documentation. In particular, I missed tips and tricks for designing more complex layouts, variably sized boxes, up- and downloading RTF documents and workarounds for unusually implemented features (bugs). This book is merely an introduction to SAPscript, nothing more."
1,How about 0 Stars!!!,"This rating is not about the performances, which are amazing as always. The rating comes from the fact that Columbia decides to continuously reissue the same material, most of which is not that great compared to other versions of the same songs. It is a true shame that Columbia seems to think that no one would be interested in a complete reissue of the catalog of music. It is even more frustrating when you see titles on this CD like, ""Royal Canal"", and think ""Wow, this must be from ""Bold Fenian Men"", only to find out it's an inferior release from ""Ain't it Grand?"" Same with ""Old Orange Flute"". We would much prefer the version from ""Live in Ireland"". And how about some other fantastic songs that ARE greatest hits?? Columbia, you should hang your head in shame. ""Ain't it Grand?"" I Think Not!"
2,It's Okay.,The movie was okay. It's one of the better Godzilla films.The one thing that REALLY makes this movie stink is that the unstoppable Godzilla was beaten by bugs! That SUCKS!
2,"okay, not great","I'd say this one is okay, but there's nothing really that great about it. godzilla looks impressive here, but rather clumsy. The special effects are good. plenty of scenes of the milatary attacking godzilla, which are more enjoyable then the fight scenes which are brief and boring, can't understand how godzilla lost to two little catapillars when he just should have stomped em, pretty embarising. However, nothin's worse than listening too those little twin faries singing."
1,DEATH TO FULLSCREEN!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!! ""Godzilla VS Mothra"" Is a great movie, it is a shame that it is presented here, with this DVD, in a full screen format. I just watched the uncut, Japanese LETTER BOX version DVD a friend loaned me, and was greatly disappointed at just how much the American full screen formatted version destroys the film. Do yourself a favor and don't wast your time or money on this FULL SCREEN PIECE OF CRAP, for it is unworthy of a space in your DVD collection. Wait for the letter box version."
2,"Good movie, but the DVD presentation falls short...","Let it be known that I'm an avid Godzilla fan, and I wanted some DVDs for my new DVD player, so I bought this DVD. Boy, was I disappointed! There's really only 3 extras on the DVD--interactive menus with scene selection, a Destroy All Monsters Game Cube promo, and audio set-up options (english mono and 5.1 Surround sound). The 5.1 Surround sound echoes and sounds unbarable. Options to change the language to Japanese, and add/remove subtitles would've been nice, as I don't care for dubs. The picture's quality is really bad--there's scratches, and what not, making it seem like a bad video transfer. Still, the promo's pretty cool, the animated intro by Mothra's kinda neat. Overall, this DVD is worth picking up only if you can't get a hold of Simitar's superior version."
4,MOTHRA RULES! THE SHOBIJINN RULE!,"Godzilla vs Mothra: The Battle for Earth is the longest titled Godzilla film and one of the best.Rating 4 out of 5This film remains true to the original Mothra with a great plot, subplot, characters and monsters. I especially like Battra, who kicked butt and died to save all our hides. The scenes of Mothra searching for it&#65533;s masters isbeautifully done, with a nice red horizon in the background. Unfortunately, creators create new Cosmos. They&#65533;re now done up in red and gold dresses with pulled back hairdos. Their singing can be quite annoying, and their newcostumes makes them no where near as cute as in the original, where they were done up in neat little gray parkas with white fuzz. That was the straw that broke the camels back, in my own opinion. I give this a ****."
4,Fun sounds puzzle.,I was happy to find that the Little Touch Leap Pad made puzzles for their product. My daughter has recently become interested in peg puzzles and she likes her Little Touch Leap Pad so I thought this might be a good purchase. I have been very happy with this puzzle. She enjoys the sounds song and game. She also really likes horses so the horse in the heart shape is definately her favorite. I am planning on purchasing the 'Let's get moving' puzzle. I wish they had one that was maybe pets as my daughter loves cats as well. I gave it four stars because it's not something she plays with every day but she does enjoy it in short intervals when I bring it out. (About 2 or 3 times a week). I still think it is worth the purchase especially from Amazon/Toys R Us. It is more expensive through other sources.
4,Bought it twice.,"I got this version a couple of weeks ago for 99 cents!It was on a CD with something else. But bought a second copy for twenty bucks for a friend who is an opera singer. [The Colony sells it for $40!]Even though the film quality sucks and the sound quality is mediocre, the enunciation, and the ACTING and the HUMOR from seeing the PRINCIPALS make up for the film's shortcomings. It has a lot of laughs. These are seasoned professionals and they know what they are doing.We thoroughly enjoyed it, and even though the new onewas even more enjoyable [PBS - Clive Revill one], it's worth buying."
4,A true delight,"All Savoyards should enjoy this presentation of the classic ""Mikado"". The picture & sound while not up to today's HD & 5.1 standards are more than adequate for when the film was made & the best you will ever see.My one disapointment is the deletion of the song ""I've got him on my list"", which is however shown as a deleted scene. The song was apparently left out as one of the people on the list was Hitler & being as the film was made in 1939 & the USA was still trying to avoid being embroiled in WW2, I imagine it was thought politic at the time to omit the reference.Something I was surprised to see was an introductory act actually showing the reason why the Mikado's son ran away from court, (complete with daughter-in-law elect).This is the first Criterion edition I have viewed & the extras including a rather scholarly talk by G&S; experts, I found very interesting & informative. So for those of you who enjoy Gilbert & Sullivan this is recommended."
3,"Worth watching, but beware of deficiencies","Satisfying if approached as a film, rather than an opera. The cuts have already been mentioned. For me, the biggest disappointment was in the sound quality of the DVD. It doesn't seem that any restoration was attempted for this old soundtrack.This is a movie with some fun performances, but from this disc you can't really appreciate Sullivan's incredible music, which for me is the appeal of this opera, not the silly (and often grisly) story."
3,Formula Offering,"Josephine Tey is a member of the Golden Age of Mysteries. A SHILLING FOR CANDLES does not have the special Tey touch in the plot, but kicks you with a surprise ending that lacks development.After all the plodding around with dead ends, several likely suspects the conclusion arrive in much to swift a manner. It is as if she got tired of the story and wrapped it up to get on with something else.Vintage Tey, even on the downside is a good read, just to one for a good night's sleep.Nash Black, author whose books are available in Kindle editions.HaintsWriting as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers"
1,Cute but Uncomfortable,"Cute shoes, but extremely uncomfortable. I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes. I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair. I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned. This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit. I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big, it's a catch 22."
5,"New Taste, New Face, Old Triumph","I have been an Oasis fans since their 2nd album was out. Since then I owned every album that has been released (including few singles). This one gave us, Oasis fans, a new taste. Lets clap our hands for Liam's 1st written single ""Little James"" one of the ballads here. What can I say, the lads did it again. With two new faces Oasis still one of the best bands in the world and share the chair with U2. My favorite song here is Sunday Morning Call."
2,Don't believe the hype...this is their worst,"Having been a fan of Oasis since almost literally day one (I saw them for 5 bucks at the old 9:30 Club in DC), I have followed this band VERY closely...bought all the b-sides, etc. This album is mediocre. There are maybe 3 or 4 songs that are worth listening to over and over again. It is stale, there is not much of a new direction at all except for the first (explicit) track. Buy this used, or find it as a promo, but don't drop $17. Liam sounds good, but if you're looking for more songs like ""Wonderwall"" or even ""Don't Go Away"", you won't find them here. And NOTHING here matches the brilliance of ""Definitely Maybe"", which is still probably their finest moment."
1,Wannabe Beatles,It seems that they have always tried to be like The Beatles in everyway of their career. They keep telling everyone they are greater than Jesus - the world only took note when The Beatles said it. This album is REALLY disappointing and shows the weak(est?) side of Oasis...great sound when snapped.
3,No need for Liam....,"Its good to here a bit of a different sound from them, especially after the utterly boring Be Here Now. heck, noel didn't even like THAT album.SOTSOG is a nice move away from the same old, same old....BUT it kinda falls short. It's like they couldn't figure out what they wanted to go for soundwise. it reminds me vaguely of U2 during there achtung baby phase. Hopefully they won't follow U2's footsteps. I hope they do something along the lines of what Ian Brown did on his second solo album which is BANGIN' by the way.ANYWAY, the best songs of the album are of course the ones sung by noel...lord knows why liam's there at all. Noel has a far smoother and greater vocal range. Sing it all Noel! get rid of the whiney baggage you call a brother. Ahhh, i digress."
1,Terrible,"I am not a fan, I don't like Oasis, I never did. They did have some good melody, now, even that is gone with the wind. The single `Go Let It Out'is supposed to be a progressive move for them, it sounds like they have been hanging around with the Beta Band for a long time, it would be good if they had the latter's standard. Poor imitation! They are trying very hard to sound like bands like Pink Floyd or the Beta Band, not Beatles anymore? People move on? Have these people grown smarter? NO WAY!! They are still stubborn and stuck-up as ever. Feel like doing them justice now, Liam has good voice and if he wants to, he can really do some fantastic stuff like what Thom Yorke does to his voice, in a different way, of course. Back to the subject, this is a terrible album, by anybody's standard,yet it still sells better than Beta Band. Isn't it ironic?"
1,oasis' time has been over for years,oasis had its glory days (i.e. definitely maybe and what's the story morning glory) but now they're DEAD and GONE. it all went downhill with be here now. just because they've maintained their sound from the said previous albums (which isn't even necessarily a good thing) doesn't mean this album is good. go let it out wouldn't have even been deemed worthy of release if it had been on what's the story morning glory. now they're just a waste of airtime and money.
2,average,"actually not even average at times, that's why i give it 2 stars. satisfactory but not comparable to their previous work, which can be astounding at its best. buy only if you feel you must try every Oasis cd there is. the last Cd was much better though, and that says a lot..."
4,Just Give It Time,"As a long time fan of Oasis and there previous albums, I must say that this CD took me by surprise. After reading all the bad reviews and bad comments made about the CD, I was happily surprised to fine that this CD is really GOOD! I wouldn't call it there best effort, however, by no means is it as bad as some people have made it out to be. Tracks such as ""Go Let It Out"" and ""Little James"" are reminisent of the Oasis of old. While tracks like ""Who Feels Love?"" allows the listener to hear a new side of the group. The only reason this CD didn't receive 5 stars was because the CD has a real ""Noel influence"" deficency. However, Liam does a good job picking up the slack. P.S. The bonus track on the 2nd CD ""Let's All Make Believe"" is one of Oasis best songs ever."
4,Another gem for Oasis,"Noel does it again. Finally, after some time off, Oasis released SOTSOG. It was well worth that wait. Noel has come up with another set of classics that'll surely add more luster to the Oasis lore. The lyrics are fantastic, especially on ""Who Feels Love?"", ""Where Did It All Go Wrong?"", ""Sunday Morning Call"", and on the bonus track ""Let's All Make Believe."" The music is also great, matching the mood of the lyrics. Overall, this is another job well done for the band. But I still yearn for an album that'll match ""Defintitely Maybe"" and ""What's the Story? (Morning Glory)""."
3,As networking introduction,Excellent coverage of all aspect of networking but lots of error especially in the tcp/ip subnetting section. This book made a great introduction to the world of networking.
3,Then she found me.,"Was watching TV and ran into this movie. Couldn't watch the rest of it and by chance I just looked it up on Amazon. Like always I wasn't let down, they had it and it was so affordable I just ordered it and got to finish watching it. Wasn't the best but I enjoyed it...."
3,Just ok,"Acting good, subject matter ok story ok. Didn't read the book so no comment on that regard. Somewhat unrealistic ending. ."
1,Sad,"This movie was reccommended to us by a relative who enjoyed it. Throughout the whole movie, April (Hunt), just makes a bigger mess of her life. I was waiting for something signifigant to happen, something good, but it never did. The ending was nice but not well done. I cannot give it away but it skipped around a bit and ended abruptly."
1,Bad language alert,When a movie gives Jesus the F word as a middle name I can't watch it and it is all over for me.
3,meh,Not bad. Kinda slow and frustrating at parts but Helen Hunt is a fantastic actress & Colin Firth a fabulous actor so it's go that going for it.
5,Then She Found Me,"I really liked this movie, funny that I'd never seen an advertisement about it. Sadly probably not too many people saw it because they didn't know about it. Great cast and great story line. I was very impressed. Thanks for having it on Prime."
3,Different,"We were looking for a different kind of movie, not stupid or intense - - well, it's different.The story itself is ok, although it took a while to get into it because it starts off pretty heavy, comedy comes in many guises - but we stuck it out in hopes of it getting better.Helen Hunt is excellent, as usual. Bette Midler is excellent, as usual. Colin Firth is also excellent, as usual. Sorry, I'm not a Broderick fan - so am uncertain if it was his character or him.Confusion rules the movie, it's emotional without a lot of emotional displays - very reigned in, yet effective. It's a strong topic, delivered well - but no way would I call it a comedy. Yes there are a few chuckles, but it's not funny at all. Wrapping it up the message comes through so beautifully that it was worth sitting through, enjoyable and yet doubtful of repeating. Love is painful, it hurts, answers to prayers are not necessarily what you ask for."
5,Someone who simply loves watching fim at it's finest,"I don't necessarily think that as a person, who simply enjoys watching a great movie, would care for most of these reviews listed. I am not here to give you a play by play of the film,(as I can see it has already be done. What ever happened to not giving away the storyline?) nor am I here to critique whether this was the ""right"" film for a certain movie actor/actress to partake in.So here is my two cents: I love watching people who are so incredibly talent that they can turn what would have been an ordinary movie into a warm, heart filled, brilliant film. Kudos to Helen Hunt for choosing to branch out and find other inspirations in her life. I for one am a huge fan!"
3,worth watching-once,"This is a movie with good acting and a pessimistic story. I, personally, don't enjoy watching non-uplifting stories more than once. I really enjoy seeing Bette Midler in movies, but her storyline was odd and didn't seem realistic compared with the gritty reality of the rest of the movie."
5,Sweet and deep,I thought that the lesser reviews were harsh and inappropriate... this movie has a lot of depth and heart and for those who appreciate such things you will love this movie!
3,Cute but not great,"I like the movie for the original story line. Unfortunately, the movie was extremely slow and had many predictable portions."
2,Pedestrian and somewhat trite despite good actors,"I am a big fan of all the actors in this movie. Unfortunately, the movie comes across as stilted, unrealistic and a downer. Helen Hunt, who I love, gives a grimacing, frowning performance, sans makeup. She looks tired and like she doesn't want to be in the movie. Although she has awful things happen to her, like her husband leaving,she has sex with him in a car with the door open on a public street. What? And why Colin Firth would want to be with her is a mystery.This movie is a prime example of why some actors should not be directors."
5,The path to change your life,"Amazing book. I am reading it a second time. It is the first book I have read that lays out a clear path for a life well worth living. The first time I read it I sat down and read it cover to cover in a week. It was a great way to get an overview. Now I am going through the book again and incorporating the ten steps into my everyday living. The 10 steps are not for the faint of heart and have certainly challenged me but are clearly steps to a life filled with joy and grace. Enjoy the book, a new way of looking at life and a plan to live a life well worth living."
5,Great melodies and superb writing,"I love this band. I have been listening to them since 1990 or even sooner. Their song Metallic Blue, Johnny and spirit of love are awesome. I cannot say enough about them, except Im dissappointed that they are no longer together."
1,Where's the heat?,"This one's going back to the store. It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat. If you ask me, my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat. As for the ""massage"", it's worthless to me, but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway, I prefer shiatsu. I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot, so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet!"
3,Dr. Scholl's Warming Foot Massager Comforting -- to a Degree,"I could not wait to receive this item. I suffer from various forms of arthritis, especially in my feet. Being middle-aged, I need therapy that will keep me going at work, as well as at home. The product promised therapeutic massage and relaxing heat. The massage is mainly vibration, which is comforting but not truly the massage I was expecting. Honestly, I do not notice any heat at all when I have the heat setting on. The fleece helps to warm my feet though! I enjoy it, but it is not quite what I expected."
4,Worth it.,"I'm afraid I must, to a degree, disagree with the reviewer 'Virginia'. Yes, the book had style issues, at times annoying, but it still worked.I, like her, had problems with the first little chapter, it was creepy and strangely written. But as I moved through the book - particularly the third and fourth stories - I found myself enjoying it. The fifth story was completely unreadable though.All in all, I believe Ms. Smith has potential, if it was at times misused in this novel - the story still touched me, and the ending was spectacular."
4,Keep Reading,"This is an excellent book, even if you are not in to post-modernist stuff. The reading is sometimes tedious, although well worth the work. Smith is very abstract and brillant at capturing characters."
2,Disappointing,"Hotel World is a disappointing little book. For all of its accolades and promise, it falls incredibly short. The story sounded promising, five women, two sisters, one dead. Unusual writing style, somewhat unformatted and different. Different sounded promising rather than annoying. I thought the characters mostly unlikeable and mousy. I found one character's chapter to be completely unreadable due to the complete lack of any punctuation."
3,Don't expect anything about RMAN,"Although this was an easier read than Oracle's DBA Certification Exam Guide, I expected that it would be more up to date. Oracle has had RMAN since version 8 and there is not even a reference to its existence in this book! Exam 3 is heavily weighted on RMAN and understanding it is critical to your success on the test along with your sucess as a DBA. This book needs to be updated!"
1,you wouldn't want a doctor learning this way.,"Finding an error on page 3 re: an import command shook my confidence right off of the bat! It comes with a 'crib sheet' to memorize and do a brain suck on before you take the exam...pleeze don't pursue a Professional Certification this way. Buy something like Oracle Press - Couchman read it, understand it, build you biceps and be prepared for the exam and the job."
2,They should have proofread it.,I am writing specifically about volume 3. It would be an excellent book if they had just proofread it first before rushing it for publication. Filled with mistakes and worded very poorly I still recommend this sorry book because it is one of the few 3d max sources that actually attempts to teach animation.
5,fun dvd -- 3 adventures plus extras!!,"Our family enjoys these Dave Hood shows, and this DVD contains three: There Goes a Bulldozer, all about construction vehicles; There Goes a Monster Truck, with Dave and Becky driving trucks and visiting a monster truck show; and There Goes a Tank, where Dave messes up in the military!Extras are good also: bloopers, a song and an interactive construction zone, where you watch things blow up in forward or reverse."
4,My son loves this movie!,My son is only 2 but absolutely loves this movie. We started off borrowing it from the library and had to buy it because he never wanted to return it. The acting in it is horrible and is kind of hard for an adult to watch but for my 2 year old it is perfect!
3,Borgias made in the USA,"If your last name is Borgia and you just got a green card, this is definitely the book for you. Just don't show it to the INS."
4,Do it yourselves advertising and promotion,Excellent publication although dated the concept is still very relevant. It would be helpful if it were to be updated to include all the new technologies.
4,completely collision-less full-duplex switching!,"This thing is just great, you can choose which tube you want your internets to flow through via the selector on the front, meaning no wasted packets at all, and pesky hackers can't use your computers unless you choose to let them.If you want to use more than one device at a time, I find that sitting there turning the knob back and forth gets tiring so it's best to get a small child or loyal friend with too much time on their hands to just sit there and cycle through A, B, C, D, then back to A and repeat. spreads all of your connection over the four computers brilliantly.would've given it five stars but I got a piece of carrot stuck in one of the ports and now i can't put the internet cable in. Not a major issue but i thought they would've protected against such things."
1,Not this Guy,"Who did she interview to think this is what guy's like to eat? Every recepie in here is designed for women to make sure they can collect their husbands life insurance checks from heart attacks, and still be young enough to enjoy them. Healthy? I don't think so. If you really think her meals are healthy, look how much weight she has gained over the past couple years. Every meal she uses a lot of olive oil, butter, and salty additives. then writing a recepie for ""Hamburger Salad"" Basically garden greens from a bag, and a couple fried hamburger patties placed on top of the greens, with cheese on it. Oh my...Quick, easy and ""Healthy"" meals guys like to eat. Yummo? I don't think so."
4,Deluxe pill splitter,Excellent product. It does a very good job in splitting small pills that were not meant to be split in half. Would recommend.
3,Not so great pill cutter,The item is well made and the blade is sharp and cuts well. The orange surface the pill rests on is a type of sticky material. The pills do not slide on this sticky surface and consequently the pills often do not align properly for cutting. The sticky surface also makes it difficult to get the cut pieces into the reservoir. A smoother surface that permits the pills to slide would be preferable.
3,It works. Tape gets stuck on the blade.,It's OK. I use it. Expect to waste 6 inches once in awhile unless you are very careful.
2,Disappointing.,"I pre-ordered this CD under the title ""Animalism"" which was billed as a remastered version of the 1966 original. I was disapointed when I received the ""Animalisms"" version. I owned the original ""Animalism"" back when it was first released and loved it. It has long since been worn out and lost from my collection. This compilation has left out ""Smoke Stack Lightning"", ""Hey Gyp"", ""Hit The Road Jack"", and maybe others I can't recall. Although this disc does have some great Animals material, I find the quality of the remastering poor at best. It sounds like a basement recording, too much echo and no definition of Chas Chandler's base. Bonus tracks seem to be tossed in as compensation for lack of audio quality. This disc is OK if you have no other alternatives. I'm still hoping for a release of the REAL Animalism set."
3,Himalayas...,"This is a BBC production with my beloved naturalist Sir David Attenborough and since it is not as complex as Planet series, in US is being broadcast by PBS Nature series instead of BBC without David. It is still beautiful nature."
4,Very Nice and Informative Film,We really enjoyed this film about the life in the Himalayas.I've seen it twice and happy to won it.
5,How to apply ethics in the work environment,This book was an eye opener on applying ethics in the work environment. It is amazing how an individuals ethic's differs from another individual's ethics. Very easy to read and follow.
2,"Wifey, Thats...Cheesy","I don't like this new song ""Wifey"" at all, it is well sung though, so I did add an extra point for that. At 1st it kinda sounds like their awsome song ""Too Close"" but these lyrics are just way weird."
4,EXCELLENT BUT NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"While this book is excellent and the recipes, though long, are usually easy to follow, they can still be difficult and I would recommend that a beginner start with an easier, more basic book. More advanced bakers, however, should love this book. While it concentrates on pies and tarts of all kinds, Ms. Heatter also details cobblers and crumbles, custards and glaces and much, much more. She also gives us practical advice, such as the correct way to wash fruit, etc. Real pie baking is an art, so be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into these recipes. It will be time and effort very well spent. I, myself would have preferred illustrations of some of these delicious concoctions."
3,The series drags on,"This series is getting worse and worse. In this book the rest of the Forsaken are introduced, Moghedien escapes (at the end), and two unnamed Forsaken who have died are somehow brought back to life. Other than this, (and the Forsaken do not seem very dangerous anymore), nothing happens. There is absolutely no suspense when Aes Sedai capture and shield Rand, he's obviously going to escape, and all it does is show what a fool he really is to continue to trust them. Elayne and Nynaeve must find a ter'angreal to combat the heat which Shai'tan is causing, but until some enemy besides the weather is found the book has no real interest. Padan Fain, one of the few characters I found compelling, (although he is obviously never going to get close to Rand), only appears once. Pedron Niall and the Whitecloaks are shown to have no real power. As long as all the bad guys are shown up this way, the series does not hold much interest."
3,"Good, But Unnecessarily Long","The hype on this book touts it as dominating the world Tolkien only began to reveal. But frankly the level of MUNDANE details I think could as easily be left out without damaging the series at all. Things such as the day-to-day business of running an empire would probably better be left ot a page or two of synopsis-style narrative, rather than following Rand through every detail.Heating up conflict between Rand and the Aes Sedai, and even the Asha'man and the Aes Sedai, I think is good, though. Better than having them all get along like you hope they will eventually. Keeps a good dramatic tension.Over all I say that, as with the earlier books, this one is overstuffed with details we could just as well do without, but over all still a good, engaging read."
4,Lord of Chaos,"Its a good book. I do think it gets a bit slow at times, especially when dealing with the women. I think Mr. Jordan could have left out a lot of the annoying chicks. But the ending was absolutely classic! Get on your knees wench! hahahah Fantastic, best part of the book, best part of the whole series is when Rand put the Asedi on their knees!"
1,My journey is over.,"I can make it no further. My journey is over. I loved the first and was enthralled with the second parts of my trip. I began to grow weary and slow down in the third and forth. The fifth was a crawl. The sixth, I had hoped, would revive me but alas, my pace was even slower on this even longer section and I feel I have made no progress at all. My journey to Tarmon Gai'don is over, having never reached the end. Ah, you say, it is not the end, but the journey that matters. I longer care for the journey: the scenery is poor, the way is unclear, my companions are dull, and my feet are tired. The seventh section will have to be undertaken by those stronger and more resilient than I. Good luck."
3,long-winded,"I really enjoyed reading this series, but I'm sad that the story is losing much of its focus for a variety of reasons. Lord of Chaos continues a trend in the series. Books 1-4 move along at a very nice pace. Books 5-6 are obsessed with odd character quirks and the plot moves at a considerably slacker pace. Books 7-9 are mind-numbingly slow and the repetitive descriptions of character tendencies are quite tiresome, though they have inspired some excellently entertaining commentary in these quarters. In all, don't jump into the middle of the series; if you like the first 3 you'll probably want to read all of them, though you may want to borrow 5-9."
3,Here's the deal...,"These are not great books. The Wheel of Time is not art or literature. What it is is a great adventure. If you like magic, battles, loads of detail, etc. you will enjoy this series.I don't love The Wheel of Time or hate it, but I have invested a lot of time into it so far, and I am going to continue reading it until it is over.Please stop comparing Jordan to Tolkein. Its not even close. Tolkein had a story with a beginning and end in mind. Robert Jordan just keeps adding layer upon layer onto this series to keep the franchise going.Be honest. Has this series ever won a major Fiction award? Do critics ever include these books in best of lists?These books are the male equivalent of Romance novels. Trashy fun."
5,"Lord of Chaos, Robert Jordan. Wheel of Time series","As usual with Robert Jordan I enjoyed the book from start to finish, his story telling is consistent and follows on from previous books seamlessly. a very entertaining series which I find difficult to put down. The only problem I have is knowing which book follows next as they are not numbered in any order in the Amazon ordering system. all in all very good if like sword and sorcery fantasy type books, the series has a few twists that keep you guessing plus a little tongue in cheek humor that brings a smile. 10 out of 10."
4,Lord of Chaos: Book Six of the Wheel of Time,"After five books, I'm totally sucked into the story. Its a fun read. Great imagination and character development. I've seen reviews for the next 3 books and they aren't as good. I'm hoping that isn't true, but by now I'm heavily invested in the story so will see it all the way through, one way or another."
2,Series Getting Worse and Worse,"The first two or three books of this series are terrific: detailed, well-written, intriguing, etc. However, since then, I find myself reading trashy, money-driven novels at the end of which, one of the many ""bad guys"" is killed. I bought the first six ... now I think I'll just sit down and skim them over a few hours. The series looks to go for another five or six books.... In other words, Jordan will be raking in the dough for at least ten more years. This particular book was lousy - the plot does not advance very far, the writing is poor, and the character development is virtually non-existent."
2,"Poor book, but you need to read it to get through the series","I really didn't like this one, that title character does seam very pointless and I hope he doesn't come back in later books. I only really want you to read this because it will get you to the later book which seems to be to be back on track. Just grit your teeth and read. To me Robert Jordan is the master of the Fantasy (living master) but I think he lost the plot a little on this one, maybe fame went to his head"
3,"Robert Jordan ""Wheel of Time"" Series, hardcover","I ordered all the books in this series, then decided to resell them to local bookstore, as the dust-jackets are so garish, they stand out on my bookshelves like a sore thumb; I've read all but the last book and have been disappointed in the inconsistency or quality of the story line, though I have enjoyed this series very much for the most part; the books are large and heavy and it's impossible to get book one (at an affordable price), so I could not complete the set without resorting to the Kindle volume"
3,Frustrating ...,"I had some troubles reading this book, since practically every single female character is so mean and BITCHY.It makes you feel sorry for the male characters because they have to put up with these frustratingly stubborn and unreasonable women. I absolutely hate Faile. Nynaeve comes a very close second after Faile; Egwene and Elayne are tied for third place. Although the story is good, I would have been happier if there was more action. Unfortunatly, it is not the book that I can't put down."
3,Not his best,"Readers of any book in this series will appreciate the color and detail that Jordan imparts into the peoples, countries, cities, and politic. But, while I have deeply enjoyed all of the Wheel of Time series, I find this book moves more slowly than most of the others. I felt that he spent too much time on minor sub-plots without developing others which had previously been implied as crucial to the overall tale, making the story drag."
5,A Great Read,"I have been a huge Robert Jordan fan since the beginning of the Wheel of Time books. I can't say enough about how much I have enjoyed reading and now re-reading this series. I'm very saddened that we lost Mr. Jordan. His genius will be sorely missed. Keep reading the series, my friends, it's worth it!!!Book 6 is the first ebook version of the series I have read. I'm not real happy with the Kindle version of this book however. There are a HUGE number of typos and punctuation errors in it. I compared ebook six to the hardback book and the typos are not in the hardback version. Very poor proofreading there. Oh well, everyone makes mistakes. Hopefully, this will not be the trend."
5,The struggle to unite the nations for the Last Battle,"Book Six of Robert Jordan's ""The Wheel of Time"" series, Lord Of Chaos is a two cassette, 2.75 hour, digitally mastered, abridged audiobook that continues the story of Rand al'Thor and his struggle to unite the nations for the Last Battle when the Dark One will break free into the world to spring the snares laid by the immortal forsaken to the detriment of an unwary humankind. Robert Jordan is an accomplished and original author whose popularity increases with every title he writes. Highly recommended, this flawless audiobook production is enhanced with the narrative talent of Mark Rolston."
5,and we just kept walking... and walking... and walking....,"I liked this book alot. Thats the long and the short of it. It had its slow moments, it isnt a page flipper like eye of the world was, but i greatly enjoyed it. The ending rocked... Anyway, some people think this series is getting too drawn out. I dont think so at all. Its great writing!"
5,Very High Quality,"First of all, THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A MOUNTING BRACKET! For the first time ever, I didn't read reviews here before purchasing and bought a separate mounting bracket which Amazon lists as ""frequently purchased together"". On the flip side though, I doubled up the brackets to make them a bit more sturdy. The bracket will bend backwards from the force of pushing the 7 pin plug in otherwise.The adapter itself is made of a thick plastic so corrosion shouldn't be an issue. Both covers work well and should keep out the elements though dielectric grease should be used as well. The wires are heavy (enough) gauge and have good jackets to them and the included crimp connectors are a nice bonus, though I always recommend soldering them.My only complaint is the cheap screws that come with it. Everything needed to mount it is included but it's very soft steel and strips with little effort. Do yourself a favor and pick up some nice stainless screws at least for where it mounts to the vehicle."
5,Awesome Forest Garden,"This book is incredible and could very well change your life!Unlike other works on permaculture and ecological agriculture, which discuss simple principles derived from ecology, Jakce dives into the real workings of forest ecology and humanity's role (and potential role) in this ecology.While technically impressive, the real merit of this book is the quality of writing. It reads like a novel while conveying complex ecological ideas and their practical application.It truly offers hope for a beautiful and delicious post-petroleum food production system.Check it out now!And then get gardening like the forest!!"
3,"Good, but Kundera has better","This is a good book. I would recommend ""Identity"" and ""Ignorance"" befor this one, however."
5,fascinating tragic ... wonderful,"might be this is the book that will change your life by ita wisdom. full of tragic fun, never let you just stay reading without moving your imagination. god! this fantastic magic-realist made me very very impressed. i suggest you reader to read another kundera's book: ""immortality"", ""life is elsewhere"", and of course ""testament of betrayal""."
4,Thought provoking.,"This is the first 'book' :) I've read by Milan Kundera, and I love it. It took me a while to read this book, not because it's slow, but because I had to stop to think. The section on 'Litost' is extraordinary. I strongly recomend it."
3,Repetitive Themes Make for a Flat Read,"I was excited to jump into Kundera's novel after reading his masterpiece, ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"", but was disappointed by the repetitive themes and the flat character development. Kundera is a master storyteller and is arguably one of the greater writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, but I was expecting more. I will go on to read his other novels, but I will be more cautious with my expectations."
1,"Too verbose, and not very helpful","I've hated this book. I am an experienced programmer, with little database experience. I like my technical books to be brief and to the point. I started reading the PL/SQL guide with a few simple questions: how can I write a stored procedure, what is a calling convention, where are they stored inside the DB. Skimming the book to find answers to these did not work, and the book was way too verbose (pages of common-sense stuff tangential to PL/SQL, such as ""you should write as little code as possible"", ""Make comments easy to enter and maintain"").If you are looking to get going quickly, Urman's book is much better."
5,This book is the STANDARD,"Steve has a deep understanding of the development process, and get into the minds of most programmers. With that, he has continued to keep up the Standard in PL/SQL text. I have the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions, they invaluable texts to anyone doing PL/SQL."
3,Nice Book; Some Organization Limitations,"I got this book based on other reviews here. For the most part, I agree that this is a good book, and it has been helpful for me.However, for someone who has never done Oracle and needing to do Triggers specifically, I find it difficult to find any information about how to do Triggers, special contstucts available for Triggers, etc.Other technical topics are good, though, and as a novice it helps me greatly to see potential for Oracle application programming.Index and TOC could be better organized; I usually can't find what I'm looking for in the index."
2,Trinity Is Still My Name,If you like the old Spagetti Westerns this is bottom of the barrel. Something to watch when you need to waste time.
3,A Time Machine,Deniece and Johnny did two albums together if I'm correct. You might listen to this album and find most of its content corny. But in era that it came out it was probably really good at the time. Of course the vocals are excellent hence the three stars.
5,THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!,"Many titles today are billed as Christian Fiction; however no other book have I been fortunate enought to read that I can say I really felt the power of the Holy Spirit while reading. Kendra, the author, captivates you from page one to the very end! I couldn't put it down. When I HAD to work I was day dreaming about Grace and Greg and even crazy Derrick wondering what was going to happen next. My favorite part was when Greg took Grace to church and she gave her testimony! My eyes were filled with tears and the hairs on my arms were raised! It spoke volumes to me about how God is still a miracle worker today! So awesome Kendra! May God bless you in all your new endeavors! I'm excited about your new work, A Love So Strong, and can't wait to see what happens with Grace & Greg in your third novel! To God be the glory! Write on, my sistah!"
3,good book but not great,"I have read several of Kendra Norman Bellamy's books and I could tell this was an early work. While the story line was cute the character were sometime a little boring and predictable but putting that aside it was refreshing and light. There should have been more research done as the limitation of a medical resident. There is no hospital in American who employs a physician to do brain surgery, diagnosis and treat abdominal illness in the ER and cast broken bones. Medicine is much to specialized. If I have read this book first I may have liked it more but after reading 3:57 A.M, The Morning After and Fifteen Years I do she has developed and matured as a writer and this was her starting point."
3,ER or Law and Order?,"Another book that my soro sister from Atlanta sent me. Here is yet another Christian romance novel on the story of forgiveness. Some of the dialogues were flat and lifeless with no feeling. I found it distasteful and insensitive that the two mothers, especially Jessi's mom, were arguing while Jessi was lying on her deathbed. The front cover is appealing, but the characters are somewhat underdeveloped. The story moves slow, but it can be read relatively quickly. It was an okay read as far as Christian love stories go, and very predictable. It kind of reminded me of a Cinderalla story...and they lived happily ever after. This is pure fiction romance and not a true to life novel. I'm glad the author brought closure to the characters because a sequel would be overkill. All in all, for a debut novel, FLAG was a courageous effort."
3,Not Bad,"Our church bookclub just reviewed this book and we give it a 3***. It wasn't bad, but we had an interesting discussion. We enjoy reading romance novels and the most enjoyable romance novel so far to this date that we read is a book called ""Promises Beyond Jordan."""
5,An award winning effort,"I think what I liked most about this book was the romance between Greg and Grace. It was so very romantic, although it was almost secondary to the theme of the friendship between Greg and Derrick. The strong male presence and the bond between the men and their mothers was a refreshing tone. The characters of Greg and Grace made for a different kind of dramatic love story fit for a BET movie or modern-day black stage play fit for a Tony Award."
2,Defective battery holder door,"I do like this trash can, EXCEPT for the poorly fitted door to the battery holder. If I move the trash can, or if someone accidentally bumps it, the door becomes dislodged, and the batteries shift, losing their contact points. As a result, the can is no longer a ""touchless"" one. There is no damage to the door--it's just a defect in the engineering and production. There's no way to exchange it, as the postage to return it would cost too much. I've resorted to taping not only the door, but also the batteries. It is an annoying workaround. For this reason, I cannot recommend paying the price for this can unless you buy it locally and return it if yours, too, is defective."
1,Don't buy this CD-Rom,"This ""Reference"" consists only of a CD-Rom with 130 MB and a very small booklet which concentrates on how to use the CD. The online reference on the CD claims to be a complete listing of all Java Classes and Packages, but without any example it's not as valueable as expected. Unfortunatly the surely required copy-protection causes a denial of service, when you try to copy all the files to your harddrive. This is a certain drawback, when you want the reference to be quickly available. No detailed reference, really."
1,Don't bother ordering these,"The listing picture is not representative of the product. It is made out of hard plastic, and it is thick. The result is that it extends into the wheel well by about an inch!Because of the photo, I was expecting something that fits tight against the back of the wheel well and wraps around the body a little bit. I was surprised to see that this mounts against the back of the well but extends so far into the wheel well."
2,I wouldn't recommend this book..,"I purchased this book to be used as a reference book. I already had our SBS up and running (and even if I didn't, I don't think this book would have helped too much). The book goes on and on about the features of Small Business Server and how easy it is for the administrator to set up and maintain (the book does this for at least a hundred pages). I believe knowing about all of the features are important, but the book lacks in not showing the reader how to troubleshoot and inplement most of them. Some of the features that I was trying to implement were advanced but not out of the ordinary. This book didn't halp me at all.I have read many text books in my days. I felt that this book was the worst purchase I have made in a long time. This book wouldn't be that bad if the reader was never going to set up the server, but wanted to know what the server could do."
1,Inside ATL but not the outside,"I tried to read through this book in relation to the creation of ActiveX controls I however found information missing and holes in what was there. I ended with alot more questions that answers. A number of subjects ended with the reader having to come to there own conclusion without the book drawing the conlusion for you. This spends most of its time explains in detail how COM does this etc and why, but never how to use ATL on the outside. I found trying to use this book to write a simple project painfull and confusing. Internals it might have but as a explation of how to use ATL forget it. Its internals information is not even that good."
1,Took WAY too long to ship.,"I needed this book by a certain date for school and I was told it was Free 2-Day Shipping. I didn't come for like 2 months, after I had moved and started law school. Totally defeated the purpose. I still don't know what took it so long."
1,Disappointed - Very Disappointed,"I've always loved Canon digital cameras, so I was sure that I would also love a Canon printer. Sadly, I've never been so unhappy with anything as I am with this mini260 printer. After less than six months, of light to medium use, the printer seems to be worn out. I am faced with either replacing the print head (which Canon happily tells me may not solve the problem), or replacing the printer completely. Further, I have found that the ink cartridges are nearly impossible to find locally (so I order them from amazon), the paper is very expensive locally, and the printer is picky about using only Canon paper. Other papers give very poor print results. The user interface is very 'clicky', and I'm not impressed with the feel of the printer - it's very lightweight and fragile-feeling. Before I purchased this canon printer, I used an HP photoprinter (one of the first) for YEARS and was very happy. Guess what I am about to do now ?"
3,Loses two stars for leaving out the Comedy Roast,"I really enjoy this series (flaws and all) but I was also disappointed that they left the ""roast"" off the set. I bought the set immediately because I was not able to see the complete roast when it aired, but apparently they've decided to release it separately or something.I still enjoy the show, but leaving the roast off the DVD set was a dud decision."
5,Excellent!,Samurai and the Tea was not only historically accurate but kept my interest from beginning to end. Cathy Brueggemann Beil has an extraordinary talent for writing! After reading the book myself I am now reading it to my children. What an incredible way to learn about the beautiful legacy of the Japanese Christians! I look forward to her next book!
3,Buddhist Boy Wonder,"This books probably isn't the best place to start for someone just becoming interested in either Alan Watts or in Eastern thought in general. However, for osmeone who is interested in Alan Watts, it is invaluable. It shows him just coming into his own as a writer - most of them were written when he was in his late teens and early twneties, and shows him strruggling to devlop his style and the finer points of his philosophy. THe introductory material is especially helpful"
3,Not sufficient for exam,"I have little experience with SQL Server 7. After taking a class and reading a book, I then used the Readiness Review to determine whether I was ready for the exam. According to my scores on the Review, I was ready. But the exam I took did not look anything like the questions in the book. The exam was far more difficult than what I expected based on this book. So it's back to studying... both BOL and yet another book on SQL Server admin."

2,religious connotations,"I bought this book for my 1 year old daughter because we love our Margaret Wise Brown books: Goodnight Moon, The Big Red Barn, and Runaway Bunny. I found the style of this one to be very different and was upset by the last page, which is obviously a Christian prayer. If you are Christian then this might be fine, perhaps ideal, but we do not practice religion in our home so I was a bit put off. I'm a little sensitive about this subject though so take it for what it's worth. Not as good as her other books IMO."
3,Beware of the hardback edition,I remembered this book from my son's childhood and decided to reorder it since I could not find my copy. We originally had the paperback which is how I remember the illustrations. The hardback copy has reformatted the images such that the borders cut off some of the illustrations - or to me it looks as if they have. The illustrations look cramped. It takes away from the relaxing ambiance of the book. I'm picky about artwork so I will be ordering the paperback as well which seems to have a larger frame for the illustrations.
4,"good content, bad CDs","This is an excellent resource. You will need some dictionary to be able to spell the words correctly, but the lessons are very well done.The only problem is that the CDs are pretty bad. They don't work very well in my CD players so I eventually had to copy them to my computer's hard-drive and burn new CDs from that. Now they work fine."
4,More please!,"Being a fan of the B grade movies that get shown in the annual Incredibly Strange Film Festival, this book was an obvious purchase and I wasn't disappointed. There is a feast of all that's good and bad about these movie genres. The reproduction is superb and the selection thoughtful. My only criticism is that there is no logic and probably only the author's personal preference as to how big or small each poster gets presented - on some pages there is only one poster, on others there are 5 - I would have preferred one per page, but I guess that would have more than doubled the price. I only hope that there will be a second volume soon!"
5,Filled with fun!,"This is a book filled with fun and useful ideas that will keep both children and adults busy for hours! Loaded with handy tips to get the most ""craft-fun"" out of your computer and printer. I love her instructions for turning a plain, inexpensive wall clock into a treasured gift for any occasion - for adults or children. Stickers, t-shirts, bookmarks - this book is loaded with wonderful projects and Kay Hall takes us step-by-step through each one. I highly recommend this book. Children need not be bored on rainy days anymore."
1,Not intelligent at all.,"1 1/2 - 2 weeks after receiving the intellicord unit it failed. The unit's indicators lights were functioning but it did not power-up my whistler xtr 695se radar. Luckly, I was able to fall back on the original power cord for the radar to function properly. I am really surprised the failed unit didn't even make it passed the 30 day mark. I am in the process of returning the intellicord back to the seller(antonline_com). So far no issues from them at this point."
1,Sad come-back. Fans avoid!,"I am a huge ELP fan, but there's a limit, and this is past that limit. (In the Hot Seat, the follow-up, is even worse.) Greg Lake's once awesomely beautiful and powerful voice is a ruin. It's shot; it's gone. The amazing classically-inspired construction of their earlier songs is gone, too. Instead we get horrible, cheesy MOR ballads. They can still play, but music this ordinary isn't worth playing. This isn't ELP; this is a ghastly OAP stage band, three guys who happen to have the same names. The real ELP died no later than the much (and on the whole justly) maligned ""Love Beach"". And even ""Love Beach"" had a few sparks left (the Rodrigo cover, bits of ""Officer and Gentleman"") of a once huge talent. But here the fire is out. I love ELP, but I love truth more.Laon"
4,Exellent ADO resource,All the references to ADO is at your finger tips. A very handy book to have on your shelve.
5,Great reference and bedside reading :),"An alternative title could have been ""ADO 2.0 in a nutshell"".It reads as though it was written by a serious ADO user for another ADO user. I've not seen a better summary of the ADO object model anywhere. The sections on data shaping, command parameters are a hell of a lot better than the online documentation. The section of performance alone was worth the price of the book.What can I say?Get this book."
3,Not much more than online docs,"As its name implies, this is just a reference book. It mostly lists the interfaces and their methods and properties. It is barely more than the docs available from MS."
5,Excellent Reference for ASP Programmers,"My thoughts fall in line with the Visual Basic programmers who have posted their opinions on this book. I do a lot of ASP development,and I have found that after reading Wrox's Professional Active Server Pages 2.0, I know most of what ASP can be used for. However, I do need a reference to look at when I am trying something new with recordsets. This is where this slim tome excels. It tells me what I need to know - but, it doesn't take up any more real estate on my desk than it needs to. Another excellent work from Wrox, my favorite publisher along with O'Reilly."
4,Something new,"Eric's music has progressed wonderfully. This Cd is full of ecletic guitar licks and innovative arrangements. Many different types of music are showcased on this album creating a thoughtful and out-of-the-ordinary musical experience. After listening to this album, one can honestly say that there is no other musician that comes close to playing and writing music like Eric."
2,Clearly written but predictable.,"Picoult certainly raises valid questions, and she writes in a nice clear style. However, the plot to this book is made up of equal parts of ""Agnes of God"", ""Nell,"" ""Contact"" and a little-remembered suspense novel called ""Baby"". In other words, there's nothing new under the sun. If you liked this book, you might want to watch ""Agnes of God"" if you haven't seen it. It is a beautifully photographed and superbly acted film that handles the same themes and questions."
4,Keeping Faith,Very sweet love story. Held my attention and wasn't quite sure how it would end. I hate being able to figure out the ending half way through the book.
3,Not the best Picoult,I have read most of her books but this one was a little to weird and hard to believe. Too much like scifi
3,Ended abruptly,"I love most of Jodi Picoult's books but this had some unrealistic characters and was quite predictble, The end (if you could call it that) left me disappointed.....She didn't let us know what happened to Faith just left you hanging wondering what became of the whole story line. I would have recommended it until the end but I was disappointed she didn't really end it. I thought I was missing pages. Very disappointed!"
5,Deeply moving and real,"This book is wonderful and, yet, emotionally draining, but in a good way. The characters were so real.I was simply overwhelmed with her writing. It was just a nearly perfect book."
4,Pageturner!,"I just finished this book by Jodi Picoult. I read two of her books, ""Mercy"" and ""The Pact"", and although they were both very readable, I felt a little unsettled by the overall topics, and decided that I didn't need to read any of her other books. I'm glad I received ""Keeping Faith"" and decided to give it a try.What a great book! Faith is the 7 year old daughter of Mariah White, a 32 year old woman that is in the middle of a painful divorce. As she begins to settle into life as a single mother, her daughter starts to talk about seeing her ""guard"". Miraculous things start to happen to others when Faith is around. Of course, then the media and the clergy must investigate these claims, and create an ensuing scandal.The story is told in a very interesting way, through journal-like dated entries and frequent changes of point of view. I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it as one of my favorites of the year. I now look forward to reading more books by this author."
4,"God, in a new light","Jodi Picoult's book ""Keeping Faith"" made me think about my own religious beleifs in a new light. It also taught me some things about different faiths that I didn't know. The amount of research that goes into her books is amazing. I highly recommand any book writen by this author."
2,Not Picoult's Best,"I'll start this review by saying, like many other reviewers, I am a big Jodi Picoult fan. I have read about 7 of her books, and I just finished Keeping Faith. Normally, Picoult writes a captivating story that keeps me enthralled. But with this one, I was turning the pages just to get through it. I found the characters unlikeable, except for little Faith, and the story never really went anywhere. Most of the middle section of the book was unnecessary, as well as the random forays into the stories of a multitude of minor characters, including numerous religious clergy and a guardian ad litem we barely got to know. The story didn't get interesting until the last third, and the ending was a big let down. If you are a Jodi Picoult fan, I suggest skipping this one. She has far better books that will keep you wildly entertained, such as Nineteen Minutes, My Sister's Keeper, Plain Truth, and Second Glance."
2,Disapointing read,"I had several recomendations for this book and was anxious to read it. I was disapointed in the writing and the progression of the story. I found the story compelling in the beginning, but it lagged in the middle and turned too much into a ridiculous romance and less about the relationship between the mother and child. In the beginning, the mother was insecure, unsure of herself in her marriage and in her role of a mother...She was real and I related to her insecurities. However, as the book progressed and the more confident she became the less interesting and the less real she and the book became. I felt the character development was lacking and created an enviornment that I didn't really care about most of the characters, anyway. Finally, the medical information was innacurate, it could have easily come off a TV medical drama. I did find the concept to be interesting and it was a quick read."
2,tedious,"The only Jodi Picoult book I've been unable to finish. It went back and forth and back and forth about the differences between the Catholic and Jewish faiths until I just shut the Kindle off and said ""enough"""
5,Keeping Faith,"I thoroughly enjoyed Keeping Faith,right up there with Jodi Picoult's previous high standard,this kept me, glued to my Nexus tablet to the final word.This is the first time I've read an eBook, and I'm hooked.Thanks Amazon."
5,A bit of a surprise,"I tend to purchase ebooks that are on special, aren't expensive and they mount up and by the time I finally read them I forget why I got them in the first place.I liked this book. It took a while to get into it, but once I did I was very interested in what was going to happen next. It has a marriage collapsing, a woman who practically worshipped a husband who didn't deserve it. And a little girl who seems to have an imaginary friend....but ends up being much more."
4,Fascinating,"It really makes you think about what could possibly be happening to this girl... and challenges what your belief is in Faith as a religion, or Faith wrapped up in this little girl."
4,Another great work by Jodi Picoult,"A very intriguing and thought provoking story. Try otherstories from this author such as The Pact and Harvesting the Heart...Ihave enjoyed all of this authors novels, however, the older titles are out of print and hard to find... END"
2,Saved by the end,Jodi is my favorite author but this was not my favorite book. Normally I can't put her books down but this one was different....it is still a decent book the last few chapters had me hooked. But it as mostly a very slow read
1,starfire37,This story was a bit too far off the wall for me. It did not hold my interest and I felt as though I was struggling to keep reading.
4,A Young Girl Speaks to God,"This book is well-written and a page-turner. It is also about a controversial subject as are most of the Jodi Picoult books I have read.Faith is a little girl who has been recently traumatized by her parents' divorce. She begins to talk to her 'guard', has visible stigmata and can bring the dead back to life. Even those who are disbelievers, believe that Faith is the real thing. The characterizations of Faith, her father, her mother, her grandmother, etc. are all very well done.The plot is interesting and tantalizing. This book has several sub-plots. The one I enjoyed most was the one about the mother's love interest. The book offers a lot of food for thought and is not one you'll soon forget.I highly recommend this book. However, don't start reading it right before you go to bed because it is a real page-turner and you're likely to be up all night!"
1,I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK - Audiobook.,"You can read other reviews for the plot.What an awful book.I should have known when I was reading it that something completely outlandish was going to happen toward the end.I didn't even enjoy the book, just kept thinking it could get better."
2,Don't go for it....,You can't use it with iTrip.. You have to remove your iPod out of the case everytime you want to use iTrip. :(Hence it is as good as not having the case at all...
4,Great case for any iPod,"This is an excellent case for anyone who owns a 4th generation iPod. It provides excellent scratch and fingerprint protection to the surface as well as superior shock protection.Pros: Awesome overall protection against damage, rubber grips prevent slipping, fits in with iPod style and design.Cons: Top opening not compatible with certain FM transmitters and voice recorders, white case attracts dirt and fingerprints (get it in black to avoid this), adds some bulk to the iPod, not compatible with the iPod Nano or iPod mini."
4,Highly recommended,"""Live Wire"" is a very good movie, a must for all Pierce Brosnan fans. There was a lot of violence, but it's a movie about violence, so I suppose it's to be expected. If you liked Brosnan before he was Bond, then get this video."
4,A great tool for devotions with a whole lot of typos,I found this to be a wonderful addition to my prayer life. The morning and evening prayers have helped me branch out on the way I pray. The prayers in the book vary quite a bit on their focus which was really fun for me. I even bought this book for my dad.That being said it is obvious this kindle book was just a scan and that nobody bothered to proof it. There are quite a few typos and this is made worse by the text being older english. I have found myself on a couple of occasions looking words up because I am not sure if they are a misspelling or some old word that I haven't encountered before. It has always been the former. It is pretty frustrating when a simple read through would have eliminated most of the errors.I would encourage anyone to buy this and use it in there prayer time.
5,Great English Humor,"If you enjoy John Cleese and English humor, this is a wonderful set. I recalled watching a few shows 25 years ago and then learned I could buy the entire set. My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed the shows -- lots of laughs!!"
5,One of the funniest shows ever!,"As many others have noted, Fawlty Towers is a truly hilarious series. The only show I can think of that's funnier (to me) is ""Arrested Development"" and it took 25 years for any comedy series to surpass FT. Every episode is a gem, but my favorite is ""Gourmet Night."" The scene where Basil goes berserk and starts thrashing his car with a tree branch is just one of the funniest TV moments EVER! I bought the series on VHS tape years ago, and I'd upgrade to the DVD set if were more reasonably priced. Three bucks an episode is a bit steep for 30-year-old TV episodes; most US series go for about half that. Still, FT is a classic, and there are some decent extras on this set. If I didn't already own it on tape I'd probably spring for it."
4,The Classic Comedy,"Okay, I know I've only given it four stars. You see, it's not that I don't like Fawlty Towers. I agree, it's a rare comedy that survives so long, and is still funny. It's just that I've seen these all so many times now, that it's kind of like looking at a photo of a favourite place.You see a clip, you know the episode instantly, you know the jokes instantly. If you watch the episode, you know what will happen. Yes, it is funny. Yes, there are episodes that I'll watch again, but there are still moments that I'll hit the fast forward on, there are still scenes which I find embarrasing (for some reason).This means that the entire series collection becomes more of a monument than a watchable purchase. It is a classic. I don't know of a series that ended just at the right time like this did, that retains its charm even now. I do sing its praises...it's just that I can't watch them like I used to."
4,the main problem with the audio commentaries,"You hear lots of constricted breathing, swallowing, phlegm swishing, slurping of drinks, scratching or other playing with oneself for sometimes minutes at a time, chain smoking sounds, clogged nasal passages, etc. It's truly revolting, and I'm glad I got through them all and plan never to turn the commentaries on again. (This information got lost from my first review attempt.)"
5,John Cleese is brilliant!,"This series revolves around John Cleese and his ability to perform both physical comedy and screaming hysterics. On both levels it works extremely well. Basil Fawlty is just not a nice person. He hits the porter. He berates the maid. The belittles the guests. And, he back stabs his wife. A role model for all politically correct people. And, no one can pull it off like John Cleese.Bea Arthur tried an Americanized version, as did the great John Larroquette. Neither worked because Americanized may as well mean watered-down. No one is willing to be as nasty as is needed to pull off what John Cleese did so effortlessly."
4,Hilarious show,"For anyone who loves Monty Python or British comedy in general, Fawlty Towers is absolutely worthwhile. John Cleese is hilarious as always, this time playing an over-stressed, henpecked hotel manager. The supporting cast is wonderful as well. I would highly reccomend this collection."
5,British comedy,"British comedy can't be beat. Fawlty Towers is among the best, others being To The Manor Born, and Good Neighbors. This is a great collection, and I'll be watching it many times over."
4,"Timely arrival, but doesn't look like the picture","It arrived really quickly, but it looks completely different from the picture.... the description appears to be the same on the box as what the seller described, but I was just surprised that the picture is not accurate. And the back says ""DISC MADE IN MEXICO"" which also makes me nervous, but was unopened and appears to be in good working order."
5,Excellent!!!,"I knew this was great before I purchased it; I'm just glad to get the complete series, short though it is, in one shot. I'm introducing my 13-year-old to English humor and might as well start with the best of the best. Well worth the money."
5,Duh,"It's Fawlty Towers or Watery Towels or a number of other things :) It's a great addition to anyone's collection of humor, not just British humor. It is a must see, even after all these years, wish there were more than 12 episodes?"
5,Great seris of British comedy,"I first bought this set of the complete Fawlty Towers episodes collection about six years ago. I have watched these tapes many times and never fail to find them totally hilarious! My younger cousins who come over to visit often ask for these to watch on the television rather than cartoons!Buy them - you will not regret it. All the characters, including the bit-over-the top John Cleese, succeed in keeping you laughing through most of each episode. Slapstick, yes, but such enjoyable slapstick!"
5,"A ""Must Have"" Addition to Your Viewing Library","Fawlty Towers has to rank as one of the very finest, and funny, British Sitcoms ever produced. The writing and acting are without peer and unfortunately not found in the great majority of what passes as TV comedy shows today. The material is not dated and depends upon sight gags more often than not. You will find it very hard not to have a marathon session with Fawlty and his gang of hotel help....enjoy ! Ed Sponable, Falls Church, VA"
5,Hilarious!,"Just as funny as I remember from watching it as a kid. When Basil picked up Manuel and carried him into the kitchen, I just about lost it, as did my 15 year old son. Great TV (and I mean some of the greatest ever!), and excellent quality FAMILY entertainment. I'm SO glad I purchased this!"
1,damaged merchandise,"When I received the rifle case it was cracked and when I called the customer service rep, she informed me that the rifle cases are back ordered and I would not have a replacement before christmas (this was weeks before christmas). The rep told me she would send a shipping label for me to return the item and never told me how long it would take (i found out later that it takes 5 -7 business days for the label to be shipped and it took all of 7 business days). So even if the merchandise wasn't on back order, I still wouldn't have had a replacement on time. Needless to say my husband is going to get a damaged rifle case for Christmas because the whole ordeal of sending this back has been nothing but a hassle. Also note that the customer service rep who answered my call was very unpleasant and uninterested in my dilemma. Wouldn't recommend buying anything from this company."
3,Ok for regular rifle...,"The case is ok. But I had to return it since its a tight fit for my AR-15. But the construction, the locks, and the overall quality is worth the money and the Amazon Price and customer service is hard to beat."
5,Awesome,I love the relaxing music it is wonderful when you just need to relax and shut out all the other noise this is a great CD I listen to it as I am going to sleep it takes to another place that is calming! Luv it!!
1,One Word....Rubbish. Guys please retire.,"I have to admit I love Oasis, but since Heathen Chemistry, they have hit rock bottom. This is the worst CD Oasis has made to date. It's uninspired garbage, poor vocals and standard arrangements. If this is the best they have to offer these days, they should live off the royalties from the early stuff and retire."
5,"Dual Disc, an enhanced way to enjoy the music!","Hi,I am satisfied about the Dual Disc I bought. That's why in Italy I haven't seen this new standard yet and at this good price. The little bad thing is that I waited 1 month in order to get it."
4,Different but good.,"Don't expect to hear a modern electric guitar wall of sound that you would typically hear from them.They've reinvented themselves a bit.Its not that bad, in fact its quite good album, it takes a while to get used to it, condsidering that this is Oasis.Ther are not huge songs like ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" ""Wonderwall"" or ""Live Forever"", but every track on the album matters and that makes for their best album since ""Whats the Story Morning Glory"" despite sounding nothing like they've ever done."
3,It Ain't That Bad,"I give this album 3.5 stars. It's a good album but definitely not their best. The album starts off great with a good rockin' and sing-along song, ""Turn Up the Sun"" But the following song ""Mucky Fingers"" is just plain...""plain"". The last third of the album is quite good and darn right mesmerizing at times. ""Keep The Dream Alive"" hits one out of the park in the 7th inning stretch. It has a super catchy chorus with lyrics to back it up. Noisy but in a good way; a-la songs from the album Be Here Now.As stated before there are some low points and a few fillers on this album but don't let this distract you from the finer points and subtlety that makes this album better than most other rock bands have put out in the last 5-7 years."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Is modern-day rock music so bad that we give this sub-par effort five stars? Answer me one question...where are the melodies? Each song meanders through an aural wasteland just to end on a sour note. This album continues the downward spiral of Heathen Chemistry and will be the undoing of the band. They should have stopped while on top with their excellent overlooked album, ""Standing on the Shoulders of Giants"". I am glad I only paid $9.95, because I might as well have just thrown my money away. A huge disappointment!"
2,Lost Their Sound,"The thing I have always loved about Oasis is the big wall of sound evedent in their early albums. It was raw energy. Unfortunately they started losing the ""wall of sound"" on Heather Chemistry, and it is completely gone on this offering. This is their weakest, most uninspired album to date. My copy came with an extra disc that contains live tracks recorded in '95. Listening to the two, there is no comparison. The energy has left the band. Too bad..."
1,Not very good at all I'm afraid.,"Boring, dull and lifeless, basically its Oasis's version of 1960s rock n roll which has been and gone and has its place, but we need good modern music not rehashed crap.What a dissaponitment, their was'nt an actual bad Oasis album yet until ""don't beleive the truth"", it sounds nothing like the proper Oasis that everyone has come to know and love and is by no means a neccessary album to have in youe collection.A total waste of time and money."
5,Great Rock and Roll album,When I first listened to this CD (and I'm a huge Oasis fan) I didn't get it. After 3 or 4 listens I couldn't stop listening. What a great collection of songs. If you're an Oasis fan you will love this album. This is their Revolver and my second favorite Oasis Album. I truly believe Oasis has many more great albums ahead of them.
5,Engaging combination of personal experience and history,"Wheeler combines historical accounts of exploration with her own physical and emotional experiences. I found this book in a library, read it, purchased it and then re-read it. Her accounts of her experiences with scientists and their work are fascinating, and she made me laugh aloud several times. Her account of shared time at a remote site with an artist is an intriguing, interesting 'inside' picture of two artists sharing a unique environment, and contributing to each other's work. Her descriptions of her deeper reactions to the landscape are well done and left me realizing how difficult it must be to write well about such an experience"
1,Rather thin travel book,"Sarah's book could have been much better had she left her British haughtiness at home. Her fascination with Chilean political history takes a lot away from her usual travel insights. When she compared Allende's last days with that of Jesus Christ, his farewell the same as Jesus' farewell to his disciples, that becomes a little much. And of course, most of Chile's problems come from, where else, the US of A! Hitler, she observes, was the ""Nixon of that era."" She's just one of the people, she hints, but can't help but comment on how smelly some of the peasants are, and when a servant in a luxurious hacienda brings her a drink, she refers to him as a ""flunkey."" So, let her get back to her travel books with some pretty penetrating observations about people and place, and she'll do OK. But ""Travels in a Thin Country"" is pretty thin."
1,Ventures Beached in Hawaii,"This has all the titles,etc. of the originals, but in comparing the music to originals, I have to believe these are re-recordings by another artist.If you want originals, buy originals. This item did not offer samples of the tracks which is unfortunate, since I would not have ordered this CD if I could have heard it first."
4,Entertaining,"I got this for my husband for a Christmas gift. It is pretty entertaining. It is mostly just ""fluff"" T.V., but watching some of these guys whine and cry cracks me up. The ice road itself is pretty amazing. When it starts melting, I don't know how these guys keep driving on it to get in their last loads... Overall, I would recommend it."
2,Ice Road Truckers Season Two is a bust!,"Ice Road Truckers - The Complete Season 1 (History Channel)was a unique query into the phenomena of ""At The Top of The World"" ice road trucking. An eclectic group of ice road drivers, the bleeped out language, interaction between drivers and the sheer ""man vs the elements"" made for quite an enjoyable series.Season Two was a bit of a disappointment. The weeks depicting the gas drill rig being moved and reassembled was good but watching week after week of Hugh ""The Polar Bear"" driving a waste truck, Rick transporting dirty snow and Drew delivering candy & soda just killed the novelty of the whole series. I'll be taking a pass on Season Two!Ice Road Truckers: The Complete Season Threehas been a delight with the show moving to the USA. Notice that because this year has been in the US, all drivers are wearing seat belts; even our lovable Canadian drivers. Perhaps next season will be in the Asian Arctic. That would be ""cool""!"
5,A Masterpiece of Epic Proportions,"This movie is an adventure lovers dream. The acting, suspense, and drama keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. This movie tugs at the beliefs and tenets of the western mind as the white mand enters the fascinating world of Amazonia to try to reform these simple minded yet brilliant ""savages"". The irony occurs when the true ""savages"" are revealed. Highly recommended viewing. The cinematography is also spectacular."
3,ROFL,This is a great jig. Why pay the money for it though when you can make a better one yourself out of scrap in 20 mins.
3,Door Stand,"Great little stand to help when you are routering door hinges. Sturdy and lightweight. It also adjusts to various size door widths. Yes, of course you can make one, but this one does the trick."
2,"Digital ""remastering"" is horrible","This CD does not do Mr. Rifkin justice at all. It sounds like a cheap ""MIDI"" version of Rikin's playing - like a cheap $50 electric keyboard. Gone are the acoustic sound that can be heard on the concert grand that Rifkin's original recordings are played on. You're better off buying the ""UN-mastered"" original CD from Nonesuch Records. This is an insult to one of the greatest Joplin interpreters."
4,Humour in good taste? You'll find none of that here!,"It is a certainty that 99% of the populace would be repulsed, disgusted, horrified, sickened, and thoroughly unable to watch or appreciate this movie. If you're one of the 1% that can truly appreciate disgusting, black humour, you won't stop laughing anytime soon. This movie is totally devoid of anything resembling good taste, plumbing the depths of puppet depravity. Enjoy hours of tormenting your friends, parents, and others with this film."
5,Meet the Feebles was disturbing and artistic....I loved it!,"""Meet the Feebles"" was an excellent movie! Sure, this movie was quite odd, and if you ever showed it to a seven year-old child, they will probably be afraid of puppets for the rest of their life, but aside from that fact, it told a tale of a variety show's cast members that was compelling and shocking. A bunny with syphillis, a coke dealing and show producing walrus, a very evil rat, a sadist fox, a smack-addicted knife-throwing frog, an over-weight and depressed hippo, and a fly who eats feces and writes down every bit of gossip are just a few characters in this weird saga. The best parts of this movie was when Harry the Hare threw up on the organ. If you watch this movie, put the kiddies to bed first because this is the muppets on crack."
4,A sickly delight!,"Those of you who are familiar with Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" will love this movie. I guarantee it. Very similiar cinematogrophy and music, and a sick subject matter. When i first put the tape in and pressed play, i had no idea what to make. A bunch of puppets singing... yawn ... But once the backstage antics kick in, i was glued. The best scene in the film has to be the heroin junkie's NAM flashback. Absolutely hilarious! I will admit, there are some scenes that kinda dragged on and created no real interest for me, but those were few and far between compared to the ones that made me laugh with disgust. If you are Peter Jackson fan, BUY THIS FILM!"
1,A horrid tragedy of a movie,"This movie is in the worst taste I have ever seen. You should buy it just so you can see how truly bad a movie can be. It will offend absolutely anyone. I've seen this video twice. The first time, I swore I'd never see it again. The second time I remembered why."
2,AAAAAHHHHHH!,"To be fair, I can understand why people would enjoy this movie. It's a funny concept, there are some funny moments, and it's depraved, but in a funny sort of way. That's about where my appreciation of the movie stops. To be honest, I didn't find it offensive, just incredibly boring. Any one who has sat through a more mainstream entertainment, like 8mm for example, won't find it all that shocking in comparision. The only twist is that it's a puppet show, but even that isn't took shocking. In addition to finding it boring, I found to be pointless. What were they trying to achieve here? If this is a satire on children's entertainment, why not throw in a bright musical number? This could show how false and empty children's entertainment is, in contrast to how depraved this version of it is."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Rarely have I come across a movie as bad as Gummo, Dead Alive, Spice World, or Kazaam. Meet the Feebles however is truly terrible, and deserves its ranking as among the worst films I have had the misfortune to watch. I am not even going to bother reviewing it, suffice it to say that I would rather be kicked in the genitals than watch it again."
3,A strange experience.,"Of all the films Peter Jackson made in his early ""wacky B-movie"" period, this one is almost certainly the least accessible. The subject matter is very adult, the music is overpoweringly loud and obnoxious, the camera work is claustrophobic, and Jackson appears to be trying to make you throw up as often as possible. The end result of all this feels something like a movie equivalent to finger nails on a chalkboard. Still, it has it's moments, and if you're looking for something different and/or have always wondered what the Muppets would be like it they were NC-17, then look no further."
2,....wow....,my boyfriend talked about this movie all the time so i bought it for him and we watched it. some parts were ok but some were messed up..and i relly didnt like it...it was kinda dumb..and not the good kind of dumb...
1,"If I could give it no stars, I would","I'm sorry to all those who proclaim this to be one of the best ""twisted"" films they've seen; there is no possible way that I will be able to say one good thing about this incredibly sick, sick show. While I realize that everybody must try to expand their horizons, etc., etc., this movie went over the boundaries of decency and was just plain wrong. The disgusting bathroom humor, which is a major turn-on for some individuals, will not please most audiences. The innuendos and other sordid details are in extremely bad taste. Please rent this movie before you buy it; it might be right up your alley, but I hope not. I was dumber after seeing this movie."
5,Not for children,"It takes a very sick individual to enjoy this movie. Needless to say, I love it!This is a movie for adults, not children! I wouldn't show this to anyone under the age of 18!"
1,Do Not Purchase This Book,Do not purchase this book. I have completed seven chapters and have come across two clear errors in the review questions. Readers attempting to prepare for the Visual Basic 6.0 Distributed Applications exam must have accurate information in the text AND accurate answers to the review questions.
1,disappointment,This book is not even witten in Arabic. To use it I will have to learn a whole new transliteration system. It is useless for someone transitioning from classical Arabic to spoken arabic.
1,Crosley Stack Mate 45 Cartridge,"The Crosley Stack Mate 45 Cartridge dropped the records properly. However, the base of the cartridge that the records spin around is too large which created a drag, ie, the records do not spin freely. This caused them to sound distorted. Some would not even spin.I was very disappointed in this product."
4,Perfect for the closet wanderer!,"I enjoyed this book immensely. I often harbor the fantasy of taking off, no plans, no real goals, just the American expanse to explore. I think it takes a lot of courage to actually do it. Heat-Moon's story is beautiful. It is simple and real. He shares his feelings as his journey progresses. He also meets some real characters! I think every person is unique and eccentric in there own way and Heat-Moon recreates these people extremely well. If you are a closet wanderer... read this book, it will not disappoint you."
2,A Condescending Smirk at Rural America,"I tried to like this book, I really did. I started to read it when it first came out, in the 80s, and again recently, and I just didn't enjoy it. It reminds me of PBS specials where some Harvard-educated musicologist ventures into the swamplands to interview old bluesmen, and tell us all the deep socio-economic underpinnings of the lyrics. Forget it. It's just the blues - it's meant to be felt in your bones, not theorized about. ""Blue Highways"" gave me the same feeling. W.L.H.Moon comes off as self-centered and condescending; he seems to secretly pity those he meets, even as he wants us to chuckle knowingly at them. There are plenty of American travelogues written by people who actually live there. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Another smug outsider writing about the inside,"WLHM, although a decent writer, attempts to cross the brooding beat writers of a generation ago with Charles Kuralt. Moon fails miserably. There are some some passages of note, but mostly this work is brooding and pseudo-introspective and at times unfairly insulting to the people of whom he writes. As an English major and English teacher and a teacher of Appalachian literature, culture, history and traditions, I cannot recommend this work with any enthusiasm at all."
3,Blue Highways Sometimes wanders,"When I first started to read Blue Highways, I was expecting a travelogue but quickly realized that it was the story of man in search of what life is all about and how different people see and cope with life. The travel was interesting and so were the people he met along the way. However he wishes to give the impression that he is of the people but writes like he is way above them. At times I felt that I needed to read the book with a dictionary beside me. I would have liked him to come to some conclusions about his life by the end of the book."
3,Interesting,"Pretty good little movie here with some not too bad special effects. The storyis interesting, the acting passes and the story flows without too many dull moments. But as the movies is ending...one can feel that they are running out ofmoney as the movie ends pretty quick..but at least has a ending and does notpretend to be ready for a millions sequels...Worth watching .."
1,Be aware this book is anti-abortion,"I have not read this book but I am very familiar with the Standup Girl web site, and it is 100% anti-abortion. While I respect the right of the authors and the women who tell their stories in the book to be anti-abortion and even to try and persuade the rest of us against abortion, I think that the title 'Take Charge of Your Unexpected Pregnancy' might be misleading to some. If you are looking for a book that respects all your options - abortion, adoption and parenting - and your right to make your own decision, this isn't it."
5,Lil Britches,The book that captured my imagination the most when I was a child. My grandson loved it also.
5,More proof that the struggles of life produce its joys.,"My fifth grade daughter and I are completely captivated with Ralph Moody.This story of the struggles of a family moving to a ranch in Colorado at the turn of the century made us laugh and cry and long to know more.It teaches so much about life in America before there was any ""safety net."" Young Ralph had to be the hardest working lad in the area, but he had adventures and made friends anyone would envy.We were most struck by the way the family supported each other both materially and emotionally.Through their overwhelming struggles, they became strong and compassionate.We can't wait to read his other books!"
2,Perfect Memory,"Nothing enlightening here. Same old techniques that have been discussed for years, with some minor tweaks. Suggest the book where a gentleman participated in the memory contests and learned the techniques."
3,rasonable,"I think the book should help me with my memory problems. However, it not works very well... Maybe its my fault"
1,Corporate sponsorship of chapters ruins this book.,"The two highly respected experts, Goldfarb and Prescod, have seriously compromised their good reputations by putting their names on a book that is essentially a compendium of advertisements/position papers from SGML/XML vendors."
1,Useless,"An absolutely useless source for information on xml. The examples were not clear or useful, and the writing was too pretentious to read. I would not recommend this book, or any of the others in this series (i have read the others also- searching for something applicable)."
1,Very dissappointed!!!!!!,"I'm a senior programmer. I spent a whole night reading this book, but at the end, I'm still a stranger to XML. Totally lost! What a waste of my precious time! I should spent that time with my boyfriend watching movie......"
2,"Good for case studies, fails as tool",This book lacks a good index so it is virtually impossible to use it for finding specific advice when you work with a XML file.After a year or so I realised several pages are blank inside the book. I think this shows how much use this book was for me...
4,Excellent book to get the big picture,"This is an excellent book to get the big picture about XML, E-commerce, B2B and other applications. It might not be enough to learn all the code, but it is the best so far."
1,The great undefined 'XML',"horrible... unintelligible, written by people who like the look of their own words on paper, but these words lack content and scope. They're supposed to be two people who define documents, but their book layout is completely bunk, which scares me."
3,Not impressed,"I just passed 70-029, this was one of the books i bought for preparing, and the only one i didnt need. The questions are not representative for the real test, and not all are well worded. The real test is more clearly worded and much more difficult. This book is ok for testing your knowledge, and you can learn many things from it, but i found it to be bad use of valuable time."
2,Not good enough,I brought the book for my 028 and 029 examination. I found the book full of typo and spelling mistake. Sometimes I doubt the correctness of the answer. The practice questions are stragiht forward wherars the questions in the exam are much more complicated. It test your background knowledge but not good enough for the examination.
5,THE Zappa Bible,If you like Zappa you have to get this book. What a better way to learn about Zappa than in his own words. THE MOTHER OF ALL ZAPPA BOOKS.
5,A review of the REAL FRANK ZAPPA BOOK: Repeated stories.,"This book is FUNNY, INTERESTING, AND INTELLIGENT. However, the online material on the internet web sites such as interviews, articles written by and about Frank Zappa available at SAINT ALFONZO PANCAKE PAGE, and the WAY COOL ZONE (found by Yahoo search engines) contain MUCH BETTER AND MORE information than this book. The book is NOT necessary for any fan who has read already the INTERNET ONLINE STUFF which is about 500 8.5x11 pages if printed out on paper. In a nutshell, save your money, don't buy this book, but instead read the fantastic and sensational ASCII texts online ... on the Internet. Just use a search engine and you';ll be WAY better off than the book."
5,Awesome clock!,"Great contemporary style, keeps excellent time and goes great with any decor. I'm very satisfied! I love clocks and this one fits right in with the retro crowd as well. It's easy to read in any light."
5,Song Titles Listed Here:,1. You Stole My Heart Away2. You're Lovely to Me3. Our Troubles End Tonight4. Leah5. Lesbia6. Almeria7. The Honeymooners8. Westwards We're Headed9. My Soul is on Fire10. Endless Night
2,This book was not very good at all!,"I found this book and the rest of the series reasonably entertaining when I first read them at eleven years old, but still not as good as Junior Jedi Knights (my favorite books at the time). Now that I have recently read this book and the whole series again, I realize that they are really not very good at all, and I am generally pretty leniant with books of all kinds! This book in particular was one of the worst. The plot is silly and unbelievable, and the characters and writing are plain awfull. Kids twelve and under probably won't notice or care, but older fans will most likely find them boring and stupid. Also these books do not fit into the timeline at all, so it won't make any sense if you try to read them with other stuff."
2,Shallow Look At Dull Words,"First off, the Editorial Review is somewhat misleading, as there are very few idioms (""say it with flowers"" is not one of them) in this book. The book is mainly concerned with words originating from Middle or Old English -- that is, words whose origins are straightforward.I was hoping for a book that would discuss modern words with unclear (like ""hooker"", ""skyscraper"", or ""reefer""), and include idioms common in today's speech. This book seems to limit its entries to words with easy-to-trace origins, and idioms (like ""spick and span"") that don't see much usage in the books I read.There must be a better reference out there."
2,Too many excuses,"Though interesting, this book might well have been titled ""Why I'm Right and Everyone Else is Wrong"". This is an author with a definite purpose, and any enlightenment one gets is secondary to the book's overall tone of self-justification. Though Feigen shows an intense dislike for ex-Met director Thomas Hoving, Hoving's books consistently deliver more solid information and fewer sour grapes and give a more balanced view of the art world."
3,Last ditch effort to move on without Rik Emmett,"The CD is not that bad. It's definitely worth a listen. The production is nice and has more of a commercial heavy metal guitar driven sound. Guitars definitely stand out along with Gil's voice. Meet new guitarist Phil X, who's not as good as Rik Emmett, but does a decent job filling in, with a sort of Zakk Wylde playing style and crunchy tone. The downside of this disc is the lack of real energy between the band members. Gil's drumming went from a busy John Bonham style of the old days, to a typical basic four four count drum playing. Unfortunately no little keyboard interludes by bassist Mike Levine either. The disc feels like they are trying their best to move on in a different direction without Rik. Overall a decent effort with the best song being "" Child of the City""."
4,Left me very uneasy.,"This book is written as though the main character, Gabriel Anderson, had wrote out his experience and I (as the reader) am reading his words. It all takes place in Rome, Georgia. Gave does not work, has a wonderful girlfriend, and no major problems. When his headaches and nose bleeds begin he ignores them and ends up in the hospital.A male figure in the shadows talks inside Gabe's head and Gabe can see evil, dead beings. No one else can see them though. People around him are dying horribly and many believe Gabe is the killer! Is he?Here is a book that will make you wonder and leave you feeling very uneasy! ****"
1,The Overcoat,"I purchased this item thinking it was the English translation, probably because the title was in English and I could find no indication that it was the original Russian text. I would suggest making it very clear which language the book is written in. I ended up giving it away to one of my colleagues, who is a Russian teacher, to give to a student someday."
4,good reference book,this book of maps would probably be awelcome addition for an experiencedastronomer.....not for a beginningfan of astronomy. Nightwatch wouldbe my recommendation to the later.
4,A Great General Reference With Good Sky Maps,"If you were to buy just one book, this one would be a good choice. It has both seasonal sky charts and detailed sky maps down to magnatude 6.5 for both southern and northern hemispheres. It also contains a good moon map. There are also general explanations for seasonal phenomenon, double stars, galaxy types, etc. etc."
4,Love Harry Potter,"I love the Harry Potter Kids DVD, but it wasn't long enough. After all these years, you'd think there'd be more info about the actors."
2,Disappointed,The brass plate was damaged and the sample Log Book was not included. Unfortunately I didn't have ample time to exchange it before Christmas
4,Nice product,I bought this for my husband who loves to keep up to date on logs and records. The cover is very nice although the metal plate kept falling out. The logbook on the inside has a place for all of the entires necessary to keep up on boat maintenance. I would purchase this item again.
2,Disppointed...........,"I felt furious after scanning this book, especially with the Sample test on the CD! It is not even close to the real exam and full of errors. It is totally a waste of money, and waste of time as well. I am very dispointed with this book because I thought It should be close to the test format after the test has been out there so long. But it doesn't seem to me that the author has ever taken the test by himself! Save your money for a Christmas gift or some thing! There aren't good books out in the market."
3,"Recipes are yummo, but not for my kids","I can't believe this is supposed to be a book dedicated to kid food!? It's dedicated to all those picky eaters out there.... hmmm. This book contains mostly recipes that will not fly on my 3-1/2 year old's plate, and the rest are repeated recipes from her other books. I'm glad I just took this out from the library. I think these recipes would work well with 8 year olds on up, but that's just my opinion. As always, check your library first before wasting your money."
4,Paste makes waste,"I read this when I was 12. I liked it. I think they should have been honest about what happened, rather than trying to cover it up. That would have saved them from a lot of grief.(I wouldn't advertise to the world that I didn't ""get it"" if I were 35.)"
3,"Read the book, too.","I tend to dislike reviews that suggest a potential viewer ""read the book instead."" But as enjoyable as this movie is, the book by James Salter on which it is based is better. Salter was an F-86 pilot who downed at least one MiG in Korea.The book avoids the romantic subplot that seems to irritate several other reviewers, and concentrates on the character and psychology of Saville. That said, ""The Hunters"" as a film is a great look at a little-known chapter in military history - the first jet war."
2,romance spoils a war movie,"I was expecting to see some real combat footage, because a reviewer refered to MIG's.There are no MIG's , they are American F84-F,s.A formula movie except for the romance ,which detracts from the war story.The flying scenes are very good.I wanted to see the F-86 and I did."
4,Sure that prog is 'allowed' to be this fun?,"Emerson Lake and Palmer are just a bunch of self-assured snobs from the Uni who think they know more than the average person. And from listening to 'Hoedown', I'd agree with them. Some sought of classical/country boogie that moves so much it makes you sweat! Who'd have thought such a combination was possible? And who else would put a serious prog number, such as 'Endless Enigma' on the same album as a novelty C&W; number (Sheriff?)Scared to release a 5 star album, Emerson, Lake AND Palmer wisely put a couple of duds at the end of the album. And Greg Lake's standing as 'sexiest man in progressive rock' was not threatened either.Prog and fun? Not sure if the ABWH(&S;) boys have considered the possibility. (Well B did, but that's another matter!) Rating ****"
5,Just the Right Balance,"A well-balanced mix of songs and sounds makes this album one of their most approachable. As is often the case with progressive rockers, the soloing at times gets a bit too demonstrative (as on the title cut) and ELP's lyrics have always lacked something that Jethro Tull and Yes seem to pull off, but precise songs like the cult favorite ""From the Beginning"" and superb ensemble pieces like ""Rodeo"" make this CD a great buy. A good introductory CD for the uninitiated."
2,"Doesn't go into much depth, gets confusing. FIND OTHER BOOK","At first glance this book looks like it is going to be really helpful, but on buying and reading it, I was severely dissapointed. The book does not go into any real depth on subjects - it tells you what your computer should do, but not how to fix a problem when one occurs. It is only really helpful as long as things go exactly as planned. And sometimes the text is just plain confusing. The primary reason I didn't give this book 0 stars is that it does explain how to use most of the software included with it, while many other books just assume you know already."
2,Not as useful as I had hoped,"Yes, it comes with three distributions of Linux: SlackWare, RedHat, and Caldera Lite. I started with the RedHat edition and gave up after three attmpts. It simply would not install on my system. The SlackWare version went on very smoothly.However, once getting it installed, the book does not help very much when configuring XFree86. It scares the user instead of assisting the user with multiple typical examples. Similarly on configuring PPP and using auto-dialing. It covers a few files and points the reader to How-To files on the Internet.This book is not for intemediate Windows users trying to figure out Linux. It lacks a cohesive roadmap, a description of sequence and processes for configuring systems to accomplish real world tasks. It's a little like reading a dictionary when you were looking for a ""how to"" manual.Overall, this appears to be a rehash of material available on the Internet with the author providing one sample thread through the process."
1,DON'T,"DON't do it, this book is so confusing, it has a lot of information, but the probelm is that you undersatdn nothing for me it! some of the authors of the book know nothing about teaching Linux, they might be good on linux, but, ha, this jum around from one point to another, man, I had to call one of my friends to help me installing the program, Please, Please, don't wast your money, buy something else. I liked the Que books, but after this one, I will never buy any of their books even if it was for free, no I change my mind, even if they pay me money to read it, I would not :"
2,Don't buy Caldera.,"I bought this and ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Linux"" to try and get Linux up and running, but after 3 months, I still haven't been able to get online, my sound doesn't work, and my CD & floppy drives won't mount. Avoid this book. You're better off getting Red Hat Unleashed, since there's a wider support base for all the Red Hat users out there."
1,Waste of money,"What a waste of money. It had less installation help than the manual that came with the Caldera 2.2 full package. The CD doesn't work, all it does is lock up my system.Should of taken the advice of others and went with Red Hat!!"
3,For real beginners,"This was certainly designed for the beginner, it gives you great information. In explicit detail. It even has a few good recipe's."
4,MotherD,This was a Good book for a beginner like me. It is very hard to find books like this in the bookstores. I like it. I don't like pressure cookers like I thought I would. You live and you learn.
4,Pressure Cookers for Dummies,"The value of the book is well worth the price. It was delivered in a timely manner and is more or less what I expected. The book would be better if it had a broader line of recipes. Also, it would be helpful it the recipes were a little more detailed."
3,Cooking under pressure,Easy to follow for a novice with a pressure cooker (first one I've owned). Have tried a few of the recipes so far and will continue to use this book. Some of the instructions for prep are pretty basic if you have some cooking experience. Feeling pretty confident to try to convert some of my favorite recipes to the pressure cooker. Significantly speeds cooking time.
2,Good for insomnia,"Though some of the material is useful, I found these tapes to be long and boring. The authors read the text like a funeral procession. I would much rather recommend any of Anthony Robbins work - which always has some NLP, presented in a passionate, immediately useful way."
2,Didn't strike her fancy,"My 1 year old received this train as a first b-day gift. It wasn't nearly as exciting as the Sesame Street ""Teach and Go"" train we inherited from my brother's kids. It doesn't move unless you push it yourself, unlike the Teach and Go train that goes on its own. It mainly sings songs and you can stack it, but the parts of the attachable cars don't have any interactive parts. Boring!"
4,Fantastic Buy,Excellent resource material if you're looking to enhance your Customer Service skills. A must read for anyone in this field
5,A Wonderful Book,"This book was wonderful. It explained everything that you needed and didn't go into to much detail on on specific detail. I now use this book as a reference. It has Appendix A-E and each appendix talks about something different, like he tells you where you where you can buy the things you want and who manufatures them. I love the glossery, whenever I was reading and I didn't know what it was it was sure to be in the glossary and in perfect detail! I recommend this book to whoever wants to learn about computers and how to solve simple problems that would cost you $$$ to go to a place and have them fix it."
1,poor animation (drawn in crayon?); almost none of the lines,"Can't even recommend this one for kids. It's done in the cheapo still-frame ""squiggle"" animation style, fading from one still to the next. They tried to make it a fairy tale. A narrator in voice-over tells most of the story; there is almost nothing remaining of Shakespeare's script. It runs about a half-hour, and the effort to abridge and tidy it up for the eyes of children resulted in the nunnery scene (for example) vanishing as mysteriously as does Ophelia. The lines it includes are mangled beyond recognition.While Hamlet isn't a story for children (so why make the adaptation?), this is just insulting. If you find anything worthwhile in Shakespeare's story, don't inflict this on your kids: they'll get scared when you start shouting at the screen."
3,Quality Cover But Color Fades,Nice well made cover. Material seems very durable. The only negative is that the color has faded slightly in less than 1 month of direct sunlight.
5,Very Fun,"Great grill cover - it was even better than I thought it would be...roomy, bright, sturdy, fun!"
1,Doesn't Hold Up!,"I do NOT recommend this grill cover. I purchased this exact item in March 2009. In just a few weeks, the deep color started to fade on top. As of July 1, it looks completely faded,the peppers are almost gone, and is looking really ugly. The Seems are now splitting. I cannot imagine how it will look one year from now. Unless you plan to use this cover indoors, I would not recommend buying it."
5,A guide to understanding,It's an excellent guide to work with young people in their way to a better understanding the other.
3,Bent Corner,The book is actually in good shape and arrived in a timely manner. My only issue is that one corner of the front cover and several pages are creased or bent. I am not sure if this happened in shipping or storage.An excellent book on tides though.
1,Save your money to buy better components,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I have to agree with other unflatering reviews. This book does not provide any of the detailed information required to build a PC. The four example systems built are redundant for the most part. There's virtually no troubleshooting information and no discussion of tradeoffs between the competing systems (price, performance, relaibility, etc.). The information that is provided is sometimes better explained in the associated product information.Again, I guess I was expecting more detail from this book, but I still don't think it's even appropriate for the beginner.Bottom line ... save your money and buy some some better parts for your PC system."
4,Credit Where due,"David W. Clark was Chairman of the convention, not author of this book. It is a Worldcon Souvenir Book, and it was edited by Jeff Canfield."
5,Great first watch,"Great first watch if your kid likes pink and hearts. Easy to read, accurate, they'll love the pink backlight. Being waterproof is helpful as kids easily forget to not splash around when washing their hands. Price is good, too, as you won't be too upset if/when they lose it. Of course, the kids probably will, if they notice. Timex even provides a discount replacement because they know the probability of loss is high."
1,A cushion without cushion,"I don't normally write bad reviews but this cushion is really bad... in fact I wouldn't call it a cushion at all. The so called ""liquicells"" are non-existent. When you sit on it, what liquid there is moves to the sides, providing no padding or support at all. As a previous reviewer mentioned, you could definitely get better cushioning from a towel (and it would be a lot cheaper). No doubt that this is getting returned!"
5,Useful,The charger is pretty cool and is very useful because no one wants cords running all over their feet while they are trying to drive.
4,What a 'poison'!,"Wow! It's awesome! The lyrics are good, but I didn't really like the voice ""Aaaaah...aaaah...."" (It's like the India music). Actually, I'd rather choose Me Against The Music instead of this... But, Overall, the music is good (I'd give score 8 from 10). About the Video, wooow... I'ts good. I like the part when her hair colored to red (maybe it's a wig). She's doing very good in this video. :)"
5,A Man Named Pearl DVD,"Who could not love this documentary film by Scott Galloway of a gardener in South Carolina? This film depicts the story of Pearl Fryars who has sculpted a most amazing topiary garden in his yard in Bishopville, South Carolina. The film is a must for anyone who truly loves gardening or for anyone who enjoys the true story of an individual who has a passion and lives it. Pearl Fryar's gardens in Bishopville have become legendary during his lifetime. This is just a wonderful documentary of his passion which is gardening. Top rate."
5,"""A Man Named Pearl""",One of the most wonderful and inspiring films I have ever seen. I had my children watch the flim to see the beauty Mr. Pearl Fryar has created and hear his wisdom and purpose. We loved this film! A must see! Thank you Mr. Pearl!
2,The Platinum rRainbow,This book was helpful with facts that were completely unknown to the reader....HOWEVER....It was written decades ago and the onset of the computer and internet seriously outdates the book.
1,Talking Back To Poems,"Mr. Alderson should get his facts straight. In chapter five (""Meaning"") he erroneously refers to Carlos Drummond de Andrade as a woman; he proceeds to analyze Elizabeth Bishop's translation of a Drummond de Andrade poem based on this false assumption. A few paragraphs later he refers to the poem as Bishop's own. I have zero confidence in a book that makes such colossal mistakes."
4,"great banana holder, good headphone holder","I'm sure it does wonders holding bananas, but I haven't tried it.Using it for my razer carcharias headset, works great but reason for 4 stars is that the metal hook digs in a little bit to the padding of the headset if i'm not careful"
3,Sent me the wrong bannana holder...,"Well, for my first gripe they sent me the wrong bannana holder. My second gripe is that I was buying this as a headphone stand and the hook was pointed at a higher angle then the one displayed in the picture which caused an issue when hanging the headphones from the hook. Fortunately I was able to bend the hook down which gave it a better seating and resolved the problem, but would have been nice if they had just sent me the correct version to begin with."
1,Broken as soon as I put the bananas,"I read the reviews before buying it and thought that it could be a good product with great price and quality, but I was wrong.It broken as soon as I put the bananas. I'm really disappointed with it."
2,Nice finish - poor craftsmanship,"This had the brushed metal/stainless steel look that I was after, but the thing was very wobbly."
2,"Great singer, boring album!","Let's not deny it, Paul Rodgers is one of the greatest singers of all time; right up there with Percy Plant, Steve Marriott and David Coverdale. And yes, I'm a fan. Anything by Free and the first three Bad Company albums are pretty much essential listening. But if you're expecting something of that calibre don't bother with this. It's boring, boring, boring! Stellar cast of guitarists notwithstanding, Mr Rodgers is capable of so much more. Even The Firm and The Law were better than this. And don't even mention the travesty that was Queen + Paul Rodgers: laugh - I gave the DVD away after one watch! Thankfully, Paul has come to terms with his past and is now back to his best. The recent Live In Glasgow is great. I suggest you give this one a miss and buy that CD/DVD instead."
2,Annoying And Dissapointing...,"I love vampire movies and this was one of the oddest, didn't make much sense, vampire movies ever. Why Stefan, John Karlen of Dark Shadows fame, beat his bride on their honeymoon, except that he appeared to be a real SOB generally made zero sense. And why was Stefan's mother a man? The movie wasn't even scary! A clunker and boring!"
4,great style-A true classic.,"This is just a great euro cult classic with beautiful style and a different Vampire movie from the normal. Very Gothic & full of color. A must for serious collectors of this genre',"
4,This book is Still useful with Windows XP,"I bought this book some time ago and I still find it useful for my daily use with Windows XP. Specially the chapters on VBScript and HTML and the information on Networking still are very updated. If you still have Windows 98 because your hardware is not supported under Windows XP, (Some Video Accelerator cards) or you are interested in buying a cheap and still useful book for your Windows XP system, so don't look for more....."
4,A Classic Must Have!,"I know this was written in the 1970s, but the application of this book is still current with today's photography industry. Most pros have this book in their library, including me. The Joy of Photography is a remarkable book with great information to use and practice. I recommend this to anyone interested in photography at any level with any type of photography equipment."
2,Great title for a mediocre book,"This book was written at the second half of the 80's when autofocus was pretty new in the market, but it contains some useful advices, mainly if you are a very beginner.Unfortunately I had discovered all books from Kodak have almost exactly the same contents - just some changes in the text, some different pictures, and, oh yes - a different title!If you read any book from Kodak, or have some experience in Photography, forget this book."
2,I'm disappointed,"I am still learning the duties of system adminstration for my Linux box and I have had a need for secure shell for some time. Despite a concern that arose from earlier reviews, I did purchase the book, ""Unix Secure Shell"".While on one hand the book is not nearly as bad as described in an earlier review, I must agree that it is a poor example of technical writing. I found the book confusing and irritating. The author has a tendency to make awkward statements that leave me guessing. Topics and figures are presented out of context.I am hoping to use secure shell to help backup my system. Unfortunately the book covers this topic in only about two pages. While somewhat informative, do not rely on this book as a primary reference."
2,Bad but useful,"It's true, there are a lot of technical errors in this book. The writing style is overly simplified and repetitive. The paper is cheap. The figures are often imprecise. There is no advanced information. It is in no way an impressive tech book.However, for all that, it is a coherent book on the capabilities and function of the ssh utilities. For me, that gives it some value. I like to read books and ssh is big enough to need one, although it could be a bit shorter than this book."
1,Suckiest book ever !,i had this for 2 years. it is so hard to read this stupid thing. This wouldn't help me to actually implement ssh on my pc.
4,Fries,It is as expected. It is portable and very useful. It is much better than the 1000 watt gas generator I initially wanted to purchase.
2,an unedited disappointment,"This book is not without its strengths. The selections from the author's father's journal are interesting. And I do not discount the personal experiences described, either the father's death, or the author's fertility treatments. The problem is that, as written, there is only enough real material for a long magazine article. The rest consists largely of references to what the author is eating, wearing, or listening to on the radio. It is difficult to imagine what, if anything, has been excised. In one excruciatingly cloying passage, the author repeatedly refers to herself in the third person as 'the possibly pregnant person.' I am an enthusiastic reader of McSweeney's, and wanted to like this, but could not. That said, Ms. Fusselman has a good grasp of language, and may have a better book ahead of her."
3,Reasonable reading,"These guys cover the subject reasonably well, although a lot of it is rehashing the OMG document. I enjoyed the vitriolic digs at COM, the authors' views match my own on the superiority of CORBA. In fact, a good summary of the book is ""the OMG standard minus the even-handed neutrality""!"
1,extremely disappointed,"The first two skits were quite funny, but after that I can't even say it went downhill. It was a sheer drop off a high cliff. The remaining skits ranged from not funny to crude with offensive language. The best that my 17 1/2 year old son had to say about it was that it wasn't funny. I filed this DVD where it belonged: in the garbage. I'm glad I bought this used and didn't pay full price, so at least I wasted less money."
2,Rowan Atkinson Live!,"I gave this as a gift for my wife, but she was not pleased with it. It was not very funny and she's a fan of Rowan Atkinson."
3,Very funny but a little distasteful,"I bought this as a gift for my husband who loves Mr. Bean, but I didn't know anything about its content. We were more than pleased to find a few very funny skits but very disappointed to find that some of the skits were beyond crude. They were down right distasteful and not worth watching at all. However, as this is a DVD, you can easily skip over those skits and enjoy the hilarious clean ones. That's why I still give it 3 stars."
1,Poor Quality-Look So disappointed!,Do not order this product!!!!! It took almost a MONTH to receive these candles which were shipped from China. When I did finally get them they were damaged and one was broken. As a bride buying reception decorations I am beyond annoyed!
3,"Color of ""flame"" is yellow green","These are the typical green yellow colored fake candle flame color, rather than amber as shown and described. Otherwise these are as described."
1,This Book is not worth buying,"As a student of Church History and Denominations, and as an author and teacher on the same subject, I honestly have to say the ""Complete Guide to Christian Denominatins..."" is NOT anywhere near being a complete ""guide"". In review of this book, and three others on the same topic (which includes my own yet to be published book) - Rhodes book has the least amount of information (only 105 denominations, compared to 179 in the National Council of Churches book, 193 in The Handbook of Denominations (Frank Mead/Samuel Hill) and 227 on my book (Guide to Denominations - Robert Stearns).Further - many of the denominations are mis-identified as to the family they belong to, and the Churches of God (Reformation Theology group of churches) totally omitted. Very limited in statistics. The interesting feature, however, was the lay out and the quick reference ""bullets"".Robert H Stearns, Reviewer"
3,Perspective,This book gives you perspective and history of each denomination. I find it useful in learning of other Christian theologies. I really wish it would have covered all of the world's major religions.
4,Learn the history of air-combat,"J.E.Johnson provide us the complete circle of air combat. Begins in the early romantic days of the biplane fighters and observers to the days of jet fighters passing through the terrible battles of second world war-in special the Battle of England, which the author participated- with the Spitfires and Messerchimdts. A kind of pearl in war history."
4,THE MAGICAL MAX LINDER,"I confess that I was not too familiar with Max Linder until I saw this film about his life and career in silent films. I can easily see why Chaplin liked him so much. The film clips of Linder's work are most impressive and it is evident that many of his comic actions have been copied by others in later years, especially the sequence with Linder and his reflection in the mirror (which is actually someone else on the other side of the mirror frame.) I remember the hilarious ""I Love Lucy"" episode with Lucy on one side of the mirror and Harpo Marx (pretending to be Lucy) on the other side. Obviously Linder did the mirror routine first many, many years before in silent films. I would like to know more about his tragic death ... he and his wife committed suicide. The movie is a real gem."
3,Spinning Wheels!,"This album offers a mixed bag of material. To say that it's a horrible album would be too extreme. But the songwriting is uneven and placid. The good songs are Hand of Truth, Daddy, One by One, Dylan's Man in the Long Black Coat, and the refurbished Pictures at an Exhibition. By and large it's a safe album nothing lost and nothing gained. Emerson's keyboard intro's on Hand of Truth and One by One are infectious and after a week of listening to this album I found it hard to stop hearing them. This album does grow on you in that sense. Greg Lake's voice is darker than in the past but it's in fine form and suits the music. Carl isn't as flamboyant as he was in the past the the music doesn't call for it. I have no regrets for buying it.It's in the same vein of ""We Can't Dance"" by Genesis, ""Sur la Mur"" by the Moody Blues, ""Talk"" by Yes, or an Asia album."
3,Wonderful Starting Point for ASP beginners,"You will find this book very helpful if you are new to Active Server Pages. The book describes very clearly what ASP is, how it works, what it does, etc. This book will also make the beginner comfortable with how to write basic VBscript or similar in order to code their Active Server Pages. Wonderful coverage is given to all the basic ASP objects, their properties, and methods and how to invoke the power of each. This book has some funny prose to it and is not overly in-depth, but it will make a newcomer comfortable with integrating their current html skills, client-side scripting skills, and ASP into useful applications."
4,Excellent book for both advanced and beginners,"Excellent guide for developping dynamic, Interactive Web Site. This book goes into relevent details and guides you through the process of development without assuming that you have 20 years of development experience behind you.I would recommend it for junior developpers"
3,I want to like it,"I want to eat healthy and I want to like this cookbook, but I cannot eat seafood. Even reading about seafood or looking at pictures of it makes my stomache upset and I feel like vomiting. It would be nice to find a healthy cookbook that is not loaded with seafood."
4,Excellent for new cooks,I purchased this for my daughter's birthday. She is trying to eat better while buying local items and still making things she and her SO will enjoy at the end of a hectic workday.She says this is great. She likes the pictures and suggestions with the recipes.
4,Great recipes that even your kids will like,"I do not consider myself a good cook and pretty much need a recipe to put a meal together. This cookbook has simple, easy to follow recipes. The recipes use everyday items and there is no need to go to a specialty store for ingredients which is nice since I am usually toting 3 kids with me.The meals I have made have been very flavorful. Each recipe has a breakdown of calories, fat, carbs, protein, etc. which is nice for someone tracking their intake."
2,It could have been so much better :(,"The author spends the entire first half of the book on the battle over Coruscant and the rescue of Palpatine. This leaves little room for Anakin's fall to the dark side or other important elements such as the Battle of Kashyyk, the death of the Jedi or even the construction of Darth Vader's life support suite which he spent an entire 2 paragraphs on! The second half of the book seemed rushed and I was largely dissapointed.You can also clearly ascertain that Mr. Stover is a martial artist by his unending need to describe, in detail, the fighting styles of each of the jedi.It could have been so much better!"
5,Explains the movie better. More in-deph look at the characters.,"This book explains the characters and lets the reader know what they are thinking and feeling. You get a better idea of why things in the movie happened the way they did. For example: Why Anakin seems jealous over Obi-Wan speding time with padme; Why Obi-Wan leaves Anakin in the lava pit; Why Anakin turns to the darkside. There were also parts in the book that should have been in the movie like the creation of the Rebel Alliance.In my opinion the best part of the book is right after Anakin is put in the Darth Vader armor. The book discusses the pain he feels as he breathes and the loss he feels. He has a feeling of regret almost.By the time I got to the end I didn't want it to be over. That's how much I connected with the characters. I can't wait for the sequel book to this.I recommend seeing the movie first, then read the book."
1,LEFT OUT TOO MUCH.NO WOOKIE BATTLE EITHER,Books are supposed to have more than the movie.well thats not the case here.The writer never mentions chewbacca or anything about the wookie battle on their homeworld.Anyone who has seen the movie has seen this in the movie.If the book is supposed to be about the movie don't leave parts out from the movie.he also writes to much about the space battle at the start of the movie and doesnt go into enough detail on other things.They couldn't hire a better writer than this guy?Is it that hard to write about everything in the movie?Most movie books write about everything in the movie and then some.LUCAS SHOULD HAVE HIRED ALAN DEAN FOSTER THE ORIGINAL WRITER OF STAR WARS EPISODE IV.ALAN WROTE about the whole movie and a lot more not included in the movie.Thats why people liked brian daley or alan dean foster star wars books.they included more than the movie.but this writer falls way short.
2,Way too long and not enough new material,"I really enjoyed the movie. The book leaves something to be desired. Stover adds dialogue were it really isn't needed. He overindulges in drawn out conversations and innuendo and tries to explain why every little comment made by Anakin is the most important occurrence in the history of the galaxy. In many instances, especially with Obi-Wan Kenobi, he really takes away from the characters by adding to the dialogue and overdrawing on their feelings. It almost works with Anakins fall to the dark side but was really inappropriate in most of the book. There are also many unexplained references to other books (especially ""Shatterpoint"") that don't add to the story at all. Still, if you're looking for a vacation book and can stomach the additions, it's an ok read."
3,Not worth upgrading!,"Just got my hand on GWTW BD single disc edition, and I'm glad I didn't buy the ultimate edition (Otherwise I will be even more disappointed!). Image is only marginally sharper (very marginally!) then DVD, and dimmer (and I though HD suppose to make film look brighter!)! My GWTW 4 disc DVD Collection Edition actually appeared brighter! Grain is also more obvious due to HD.I should have expected this, as there is only so much WB could do to the 70 years old source material. No matter 4K or 8K remastered, the image is always going to be soft and grain is going to be obvious.Stick to your DVD unless you haven't get it yet (Most already have 4 or 5 versions!)! Otherwise don't waste your money, or better still, get the DVD! Definitely much cheaper!And can forget about the Collector's Edition Box Set, which is WAY OVER PRICE!"
5,classic film,When I found out that an opportunity to buy this movie in Blu-Ray was available I just had to get it. I saw it many years ago in a theater & wanted to see it again. This is a great deal. The price was right & being able to buy it in Blu-Ray was even better. This will be a collector's item for years & a welcome addition to my film library. Thanks to Amazon for another great deal.
2,"Sorry, South","This movie was as painful as reading ""The Jungle."" One disappointment after another made me absolutely sick of Scarlett halfway through the movie, and her behavior just got worse. There's no doubt that this movie is an epic and was well made, but I found myself willing myself to finish the movie because of the dreadful conduct of its protagonist. I know many others will disagree with me, and I would allow that this movie should be considered a classic (pretty hard to argue with its box office success). Personally, though, I barely survived my viewing."
5,This is the greatest movie ever made.,"This movie has earned the title of best ever made in my book. Everything about it is perfect. The people who gave it the bad reviews just do not understand. This is not meant to be a movie promoting racism. It is simply depicting life during the Civil War Era. Saying that the characters were portrayed too racist in this film is like saying the Germans were too mean in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I'm sorry if you do not like historical accuracy but i think it makes the movie all the better. The social flaws in the characters make them intriging to watch. The message in this movie is a great one in my opinion. It shows that if you mistreat people it will come back around to you, even if you become a thoughtful person. That is the ultimate lesson Scarlett learns and what I think anyone watching it will learn too. Go buy this movie. It needs to be in your video collection"
5,Gone With the Wind,"Looking at the costumes, buildings and backrounds in Blu-ray is amazing and great fun. The photo journal included with the Blu-ray disks was well done and very interesting."
1,Not Wide-Screen Version,"Re: ""Gone With the Wind"" (The Scarlett Edition): Beware. Even though this 3-disc set is Blu-Ray, the movie itself is not widescreen format. I certainly have no desire to pay almost $30.00 to watch an epic film like ""Gone With The Wind"" as an old square picture (with black on either side of the square imate) on my HD tv. How disappointing. If you want the widescreen version, don't purchase this particular item."
1,Gone with the wind,"Amazon should not purchase dvds from this vendor. This is the second dvd of Gone with the wind i am returning for not playing on my desktop, laptop computers and blue ray dvd or any dvd player. As for the film,Gone with the wind is one of the top 10 movies ever made."
1,Historically inaccurate and racist,"The portrayal of African Americans in this movie is a disgrace. The movie is glorifying the old south and thus glorifying slavery. When I watched this racist flick--I rooted for General Sherman! Slavery was wrong--the south was wrong--the right side won--get over it! This is like a sugar coated ""Birth of a Nation"". (and the story is boring as well)"
4,package was broken,"when the discs arrived, the plastic package was broken. The discs were ok. I love Gone with the wind!"
5,Gone with the Wind,I love it. Have watched it repeatedly since receiving it. It is my all time favorite movie. It is great value for the moneyl
3,Love the movie but Blu ray not so much.,"Possibly it is my copy. Possibly it is my blu ray player. In my opinion, stay away from blu rays made in Mexico. Quality is poor"
1,Viewing stinks,"I am completely disappointed that this is a standard format DVD. Gone With The Wind should never be anything but letterbox. It is heinous to chop off part of the screen. People. Standard format cuts off 1/4 of the original movies. They list no info for this movie on the site, but a picture of the back cover. 2 disks are not warranted either. Can I return it after opening??? I refuse to watch it this way."
2,A Disappointment,"We are studying the Civil War in my sophomore American History class, and everybody must read a book about the Civil War, so i took on the challenge of reading GWTW. Wow. What an amazing book. No other book can make you love and hate a character at the exact same time. It will be hard to enjoy other books when you compare them to GWTW. So, after reading it i just HAD to watch the movie. I couldn't even finish it. It left out a lot from the book, and you didn't get to know the characters as well. I do realize that it was made in the late thirties, and that it would take hours and a narrator to include everything in the book, but it was still a disappointment. But if you liked the movie, you MUST read the book. Don't be scared by the size! And the first four hundred pages worth of actionless descriptions are necessary in order to lay a good foundation for the greatest story ever told. <- and that is an understatement!!! Please read this book! You will never be the same!"
5,Seen more than 10 times!,"This was a gift,however, I have seen more than ten times. I first saw this film when as a second grader my mother dropped me off at the theater alone and I saw my first history moment.I never recovered from this. Each time it is on TV I watch. Never bores me. I have a Clark Gable doll and we owned a Victorian home with a giant fireplace mantel from a CG movie. Addicted, yes..."
3,It was Okay!,This is one of my mom's favorite movies and she could watch this one again but though I thought it was good once was enough for me and there are a lot of old classic movies that just appeal to me a lot more!
5,What can you say?,"Rhett Butler; Clark Gable, Scarlett O'hara; Vivien Leigh, two legendary characters performed to perfection by two great actors.Beautiful, confused and volumptous Scarlett is desperate to find love. If not with her first love, the second to come along, Rhett. She and he confront the American Civil War head on and comes out with a couples scrapes and bruises. A few dead friends. But both are stronger and wiser.Great great great! Anymore can be said??"
5,A love of the land and the south,"A chance to feel the love of the land that has been lost to most of us due to urban moving trends. Also an insight into the feelings of those of us for the south. We are not all racist rednecks,lacking in schooling."
5,It's a classic,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
5,Gone with the wind,My all time favorite movie. I had it in a VCR version so the DVD is much better.I would recommend it to anyone who loves the movie.
3,Could have been better,"Overall I was satisfied with this product, but was quite dissapointed in the sound quality. The picture quality and color are reproduced very well, but in a movie (especially a dvd) sound is very important, and this one was laking."
2,Not a good movie for me,"Everybody thinks that this is their favorite movie. But not for me. Scarlett is a little rascal and Rhett also. They are both alcoholic. Why need to waste 4 hours watching this trash film. What's more this movie is easy to get used to it like about 5 times you watched it. This movie maybe for you, but not for me."
2,Clark Gable is too mousey,"The movie is too long, is overkill Lesile Howard is too ugly to be Ashley Wilkes. Vivien Leigh is too British to be Scarlett O'Hara Clark Gable is too mousey and short to be Rhett Butler The whole movie about this bitchy woman whining. I give it a 2 out of 5 stars."
1,GONE WITH THE WIND,"I recently purchased Gone with the Wind in the 70th Anniversary Edition.It came as two disks in a standard plastic folding container. One disk was the movie itself, the other was the making of the movie and other special features.Unfortunately, while the second disk was fine, the fist and most important one had no sound. The video worked but nothing could be heard, so rather than watch a silent movie I returned it for credit.I will say that credit was issued immediately and with no questions asked.I will try again to buy it, perhaps this time I will get a good copy."
4,Gone with the Wind,Good movie. A Classic that should live forever in the minds of those who viewed it.
4,Gone With the Wind,"This movie is a wonderful adaption of the book. The actors and actresses showed great talent and energy. The sets were very realistic, as were the costumes. However, as elaborate and colorful as it was, no adaption of the book can be adequate. Scarlett looked a little too old for the age she was supposed to be; Ashley Wilkes was not the handsome lad he was in the book; and Melanie was much too glamorous for her frail character. I would recommend watching to the movie, to compare it with the book, but stick with the original book. No movie can do it justice."
1,Where's the 5-Star Version?,"I've just watched the magnificent DVD restorations of ""Cleopatra,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Ben Hur"" and other Hollywood masterpieces. All of them had extraordinary documentaries, screen tests, extras. But what in the world is holding up the 5-star DVD version that all of us fans of ""Gone With the Wind"" are waiting impatiently for? As 2 other fans have noted, there's nothing extra on the present DVD. A two-minute preview. Wow. Thanks a lot.If studios are able to give spectacular restorations and care to all-time favorites like ""Sound of Music"" and ""Spartacus"", then we demand an even more outstanding DVD treatment of the greatest movie of all time. Say, come to think of it, where's the DVD version of ""Doctor Zhivago""--another much beloved classic? Get with it Ted Turner, who owns GWTW, and all you other people in charge. We want our 5-star edition of GWTW--like yesterday."
4,Also... It's not a widescreen version,"Although I enjoy owning GWTW on DVD, I am disappointed it is not a widescreen version as most DVDs seem to be. I suppose for the price paid ($14 from Amazon) it is a reasonable value, but it WAS a big letdown when I realized I had a pan and scan version. This fact is not apparent from the description of the product."
5,Happy,Excellent quality. It's still as good a movie today as it was 70 year ago when it won numerous Academy Awards. It was a gift for a friend and it made her very happy!
5,What can I say the BEST,"I wish movies were still made this way. So much has been lost with computers. I love special effects that computers can do, but to they don't compare to the real stunts that old movies achieved It just felt more human."
1,Don't order from this seller,I odered this on 1-29-09 and have not received my movie. I sent e-mails to the seller and received no response. Seller had 98% POSITIVE rating when I odered. I'm not a happy camper!!!
1,"As God as my witness, I'll never look at this crappy movie again.","""But it's a classic!"" you may say to me. Well, you know what? It doesn't matter because it still sucks. To tell you the truth, I never even watched it. I had an old VHS tape of it that was recorded off of CBS in 1983 and I just fast-forwarded through the movie to get to the commercials. Even at a high-speed this movie is crap. Frankly, my dear friends, I don't give a damn about anything in this movie."
1,The worest movie of all time Personally it stinks on ice !,"Gone with the wind bla bla ok reveal mean for one thing I hate blood for another thing it has major vilonce this movie should diserve only one award ,The worest movie that ever was made in this whole entire universe Sound of Music is way better bottom line is this movie ain't no ten awards !"
1,Something I bought for Mom,"I have nothing nice to say really. I bought this for my mom who loves it.(God only knows why.) That is how I buy gifts, what the receiver would like, not what I would like. Personally, I think the movie stank.(Made to watch it as a kid.) When I watched it Melanie was a wilting flower, Scarlet was a ho and Rhett should have divorced her and taken the kid and the kid never would have died. Just a bunch of dumb people doing dumb stuff and a lot of whining. Ashley was a whimp and I won't even touch on the whole slavery issue which had the main characters all walking around like confused idiots and also fighting a war over. Stupid! Just don't make slaves of humans in the first place because it's wrong and immoral = no war and problems solved. Hire some people and pay them to work your stupid cotton farms at a decent wage, treat them well, blah blah blah. Just a dumb movie. Some people find this romantic? Yuck!"
4,Romantic Classic,"A must view for all who love romantic movies. Definitely a classic. I think I would ""give a darn"" for this movie!"
5,My favorite movie,Gone with the Wind is my absolute favorite movie! For anyone who hasn't seen it - it's an absolute MUST.
5,A Keepsake,"This is my all-time favorite movie. The movie is shot in 1939's new Technicolor. It has amazing costumes and acurate sets. So many of the lines have become quotes that have entered the pop culture even today. When Scarlett parr with Rhett at Twelve Oaks, I was riveted to the dialogue. Other must-see scenes - the proposal scene, the fade out of Tara with the sunset, and the final ""I don't give a damn"" scene. If you want to study up on popular culture, this is a must-see movie."
5,A Call For Churches Everwhere,"I have experienced diverse worship styles in churches, differing definitions of what that worship means, and confusion as to why worship is essential for the Christan life. In many churches today, there seems to be more of a concern for putting on a show, big productions, etc. than for drawing people into a deeper fellowship with God. For some, worship has become the central theme of their Christian experience, and for others, something that ""those wacky Charismatics"" experience. Tozer, with prophetic insight, reveals the problem with the church today in relation to its worship and this distressing fact: many in this age have never experienced the sweet fellowship with God that can only come through intiamte worship as the creature to the Creator. This book is highly recommended for all sincere Christians who desire to move past the outer courts of ""showy"" worship, and into the holy of holies where true worship can be experienced."
4,very good,"Startin' Up A Posse is one of the all time greatest songs, so make sure you get the version of this CD that contains the song. All the songs are fun to listen to, even though I was never really a fan of Persistance of Time that much. Long live OLD ANTHRAX!"
3,Average at best,"This book gives a fairly thorough treatment of remote-access topics (like T1, ISDN, Frame Relay, etc.) Lots of Q&A at the end of the chapters, lab scenarios, and testing CD are major pluses. But like so many tech books, the writing style is mediocre, and there are lots of errors in the examples."
1,Pictures Too Small,I was disappointed to find that this version was small and hard to see. I thought I was getting the larger sized paperback. I'll be returning this copy due to the fact that the images were so small that I could not see what they were doing in the pictures. Very disappointed. I wonder where I might find the version I was looking for?
2,Leaves something to be desired.,"After I rescued 2 beta fish from very poor conditions, I needed some really good information on their care. I did not find it in this book. It has a couple paragraphs about diseases, absolutely no charts or diagrams for biology or anything, and while the pictures were really beautiful, they had nothing to do with the topic on the same pages. There is a lot about how to have beta fights, and speaks of it in a very condoning tone! This is quite cruel and inhumane. There is I grant you some decent very basic info that you could glean off the internet yourself in an hour or two."
5,Awesome! Excellent! Remarcable! Very Accurate and Informational!,"Excellent and remarcable, based on true facts! Very accurate accurate and informational! Showed both sides of the pioneer and smartest Cocaine Lord of the twentieth century!!"
1,Give me an 8 ball in a fit of the Johnny Walker black,"well the first aspect of this video that I found extremely disappointing, was the fact that it was not mentioned anywhere that the whole thing is in Spanish but I'm sure was covering the same topics that have been covered before about Mr. Pablo anyway if you're looking for solid entertainment I recommend a lot of other documentaries or even blow with Johnny Depp and less your Spanish-speaking you should not watch this video and you probably shouldn't go into the cocaine business either respectfully Johnny Irish"
4,It does the job.,"I am technically oriented and I wasn't very happy when Novell made a bean counter course a prerequisite for their Certified Internet Professional program. To make things worse their are no practice tests for this course. So it was with a certain lack of enthusiasm that I ordered Novell's Certified Internet Business Strategist Study Guide and began preparing for the test.When I read the book, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and I actually learned a lot of interesting things about putting a business on the Internet. I made my own practice test by copying all the questions and answers at the end of the chapters to 3 X 5 index cards. After spending a week plowing through a stack of 200 index cards I passed the test with a score of 750 out of 800.While I wasn't enthusiastic about the material, the book contained everything I needed to pass the test. For that I give it four stars."
4,must have,"one of the lesser known yes albums, but with a defonite place in the progression of yes music. A must have for all yes fans no collection can ever be complete without it."
5,Kosmic!,"Sorry, but this is one of the GREAT Yes albums. I know I know, it's got Trevor Rabin's fingerprints all over it, but it's also got Jon Anderson's fingerprints all over it. Is there really any finer Yes track than ""Endless Dream""? ""Where will you Be?"" could have fitted comfortably on ""Going for the One"".....and there are shatteringly moving tracks: ""The calling"", "" I am Waiting""....and the base metal of ""state of play"" still stimulates the nervous system if played at the right volume. A very very special Yes record, criminally underrated. GET IT !"
5,Absolute gem of an album!,"This album is the most underrated and underpromoted Yes album of all. The songs are excellent. Yes drummer Alan White said it is the best album the band has ever done (he probably meant the Yes-West version of the band). Great album for music fans who are not as familiar with other Yes material, which might be a bit more progressive."
1,Weak Yes.......Period!!!,"This is the third in the line of the Rabin era Yes fueled attempts. The others were 90125, Big Generator, and Talk here.Rabin attempted on this album to mesh more closely with Anderson, and although there are some interesting melodies floating around, there is still the basic whammy bar distorted guitar of Rabin which lacks emotional depth. I've re-listened to it again recently and I can't connect to it as I can other Yes titles."
2,Low Water mark: Yes as Rabin back up band,"Trevor Rabin did a remarkable thing with Yes in 90125. He played an important part in the very fine BIG GENERATOR. But this was a real mistake. Yes was clearly out of gas by this point, and went through the motions behind Rabin's lead. Steve Howe was never positive about Rabin's contributions, and this sealed it as far as Howe was concerned. He is right. Apart from the closing track, it is an OK CD by a hired gun. Production values are fine, but this should have been billed as a Trevor Rabin disc. The franchise value was diluted by this effort. It would signal a tail spin for YES that they would not pull out of until MAGNIFICATION. Not as bad as DRAMA, but certainly not up to par."
5,Can't Get My Nails Done Without It!,"My nail salon normally carries this and without it I have to sit forever under the dryer, but they've been out for quite a while so I took it upon myself to get my own and now it's all good again (well, except for the jealous patrons who wish they had their own). This is the best quick-dry for nails that I've ever used."
4,good enough !!,it dries the nail polish in about 6 min but only the surface. still if u want to purchase it buy the spray. it works a lot faster and a lot less messier
4,Excellent Read,"Excellent marine biology books that are written for the lay reader can be hard to come by. I read this book about 10 years ago and gave it away to a friend. I recently was thinking I would like to RE read it and ordered it from Amazon. It is a wonderful autobiographical account of the author's life as a marine bioligist and his travels and career. Although filled with interesting trivia regarding the British Isles, as well as other islands around the globe, history, personal anecdotes regarding friends and acquaintances, there is still enough marine science, scuba diving adventures, and amazing information about the ocean and it's denizens to keep any one interested. I am glad I ordered it for another read. It was even more enjoyable on the second time around and I recommend this book for anyone with the least bit of interest in the ocean."
4,it seems to work!,"We tried this out on a bottle wine a couple of weeks ago. We finished the bottle a few days later and it seemed to be fine. We are not wine experts, so take my opinion for what it is worth. I do wish that this product came with more detailed instructions. My son (a professional chef who loves and understands wine) showed me how to use this product. Without his direction, I am not sure I would have known what to do."
2,Out of Gas,"I've used gas wine preservers for many years with good results. In my opinion, it's the best way to preserve an opened bottle of wine.Private Reserve is a good product except that the last can I bought had only 22 two second bursts in it. They advertise 120 uses and 600 seperate sprays. I don't know if someone tampered with only this bottle or whether it's the norm but beware that you may run out of the gas sooner than later."
1,"Too bad ""DreamWeaver Bible"" isn't available yet ...","After purchasing this book through Amazon, I THEN read all these poor reviews, and all the favorable refernces to the upcoming ""DreamWeaver Bible."" I have no further thoughts about ""Using DreamWeaver"" than what's already here, so I'll spare the author of any further pain."
5,Excellent battery,"Bought this as a second/spare battery for my work phone which is heavily used, and it helped a lot.Battery arrived brand new and lasted for well over a year."
3,Richard was right!,"Yeah I read Richards review but I just had to find out for myself. It was a pain to put together and I even managed to display it decently, but I have to be very careful around it or it falls of. I say If you have the money get one of the better Suigintous but if you're a broke bastard like me then for the price its about the coolest Suigintou that you will find."
2,Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot,"As a person, and as a great American and patriot, there is no equal to Jimmy Stewart, and he is truly one of my heroes, and by virtue of him leaving Hollywood to fight during WWII embodies him greatly in the history of this nation. Having said that, I found the book on my hero boring, devoid of any substance for his incredible service, and lacking any in-depth research into this extraordinary person. The entire book talks more about other people than it does about Jimmy Stewart. I bought the book thinking I was going to learn more about this man during WWII than about his Hollywood career, but the entire book falls short of any reading pleasure. I was sorely disappointed, and I would encourage no one to buy it. Save your money for Jimmy Stewart's biography. I'm sure it's much more impressive."
4,loved this book,I read this book as a young teen probably over 30 years ago and then re-borrowed it a few times from my friends mom over the years to re-read ( I rarely re-read) she finally lost it. i have never forgotten this book though..it haunted me...so I will probably buy a copy it....can't believe it's still circulating
2,"A bland, overrated love story with historical interest.","This book was recommended to me by a friend, who knows I enjoy historical fiction. Well, yes... I will give the author credit in period research. However, her thesis is based more in mysticism which, regardless of your religious views, does not complement the facts. (I realize astrology has played a very important role historically and this is not my point of contention.) What remains is a love story, in which the underdeveloped characters do not induce much sympathy in the reader. Added to this we have the 'guru' doctor who mends the broken hearts from the previous life, but we are never told how. All in all a tedious read."
2,What a let down,"Having read Katherine, and loved it, I was anxious to begin reading this one, especially after all the good reviews it's gotten. Unlike Katherine, the heroine is not the least likeable. I kept on reading thinking it had to start living up to its hype. It never did. The history was probably the best part of the book but I wasn't looking for a history lesson. Very hard to understand how so many people liked it enough to give it 5 stars."
2,Mis-ordered,"This set may have been just fine for another car, but I mis ordered and needed the four-piece set instead."
3,I saw a camera man in the movie...,"When they are leaving the drainage pipe, the upper left corner is a camera guy with glasses on looking inside the pipe. Haha. This isn't the first time I've caught an error."
4,Wincott makes the flim worthwhile,"Not the most original storyline: a guy heading nowhere with his life. His only assets are his muscles which he uses in ways that don't make for an honest living. His gambling and boozing drives his finacee (Charlene Tilton) to the arms of his adversary, Rico. He cleans up his act, but must fight one last fight. Guess who wins? Wincott and Tilton are too talented for such a lame script, but Jeff Wincott's talents make up for it."
1,Bose Speaker Installation,"In renovating our house we installed 2 pair of the Bose virtually invisble speakers. There were no problems until after the painting, when the speakers went into the walls; apparently, they just hang there, inside the rough-in plate and sheetrock. There is no screw connection to hold them in place, with the result that the grilles of 2 of them are flat against the wall, and the grilles of 2 of them stick out on the top, probably because of insulation between the wall studs (which is standard, at least here in the Northeast). I am going to try to take them back out of the wall and remove some insulation, but it is annoying, to say the least -- neither the rough in plates (which are just flat stamped metal pieces, vastly overpriced) nor the speakers are exactly budget models."
1,bad......,"The only book I ever threw away....this guy is so full of himself...""big great texan""....barf! story was not so bad if you can get beyond the I am a big tuff guy!"
4,I liked it.,"Made for a tough decision between wanting to keep reading or wanting to ride, Hope to meet the author on the rode some day."
1,This is just plain bad,"I just got this gun. It was cool, till it broke. It broke on the third day after Christmas. First, it would not fire, even though the magazine was in it. Then, the safety and trigger spring fell out and now it doesn't even make the noise. I have seen better things come out of my dogs [back]."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"I got this gun, charged the battery for 2 and a half hours fired a coupe rounds, re-loaded the clip and then; even though the clip was in and the battery was charged it did not work. I tried re-charging and dis-charging the battery and re-re loading the clip over and over. Thes is a horrible gun!! Buy a spring gun!"
5,this thing is amazing,this thing is awsome it can shot far fast the only thing bad about this gun is on mine when i first got it it got some bbs jamed in it so i was feeling how much air cam out of this thing its alot and a bb flew out and nailed me in the tip of my finger it left a welt the size of the bb in my finger for a week but during battle this thing is awsome u just run out of bbs fast if u get someone in a good postion u could nail them with every shot every one should have this gun
5,wow...,i got this gun after christmas and i opened up the package and i was like holy cr@p when i saw this beast of an airsoft gun. i shot a soda can i put on a fence post using the scope after loading it with a couple of bbs. if u want a cheap AEG buy this monster!
2,Uninteresting,"In this book a bridge collapses in Peru. Five people lost their lives. This is the story of their lives. Aside from that this book didn't make much sense to me. I found it dull and often uniteresting. The only decent part, was the story of the twins, Manuel and Esteban. I really don't recommend reading this book. However, if you are a Wilder fan or you want to read a classic piece of literature pick up this book."
1,finding god.,"man spends his life trying to prove the existence of god. he does it by exploring the lives of dead people, not my cup of tea."
1,save your money - do not buy this cd !!!!H,"Having owed this on vinyl, I was looking forward to adding this to my collection in digital audio. But what a surprise when I played this cd and it lacked the dynamic range and ambiance of the original - I made the mistake of ordering the first version I found - shame on me, lesson learned - note to self "" do more research and read the reviews and check for alternate releases "" - subsequently, I ordered the Shout Factory label version of this album and what a difference that made - the fullness and grandeur was back. Save your bread and do not buy this trash......"
5,MIND BlOWING!,"Shivers up and down my spine!The hair on the back of neck stands up when I hear BSS in this format.I have heard this in album and cd format over 1,000 times.This DVD format sounds like it was recorded in 2000. Like never before you can hear everything.Every instrument in a way like never before. It has a live sound like your there.I have had the pleasure of seeing ELP live 3 times and it sounds very close to that, but better. I own just a standard DVD player (non DVD ""audio"" player) and the surround sound effect is very,very good.Not overkill,tastefully done.It is very obvious a lot of time and effort was put into this remix.I just cannot believe they could get such a clean sound out of a 27 year old recording. The music?.....Like I said I`ve heard it over 1,000 times with many,many more to go."
2,Misses the mark,"I was so looking forward to hearing this on my new toshiba 4800. What a letdown.Most of the material seemed to be different versions or outtakes of a quad soundtrack they did not release thirty years ago.Maybe DTS would have helped.After tweeking my system the disc improved somewhat,but..still all hype cant turn me on."
2,recall,"We obtain a vinyl disc ELP ""Brain salad surgery"" production Shout! factory records. The disc has on both sides of the broad transverse stripes. As Grading is similar to the Fair. It happened at the factory packaging. Although the seller advertised it as new. I would like to sent me a new drive, without damage, and even without an envelope."
3,"Great music, bad mixing","Loved the choice of music on this CD, but the one complaint I have revolves around the way the CD was 'compiled'. Each cut is at a different volume which just drives me nuts fiddling with the CD-player. It's as if Mr. Palmaccio just took the cuts from various albums & plopped them on this CD without any continuity. In my experience, it seems that the best of 'the best' CD's have been remixed to include consistent volume throughout, so despite the excellent choice in music on this compilation, it only garners 3-stars in my book because of that draw-back."
1,Heart's Haven,The story line had original promise. Then as reading this book I realised that ideas were not finished. Story lines were left unfinished and unresolved. The ending seemed rushed or edited roughly leaving me feeling cheated for having spent the time to read it.
4,"Traditional, beautiful","These were everything I wanted in dishes, cheaper than I could buy them on clearance at the store. Sturdy, mugs feel good in your hand, substantial, a bit heavy (which I hadn't considered) but overall I'm very pleased."
5,For the journeyman in all of us,"This video is not just an informational documentary or a resource for the small part of our population whose lofty goals include one day hiking the AT. It is also a thought-provoking and entertaining film, accessible to all people, regardless of background. TREK has a beating heart, and a true sense of adventure. The people who drive the action are brave and sincere individuals. This film is truly compelling, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested."
5,Millie-Millie,"I really enjoy this album. It's the first album Millie has made that combinds rock, pop,and country all in one package. Although, this album was a push in a different dirrection for her and was I'd say somewhat of a risk, in the end it all paid off. Her voice is still as strong and beautiful as it always was. Whenever I listen to this album, it makes me feel like getting up to sing and dance along. It's not offten that you listen to an album and every time it puts a smile on your face. Great Work, Millie!"
2,Just OK,"If you're a fan of logic problems, this is just OK. I thought the price was very high for the number of puzzles actually included in the book. I went through the entire book in just a couple of hours. Too easy, no grids, and all-in-all, fairly disappointing."
5,Traditional Regency,"From the back cover:Forced marriageLord Adam Calthorpe had been rash to promise to look out for a fellow soldier's sister when he was killed at the battle ofWaterloo. Katharine Payne was a golden-eyed virago who flouted Adam's authority at every turn !Maybe taking her to stay with his mother for the Season would absolve him of his responsibilities - not that such a headstrong chit, however enchanting, would ever find herself a husband. Only when an unscrupulous man started pursuing her did Adam come to realise that fulfilling his promise might involve marrying the girl himself..."
2,Disappointingly light,"I wanted a book that explains how NTP works, so I gambled $4.00 on a used copy of this one.I lost.If you want some lightweight handholding in setting up an NTP configuration, especially on Unix/Linux systems, this book would be OK. It's no substitute for the reference documentation that comes with NTP software, but it does give a reasonable overview--the sort of thing that could be easily conveyed in a ten-page white paper, not a whole book.However, if you want a robust explanation of what NTP does to handle errors, clock drift, and communication problems, this isn't it. There are a few packet dumps, but the explanation doesn't say much about what the packets mean, and doesn't begin to touch on how the protocol actually works.I fund no outright errors in the book, just an extraordinary percentage of fluff. I should have boughtComputer Network Time Synchronization: The Network Time Protocolin the first place."
3,Could have been much better,"This book contained less than 100 pages of useful information. The relevant information was good, but whether it was worth the price is debatable. I bought the book used for half price and still didn't feel I got my moneys worth."
4,From The Inside Flap:,"Of course this book is dated. All classics are. It is nevertheless timeless.The array of recipes in this rare collectiomincludes such mouth-watering treats as ""Rapee Pie"" and ""Pepper Steak Flambee."" ""Coquilles Eskomo"" and ""Oyster Canadian"" set the pace for exotic delicacies, and those who like to live dangerously can try some culinary curiosities: ""Squirrel Pot Pie,"" or ""Pemmican Rub-a-Boo,"" among others. But the recipes are only half the fun. Very much to the point is the fact that they are complemented by a veritable archive of Canadian writings on every aspect of food and drink, gathered from the works of Robertson Davies, Margaret Atwood, Sigurd F. Olson, Stephen Leacock, Sir Sanforn Fleming, and other authors, journalists and dignitaries. As well, there's an intriguing collection of historic engravings, cartoons, advertisements, and menus, plus a wealth of appealing full-colour photographs."
2,"Not too bad, but not too great.","This item is too bad for the cost, but it does not hold up to its ""de-clumping"" promise."
4,Not a pack of three,"This is my second one. I bought one from somewhere else and then lost it. Works great, no clumps or leaks. I only received one shaker."
4,good design; ok performance,"I like the design. I wouldn't trust it to be leak proof sideways in a gymn bag, but is generally well sealed. The biggest downside is the frozen inner core. It definately imparts a funny taste if you use it. Otherwise your drinks will taste fine. The lower portion has plenty enough room to hold a scoop of protein powder or recovery mix. The mixing blades are useful for standard mixes, but not that effective for protein drinks which tend to clump more."
5,Just what I wanted!,"I love this shaker! I love the separate compartment for the powder, so I can mix it later. It holds 12 oz and is plenty big for my shakes. I haven't had any leaks at all, while shaking or toting it around, and I haven't had any clumping problems. I also love the option of using the ice wand. This is the only shaker out there like it, and I'm completely satisfied with my purchase!"
2,Would be perfect if it did not leak,"I like the separate powder holder on the bottom of the shaker and the mixing ring works very well at breaking up any clumps, the removable ice packs are also a nice touch. But it is very easy to cross thread the cap and even when you get the cap on without cross threading it, the thing may leak all over you when you shake it. I bought six of these and I would say that I am disappointed with them mainly because of the leaking problem."
4,works,"the product does help to control the appetite temporarily. Works well in a ""slow"" weight loss program or to maintain your current weight"
5,Excellent History,This book provides and excellent and accurate view with pictures of how life was for blacks living in America before civil rights for all Americans became law.
4,New Metrical Psalter,"A good resource of Psalms and Canticles in metrical paraphrase, set to common hymn tunes. A good source of easy to sing materials, that I find usefull for small, liturgical churches that can not sing more complex settings without the benefit of a choir."
2,Leaves much to desire,The book provides a good chart of all of the Outlook 2000 objects but gives few good programming examples. Nowhere does it show how to login as an outlook user and then create and send an email. Spends too much time on the Outlook database vs. task list as if it were the only part of Outlook a developer would be interested. Not worth the money.
5,Great Gift,I bought this for my mother for Christmas - she is going to love it. Why would you require a certain amount of words?
5,Satisfying,"""Bad, bad Leroy Brown--baddest man in the whole..."" You know the rest. But do you know how many great songs Croce had?""Photographs & Memories"" is hidden from many people not realizing it is a greatest hits collection.""Operator"" is a sad confession of a man looking for a lover he's lost, and cries his tale for a dime. Yet, with ""Leroy Brown"" he's got a rock, almost country-folk quick pace. This ability to change tempos and styles is part of what vaults Croce to the top of music.""I Got a Name"" is a declaration of love, but also of independence. He doesn't want her following him around, but wants them to discover each other having the same passions and goals.This is a diverse collection of favorites. While Croce doesn't have the quantity of worthy tunes to fill a double CD, you'll find ""Photographs & Memories"" to be a satisfying listem.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.blogspot.com"
4,"Flair, fantasy, humor","Bias alert. I should start this review by saying that I am not sure that Zelazny could write a bad book. Non-Zelazny fans may disagree.Merlin is very clearly the son of Corwin. He is irreverent about the holy ghosts of Amber and Chaos. He hits his head against the rules (and sometimes even wins). Despite an overly-long sequence in a strange testing ground between shadows, Zelzany still infuses this book with the manic strangeness and humor that are part of what make him such a wonderful writer. As noted, virtually none of the Amber novels can be read stand-alone or out of sequence. You are going to have to read the books before this one to get the background. And you are going to have to read the ones after this to get an explanation. An enjoyable task, luckily."
3,Not on par with original Amber books,"Though you will not put the book down because of Mr. Zelazny's writing style. Do not expect the normal skilled plotting and crafted characterizations of the original Amber books. This book cannot stand alone...it leaves you hanging.Merlin, son of Corwin, who was the hero of the original series, narrates this sequence, and here continued to accidentlly make his way through encounters with new powers that are completely incompatible with the original mythos. Those who are allied with each other will not speak with each other. While their enemies somehow know everything. Most of the important action happens offstage, and promised explanations never materialize.So I would suggest you only read this book if you are a fan of the Amber series and have read the others that come before it."
1,Very bad quality!!! Don't buy.,Sigma watch has a very poor quality. I bought I PC7 one year ago and the first time I put it under the shower it stops working (it was supposed to be 3m water resistance). I sent to sigma and I have to pay for all transport expenses from (From China to Brazil).After 1 year the battery is down and the back is rusty (I have a 10 year old Casio watch that is used is swimming in pool and seawater and does not have any rusty).Don't recommend Sigma watches.
2,Sigma HRMonitor,This HRM was difficult to set and the calorie counter did not work consistently. The band was too big for my chest. I would not recommend it. I returned this item with no difficulty and purchased a POLAR HRM instead.
4,My daughter had this game for the PC,"MY daughter had this game for the PC when she was maybe 5 or 6. She loved it. The Playstation version is EXACTLY the same. In comparison to 2012, the graphics are crude but this game follows along with the animated Disney movie in may ways, though it is not a storybook adventure. My daughter had as much playing it at 18 as she did when she was little on the PC and it took us all back to her childhood. For a couple dollars, it was worth the investment."
5,Loved this book!,"I am 8 years old. I think this book is great for 10 and under readers. I recommend it for girls mainly. If you love dolls, you should read this fabulous book about them. It is easy to read...even a beginner could read this. (dictated to my mother!!!)"
2,not the book I thought I was getting,This isn't a good review because it wasn't the book I thought I was getting. I wanted a book from when I was a kid about a little girl who goes into her dollhouse. Can't find it...
5,This works!,"Im a consistant worrier;I also have a short attention span. After I found this book in a recovery store, I decided to buy a bunch more of the Elf-Help series. ""Worry Therapy"" still remains my favorite. The words are motivational, and the illustrations are intricate and adorable. I highly recommend it."
4,bp monitor,Very easy to use. You just put it in place and push a button. It inflates and deflates automatically. My doctor wants my bp readings every other day so the memory storage is another excellent feature. I just bring it to his office and he can see the readings for himself. I would recommend this product.
1,Not accurate at all,I figured this was a low cost unit that had good reviews so i bought one. It's reading 10-15 points higher when tested at the doctor's office. Being returned.
1,Disappointed,"At first I liked this product and felt the measurements were accurate. After a week and three uses the monitor just displayed error messages. No matter what I did and who I used it on it would read ""error"". For this reason I would probably not recommend it."
4,Great Tool; Easy to Use,"Although two consecutive readings might vary by about 10 mmHg, from day to day the readings I get from this device are just as consistent. I'll have to see when I next go to the doctor how close their reading is, but for now, it's a great tool. It's also stupidly easy to use! You just put it on and go, and it's really easy to access the memory of previous readings and their average as well. I love that it came with batteries, too. For $30, it seems like a great deal."
5,The real Tarzan,"Tarzan is back in an adventure more in tone with the remainder of the series than the original Tarzan novel. Sinister villains, lost races and beautiful priestesses are a mainstay of the series and this book introduces the best of all. Sinister villain-Nikolai Rokoff who would compromise his own sister's honor for money. Lost City-Opar, the remnant of sunken Atlantis. Beautiful priestess-La of Opar, who passionately chases our man Tarzan through several adventures.Tarzan is marooned near his jungle home and gravitates from civilized man to savage man to ape man over the course of the story. His realization that not all Arabs are sneering villains and not all blacks are cannibalistic headhunters is a welcome relief from the stereotypes that are usual in the series."
2,Disappointing but an Essential part of the Tarzan story,"Compared with the original Tarzan book, this story is disappointing. However, it contains essential information for the following Tarzan books."
3,Good read,"Very easy read and entertaining sequel. So far all his books I've read are the same style of writing, but they are still worth the few days to read."
3,"mmmmmmmm, love it","thanks, i cannot find this in any stores and have been seeking this product. arrived on time, priced right, just what i wanted! i'll be ordering again from you."
4,Great Beats and some good tracks,This will probally be in the Top 50 for the end of the year.Boog has a very nice Flow and can bring in some energy. He is not a great lyricist but does show some good promise in the future.Khrysis on the beats brings a ton of energy and for being a 9th Wonder his beats have more umph.There is a good number of good tracks on here expecially at the end of the LP.Lyrics 7 Production 9.5 Replay 8.5 Entertainment 8.5
1,defective,"I bought this for my 11 yr old daughter. It looked nice, but when I got it put together, I couldn't figure out the front brakes. I brought it to a certified bike shop, and they told me the rear wheel frame was bent and not fixable, that it was defective manufacturing issue, as well as the front brakes which were not fixable. By this time, I had already thrown the box away so have to pay $40 for a big bike box to ship back. Very disappointed, I didn't want to risk another one being shipped and that being defective."
2,"Lasted awhile, split and leaked","These lasted a few years, just used launching my boat. Then even though stored nicely indoors, developed massive cracks and are unusable. Would not buy again."
3,"It is winter, how can I rate using these hip waders?",I live in nothern NY everything is ice.The boots look like quality construction.I will not be able to use them until spring.I reserve to hold my opinion until I use the boots.
5,"If you get one Orb record, get this one.",The perfection of this record has led to disappointment after disappointment with their follow-up efforts. Get this one.
5,A Classic. Defined ambient for the 90's.,"Magnificent. A classic in the electronic music and ambient history. Groundbreaking at the time of its release. While we were just geeting used to KLF and marvelling at Enigma the Orb come along with this release and set the stage for chill out ambient music in the 90's. ""...Pulsating Orb"" is one of the best ambient tracks I've ever heard. The sheer beauty and simplicity of the track is unlike anything I had heard up until that point. This is not your father's ambient. Leaps and bounds beyond what Eno's stuff sounds like, not that Eno doesn't get his props either -- this is just a new twist on gerne."
2,"Great, if you like being bored.","I bought this on the strength of ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" and all the rave reviews. For the most part, however, my own scans suggest that the Ultraworld is devoid of life. With synthed out countdowns and mission control crosstalk, the Orb tries hard to convince you of the spacy, ""far out"" adventure they're taking you on. Then you look out the portal and realize you've never even left the launchpad. There just wasn't enough musical complexity or thematic change to pull me in and carry me along on the promised, ethereal journey. If you're looking for those elements in ambient electronica, you might want to try something from Patchwork or Alien Mutation and skip this 2-disc borefest."
4,Caution: There are two versions of this album!,"The version sold here is ""The Original Unedited UK release"" and has two CD's, despite Amazon's description of a single disc. There is an older version that came on only one disc, with different versions of the songs. (In my opinion that was the better version, but no one sells it). This is still excellent music, and I will be keeping it."
4,solid collection,"this collection pretty much runs the gamut of pogue hits, from whiskey, to lorelei, to summer in siam. it is a good collection for the beginner or not so rabid fan of the pogues (i fall into the latter category). yes it lacks the brilliant cohesiveness of rum sodomy and the and lash, or if i should fall from grace, and the songs have no particular order to speak of. you lose the energy of the earlier albums and spirit that was so preciously captured. however, this is a collection and as such falls prey to the same weaknesses they all do. the creative genius of the band is here though (in diluted fashion), and this makes it a worthy purchase in itself."
4,Good stuff...,"I've got two, they work well and have for a long time. When/if they stop working Monster will replace 'em free. Lifetime no hassle replacement guarantee. All my guitar cables, speaker cables etc.? Monster. Love it."
2,A Bit Disappointed,"I bought multiple copies of this book to use with fifth grade students. It is short chapters--snippets of things that happened with the pilgrims. Very factual and somewhat dry. Towards the end of the book, it gets difficult to keep all of the Native American chiefs separated. I don't think I'll use it again. The kids did not enjoy it at all. If you're looking for a pilgrim book, The Diary of Remember Patience Whipple is much better."
3,Surface Glare,This is an attractive thermometer but the glare from the clear cover makes it difficult to read for much of the day.
2,No flow,"I bought this because it is stainless steel and leak-proof. It's true that it doesn't leak, but when it's open, you ought to be able to get the beverage out. When the top is set to open, is has a slow leak (almost a drip) of liquid out. It's impossible to get a real sip out of this thing without taking the top off altogether!"
2,No leak and no heat,"The mug doesn't leak; that's good, but the liquid cools quickly, too quickley. Drink fast!"
2,Hand wash only.,"It's possible I missed it in other people's reviews, but this is a hand-wash only mug. Additionally, the whole open/close knob on the lid doesn't really perform as one would want. In my case, the darn thing just always stays closed. Yet again, I've been beat down by ""improvements"". Next time, I'll buy a mug that doesn't have moving parts."
4,Nice substitute for an expensive tailgate,"When I bought a new truck I had to look for a Fifth Wheel tailgate. So being the ""cheapskate"" I am, I looked for the lowest priced but effective tailgate I could find. And at about 50 dollars, the Turbo Net was just what I was lookin' for. The net works fine. Although the small paper instruction was not to helpful. But with help from wife I figured it out. Although the instructions noted that you needed furniture polish, it did not explained why. After getting the wife's help, the furniture polish was needed to rub on the top and bottom poles so the material can slip through. Impossible to slip the top pole in without the polish. Also I thought it explained before I ordered it, that only two holes were needed to be drilled. When in fact four was needed -at least on mine-. Anyway the net does serve the purpose. Now that work is done, it is easy to attach and detach from the truck, and easy to store."
3,Cute idea but wouldn't buy again...,"I typically love leapfrog products and they have all worked perfectly out of the box and lasted a really long time. This particular item I bought as soon as it came out and immediately didn't work. I also think it's really geared to the 3-6 month age as it's very babyish and extremely simple and my son was just too old for it (he was about 9 months when I bought it probably my mistake) but either way, I've seen better."
2,Expected More from Leap Frog,"The buttons weren't defined enough for ~6month old. LOVE the idea but there didn't seem to be enough to identify the individual keys. When it ""times out"" or is shut off it always goes back to the shape/color mode. Doesn't stay on selected mode. Son now 2 keeps going back to this toy with interest but didn't seem great for younger child."
5,BEAUTIFUL JOE,"This story is about a pup who's mother had died because of the masters abuse, she also died of how tierd she was. This man had a familiy and worked as a milk man for a town, his cows were in terrible shape though. They lived in a muddy shelter, and had bad food. They cows one day started processing bad milk, so soon the people got sick. The pup one day became brave enough to pay the milk man back, so he bit him. But the man took the now teenage dog and cut his ears off near his head, and cut off his tail as well. A man on his bike heard and saw the man abuseing his dog, and brought the dog home with him. The children at his was shocked by what they saw. Then they named him beautiful joe after trying to figure out names. From that day on they took care of the dog and had many adventures."
3,Good but brief,"This book covers the basics of linux. It will help the beginner setup their system and get the basic applications and server software running. I would recommend this book only to the person who is new to linux AND generally take more time grasping computer concepts. Although the book went into many different topics of linux, none of them were really in depth enough to give the reader a understanding of what was going on(kind of a do this and this will result book). Which is ok unless you have any problems. then you will find yourself stuck and searching through other countless documentations."
5,"Buy this book if dont even know what ""Linux"" is!","Its great for a user that is new to the wonderful world of open-source operating systems. If until now your experience with operating eyetems has been limited to Windows, then get this book!The author does a great job of explaining the often-tedious process of installation in plain easy-to-understand english!This book will get you started and have you running Linux in your machine in no time. Although if you want details and want to go into more depth, a book like Running Linux by the same publication will come in handy."
2,Installation guide not working,"I have just bought this book based on many of the good reviews about this book's easy way to install the Red Hat Linux. Yes, I did install the Linux smoothly under my Windows XP. And I even created the boot disk since I don't want to ruin my XP system. However, after I completed installation and rebooted my laptop. The screen showed an error message of Boot Failed. (and that's it). I have tried to contact Oreilly and the reply was very cold. So if you are a total newbie such like me and if you really want to install your Red Hat successfully and USE it, try picking another one."
4,Meet your computer.,"This book is quite helpful for any ""new to computer"" people. I used this book to teach a summer school class how to efficiently use the Windows 98 program. It went well. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a better understanding of computers."
3,Cat 'Dummie' Book,"This little book, and it is little, gives all the basics on bringing up kitty. If you never knew anything about cats, this will help you. If you know something about them, but are looking for a particular sub heading, buy another book. This one doesn't give specifics, only basics."
1,Unevenly written and dangerous book,"I bought this book because of the Peter Norton name. Now I am starting to wonder whether he has much familiarity with Windows98. The book is rather superficially written, and does not go into specifics if you are actually trying to fix something, or get something to work. If you wish to get Direct Cable Connection to work, for example, I would look elsewhere. Some things in this book are just dangerous. The authors suggest that the reader run a utility called LFNBK.EXE from the Windows CD. I did as they suggested and my computer was rendered unusable! The proper utility that performs what they describe is SULFNBK in the Windows\Command directory. Anyway, after that experience, I have lost all confidence in the book."
2,ok but it's not all that,I was very disappointed with this game. The camera angles make it very difficult to move and it is hard to tell from the animation whether you are standing on the ground or floating in the air. I enjoyed the premise but was glad that I rented it before I purchased.
4,"Good sheets, poorly dispensed.","The box dispenser needs work. Or else the perforations need to be deeper between each square so that they break free more easily when pulled. Invariably I have a wrench or a greasy part in one hand, and have to wrestle with the box to pull out a single paper with the other hand. I will keep them, use them up, and probably order again, but may put an old starter motor on the box so it will stay put while I snap a towel out of there."
5,One of the best philosophical socialist books,"You wouldn't think it, but this little baby packs a huge radical punch. Written in 1929 after the Depression set in it's Dewey's testament on what he thought society would have to do to solve that kind of systemic problem and survive. What comes out from Dewey's experiential philosophy is a radical critique of individualism that fit's into the category today of ""Council Communism"" or ""Autonomous Marxism"", meaning socialism which is concieved according to Marxist type theory but is realized according to radically democratic and workerist means. A forgotten gem, read this and then absorb the liberatory potential of the rest of Dewey's many philosophical works."
5,Wildflower,This is music is to relax with. Music that calms you down and forget about all your bad day events.
1,Filmsy Product,"Due to the price, I didn't have too high expectations when ordering, but the product came nowhere near the quality I'd hoped.The only thing that seems to work correctly is the thermometer, the hydrometer and barometer don't work, period.The gauges are poorly constructed and are loose in the wood frame, the ""brass finish"" is just gold painted plastic--the whole thing has a cheap overall feel to it--same quality you might expect when paying under $5 for something like this.I'd seriously consider going with a different product than this one if you're in the market for a home weather station."
3,This is okay... nothing exciting.,"I've you've used BIND much at all and are familair with DNS and how it works a little, and have just read the install, readme, etc. files, you probably won't get much out of this book. BIND has a lot of options and there's a lot to discuss, but this book just covered a lot of basics over a lot of pages. It may be a good source for learning, but I wasn't reading it to learn from start."
3,O'Reilly misses one.,"O'Reilly misses the mark with DNS and BIND. I have several shelf full of O'Reilly books and I think this one is far over complecated. The first example has about 12 machines that need to be configured, what about showing how to set up a caching name server? I have many books from O'Reilly that I have thought were a lot better."
3,Cheap Copy Transfer,Love Mission Impossible but they did the cheap copy transfer on this set.The original series are clean & crisp.This series was not done that way. Looks like a transfer from VHS tapes to me.Also Amazon wants too much money.Bought it cheaper at Walmart.
4,Long waited,"I don't how long I waited for this to come out.The first few episodes are remake of the original series, due to the writers strike.One thing I found amusing is the gadgets are more advanced and more high-tech flavored, reflecting the 15 years that has gone by.Open reel tape is replaced by optical disc, picking devices are computerized, and so on.Well, Jim is a little older and wrinkled, but still demonstrates his backbone as the team leader.If you are the fan of the original MI, you will enjoy.If you like Tom Cruise version of MI better, don't bother.One disappointment, as few others pointed out, is the picture quality.It is OK, but not as good as what you would expect after seeing the digitally re-mastered DVDs of the original series.So I had to deduct a point for that"
3,Some of the Worst Edditing Ever,I've read a lot of poorly edited kindle books but this is one of the worst. Whoever converted this from a printed item to ebook mangled it. The formatting is crazy and it results in a book that's hard to follow.The book itself is an interesting series of articles that are at times interesting. At other times it bores you to tears but I think some of that is a result not knowing where one article begins and another ends.I'd like to see a cleaned up version of this book. I think it would be a much more enjoyable read.
3,Good book for absolute begginers,"The book is ok for begginers. It will guide you along the UI BeOS programming, but not much farther. The code also, does not compile always and I think this is because its been written on BeOS for PPC..."
2,"Not to shabby, but I'd take the online BeBook over it...","When I heard that this book was coming out, I couldn't wait to get it (in fact I pre-ordered it from Amazon). I have to admit that its a bit of a disappointment now that I've gotten through a good portion of the book.While what it does cover is explained fairly well, the book is quite weak in many areas. While it gives a fairly good introduction into programming for Be, it doesn't go into detail where it really matters. The book lacks depth when introducing the reader to the ways of the Be API. No attempt is made at explaing how to create custom controls, not to mention that the book doesn't even cover all the controls made available in the Be API. While it does offer a fairly decent explaination of some of the Interface Kit, I'd say shy away from this one and spend your money on the other BeBooks by O'Reilly.Here's to some better beginner's documentation!"
4,The definative work,"If you plan on programming on BeOS systems this is the book. It is slightly dated, but not too much to be useful. That is its only shortcoming. The book is easy to follow and very informative.BeOS is a great system to program for, though Be Inc. hard financial times has relegated this OS to more of a hobbiest OS than a commerical product."
4,Nice autobiography of Gale Sayers,"I read this book many years ago, when it first came out. Background and context for my interest: I have been a Chicago Bears' fan since elementary school; Gale Sayers and Dick Butkus, on the same team at the same time, are among my favorite Bears of all time; the story of Brian Piccolo was poignant as I followed his illness and death so long ago.This book does a nice job showing how Sayers moved from childhood and challenges to becoming a nationally known college football player to joining the Chicago Bears. The book does a fine job outlining his career with the Bears, including the story of Brian Piccolo. It also covers the devastating knee injury that wrecked his career (although he would have one very successful year after that surgery).All in all, a nicely done work."
5,Just like I rememered it.,"I loved every minute of it, all over again.Growing up in England and going to Public schools really brings back the memories. The acting and story lines are riveting, you can't wait to get back to it.You will love this one and watch it many times over as I will."
4,Convenient,We use these at our church so there's no taking rags home to wash. So conveniet and one Scott rag will wash all the dishes and do the clean up without falling apart. Then we just toss 'em when we're done. Great product.
1,outdated,"book haS NO USE TO ME EVERYTHING IN IT YOU CAN FIND ON THE INTERNET,..ITS ALL OUTDATED WASTE OF MONEY"
1,this book is not very helpful,this book doesn't help very much. He offers no variations on the garden plans. Nearly all of the information in here is common knowledge. I do not reccomend this book.
5,Great band,"Why didn't I heard about this band?Back in the seventies listened STYX,KANSAS,SUPERTRAMP and the likes,but I never heard about ANGEL. Thanks for these reissues I accidentally stumbled on them.What a treat.All 4 albums are great and if you like seventies music,you must buy ANGEL. they A RE FANTASTIC."
3,RUSH,GOOD MOVIE ALWAYS LIKED IT BUT ONE THING ITS NOT FULL SCREEN - BOUGHT A VHS TAPE OF IT ITS FULL SCREEN
2,still waiting/finally got it,"I've order this product on the 15th of august and today is the 29th of august and i still don't have the product. I dont know why its taking so long, maybe because i live in hawaii. Well this might be the last time i order this product from this company, as far as the product....we'll seen WHEN it comes inOK update! 9/6/12i got my product in on the 6th of sept. REALLY 22 days from the time i order it to it reaches my house UNREAL.i emailed the company and dude name Dane said i'll be gladly to help ""what's your order #"" i gave it to him and he never responded, i guess he looked on his computer and probably showed that it was already here in hawaii, at least let me know. Sometimes small things like that makes a BIG difference, he also gave me this 800 number to call but whats the point he was useless over all the product work great which i expected. i had to give them a 2 star. sorry get the product from someone else."
3,the inspiration of one women,"All cheb Hasni`s songs evolve around one woman,some times she`s blond(bayda) and others tanned (zarga).Hasni`s songs come in the forme of rymed lyrics and poemes spiced with love to the extent of crasiness(mousiba)and the end of life .The love or MOUSIBA has not only inspired hasni`s artistic side but has given him something more sacred,his son ABD ALLAH.to tell the truth.Hasni`s songs are the lyrics of millions of north maghrebian youth.the fact which makes HAsni not only the spokes man of these youth but the king of RAI."
4,It Does What It's Supposed To Do,"It's easy to mount outside. It's easy to read from inside the house. It's accurate, based on local temperature information. What else could you want in an inexpensive outdoor thermometer?"
1,Use it for target practice!,"This thing is so flimsy it will probably break if you fart next to it! Arrived cracked and scratched,no packing around it. Had 10-piece screwdriver set in same box with 4 layers of bubble wrap around them! go figure. Very cheaply made, not worth 14 dollars. No problem with refund though."
5,Easy to read C and F grade. Visible large numbers from inside the house in to the back patio.,"Easy to read C and F grade. Visible large numbers from inside the house in to the back patio. Defiantly recommended to others,"
2,patio clock,the face cover fell off trying to hang it and it is about 7 degrees hiher than it should shouldnt have ordered it my fault should have read the reviews
2,pretty cheap...,"Out of the sun, it's pretty accurate, but in full sun the thermometer max out at 120 on an 85 degree day. I'm going to relocate it on a fence, out of the sun, covered in ivy, more as a curiosity then a functioning thermometer."
1,Shame on Rhino!,"What other reviewers have noted is correct: the various performances on these DVDs are not necessarily complete, and, for a $143.99 price tag, there should be a LOT more material! Only 9 DVDs for that price is alone insane, but in addition the individual DVDs are lacking in terms of minutes/hours presented. The only way this set even manages a one-star rating from me is because there are some great and historical performances included, incomplete or otherwise. A fair price for this set would probably be in the $10-$20 range. Unfortunately, Rhino's price on this item is the epitomy of price-gouging."
2,Didn't like it - recommend others,"I've had several rain gauges, some in this class and some better, but this is one of my least favorites, along with a Timex unit.Comparing readings with my other gauges, including my ""pro"" one, this unit seems to read high... but the most annoying thing is that this one is relatively fragile and it did not stay put when mounted to a fence. The mounting options for this unit are very poor. If you are sticking it in the ground or using it to measure water for a sprinkler system then it would probably be better.If you want a cheap rain gauge, then I recommend theChaney Instrument 5-Inch Capacity Easy-Read Magnifying Rain GaugeIf you want a ""real"" rain gauge, but still not what I would consider expensive, then I recommend theStratus RG202 Long Term Professional Rain and Snow Gauge."
1,Not the best,"I must confess at the onset that I never finished this book. In my youth, I tried to read this book many times and I just couldn't. I kept trying because I loved Krishna and wanted to read about him. I have read other books on Krishna. (My favorite being the ""Wisdom of God"" by Swami Prabhavananda). Every time I tried to read this book my head would feel strained. It was like the author was trying too hard. Other books of the stories of Krishna would inspire me and melt my heart. This book just gave me a headache. For a devotee of Krishna, he is completely cerebral. This book is so heady that there is little room in it for heart. He tries to be from the heart. His language is from the heart. But the feeling from the book is dry and heady. I have read other books by Swami Prabhupada and I get the same feeling. His books just seem a little too strained."
2,poor design,"The basin of the sink doesn't totally drain of water and has to be wiped out every time you use is. This is a design flaw as my previous sink of the same size didn't do this.Crane Plumbing 1618V-100 Carla Self-Rimming Drop-In Lavatory Sink, White"
1,TO MANY THINGS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME,"I FELT THIS MOVIE WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND THE DIRECTOR SHOULD NEVER DIRECT AGAIN!!!! IT TRIED TO PUT EVERYBODY'S LIFE IN THE MOVIE, INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING ON GLOVER AND KLINE."
4,As is life,This movie successfully intertwines real life - full of the good and bad - and guides us to the realization that good must overcome the bad. We must live each day as if it were our last because it just might be. I have read many reviews of this movie and no one even mentions the helicopter - so did they not notice it? I believe the helicopter with the light shining down over the city represents an ever present God watching over His people? What do you think?
3,Suspense,"The author of this book, Kathy Herman, is very popular with our church library readers, so this book was bought for the library. So far, it has not been read."
3,Good book but fate exists,"This psychologist is in no way qualified, no one is, to suggest there is no fate. Many people have seen and felt fate operating.Yes, it is a good thing to work hard and envision a future without giving way to doubt, but how can this guy sit back and claim to know if fate exists or not. That is egomaniacal. Why is this man not an emperor if he can just will his way to ultimate success? He is a low-level author at best.I think it is good to be positive, but listen to this book with a grain of salt. It makes me mad to hear this guy be so confident in debunking what billions of humans have believed in in the past. Still, I believe you need to listen to differing viewpoints.I did not want to believe in fate, but sometimes, it just is. If you are talented but fate has other plans for you, no amount of kicking and screaming will break the glass ceiling.I would assert that a CEO made it through hard work, but also was not tripped up by fate."
5,Hot and Ready,Ele has done a wonderful job pon di cd and all who no like it fi go sit down. Elephant man is the next big ting in dancehall. JA should be so proud. Big ups to Ele and keep doin what you doin. He soon knock Sean Paul out and if you can't understand it then don't listen to it. You fi close your ears.
4,Good dancehall like only ELE can bring,Ele is well know for his dancehall all over the world and has been a dancehall icon for a long time. This cd is no exception and is quickly getting good reviews. His songs have great energy and good beats. This cd is overall pretty good. Some of the cd is alittle bit more laid back then some of his older stuff. If you like dancehall this is a cd you can pop in listen to without looking for the skip button. Also try some of his older cds they are tight too!!
1,Don't waste you time,"I liked the book up to page 83. Beginning on page 84 it loses all sense of explanation and becomes sheer mumbo jumbo. As just one example; no explanation is given as to why the whole notes are written both on lines and also then in between lines,and how to read them in relation to middle ""C"". The rest of Chapter six then begins to speed up and like a starship and it moves into lightning speed making the book worthless past page 83. Feel like I wasted my money. P.S. Blake Neely's AOL email address is invalid."
5,I found this book EXTREMELY helpful,"I owe this book a lot - this is the book that got me started playing the piano, all by myself.But, beware, this book is not recommended for everyone - it has A LOT of chit-chat before c'tting to the chase and get that bloddy piece played already, but I found it helpful.This books gives you some really solid ground to take off from - it covers chords(not only the easy and simple C, F, G, etc...), teaches you notes, rhythm and everything you need to know.It's not like any other piano book, it has more text in it than notes.But I loved it.5 stars."
2,Helped Very Little,"I was expecting this book to help my playing,But it helped very little. It seemed like I was reading more than even touching the piano. The book is a ok referance book, but didn't explain some of the important things in enough detail. So it really wasn't what I was looking for in a self-teaching book."
2,really for dummies...,"It was my first ""for dummies"" book and most probably the last. The book is big and empty; the author should have used at most 50 pages. The CD contains short musical clips that you've probably heard before or you can download for free. I gave it two stars because the book actually helps a small tiny bit contrary to its size.I recommend instead ""Alfred's Group Piano for Adults"" it's much better but I'm not sure if it's the best one out there."
4,great little smoker,This is my first smoker. I purchased before reading the reviews. I thought I was going to have problems. I assembled it according to directions and started using it. I have had it for 2 months and have used it at least twice a week. It works great. The only thing is if you are doing something large that takes awhile you will have to keep an eye on the charcoal. I did not have to drill any holes or modify it in any way. I expect to have this smoker for a long time.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is it could have been packed better.
1,very dissapointed,i broke a piece putting it together and cannot order a new part because char-broil does not answer the phone and you cannot order a new part online been 3 weeks everyday calling and no answer. Will never buy another char-broil product again.
2,All about rights....,"De reason why they cut some videoclips is all about rights. As you noticed this dvd came out on a major. In some cases , some of the rights of the performing artists on this dvd are not with this company. However, to get clearance, they have to cut it down, so if you want the whole version, you simply have to buy it from the company where the rights are...I think this is very bad, specially if you see the price tag....."
3,Factual but Ponderous,"Wilcox does a yoeman's job of presenting the inside details of a Navy fighter squadron's operations and culture, but to a fault.I found the book a ""page turner"" in a manner of speaking. By about halfway through, I started scanning and turning pages to find some aspect of squadron life that hadn't already been covered several times before. They fly a mission; they get shot at; they drop bombs; they talk to each other with funny call signs; they return to the ready room and yell at each other. Over and over again. The author's repeated details of each mission, and use of inscrutible call signs made the reading ponderous.What I took away from the book was the impression that Navy pilots are largely thrill seekers with big egos who don't like to be disagreed with; an impression not consistent with my own three years aboard a carrier.If you want to read this book, buy a used copy. It's not one that will live long in your reference library."
2,My time wasn't completely wasted...,"I was able to google some stuff while my hubby watched the movie. I thought it was ""unusual"". I did enjoy watching Kong's emotions though. That was probably the best part."
1,What A Joke! And not even a funny one!,"Cabot, Armstrong, Wray, the rest of the cast and the crew of the original King Kong must be turning over in their graves. What the heck were the new cast and crew thinking when they made this piece of ????. Come on, King Kong sliding/skating around on an ice pond holding Ann in his hand!? Denham acting like a buffoon the entire show! Driscoll looking like he should have been a scout troop leader (Girl's). And Ann, well she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, much less scream like Fay Wray did in the original. What a letdown. With all the money and technology available today this could have been a blockbuster. Sad, Sad, Sad."
2,coulda been great,"Its too bad because this film could have been great. The special effects were awesome but as VanHelsing proved , it takes more than that to make a good film. There was just too many scenes that were over the top and unrealistic, like the Brontosaurus scene with our actors running between their legs but incredibly never getting hurt. Cmon guys. In the end You never really care enough about Kong to get sad because there were too many scenes that were ridiculous. The most important element to the film was the romance between woman and beast, and this could have worked, in fact I was praying it would, but it failed because there were too many implausible scenes earlier on, too many ridiculous scenes involoving humans outrunning dinosaurs and what not. Worth seeing, but Ive got to give it a thumbs down. More than anything I was disappointed. The synopsis of the film was: ape meets girl ,ape loses girl, ape tries to get girl back but falls off big building."
3,King Kong Extended Version a bit too extended.,I enjoyed the movie particularly the parts with Naomi Watts Dancing for Kong. In the end however I was ready for the movie to be over before when they captured Kong. I hung on and watched the New York section of the flick but I really wouldn't have missed much if they would have cut the movie right there.
2,Pete Jackson Has A Problem,"This movie has some really good acting in it.I would watch it just to see Naomi Watts. She is a baby doll.That said: Peter Jackson could screw up a wet dream. Everything that he touches is WAY too long. This movie could have been shortened by a LOT. Many of the scenes are dragged out way too far, and some of the stuff going on in the jungle is just ridiculous.The Lord of The Rings trilogy is a great example. i loved those three movies, but I fast forwarded through at least a third of them. Who in hell wants to watch three little guys walking around all the time and the sentimental music playing in the background as they smile stupidly.The man has a problem. He may be tying to compensate for something that isn't quite long enough. :p"
1,"Great movie, bad price!","I made the mistake of ordering this HD DVD on Amazon thinking it would not be in my local store. To my surprize I found dozens of HD DVD movies at Wal-Mart for 19.99 including this one. With shipping I paid over $32. I WILL NOT be ordering DVD's, or CD's from this site again! Shame on you Amazon!"
2,Should have been better,"THe most exciting part of this movie is the middle when they are looking for Kong. The cinematography and the ""new"" creatures were interesting. OTher than that they blew it. The beginning was slow and few new things were added to the story to make it interesting. The ending was bad, all I remember is a whole bunch of people running in the steets in broad daylight. There was so much more they could have done to make the story more interesting, this was a half-hearted effort."
2,Falls flat,"Peter Jackson is a talented filmmaker and I was excited to delve into this extended edition of King Kong. Unfortunately, this film has been overhyped and falls flat when all is said and done. There is no doubt that some of the action scenes are outstanding and the cinematography is nice. What brings the film down is the fact that it is needlessly long. The first hour is boring at times and could have been easily condensed. While the action scenes are done well, they sometimes drag on to the point they are not as exciting as they should have been. By the end of the film I was honestly hoping the film would just end."
3,Good but too long,This movie is well made but it is way to long. For one thing they certainly could have shorted the stuff with then going to the island and staying there that part of the movie lasted 90 minutes. The only human in this movie that were any good was noami watts the stuff with her and kong was well done. Jack black was annoying as usual and andrian brody does not have the looks to play this leading man type character i would perfered someone that look more like he came from the 30s. The good about this movies is the stuff that takes place in New York city and the stuff with Kong.
3,so-so,"This movie had the potential to be an excellent movie. It updated the old King Kong with all the modern film-making techniques. The camera work, the special effects, etc. were all brilliant. The acting was easily above par. Someone, however, in production, needed to edit out some things. Most of the too-long movie was made up of scenes of King King running around, etc. Almost every scene was just too long. The movie-makers need to learn to get the plot moving, and cut out the rest, especially when a movie like that is going for so long."
1,bad,this movie was so bad. The only part I enjoyed was when they got to the island and it showed the tribe. After that its all downhill. I left the flick before it was done. I should have demanded my money back.
5,Excellent,"Peter Jackson has done it again. One of my favorite movies of all time. I love a long movie that is not rushed, wish they all were 3 hours plus."
2,Now if only the other actors were CGI too...,"I'm not quite sure what Peter Jackson was going for with the performances. I understand the film is a throwback to the original but I don't think having the actor's perform the way they did in 1933 helped the picture in any way, shape or form.The relationship between Ann Darrow and Brody's character is non-existent, forced, stupid, with absolutely no real human connection. Jack Black is atrocious- moving your eyebrows a lot is not good acting, in case he didn't know.The sort of pederastic relationship between Jimmy and his big friend was weird and absurd.The writing... an insult to anyone's intelligence.If special effects could make a movie, I would give it five stars, but it can't, so I won't. At least Peter lost a lot of weight making it!"
2,Nice Try,"I love Peter Jackson's movies, but this one is largely an over-produced bomb. It's more about his ego than good film making.Many of the details added to the backstory are interesting, but the Skull Island (Mordor,anyone?) sequences drag on and on and on and on... There are some great moments, but, for instance the scene with Kong and the three t-rexes is waaaaaaaay too long, as is the ""bug"" scene; and does every single nasty creature have to have big teeth? The only reason to see this film to see how a great director can go so terribly wrong."
4,How the heck do you get a 50 ton monkey on a ship with half a crew?,"I had no idea of the length of this movie until half way into it without a monkey. Two hours into it I'm thinking they still need to get Kong to NYC. Many parts are confusing, many parts don't make sense, however, it is worth seeing for the good parts, of which there are a few. I suppose I'll have to watch it a few more times to figure it out. Maybe that's the plan."
2,"NO NEED TO BUY, AND I""LL TELL YOU WHY... :)","For all of you people who felt that the almost 3 hour running time of this film, was lacking in length, then there's good news for you!It would appear that KONG is going the way of the Lord Of The Rings DVDs, which means that the original theatrical version gets released first, and then several months later (just enough time for people to have forgotten that they already shelled out big bucks to own this thing, months before) a 4 disc, extended version, will be making it's appearance around the holiday season.Let's all hear it for, Double Dipping...(Hey, I'm still waiting for the 10 hour cut, of the Godzilla remake, to make its appearance... :)"
3,KING KONG REVIEW,"This film was pretty good. It wasn't great, it wasn't horrible, but it was pretty good. It doesn't have the same feel as the 1930's version, but it is pretty good, nonetheless. One of the things I really didn't like, is that the natives of Skull Island are demon possessed zombies. The exotic creatures are awesome, but I never really did like King Kong. I watched this for the special effects, and it was worth it, except, King Kong is a Gorilla with a grey back, instead of just black. I'm going to like Nacho Libre a lot more now, after seeing Jack Black fight in this film. Kind of weird though..."
1,What has Peter Jakson Done!!!!????,"I Love Peter Jackson's movies, except this one. This movie Is to horrible to express in words. I think that this has to be one of the worst movies next to the new superman movie. In both movies they did not think things through. Yah you can say the special effects are good, and they are. But effects don't make a movie good unless the story is good. If I could I would give this movie a half star, and that's genoris onl because people say the effects rock, but I could not care less about special effects."
1,horrible special effects,"Maybe they looked cool in the theatre, but at home this movie just looked absolutely horrible. It was really lame and boring, despite it's having lots of fight scenes. I have to admit I actually turned it off 2 hours into it. Really sucked."
2,MOVIE STARTS OUT GREAT......BUT DISSAPOINTING,"I""VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL KING KONG. I COULD NOT WAIT TO SEE THIS REMAKE, THE TRAILER SEEMED TO SHOW THAT THIS VERSION FOLLOWED THE ORIGINAL STORY.............BUT THEN COMES THE STUPID PARTS SUCH AS THE YOUNG LADY IN THE FAY WRAY ROLL DOING TRICKS HAND STANDS, AND JUGGLING FOR A SIX STORY APESOME HOW ,THAT PART OF THE STORY JUST DOEST WASH........I LOST ALL MY INTEREST FROM THAT POINT ON..........THE BATTLE OF THE PREHISTORIC CREATURES AND SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE THE ONLY SAVING GRACE FOR AN ALMOST GREAT MOVIE......."
2,Too much of a CGI fest,"Just watched KK for the first time. Unaware of the pointless nature of most of the film. I never believed that any of the characters had any personal business on Skull Island.The bugs, dinosaurs, and weird evil natives were as overdone as burnt toast that sets off the smoke alarm. There were too few scenes that would give the movie any positive spin. You know bad guys smashed or something. The point of the movie according to Mr. Jackson was that bugs, people, and dinosaurs are evil and that KK is an overgrown primate trapped in world that tortures him daily and finally kills him. Oh, yeah the movie is great if you would like a CGI headache."
5,Utterly Incredible!,I saw this movie eight times when it was in theaters and each time i loved it. Of course this movie is nothing to the orignal 1933 King Kong but its a hell of a movie none the less. I was completely blown away by the F/X and the realism of Kong is unlike anything i have ever seen. Granted there were (in my opinion) some things that could have been left out but over all i think the movie is a momumental achivement. Also (personally) i would have casted another person to play Denim because i am not a huge Jack Black fan but i am utterly tounge-tied about this movie and how much i enjoyed it. A +++
3,Jackson overdid it,"This movie obviously tries to become a classical movie. The pictures and the acting performances are perfect and it is difficult to believe, that Kong isn't a real gorilla..but I think they shouldn't have given Peter Jackson such an enormous budget for this movie as he put in way too much computer material. Watching a supergorilla would have been enough already...Having dinosaurs from Jurassic Park and huge insects from Eight legged Freaks there at the same time simply is too much. Undoubtedly the movie is great to watch, but personally I believe the story of King Kong isn't interesting enough to make a blockbuster out of it. I only hope no one is thinking of a sequel.(SARR)"
2,Eye candy with not much depth,"I was kind of dragged to this movie, and have to say that had I been alone, I would have left halfway through. The special effects were ridiculous (come on, the girl was flung around like a rag doll and not one bruise on her body? And don't get me started on the dinosaur stampede...). Most of the special effects besides Kong were very obvious, and there was an overabundance of huge, creepy creatures that would only attack once the actors woke up. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the relationship between King Kong and Naomi Watts' character."
4,"Long, but better than expected","I got talked into watching a movie that I didn't really want to see. The good thing is that I found it to be more interesting than I would have guessed. Like many others, I felt that is was long. I feel there were at least two or three segments that could have been shortened while still accomplishing what was needed or essential to the movie. In general, I am not too interested in remakes of classics, so I decided to do this review for others that may have a spouse or friend that talks them into it. I think it will be better than you thought. Just make sure you have your popcorn and drinks."
3,King Kong...,"I attended the movie on 12/17/2005. Peter Jackson's treatment of ""King Kong"" deserves kudos. The special effects were top rate, along with the dialog, cinematography and good acting, and it's action scenes!Even though I've seen the original, this movie also deserves credit for it's take on a familiar theme! Check it out if you get a chance! I give this movie three stars!"
1,Disappointed,"Returned the product as it did not work. Tried this video on 2 HD TVs, one small flat screen and a new computer, and it did not load and play."
3,"Great movie, lame dvd","I really enjoyed this movie, but I was actually looking forward to the usual Peter Jackson behing-the-magic info on the dvd, and Surprise! there are no special features to speak of, only a commercial(!). No thanks. Definitely a rental, not a purchase!!"
1,Remake Of A Remake,"This version of King Kong is basically a remake of the 1976 Jessica Lange disaster while mocking the 1933 film at the same time.The special effects are poor.Especially during the scene were the sailors are being chased by a herd of Brontosaurus.Jack Black is obviously mis-cast.The film on the whole is just way too long.Call the 1933 film CORNY if you like but it is still the best film of it's kind.To make things worse, this DVD release is not true Widescreen.Looks like the film was cut at the top and bottom to give the appearance of widescreen."
3,"Excellent movie and reference quality HD treatment, but...","This movie was the main reason I bought into the whole HD DVD thing. As one of my favorites of 2005, I highly anticipated its release to HD, especially since I figured it would get one heck of a treatment. I was right about part of it; the A/V quality is among the best I've seen, despite the lack of a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack. It's definitely the title I'd use to show off what HD DVD can do; however, the lack of extras is a little disappointing, mainly because Amazon has it priced so darn high. 27 bucks is way too much for the title, when other new releases have sub-$20 price tags.Bottom line: the HD DVD comes highly recommended, but only if you can get it for a more reasonable price."
4,Visually stunning HD DVD with a so-so plot.,"This HD DVD is arguably the king of HD DVD demo material right now. The colors are sharp and vibrant, and the film is crystal clear. The audio is just as good. The only reason I took a star off is because the actual movie script is decent at best. Adrian Brody does a pretty good job, but overall the movie's plot is average. Luckily, I bought this movie for the stunning visual experience, so I'm not disappointed."
4,Great! Simply put.,"Ok there are movies that get bad reviews that I just dont get, this is one of the movies. This is a great action/adventure movie. I had my doubts about Jack Black, but he really does deliver as does the rest of the cast. Kong was a lot fun. Before being turned off by sitting thru a 3 hour long movie, set aside a night make some pop corn and just sit back and watch it. The 3 hours will fly by and you will be amazed."
3,Better than I thought it would be,"It was interesting, better than I thought it would be; the best scene was King Kong fighting the dinosaurs. Frank Black's performance was horrible, though-- not believable in the least. Worth the $2.99, but not more than that."
1,I want my 3 hours back,"I've liked what PJ has done in the past (Dead Alive, Bad Taste, LOTR, etc...), but this is the worst remake I've ever subjected myself to. I knew how the story went from the original Kong, but come on... PJ didn't have to drag on every minute of it to make it more then it already was. I really looked forward to seeing this film, but after seeing it I asked myself if it really happend and felt that I needed a hot shower to forget I ever saw it."
2,seems like an unspecified struggle with herself,"I don't know. It'ts a struggle for her to come up with the next line. Doesn't feel especially creative, inspired, or notably intelligent. I read other disappointed reviews people had written about this book, & bought it anyway. I tend to have avant-garde sensibilities, so I thought I'd enjoy it for its avant-garde qualities. I really tried to appreiate the experimentality of it, but I couldn't, because I realised I was readin it more for the sake of reading, & because I enjoy reading,than because this book is any good. I know a lot of unskilled teenagers who write dada-influenced poetry that's much more interesting than this uninspired book; I don't see what makes Anne Carson so special. 1 star because it's not a good book. 1 more star, bringing the total to 2, because I feel bad just giving it 1 star. At least she wrote something..."
5,no. one pick right now !!!,this album is a must. probably the best rap album in 2006. santana spits dopeness on the mic while he got hands on some of the dopest productions over the past few years. don't sleep on this one !
3,Not the best from juelz...but still pretty good,I've heard juelz on mixtapes and know what he can do and this isn't his best work. If there was about 2 more good songs on this cd it would of recieved a 4. His flow isn't smooth and sometimes i think this cd relies on the beats to bring some of the songs up.
5,One word to describe this. . .Spectaclular YES!!,"This is exactly what i have been waiting for. The beats are very good. I couldnt ask for more. . .21 songs all worth my money. Cant wait till Cam'ron comes out with a banger, but i dont think he can top this one.GO GET THIS CD IF U HAVENT YET"
4,Solid Release from Juelz,"I thought this CD was very good. I've never really be into the Dipset crew that much, but I think Juelz might have made me a convert. The CD is upbeat, excellent production, and is an enjoyable addition to any rap lovers collection"
4,NICE CLUB CD!!! THIS ONE'S OFF DA MEAT RACK!!!,"JUELZ KNOWS HOW TO MOVE THA CROWD WITH THIS ALBUM...TRUST ME ON THIS ONE...MUST COP OR IF YOU CANT AFORD IT SEE IF YOU CAN FIND THA BOOTLEG,AS LONG AS YOU CAN SPREAD THA WORD!"
5,Back to the Basics Punk Guttermouth is Known For,"Guttermouth is one of the fastest and hardest pop-punk bands around. This album displays their amazing talent. With their last two albums, Covered in Ants and Gusto, the band took a different direction with their music and it didn't go that well. But finally, we have a Guttermouth album that the old school fans will still enjoy. Hope A.F.I. changes their pace on their next album (even though they probably won't)!"
1,Thats Enough!!,"I honestly was the biggest Guttermouth fan on earth. My most cherished high-school memory was singing a verse of ""1,2,3, SLAM!!"" with Mark onstage in Arizona. For God sakes thats enough of these guys. They should have stopped after Gorgeous. They sound and look just as ridiculous as the Beastie Boys. A bunch of drunk 50+ year old men wishing they were still 20 years old playing on Venice Beach."
5,Holiday Classic,"What can I say. I put it it up there with my other favorites, Holiday Inn and Christmas in Conneticutt. Great holiday classic. Downloaded to my kindle fire."
5,Christmas Classic,I've watched this every Christmas on TV for about 50 years and decided to finally buy it. It was only a penny for a used VHS tape
3,"Love the movie, sound was tricky","We had to keep adjusting the sound. You could hear the music at a reasonable level on the tv, say 6 - 8. When they were speaking it had to go up to 18/20/ Really weird and I think it's a qc problem which is not a good thing.....you can watch it no problem, it's an annoyance to keep adjusting volume"
5,xmas dvd,husband loves both movies and was able to replace 2 vhs tapes with one...great savings. came in condition that was stated and shipped out fast.
5,Classic Christmas Collection DVD Review,"great black friday price! arrived in plenty of time for the holidays! brand new condition, no scratches!"
5,great classic!!,"this is a great movie for the holidays. the costumes are stunning and the ""white Christmas"" song just melts the heart every time! it is a movie of a different era. one where scenes take longer to play out, the humor is simpler, and good, old fashion values are not forgotten. in the world we live in, movies are fast-paced and you are likely to miss something if you blink. this movie takes the time to develop characters and stories. it's a great movie for sitting back and relaxing while you enjoy your egg nog with the ones you love. make it a tradition!"
4,A marvellous Christmas movie for each year!,"A marvellous Christmas movie for each year and every age, from 4 to 94. Non pretentional, but also non-violent, pure and lovely."
2,"Great Classis; Poor Quality DVD, Needs to be Restored","Since my VHS copy is really old, I got this DVD as a free rental from Blockbuster to see if it is worth buying. A friend of mine has never seen it and I'm almost embarrassed to watch it with her. The video is muddy. the colors are dull. Why in the world would Paramount reissue this wonderful film with all its gloriously colorfull scenes and not restore it?I'll wait until paramount does right by it before I buy it."
5,My Favorite,This is one of my favorite movies. I asked for it for Christmas and no one got it for me so I had to get it myself. I wore out my VHS version. The product was inexpensive and came in a timely manor.
4,Christmas Classic,"Great cast, music and direction. Wouldn't be Christmas at our house without this favorite. Truly a family movie that all can enjoy. Light on plot but a big beautiful payoff at the end."
5,"White Christmas, DVD","I bought this in fear that next year they would no longer broadcast it on TV. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. Bing Crosby is at his best, notwithstanding his roll as a priest in his black and white movies.His voice was so pure and honest, and showed no signs of fading.A good holiday movie for the entire family."
5,Great quality movie,"Hands-down, one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time. People of all ages should watch this movie. It's fun, it's heart-warming, and the performances are wonderful."
4,Replacement Parts,"Grill works good, although I have had limited experience to date with a used one left behind on a boat dock. Started to do a bang up job and clean it up, thought the aluminum inserts were an inexpensive replacement, so I trashed them.BIG MISTAKE - Do not throw them away. Use oven cleaner to clean them out. Replacements are $66.00 each - top and bottom $132 total. Half the price of a new grill.Oven cleaner would have worked wonderful had I had them back to clean. So just beware of this.Chuck"
1,Falling Apart At The Seams,"Have owned this grill for a little over 3 years when the controller burned out. I went online and ordered a new controller from Charbroil ($34.95 + S/H). Upon arrival, I plugged it in and it blew my GFI ....after inspection, I realized the electric element was also burned out, causing the controller to not work. Again, back to Charbroil, where the element has been on back order for several months...and still is as of this date ($74.95 + S/H). After days of complaining by email with the customer service department, and no electric element replacement in sight, I am returning the controller for a refund and purchasing the Holland Electric Companion. This product has inherent problems that cost way to much after an already hefty purchase price."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Something New is well-meaning enough and features some fine acting and sweet moments, but at its core it's an utterly formulaic romance about two people who meet cute, fall in love, are pulled apart by circumstances, and then...well you know the rest."
4,"""Melted Ice""","This book is a warmer side to the pimp saga. The iceberg is melted away and the heart of Robert Beck is revealed. This book in some ways is stronger than his first book ""Pimp"" but falls short in other areas. I recommend first ""Pimp"" then ""The Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim""."
3,No Slim,"I am a Iceberg fan, but I just didn't like this book. It didn't catch me. I have began reading it on several occasions, but never seem to finish. I am sure that other Beck fans will enjoy this novel."
5,And the truth shall set you free,"I've read several of Parenti's other books, and I avidly absorb Chomsky, Zinn, etc. So the fact that I was thrilled to get this book for Christmas (from my Mom, who no doubt didn't look inside or she'd have been horrified by the critique of the Church) should come as no surprise. Parenti writes in a very comfortable style that is more accessible than Chomsky while retaining a very academic approach. I think this makes his work far more readable for the average person and certainly for people who are just approaching the field of progressive thought (such as my wife) and aren't ready for for the more analytical style of Chomsky. The subject matter I was quite familiar with before reading it, but it was nice to be able to reference the footnotes and have easy access to supporting documentation for my arguments with people who believe anything they see on TV. Thanks for a wonderful book, as usual, Michael!"
2,"Pretty set, but rust VERY easily!","I was so excited to get this new set of knives because I had been working with mismatched pieces for so long. After doing research, I found this to be a very good deal ($49.99). But, I am very dissapointed with the quality. I would have expected more from ""Kitchenaid"". Two of the knives were rusted when we got them. When you wash them, you must be very diligent to wipe dry ASAP or they will rust. I used to put all of my old knives in the dishwasher, with no rust at all. These can't go in the dishwasher, and yet even with careful handwashing, rust way too easy.No wonder they were so cheap!"
1,Knives rust,"KitchenAid should not have their name on this product. They are not dishwasher safe, and who wants to wash every knife by hand? In the dishwasher, they rust up the first time and just get worse. I bought these for my wife for Christmas, and they will be in the trash before Mother's Day."
2,Flimsy and Unreliable,Very unsteady legs. Won't stay lit in even the lightest wind. High heat the only one that really accomplishes anything. Better off spending a little more $$ and getting one that's more dependable.
1,Absolute crap!!!,Will not light. I am not a beginner at assembly of these mini grills...all I smell is propane accumulating. Absolutely will not ignite with a brand new wand lighter. Dangerous and very poor design! Do not buy this.
3,"Eh, it's okay","The feet broke off within the first year and got bent, and the case is a bit rusted and dented, but it does the job at cooking."
4,Best camping grill for the price!,"We do a lot of ""camping"" at stock car racing events, and for years have used a worn-out cast iron hibachi to grill the burgers and dogs. While burning charcoal on the old hibachi always succeeded in getting us fed, it was long overdue for replacement.We decided to upgrade to a portable gas grill, and this is the model we bought. It has truly been night and day from the hibachi!Just the fact that it has a lid was a huge improvement! And what a concept to not have to wait for the coals to burn down, only to fight to keep the fire consistent. The grilltop is not only larger than the hibachi's, but much more stable than the 2 ""paddle"" style tops the hibachi used.Overall, I am very pleased that we replaced the hibachi with this grill - for the price, it can't be beat as a portable grill!"
4,Portable fire is a great thing!,"I received this grill in the mail...promptly. Although it was a little flimsier than I'd like, it is still a great grill. The ease of setup and the cooking ability that you get are worth WAY more than the price. NO MORE LAVA ROCKS!!!Do yourself a favor...buy either this one or the Weber portable. But look at it this way, for the price of the Weber, you could buy TWO of these!!!"
1,Propane Grill,"We received the propane grill very fast but we a little disappointed how thin and cheap looking the grill was. The plastic screw in handles are not very elegant and the screws do not hold the handles tightly to the grill metal. We will make it do for now but frankly it is a very ""cheap"" looking and functioning product for the money. We would not ever buy this again."
4,Murder of a Dead Man,John is indeed a true writer of mystery and intrigue. Wonderful read; wonderful plot; wonderful characters. You won't want to miss this read.
3,Good for Beginners but advanced users won't find much here..,"As an advanced programmer I found the book interesting but lacking much useful source code or information not already available. Sections discussing what an exception is, or how to use the debugger are examples of information that just wasn't helpful to someone who's experienced with these. Given the advanced IDE's available, I found the chapter on using MS Word as a java editor without much value.If someone is new to java this might be a good book for them but not for an experienced programmer."
3,Great But Dated,"I agree with the other reviewer. I was setting up some printouts for an upcoming birthday party and things were going great until I noticed that the cost comparisons only go to 2003. So I did a Google search on the software and found that an update for 2006 is available, but for $24.95. Now I have to decide if the upcoming event warrants the purchase of yet another piece of software that will become dated within the year."
4,Good Edition of C&C,"If you don't have a computer, this is the Command and Conquer game for you. While there are no new innovations to the classic CGI vs Nod stooryline and gameplay, the graphics and sound have been improved tremendously. The explosions and flames are particularly striking even without an expansion pack. The game has a great difficulty curve, earlier missions being easier than later ones. Conversion from mouse control to the N64 control is impressive. I found it easier to control than the actual keyboard/mouse combinations of the PC versions. Overall, Veteran C&C players won't find anything new here, but for those new to it, the game proves to be quite a find."
2,they should have left it just a computer game,I was not impressed by the nintendo64's interpritation of this great computer game. I thought that this game was not only a wast of my money but a wast of my time.
3,okay but room for improovement,"Product is okay but I would like it to be a bit more sensitive to light. It turns on too early. The amount of light in the room is fine for my use. I need it to illuminate the floor so my kids can find their way to the toilet ect. during the night time. I had it set to low and that was more than enough for me. I would imagine that the bigger ones (more LED's inside) will create too much light. Good product, works for me!!"
2,not what i expected,"I chose to buy these night lights over others because one reviewer stated that the night light started off dim when room begins to get dark and gets brighter as the room gets darker. This is not the case. The night light is either on or off. There is no gradual brightening as the room gets darker. If that is what you are looking for, don't get these. Aside from that disappointment, they are fine."
4,Just what I was looking for,A great little night-lite. I wanted a light to put in a back room; something not too bright. This 2-LED light is just right. Walking from the front of the house to the back at night is easy now that I can see where I'm going. The two-pack is perfect because I can take one on trips to use in unfamiliar hotel rooms.
5,School book,"Book required for my class, ordered it, was delivered the day classes started, I'm a happy man"
1,Dislike Book,"I'm not a fan of this book. It intends to provide examples, but doesn't elaborate. Examples are vague and unclear. For grad students who are not majoring in HR, it's difficult to comprehend."
1,A most unfortunate undertaking: 'projection-prayer'?,"This book is a most unfortunate undertaking, unless you like:'projection-praying' & visualization techniques a la New Ageusing human imagination vs. divine mediation in prayerconversing more than communingreceiving from God more than giving (Jesus said, It is more blessed to give than receive!)mysticism over modest humility before the Mystery of His Presenceworldly approach rather than heavenly perspectiveLight-years better books to bless your prayer life includePrayer of Jesus by Hank Hanegraaff, Prayer Matrix by David Jeremiah, or just reading the Psalms which are inspired prayers.This book is a poor substitute for using the Bible's own prayers by Jesus, Moses, Daniel, David, Paul and praying Scripture back to the Lord to please Him most.Book most definitely NOT recommended."
3,An average story.,"As a Northwesterner, I was interested in reading this book because of its setting. The descriptions of Washington State (my home state) were done pretty well, but the dialogue between the unrealistic characters was less than satisfactory. Malamud chose to ramble on, sometimes in two page segments, in inneffective attempts at a sort of social statement. The ending of this book was absolutely ridiculous."
2,"Too many pages, so little subject.","It seems that the authors put things in this book only to make the book thicker. There are chapters like: How to use the help system, Controlling Windows, Using IntelliMouse, that are nothing but useless. The authors claim that with this book you can automate your mosto common task with macros, but there's nothing about this subject in this book. Unless you know nothing about Windows and Excel, buy another book."
3,Zoo Tycoon 2 Endangered Species.,"The game is fun, the scenarios run very well but, the freeform and challenge games run horribly choppy. There is major graphics trouble. I admit it is a bit of a dissapointment. The game eats up all the processes by trying to load and overly extensive background."
4,Wasn't sure what I'd think...think very good read.,"This being my first Mel Odom book, I was not sure what I'd think of the writer. This is not my usual genre of choice to read either, but I really liked it and hated to put it down. Can not wait for number two- due out in a month (April - I believe). Want to know what happens to the characters in the book series. Happy reading."
2,Lame,"I really hate when a writer true to write a military based book with little to no research, he couldn't even get the ranks right."
2,"Decent story, cardboard characters","While I found the plot entertaining, the characters were undeveloped, cardboard. The random religious references seemed contrived and out of place."
3,"Fast pace read, but...",This is a fast-pace book and it becomes interesting very quickly/I was somewhat disappointed in the quick ending.Another downer were to constant bible references and religious quotes. By the end of the book i was tired of them
5,Great Movie,"I saw this movie when it first came out. What stuck in my head the most at the time and all these years since is the music. Before this bought this movie I had only seen it once since, it was never a movie that was made for those endless repeats on the movie channels.Being a foreign film, most don't do well in the USA. It isn't a Hollywood production so it isn't a ""cookie cutter"" movie. If you like good foreign film, music that is more than the crap you find on the Top 40 lists today then you would like this movie. One major tip before you decide to buy, do a search on YouTube for the movie title, you can find some of the music and scenes from the movie to give you an clue if you would like it or not."
2,Not very complete. Too many ActiveX controls missing.,Don't believe the book's cover. The reference is not even a quarter complete. Many ActiveX controls are missing. Where are the references for the database? Why include Usercontrol references in the book when even the Winsock control is not covered? The source code examples in the CD are next to useless. Why call this book the #1 Definitive Master reference???? I want my money back.
3,Hit and a few misses,When Barry is on -he is hysterical and some of the columns in this collection clearly demonstrate that. However there are a few clunkers mixed in. By and large I enjoyed it but found it a hit and miss experience.
4,De best of Yesteryear,"This is a collection of some of the raw kaiso talent from Trinidad and Tobago. Powerhouses such as Black Prince, Zandolee, and Blakie perform."
4,Increases visibility at night.,"This material is hiighly reflective and increases my Honda 750 ACE's visibility at night. However, if this is placed at an angle other than 90 degrees to the viewer the visibility is diminished a great deal. There is enough material to highlight more than one bike. You need a utility knife to cut this material, but it is easy to work with and comes with good instructions. Would have given a 5 rating if reflectivity was greater at a viewing angle of less than perpendicular. I think this is a good deal and would purchase again for safety's sake. Shipping was very fast and all was as described."
3,"Not bad, but 3m should do better.",Its a gun metal black in the day but remember saves you butt at night. The Two things i didnt like. ONE :they could do alot better is give more for the bottom half of the saddle bags(NOT ENOUGH). TWO: The 3m sticky tape sticks like a .25 cent sticker you get for your kid. Its a shame to have 3m's logo on it. On the upper half of my bag Im assuming on the first cold day when i open my bag it will pop off. The 3m will NEVER stick to a coat like on the picture. But all and all people can see me at night ... if they dont pop off.
3,Few Redeeming Qualities,"You remember those books we were assigned to read in school... Almost falling asleep as you reread the same tired line 3 times before you realized you had been doing so. Well this book is not entirely like that, but it does come close. I came away feeling like I was told to read this book instead of picking it up because I choose to.While reading I came across some line about a shop owner having a priceless gem, and I realized I had better things to do with my life like check gemm.com to see if I could get my hands on a LP I've been wanting. At least this book did one good thing, when I went looking for that LP I found an awesome deal at GEMM.It's all about that silver lining my friends...The bottom line: the reading at times seemed laborious but it does help you solidify your own understanding of why you started collecting in the first place."
3,Which Arturo Toscanini are we talking about?,"In an excerpt from this book posted on amazon, the statement is made that one Arturo Toscanini set the record industry back, in the 1920s, by refusing to allow his voice to be recorded. The Arturo Toscanini that most music lovers remember was conducting La Scala and the New York Philharmonic around that time. We don't think he was singing. Can the author address this? Perhaps I read the excerpt wrong. In this case, we're not talking about an obscure historical figure."
3,Dont be fooled,"I must say this is a good game, but before i got it i looked at the screenshots and i thought wow these are the best GFX ever for an AoE game, however, all the hype was fake when i realised the graphics werent as good as the screenshots. Dont get me wrong, this is a very cool game, but if your new to the RTS series i reccomend Empire Earth (not the 2nd empire earth!) or Age of empires 2."
2,Too much movie.,"Having played Age of Mythology (Titans Expansion) I was expecting more dynamic interaction. This has more movie time between action chapters that slow down the play, and reduce the openness of play. You are locked into very specific actions and not many opportunities to be creative."
4,Almost Perfect,Awesome graphics and cool to play. Only thing is some of the old options are missed in this version!
2,Down and dirty...,First off I'm an RTS/Strategy junky. You can keep your first person shooters and sports games as long as you leave me the RTS's. Unfortunately this one stinks. It's a complete step backwards in playability and fun. It does go forward in the graphics department but in the end that doesn't make up for a bad game. The thing that gets under my skin is that they shrunk the game. It seems like you are only able to control half the units compared to AOE 3. It reminds me of Warcraft and how Warcraft 3 just completely messed up that series. I guess I'll just hold me breath and wait for Supreme Commander.....
3,"Okay, so it plays","If you like AoE then this is another like the others. I do get tired of the scots accent. My first set of discs were bad and Microsoft replaced them quickly, with a minimum of hassle. That part was pretty cool.The game seems to have a little issue syncing up with Vista, which is funny given its heritage."
2,Age of Flop,"A dissapointing letdown. Ensemble spent almost a year building up a huge hype, excitment. Finally when the much awaited sequel was released...it felt like a blow to the knees with a baseball bat (not to mention wallet). Don't spend $50.00 on this mediocre game. Being a fan of the Age of Empires series, and having all three including Age of Mythology this will be my final purchase for the Age series. I won't even consider the next series if one does come out. On the positive side, yes the graphics are visually stunning and the concept of 'home cities' makes for interesting game play. Other than that the game offers little else. As well the graphics are not anywhere as near the quality advertised with their screenshots. I have a 3.5 Ghz Intel, 1Gig of DDRAM, and a costly 256Mg DDR Nvidia Video card all with XP Pro, and the game still plays like a huge dissapointment..... Adios Ensemble."
4,a classic,This is by far the best movie ever about a college tennis team. I only wish they would include some extras like directors commentary.
4,It would have gotten 5 stars but for one reason . . .,"I love my Patio Caddie gas grill, I've had it for 4 years. I needed a part for it this year and was forced to buy the part through Char-Broil, at a rather high price. Standard replacement parts do not fit this grill. The part took 16 days to get to me. That's alot of NO GRILLING in June.I still love my grill but am keeping my fingers crossed that nothing breaks down. So far only one part in 4 years isn't bad.The size of the grill rocks !!!"
4,Great BBQ for Condo or Apartment,So far i love this bbq. Gives you the same hieght as full size bbq but in half the size.
2,Ok,"I had purchased the patio caddie 3 years ago and loved it. I would bbq about 4x a week, it was that great and convenient.Unfortunately I needed to replace the bbq, and ordered another one.The new model is much less quality. And I paid $60 more on Amazon than I did the first one. The control know does not regulate the heat to HIGH, heats up the grill to MEDIUM at best.Also having spanish translation on all the controls is annoying.It is a great fit for a small patio, and the previous one was GREAT!!! I was hoping for the same quality and enjoyment, but have been extremly disappointed."
4,"Great grill, need a new gas tank...","I LOVE this grill! Although it is limited in size and you can't adjust the grill height as with larger gas grills, it is perfect for one or two people. I have always been a charcoal fan, but I have to say it's nice to come home and grill up some chicken or fish for one, without waiting for coals!Does anyone know where I can get a replacement gas tank in the small size that comes with the grill? I recently moved from CA to MA and the movers wouldn't take even an empty tank...I can't find that size in the NorthEast...hey Amazon, do you sell just the replacement tank?"
5,Affordable Patio Grill That Works!!,"I recently bought this grill after evaluating my barbeque needs and my space constraints. First of all this is the only propane grill that has a circular shape as opposed to the much bigger and bulkier rectangular grills. As a result, this grill tucks neatly into my porch and looks very slick. The grill, although small has more than ample grilling space for grilling for 2-4 people. As a suggestion, make sure you keep the lid closed to generate enough heat to cook meat properly. My last suggestion is to purchase a full capacity tank (cost approx. $20) and use the one provided as a backup."
2,Damaged in Shipping,"Everything was fine with the grill except the lid had a quarter-sized piece of enamel missing during shipping. Charbroil said they would not replace the lid because it didn't affect the grilling. I sent them a photo indicating the damage to the lid and they decided it would be covered under warranty. It's been two weeks and I have not received the new lid. I called Charbroil and am getting the runaround...hopefully the cover will be shipped soon. Otherwise, it's a very nice looking grill for a small patio."
1,not for me,"Perhaps some folks don't mind un-even low heat grilling but for me, I'll move on. The fire is far too un-even and too far from the grill plate. So if you like your steaks cooked quickly, crispy on the outside, rare on the inside, skip this grill.I will try the weber Q next."
5,Char-Broil Patio Cadie,"Love the ease of operation, low fire hazard, cooks equal to or better than gas grills, no gas smell."
1,TERRIBLE,My grill stopped working after two summers and it had WAY too many hot and cold spots. I bought it in 2009 and now have to buy another grill this summer. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
4,Grill,Works well. Upon delivery 2 essential parts were missing. It took an additional 10 days to receive them. This was irritating.
4,patio perfect,"This has been a great grill for just the two of us. It also fits in our small patio. We can grill for up to six steaks at one time, so it is great for small parties also. Love it."
5,The best propane grill for small areas,"I've owned the Char-Broil Patio Caddie for quite a few years and I am currently on my 2nd grill. For those looking for a compact grill to use on a small patio or balcony, I believe that this is the best grill that you'll find.I'm not sure if the other reviews mention this or not, but this grill does accept a full-size propane cannister, so you can just swap it out at your local drug or hardware store when it's empty. My grill did come with the smaller cannister, but I bought it quite awhile ago, so perhaps they no longer do. If yours doesn't, it's no great loss, in my view, because once again, I've never used the smaller cannister. Just get yourself a full-sized one and it will last a lot longer.The temperature gauge seems very accurate and the grill is quite durable. I figure that this grill should last you about 5-6 years, with regular use. I'd definitely recommend it and I'd also suggest buying the cover to keep it looking nice on the outside as well."
5,Excellent for smaller familes,"This is the second one of these grills that we have owned. It's an excellent choice for families with two to four people, and familes with a small deck. Our first one rusted out after sitting outside in New England weather for over five years. We would definitely buy this grill again."
4,Patio Caddie Gas Grill,"Great grille for condo or apartment dwellers that are limited on outdoor space. It cooks just like a big grill, without the bulk. The smaller than standard gas tank is a bit of a problem, as you have to find a place that fills them. None of the more common locations that trade out the tank will take this small size. I'll probably end up replacing it with a standard size (larger) tank."
4,I love the patio caddie!,"I am a charcoal griller by nature. But, I can't use my Weber right now, so I saw the patio caddie and got one to get me through the summer. I love it! I don't like gas grills because I feel that they don't get the right heat, and it's hard to control, and this one is like that. But, that being said, to grill a steak or fish or veggies, this is great. The small footprint is super, it wasn't too bad to assemble, and it's so convenient to use. I will always recommend a ""real"" grill over a gas grill, but for a gas grill, I love this one."
3,Great little grill,"Purchased this grill late last fall and have used it several times. Chose it primarily because of its space-saving aspect (I have a small porch), but have been equally as impressed with its functionality. It cooks much better and more evenly than my old full-size grill. Unless you regularly cook for a large family or big crowd, this grill is plenty big enough. And it doesn't take up half your porch!UPDATE: Like so many of these grills, of course the igniter promptly died after a year's use. Still a great size and cooks well, but disappointed that they still can't make a gas grill igniter that stays working for the life of the grill!"
2,Not Travel -- Social Activism!,"I get the ""Best American"" series to stay current with what some of our best writers are saying, but this year's editor has led me down the garden path.At least 50% of the articles dwell on environmental or social causes. Yes, I suppose the writers had to travel somewhere to get their data, but their essays are not about travel; rather, they are about causes.I will hope that, for 2004, the series publishers get a handle on things and place social essays in the ""Best American Essays..."" collection and reserve the Travel volume for just that."
4,Custer's Handicap,"This book has many details never before revealed about the life of a cavalryman of the 19th century including their diet, clothing, equipment,tack, routines and personal observations at the time. Custer's group was a rag-tag bunch, worn out uniforms, green riders, out of shape horses, poor shots and several were intoxicated in order to calm their nerves. The first time Pvt. Taylor fired a pistol while mounted on a horse was during Reno's retreat."
2,WIll not fit Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard,"Most people I know use a keyboard like Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard, or some other large keyboard. The pad that holds the keyboard will not fit this kind of keyboards, the large keyboard will have to rest on the wrist cushion.Also the mouse try will not accommodate standard a mouse pad easily."
5,great for the professional desks,Sturdy and reliable this tray affixes to only the strongest professional desk tables.I've had it for over a year now with no problems or complains. Installation was not hard.
2,Poorly written,It was over priced and poorly written.The plot was underdeveloped and the characters were predictable.The historical language was forced and awkward.The dialog and characters thoughts were constantly repeated.
1,very expensive,Unbleached flour should be no more then $0.50 per pound.Walmart sells gold medal brand for 2.38 per 5 pound bag.
1,"This is a reference guide, not XML in plain English","You would think a book entitled ""...in Plain English"" would be about explaining a complicated subject in easily understandable terms. However, this book only gives a brief and very lame introduction to XML. Almost the entire book is a reference guide to the XML and XML related syntax. Since this information can be obtained over the Internet for free it is questionable why this book even exists (maybe that's why they didn't name it more appropriately ""Another XML Reference Guide"")."
2,Plain English?,"I'm almost certain I speak both English and technical English. I definitely speak HTML and I can parse XML.So why is it that I stopped and re-read two full pages trying to determine what they were trying to say? And came away knowing merely that I had been correct on my first pass; no actual useful definition of the terms was given in those pages.Also, Plain English structure puts the Tutorial first rather than last..."
5,Poetry for Young People,"Robert Frost is ""Mr. New England."" A wonderful book of poetry for the first time listener.It is so important to introduce all the wonderful literature to our young minds and an early start is extremely important.Instilling an early love of literature is a much needed element in a child's development."
5,Must have for stage managers,"I found this book very, very helpful and informative. I purchased this book when I was stage managing my first musical (community theatre) and read through it again before the last show I did. I have only stage managed three shows so far, but thanks to what I learned in this book I received a great compliment - Thanks for your work, you were so professional, I look forward to working with you again. This is a must have for a stage manager. I feel that as I progress and do more (including hopefully professional jobs someday) I can continue to refer to this book and hone my skills."
5,Become a better version of You,"This video was one of the first steps I took on my path to becoming a better me. At first it was 20 minutes where can I fit that into my day? Now, it is 20 minutes and then the rest of my day can take place. This video helped me realize what a difference simple stretches and breathing can make in my life. I am more alert to my surroundings and notice the simple things in life that I had taken for granted for so long. I no longer feel my carpal tunnel pain, and have a better perspective on what is truly improtant in life. My chronic neck and shoulder pain have all but disappeared."
1,2010 Char-Broil Bust!!!,"Had this grill for three years. It worked great until summer 2009. Thermostat burned and melted where it connects to broiler element. Char-broil customer service gladly sold me a new one - total with shipping $60.00. First time I plugged it in - which was 2 months after I received it - it melted and burned just like the first. Char-broil customer service wanted to sell me another since their parts only have a 30 day warranty. As a one time good deal customer service sent me a replacement with free return shipping of the newly burned out controller. This replacement of the replacement burned and melted just as the other two had done. However, now Char-broil won't return phone calls and ignores my emails. No response to three emails and three phone calls. Don't buy this Char-broil electric grill. It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap. Find a different brand. I am going to Weber grills."
2,"Electric is nice, but some major problems","I've had two of these grills. The first I replaced because it was starting to rust (despite being covered) -- I had no major problems with that one, the second I've only had for six months. The second grill has melted around the heating element, which seems to be a fire hazard. I was quite suprised.In addition, the thermostats on these grills have gotten worse than with the original model -- it seems at least 100 degrees off. The fire safety, not including the briquettes and a jacked up price should probably make one look for other options, if only there were other quality options."
1,Quality on a Downhill Slide,"Get something else! I bought this to replace a Patio Caddie Electric that had served faithfully for 10 years. The new one is junk. The aluminum liner for the lid doesn't fit, the tabs that hold the lid centered keep coming loose so the lid gets hung up when trying to lift it, the coating is already flaking off the grill so I'm reusing my old one, and the paint on the grill looks like it was applied with a mop. I'm ready to strip this one for parts and rebuild my old one."
1,Used to be Great - Now - Chinese Junk !,"Bought this at Home Depot, assembled, turned on, then brought it back. Took 20 minutes to get to 425 degrees - will not sear anything. I previously have owned electric charbroil patio caddies. They were originally fantastic and would get very, very hot - great for searing steaks or fish and also perfect for low, slow smoking a brisket or medium-roasting a whole chicken. Then, charbroil went for the ""gold"" and started getting the product made in China - downgrading everything - including the most important heating element. That is when the ""wheels came off the wagon"". I would go into all the problems, but I won't - it was complete, pathetic junk."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"The grill is nice and certainly serves the purpose since I cannot have a gas grill on my lanai. One problem with assembly - namely the insulation basket for the top is too small to fit as it should. Other than that the grill is easy to assemble.Main gripe is grill will not get over 400 degrees F. Left it on for a long time and the hottest it will go is about 420, which drops when food is put on. Not the best temp. for searing or real grilling.UPDATEIt gets worse - after 5 or so uses the grill now only gets to 300 F, by next week I won't be able to boil water. BTW, the grill sits on a 4th floor deck, West facing, in Florida, and is used in the evening when the deck is HOT and pounded by the sun - still will not heat up to over 300 now."
1,"The grill broke in 75 days, after using it about 20 times","I didn't mind that it was a bother to assemble and that the parts didn't quite fit properly. The fact that the lid needed to be lifted off and hand no hinges was a minor annoyance. But when the plastic parts on the dial started to melt and the grill began to malfunction, I was impelled to write this bad review. A product should be suitable for the purpose for which it was intended --- grilling food --- and it should function for a reasonable amount of time considering the cost. I have a 35 year old electric grill at our camp that cost less than $40 when new that is still working brilliantly. This grill failed in 75 days! The quality of this grill is simply unacceptable. I strongly urge readers to pick a different electric grill."
2,not for large families,"I used this grill three times. The third time it started on fire. Thankfully I knew to just put the cover on and shut it off and let it burn itself off or I could have burned my face off! Part of the reason is I have a large family so the aluminum foil like pan lining the bottom of the grill had some gunk on it. I knew it had to be cleaned, but I thought I'd get three meals out of the grill before having to dismantle it and clean it. I bucked the system and bought another gas grill instead. In my condo complex we are not supposed to have gas grills on the deck, so I'll have to move it. Ironic because in all the YEARS of cooking on gas grills, the food has never caught fire like in the charbroil grill. I think it would be a good grill for a smaller family with someone who doesn't mind taking it apart and cleaning the aluminum foil like bowl like liner on the bottom of the unit. But a few of these to keep on hand because you will need them. They are flimsy. Good luck!"
3,3-1/2 stars is closer,"I've had this grille a number of years. You need to replace or clean the upper and lower aluminum liners. They can get greasy if you grille meat that isn't lean. If you try to do a high heat cleaning you can have a fire (I did). I found that if you cut slits in them where they go around the attachment areas, you can slide them out and clean them by hand. A big savings.Having a cover that you need to completely remove, rather than tilt back, can be inconvenient. When hands are full that cover can be a pain. Other than that, it cooks a good steak, shrimp, veggies...just about anything. You need to make sure that the thermostat probe under the lid is clean or you won't get the proper reading outside."
5,the best grill that i own,I own three bbq grills .A propane grillcharcol grill and the electric patio caddie.The patio caddie which I use on my deck has forced the other two grills into storage.The electric grill heats up to about 700 degrees in 15 to 20 minutes and cooks burgers in 10 minutes franks in 8 minutes and chicken in about 18 minutes.It is easy to assemble and use.It is by far the best piece of hardware that I have ever bbq'ed on.ps. I intend to use this grill throughout the winter for tailgate parties at home.
2,Plug it in,"I was very excited to purchase this grill, thinking that it would be perfect for my small patio. Alas, the instructions say that you have to plug it into an OUTDOOR outlet, and it should not be plugged into an indoor circuit.How many apartment complexes bother to put outdoor plugs on their patios? That certainly makes the grill a lot less useful."
5,"Patio Caddie is the ""Berries""","Over the years my family and I have owned 4 or 5 Char-Broil Patio Caddie charcoal and electric grills. They are easily assembled with clear step-by-step instructions written in good, clear English. I should know, because I have assembled all of them for us and for my daughter. The grill is a quality product and the warranty is excellent. Char-Broil does what they promise.Unfortunately, the style I am reviewing isn't being manufactured any longer. There's a new model out which I am sure is just as great as the one being discontinued. When our's isn't servicible any longer, we'll certainly purchase the new model."
1,Est. Ship Dates are very Questionable,"How can one write a review for something that we have not received nor do we have a new ship date. We have been waiting for this grill for almost 3 months. Plus, we cannot find a way on Amazon to contact a human body to get more information on our order. PLEASE HELP111"
2,Problems with cooking element,I have purchased 3 of these grills. The first one we had was excellent. It was heavy duty and cooked very well with no problems in the components.The second one we purchased works very well but is not as sturdy as the first one.The third one was a lemon. The exterior was not very sturdy. I've had this grill about 2 years and have had to replace the cooking element two times. Have been very dissapointed in this last grill purchase.
4,old faithful,I don't know why these disappeared from the stores. They're much better than a loofah. A little expensive though! But they work great.
2,crimdog,"When I received this item, I was surprised to find it had been dropped and had a nickel sized hole in it and also a large crack. The item was advertised as refurbished, but had no paperwork, instructions or guarantee enclosed. While it appears that it works fine, I feel the seller misled me by selling it as refurbished instead of damaged; also reported that it had a factory guarantee but no proof of the fact."
1,"This is for the old, discontinued exams","Disclaimer - I have not read these books. However, according to Microsoft's web page, the exams listed in the ""Buying Info"" section for this guide are the old NT4 exams, not the current MCSE Windows 2000 exams which are all in the 70-2XX range. I recommend not getting this book if you are looking for the exams you can take now, since the old ones are probably discontinued. The price is too low to be a real set of guides for the current exams."
4,Reading ON FIRE not a waste of time,"ON FIRE is not a book about firefighting; it is a book about a man's life who also happens to be a firefighter. Brown is a regular guy who worked hard to become a writer, not because he didn't want to be a firefighter, but because he thought he could do something else to contribute to others, doing work as a writer.I think the book is very good. I do not think the book is great. I think the book is worth reading, but I also think if you want to learn more about firefighting there are probably better books out there. Still, I think the book was not a waste of time, as some other reviewers thought it was."
5,A Fun Read,"I got interested in this book due to the upcoming movie release; looked up the title on the internet and discovered the book. Reviews of the book sounded interesting, so I bought it - I like books! My wife and I took turns reading chapters to each other while relaxing on the couch eating popcorn. The style, language and feel all have that marvelous time period flavor. None of the trailers for the movie have any resemblence to the book. The movie is not set in the same time period of nor is Mr Popper the same character as in the book. Get the book for the fun of it on it's own and don't expect any movie connection other than the name and broad concept."
4,Good children's book,"This book is a classic. It is recommended reading for 3rd graders in the state of GA. I'm not sure if my students will be able to read it independently, but they will enjoy me reading it to them."
4,Fun for all ages!,"What a delightful story! I really enjoyed the penguins antics and the Popper family. It was terrific fun to read this to the children.Of course, my teen and I enjoyed it much more than the littler ones... But it was fun nonetheless."
2,who is this book for?,"I don't know what these other people are reading, but it sure isn't this book. The wording in this book contains a lot of mistakes and if you don't have intermediate skills in the program, you will have a hard time understanding it. Secondly, some of the examples are very cheezy. I was expecting some really cool stuff, but that's not what I found. They're just intermediate how to's that don't impress me. Maybe I was looking for something different and bought the wrong book. I only bought this book because of the other reviews. Shouldn't have trusted them. Finally, the disc in my book is missing the entire chapter 3 samples. I can't do any of the tutorials. Someone needs to teach these people more coherent writing skills."
4,good book,I haven't finished the whole book...but it is well written. The CD in this book actually works...unlike a lot of other books with CDs that I have purchased.
1,I tried to like it. I really did!,"My roommate is obsessed with this guy, so I decided that I would give him a listen. I tried to find what was appealing. I've listened to it numerous times. Sometimes it takes a few listens to get to like some artists for me, but it never came with Kweller.First of all, Kweller can't sing at all. He can't hold a note, and when he tries to change notes, it's the most sour and displeasing noise. It literally made me cringe!Second, the music itself is nothing special. It's all been done so many times before. It's just a rehash of generic pop/punk/emo. (I'm not bashing punk and emo. I like a bit of it.)Last, the lyrics are ridiculous!! I found myself blurting out laughter that seemed to insult my roommate. I just couldn't hold it back. It's that ridiculous.My recommendation: don't get this unless you have bought every other album on earth and are in desperation for one more."
1,This CD Sucks,"This is probably the worst CD I have ever owned, well I don't own it anymore. (thank god for record exchange). Sure, he's young and he has a full career ahead of him. He does have a talent but the music itself is just flat out dumb. Everything about this album was just annoying especially the cover. I hated it, and everyone who owns this album and can actually sit through it from start to finish has got some issues. It reminds me of the Partridge Family breaking up, going seperate ways and each of them releasing solo albums. Wait I think that already happened."
4,GREAT CD--MISSING THE SPIRIT OF THE DEMOS,"I downloaded a lot of ben's music before buying the cd--i had heard so much about him, and i really love the demos, and i bought the cd and was a little disappointed...lizzy, in other words, commerce TX, how it should be, and wasted and ready all have much better demo versions....its still a great cd--i just really love the demos...buy the cd, but download the other versions, too.."
5,Wonderful Book,"I took a University class were The Story of Judaism, third,augmented edtion, by Bernard J. Bamberger was used as the textbook. The book was well orginized, enjoyable to read, and very comprehensive. It added a large amount of historical facts to my religous knowledge. It was well recieved by both the Jewish and non-Jewish students."
5,A worthy sequel to a classic,"The Institute is a classic of modern SM erotica, but sequels tend not be as good (just look at the Story of O for example). Well, it has to be said that this doesn't quite match the perversity of the first book. The main characters are still there: Mistress Shirer (the black dominatrix who runs the Institute) and JK her cross-dressing maid, but I missed some of the other chracters from the first book.Still, it rates very highly compared to most SM writing. I would definitely recommend the book, as I would all of Maria del Rey's book. I just hope that there's a third book soon - the Institute deserves to live on!"
1,HAIR A MESS AND ARMS FALL OFF,"My daughter was so excited to get this toy, but soon quit playing with it. The hair is impossible to comb and after a few manicures the arms fell off. The cheap plastic holding them on crumbled.The toy is worthless junk."
1,Yipes,"If you can stand really really really bad writing (""He swayed with every turn, his spine absorbing each anomoly the road's surface had to offer""), the story is okay."
5,Where to now?,I loved the union of stories and never quite knew where the author was taking me. Very imaginative story.
3,"As my rating says, ""it's Okay""","Provides lots of the background of Lent and Easter and does help others to gain an understanding of Lent. It needs to be clearer, I think, in its' description. If you want or, need ""jump off"" material it will serve your purpose."
3,Not Vincenzi's best,"I'm a Vincenzi junkie to the most part, but this one left me flat. Trite characters, ridiculous development...just didn't work for me. Had its moments, but is the first Vincenzi book I couldn't wait to finish."
3,Windfall,li have enjoyed reading most of Pennys books and will continue on my journey. This one was just not one of my favorites.
2,Not her best....,"I'm a big fan of Penny Vincenzi, especially her trilogy. But this novel is off the mark. Lots of characters but in the end the reader only cares about a few of them.Her lush descriptions of society London are all there, but the core of the plot was too diffuse and flawed."
4,Easily fits anywhere,"I liked this book. For starters, its small size means it can fit anywhere, even a pants pocket, making it readily available. However, its small size means small print, so those of you who are farsighted may be slightly annoyed.In terms of content, for such a small book it has a surprising number of word translations, and it even includes a spanish verb section. This book's small size coupled with word selection makes it a good reference tool."
4,For the one with the imagination!,"Director Tim Burton delves us into the world of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, an fantastic stop-action animation fantasy, which begins in the scary world of Halloweentown, where the infamous town resident, Jack Skellington, becomes dreary of the tiring celebration of Halloween. But he then is magically transported to a wonderful land called Christmastown and is fascinated about it! He then convinces his fellow town to celebrate Christmas, and kidnap Santa Claus! But everything doesn't go according to plan.NIGHTMARE, like any animated movie, has great songs, and also has a spooky atmosphere with scary characters from Halloweentown, including the rag-doll Sally, who is vying for Jack's affections, and Oogie-Boogie, the tormented entity.This film is rated PG because it may scare some little kids with its adult humor, but they will eat it up anyway! This film is mostly recommended to people with an imagination!"
4,Why I Ordered DVD's of old christmas movies,"I had to order ""Christmas Without Santa Claus"" and ""Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas"" from AMAZON to replace my old copies which were on VHS; while I can still view my old VHS movies on the new 48"" flatscreen (I have my VCR connected thru my surround sound home theater. The DVD versions are like watching movies for the first time. Now I can donate my VHS ones to charity 8-)-30-"
4,Nightmare Before Christmas,Tim Burton has created a masterpiece with this. Adults and children can sit and watch this together and enjoy themselves. This movie is exceptional! We've watched it many times and each time I pick up something that I missed before.
5,awesome,"this is one of my fav movies,yes i admit that this movie might be a little scary for very young kids,but its perfect for older kids and adults,the visuals are excellent and so are the characters"
3,so so,I bought this as a gift for my daughter. I realize that I bought it used but it should have stated somewhere that it had someones name written all over it. I was a bit annoyed at that. Otherwise the DVD plays fine and I guess it was a reasonable purchase.
1,"Ok movie, BAD digital copy",The digital copy has so many restrictions on the installation that it makes it less than worthless. I say less than worthless because you have to install Disney junk on your computer before you can do the ONE installation that the disc allows.Don't fall for this rip off. Get the version that has no digital copy and use a DVD ripper to make your own.
5,3d conversion is well done,"This is one of the better conversions I've seen. Watched it on a Sharp 90"" lcd and it's really fantastic. The digital copy is a bummer, some people want to watch it on full size screens and not just mobile devices, but oh well. Someday they'll 'get it'"
5,Terrific,"In my opinion this is the best stop-action film ever! The plot is unique: The denizens of Halloween Town kidnap Santa Claus and spend their Christmas by making it all a mess. The dark environment is perfectly depicted and the music is great. A Tim Burton creation. Therefore it is dark, a bit frightening and the humor is sarcastic. A perfect animated movie for all tastes!"
2,Blue Ray DVD,"I thought the DVD I was getting was one that could be EITHER regular or Blue Ray. I don't have a blue ray player so it's useless to me. But since I've already opened the package, I guess I can't return it. The gift card I used was a Christmas present from my son."
5,great movie,"I wouldn't say that this is my favorite movie, but it is a good anytime movie, no matter what time of year it is, this is another Tim Burton classic! {I like Oogie Boogie}."
5,OH MAN,"IT IS ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE IS. I LOVE IT AND IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES! I AM A VERY BIG TIM BURTON FAN AND JUST ADORE DARK-ANYTIME MOVIES LIKE THIS!!!! I THINK ALL OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES ARE ALL TIM BURTON MOVIES......I ALSO RECOMMEND BIG FISH, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, AND SLEEPY HOLLOW. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MOVIE BY MR. BURTON I DIDN'T LIKE. SERIOUSLY."
5,Classic Tim Burton,You either like his stuff or do not. My daughter liked it but some children may be scared by it.
5,Love it,I ordered this movie for my son. He loves it and watches it every night before bed. Works perfect. It is such a great movie for Halloween to Christmas.
2,nightmare before christmas,"Shipping took a little longer than expected. Dvd wouldn't play on American DVD player. Company was more than happy to refund quickly, so I would still recommend the company."
5,Mesmerizing from start to finish!,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. The story and animation are superb, and Danny Elfman's soundtrack stands on its own. We watched this over and over and know all the songs by heart and quote the best lines from the movie. Every Halloween since it came out, I started the tradition of projecting this DVD on a sheet across our garage door. Everyone loves it, kids and adults alike!"
4,Missing scenes,"I bought the special edition DVD for my husband on our anniversary. We were all excited to watch it on Halloween...as we were watching it my husband realized that they cut out some parts...the best part of ""This is Halloween"" song. My husband was disappointed b/c he loves that song and he noticed that a few lines from the song were cut. We don't know if our DVD skipped, got a bad copy or if this was actually cut from the original version."
3,I want the 3-D version on DVD,"OK...my husband and I love this movie, as well as most of Tim Burton's work. We were amazed when we saw the 3-D version in the theater. I of course will buy this set when it is released in a few weeks to go with my 1993 version I already own, but what I would really like to see is a release of the movie in 3-D format with a few pairs of glasses included (spykids). I'm sure there are plenty of fanatics out there that wouldn't mind paying the extra cost for it. I know I'd pay. I guess since it's a different kind of 3-D technology it may be harder to put into DVD format, but I will keep my fingers crossed."
5,Great gift,I bought this for a good friend who absolutely loves everything about nightmare before christmas. He loved this and I'm sure he is still loving it! makes a great gift.
4,Epic Poem of Grand Proportions,"I wondered what John Gardner was thinking when he decided to take on a project like this. The celebrated and confirmed novelist produces a sweeping epic poem about Jason, (of Jason and the argonauts) his voyages and tragic relationship with Medeia. Though after reading it I felt that it was a logical progression for Gardner come out with this. All of the deep philosophical musings that you expect from him are there, great characterizations, and really most of his prose is very poetic; some of the poetry in this work slips into and out of prose. Absolutely engaging material and often overlooked. A great read for the serious reader."
4,Create Your Own Stage Effects,"Another in the popular series of 'Create Your Own...' theatre books, Create Your Own Stage Effects is aimed primarily at the small scale or amateur level. The main theatrical effects topics are covered including lighting, sound and scenic effects, costume, fast changes, transformations, projection, make-up, properties, pyrotechnics, weather effects, fire, smoke and water, as well as historical and futuristic settings.The effects are well covered from a practical standpoint with step by step instructions and safety measures. Budget considerations also feature, with many cost-effective and ingenious methods explored, though production values and professional results are not sacrificed to achieve this.Like the other books in the series, Create Your Own Stage Effects offers a good foundation for the student or less experienced in an informal and accessible format that also lends itself well as a teaching aid. A useful and versatile book"
2,CUBA THE OLD AND NEW,"This book is not what I was looking for. I thought will it be about the history of the Cuba before Castro and the Cuba of Now. It is not this. It is a suggestion of places to visit and how to get there. Being from Cuba, this was more like advertising the places to visit for the so few and not the people of Cuba."
4,a textbook,it was shipped and arrived on time and at a great price. I little more used than I thought was described
1,"A cute story, but poorly put together.","Technically, this DVD is awful. The film transfer was poorly executed, and the subtitles are challenging even for the fastest of readers. I found myself constantly replaying bits to catch subtitles that were on the screen for literally 7 frames.From the standpoint of filmmaking in 2006, this film is awful too. It is poorly paced, edited, and photographed. And don't get me started on the audio mix.BUT...I am constantly reminded that a good story and good acting can still make a movie like this watchable.For a low-budget feature from 1985, it's ok."
2,The Two Lovers,Nice story but mediocre acting and mediocre bodies. Surely the producers could have found better looking lovers. One is too old and the other one has a hair problem.
3,"Comfortable, but not portabl","The pillow sleeps well, but filling it with 3 litres of water for a medium firmness makes it quite heavy. I'm thinking about dropping the water level to 2 litres just to lighten it and see if the pillow is still as comfortable. Overall, I have not noticed a better sleep on it than a standard foam or feather pillow. Fortunately, it costs about the same as a standard pillow so the investment isn't that great to try it out."
2,Heard it was one of the best,"I'd recently read on the EMPIRE film magazine web site that it rated Django as #2 in the best spaghetti westerns. I have to disagree with that. I wouldn't even have it in my top 20. The dubbing is outright awful, like they didn't even try to get some semblance of lip syncronization. The dialogue god-awful. Just listen to when Django is explaining to the prostitute who'd fallen in love with him why it wouldn't work. I think maybe George Lucas must have been in on the dialogue.There are some good scenes, however. The beginning where Django is on foot, pulling a coffin behind him was an image I'll long remember. Also when he guns down five bad guys in the saloon-very slick. All in all though, it just didn't work for me, and could only recommend it to someone interested in increasing their knowledge of the Italian western genre."
5,The Best WESTERN EVER! I MEAN EVER!,"Only Italians know how to make a western. This is not some Johnny Wayne crap American movie,this movie is even better then the Good,the Bad, and the Ugly Jew, with Clint Westwood :)) Do not listen to the reviews made by some American film buffs or whatever they call themselves, see this movie for yourself. Anyway only a European could appreciate a movie like Dijango!"
4,"Spaghetti Western with extra red sauce, please!","This was a great film and very bloody for it's time. Apparently it was banned from the UK for it's violence. A bit tame in our day and age but nevertheless a bloody shoot 'em up. The music in this film is great and was one of the points that really stood out. Which leads to Franco Nero who does a great job in this film as the titular character, Django. Sergio Corbucci has directed a very solid Western hitting the highs and lows of a violent era. Watch this film and you'll know exactly why Westerns are a staple in cinema."
4,quality of DVD we received here!,"We loved the movie. However, the sequel after the movie ""stuck"" so had to turn off. We have not viewed all the other movies yet. Thanks."
2,Performance not as rated.,"They do what light bulbs do; light up.They are rated for 1,500 hours. I have installed several of these bulbs in an Ikea floor lamp. They consistently break after 1-2 months. At most, I estimate these bulbs to last for no more than 350 hours. Glass goes dark, then one day they just don't light up anymore, suggesting they perhaps heat up more than they're rated for.For the price, they're not worth it. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find cheaper elsewhere, so I just bought two more. Next time, I'll probably buy a new lamp, with different kind of bulbs."
4,"The source code is still there, but relocated","To be fair, it is not a bad book to learn Word/VBA. The user level is correctly marked as ""Beginning"", so don't ask too much or criticize too harsh. To learn a new skill, one book is not enough. I like a ""simple and easy"" book like this to gain the fundamental in less than 3 days, then look for an advanced one. Besides, the source code is still on MCP's Web, but in different place (click SAMS on mcp.com, type the key words of the book title in the search box, you should find it). Lot of readers depends on other people's feedback to decide if they should buy a book, so be responsible to your ""review"". By the way, I am not the author's friend and not affiliated with MCP, SAMS, or Amazon. I am a reader who knows how difficult to find a ""right"" book, and don't like to see anybody be mislead."
2,Beginners Only,"I am a Visual Basic developer and I bought this book to expand into VBA. The book provides a decent amount of explanation of many topics, but does not go into detail about any of them. Also, the code examples are brief at best and did not help me at all. After working on a project referencing this book for a few days, I was not able to get my Word document automated. I got more help from the MSDN and the Object Browser. If you already know VB, don't bother with this book."
1,Avoid This Edition,"This is the definitive history of the Dark Ages by a truly great historian. However, this particular edition is a photocopy of a book that appeared to have been heavily damaged, and the rip-off artists who made it ignored the fact that a number of pages were missing content and are unreadable.If you are interested in the subject matter, you can buy used for less money, and you'll actually be able to read the book. Hopefully, Dover will come out with this."
3,easy listening,"Honestly, I give this album, 3.5 stars. I was kinda dissapointed with Sleepy lyrically, but he makes up for it with beats and catchy phrases. I love the live instruments, being that every song is not computer generated. I don't know, I just thought that him being around the likes of Outkast and Goodie Mob would exert some influence lyrically, but the lyrics are nothing profound. All in all, I like the album, reminds me of a pimp soundtrack, lol, easy on the ears, his vioce reminds me of Marvin Gaye on some songs. Some of my favorites are I'm Soul and Sunday Morning"
1,Get your own style dude,"C'mon man, there was only one Marvin Gaye. Be like Outkast and be original. Imitating Marvin's style aint workin'."
1,Didn't work for us,"We hung the trap 2 feet away from a large wasps nest. After 3 weeks it had caught only two. In the end, we sprayed the nest with spectracide and that fixed the problem."
3,More flies than wasps,I didn't trap any yellow jackets but I am catching lots of flies. The liquid dries up rather quickly.
2,"""Remaster"" Is Not Remastered","Is the idea here that Manuel Gottsching did the original vinyl rip released by Spalax? Because this is the same old vinyl rip, so slapping a ""Remastered by Manuel Gottsching"" sticker on the front really doesn't bode well for the integrity of those involved in this project, as it suggests that there is something new here.Look, if tapes are lost, then fine. That's life. But to use the same old vinyl rip that Spalax released and not even a fresh one after all these years? On top of that, I cannot hear a thing that is different about this version. They sound the same. If the old transfer was going to be used, I guess the decision was made that nothing much needed to be done with it.I cannot agree, as the old transfer used some denoising and a far better vinyl rip could be done with some proper declicking software now.Shame.4 stars for this album, but 2 stars for the 2011 ""remaster."""
3,Daylight time confuses watch,"When I first got this watch, the only negative was that it was heavier then expected.It synced up perfectly with the radio signal, and has been right on the mark since.However, came daylight savings time, and it has gone haywire. It did not adjust to the DSL by itself. All of my attempts to reset it manually have failed. I am puzzled as to what to do with a watch that still reads the minutes and seconds correctly but is one hour off!"
3,Love the Perfume...but buyer beware of sending or returning via UPS,I love this perfume....however I had to return the bottles I purchased as there seemed to be some tampering with them. It was ALMOST impossible to return perfume unless your are the manufacturer! I will commend the company who I returned them to...for they went above and beyond helping me get them back wihtout the hassle of going through the post office.
1,ugh!,The plot is corny and unrealistic. The characters couldn't be more transparent if they were glass. Definitely a waste of time...unless you want to get a few good laughs at the author's unintentionally humorous style.
1,Painful....,"The author has written an unrealistic ""thriller"" guaranteed to make you groan (often in pain, occasionally in laughter). ""Lust for Danger"" is filled with the kind of preachy, immature writing that one only expects from a bad B movie. Somehow, Brooks has managed to write an extremely predictable novel filled with completely unrealistic situations. The dialogue of the story is unnatural and the writing in general is like that which might be found in an exercise for a creative writing class."
5,Lust for Danger - Packed with Adventure!,It was hard to put the book down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next!
4,SENTIMENTAL - NICE,"You just have to love this movie, if for no other reason the touching father-daughter relationship, and of course, the old standby George Carlin. Others have relayed the story, actually some panned and bashed it; but I enjoyed Ben, Liv, Jason, Jennifer, and the little girl (Castro) was terrific. I thought the flick was fun, enjoyable, and a love story to be remembered. Accolades to Director Kevin Smith."
3,Jersey Girl - Mini Review,It takes a special kind of girl to know exactly what she wants... and not give up anything to get it.
5,Jersey Girl,"I first seen the movie on TV, I loved it so much I had to buy the tape. I have watched it so many times, and it still has the same magic to it as when I first watched it. The music is great, I wish there was an available soundtrack I would buy it also. You just have to see the movie to judge for yourself, if you like romantic love stories, then this one is it, as far as .....Dylan McDermott.... why else would I watch the movie a million times over!"
4,Great movie!,"I thought this was a great movie. I honestly did not expect it to be very good so I was really surprised by how much I liked it. I love Ben Affleck anyway, but I thought everyone in this movie played a great part. The little girl that played his daughter Gertie was so cute and such a good actress. This is just a fun movie. The beginning is a little sad, but the rest is upbeat."
5,Jersey Girl,"This movie is one of my favs, the quality was great, will try to make amazon my one stop movie shop!!"
3,JERSEY GIRL,"Sadly for many fans of Ben Affleck, this movie that supposed to be a great drama and portraid the irony of life, it got affected by the bad publicity made on Ben and Jlo, and the flop that Gigli became, although I still dunno if Gigli was good or bad cos I haven't seen it. This movie it's an average one, the story is balnd and without a continuos plot. Ok he became unnemployed, he work with his father and had a supposed romance with Liv's character, but every lil' aspect presented in this movie it's hard to be connected, anyway, the best things about this movie are the acting, every actor does well in that matter, but the plot just don't make any connection between one scene and another, although the best scenes are the fight between Ben's and his daughter, and the Video Store scene....great....but after all it's not a movie that I'll watch agian sorry....only if is on cable....hihihi....***THREE STARS"
4,"Different, but still very much a Kevin Smith film","I realize that some people may find this film a departure for Kevin Smith, but I still saw the same humor, the same sharp dialogue that I expect from a film by this director. I love all of Kevin's films, and I paused the movie at one point and said to my husband, ""This is a pretty fantastic comedy."" Sure it has the same family-fare moments we expect from Disney, but this film also has some pretty amazing performances from its actors and the story came off as very real to me. Also, it's funny. The moments are real and touching and undoubtedly humorous. I'm pretty picky when it comes to movies; I don't like spoof movies or over-exaggerated comedies. That's why I love Kevin's films--they make me laugh because they are so smart and biting--even when the story combines the ill-fated couple Affleck and Lopez. I say good job, and while I'm looking forward to Passion of the Clerks, I'll be happy to see Kevin go back down this path again as well."
1,Wrong Version.,"The game is probably still awesome but I'll never know because, I bought this and I received the Macintosh version, not the DOS version.Buyer beware."
4,Extra Questions for the Test!,This series contains a quick review of each exam objective and a large array of questions per objective.The questions are relatively similar to those on the test and will at least give you an idea of where you need to brush up.I would reccomend this book along with any of the Coriolis or Syngress MCSE series.
5,Music From The Yiddish Radio,"This is a wonderful companion piece for the album "" The Yiddish Radio Project"". It contains the music and performers that defined not only popular Yiddish music of the 1930's to 1950's but shows how the music was also tied in with the American Experience as you see how swing music and other American popular music influenced much of what was played on Yiddish radio. This is a winner. Ya just gotta tap you toes and snap your fingers."
4,comfortable,"thanks just what needed just the right height, I am a tall person and i received it in just a couple of days"
5,Excellent Routines,"The exercises in this book are divided into programs, and you can advance from one program to another. Each program is excellent for what it represents. You're told how long the exercises will take. Program One, for example, a Beginner program, takes about seventeen minutes. You don't need weights to do these exercises: you use your own body weight, pushing it off a desk or wall. You can do these in any room at home, or in a motel. If you want to lift weights, one of the programs is a weight-lifting one. These are excellent exercises. My book is so old that the binding is falling apart, so I've photocopied the pages I use most."
4,So unusual!,"I get compliments every time I wear this. I took a chance, because I tend to be a bit plump. As other reviewers noted, the sleeves do run snug. But otherwise it's a great jacket at a great price. The grommets are just so fun.It is fully lined. I just love this modern addition,and it's not too ""young"" feeling, just right."
1,defective,"I received a defective product. The plastic bag was leaking at the bottom. Tried to scotch tape it, but still leaking."
1,didn't work on flies at my house (near Santa Monica Airport),"I was kind of at my wits end with our fly situation. we had some kind of biting flies, they'd land on my dog's ears and bite on her until she bled. Once they got a hold they wouldn't let up. She seemed pretty miserable about it, and exhausted from flipping her head around trying to get the flies away. We ended up spraying our hands with OFF repellent and petting her head, but the flies still harassed her. I got two of these to try and abate the situation. NOT A SINGLE FLY went in the traps. I know they worked for some people, but in the event that someone else in this area has these same biting flies (in Mar Vista, mostly through June and July) these traps didn't work with them. We got some of those sticky coiled paper rolls, and that caught a few, but still had to keep applying OFF to the dog."
5,Adios Flies!,"Had never used these before but with the drought and heat, flies were everywhere. While I was putting the first one up, I dropped it. Once it is full of water and you drop it,game over! Split right open. Luckily I had ordered two. At first, didn't notice much action but after a few days, it filled up quick. Stinks to high heaven but, man, it works! DO NOT hang it close to people areas. Am now on number three but it has totally drawn the flies away from our patio. Great stuff!"
1,"Did not ""trap"" a single fly","After looking at the other reviews I decided to give this a try. The reviews I saw made it look promising. However, no such luck. This thing didn't ""trap"" a single fly. I even put it right next to our outside garbage pail which is always loaded with fly activity. They were flying all over/on the garbage, but not a single one paid any attention to this ""trap"". Total waste!"
1,"Either I've attracted Highly Evolved Flies, or this is 100% Rubbish",Are there a lot of flies near this? Yes.Have practically any flies been caught by this stupifyingly piece of useless rubbish? No.Review complete.
1,BEWARE,"This item may work, I do not really know. The smell was so awful that we could not keep it on the porch. It made our whole yard smell like dead rotten fish. Buyer beware."
2,....,I see how it is supposed to work but I did not get flies and even worse it has a really bad smell. I didnt end up using it but its a clever idea
4,Awesome but smells,"It will fill up an entire bag with flies in no time but.....I smells really bad, you need a lot of space between your house and wherever you place it"
3,Very good although....,"The product catches flies and doesn't let them get out. I didn't like the smell of the attractant. The negative thing that we noticed is that before we put this product outside the house we had less flies than after we started to use it. This attractant attracts flies from everywhere else and you end up with much more flies that you had before, and not all of them get trapped. They keep coming and coming. We bought 3 and we already used them. We won't buy more of this product because it made things worse for us."
3,fly catcher,Works in an enviroment it was designed for. It may or may not work where you want it to. Cost is reasonable and deliver is fast.
1,RESCUE! FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trap,I wouldn't waste your time or you money on this. There are some home made fly catchers that work much better and a lot less expensive. I just didn't find this to be nearly the solution I was hoping for.
5,Awesome product.,I first purchased these in upstate NY were the flies were horrendous. I tied them to a couple of trees in the yard and WOW!! They filled up so fast with flies I could not believe it; I did not know there were that many flies around my house. After about three days I had to replace it with the extra I bought and it was full in three days. Clean up is easy. All you have to do is push the yellow top down and it is sealed. They definitely work!!
5,One of my favorites,"""Free All Angels"" is only rivaled by ""Pinkerton"" and the Blue Album by Weezer as my favorite album. This album has been playing constantly on my Winamp since it was released last May in the UK where, coincidentally, the Britons picked it as one of the best of the year. In a country filled with Brittany and Eminem, the USA has been in need of a good slap in the face for the past couple of years, and Ash's return to America is just the remedy. Pick up this album...I guarantee you'll find several songs that you like the first time you listen to it(Walking Barefoot, Shining Light, Burn Baby Burn, Sometimes) and a couple of other songs (Candy, Submission, There's A Star) that will grow on you."
4,Proper Use of Chilton's Manuals,"While I can appreciate the statements in the first review, I don't think they are entirely accurate or fair. For one thing, one MUST use the correct manual for a given car. The writer was misusing the book if he/she was taking torque specs and guessing at the correct ones for a different engine. The statement that this book is not complete is also true, but one should realize that it is impossible to cover every wire and bolt in less than 200 pages. For that, as that person had suggested, I would recommend the more expensive, but also more comprehensive, manuals offered. I have used these manuals for years, and they do have their place."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","I purchased this because the picture made it look a bit classier than some of the other thermometers online, housed in what appeared to be a wood frame. It's actually a very cheap and flimsy looking plastic frame. The thermometer itself never seems to change temperature. It's consistently at about 68 degrees, no matter how warm or cool the room gets. Don't waste your $5 on this product."
3,WOW,"Only have had the aquarium set up for a day but wow!! listen to people when they say it's dirty!!! I rinsed mine for about ten fifteen minutes a bag in a big industrial collander. Twelve hours later the tank is still a little cloudy and I rinsed the crap out of mine bag by bag. Looks awesome, very real. As long as it grows plants like everyone claims this stuff is awesome. Again very realistic, looks like my pleco is stuck in a hollow log means I gotta go. Rinse it use it be happy."
3,Looks more dark brown in the picture,"Looks like a nice dark brown in the picture. Even a softer brown would have been ok, but in person looks really light and multi color. Doesn't look natural. Works great, but being that I wanted to recreate a really natural looking river bed, I'm not impressed. Does the job though."
3,so so,If you live in an apartment and only have a bathtub to rinse this you better think TWICE!!!Clay based means you are rinsing quite a large amount of clay dust down the drain and its a pain in the butt to clean the sediment off the bottom of a tub (not to mention it can't be good for the drain either). I rinsed for what seemed like forever and even then I could have done it for longer. I have been pretty excited to get this in my tank but I am so turned off from the get go that I hope that its really gonna get these plants growin' like crazy and prove it!
5,Had to buy the DVD after we wore out the tape,"OK, so this is a 90's classic. Even my grandfather started saying""Not!"". I can't really add anything else about the movie that others haven't already said so I'll just give a little about the extras. The director's commentary absolutely SUCKED! I've read that she didn't direct WW2 because she couldn't get along with Mike Myers and it comes across. I usually love the extras on DVD's but I turned this one off because it was so awful. So buy this if you love the movie and just want a good copy, but don't buy it for the extras."
4,"WAYNE'S WORLD, WAYNE'S WORLD, PARTY TIME, EXCELLENT","WAYNE & GARTH [MIKE MYERS & DANA CARVEY] HAVE A SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY ACCESS TV SHOW. WHEN THEY MOVE THE SHOW TO A NATIONAL NETWORK, PROBLEMS OCCUR WHEN A TV EXECUTIVE [ROB LOWE] TRYS TO PUT THEM OFF THE AIR AND TRYS TO STEAL WAYNE'S NEWEST GIRLFRIEND [TIA CARRERE]. BASED ON A SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE SKIT, THIS MOVIE IS VERY FUNNY AND IT'S NEVER BORING TO WATCH. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE. FOLLOWED BY A SEQUEL."
2,A bit of a disappointing bore...,"While this novel was well written, I still often found myself bored silly reading it.The tale of Tarzan, Lord Greystroke, was wonderfully told and concluded within the first two novels (""Tarzan of the Apes"" and ""The Return of Tarzan"")...but in all honesty, I really felt it should have ended there. A third novel (and I'm sure the 20 or so sequels that followed this one) was not needed at all.As mentioned in the title, I found this third novel really disappointing. I stopped reading it a couple of times because I found it so tedious and dull (which was never the case with the first two novels), and was glad it was over when I finally finished it!Honestly, the only good part about it was seeing Tarzan's determination to save his family, and the long over-due conclusion to a particular character. Other than that...I really felt it was a waste of my time.Which is a shame, because Mr. Rice Burroughs is quite a fine writer, and the first two books were fantastic."
3,Fun book but incomplete,"You won't pass the exam just by reading this book. However, it contains useful information that other books don't.There are hands-on exercises, and plenty of exam questions (20 for each chapter, and a CD with about 200 questions that comes with the book).For example, there is a chapter that shows you how to write ISAPI server extension that can dynamically change web content, that I haven't seen in other books.Overall, it is a fun book to read, and practice your skills. It follows the 70-016 objective lines, but don't expect to much depth information from it.These are the other books I used for this exam: Programming MFC (Jeff Prosise), Begginning ATL 3 by Wrox, 70-016 ExamCram"
2,"There's no commentary, I expected more.","I wanted to know more about what John has to say. But, there's no commentary, only fill in the comments yourself. I can do that with my bible. A good buy but, not what I expected."
4,Good book,This book is a good book if you already know something about working with modems and RAS. The book is targeted towards administrators of remote access systems who already have some basic skills. This book is really helpful if you are setting up or troubleshooting a RAS system. The author wisely included info about clients other than Windows such as Macintosh and Unix clients.
1,Messed up my senseo,"I have to agree with the guy who complained about consistency. I have wasted two very expensive pods so far. The first time I used a Kona pod the machine jammed and I could not open it for 24 hours,(caused a steam lock), about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo. The next time I tried a Kona pod I got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. I am not very impressed so far. I am now afraid to try again."
1,THE WORST BURLESQUE FILM WE HAD EVER SEEN AND WE SEEN MANY,"HI,WE VIEWED THIS FILM AND IT WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST BURLESQUE FILM I HAD EVER SEEN. THE QUALITY WAS VERY BAD AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BORING!!!"
2,Upgrading & Repairing PC's Linux ediiton,"Little or no new information here. Basically the same good review of hardware. I wanted SMP processor info specific to Linux, or Memory optimization info or maybe RAID card analysis for servers using Linux. But unfortunately what is here is lots of ""plug and play"" info and a pargraph or two in each chapter with newbie hints. If you own a copy at all, don't bother. The only thing Linux is the penguin on the cover. If you do not own a copy at all...it is a good hardware manual."
3,Moderately Good,"I gave this less than 5 stars simply because it has repeats from other CD's. It is still great music, especially if this is your first purchase of a Beausoleil CD, but not my favorite."
1,wtf?,"How did anyone give this five stars? Terrible movie, I want my time back. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the plot was terrible, everything was just...terrible."
4,brilliant !!!,"Just beem dumped ? this is the movie for you, bottle of wine and a quiet evening in, and you'll feel so much better after this ;-)"
3,Not for people with no sense of humour.,"I personally loved this movie. For those who say it's crude.. grow a sense of humour. It's meant to be a little crude and sometimes over-the-top. And honestly it's not a stones throw away from anything worse than you see on cable t.v. Sure the movie isn't incredibly deep, but why should it be? It's not pretending to be such. It's just a fun movie that can be enjoyed by both girls and guys. For girls it has the cute romantic story line with the happy ending and subjects/situations most of us can relate to on some level or another. For guys there's the slapstick humour, crude jokes, and last but not least... Jenny's amazing boobs. So step of your high horse, crack open a few beers or a wine cooler or two and just enjoy the damn movie without the high expectations of anything deep or inspiring... just something funny and surprisingly endearing."
3,What a waste...,"Luckily I bought this movie used, because if I'd paid full price for it, I would still be kicking myself.Jenny McCarthy (whom I usually love) was WAY over the top in this one. The tears, the wailing - it's almost unbearable. The characters aren't very believable (I'm mainly talking about Carmen Electra here). And Eddie Kaye Thomas, as adorable as he is, landing Jenny McCarthy? Puh-leez. I was bored, and couldn't even muster a giggle during this movie.I give this one two thumbs down."
1,I didn't even watch this.,"The missus watched this at the behest of a friend. She begged me to rate this poorly. So, here we are."
1,Not worth the watch,Both Carmen and Jenny could have saved this movie but instead tried to act in this movie. In doing so they made it impossible to enjoy.
4,i hear you girl,"maybe you have to have been cheated on horribly to appreciate this movie. i cant believe all the bad reviews.. i thought it was fantastic!! i did although just go thru a very similiar situation so i could totally relate.. this movie had me laughing out loud!! yes its over the top but when you walk in on your domestic partner having sex with another woman, you do want to scream like a crazy person and fist fight the air, and then hug a tree just like she did. and you do want revenge just like she did!! although they are never worth it!!! the ending was predictable, and left a little to be desired but, if you just got cheated on you need to watch this movie!! it will help you to remember that some random sexual fling is not going to do anything but make you feel worse, and if you just hold on for awhile things WILL get better =) and your white pony is just around the corner! =)"
1,Dreadfully Unfunny,"This was a movie recommended to me by a friend. I turned it off after seeing a fish imbedded in the lower orifice of one of Jenny's dates. He yells, ""Touch my bass!"" over and over. Need I say more? OK, how about the earlier scene where another of Jenny's dates throws up on her breasts? One of the worst movies of the decade."
1,Not even worth the Free price,"While trying the Prime Membership, I thought I'd watch this movie. I ususally enjoy even the silliest comedies, but this one isn't remotely funny. It's so bad, I couldn't even sit through half of it. You'd think with two comedic starlets like McCarthy and Electra, at least it would be some eye candy fun, but McCarthy looks exactly like the DVD cover for the first half of the movie, (when she isn't covered in vomit), and Electra plays an annoying ghetto wannabe.Not worth watching, not even for free."
1,Awful!,"Awful, again I say awful!!! I have never seen anything worse. if this is typical of what Amazon Prime instant video offers, Amazon should be embarrassed, and so should Jenny McCarthy."
1,HORRIBLE AND EMBARRESSING FOR JENNY MCCARTHY,"This has to be the worst stupidest movie Ive ever seen and Ive seen them all! How people are so desperate for money they will take any script is sad, I cannot believe someone thinks having your period in a supermarket and bleeding all over the aisles is funny. Save your time and money."
2,"Not all that great, but in all fairness....","I did laugh and was mildly entertained and never bored with thisone. The DVD commentary also includes some other storiesthat are also pretty funny and explain some of the pitfalls of an underfundedmovie, which explains some of the end product here, I would think.Of course, I had seen the Ebert&Roeper; review of this movie beforehandso I was not expecting much. In fact, I was curious about a movie theyfound so terrible. And ""Dirty Love"" is not all that great, it was not as badas I expected either.My wife hated...HATED...this film, so I would not call it a ""chick flick""."
2,"Bad, gothic wannabe novel...","Joan Aiken's ""Fortune Hunters"" was written in the mid-1960s. It was one of her earlier novels, and it shows. It is a step back from the previous ""Silence of Herondale"". The book centers around a convalescent magazine editor who suddenly came into money as her father was dying. She meets a number of odd characters, such as the odd neighbor; her ""friend""'s cousin, who is a world-famous artist with a dark secret; a New Zealander who is an archeologist; and a strange invalid ""child"". The heroine is taken under the artist's wing, and bad stuff starts to happen. Is someone out to get her? Secrets are revealed, some ridiculous, and we get to see a bad scene with a fight between the villain and the invalid wild child. Trust me, just skip this one."
3,Only for the novice cichlid keeper,"This book is very similar to any other Central American Cichlid book. It has mainly very common species and doesn't try to be different from any other books on the same subject. It gives very basic and sometimes questionable information. Overall, I give it a 3 out of 5. Personally, I'd look for a book with many more species including the rarer types and more infomration about tank behavior. You'll be hard pressed to find a book with both."
3,"So so, expected more from Sam Elliott","It didn't really entertain much. The acting was okay. Mostly, I felt like I had just wasted the time I spent watching,"
1,Boring film.,If you are looking for a good lesbian movie then do not pick this one. The movie covers a woman who wants to leave her husband to pursue a career in computers. Her best friend is Courtney love and she too leaves her husband. They kiss in a couple of scenes but it is like two sisters kissing. Movie drags about a woman trying to find a career. Boring....boring ....boring. I do not consider this a lesbian film!!!
2,Nothing I liked about it,This movie didn't do anything for me...Didn't care for the characters or the plot. The ending was disapointing also.
1,Poor anti-war movie,"I am trying to decide if I am going to throw this DVD away. I watched the whole movie. It was the toughest sit through since ""Mosquito Coast"" with Harrison Ford. I do not mind watching a movie that is making the case that war is bad...war is bad, even though sometimes it is necessary. However, the movie itself jumped all over the place. As another review said, the relationships were poorly built. At first the animated portions of the film were interesting in an artsy way, but they kept coming back and were over used. The battle/war itself should have been more focused upon. The Crimean War was badly fought and this could have been a much better movie if it had shown the poor quality of generalship on both sides instead of just showing the character of the British and French generals."
3,Reality Movie,"This is one of those films that tries to tell it like it was. The reality and stupidity of war. The cartoons are not really needed, but injet some of the surreal nature of being there. Photography and acting are excellent. It tries to tell it like it was, and may in fact do so.Note: I prefer the original 1930s Charge of the Light Brigade. It was escapist fantasy."
5,So Funny!,"My daughters teacher gave this book to each of the students for Christmas ... I had never heard of it before.This was the most requested Christmas book, it had to be read at least five times a night - and the whole family had reading time at once (a rarity)! We laughed so much every time it was read.Cleverly written, great illustration. This book is about everything that needs to be done before Christmas morning; how wrong things can go; and simply being together.A new holiday classic for my family!"
1,All I want for Christmas,Was unable to play in any Dvd player because it did not come in English language. I was able to play in my laptop but had to choose a language to view it in.
2,Boring,"I purchased this first series. I found it boring. Not great story telling. Ho hum stuff. I won't be buying the second season or even worse, ever watching it on TV.The writers of this series need to inject more edge of your seat excitement. However in this series it fails miserably. It just does not draw you in. The story telling is very lame and just does not grab you enough to want to watch it. I guess I got spoiled watching Blue Bloods. That series rocks."
2,Build Your Own Pentium III PC,"As with most of the ""build your own"" books on the market, this one is pretty out of date. Also, the book supplies you with very little information which would help you select which components will best meet your needs and which components work best together (ie- which motherboards, video graphics boards ...). Basically this book just explains in very breif detail how the system all works together.The most difficult thing in building your own system IMHO is deciding which components will best meet your needs and will work well together. I did not get any helpful info from this book along these lines. In fact the author does not even seem particularly knowledgeable about the subject matter in the book. I think I could have wrote a better book and I do not even consider myself a computer geek.Bottom line, I waisted my money..."
1,Since when do authors get to rank their own books?,"This book was a major disappointment, but I can only blame myself for this. I looked at the star ranking, but didn't read the reviews. I should have, because it would have helped me much better after reading the reviews. I am somewhat savy, but I was disappointed by this book because it didn't talk to me on a level of what type of product (or brands) would be best for me depending on my budget. For example, besides price, what makes the difference in components I pick? Is it speed? Will they work better? Some products that I buy might not work better if I buy the wrong companion component... this book didn't tell me that.His writing leaves much to be desired. I should have never strayed from Upgrading and Repairing PC's by Scott Mueller. I just bought ISBN 0789723034 and it's great.Who does the author think he is giving his 1-star book 5 stars?"
1,absolutely disgusting !,"The mug looks stylish and, yes, it does not leak, but has two drawbacks:1. it's hand-wash only2. the lid is very hard to cleanafter using this mug for more than a year now I was foolish enough to take a screwdriver and disassemble the lid. The space between the seal and the top of the lid was absolutely disgusting, even though I had cleaned it regularly with a brush. Since I don't want to do a major maintenance job after every morning coffee I chucked the mug and reverted back to a cheapo mug I received as a gift earlier."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased 3 of these mugs after reading the customer reviews at this site. Unfortunately, the mug lids are ineffective. The opening where the liquid is supposed to flow through (so you can drink it) is so small it's impossible to get a sip. I tried returning them and had 1 successful return transaction but now have 2 mugs which are not usable. I've tried using a screwdriver to create a larger opening and I've tried stretching it with various utensils but the lids end up the way they started: not functional.In defense of the mug, the one that works is great. I just paid $36 for 1 instead of 3, and have had the hassle of trying to fix the others without success."
1,Don't waste your money,"This cup doesn't leak. Unfortunately, you can't sip from it either (unless you have the patience to drink your beverage at the rate of 4-5 drops per minute). There is barely any difference between the open and closed positions.Unfortunately I couldn't return it since I mangled the cup by removing a large o-ring, hoping it would allow the contents to flow more freely. It did, but now there is no difference between the open and closed positions. My suggestion is not to waste your money on this product."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!!!","I think I could get more coffee from a swizel stick. When it is open, the coffee barely trickles out. It does not allow enough coffee to drink out of it. I will say that yes it is great with being spillproof, but what good is that if no coffee comes out."
2,Should have Agent 86'd this movie in the garbage,I had expected that I would like this movie because of the cast and the source material. I loved the original Get Smart and thought Steve Carrell was a perfect choice for Max. Turns out the only character I liked was Anne Hathaway as Agent 99. The rest of it was poorly written and just not enjoyable. I was glad when it was over. A real shame.
5,So funny,"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time. Reminds me of ""Rat Race"", just a laugh a minute."
2,DIGTAL COPY WILL NOT WORK,"A warning that the Digital Copy disc that comes with this Blu-Ray set will no longer work. It ""expired"" in December 2009 and can no longer be accessed. Just something that should be noted, I think, for anyone buying this Blu-Ray new today.Having purchased it for my son to watch, and wanting to put it on his iPod to do so, was very disappointed that this wasn't known prior to purchase."
4,Great Movie,"I was a kid when Get Smart was on during the 60s and thought it was a hoot at the time. The movie does an excellent job capturing the fun of the series. It is not easy to take a series of 30 minute episodes and put it into a 90 minute or so movie but the writer and producer did a good job. If you like ""secret agent"" based comedy, or if you liked the original Get Smart you will love this movie."
2,"Ha-Ha, boy, was this funny?","The main problem with this movie: it was'nt that funny. I think I laughed once, maybe twice. Normally, Steve Carell is very funny; but he had nothing to work with here. Terence Stamp, a great actor, is totally wasted in this punishing film as the main villian, Siegfried. Anne Hathaway was completely forgettable as, er, I forget. And someone please tell Alan Arkin to stop sleeping on the set...oh, he was awake? Could of fooled me..One laugh was generated by Bill Murray, playing Agent 13. Besides that, I can't think of much else that made me laugh. This was a comedy? Good points: Nice crisp,clear picture and this was a free rental."
1,Worst Comedy Ever,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen.I'm not usually into comedies, but thought that this could be a good opportunity to start. Did not laugh more that twice (and very little) and could not watch the movie more than 20 minutes.Would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you want to have a good opportunity to make a perfect negative comment."
3,Spy spoof that missed it by that much,"These days it seems they are doing a remake of everything. And seldom do the remakes match, let alone exceed the original. AndI`m afraid this one is no exception. It`s not an awful film, it`s worth watching, but it comes no where near to being as funnyas the original Get Smart."
3,"Somewhat Funny Movie, Wife HATED it","It was somewhat funny but not as funny as I expected. As stated the wife HATED it and walked out early.They tried to combine the action adventure and the comedy as was done in the series and wound up with a little of neither. By far not the best.Rent, do not buy."
4,as good as the original,clever and catchy. as funny as the tv show with new great characters that amaze! don't miss this film. it's a really great watch.
5,Can't be beat,"I don't usually like these kinds of movies. I am more of a Disney fan, but for some reason this one really tripped my trigger. I love how it is relatively clean, and has a fun balance between action, adventure and silliness. I pull it out whenever I need a good laugh."
2,taking stupid to a new hight,"this movie makes the orignal max smart a genius. did not even make it half way through the movie before having too stop watching due to way too much stupidityIf it wern't for Anne Hathaway (t.n.a.) and the Rock. Now I like goofy movies, but this went a little past that point. RENT FIRST before buying. who knows, maybe it will be better the second or third time I try watching this movie"
2,Not smart to see this movie. :),"My personal opinion of the movie only; no comparisons will be made to the original TV series:This movie had some of the lamest jokes I have ever seen and heard. Many times it appears they are making up their lines as they go, but they can't come up with anything funny.There are some funny scenes in the movie, not hilarious, because the scenes are not pushed far enough to make it hilarious.example: The dance battle between the two main characters was poorly choreographed, too slow, and not silly enough to make it funny.example: Laser room scene, again not pushed far enough to make it really funny.example: lady in bakery coming on to the main characterBasically that's the problem with the movie, it's just not pushed far enough to make it truly hilarious. Most of the jokes were just lazy and come across as very cheesy."
1,Stupid,"How this movie is getting such good ratings is beyond me.It just goes to show that people will like anything these days.People are such simpletons that I guess doesn't take much to amuse them.This movie is so stupid and no I am not comparing it to the tv show,I never even watched it.This movie was not funny nor did it have a good plot.Maybe I don't get Steve Carrel's humor,I don't know but I'm not gonna waste my time writing a long review for this horrid movie.I think they should stop making tv shows into movies.(Miami Vice,Land Of The Lost)It seems that it doesn't work."
1,Horrible,"Bloody horrible.Generally love Steve Carrell, The Rock & the rest. But this film is right up there with the biggest piles of crap ever shot. Stunned & confused as to how people actually like this.???? Somebody? .... Pfft.... Anyway...... Maybe they were all dropped on the head prior to watching this? Only explanation really...Anyone with any taste, avoid this like the plague. Up there with ""North"", ""Jingle All The Way"" & ""League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" as the worst films ever.P.S. I wanted to give this zero stars, but for some reason it would not let me."
1,Pretty Lame,"A read a review that called Get Smart ""Staggeringly Bad"". Now, although I won't go that far, it was pretty bad, and not very funny at all. I watched it thinking that I might enjoy it if i tried to seperate it from the TV series, but it was still bad. The movie gave only passing reference to the players and comic genius of the original series. It seemed as though they were just trying to get those catch phrases and support characters out of the way so they could continue with whatever it was they were trying to do here.I would suggest browsing around Amazon and buying the original series on DVD if you want some real humor. The original series is even relevant today with its use of humor. That's the true sign of real comedy."
1,"Fell Asleep,,,Dumb...Bore...Not ""Get Smart""","I really like both actors that starred in this movie...which is why I rented it. Also, I grew up on the original tv series ""Get Smart"". I thought the two would be a great combination, unfortunately, my husband and I both fell asleep (I struggled to watch it at all) about 2/3 through the movie. IT IS AWFUL...nothing worth watching...don't waste your money!"
1,Fantastic show - horrid price =(,Everything about Cardcaptor Sakura is wonderful as it truly is an enchanting and captivating series that most people will fall in love with - but the last price this second dvd set was at was around 800$ which is like ridiculous!!
2,Another One Bites The Dust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! not another band that I love geos soft. I don't even know what to say i am so mad... This deosn't even sound like Millencolin, except for songs 2 and 8. He changed his voice on this record... i dont know why. It sounds [worse] than their last album which rocked to no tommorrow. If you like thier last album and you get this one iam warning you it is totally different..."
3,Hot Stuff,"I was so excited to get this curry paste. The flavor was good if you can get past the heat. Wow, it is hot. My boyfriend goes to Thai resturants and orders Thai hot and then asks for some more hot sauce. He even said it was hot. The next time I make it I'll try adding less paste and additional coconut milk."
3,Just ok,I bought this brand because it was all they had at Ranch 99 near us. I find it spicy (hot) but not enough flavor. I would have rather bought Maesri Thai Green Curry Paste. It is much much more flavorful and spicy.
3,"An Okay Practice Reader - a review of ""Toad on the Road""","While this book is apparently popular with preschoolers (see other reviews), I can only give it a Three-Star grade as a practice reader. The main problem in my opinion is that there is just not enough story here to justify buying the book for a child to practice with, unless you were going to get it for them as a preschooler, and then let them read it later, or else use it with younger siblings.The artwork is colorful and bright, and there is rhyming, but the silly story (a good thing), isn't one that's likely to keep older children coming back for week after week. Not like the ""Little Bear"" and Seuss stories, or the ""Frog and Toad ""books.The Accelerated Reader designation is 1.5 by the way, which means that this book is suitable practice for children reading at the mid-First Grade level. [More accurately at a level of the 5th month of First Grade.]Pam T~"
5,A pre-Sopranos classic.,"From the first surreal scene, the dialogue in The Deli is funny and original. With too many stars and cameos to mention, this movie will remind you of The Sopranos (it features three members of the Soprano cast), and if you like that show, you will love The Deli."
2,A waste of talent,"This movie has an all star cast but is so horrid. It is so funny to watch how horrible the movie is. Do not buy it, please save your money and buy shaft! This movie is so corny it is like you woke up in a comedy of Goodfellas."
1,"French Press, Not a Neopolitan","While this appears to be a very attractive French Press unit, it is most definitely NOT a Neopolitan flip over type coffee maker. The seller should revise the description."
5,love it love it love it buy it buy it buy it!,loooooooooveeeeee....i absoulutley positively love this cd!!! not only is it as good as the new one it is better. it talks more to kids. it is really good. teens and pre-teens do feel like no one understands them! so if u are a teen or pre-teen i highly highly highly recommend this cd! dont listen to no crap rap. this cd is much better for those days when they dont go right. pierre has a special voice for this cd and tops the great music background off!!i'd do anything is the greatest track in the whole world. it is so catchy. and addicted is reaaallly good too. they are the special rock love songs!on the other hand perfect and im just a kid is more about the down sides of life.this cd is great. and u are great if u buy it. if u dont buy it then ur not great. omg pierre is soo damn cute.
1,Insulting,"You know how when your little sister or brother is watching barney on TV, and you over here a song and it gets stuck in you head for days. This is very much like that. It painfully plays all day long in your head while you screem inside your mind ""MAKE IT STOP!!!"". The facts that kids my age (17) actually listen to this stuff really makes me kinda shocked. No I'm not making fun of anyone, but this IS pretty childish stuff. Its actually sad. I wonder if the people who listen to this are like Peter Pan or something on the inside. I mean common, they said it themselves ""I dont wanna be told to grow up."" This should speak for itself. I dont usually like to band music, but you really shouldn't own this if you are over 12."
1,Actually zero stars,"This may be in my opinion the worst piece of crap band I have ever heard in my life. They're so terrible they may me want to puke or blow my head off to stop that terrible noise. Worst than boy bands, even worst than cancer, this is the most horrible music I have ever heard."
4,Good Start,"For their first CD, these guys hit the nail on the head. It had catchy songs and, even though they get a naggy teenager bad rep to them because of it, the younger generation connects well with it. They sing to their peers, which should be every group. This doesn't happen all over however and when groups decide to do so, they are chastized for it. This is a CD that will hit all young generations, which will make them wanna continue to listen as they progress in time. These songs make you think they will swear and use the language that wouldn't make acceptable for all audiences, however they stay clear of that, which is amazing for young groups to do. In ""Addicted"" they go out of their way just to say ""dick"" in their song. But even that is done in a way that isn't made dirty. Complete respect for any group that can do that."
5,This Album Rocks!!![.],"This album Rocks!!! It's better then the first release. sure its mostly the samething but this ones got 2 extra tracks! It has ""Grow Up"" from the scooby-doo ST and a Christmas song!!![.] PLUS, thats right PLUS, it has 3 videos, ""i'm just a kid"", ""do Anything"", and some never before seen footage with ""i'm just a kid"" instramental! Its off the heezie fo sheezie!"
4,"Good, Fast Music that you can Relate to","I thought this CD was great. The only thing was that I wished they would have had a couple more slow songs (only one) but otherwise its great. But people who enjoy ""hardcore"" punk rock aren't going to like this one. It's kind of like Good Charlotte (some of the band members sing in some of the songs). I recommend this CD."
1,AHHH HELP ME,This is the worst peice of crap ive ever heard....the guy sounds like a whiney little chipmunk which drives me crazy....i love cananda but why did they have to bring these guys here ahhhh....if u want a good canadian actual punk band listen to propaghandi but this is the worst excuse for a punk band ive ever heard...there annoying and there lyrics are even worse...dont buy this unless your an 12 year old who doesnt know better.
1,No stars at all,"Hi I hate simple plan, their music has no depth, it's just ""Come on kids listen to our really bad music"". One of my closest friends like them and that sucks. Everytime my brother puts on their sophomore album, I tell him to turn it off."
1,more generic pop punk/emo,"Here's another example of how sad the popular music scene is at the moment.I guess the good thing is that most of the people buying this album are 12, and think they're punk.Don't worry kids, you'll grow out of that phase.If you want to listen to some good pop punk/emo, check out the Reputation or Rainer Maria's new album.Once again, the girls have to show the boys how to rock...buy this album if you like Good Charlotte, or the Ataris.They've been having success with the ""12 yr old punk"" scene."
3,Great!,Great cd! If you love Simple Plan you should give Sugarcult a try...and pass it on to all your friends! Enjoy!
3,"Not bad, but it doesn't stand out","I don't know why I got this cd but I did, and it grew on me. It's nothing like real punk yet all the mtv kids think it is. It's catchy but it sounds like all the other bands that mtv plays and calls punk. Besides the lead singer's voices if you put all the bands on a cd and gave them to someone, they wouldn't be able to tell them apart. But still God Must Hate Me, I'd Do Anything, When I'm With You and Perfect are some really good songs, even if the lyrics are a bit simple. Buy this if you need a new Good Charlotte clone."
5,'Simple' listening,"No Pads..No Helmets..Just Balls..the name speaks for itself. This cd is a refreshing album with a fun, care free sound that is perfect for listening to anywhere. The songs best describe today's youth as they are angry and rebelious..this album makes being a kid a little more tolerable. A fun cd! Simple PLan are the real deal..definitely check them out!"
4,good music,"I dont understand why everybody hates this CD because it is not ""punk"". Tell me please, what is punk. I think that maybe music in general is evolving, and this just happens to fit the bill for today. I dont think that It will be one of those CDs that stands the test of time, but I think its one of the best CDs of today. I think thats all that matters, and not whether or not its punk, or whether the lyrics are too ""poppy"". Just listen to the CD, dont go in with a biased opinion, hoping to hear this perfect ""Punk"" music. Listen to the music these guys put out there for you to hear, and if you dont like it, turn it off and quit B**ching."
4,Canadians!,"These pop-punk Canadian rockers are awesome! They capture the teen anger. Hating your parents, missing a loved one, CHRISTMAS!!!, and a lot more! I promise you that you'll be singing along to these catchy songs! ""My Alien"" is a hilarious song! (I think the title gives you a bit of a hint.)No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls includes the 3 singles ""I'd Do Anything"", ""Addicted"", and ""Perfect"".Don't forget to listen to the VERY end of the CD. It has a bonus track at the end of Track 13! And remember to put it in your CD-ROM to get the special enhanced features!"
1,this album is rubbish by it and laugh.,This album takes everything bad about punk and puts it in a album.
1,simple plan is afwul,simple plan just dress like there punk but release music that is crappy pop. its afwul
1,This band is a joke and an insult to punk,"Am i the only one who thinks guys in their late twentys singingabout tests and crashing dads car is a little odd? Punk is supposed to be intense, honest and anti-mainstream, not stoopingdown to twelve-year-olds who just outgrew N'SYNC. How can a bandthat opens for avril lavigne have the balls to call itself punk?I can't wait till punk stops being cool and all of you trendy teenybopper posers stop creating a market for horrible ""punk"" bands like this and listen to something else."
5,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!,"I'm just a kid and I'd do anything to hear more of simple plan. I am addicted their music. A day that I don't listen to this Cd it's the Worst day ever. All the people who think this band might be a one hit wonder, then you don't mean thing to me. Hopefully One Day I'll meet you there in Concert. God must hate m because everwhere I went to buy this CD it was sold out. Luckily My alien from Mexico got me the found one.Hey! Simple Plan when you come to my town I won't be there. :-(But I'll say Hi When I'm with you backsatge.(i wish)There's one word to describe this CD. PERFECT!That was tough to do and corny. But I have nothing better to do while i'm listenig to this CD."
4,Great but gets old,"I love this CD, Simple Plan is a great band. My favorite songs are ""I'd Do Anything"", ""The Worst Day Ever"", ""I'll Meet You There"", ""Addicted"", and the touching ballad ""Perfect"". I can really relate to it, but it just gets old fast. But it's definetly worth a listen & an add to your collection."
1,Punk/Pop gets closer to N'Sync,"This band takes a genre that used to be fun and rebellious one step closer to a genre full of boy bands like N'Sync. Their music and lyrics are horrible. They prance around in the videos just trying to attract the young female crowd...attract that crowd, and you are set for a while...at least until the next cute boy group comes along. If many more bands like this come along, this genre will be ruined completely. Just like what Nu Metal has done to actual metal music. Do the rest of us a favor and do not support this band, if you do, it will only fuel more."
5,Loved it!,"I love this cd! Pierre has a very very cute voice. I love their songs Perfect,Addicted,and id do anything! I think this cd was great. They sound like fun outgoing guys and there is nothing in their songs that is dirty or disgusting like most music today. The music isnt really like rock or anything hardcore its popish rock! it sounds really really good though!"
3,UGH!!!,"The guys from Simple Plan might be hot, but they cant sing!!! especially on ""perfect"", i mean if they sound that flat and off-key with having the technology to enhance their voices, just think how bad they'll sound live..."
1,This isn't punk,"It's a boy band, They were dressed up to look hardcore and put on mtv.This isn't punk, it's pop.Listen to some real music.Don't exploit something you know nothing about."
1,BLAH!! It's NSYNC with guitars!!!,"I hate this cd, I loathe this cd. I hate this band its like listening to NSYNC or Backstreet Boys with guitars. BLEEEEHHH!!! Bad music!! Why are they on Warped Tour?!?!? They don't belong there!! They should be on some pop tour or something. Music like this shouldn't be made, it's just adding to the pollution problems we have. BLAH!! enjoi."
5,AWSOME!!!,"I msut admit... Im ""addicted"" to this cd! IT is so awsome. Simple Plan is my favorite band! I HIGHLY recommend this cd to anyone."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Simple Plan is so great, I love their music! If you like rock you'll love this! All the songs are great and the song Perfect shows that nobody can be or is perfect. The meaning of their songs are great and they write all their songs themselves. This Cd really rocks! Get their other Cd's too! I recommend all their Cd's, they're just so great!"
2,*yawn*,"It's obvious that Simple Plan is primarily aiming for the younger teens with this. At least I hope they are. The lead singer is not very good, and his voice may grate on your nerves. People bash Avril because they say she is a poser. Avril's never said she's putting out punk music. These guys believe they're punk....they aren't. Still, if you like sugar-coated, trl/radio friendly pop...with the tiniest breath of punk in it, then by all means, you can't go wrong here. If you want real punk rock, go with AFI. I would also like to urge you to check out KILL HANNAH, a little known band whose cd is coming out sometime next month."
1,Oh what now?,"I suppose Barney is going to come back to the radio and start wearing stuuded bracelets and baggy jeans and singing about stupid stuff just like these losers are. I don't own this CD, but I really don't want to. I can hardly tell the bands Good Charlotte and Simple Plan apart. I'm not a hater. I just don't like these talentless wannabe girly boy bands.I""ve heard the songs perfect(these are from GC also)Welcome to my Life, I just wanna live, Lifstyles of the Rich and Famous and they all suck!!!! please, if you are a smart person boycott bands like SP, GC, Bowling for Soup, YellowCard, and more. Listen to bands like No Doubt, Nirvana, B52's,Evanesence. At least those bands produce enjoyable music~!"
1,"Simple by name, simply tedious punk-pop by nature","Ever since a certain Berkley trio unleashed the petulant lyric ""listen to me whine"", there's been no end of bands queuing up to unburden their litany of woes. Canuck five-piece Simple Plan are one such outfit, quick to illustrate that they too can moan about how life is so damn unfair, with a canon of songs so depressingly pedestrian you simply can't imagine just how difficult growing up must have been for them.""No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls"" is an abominable listening experience, crammed full of soulessly crafted gems as turgid as ""The Worst Day Ever"". Even contributions from Blink 182's Mark Hoppus and Good Charlotte's Joel Madden fail to prevent this record from sounding as if it's scraped the last remnants from the pop-punk barrel."
2,Wow... Simple...,"Well these guys are not neccesarily good, they are just simple. Lets see, a melody here, a catchy little line here, and all the kids are GONNA BUY IT! Listen, don't buy this album, its simple, this band is not creative, they dont make interesting music. If you want a good punk album, buy the new NOFX album ""War On Errorism"" or their classic ""The Decline"". They are MUCH better albums. Please I urge you to not waste your money on this cd, its not worth the buy, alright? You'd be amused longer with a stick and a rock than with ""No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls"""
4,Here's Why:,"This c.d. is really good just some of the words aren't poetic.But, anyway,this is a good c.d. and all of you avril haters will love it. My personal favorites are:1.I'd do anything2.I'm just a kid3.addicted4.perfect.If you like the following bands you would probably like Simple Plan:1.Good Charlotte(good charlotte is a little more hardcore though)2.Blink-182 (a little more parental advisory if you know what I mean)3.Sum-41 (More hardcore)Just for the record, I'd like to say these people aren't punk- or even pop-punk for that matter, but that doesen't mean that the music is bad or anything. It seems everyone who hates them hates them 'cause they aren't punk enough. I thought the whole point of being punk was about hating people who hated you 'cause of what you wore or for being different. Try judging them for the MUSIC instead."
1,You Ain't Hardcore. LOL,"Please. I bet these guys listened to H2O nonstop and made a band just totally ripping 'em. If you want to hear a good non-sellout band that does music like Simple Plan, that started before there ever was a Simple Plan and everyone copied them, find yourself an H2O album."
2,Well....,"Wannabes. There lyrics are good, but...THERE F'ing RETARDED. If they want to be emo, they dont f'ing be shallow. I mean look at there cover. They like, want to be cool or something. Retards."
4,don't hate on these..,if you like feel good music...then this album is for you..there is some catchy songs and good riffs...and i think their music rocks!!...any of you that are hating on this band then you need to sort yourself out...id like to see you do better..
1,crap,"so i should go into depth on this. many of those ""hated this cd"" reviews are longwinded crap themselves, so i'm gonna try to make this interesting to you,my eleven year old trying to break away from his parents friend.now many of these dudes on here bash greenday, but i like them. theyre good. they came out with dookie, and now they've matured big deal. simple plan will never mature, they'll die thirteen and bitching. blink 182 i dont like. but they still at least try to grasp fans over 12 with there greedy paws.simple plan is good and dandy and fun if youve had a brain anurism. they wanna b punk, and give them a pat on the head and the finger for their troubles.good luck."
5,PERFECT FOR AGES 3 AND UP,"I bought this cd for my 3 year old today (her choice!!) and it is definatly age appropriate. no swearing or sexual innuendos to be found!! so i rate it 5 for the kiddies!! and it even has a perfect song :im just kidi also applaud simple plan for making an album that is appropriate for the age of their fanbase....ages 3 and up.if you are a parent and your juvenile son or daughter are begging for this album and you just arent sure, you have absolutly nothing to worry about from this marshmallow of an album."
1,Laughable...very...,"Yeah, I saw these guys Summer 2002 when I went to the Green Day/Blink-182/Jimmy Eat World concert. I had never heard of them before so I figured I would watch them. They put on a pretty boring show. My friend burned me their CD and I have got to say I think this is the worst CD I have. The vocals are really whiney, simple guitar riffs, and the lyrics...oh my god. They are absolutely terrible. Did the lead singer write these when he was 12? Former BSB and N'Sync fans, now that that trend has passed...here you go. Just remember, no matter how hard you try or how hard the band thinks they are, this is NOT PUNK...this is NOT EVEN POP-PUNK. This is borderline boy-band genre."
2,OK but gets boring after a while,"Yeah I think this album has only a few good songs. Like the first track ""I'd do anything""(featuring the great Mark Hoppus) and ""I'm just a kid"". Those are my favorite songs. The rest of the album is ok but it's way to poppy and It gets so boring after a while. I mean I like pop/punk and all but this is like really POP with some punk influence. But don't get me wrong they kickass live. After a few listens to it the cover and booklet photos are the only interesting thing. Well if you like a poppier version if Blink 182, give it a listen."
5,amazing,"when i first heard the song id do anything on my local radio station, i was eager to see who were the artists of this song. my friend, who is a big punk/emo fan started blaring the same cd in his car a few days later and it didnt disappoint. simple plan's style of punk rock is impressive as well as their lyrical diversity in their songs. i would recommend this album to any punk/emo fan."
3,Better Albums Like This Out There,"I purchased this album as an alternative to Good Charlotte. They do sound somewhat similar to GC, but Pierre Bouvier's voice sounds like he hasn't puberty, and it really gets on your nerves. I really don't think these guys can be considered ""punk"" because they sing with almost no anger. Many of the song are childish pop songs like #5, #8, #9, #10, and #12. I think a 10 year old could write most of these lyrics, and they have the same guitar riffs. It sounds like every song repeats itself. I do have to give them credit for ""You Don't Mean Anything"" which is a really good song. I probably like it because it includes Joel Madden of GC. I also do like ""Worst Day Ever"", but besides that I really don't think this album is worth putting money into if you're a hardcore punk fan. If you're a punk-pop fan then you should consider putting this into your album, but make sure to check out both of Good Charlotte's albums."
1,"No Pads, No Helmets...No Balls!!!","This has got to be the worst attempt at musicianship I have ever seen! All these (...) do is whine about how their life is ""such a nightmare"" and how ""god must hate them"". They just write whiny songs like these so pre-teens and little kids can feel sorry for them and hopefully buy their CDs. This CD is not pop-punk or pop-rock it is just straight up commerialized POP for all the woe-is-me hottopic posuers."
2,* Just Balls...Right... *,"I've read some of these reviews absolutley cutting Simple Plan apart, and I mean, that's going a bit far. Ok, so they're pretty poppy, but the world can't just be full of groups like Hoobastank and AFI.As the songs go...well...you know. To be honest, I don't really know. They're not absolutley awful and yet they're not absolutley brilliant. They're just sort of nothing.But if you want to get into sort of punky music, I guess this is a good place to start. It's pretty soft and will ease you in. While I'm not ripping Simple Plan apart, I'm not praising them either. Just, before you judge, have a listen to this album."
3,This album is ok!,"I love ""Addicted"", ""My Alien"", and ""Perfect""; the songs are great! If you don't have this album, I urge you to buy it! Just kidding!"
1,Simple Plan are Annoying!,"This is one of THE most annoying abnds I have ever heard...in fact, it may truly be the worst I have ever heard. ""Addicted"" is horrible, the lead singer has the worst, most whiny voice I have ever heard. Even Good Charlotte can write better songs than them, and I hate Good Charlotte.I don't know what else to say except I f*cking hate this band."
2,Hard to get past the editing errors...,"While this book could potentially give business neophytes many good suggestions, the overabundance of spelling errors and lack of editing makes it hard to take seriously and shows a lack of professionalism.I found myself unable to get past the completely substandard editing and ultimately put the book on the shelf. Maybe I should just send it back..."
2,loaded with errors--terrible editing,"While this book gives good advice in a straight-forward and honest manner, the author apparently does not follow her own advice regarding checking your work before releasing it. The book is riddled with grammar and spelling errors of all sorts. As a marketing professional myself, I find this unacceptable. The editor(s) of this book did a terrible job, lowering it's value considerably; it's hard to take anything in it seriously when, within the first 9 or 10 pages, I found at least four errors, and that was only the beginning. The entire book is riddled with errors. I'm considering returning it for this reason alone."
5,Great value,"This is the first inversion table that I've ever used. After back surgery and steroid injections I wish I would've tried it sooner. I have improved to almost 100% since I have used this table. The quality is durable too. I am 6'4"" and over 200 lbs and I never feel afraid that the thing will collapse on me. Best money I've ever spent on my health."
4,Inversion Table,"Went together with no problems, and works great....assuming I am using it as designed."
3,Could be Designed Better,"For a home-type Gravity Inversion Table, the Calm 55-1532 by Stamina is okay. I've had absolutely no trouble with it. The only thing I would change about it, though, is the 'bar' or 'foam' that is right at the buttocks level when laying on it. It cuts into the buttocks and is uncomfortable. Due to this reason, it is impossible to stay on it as long as one would like. This part is NOT adjustable, either, because it is built in to the 'bed' of the table. I would definately spend a little more on a slightly better designed one next time. If it weren't for this one problem, I'd rate it good-excellent."
3,Inversion Table,"On a positive note, the Stamina Gravity Inversion Table is well built for home use and easy to put together. On the negative side, its pretty hard on the feet making it uncomfortable. I also tend to slide down in the inverted position making it difficult to get back up."
1,What a joke! I want my money back!,This movie is Absolutly nothing like the book! I wonder if the person who decided to make this movie understood what the story was about. And the price that I paid for this movie...I'm pissed!
5,very clear and thorough,"It was very clear and thorough. It is a pretty guide review for the Clep exam, but you will need to study Principles of Accounting II also for the Principles of Accounting CLEP."
4,It Can't Happen Here,"This novel was written decades ago - we relive, however, the uncertainty and fear of those days.In times of eroding civil liberties and increasingly secretive American governmental power over and intrusion into the lives of all citizens, this book is a MUST READ for every citizen."
1,Not my first or last choice - under the right conditions I'd use again,"Slow to ship, slow shipping (media mail), over charged for slow shipping (charged more than priority shipping rate for media mail), and book was not in as good a quality as advertised. Inside cover - first leaf has area cut/removed that is about the size of a bar code sticker. I suspect this was a library book that has been resold. No clear evidence of this as there are no stamps that say belongs to ""X"" library, but the first page is cut. This dramatically reduces the value of the book. A collector of excellent condition first editions, as this book was advertised, would not be satisfied with such undisclosed damage. The rest of the book is in good condition - but not collection quality because of damage."
3,"Good, But Not Cather's Best","""A Lost Lady"" is a good read and any experience with Willa Cather's outstanding writing is worth your time, but it's not her best story. ""My Antonia"" is best followed by ""O' Pioneers"". Start with those and then by all means read this and everything else that is Cather. She's GREAT!!"
1,Don't Buy This Book. Get Another Lost Lady,"I bought this book for a friend. The description says 21 archival photos. That may be in other editions of this book but what I got was the worst print on demand that I've ever seen, with NO pictures. There's a SPELLING error on the back cover. It's the main character's name. Cather spells it Niel and Wilder Pub spells it Neil. Cather has has her own way of spelling things--practise--for example is wrong in every book of hers that I've read. There are others. So did she mean to mispell Niel or did the people who decided to use her work for their profit just not read the book? Good question.NG"
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I had to read this for a college class, and I wasn't thrilled about it. However, I absolutely loved it. Cather will definitely be a new staple in my collection."
5,Best bang for the buck!,"I purchased this gun and I love it. It's made out of plastic, but it's thick plastic so it looks and feels solid. The gun shoots dead straight, even when in full auto mode. You can really unleash with this airsoft gun. The battery hasn't died on me yet. When I received the package, I expected to have to charge the battery, but it came charged and it hasn't died yet! I have shot close to 700+ bb's with it and the battery still works great. The accessories are fun also. They all work, so it makes for more fun. If you're considering getting a beginner/intermediate level gun, this is it!"
2,What a donkey,"The book seems to spend more time on lampooning its curious cast of characters than actually explaining the Internet economy or how startups work. If you listen to Wolff too closely, you'll end up thinking that starting a company consists mainly in begging for money. I was pretty amazed at how consistently disgusting his reasoning is. He maligns everyone he comes in contact with for being greedy and stupid, but by the end of the book you can see that he is the best example of both. Somewhat interesting for its insight into how even successful startups are often going from day to day trying to figure out how to make payroll. In the end, though, I think a lot of books provide more insight while annoying less."
5,Star Trek - The Motion Picture: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition),I knew this movies. Years left I saw it. I have all Star Trek Picture. I love it.Cindy
3,Not really an improvement.,"Overall the Director's Cut is an improvement in terms of sound, visual effects, and pace. And yet, i still prefer my VHS copy of the 143-minute version. Certain key scenes were deleted from the DVD, including some tender moments between Ilia and Decker, and some dialogue between McCoy and Kirk regarding Spock's obsession with V'Ger. The Ilia/Decker relationship is not as fully developed in this new cut, which is aggravating because it is that relationship that facilitates the ending of the film and gives it significance. If Robert Wise wanted to trim scenes, why not cut some more of those endless shots of V'Ger's inner layers, instead of interesting dialogue that actually contributes to the plot and characters' development. Having said all that, I suppose the DVD will please audiophiles and those who go ga-ga over CGI technology."
2,BORING,"I hadn't seen this movie in about 15 years and really couldn't remember why I didn't like it before. I bought this hoping that I would be surprised and enjoy the movie. I like all the star trek movies except for this one. It puts me to sleep when i watch it. It is bogged down with all the special effects they experimented with on this movie. The shots in outer space are just too long and should have been cut down. It seems like there are moments in the movie that last near 10 minutes with no dialog, but just the crew looking and reacting to what they see in space. VERY BORING. The dvd is nicely done with plenty of extras including deleted scenes, some of which would have made the movie more fun if included. Don't waste your time with this movie, buy one of the other star trek movies instead."
4,"""I...am...Nomad--er, that is, V'Ger""","STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE reunites the cast of the original TV series--for the first time since the show was cancelled in the late '60s--as the famous Starship Enterprise is sent to investigate an alien entity that is heading towards Earth and leaving death and destruction in its wake.Basically a thinly disguised rewrite of the classic STAR TREK episode ""The Changeling,"" the film itself is, for most part, of interest only to die-hard TREK fans. However, the new DVD version has been cleaned up and improved in several ways, and the package also includes a disc of extras--tidbits such as documentaries and deleted scenes--that should appeal to casual TREK fans and aficionados alike.[Note: If...allowed a multiple rating system, this DVD would be recommended as a 5-star disc to die-hard Trekkers and a 4-star disc to all other viewers. The VHS version, sans clean-up and extras, would offer only a 3-star rating to both viewing groups.]"
4,Who Doesn't Love Star Trek!!,"While not my favorite Star Trek movie, this first one was well done with great details and sci-fi! This is a must see before you watch any of the later movies."
4,Star Trek 1,Packaging and disks were fine. Dialog audio was awful. Had to turn it up so loud that music and sound effects broke the sound barrier. One wonders if the fault lies with the supplier or the production company.
