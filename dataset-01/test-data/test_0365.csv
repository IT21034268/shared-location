5,Excellent Book but Heart Breaking,"This is a very detailed account of the surviving Mengele Twins. By the end of the book, you feel like you personally know each person. I enjoyed how the book was written in accounts from the Twins and then what was happening in Mengele's life. Excellent book!"
3,Poor but has moments...,"This album was one of Klaus's 80's, creatively stuck, material. Over all it's OK a return to some older ideas and rehash of different things most obvious is the final track which goes back to Mirage days only more updated and modern. Other tracks are almost abstract or minimalist stuff.. I'd heard this album was a step forward for him but really not much of one. Poor."
5,This baby really shines!,"When they say widebeam, they really mean it! The grip on the flashlight is comfortable, and operating it is a snap. The led light is pure white and covers half a room at a time. It's lightweight but sturdy, and a great addition to any tool box."
4,Changed my whole aspect of college,I just survived my first year at college. I was so worried about my grades and keeping my GPA up that I never thought about the other aspect of it. College is not just about making the grades but gaining life-long experience that will help you further.Finding your purpose in life cannot be done without our creator GOD. Read the book called The Purpose Driven Life by Rick
3,Pretty good!,"Hip music, makes me feel young, often very bouncy, got a great UK feel to it..... I would like to hear more from this band."
4,Good sound,The first song i hear was the first track. After hearing to the whole album i can definetly say that i enjoyed the whole album. I especially enjoyed the girls voice its very good
1,Don't Buy,"I own several Gerber products and have always been very pleased. This is the first that has disappointed me. The knife does not lock into the plastic sheath, so if you invert it, the knife will separate from the sheath. The retaining strap on the sheath will catch the hilt of the knife, but this is very loose at best. The blade arrived blunt, very disappointed. The black finish chipped off as I had it clamped in my sharpener, again very disappointing. Awesome looking design, very poor execution. Buy something else."
4,Biblical and Balanced,"MacArthur's treatment on Christian stewardship is a biblical and balanced study of what the Scriptures teach about money. MacArthur avoids the pitfalls of the prosperity gospel, while affirming the goodness of God in providing for his children's needs. He avoids the pitfall of legalistic teaching about tithing, while encouraging the New Testament principles of generous, proportionate, cheerful giving. His exposition of 2 Corinthians 8-9, which covers three or four chapters, is superb. His basic understanding of stewardship is soundly rooted in Scripture. His explanation of the true meaning of tithing in the Old Testament is persuasive. His application of Scripture to contemporary financial issues such as debt and gambling is needed and helpful. I found this a very wise book (typically John MacArthur), full of Scripture and true to life. I would highly recommend it!"
4,Good Biblical Perspective on Money,"Overall, this is a good book. It gives a biblical view of money and how the Christian should use and respond to it. MacArthur gives biblical warnings and guidelines about money. He also talks about the neutral morality of money.MacArthur also uses Scripture to describe Biblical stewardship and the Biblical model for giving to the Church or other organizations that promote the Gospel of Christ.There are nine chapters in this book. Each chapter focuses on one aspect of money. At the end of the book is a brief summary of each chapter with some questions that can be used as a study guide to focus on the important aspects of that chapter. MacArthur also includes some ideas to focus on during your prayer time as well as some scriptures to memorize and apply in your life.This is a good book to read for anyone interested in learning a Biblical perspective on money. Of course as a Christian we need to remember that our true riches are in Heaven."
5,I'm Just Wild About Harry,"This film is a thrilling representation of the art of documentary Film. For Nilsson buffs, powder puffs, Hunter Thompson fans, or weary field hands. The movie is a spiritual, cautionary, historical tale of an abandoned American boy who became the 'fifth Beatle.' I found it a little hard to stomach the pain that some of the intervieweeswere clearly struggling with. But the pathos in their remembrances makes you understand his music all the more."
5,Harry would have liked it.,"I'm a huge, long time Harry Nilsson fan and this was an excellent film that, I believe, really showed the true Harry Nilsson. To the person who found it ""mean spirited""- in my opinion, you're simply wrong. Anyone that ""knows"" Harry or followed his career at all should have been aware of his troubles. Little in the film was surprising, but all was worth seeing. The true love and endearment that every interviewee, to a person, had for Harry was apparent throughout the film. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend ""Who is Harry""."
4,Great Documentary!,"I have heard a little of his music but was more familiar with him for John Lennon's ""lost weekend"". This documentary does a great job filling in the complete backstory including quotes about Nilsson called by some as the greatest singer in the world at that time. Listening to some of the music and listening to his friends as well as his producer Perry give a real feel how gifted he was. Also, the different family members had a lot to say to add a total picture. This is not a short documentary but has great interviews and past footage. But it's a worthwhile story to hear the great but tragic story of Nillson."
4,Good book however not for a beginner,"This book is pretty good, there is not nearly enough information contained within for you to be able to pass the Written exam. It is good for someone with a few years experience and a little knowledge. Dont think that this book is going to help you get certified all alone. It is just a starter book."
1,Save your money the Cisco CDROM is free.,The Catalyst chapter was not even a chapter it was one long show command. The typos were horrific... Save your money the Cisco CDROM is free.
4,Buy this book,"Giles' book is better for the written exam, but use Caslow in your lab preparation. Caslow's chapter on Frame Relay alone is worth the price of admission."
4,Makes you think about *WHY* you're doing XYZ tasks,"This book certainly will not teach you the routing protocols in depth. It's not meant as a comprehensive book on different topics. Where it will help you is ""WHY AM I configuring it with XYZ instead of ABC??"" type of questions. It does have a great chapter on FR in general. When you should use 'frame map..' commands and what the implications are of using (relying on) inverse arp, for example. The ""Can you spot the issues"" are great tools to make you think about what you're doing."
3,Don't believe that Michael Wosnicki has ever read this book,That guy gives every book a 5. He is a paid jerk to rate all books 5 stars. Please make him stop posting reviews! He wouldn't know a csu/dsu if it hit him in the head.
3,This book has everything to become a 1000 star rated book,"however, it is indeed too general, too much to the surface, does not come with strategies (I wonder where the title comes from). however, as a pro in the industrie, I do think that if this and if above readers critism is taken seriously and therefor reprinted in a second edition, this book could be a toolbook to the industry, something everyone is looking for. Mr Dempsey had a lot of knowledge and experience in this industry,but like a medical surgeon is not writing a book about ""how to become a nurse"", i am sure that his view could be much more valuable to the the pro's in the industry if he would approach his view with info that counts indeed !I am looking forward to the 2nd ed !"
5,Perfect,"One of Soul Asylum's best, for sure. ""Artificial Heart"" is amazing...in fact, there isn't a bad song on here."
2,Hoping for better from Chuck's Future Net offerings,"I didn't hesitate to order this book after reading Chuck Martin's most excellent Digital Estate, which I thought was original, thought-provoking, and economically written. There was little new in Net Future, however, with strategies to forming the ""Netted Company"" being ideas you'd expect from a book published in 1996. The book was filled with lengthy examples of companies using the net in ho-hum ways. If you haven't read Digital Estate, read it! You can pass on Net Future and go straight to Kelly's New Rules for the New Economy or Downes' Unleashing the Killer App. I look for better things from Chuck in the future."
5,Enamelware mug,The mugs is exactly what I wanted. Since I could not find them in stores. I am happy to have found them on line.
5,great cup,"I love this cup. I originally bought it for use as a shaving mug, but use it instead for coffee,DONT PUT THIS IN MICROWAVE, the underlying material is metal, but it can be used directly on burner of gas range.It will get hot, so be careful of hands and lips touching the rim.I knew this before hand. And no worries about it smashing if dropped and shards of ceramic going into your foot.Enamel may chip off, if repeated drops- but it can take quite a beating.its just a nice versatile mug."
2,"Great at first, but has problems with chipping","We got these mugs for everyday use around the house (we're trying to reduce the amount of plastic our children drink from) but within a few weeks of regular use, the enamel started chipping off. We ended up having to throw them all away."
2,review,I do not recommend this coffee mug for drinking hot beverages. Cup gets too hot to handle or hold. This purchase was a complete waste of money for a coffee mug.
1,Dented,"I purchased two cups for a camping trip and was a little disappointed to find that they were both dented. Even if they were not damaged I probably would have returned them because the ""lip"" of the cup was a bit sharp and I was concerned that I would cut my lip when drinking from the cup."
2,1202F-8 Made in China,"I received my new Starrett 1202 and to my suprise the box was labeled ""Made in China."" I called Starrett because I was not sure if this was a knock off or what. They told me this tool is made in China and they have no comperable U.S. made product."
2,CD did not work in a standard player or computer in the US,"I rated this low only because the CD did not work. Other than that the experience was top-notch with both Amazon and the reseller.The product arrived shrink-wrapped but when I tried to play it my Sony 5-disc DVD player basically said ""Disk not found"" and skipped it. In a computer, Linux would not even recognize that a disk was in the drive. I ended up returning the CD and was happy with Amazon as they refunded the product cost and shipping. I know that DVD's have region encoding but I researched CDs and did not find any reason that it would not play. The CD is from Time-Warner and my only thought is that perhaps they put some DRM software on it that prevented it from working. I'll never know, but will likely avoid Time-Warner CDs."
2,Mailed wrong item,We specifically paid more and ordered from here so that we could have the camera with the cover shown here. What arrived was not what was shown but a different cover all together. We are very disappointed.
2,price and quality don't match up,"picture quality is terrible. Grainy doesn't start to describe it. You need batteries and an SD card, which is not included. My daughter had fun with it today, but I have a similar style flip camera that costs about the same right now, and the quality is FAR superior (internal memory, rechargable battery, pretty solid picture) to this. Seems like more of a $9.99 item, which it probably will be on clearance soon."
5,"Elope, Inc. has a super selection of gear for playtime dress-up","These hats are beautifully made and very well constructed -- a big step above any other play hats & costumes we've found.There are stores with better selections of these hats, as well as better prices. Be sure to Google around for the reversible hats by Elope. Specifically, they make a crown that is nearly identical to this crown (minus the few rhinestones shown on this hat), but it reverses to a frog with tiny crown upon its head!!In our house, hats go a long way toward imaginative play, and with a few accessories (like sword, cape, scarf, wand, etc.), these become our halloween costumes, carnival costumes, and easy-to-pack activities to occupy us while traveling."
1,More New Trilogy Crapola!,Yet another stupid character from Episode II. George Lucas should be ashamed for ruining the Star Wars legend by putting out cut-rate trash like Episode I and II.
2,Kinda boring,"I am sure that it is very hard to follow the success of Frustration Plantation, but Oh Perilous World really misses the mark. The songs are supposedly pulled from real-life head lines, but they are hard to follow lyrically and the melodies are just kind of dull. There are two CDs, but the second is almost all skits with only two or three songs on it. I am sure that I would have eventually purchased this album even if I knew all this before hand since Rasputina is my favorite band, but only to add to my collection rather than actively listen to."
2,"Temporary relief, but that's all","We used several of these (about 1.5X the package recommendation for our size home), and bathed the dogs twice with Ovitrol shampoo by the same company. Fleas vanished...for about ten days; a little short of the ""30 weeks protection"" claimed. Appears we're going to have to bite the bullet and bring in professionals."
2,Properly Ordered Words but Thin,"Just didn't work. Instead, read Kafka, Beckett, Borges, anybody with soul and adult concerns. There is something silly and insulting about the use of Ohio, as if name dropping a place in the Midwest is enough to give the stories depth."
3,A bit too much of traditional country,"""Blue earth"" is the most country inspired album by Jayhawks. Although it's a good debut (?), things got better for the second release: ""Hollywood town hall"" and the third one: ""Tomorrow the green grass"". On these albums I think Jayhawks got the right mix of country and rock. Although ""Blue earth"" clearly shows the talent of especially Mark Olson and Gary Louris, I think it has too much of Gram Parsons in it, too much of traditional country. ""Blue earth"" is in my opinion very similar to The Byrds ""Sweetheart of the rodeo"" from 1969. I miss the edge and I believe too many of the songs are predictable and not too far from the Nashville sound. But of course there are highlights included, and a song like ""Will I be married"" is absolutely comparable to Jayhawks better tunes.The thing is that this album (like many others) gets better with repeated listenings, and what first appeared as nothing special turned out to be rather good after all."
2,rainy day music and tomorrow the green grass are better,i loved tomorrow the green grass and have rainy day music in my cd player right now. this seems to be an effort to capitalize on the recent success of rainy day music by dragging some old stuff out and re-packaging it for new jayhawks fans. its just not their best effort.
5,Mirette on the High Wire,"I enjoyed reading this children's novel very much. I liked the unique subject and the author's creative and innovative ideas. The author did an extremely good job illustrating some of the difficulties with walking on a high wire. In addition, the novel had an important morale, never give up. A must read for everyone!"
3,The Hire Wire Girl,This is a good book because it tells you to believe in yourself and don't give up. The main characters are Mirette and Mr. Bellini. You just want to know what Mirette is up to. Mr. Bellini just helps her out.She practices outside on the clothesline. Mr. Bellini was there and then left. He came back and saw her on the clothesline.Mr. Bellini thought of an idea to show her that he's not afraid. She comes up there with him. They both do the hire wire together.
4,Kohler Not a bad facucet. A litttle over priced though.,"This faucet works well and looks fine, but is not worth over 2 hundred bucks. The finish has no coating on it to make it smooth but is a little rough. Not too much, but you can feel the brushed finish. I guess things have changed from my 20 yr. old faucets where the finishes were nice & slick. Otherwise the product works as described.Would be a great buy for a little over a hundred bucks."
2,not very interesting,"I bought the book in the hopes of getting a good story about Methos in Ancient Egypt, but instead all I found was a typical story suited to a romance novel and not to an adventure in the Highlander universe. The ending and the discovery of Methos' immortality and the reaction of the Egyptian was trite, simplistic and shows a horrible lack of orginality. The book also managed to work in the typical 'kill the woman he loves so there'll be no hindrance and he can have more adventures' (This was used in countless James Bond movies). The Macleod/Methos relationship was also one dimensional. Macleod does the boyscout routine and Methos does his 'Do nothing and leave' routine. There is no true interaction between the two and they are left as cardboard cutouts. Ms Sherman could have done so much more."
2,does not capture the characters,"I vastly preferred the Methos/MacLeod sections (a regrettably small portion of the novel), despite the lack of rapport between the characters and the strange stiltedness of MacLeod, because at least it had a plot with good pacing and intrigue. Unfortunately, the bulk of the novel centers on Methos in ancient Egypt, where the plot drags, the secondary characters are made of cardboard, and Methos himself is much too noble to be true. Best read in 20-minute increments."
2,Methos is the coolest immortal,"I really hate to be critical of a book that is centered around my favorite Highlander character, but this book is not that good. Very little time is spent in the present which causes the relationship between Methos and Duncan to seem flat and one dimensional. The flashbacks to ancient Egypt are somewhat interesting but I felt that the characterization of Methos in the past was, for the most part, inaccurate. But if you're a diehard Methos fan, go ahead and read the book anyway. Just don't expect anything spectacular."
4,Love and The Way of the Heart,"This is one of the earlier books by Adi Da and it provides a very useful adjunct towards an understanding of the ""Way of the Heart"" as an essential meditative technique towards the attainment of Enlightenment. Strongly Recommended.The Journey To Enlightenment"
5,Worms,I've played Worms at my friend's house this game was awsome! This game has a great multiplayer mode that will keep you entertained for hours. If I was you I'd buy this game as sone as i had the chance.
5,"GOLDDIGGER, RONNIE BAKER BROOKS","POWERFUL! IN INDIANAPOLIS, I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO CATCH RBB LIVE AT THE SLIPPERY NOODLE INN. SINCE THEN, I HAVE EAGERLY AWAITED THE FIRST RELEASE FROM THIS EXTREMELY TALENTED GENTLEMAN! NO DOUBT DESTINED TO BE A LEGEND LIKE HIS DAD, HIS RANGE OF VOCALS AND GUITAR ARE INCREDIBLE. THIS MAN PLAYS GUITAR LIKE NO OTHER! HE'S DONE AN AMAZING JOB COMPILING ALL THE BLUES LEGENDS THAT HE MUST HAVE LOOKED UP TO GROWING UP, INTO A SMOOTH AND UNIQUE SOUND ALL HIS OWN. FROM STEVIE RAY TO JOHN LEE HOOKER, RBB'S GOT IT ALL! OF COURSE TEAMING UP WITH HIS DAD ON ""MAKE THESE BLUES SURVIVE"" REALLY TOPPED OFF AN ALLREADY GREAT ALBUM! FROM THE BLUESEY ""STUCK ON STUPID"" TO A ROCKIN ""MUST'VE BEEN BOUGHT""THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYBODY'S MUSIC COLLECTION. SO RARE TO BUY AN ALBUM AND REALLY ENJOY EVERY TRACK!"
4,THE CHILD DEVIANT,A Much better album than I anticipated. Excelent electronic music that beats hard and combines modern industrial with modern synth pop to a entertaining effect. There are plenty of underground dance hits on this record that make the album worth the gamble for online buyers. Fans of VnV Nation and Dismantled will not be dissapointed.
3,This was okay,This CD was okay. I think the other reviewers are friends of the band. They've definitely got a good deal of potential though! Good luck!
5,I love that Honeywell still makes these.,"I went from fearing that I would have pay a plumber hundreds of dollars to replace my zone valves to feeling like I was “getting away with something,” by paying only $25 a valve to get all three zones working perfectly again! Very easy to install."
3,book on cats,"this book is outdated. Material is good for its day, and should be read for the history, but not for current trends or prices."
2,Search for the Shadowman,If you like mysteries and even if you dont then the Search for the Shadowman is for you! I have never liked mysteries i always thought like wow it is that person they always make them so obvious. But in this book it was great. This book was about a boy named Andy researching on his family history for a school project. After he is told not to Andy does it anyways. What did he do though? He wasnt supposed to research on his relative Coley Joe Bonner but he did any ways to find out who really killed him! This was one of the more interesting mysteries. Joan Lowery Nixon wrote many other books and since the Search for the Shadowman was so interesting i am going to go find one of her other books!Joan Lowery Nixon is the best author ever!
5,"Blonde on Blonde, Born to Run, The Band, Bulk","Comprable to the great works of Bob Dylan, The Band, Bruce Springsteen, Muddy Waters, and Hank Williams,Sr. I've heard ""Female Jesus"" about 10,000 times and I still listened to the sample. Buy this and you'll thank me later."
5,American songwriting at its best,"This album is an unpolished gem that continually reminds me of what is of lasting importance in music. And that is honest, intelligent, thought-provoking songwriting and performing. If you like downbeat rock music, witty and personal lyric writing and low-fi production you can't do better than this album. Listen to some songs like Female Jesus, Chloroform, Shrunken Head, Town Crier elsewhere (YouTube?) if you need to hear samples. If you like those you will want to own this entire album."
1,cute but the enamel comes off,"I'd love to find a dining kit that looks just like this one but is made somewhere other than China (USA maybe?) and that has an enamel coating that doesn't self-destruct.Over the course of two- count 'em, 2- camping trips, the enamel on all bowls and mugs developed chips and began peeling.The flatware didn't come apart but is made of cheap bendy metal so you have to be careful not to break it.I ended up with a functional useful flatware pouch, bendy flatware and some plates for the cost of the Dining Kit- I'm sure someone out there would consider that a good deal but I do not."
4,Great Value,"I think this is a decent set - especially for the price. The only complaint I have is that the dinner plates are small. Due to the outer rim, the eating surface area would not fit a big juicy BBQ T-bone steak! So ended up purchasing some larger plates just for those situations. I really like the fold up silverware case."
3,Red speckled campware,"Several camp dinnerware items were defective. The item was fine, but overpriced for what you get."
1,Plates Chiped,In concept it is a great set for a family of four. Unfortunately the coating was chipping off some of the plates/cups. Returning for refund.
1,Very poor enamel finish and the utensils are plastic,Very poor enamel finish and the utensils are plastic (not enamel like the GSI brand).Had to send back. expect more from a Coleman item.Amazon refunded the items so that made the experience easy on the wallet.
2,cheap,you would think something with the Coleman name would be a little higher quality. Made in China. How about making in the USA??
2,"Description ""Like New"" but DEFECTIVE","Used items listed as ""Like New"" should not have blobs of paint and chips on pieces of the set! Returned."
5,Almost perfect,"I wasn't sure that I would find any use for this dining kit, but wanted something in Tanzania to take on picnics to wonderful spots. So, got this set. The only thing I wish was that they had a cute container of some sort, but the flatwear is in a cute windup case so no losses there. But, the rest of the kit is really nice. It won't break, it cleans easily, you can see it in the grass and dirt, and everything is a good size. Just the ticket for picnics. Coleman definitely knows what they are doing. Now they need to make it with a traveling case for the whole thing."
1,Not so hot,"I returned this. I am giving this product 1 star because I liked the silverware that came with it. I was really disappointed in the enamel ware. On several pieces, after a single use, the enamel popped off and the bare metal was exposed. This shouldn't happen. Coleman needs to look at the source that is making these in China and maybe think about bringing them back to the USA. I would gladly pay double for these if they were as good as they used to be."
3,Chips easily,"When I received the set, one of the cups was gouged and had chips in the paint all around the rim, where you would drink. The box the set came in was busted open, yet still placed into a box to ship and sent to me. I know it wasn't damaged during shipping because that box was perfectly fine. Will be working on hopefully exchanging this item."
1,After reading the reviews I will this this again but,"Tried making this pizza crust but it just never got off the ground. I mixxed it in my bread machine and when I dumped it out it was too runnny to work with. Sticky dough on the floured board, sticky dough on my hands, sticky dough still in the bread machine pan. (Runny dough too). I added more gf flour, at least 6 times totaling over 2 cups and then gave up. We have been spoiled by Kinnickinnicks premade pizza crusts. I will try the Arrowhead mix 1 more but what a nightmare!"
2,not happy,controller was broken returned and ordered another but the same problem The fire button on the back would get stuck and not work.Would rather get a xbox 360 controller.
1,Doesn't Fit Stiletto 2!,This item is too big to fit the Stiletto 2 and it's side holes don't match up to the power and hold buttons. This item should not appear on amazon pages when people shop for a Stiletto 2!
1,Case for STILETTO 2 past review,After reading a past review I purchased the case. Unfortunately the case is too large to work with the Stiletto 2 thus it is worthless as far as Im concerned. I have now idea how the reviewer used it with his Stiletto 2 with out stuffing it.
3,Great Speaker - I also got a damaged product from Amazon!,So I'm pretty sure I got the same broken speaker as another reviewer had that he said he sent back to Amazon. Mine had a broken tweeter post so the tweeters were just hanging on by the wires. No joke. I bet he sent his back when it was broken and they put it right back up for sale on the website...so yes I sent mine back so beware as you might be buying it up again. It's like passing around the Old Maid. I bought a new one from another seller (not Amazon). Good Luck! Great sound quality by the way!
4,A Must for Musicians!,"I would highly recommend this book for any serious musician who wishes to delve into the relatively unknown realm of twentieth-century piano music. David Burge provides a thorough and interesting read full of fascinating bits of information and historical context. The accompanying cd is a special bonus. Occasionally the writing turns very opinionated or biased, however this is a small distraction in an otherwise excellent resource."
4,Great for collectors but be warned,"This combines Asia's 'Live in Moscow' with John Wetton's third solo album proper 'Arkangel'. I had another copy of the live album already, which i sold. I didn't have downloading capacity yet, so I bought this for the solo album as well; also because I like imports. A couple tracks from each album has been removed, which I don't think was necessary, even though I had to get the original editions so I could have the missing tracks. Also, Steve Howe is pictured in the booklet, even though he doesn't play a note on either disc. You get what you pay for. This is more for completists. Otherwise, it's better like your kid's toys when they're ""each sold separately""!"
2,Almost silent.,"This fountain was beautiful to look at, generous in size, but practically silent. I love the sound of trickling water, so this had to go back."
5,Excellent in every way,A morning and evening collection of verses around a central theme. I like it because it is well thought out. And I can be quickly edified while I'm waiting for the morning coffee to kick in so I can have my regular quiet time. :-)
3,Kindle Edition needs reworking.,"Unfortunately, the Kindle edition seems to have been rushed a bit. The Table of Contents links to months, but then you have to swipe/flip to the date. Also, there is no pagination, so all entries run together rather than starting a new day's entry on a new page.I really hope Crossway will update this edition so that after linking to the month, you then link to the specific date; and with pagination so that each entry starts on a new page."
2,Print not as readable as my older version with blue and white cover.,"I have used this devotional for years--it is my favorite! However, I do not like this newer printing as it is more difficult to read. I much prefer the earlier printing with the blue and white cover. I will try to find that one when I need more copies--even if they are used!"
4,For The Wheelman In Everyone,"Driver is sure to go down as a classic in the Playstation library. It puts Grand Theft Auto to shame. Anyone who's ever watched car chases in movies such as French Connection, Bullit, and the Driver should buy this now. Okay, so the plot and video sequences are underpar. Big deal, what makes this game great is the control and the fun factor. When you are speeding up a San Francisco hill and fly right over top of another car, you will thank me for recommending this game. The director mode is my favorite. You can save your replays and direct your own high octane car chase. The classic 70's cars range from a Buick, a Nova, a Cadillac, and many others. Trust me, go out and buy this game now. It took me over 20 trys to beat the last level."
4,"Finally, a driving game I enjoy!","After buying every racing/driving game on the market since the introduction of the Playstation (and taking them all back after being disappointed in some fashion or another), I finally have found a driving game that I enjoy! This game plays with the same feel as Grand Theft Auto, except with the graphics of Destruction Derby. A lethal combination of fun and a never ending shelf-life. Unlike many of the ""popular"" driving games, this one actually gives your car damamge when you hit something. Finally, a driving game that has more than just ""true driving physics""; it is actually realistic. It's about time someone figured it out..."
5,You can't stop playing!,"Man this was the best driving game i've ever played.I mean,yes this game was the bomb! If you don't have a memory card you better get one. Even if you beat it, you should find the codes and play all the stages again with them. the only thing that I might change is the driving test at the beginning. I had to ask my friend how to do some of the moves.Other wise you should buy it."
4,you are the wheelman,"this game is really fun to play.i could play this for along time.i cant emphasize how much this game is fun.i played it for along time,then i got bored with it, doing the same things, driving around crashing.it got boring.but that was after along time, maybe i just played it out.this is definetly a must have for you car crash game freaks."
5,This game rocks!,"Not a racing game, but a totally different experience. You drive around entire cities with the freedom to go whereever you want. Different missions, storylines, cities, cars and styles of play. You may be the getaway driver for a hold up or moving a hot cars across town or you can just cruise around the city if you want. Try it first to see if it's your style. If so, you'll buy it for sure."
5,A Lot of Fun !,"I've tried many different driving games, but I have to say that this is one of the best. I enjoy all the 4 cities, and since I have been to each one, it's fun to try and find landmarks there. The police chases are a blast. They never give up, and the harder you try, the more they try. The graphics are not the best when compared to the latest games, but you are so busy having fun it is hard to notice. The plot is not the best, but this game is for those who want to drive fast and have fun. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Buckle Your Seat Belts Kids!,"This... My Friends, Is One Fun Game! I Loooooooooooooove It! I Used To Play It Into The Ground, No Joke Mine Fell Apart. :( The Best Part Is ""Going For A Drive"" Cuz There Is No Time Limit Or Objective, You Can Do What You Want And Try To Stay Out Of Trouble, But I Cant Help But Speed Past Cops So I Can Put On A Chase!!! Weeeee! I Almost Fell Out Of My Chair When I Read There Was Other Driver Games! I Cant Believe I Missed Out On The Fun!"
2,Racism is NOT fun!,"Ok, this is good game in the gameplay part, driving around trying to accomplish your goals (though I don't condone the Fox TV-like glorification of escaping from law enforcement officers), but I returned this game after one to many of the inbetween scenes. How much making fun of minorities can you stand? I thought this kind of humor was better left to Borchtbelt comedians from the '50's. Hopefully the sequels will rectify this mistake. An apology would be nice too."
5,Beast Game Boy Game Ever!,"I remember when i saw this game in a store and i all ways wanted to get it but i had no money. So i had to sell 4 playstation games 1 game boy game 2 computer games to get it. ...i got mad until i got Duke Nukem for game boy. When i played it it was money well spent cool graphics and cool colors. And when i saw there was blood i forgot i was playing on a game boy.Cool weapons a shotgun,machine gun,stun gun,grenade launcher,rocket launcher and a flame thrower. Just wait till you get to level 2 you'll melt with joy when you get the chain gun one big s.o.b ha ha ha.And theres 36 or more enemies.21 levels of killing.You get to ride in a army tank and a rocket ship.This is not like duke3d for the computer its like Duke 1 and 2 but is still cool.i remember when duke3d came out in 1986 my step dad was a tester so he got a beta version. I hope this helped you. bye."
2,Compaq ASE Falls Short of Objectives,I agree with the other reviews of this book. It was published at a time where Compaq was switching between the old tests and the updated tests. The Compaq ASE book was written before the Proliant 8000 and 8500 eight way systems were released. It was also written with speculation on Windows 2000. Those of you who are planning your ASE right now will notice that the second test (Windows NT Integration) has been renamed to Windows 2000 Integration and covers the different versions of 2000 and such.You can not complete the ASE sequence with this book alone. Fortunately for me my partner attended the classes so I have used his coursebooks for the updated information and have passed the first two tests. We'll see how the third one goes next week.
1,Don't bother,"This book covers maybe 70% of the Systems Technolgy Exam, 50% of the NT Intergration Exam and 50% of the Systems Management Exam. Syngress and the author's should be embrassed to have this book still on the market. I was better off buying the Exam Preps from Boson. Don't waste your time read the useless information contained between the covers of this book. I have made the decision not to use any of the Syngress books for any future certifications that I am pursuing."
1,I would have preferrred 942 blank pages.,Because at least I could have used it as a notebook at a later time. I feel sorry for the trees that had to be chopped down to provide the paper used in this book. This material is as useless a bicycle with square tires. This book is an embarrassment to Syngress what a complete waste of money. Do not buy this book under any circumstances. This book got a rating of 1 because I could not go any lower
3,Don't let this guide be your only guide,"I agree with the two other reviews- this book gives a good framework, but you will need more details in your studies."
5,Great puzzle for kids,"My 3 year old son loves Thomas and Friends so this is a great puzzle for him. The different ""time of day"" light/dark are good for helping him to learn the difference and helps him to complete the puzzle."
5,"Fun, durable puzzle!","My boys have loved playing with this puzzle. The pieces are durable and fit together easily. My 2.5 year old is able to do this puzzle on his own, and gets so excited when he finishes it - even though he's done it numerous times now. The picture is clear and the moving clock hands add to the fun. I'll definitely buy other Ravensburger puzzles."
3,solid info but...,"I perused this book at my campus bookstore, and liked what bits and pieces I read, so I ordered it through Amazon. This book is very informative, with solid information on the theologians presented...but the 1st chapter of the book is on Karl Barth, a good place to start with regards to chronology, but the author of the first chapter, in attempting to summarize the depth that is Barth's Church Dogmatics, only succeeded in presenting a confusing rabble of half-explanations with slight brushstrokes of worthwhile analogy and pedagogy. As a result, I'm scarcely into the 2nd chapter...the first simply exhausted me. Thus, I suggest using this book more as reference tool for individual theologians assertions...not as a read through familiarizer per-se."
3,Not as glossy,Purchased this after I ran out of the OEM paint halfway through painting my 1987 Black Max. This paint is correct in color but does not have quite the glossy finish that the factory paint has. It would work fine for inboard/outboard engine or inboard engine applications but not for matching the finish on an outboard motor cowl.
1,Small and Pretty to Look at BUT CAN'T USE IT!!!,"This ice bucket is beautiful and although on the smaller size, would have fit my needs...had I been able to open the darn thing!! I should have trusted the other poor reviews about the functionality of this product."
3,Snowball Candles,"I was disappointed when I opened these because the quality has gone down a lot compared to the old one I have from the 80's. The new ones have a clearly visible mold line half way across the ball, like a mass-produced, cheap acrylic bead would. My old candle has no line whatsoever.Fortunately I purchased these as a gift for a friend who admired mine, and I don't believe she will notice this. She was extremely happy to get them. I wouldn't buy these new ones for myself because they seem sub-standard."
2,Poor Quality,"Don't let the beautiful picture fool you. This votive is very low quality. First of all the packaging is terrible. It comes in paper thin cardboard box no bigger than the votive itself, no protection whatsoever so you better hope it is packaged well and handled with care.The votive looks fine except for the ghastly mold lines traveling along the outside of it. It has a good size to it, a little bigger would have been nicer but its not like it is very small either. It really is disappointing because it really is a nice votive but the mold lines just ruin it. I had purchased this as a stocking stuffer gift but I may just return it to avoid the shame of giving such a low quality gift."
1,I come from L.A. myself,"I found this video to really blow. It is just another scam to market gangs to children. On top of that the movie was cheaply made, The person who said it looked like the Blair witch project was right. The people they interviewed were idiots as well. The gang members did not know that the heck they were talking about, the statistics in the video were completely exagerrated, EXAMPLE: during this (45 to 60 minute) film...koreans will make millions to selling alcohol, ANOTHER, 300 something kids will join a gang and get arrested in the next 48 hours. ANOTHER, ""there is over 300 crips and bloods gangs in L.A."" NOT TRUE...there is 199. and so on and so on. They complained about white people not giving them jobs because they had long hair. The inteviewed some guy in his house who was drunk and said ... every other word. Then on top of it they offer a Crips and Bloods T shirts and Hats!!!!! The only advice from a man out of The heart of South Central, DONT BUY THIS. IT'S PATHETIC."
1,Horrible!,"Don't waste your money,it went right in the trashcan! What a lousy product,didn't do a darn thing but DRY OUT my skin."
3,doria left a message,"an effective little thriller. nurse lucinda gale is hired by the matheny family to care for blair matheny,a brain damaged vietnam vet. the rich matheny family live in a secluded area of oregon. lucinda is accepted by the various family members and other hired employees but,slowly,it becomes clear,someone wants lucinda gone!...who is it and why? the author kept me guessing till the end. there WAS a dark secret but,it was not what i thought it was."
3,Works okay with good mounts- and some help!,"I've used a Nikon LS 2000 with a SF-200 for many years commercially. My first LS 2000 went back to Nikon about three times before they finally really fixed it- and they did as it's worked now for many years. The SF-200 needs help to work, though. We've found making the gate narrower with thin plastic- a leader card from my film processor- helps greatly in preventing the unit from pushing two slides into the scanner at once. The real issue is this older cardboard slides with bowed inner frames- they'll hook onto each other and cause jams. Inserting plastic between frames BEFORE they enter the scanner works, but does require constant intervention.BUT- still haven't found anything that works better."
4,don't be scared by horror stories,"Having read about all sorts of alterations (from switching springs to shaving off bits of plastic) that are required to get the SF-210 to function properly, I was expecting only headaches from it. Happily though, I've been through more than 1200 slides of the family archive so far (about 3600 to go) while it is true that the slide feeder does occasionally jam, I have found that it is very much a function of the age of the slides. Slides less than 20-25 years old scan without a problem. I'm often able do 50 or so (about the max which fits in the feeder tray) without a single jam. On older slides (dating to the 50s and 60s), I do have some jamming problems but they are still the exception rather than the rule. Bottom line---if you are tackling the job of archiving all the old family photos, this is a must have and it works much better than many of the reviews would lead you to believe."
2,Went back to my Minolta AF-2840,"The problems with jamming are insurmountable. I went back to the Minolta DiMage Scan Dual III, AF-2840 (bought on eBay for about 150, years ago), which can scan 4 slides at a time and never jams. The quality is brilliant, but you have to work in batches of four."
2,Took too long to receive,"I haven't used this yet, but the seller took almost a month to get this too me. Good thing I was not in a rush!"
4,mmm...cheesecake,"The information contained within the box was not translated to English and is hysterical to read.Otherwise, this is a great pan. It compares well to others ans I like having the stick out handles for easier removal from the stove."
4,Mini cheesecake pan from Amazon,"Not real crazy about the bottoms being seperate on each cup, I know I will end up loosing one or more. Not sure where to store the individual bottoms so I can remember where they are verses where you keep pans. They are little 2"" or smaller flat disks - loose one and you can't use that cup. Poor design feature."
4,Great pan - so many uses,I have had this pan for 2 years and use it at least once a month. I make mini cheesecakes and mini muffins in it. I have another pan just like it that is about 5 years old and the quality of it is better (it is heavier and thicker). This pan still works great and creates adorable mini desserts
5,Where have you been all my life,"I love, love, love this pan. I saw Paula Dean use one on one of her shows and have been looking for it ever since. I finally found it on Amazon. I have since purchased 2 more and even the mini pan. I have tested it and the non-stick coating is really non-stick. The bottom lifts up the ""treat"" does not stick at all. WARNING--you must wait until the pan is cool. I burned my fingers the frist time because I was so anxious to see if it ""worked""."
5,Norpro 3919 mini cheesecake pan,"I purchased the Norpro mini cheesecake pan it;s very nice, I've only used it one time but really like it."
5,Best Mini cheesecakes,When I first ordered these I wasn't too sure how well they would work & if they would stick. My mini cheesecakes came out perfect & I actually ordered more. I love that the cakes don't stick & they are so easy to keep clean.
2,Did not provide me with what I needed,Information is dated by the time it is published. Market trends change so rapidly and regions vary so dramatically that this was not very helpful to me. I can see where it can be a helpful tool - but was a waste for what I needed.
5,WiggleMania,"I bought ""The Wiggles-Getting Strong for my 18 month old granddaughter for Easter and now I'm #1 Nana. She loves it and now knows all the songs in order already!"
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this one. At the start of the series, they go and rip off a western story that has been done countless times before. They should have been trying to establish something unique at this point, trying to prove they were original. Instead, they did the opposite."
1,Not the real thing.,"I used to love the original Nautica for women. It had a fresh, aquatic smell, with a splash of florals intermixed. It was a very sexy fragrance, appropriate for the young and young at heart. Then, unfortunately, they quit making the fragrance for sale in stores.When I found this product, I was excited and ordered a bottle as soon as I could, thinking that it was the same fragrance that I had once loved. Unfortunately, it is not. This is a knock-off on the real fragrance, plain and simple. This perfume smells heavily of powder and some florals, but the powder smell is very strong. There are no aquatic notes as there were with the original, and the resulting fragrance is really not something I would expect a younger person to enjoy. I am returning my bottle."
3,Keep Your Wife Happy,"This is an inexpensive and decent perfume that will help keep your wife happy. Of course, there is nothing worse than a wife who bothers you all the time. They tend to complain about wanting more money and all that-- get to be a real pain. Buy yourself less annoyance."
1,Drudgery,"I wouldn't give the book even one star, if there were a ""no stars"" category. Reading it is sheer drudgery. I'm a quick reader and very fond of true crime, so plowing through it for two weeks was quite unusual and quite unsatisfying. There are few facts - instead, lots of ""if"", ""maybe"", ""perhaps"", and ""might"" - the author has built an air castle on his own conjecture. Finally I just checked the back of the book for the verdict (normally verboten) and threw it away. What a total waste of money and time! I'm going to be allergic to the name Carlton Smith from now on. Too bad he shares the first name of a good true-crime writer!"
4,Cicada,"Today I am quite sad as this cassette finally broke after 8 years of service. I bought it when my son was born on this day (his birthday is today). I was out walking on our country roads feeling highly energized as that is what this music does for you. I was remembering how when he was two years old he used to beg me to find the ""bells"" song and he would listen to it over and over again. Wouldn't that have been a lot easier with a CD? Sometimes I feel as if I am being swept away in relaxation by the flute which has a Japanese lilt and other times I am charging along by a kind of celtic quality. I think this is a gifted and versatle musician and I highly recommend it (NOT JUST FOR YOUR BABY)."
5,Traditional English Bridle,"I am extremely please with the quick delivery. Two days after ordering this bridle I got an email stating it had been shipped and then received it the very next day! The leather is very supple upon opening the package but still feels like that new, tough leather as I attached the bit and reins. The fit is great for my horse, a standard Thoroughbred and I dealt with no troubles with having to punch extra holes, etc. My only concern is after playing with the bridle in my hands, I started to get some black residue from the dye and in the holes I can easily see the brown leather beneath. Hopefully with some time it will wear in. Very basic design, traditional, however it gets the work done without being flashy. I will use it for everyday riding as well as in the dressage show arena and perhaps take it with me to event."
3,It works,"In very used condition but it works and as a gift, my GF is pleased and still plays it to this day, its obviously hard to find now a days but thanks to the user and amazon they made life easy for me, thank you."
3,A little strange at first....,At first the video was a little strange for me with the chants and the fast breathing....but after a couple of times I have learned to like it and feel like it is a worthy work out.
2,Not my style,"I'm fairly new to the Yoga scene and I was looking for a more fast paced yoga that still stretched me a lot. It was fast paced enough, but I found it odd. I didn't like the rapid movements and felt very awkward in several positions. It could just be I don't like this style of yoga since this my only experience with kundalini. Over all though, I did get a good workout.Along with not liking the workout style, the graphics are very poor. It looks like the background is a green screen and I do not like the choice of music at all."
5,Fat free yoga with ana brett & ravi sing If standard YOGA bores you then get this!,"I have almost every one of the Ana & Ravi programs and love them all, but this one is one of my favorites, and I highly recommend it to beginners to start with! Its FUN!!! It has 4 sets you can do individually, or do the whole thing which I often do. The sets have fun names like FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE, and START YOUR ENGINES, NO IMPACT AEROBICS, & YOUR LIFE IS IN YOUR OWN GLANDS. This type of yoga is just GENIOUS FOR WEIGHTLOSS since it works internally and externally to make some real and lasting changes. Can't say enough about this, or any of Ravi/Anas workouts!Thanks,EVE"
1,Don't waste your time,I don't know what everyone else was talking about when they wrote their reviews because this video was terrible. Sooooo boring. It's just breathing exercises...half the time you're just watching the girl pant like a dog. I would not recommend it at all
5,energising,"This exercise dvd is fun and gives great results and exercises the mind and spirit as well as the body. I have lost a few pounds and feel great. It lifts the mood and gives a sense of revitalisation and optimism. The moves are simple but quite hard work but Ravi is encouraging in a low key way so it is easy to persevere. The moves stimulate the glands , organs and metabolism, a great over all workout."
5,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!",Finally the long awaited updated Fat Free Yoga! And it was worth the wait. It will take me awhile before I can do the entire DVD. Right now I just do one of the four 20 minute sets and it is enough. I am hoping it will help me drop the 15 pounds that my doctor has recomended that I loose.I have just been diagnosed with pre-diabetes and needed to start an exercise program. This DVD seems to be the right one.I am so happy I found Ravi & Ana and am on Amazon right now to buy their Beginners and Beyond DVD.
5,Everything a Yoga Workout for Losing Weight Should Be,"I've tried a couple yoga DVD's and I have gotten way more results from this one than any others. It's challenging but everything is doable. I was a little sore the first few times I did the whole thing, but there is a matrix which lets you do just one or 2 of the segments at a time. Most yoga workouts aimed at losing weight throw some hand weights into the mix, they miss the real essence of what needs to happen for one to really get in shape. This one has segments to spike the meatablosim, reduce the core, raise the heartrate, balance the glands, and soothe the emotions.Evertyhing is explained and you get to hear what each exercise does for you but you never have to sit through lengthey discussions, they keep you busy the whole time. Out of any workout I have ever done, I would say this is my favorite."
4,breath review,"i found the inhaling easy to understand. however since there are several types of breathing, they weren't clear enough. also the exhaling, are you supposed to exhale through the diaphragm with your nose closed or through puckered lips?another issue i had was that i read Q & A addressed to Ana & Ravi addressed by a catholic who didn't feel comfortable with the chanting. she wanted to know if it was religious based. Ana and Ravi tried to avoid the issue and just answered that the writer should just be religious about doing the exercise, and the names chanted is actually an Indian deity - which means yes the chanting originates from Indian religion. there is no need to beat around the bush. they should provide the true facts."
1,Totally Lame,"I believed the reviews raving about this video. I thought it might be a nice little variation of my routine.It took too long to get started doing anything. I can't imagine what good the fire breathing technique could do for you. It just seems kooky. The narrator is unseen and spooky and the chick doing the exercise is freaky with her smug little smirk. I will never use this CD, what a waste of money.I will stick with my favorites, flow yoga, cardio and weightlifting."
1,Don't waste you money on this one,"I am so bummed I thought I would write a review of this dvd- something I would not take the time to do unless I really hate it, and I do. It has hardly any stretching and is not at all challenging. If you're a dude and like to stare at a really fit lady doing stupid-looking moves (like sitting and flapping her elbows ""like a bird"" while breathing like she's doing something difficult like running) you might find this mildly entertaining. If you're seriously looking for a yoga workout, this is not the dvd to buy."
1,A HUGE disappointment,"I bought this video to add some variety to my workout routine, which usually includes ashtanga yoga (Brian Kest's power yoga is great) and pilates. After reading the other reviews on this site, I thought this DVD would be a good workout but found it sorely lacking. It's really a complete yoga practice, with lots of meditation and breathing exercises, and not a workout video at all. So fine if that's what you're looking for, but if you want a vigourous workout this is not the video for you. I didn't find I exerted any energy, nor did I feel loose or strong at the end of it, which I always do after ashtanga yoga and pilates. ""Fat free yoga"" is a misnomer, as there's no way I burned any fat doing it, and though this may seem superficial, the pigtails Ana Brett was wearing (she must be at least 40) were more than a little ridiculous and as such were rather distracting."
2,strange,I bought this DVD intending to take my yoga practice to a new level and as something I could take with me when I travel for work. This is an odd workout. I found it paced oddly and kind of annoying.
2,"Fascinating in its creepiness, dizzying in its method","You may find that watching this you feel the urge to laugh even as your skin starts to crawl. That's not just the probability that you are probably hyperventilating due to the breathing and movement combination but the fact that, well, these teachers are a tad creepy.Every time I try this DVD I start to feel sick even though I am in good shape, have been doing yoga for several years and have a pretty good breath support system from being a trained singer. I was quite surprised by the physical reaction I had to this program, actually. It doesn't feel like a workout either (other than that you are breathing hard in a hysteria sort of way) although Ana doesn't seem to have any fat on her at all. So she must be doing something.Perhaps her waifish figure and LSD-esque persona is due to the distinct possibility that she was once abducted by aliens."
2,Say goodbye to traditional poses,"I hated this DVD. I felt ridiculous the entire time. I've been to yoga class before and I was expecting the down dog, eagle pose, whatnot. Apparently Kundalini yoga is completely different. I guess I like the standard poses. This seemed like a lot of sitting around and breathing, when what I really wanted to do was a lot of stretching."
4,Loved the meditation at the end,"I did this DVD this morning and I really wanted to like it. Maybe it will grow on me. I don't see how you can lose weight on this, as I barely broke a sweat. The only exercise that was hard were the yoga push-ups. If done correctly, you really feel it. Otherwise, I loved the meditation at the end. Ravi asks you to feel sadness, fear and anger and then sing Sa Ta Na Ma after each emotion is concentrated on. This one made me cry, which never happened before while doing a kundalini meditation. I really like that Ravi and Ana have taken the time to teach these meditations on their new DVD's. This alone will keep them in my daily yoga rotation. I gave it a four because weight loss--I don't think so. Feeling good---you bet!"
4,Excellent Entry Point for Beginners,"This is an excellent entry point for beginners looking to try Kundalini. While very effective, there are more modified poses, especially in regard in the core work, than some of the other practices by RaviAna. You can do the entire 90-minute practice or use the matrix to create a shorter practice. The teapot meditation alone is worth the price of the DVD. I will frequently use the matrix option to have the teapot meditation loop several times because it is so soothing and easy to do. ""Your Life Is In Your Glands"" is my favorite on the DVD, although all the segments are wonderful, because I feel this area of my body is so important and needs to be worked on regularly."
5,Rescued My Thyroid,"Many of the reviews mention how this type of yoga, and this DVD especially, work so well on the glands. It seems that many people who have had a low or over active thyroid have found relief through this DVD. I was dubious to say the least. Doctors will tell you, and they told me, that after a certain point your thyroid stops producing hormones and after that it's pretty much down hill, unless you take a thyroid supplement, but that can be dicey as well. After doing this DVD more or less for 2-3x per week for 3 months, I am sleeping better and I don't feel fatigued all day. My hair is in much better shape, and my skin has more elasticity and is less dry. My energy levels stay stable throughout the day. I'm very grateful for this DVD and I'm going to keep doing it indefinitely."
5,Fit well,These overs fit well a d were easy to put on my RV's wheels. They are made of heavy plastic. I expect them to last for several years.
5,Classic heel covers,We needed something to cover our trailers wheels when parked in our yard and these will do well. We are pleased with this product.
1,One Time Zone,"I bought this watch (TIMEX WOMEN'S WATCH/T5G341) to help me when I went to Europe where I would be traveling through several time zones. It did not perform. It is difficult to set to any other zone than the one which was on it when I bought it (NYC). When I went to re-check what the description said where I bought it, I could not find anything which resembled this watch or had any model or style model which I had expected to find on either my invoice or the watch itself. Watch out for fake watches. This one makes me feel as if I have been taken to the cleaners - but only for $35. sigh. I just happened to stumble across the fact that I had bought it though Amazon and was able to check my order history to find it again. Good luck finding a decent women's radio controlled watch. I can't."
1,Watch didn't work,This watch didn't work. The company did issue me a USPS mailing label so that I could return it. I sure was disappointed. Looks like a good watch when they work.
5,Great Pick For Girls!,"This must be Purple Moon's greatest CDrom. It has girls in a lighthouse who need help with problems about their life, family, and friends. With each girl there's a world with little scenes of them, and different adventures, and puzzles you have to solve.The way I'm explaining it may sound confusing, but I love this computer game and think all girls should have this, too.Oh, and once you've gone through one of the girls' world, you make a necklace and then a story appears with a moral behind it, waiting to be found.Have FUN!"
1,Need something more,Too slow paced. Didn't feel like I was doing any kind of Yoga or exercise that was beneficial in any way. She's very soothing but going for a walk is better than this video.
3,Laura,"I'm a workout video junkie, and am always looking for new workouts to try. Since I've been pregnant I've haven't really found any videos that I've been completely thrilled about - mostly because they are so slow paced and drawn out. I've done non-pregnancy workouts of Tracey's and found them to be good, so I had high hopes for this one. All in all its good - but not one that will get your heart pumping like a good brisk walk will. Its more for stretching and for days when you aren't up to moving very fast. The workout is also done in what appears to be Tracey's home - which wasn't what I was expecting either. But there is a section called Partner Stretches, where her husband (a physical therapist) comes in and demonstrates stretches that are done with someone else which is a nice bonus."
5,Review,"Written with the outmost immaculate precision, Peterson's version of ""The Lesser Key of Solomon the King"" earns itself the main role behind the curtains of magik.Having read most of Peterson's works, this one doesn't fail to impress.Be weary when entering this book as a passionate new student. Following the strict, outlined rules WILL bring success. An induction like the ""Intervarsity"" will bring failure."
5,This edition puts all others to shame.,Peterson's is the only version of The Lesser Key (Lemegeton) with both scholarly integrity and magical viability.
1,Over priced,While this has a few gems of good advice it's far too short and it lacks substance. I wish I had been aware of this before I spent $6.50 on it. If the preview had been one page longer it would have helped significantly.
3,okay game not my favorite in the series but still fun!,well the storyline is somewhat mediocre the controls are well unforgiveble another is leon is such a an idiot he does not have what it takes to be a cop claire is just well a ditzher voice when she talks is just well annoyingbut the graphics are what carries this game through they are well ahead of it's time the zombies look real and so do the umbrellacorporation mutations thank god they took out the hunters in this game i got sick of them after awhilethe weapons are pretty koolthe magnum is devestating as usualbut as for replay value i will not play this again
4,"Cool, But Too Easy!","This game is cool! But, there is a flaw, IT'S TOO EASY! There is no challenge because there is not enough zombies, the game goes like this.... find 1 or 2 zombies, put a few bullets in their heads, and boom, they're dead. I liked the parts where there are more than 2 zombies, it gives me a challenge and there is more blood than you would usually see. But great game, great story, not enough zombies."
2,Tall tale on a silly trail,"Yeah, I agree with the other reviewers that the film has some nice photography and color. But the dialog... sheesh! Hollywood types have never been able to nail the ""mountain-folk"" dialect, even if they had a decent script. And Henry Fonda (even a very young one) playing second to Fred MacMurray is a deal breaker. The premise is sound: industrial progress competing with family blood feud to disturb the otherwise tranquil beauty of the Appalachian mountains. Would have been better as a romance, rather than a cheap fist fight. I guess I was expecting something closer to the quality of Spencer's Mountain. If you liked The Waltons, maybe this one's for you."
2,It's Alright!,"I was very disappointed with this CD. As a hard core Stevie Nicks fan, I couldn't see wasting my money on this one. If you have Timepeace and/or Enchanted, why buy this when all these songs are already on the other compilations. Don't waste your money if you have Stevie's greatest hits CD already."
3,Been There...Heard It...,"Stevie Nicks is one of the BEST Female vocalists around and I am a BIG collector of her music....but if you are a collector or even a Stevie fan...you should already have all these tracks on other easy to find albums. Usually, you would think they would put at least one or two unreleased songs that are hard to get on a CD like this one....it is THEN I think this CD would be worth purchasing. I fear the only reasons to purchase this CD is for the CD cover or if your a major collector who must have EVERYTHING of her. I probably will buy this but its best just to keep it sealed. Stevie..you RULE baby!!! ;)"
1,This is not a good collection of Stevie Nicks' works,"This does not reflect the in depth and true artistry of Stevie Nicks. I think they should have have dug up a couple of ""well done"" unreleased songs...or better yet some ""well done"" live versions of songs that have not been over exploited...like Garbo or Sleeping Angel...these are very intense songs, reflecting her artistry and I would love to hear them live. Also an extended live version of Gold Dust Woman would be totally awsome. I'm sure there's plenty of songs hanging 'round Stevies piano bench in Phoenix waiting to be recorded. I'm not saying the songs chosen are bad, in fact some would do well being re-released on such a compilation, but some...well, just shouldn't be on this album."
5,Nice,It is a gift for my friend and he says it is a really good article for him. This book is nearly new.
1,not as described,Received three dvd set. Two of them were same. Couldn't contact seller so filed a claim. I shoulda read this stores reviews first an I wouldn't have ordered
4,Live Yes plus Solo tunes,"So its not really ""The Yes Story"" but thats OK. Open Your Eyes is of course the title track from their 1997 album and this is the original version. The other four Yes tunes are taken from recent live DVDs. I don't care for Anderson's disco version of Owner of a Lonely Heart.Steve Howe's two Dylan tunes with vocals by Anderson and Annie Haslam are pretty good. Jemma Wakeman's song is a modern country tune. The two Squire/Sherwood songs are pretty good and sound like Yes. Wakeman's Journey and Merlin are updated versions without orchestra, choir or narration. I was hoping for the original Journey but this version is good and the singer here is better than the original.Howe's acoustic version of To Be Over from Relayer is nice. The sound quality is good and the packaging is nice. There is no musician or source info."
4,STEP RIGHT UP!,"As a mission statement, ""Welcome to the Freak Room"" certainly makes it's point. There's just the right amount of classic prog schtick, and the influence of ""new classic"" prog acts abounds. Stellar guitar and keyboard work form the backbone of this record, whilst the somewhat tentative yet engaging vocals suck the listener in. As a debut, this cannot be faulted. This reviewer is reminded of The Flower Kings through the vocals and the easy sense of humour present in the arrangements. Shadow Circus tread the fine line between complex and accessible with ease - melodic hooks fly in from left and right, coupled with more than a few ""WOW"" moments. The album benefits from above average production, with some wonderful guitar sounds and crisp clear drums.All in all, a storming debut. Let's hope this lot knock out the overblown double-disc concept album we all know they've got in them. I can't wait to hear the singer let rip."
4,Used but respected books are appreciated.,"The copy of Human Sexuality in a World of Diversity that I recieved is in wonderful shape, even though you can tell it was a well used book. The pages are unbent beyond the normal corner wear, and the pages are highlighted in a light color only. While I prefer to have books that are not written in, it is understandible that college materials will have some writing. So I do appreciate the fact that the previous owner of the book used a light yellow highlighter, and only highlighted topic areas rather than full paragraphs. This book is a very educational, and fun to read book. The information is easy to understand, easy to relate to, and easy to visualize as you read. I have become a fan of Nevid and Rathus books, and I hope that I will be able to use similar books, in content and condition, as the one I am using now. Thank you for sending me a high quality book."
2,ONE ONE HOLE FOR CHARGER & EAR PIECE?,"I got this pink razr phone a while back and I was NOT informed that the charger plug is the same as the ear piece plug which means that you can not charge and talk while using an ear piece. This annoys me sooo much because I use my ear piece exclusively to talk and now when I get into the car or am at home, I can not charge and talk with an ear piece at the same time.The speaker phone is not clear. When I drive and forget my earpiece at home, I have to use speaker phone and it doesn't work that well. I have to put it next to my ear. What's the point of that when it's suppose to be used ""hands free"". When the police pull me over, what am I going to say to him, ""Sir, I'm on speaker phone.""That's about as much as I want to say about this phone. It's not that spectacular."
1,Poor sound quality,I had this phone for over 6 months before tossing it out due to poor sound quality. I could not hear and others could not hear me. My sister has the same problem with hers. The poorest quality phone I've ever purchased.Much better quality phones are available for a lot less money.
1,never buy,I got this phone a little over a year ago april 07 and boy did i hate it i went thourgh three razors. The keypad is cheessey and it freezes in a middle of a call or sending a text message i constantly haded to take out the battery and put it back in. The battery life stunk i would leave it on all night and it would be dead the next moring so i finally upgraded to the lg env and it is the best.WARING:NEVER BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!!
2,Don't buy this phone!,"I have had my razr since January of this year. I loved the phone at first, it has great reception and clear sound. However a few months ago it started having problems charging. It says unauthorized charger...it is the one that came with the phone! I have to fight with it every night to charge and sometimes it doesn't. Luckily mine has pretty good battery life. The only time the battery dies quickly is when I am in an area that has no reception because the phone roams and searches for signal non-stop. Navigation is extremely slow; I push a button and wait a few seconds before the screen changes...SO annoying! I am getting a new phone this week, I have had enough."
5,Wonderful CD,"Really great cd. I'm a big fan of period music, and this one really hits the mark. Check out his other music collections as well. You won't be disappointed."
4,Robin Jones Gunn Strikes Again!,"I read the Christy Miller series when I was in Junior High, grade 6 to be exact, and I loved them! They really fastened me in my walk with Christ and encouraged me to pursue God's best for me. When Robin JOnes Gunn came out with the College Years I was so excited. This last book, ""I Promise"", gives us all what we've been waiting for through our years and experiences with Todd and Christy. This book, and this series, has given me so much insight on life, relationships, and such. I highly reccommend this book! And I really hope the Robin Jones Gunn will continue writing more about Christy and Todd and their friends! God has gifted her!"
4,A good Book,My 13 year old daughter read this series. She really enjoyed all of them including this book. I would recommend it for teenage girls.
5,South Africa at its best,"Ipi Tombi was a musical show that toured the world way back in the sixties. In those days the apartheid regime in South Africa was in full control, but the group that formed the cast were given permission to tour.The show has a very loose story line, and it is not necessary to know it, in order to be able to enjoy the music. Vibrant rhythm, great voices and great variety are the hallmarks of this excellent recording. This music indicates clearly the roots of modern music. The title number, Ipi Tombi and the song The Warrior are particularly good.Any collection of ethnic music would be enhanced by this soundtrack."
1,couldn't get it to fit,"I bought 3 of these for people @ work. We couldn't get it to fit. The adjustment mechanism was very difficult to work--one adjustment was too big, the next one too small. NOT happy."
2,Disappointing,"Although I can hear some interesting aspects to this, it pales to insignificance when I listen back to his '70's innovations. the excellent 'Floating Music'- Island Records (1972) with his Close to the Edge band,and the follow up'Freedom is Frightening' with his band 'East Wind' - Island Records (1973) It's a shame these aren't available on CD presently; but if they ever are, be sure to snap them up."
4,This helps...,My 5 year old daughter loooves books but gets frustrated trying to learn to read herself. I have been buying all kinds of books and games and anything else I can find to make this process more enjoyable for her. Enter Thinkfun!! I bought this along with Zingo Sight Words and she has a blast playing them. She keeps learning more words every day!! She's now sounding them and writing them out herself and is getting more confident trying to read.
5,Fun if you make up your own rules,"I play this game with my 4 1/2 yr old and 6 year old. We have fun, making up our own rules. It is great for early readers. They certainly are better at reading the words, rather than forming them. They just need an adult to play with them. When they form words and read them back, they are so proud of themselves! This is a great way to practice reading/spelling without them knowing they are learning! They love the little tiles and the plastic dealer."
2,For much older children.,"The age on my box says 5+. This game is for much older children or for very advanced 5 year olds. If you're looking for a learning resource to teach younger children to read, then this might be good for you. If you're looking for a fun game to play with your child, don't buy this game; you'll be disappointed."
3,Love my coffee,Great product. Milk is nice and foamy. I love having my coffee in the morning. I would of liked it to be microwave safe. I prefer my frothered milk to be warm.
5,"Works, is fragile but be careful",Have had one for about five years. I have a stove top espresso maker and wanted cappuccino but did not want to deal with batteries.I use this at least once a week sometimes more. It can get messy and don't soak it as it will rust the parts holding the screen but not the screen but it it otherwise pretty easy to clean and use. I microwave the milk and place it on a silicone potholder as I use it and I think doing that has helped prevent breakage. I use it as well for hot chocolate. It really makes a difference in how the drinks taste and we like using it for coffee regularly.
2,glass breaks extremely easily and no warranty,This is a great device for steaming milk in the microwave and frothing it for a latte except for the fact you will need to replace the glass chamber about every two months at 15 to 20 dollars a pop. I love this device but when I called Bodum they would only give me a one time replacement chamber. They said there is no warranty and that the replacement chamber was for only the one time. It is easy enough to just put the steamed milk in a jar and shake it up.
4,"Looks Nice, Easy to Install","This hood shield was delivered very quickly (about 3 days before I thought it would be). I had it opened out of the box and installed on my truck in about 20 minutes or so. Very easy, and it looks very nice on my '04 Avalanche.The only think I don't like is the manufacture's sticker on the corner. There is also a small scratch in the plastic when I opened it up. It's not anything noticeable when driving, but if you look closely, you'd see it.Good product, and I'd recommend it."
5,Holy moly Macaroni,I bought the plane from wally world for 11.50It was a kewl little plane put together in a snap and all you gotta buy for a 1.15 is a cheap 9v battery from a dollar storenot to mention using a cheapy find adapter thats for an old answering machine. I used what I had took the planes home and all the stuff and was flying in about 1 hour. the battery needs tyo be charged more than once but more than 4 times will destroy the battery. Its a great plane for learning and yes it does take a beating I have flown my 3 planes thats right buy more than one if there cheap because replacement parts are hard to come by and so are the flight batteries that come included with each plane. Not to mention other wings. Also good plane for making scratch built rc boats and other scratch built planes. Well I said enough now go buy one and flt for yourself.
4,Idealist or Nacissist?,"I, too, am quite inspired by Mr.Kumar's tale of his life as a flowing stream, never resting in any place for very long. He has done a lot to help make the world a more peaceful and gentler place to live. But I wonder--what happened to his first wife, whom he says left him when he was unwilling to ""settle down"" and start a business? The dispassionate tone of the book--is it reflective of his personality, or the fact that English is not his native language? The pattern of moving around, rootlessness, and of not becoming very deeply involved with any of his co-workers and friends makes me question whether he drifted into the Green Movement as a convenient place to dwell, without really concerning himself with making a living or becoming too intimate with others.This does not in any way diminish the positive impact of his work, but as a biography, I am left wondering."
1,Fire Down Below,"Let's see...an undercover EPA agent roaming around the backwoods of Kentucky in a $4,000 leather coat? Yeah, that could happen. Usual Steven Seagal film...where phony ""coolness"" outweighs logic. At least there's a classic John Prine song over the end credits...and that's the only reason this movie even got one star."
2,Not Seagal's best moment,"Steven Seagal is a federal agent investigating the death of his fellow agent in a remote town. He disguised himself as a handy man, yes handy man with his pony tail and leather jacket. Sure he blends right in. It's not his worst movie though, personally I think his worst is ""The Patriot"". I gave this DVD 2 stars because of its excellent sound quality and good picture transfer."
3,overall a good movie that shows seagals more human side.,"It's a good movie Seagal shows a more human side in this film.I purchased the movie because i'm a big Seagal fan and i ended up liking the film very much.I think this is one of his best because it allows him to show an interest in something more than cracking heads.He shows a genuine interest in helping these people with a sort of story that you don't normally see in a Seagal film,an love interest.Seagal is never going to be given credit for his action movies and he certainly won't be given any credit for this film either but as an everyday person not a reviewer i think its a film worth seeing or even buying."
4,"really good, but not what i was looking for","hilarious as always, but not the dvd i was looking for. i really wanted more episodes and shows. but i would still buy this all over again. i own everything that's out there for ellen."
5,Good product,I like these over the heel strap type. My soles feel safer on the beach. They are less awkward to get on and to enter/exit the ocean. They were easier to use over longer fins and you can maneuver much easier. Especially in snorkeling.
4,$27.99 for everything I need,I have an old air conditioner that cools my tiny room fine but I have a feeling it consumes an obscene amount of electricity so I am very happy with this ionizer fan with its small footprint. I have often felt too hot in my room next to the kitchen in the winter with the heat turned off so I get to use this fan yearround instead of sweating in my room too embarassed to turn on the airconditioner in the winter.This tower fan is huge and has more options than I expected from something that cost $27.99. It also creates a wall of sound that insulates noises from outside the room including televisions.
2,Pass on this,"The Enviracaire Digital Tower Fan/Ionizer, even at this low price, really isn't worth buying. The fan is noisy and easy to tip over. The ionizer is messy and ineffective. These just don't work and waste electricity."
5,WOW!,"I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the Lord and is trying to make sense of what is going on in this world today. This book as the answers to the questions being asked over and over again in the news media -"" why did this happen?"" Well, if you truly want to know why evil things are happening, read this book. And if you don't want to believe what is in this book, you will forever keep asking ""why"" as the evil perpetuates. I'm not asking the ""why"" question anymore."
5,A wonderful gift for women,"YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES is one of the most inspiring and high interest books I've read in a long time. The author includes women's true experiences and transparently shares her own personal ""growth spurts"" as a Christian professional woman. Woven through the book is a well-researched historical overview of women's opportunities in our world. Very helpful in understanding personality traits.Great book to give to Christian women in lay ministries or any kind of leadership."
3,timers rarely work on modern window a/c units,"Note that these appliance timers rarely work on modern window a/c units.Most modern window a/c units have electronic controls (for example digital display of the temperature as oppose to just a dial).When power is cut to these units they will NOT re-start when the power comes back on - unless you manually turn the unit on. This is the case if there is a ten minute power outage in your neighborhood or if an appliance timer cuts the power to the unit for several hours while you are at work.Buyer beware .. before buying, at least test buy hitting the circuit breaker off, then on a few minutes later and see if your unit starts again."
4,240-volt A/C Timer,Great timer to control large residential air-conditioners.Wish there were more On/Off plastic tabs.The 2 tabs that comes with the timer allows only 1 On and 1 Off scheduling.
3,return purchase,I did have one that only worked 2 days and now I have to manually shut it off at times and not sure how to get any warrent
1,Did not work for me,"So i've bought the Intermatic 240V timer........in my case the time was not accurate, as when I set it Time and check a few hours later, I noticed some nasty delay ( 20 min per hour) , thus I tried it on different outlets in my home but with the same result. It's a shame as I can't give it any use.I must point out that the prong configuration adapter is way too hard to find at some reasonable price on Amazon ( NEMA 16-20A which is a rare US configuration)thus very impractical for getting plugged any hypothetical working device and even more if you live outside de US like myself...Useless piece of junk"
1,Expired Milk,We ordered this to make it easier to travel with our toddler. This is the end of July. The milk expired at the beginning of APRIL. That's almost 4 months ago. Forget buying this from Shoplet unless you don't care whether or not it's in usable condition.
5,my favorite book in recent memory,Adam Voith's book is as touching as it is funny. Do yourself a favor and read this book.
3,Decent swimsuit for training,"A decent swimsuit to go from treadmill to pool. Would have liked more supportive inner lining, but the suit does a nice job."
1,Does NOT fit colt .22 mag like it says,I have a 1911 colt .22 pistol and this loader does NOT fit over the magazine. The magazine is just slightly to big for the loader.
2,"Getting better, an improvement on the last book","The writing here is tighter, and the plot is better. I liked the part about Tirla the best. I hope she has the best of luck!The second part I liked was about Dortea playing the grandmother role. The funniest part was where she telepathically fusses at Sascha over the bill that Tirla has acquired over new clothing for herself. *grins*Thumbs up for Daffyd. Who is better suited, ethically speaking, to the role as director for the parapsychic institute.Not quite as good as the others, but better than TRP."
5,Great for blind hunting,"This heater kept my hands warm in 20 degree weather. My hands always get cold, and I was sitting in a blind for a few hours with thin gloves. This let me warm up my hands without having to start a fire and scare everything away. It makes a slight noise (the propane flowing out), but the doe that walked by didn't seem to notice anything.In an open space, it won't keep you hot, but it will do enough--and is worth every penny."
4,Second Edition,"While the CD arrived promptly and in good shape, I would have liked to have been alerted to the fact that this was a re-issue by BMG and not the original pressing by Conifer itself, made in England, which I was trying to replace."
2,Needs some improvement,"We bought this to replace an old one we lost in a move .. It NEEDS to be screwed to the wall. We were so tierd of seeing it on the floor and since we are Getty ready to sell, didn't want to put additional holes in the wall.Our other one was screwed as well but we were looking for a less permanent option. I guess there is none. Other than that the cat Loves rubbing against it!"
2,Doesn't stick to the wall,How do I get this thing to stick to the wall? The little adhesive pads that came with it wouldn't even hold a feather to the wall let alone this heavy plastic groomer! I'm thinking either duct tape or sending it back :(
2,Difficult to mount; cats don't care about it.,"They might as well not include the sticky mounting pads - they held it up for around a minute and a half before unsticking from the plastic. I drilled screws through it to mount it to the wall but then that causes the hanging nubbly part to bulge out and get knocked off if the cat rubs against it (which is the intention). This problem is kind of moot, though, as neither of my cats is remotely interested in it.The catnip that comes with it, though, is amazing."
5,how my package arrived,"I was very surprised to get this product so fast and it was in a sturdy envelope and the product was in excellent condition and I will remember your company's name so if I want to buy something else, I'll feel very comfortable knowing that it will come from you. Thank you for you speedy service and the excellent condition that it came in. I gave you five stars. Thank you, Shelley Prague"
4,"Not As Pictured, But Still A Good Product","My unit did not come with the padded grip, just bare metal, but the tool seems to be decent quality and I would purchase this brand again."
1,get folked,"One reviewer compared this to Great Lakes. That's ridiculous. It's like comparing the Beatles and the Bay City Rollers. Great Lakes has variety, intelligence, inventiveness; Masters of the H has only mournful dirges. This is FOLK MUSIC. If you like Peter, Paul, and Mary, or the Kingston Trio, you will like this. I don't; and I don't. Be forewarned."
5,Woman of Grace,"At first you wonder about the main character and how the author will make this book not the run of the mill ""Lady of the Night"" changes her ways and finds love. The development of the characters and the their transformations makes it worth the while and I also liked how the characters of book 1 remain as part of the story. How the characters grow closer to Christ through experiences and the characterization of reading their thoughts, has the reader pulling for them. Have already bought book 3 and plan on reading more of hers."
4,Life's journey,Enjoyed how life's journey is filed with struggles but with the Grace from God Blessings happen. Life is what you make it.
5,Great Book,Was so happy to find out there were more books.Can not put it down once I pick it up.I will give as a gift to all my friends.
4,"Culdee Creek, book 2",Easy to read. It is a good romance novel. Interesting reading about how they might have lived during that time period.
5,Excellent!,I have read this book many times and never get tired of it. Kathleen Morgan is my favorite author. She has a way of making you feel like a part of the story by drawing you in. All of her books are HIGHLY recommended.
1,Have not Read yet,I have not read this book yet. I'm sure it will be awsome. The other Two books have been awsome so I asume that this book will be awsume too.
5,"women of grace, brides of culdee creek",Wonderful follow up to book one. I like the way the story shows GOD's love and mercy. Couldn't wait to start on the next book.
5,Woman of Grace Book 2,"I am a series reader of the old west. I loved Kathleen Morgan's first two book in this series. I will be reading all of her books and will continue to enjoy the Christian aspect of living in those long ago days.It's really nice to read a book without blushing or skipping over words you don't normally say. I am one of those women.I love classic historical romances set in this time period, the old west. When a writer pulls you into a book and you become that character, then you have a good book as far as I'm concerned. This one is one such book.I recommend it for any historical fiction fans. Beautiful characters and a lovely story."
3,"Fun until you hit ""The Impoossible Forest of Re-Spawning Enemy""","This game is pretty good until you have to cross through a forest to end this level (you'll know it when you get there). At this point the game just bites. I am a pretty good gamer but have been trying for hours to get through this area. It's insane, they surround you and keep spawning! Whoever designed this level is a jerk. Expecting people to handle unlimited spawning by using smoke grenades and perfect aiming on targets they can barely see is just a jerk, plain and simple."
3,They blew it,"This game could have been--SHOULD have been perfect. COD 2 was so close and they only forgot one thing--cooperative play, specifically via split screen. Why any developer would not add a split screen co-op is beyond me, especially when these guys received some SERIOUS negative feedback for not including it on their last game. So did they listen? No, so very sadly, they ignored their customers. So Call of Duty 3 is a solid game that fell short because these guys didn't feel that customer feedback was important."
2,It's like playing cod2 all over.,"I am an fps fan from way back. I enjoyed cod 1 & 2. cod3 feels like a retread to me. I would buy it again and play it again, but basically it is hard to become immersed in the suspense because it is so un-original. It is ""okay."" Just do not get your hopes up."
4,COD3 This is an overall excellent experience,"Call of Duty 3 is an overall excellent experience from my pov regarding the single player campaign. I don't have LIVE as of yet. But the intensity is very exciting, and extremely visceral. Along with the graphics and the sound it just makes for a very realistic gaming experience which I thoroughly enjoyed."
2,"Carly, did you run out of steam?","I'm a huge fan of Carly Phillips' work... But I've come to the conclusion that by the time she gets to the third book in each of her series' she's just too tired to flesh our her work and make it shine like everything else she writes...I had trouble even getting into Simply Sensual, let alone finishing it, and that is not the case for any other Phillips book I've ever read. The plot was dull, the characters were flat and there was nothing gripping to keep the reader pushing through the novel. The only reason I finished it is because I had read the other two books in the series and I felt I should see it through to the end.For anyone out there looking for a good read... DON'T LOOK HERE! Try Phillips' other novels or go elsewhere entirely. Simply Sensual was ""simply"" a waste of time!"
1,"defective, twice","I own a BA Recepter radio, love it for clean sound and superior tuner sensitivity (pulls in FM from 50 miles away), wanted to play CDs from a table unit, so went to BA CD Microsystem despite Reviews that warned of CD unreliability. First unit from J&R would not play CDs, ejected them with Error E-4. Called BA, who confirmed unit as defective. J&R replaced quickly at no cost. Second unit took in CD, gave out Error E-4 and would not eject the CD. No more for me; I just bought a Tivoli/Kloss instead..."
2,"Excellent Sound, but CD Player Did not Work","The unit's radio sounded fabulous, but Boston Acoustics clearly has a quality control problem. Imagine my disappointment on Christmas morning when after shelling out $500 for a system for my girlfriend, it wouldn't play CD's. They would look like they were playing but no sound came out of the unit.When you buy the best and pay top dollar, you expect to receive something that works out of the box."
2,Boston v. Bose,"This product's sound system for CDs produces much better sound than its Bose counterpart. However, I did not purchase it for that purpose but rather for what I thought was its ""HD Radio"" feature. Unfortunately, it does not have an HD radio, and the model I received did not even contain a long FM antenna - therefore no FM radio is available to play. I will never buy this type of product again via the internet."
4,excellent disc,"Trinity College choir has a gorgeous sound. This CD is excellent for relaxing to. The more ""forceful"" pieces left a bit to be desired - not as ""big"" as they could have been. However, the loveliness of Barber ""Agnus Dei"" makes up for it. Good work from one of the handful of mixed-voice English collegiate choirs!"
4,Does the Job,A gift for my wife. It works. I gave it to her for her birthday. No issues with it. --Norm
5,The Alphabet of Sheep,"This is the most lovely rug hooking book I've ever seen. They photos are more like paintings, the detail superb; I use it as a 'coffee table' book since even those folks who visit may not be rug-hookers they thoroughly enjoy looking through it. So sad we have lost a talented and most artistic individual."
3,Creationist Children's Dinosaur book,"This unique book tries to explain dinosaurs to children from the Creationist point of view. Now set aside your beliefs for a moment, whether pro- or anti-Creationism, and let us consider the book as a book.This work includes many nice drawings of the classic dinosaurs, such as Tyro Rex and Triceratops. It finishes up with an imaginative discursion on the Bombadier Beetle and how it can explain the literal existence of fire-breathing dragons.Wow! Fire-breathing dragons in a science book! Whether you consider this book to be Literal Truth or Science Fiction, it's a fun read with nicely drawn pictures."
3,Great subject,"Not much more than the TV ads that sold it. Yet it was entertaining. Ali's talent as a quick witted persona is displayed as much as his poweress in the ring--both displayed well in Ali Rap. I'd like to recommend this especially for young people who start like off behind an 8 ball. Those who didn't know the glory of The Greatest need to. I'm yet honored to have lived during a time that I watch him happen--first in the ring and then in the world. He got a message through about being black, being human well being Ali that meant as much as any speech maker in history and reached those who needed it the most."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,"My three year old grandson loves Thomas the Tank and all his friends. When I found this entire collection, I immediately purchased it for delivery to his home. When he came to visit at Christmas, the book had to come also. I loved it - he loves it - his parents love it. What a great buy for a Thomas fan. He actually laid in the floor for an hour looking at this book without someone having to read to him; however, when it is time for reading, he almost always requests this book."
5,Well written book,Our Grandson especially one loves everything Thomas. The books were in good shape all but one. It had a broken spine and smelled terrible of cigerrets. We kept that one here and had to buy another one to replace it.
3,could be more powerful,"Tried this fan this past wkend; I had to put it fairly close to my face (about a foot) to feel any air.I'll keep it; it's better than nothing. But, wish it had a little more oomph.I stuck my hand in it to see if the blades stopped, or would hurt me. There is no way anyone could get hurt. The foam blades stop immediately.Just wonder how long the batteries will last. Anyone know?"
4,Good battery-powered fan,"This fan is excellent for a battery-powered fan. Very powerful compared to other battery models; it will put out enough air to keep you confortable several feet of the fan. It is obviously not as powerful as an AC-powered room fan, but great for what it is. I haven't tested battery lifespan yet (I bought it after Katrina for future hurricane-related power outages), so no opinion there yet."
1,Very disappointing,"I really wanted to like this fan. The rubber blades are perfect for preventing injury in a cramped tent. But there are many problems with this fan.1) The circular part has arms that simply plug into the base; so the fan can flop backwards and end up facing the ceiling instead of facing you. There's no way to lock it in place or tighten the grip of these arms.2) When packing the fan in a bag, the circular section will definitely come off (i.e. the arms will detach), and when this happens, the only thing holding the fan part to the base is a thin electrical cord, which will obviously break if any strain is put it on it. So this is NOT designed to be thrown in a bag, which makes no sense for a camping fan!3) I swear this thing eats batteries like they were candy. There has to be another battery powered fan that doesn't kill 4 Ds immediately."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"Very cheaply made product. Took it on a recent very hot 7-day camping trip. The first night-and-a-half, it was a blessing as it was the difference between sleeping and not sleeping in a hot tent. But then it just quit working in the middle of the night. Replaced batteries, but no luck, and very little sleep for the rest of the week. I normally only buy premium products so that I don't have these type of headaches, but just couldn't find a higher quality unit."
3,"OK, not great","The fan works well, but not great. Being battery powered I expected it it to be a little weak. The blades seem to turn quickly enough, but they are too small to create much air movement. If you stand right up close it works, but get more than 2-3 feet away and you can't feel a thing"
3,Nice fan,"This fan was pretty much what I expected out of a battery operated fan. It did not provide much cooling, but did help circulate the air. I used it during the hottest part of the summer upper 90s during the days with lots of humidity. It was a good way to circulate air, but it did not do much more than that."
2,too weak,"very portable but I can't really feel any air coming out of it unless I hold it right to my face and even than it is weak, it is not practical."
2,stopped working after 2 hours,"i had high hopes for this fan, but like many other reviewers here, mine stopped working about 2 hours after i turned it on. i replaced the batteries and the problem persisted. i can get the fan to run now if i smack it (like an old tube tv) but it doesn't run at full-power and is very erratic. i'm going to crack it open to see if there's a loose connection or something, but i shouldn't have to do that. i can't recommend this product."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! IT FELL APART!!,I was so excited about being able to have a fan when we went car camping last weekend but as we unpacked & setting up; I turned on the fan & the blade spinned right off!!! It wouldn't spin very fast after that & it wouldn't stay on. I'm going to attempt to return it but if I don't get to return it; I'll just chalk it up for experience.
5,Muy Bueno,me llego bien buena presentacion no me dio ningun problema para utilizarloExcelnte altamente re co men da do ok
3,Not enough air for Florida,"I got this fan because it was at a reasonable price and many people claimed even in the summer time this fan worked wonders and was sturdy.I only bought one, so that might be the reason, but I don't even notice it's there besides the noise it makes. If I place my face directly in front of it I can feel a nice, small breeze, but other than that it doesn't exactly produce air. Of course, I live in Florida where the only temperature we know is hot, so maybe it works better in a cooler state, I won't knock it till I try it."
4,Love this fan,"I couldn't help but feel a little sissy when I bought this, but it really was nice to have on warm sunny mornings in the tent. I placed it up on a crate and it really helped keep the air moving and me sleep comfortably as well. I think everyone should have one."
5,Wonderful,"This fan is everything I could have wanted. It is so, so quiet. I use at work. Moves ""alot"" of air, even on low. I have only placed one set of batteries so far. Seem to be very easy on batteries."
1,To noisy to sleep,"Too noisy to sleep. Shaft holding fan blade in motor was very loose causing a loud rattle. Will contact Coleman for a resolution. Size and portability was good,air volume was good and price was decent."
1,Didn't work long,Got this fan for a camping trip that I was taking and it worked great for the two hours that it worked.
1,Broken from the start,Unfortunately we waited to use the fan at the camp site. We placed brand new batteries in the fan and nothing happened. It was broken when it arrived and we really took a chance since we had read a review where this happened to someone else. We were disappointed and I have to send it back.
4,I wonder if I could be that brave???,"I truly enjoyed this book. The beginning is brutal and grips you with total force!!!! Thruout this book I kept on asking myself~ Could I do what these 2 kids did to escape from these crazy blood lusting killers? The pace is fast, the ending throws you off but leaves you with a satisfied feeling. I would definetly reccommend this book, except if you are faint of heart, Laymon is not your author!!!!!!"
5,FIRSTLAYMONNOVEL,"Aside from all the famous archetypal monsters that pure-blooded horror fans have come to know and love, this book nearly has it all. The only downfall is that it doesn't shine as a startleing literary acheivement. But few horror novelists over the corse of history have ever reached that kind of mark. This book is a very easy read. When I say easy, I mean that you could probably finish it in one sitting, if you could get passed all the gore and the enchanting sadism of our antagonist. The least I can say is that this book is not for the faint of heart, or anyone who agrees that there should be strict obcenity laws to prevent this sort of thing from falling into the hands of the uninitiated. If you like Stephen King, but get tired of the mulri-layered plots, if you want a good and fast-paced read and are a devoted fan of this forsaken genre, READ THIS BOOK NOW....But not before you go to bed."
4,maybe not for everone accept richard laymon fans/horror fans,"the book starts out like one of those teen slasher horror moives. It reminded me of that. the plot centers around surviveing vitims jody and a little brother of an non servieing victim and one of the killers named simon. Simon is given the task of getting jody and the boy or else! but simon wants to get his hands on jody for other reasons. Jody is describe as a fox, a nice looking young girl so take a hint. The book is not everones interests I am sure unless you are a big richard laymon fan and or horror thriller fan but because of the sexual type plot of the book it may not interests those fans ether. There is also a section about guns and thier use for self defense that may also turn some readers off as well."
4,A very good translation of a classic!,"Great Expectations is easily my favorite of the Dickens classics. With that being said, normally when you translate a book into a movie, something is lost in the shuffle. Mobile Masterpiece Theater has done a marvelous job, though capturing the heart of the tale.Iaon Gruffuddd, of A&E's spectacular Horatio Hornblower series, does a good job as an adult Pip, however in his days working as Joe's apprentice I did not really feel that he adequately conveyed Pip's disatisfaction at being there very well or appearing embarrassed once he does come into his fortune and Joe visits.Joe, on the other hand, is portrayed perfectly, as is Pip's aunt Miss Havisham and Estella. The plot is followed accurately, though at a breakneck speed, which causes the story to feel a bit rushed. All in all, though, it is a fairly good interpretation that anyone who enjoys the story would do well to pick up."
3,My expectations were groundless,"I bought this DVD to see a very true interpretation of my favorite Dickens' novel. The movie itself is special and makes the wonderful mood. But this DVD contains the advertising - the big emblem which appeares every 15 minutes in the right bottom corner of your screen. It overlaps the picture and what is worse - you can't dip into the motion. It appeares twelve times all throughout the movie and is always very disturbing. I felt that I spent my money not well, because of this stupid interupting advertising. I was disappointed. But in the rest of things it is a wonderful movie."
4,Great Expectations Amazes,I enjoyed this movie very much. After just finishing the novel I bought this movie. I was really happy to see how close they stayed to the actual book. Most other movies take advantage of it. This is a must! The camera work done in the film is also really great. I especially loved the way that they ended it. Ioan is fabulous and Charlotte shines as Miss.Havisham. Orlick was amazing!! In fact everything about this movie was!A VERY VERY MUST!!!
4,Great adaptation of a classic,Great Expectations is my favourite Dickens book and this production doesn't disappoint. Ioan Gruffudd is terrific as Pip and it's such a change to have Miss Havisham not be a dotty old crone. Charlotte Rampling is still a very beautiful woman and she is excellent as Miss Havisham. Justine Waddell is suitably cold as Estella and the rest of the cast is fine.The only complaint I have is that this was too short and tended to go over some parts too quickly. For a more thorough adaption I recommend the 1991 mini-series with Anthony Hopkins.
3,paper shredder,"I bought this for my small office--under 14 employees. I like the quantity of paper it will accept; however, since it is not a cross-cut or confetti cut shredder, the shredded paper is long & bulky. It fills up the bag too quickly I the machine won't run if the bag is too full. Overall, it is a good machine."
3,Realism Not Top Of Toperoff's List,"Of course writing a work of fiction about the life of a very real human being, especially when that human being is James Dean, is not an easy task. It can't please everybody. There are fabrications and outright lies but then that's why it falls under the heading of fiction. I liked a lot of aspects of this book but if you're a newfound Dean fan don't let this be the first book you read about him."
3,It's a quick read,"I would love Sidney Sheldon's books if he would take his time in writing more in depth of the characters and stuff. However, I did enjoy this book ~~ it's not my typical read anymore ~~ as I've read his books in high school. I haven't read this one and the mystery surrounding the three doctors at a big San Francisco hospital is a gripping read.Dr. Paige Taylor, an ambitious heart surgeon wanna-be is accused of murder when she inherited a million dollars. Dr. Kat Turner and Dr. Honey Taft are filled with secrets of their own. While Paige fights for her life in court, the story spins unraveling the secrets of events that happened the previous year ~~ and the reader gets a closer glimpse of Paige and her roommates.Looking for an exciting read with murder, suspense and mystery and romance? This book has it all! Despite the gritty writing, it is an enthralling read. I couldn't put the book down after a few chapters ~~ I just had to know what happened!1-17-02"
5,A brilliant novel from a brilliant writer......,"An unputdownable book about 3 doctors' struggles andaspirations, achievements and downfalls, Nothing LastsForever is Sheldon's greatest one yet. With exceptionallyplausible characters, the intriguing story races from O.R.'sto courtrooms. Once again the author proves to be in a classof his own."
5,a separate place,"it was lovely. tranquil, serene, everything I expected. it would make a wonderful gift for the stressed out person in your life."
3,"Very accurate, but bad tab","The transcriptions in this book are 100% dead on, they play exactly like the CD, which is great if thats what you are looking for. However, they have one huge flaw in them.Many of the songs use a capo. The tab has the chords in both the key you are playing in, and the relative capo key, which is great. However, the tab is written as if you do not have a capo.For example, the first chord in ""youve got a friend"" is an A, but because of the capo at the second fret, you play a G. This would normally give you tab that had a 3 on the lowest string, to play the G note, however, you are really on the 5th fret because of the capo. The tab has a 5, instead of the more intuitive 3. This makes it very difficult to play, because you have to constantly transpose the notes as you are playing."
3,Doesn't seem to explain flow control very well,"Im writing a file transfer program to transfer data over the serial port using a NULL modem cable. This books helps a little. However, the explanations on P.54 about RTS/CTS hardware flow control I find quite confusing. The author seems to contradict himself. Other than that the book seems to explain other things descently and overall is an easy read."
5,They just get Deeper and Deeper....,"I've studied the progress of certain musical artists but, when it comes to a crew such as CM, non of it matters. these dudes bring it straight to your heart, God certainly has a vision set up for them, and for sure they are men of God whom follow his word. from Heaven's Mentality to today, The Cross Movement has came indept with words from that great book we all know of, and plunges it into your soul. from separate artists such as Flame or D.A. T.R.U.T.H. to, solo's from ppl of the crew such as Ambassador to Phanatik. These cats'll rock your soul from beginning to end with the blood annointment of Jesus."
3,Not deep,"This book has good Godly thoughts and has a biblical base, but it isn't very in depth. It has started some good conversations with our group, but we have had to create our own questions to make the study run more smoothly. If you are looking for a book that has actual application, this is probably not for you."
1,"Rubbish in parts, better in others","This book bored me if I am honest, it did not hit the spot like I expected it too. The plot jumped around far too much, to the point where I skipped sections and went back to the ""on board drama"" which in parts was also dull.I was disappointed"
1,POWER PROBLEM,"I bought two of these TV's in december, and after about a month they both shut off after a minute that they were turned on. If I leave them unplug for about two days they are back to normal for a day or two. which then the problem cycle starts all over again. The company right away says that their was a surge in the electric lines .how is that so when they play normal for two daYS.?????????????????????????????????"
1,Too expensive,"NOTE: This review only pertains to the price of this box set, not the show. Entourage gets 5 stars.However, this box set (combined seasons 1 and 2) is actually MORE expensive than purchasing each season separately. Box sets are supposed to save money, but that's not the case here. Save yourself $10 and buy each season separately."
2,Bland,"These people are funny... on their other movies. I think the target, folk music, is just inherently bland as a topic for a satire. Whatever the reason, this is nowhere near as funny as anything else done by these people. Stick to Spinal Tap, Best of Show, or Waiting for Guffman. The humor in this one, like Corky St. Claire's wife, Bonny, is nowhere to be found."
2,A Mighty Bore,"OK, how many times can this cast milk it? I love every one in this movie, but I couln't get past the fact that this cast has made three really similar movies in a row. I think someone that had never seen Waiting for Guffman or Dog Show would be disapointed. The material wasn't that strong, I couldn't watch the whole thing, maybe 40 minutes."
4,A Mighty Film,"Made for my sole enjoyment, I would give it 5 stars but I'm sure not everybody will get it. The ""Spinal Tap"" of 60's Folk scene, with the same brand of humour (and cast) as seen in other Christopher Guest vehicles (Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman). The soundtrack is superb, with original recordings of folk songs that emulate the period, masterfully done with wit, skill and love...just like the movie. Only negative comment is what was done to Harry Shearer's character at the end of the movie, a comedy twist aimed at the lowest common denominator."
5,Very subtle and very funny!,"Compared to WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and BEST IN SHOW, the humor in this mockumentary is a bit subtler. It is funnier every time I watch it, as I catch more of the wry, understated humor with each viewing. The songs are catchy, too. You really care about what develops with the central characters played by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara. This is a great comedy in keeping with Christopher Guest's other masterpieces! BUY IT!"
3,A little weird,"It was a little weird, but entertaining. I did enjoy the characters , and found some if the music quite catchy ."
2,Just Not Funny,I have seen all of Guest's previous works and have always split my sides laughing. This was not the case when I watched A Mighty Wind. There are too many characters and this fails to let viewers connect with them. Many other reviewers have mentioned the subtleness of the satirical elements of the plot but I just couldn't see it. The gags are too few and too far spaced. I could not wait for the ending when I had to put in Waiting for Guffman for a real comedy fix.
4,A Mighty Wind--funniest mocumentary since Spinal Tap,"I read a lot of reviews that say ""A Mighty Wind"" was funnier than or wasn't as funny as ""Waiting for Guffman"" or ""Best in Show,"" etc. I have a theory about that: these Christopher Guest & co. mocumentaries succeed or fail in a person's eyes to the degree that they have a connection with or knowledge of that which is being parodied. For example, I'm a musician, and I love Spinal Tap and Mighty Wind. Think they're hilarious. I don't know or care much about dog shows, and I thought Best of Show was the weakest. That being said, if you like music, or have any knowledge of folk music, you'll find this movie hilarious but at the same time a bit more poignant than usually expected from these parodies. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara's characters provide the emotion; everyone else backs up the comedy, my personal favorite being Mr. Guest and the Folksmen, with Mr. Guest's sheep bleating baritone. See this movie!"
5,Get the Guitars Out and Sing Along!,"""Hey....Wha Happon?"" The immortal words of a spunky folk music producer. ""A Mighty Wind"" is filled with a dementedly humorous take on folk music. Here we meet the love-hate duo Mick (who is not playing with a full deck of cards) and Mickey (Mick's old sweetheart whose husband sells catheters). We also meet the lollypop sugary New Main Street Singers, with the ex-porn star lead singer who worships ""color"". Then there is the folk-trio with a sexually ambigious singer. They all prep for ""An Ode to Irving"", a reunion of sorts in honor of their dead producer. Be a part of music history. See the meyhem. This mock-u-mentory is ideal for a chuckle. Well worth it."
3,Going down,"Not as funny as Best in Show, which wasn't as funny as Guffman. Levy was good, but not near as funny as Guest as Guffman. Parker Posey's character could have been played by anyone. The whole booking a venue thing was done countless times better in any Larry Sanders show."
1,No customer service,"This game failed to work right out of the box. It tells you to spin the wheel, but the spin button fails to work. When I tried to call the customer service number listed in the instructions, all I got was a busy signal, for days. I tried e-mail with no luck, and then the regular corporate number, which also was busy. DON'T BUY ANY IRWIN TOYS PRODUCTS. They don't support them."
1,One look and back it goes -,"Nice concept, bad execution. This doesn't look like it would make a clean cut through any type of cheese. I'd rather stick with a cheese knife than this ill-conceived guillotine. Back it goes before I use it even once."
4,love this little gadget,"[I admit, I just got this little treasure, but even with my limited use I think it's wonderful-to the point that I ordered one for my son/daughter in law. So far it it slicing like a dream. I have had the wire slicers before, and though they work well, the wires always go bad. I can't see where that is going to happen with this. And on top of it all you can put in the dishwaser for cleaning. Try that with the wood/wire slicer.The next thing that I will try is cucumbers and radishes. How about Leeks and small onions. I can think of a ton of uses for this little treasure[Try it-I love itMerleASIN:B0009VEO6Q MIU Stainless-Steel Steel Cheese Slicer]]"
1,Worthless Cheese Slicer,"I ordered this cheese slicer because it had a blade instead of a wire. I thought it would work better than the slicers with the cutting wires. However, it does not work well at all. When you try to slice through the cheese, hard or soft, the blade bends and does not cut through the cheese. Instead, it pushes the cheese aside and the blade hits the base. Totally dis-satisfied with this item."
2,Not what I expected,Looks good. Cleans up easily but blade bends and it will not cut a brick of cheese into uniform slices. Although a second blade was included with the order I hope it does not break often. I am still looking for a better cheese slicer.
2,Dissapointment,"I was very much looking forward to this book, but it was a major disappointment. I was expecting a piece of work of the same quality as the Ships of the Line calendar. Instead the renderings were muddy, poorly anti-aliased and lacking in any kind of dynamics. The renderings were further marred by being double-page spreads. To actually see the rendering properly you would have to break the spine of the book. Included with each entry is a pointlessly geeky wireframe model of the ship. The text is the one bright spot in this otherwise poor product. These guys are capable of much better work. I can only hope that in 2002, the long awaited Unseen Federation will be up to their previous quality levels."
3,Interesting Book,"This book has many important info about some interesting ships seen on the TV series. The graphics are good but are in double page, so sometimes you don't a good overall vision because the division of the pages."
3,"Smells great, doesn't last long!","I love the fragrance, but sadly it doesn't last long on me. It is gone in about 3 hours. I bought some Fracas lotion and that actually lasts a little longer but does nothing to increase the strength of the perfume.The fragrance is light and airy and beautifully sweet. The floral scent is wonderful, all those sweet smelling white flowers, jasmine, gardenia, and tuberose are what it reminds me of. I wish it would last longer."
5,A great series,"Another great book in the Bolitho series. A must-read for any fan of historical naval fiction, but start at the beginning! Twenty-seven books in the series, all very entetaining novels!"
5,Outstanding Device,"This preamp is something i was look for. Very warm tone, with high gain and no excessive noise. You can push in gain and get extremely low noise and very warm tone with it's nice preamp."
5,SPECTACULAR,"Living Landscapes: World's Most Beautiful PlacesWhat a gift to be able to enjoy the world's most beautiful places that I may never get to personally. The sights and beautiful music are inspiring and made me appreciate the wonders of God's creation even more than I already do. I've watched the entire series and enjoyed the artistry of each moment. If everyone was doing what they love to do, like you obviously are, this world would run as beautifully and wondrously as Nature. T. S.--Transformations"
5,So relaxing,"Last night I watched the DVD, Worlds Most Beautiful Places, I just simply don't know what to write. Gosh it made me wish for a big screen in my garden bathroom so I could watch it while I relaxed in a tub of bubbles. While writing this I now realize I can bring my wide screen laptop in there and watch it hmmmmmmmm I may do just that this week, it is so relaxing, peaceful and beautiful. The images and sounds really seem to bring me there.....mmmmmmmmmmmmTake the time to enjoy the wonders of our earth."
1,DVD,"This product was totally unusable on any DVD-Player I tried it on. I specifically bought it in HD so that it would fit on my large screen Television. It would not play. Further inspection on the back of the product (in the fine print) said that it was only playable on one DVD-Player (HD) that was sold in 2007. I went on-line to investigate the issue and found that there was no support for that DVD-Player in HD. So, this five year old HD movie should not even be on the shelf for retail sale. I did not take it back for a refund. That process is just not worth my time."
1,Living Landscapes: The World's Most Beautiful Places,"Disc was bad. Indicated in wrong format. Tried on Blu-ray, regular DVD and Computer and nothing in my house would read the disc.Figured it would cost me more to send it back than it cost. If the cost seems too good to be true, then there is a reason for it.This is not the first time I have had a problem with a DVD purchased on Amazon.Do NOT Buy this DVD as you could have the same problem."
2,Living Landscapes,This is my second HD DVD I order and it won't play on my DVD player or Blu Ray player. Don't understand why.
1,No worth the time,"This program is poorly designed. It focus on details that are not significant to the place it tries to show. like two horses in the field for two minutes, waves that could be anywhere in the world. You need to actually have visited the place in order to recognize it. It discourage me to physically be in those places after viewing this video."
3,"Pretty scenery, but too ""noisy""","Was very beautiful scenery, but would be much better if you could actually hear the birds, waves... Would maybe recomend it to someone who has a new HDTV picture and wanted to watch spectacular views. Disappointing."
1,Its HD DVD,Why are you even looking at this? Its HD DVD. That tech is dead. Go find a bluray version. This video sucked anyway. It was supposed to be a demonstration of HD video but my phone quality put it to shame.
5,An indispensable collection of rare Soul ballads.,"This is most definitely a unique and special compilation of rare and obscure Soul ballads. Disc One focuses on tougher, gospel-flavored and at times blues-infused ballads while the second disc is devoted to Northern Soul harmony vocals. The sound quality is uniformly good on both CDs and the breadth of groups and solo singers featured is in itself remarkable. Given all it has to offer this package's price is very reasonable and I highly recommend it to any serious fan or devotee of classic 1960s-'70s Soul balladry. The near-total lack of relevant liner notes and discographical annotation is the only fault I can find here--but don't let that stop you from buying it!!!"
2,Poker Academy Texas Hold'em,"I am a registered owner of this program (Poker Academy Texas Hold'em v2.5) for several years now. A year or so ago I was unable to get the online version to work, but could still use the program on my computer. Now I want to move the program to my other computer and I find that the Company seems to be totally gone. No support, no reinstalling, no nothing. Has anyone else heard any time about this company or experienced the same thing?"
2,Stiff,"I guess I'm just used to buying Pedipeds and Umi shoes, but I was really surprised at how extremely stiff the soles of these shoes are. It sounds from the reviews like they might break in okay, but for a little more, I can get shoes that don't require breaking in. I'm returning."
5,Really Cute Train,"We bought this for my grandson Christmas 2007. He was 8+ months at that time. His father (my son) is 6'7"", so my grandson is very tall for his age. This little train fit his size well.There are all kinds of neat things to play with on the train, a top sort of thing on the steering wheel, a horn, and there is a secret compartment under the seat.Besides just being as cute as can be, this toy seems to be quite sturdy. He did tip over on it once, as some other reviewers have mentioned and I told my son about putting a weight in the compartment; I don't know if he ever did that or not.I don't know about the educational aspect of this toy, so gave it 4 stars. It does have a lot of little activities on it. I could happily recommend this toy for toddlers."
5,My kids favorite,"I kept telling my wife that we had to leave a review for this. We don't normally leave reviews but... our kids absolutely LOVE this train.As I type this, my 2.5 year old son is scooting around the kitchen island on this train. When he stops long enough, his 9 month old sister takes over by climbing all over it. She likes to turn the dial, push the buttons etc.Our son is a bit jealous at times but is finally learning to share it. He loves to store his matchbox cars in the seat container. It makes a nice central spot for his favorite toys in life.This train is well build and the only sturdiness issues we had were the result of our son ""testing its limits"" intentionally. Nothing major but a tip to the side and a quick recovery. He has since learned not to do that.We've had this train for 10 months now and my son loves it more than ever. I would buy anoher one in a heartbeat if this one disappeared."
5,great quality toy and smart construction,"I bought this toy for my daughter who is 21 months and she and I both love it! The quality of the materials is fantastic. The wheels turn great when you move the steering wheel and they are made of a solid plastic which work nicely on carpet and hard floors. The front of the train is solid and feels very strong and the toys that are part of the train are darling! This is the best toy purchase I have ever made. And the colors of the train are so bright. Also, my daughter is tall for her age and this is the highest ride-on toy I could find and it has a wide base which is also a plus. You won't regret it--buy it now!"
3,LOTS OF FUN BUT...,"I would not recommend buying this product if you have hard wood floors. I wish I'd known that. It is a hit with my son in terms of pressing all the fun buttons and pushing it around. Problem is it is so lightweight he has fallen on many occasions and lost his footing. Best to use this product on carpet. Also I suggest putting ankle weights inside the middle compartment so that it doesn't fall over. It is not as sturdy as I thought. Also the handle on the back that allows baby to push the truck comes out too easily. It should have some kind of snap and lock feature.PROS: You don't need batteries and it is one of the few toys that my son is entertained byCONS: Too lightweight, falls over easy, handle comes out too easily"
4,Just One Thing...,We've only had this toy for about a week and so far my 20-month-old son really likes it. It's not his favorite but he likes riding it around the house and playing with the little bead-popper thing on top. My only complaint is that the handle on the back does not lock in place and I end up having to put it back on about 50 times a day when he pulls it out. But he enjoys it and I'm glad I purchased it as his Valentine's Day present.
4,Great toy for baby,"My son got this for Christmas, he was 8 months old when he got it. At first he wasn't too sure about it, just sat on it. But now that he is more mobile and trying to learn to walk it has been a great toy. He loves to push one of the levers back and forth and then stands behind it and pushes it. He hasn't learned how to sit and push on it but his legs are still a little too short. My 3 yr old daughter also loves it."
3,Cute...but not practical,"Do I think this is the cutest pacifier holder out there? Yes, absolutely! But for the price ($7.99), it's not very practical. For one, the velcro is not wide enough that when the product gets snagged, it comes apart (I've had to pick mine up many times). Secondly, you have to squeeze the pacifier in there (we use the Soothie) and last but not least, it's hard to clean this item (we wanted to clean it as often as possible...afterall, it's holding the pacifier). I think that the Pacifier Keeper at $1.99 is much more practical, although not as cute.So for cuteness: 4 starsFor Practicality: 1 1/2 stars"
1,glad this was free on kindle!,"this was ok, but there was a lot of heavy-handed writing re trying to get us to suspect one particular character.*****SPOILER ALERT*****So--I am expected to forgive the love interest who hit his ex-wife, just the one time, because she had an abortion. The author doesn't come out and say that this was justified violence, but it's implied. And we should believe a police officer would tell a woman that a man who broke another woman's jaw is really an ok guy?This part of the plot pissed me off a LOT"
2,A let down,"I had to contintually force myself to continue reading this book to the end, but I had made it halfway through so...Nonetheless, the story was dry, overly dramatic, and had some of the worst red herrings I've encountered. While some of the characters were interesting, I would not recommend this book to anyone else."
2,Ending so disappointing,I was going to give the book a 3 or 4 until the end. The entire time the author tried to make us think that one person was the murderer. So much so that it became kind of comical. Then I realized that what would make the book great is if that person WAS the killer because then it would almost be a surprise. When it turned out to be someone unimportant for a ridiculous reason I was very disappointed. Spoiler ahead: A great ending would have been Cam as the killer and her winding up with Scott.
5,Great Christmas present,I ordered this for my 5 year old daughter to replace the one she got for Christmas at 15 months old (also a Kidcraft)... she has not left this table since Christmas morning... it's a great upgrade for how she's grown. The only warning I would offer is we did get a pad of paper jammed in the drawer so I would recommend only storing crayons/markers in it as it's a very thin drawer. Easy to assemble.
3,it is work but too expensive,I am agree with the first comment. It helped me a lot term of wrist pain but the mouse looks very cheap. I think it's cost is not more than 10 us
1,BEWARE Terrible vhs to DVD-R Transfer,"BEWARE, Save your Money! This appears to be a Non legitimate factory DVD. The prints are obviously washed out VHS to DVD-R transfers. Even the cover art is just as horrid; it's a blown up, quality degraded photo. To top things off, the DVD menu looks like it was produced with some ""cheese bag"" software. I am SHOCKED & amazed that Amazon is allowing this DVD-R to be sold at all. Yecchh!"
1,Defective Product,The item was shipped in a timely manner. It has a slow leak around the plug which requires inflation before every use. I plan to keep the item since I had such a hard time finding this one.
3,Small Bottles,I had remember these bottles as being bigger. They ar quite small and took a long time to get here.
3,radius grip trowel,"My trouble with trowels is that I can overpower them and bend or break the shaft. That's not a problem with this one. It is very sturdy. I lowered the rating because the handle is green, absolutely the dumbest color for a garden implement. I lose it regularly in the flowers and am considering wrapping the handle in red duct tape."
3,Nothing spectacular,"It isn't especially sharp, so it doesn't cut into the soil very easily. No major complaints, but it's not my favorite tool either."
5,Very comfortable!,"Love the handle and color! Must get the other products. When having the proper tools, you will want to garden more without feeling uncomfortable or achy."
2,There are better toasters,"I sent this toaster back after 4 weeks of occasional use. I bought it after reading all the great customer reviews and was greatly disappointed. The toaster does have the capacity to toast quite thick items such as bagels, but for a regular slice of toast, it does not do a good job. Because of the wide openings for bagels, when it pulls down a regular size piece of bread, it pulls the bread closer to one side rather than right in the middle. I like my toast medium brown, it always came out with one side medium brown and the other side was merely warmed--no color."
1,This is not a keeper.... D+,"I must have read a different book again! What a boring story line. At the end of the book, I asked myself where the romance was. When did these two characters fall in love? True, I have been reading a lot of paranormal romance lately, and maybe my taste in this genre has changed. But, this is not a 5, 4, 3, or 2 star book. The only book from this author I have enjoyed was ""The Dangerous Man."" Don't buy this book, borrow it from the library or buy in for a quarter at your nearest garage sale. One star for effort!"
4,Trippin' On Tracy's CD,"I was fortunate enough to interview and meet Tracy Silverman, and after doing so, I have an even greater appreciation for his solo debut. His eclecticism and diversity as a musician and a music FAN makes this record jarringly different and, in its own way, quite beautiful! The sounds he can make with his electric violin amaze me."
4,Great ideas in this book,"I found this book very helpful in overall ideas of where to hike and what to expect. There is a lot of detail. What I think could be improved is the overall formatting of the information. It is fragmented and the reader has to dig a bit to get the necessary info. Also, a more detailed description of what to see during each hike (like petroglyphs, ruins etc). But, these criticisms are minor compared to the vastly useful information contained within. Excellent book and a ""must have"" for hikers to this area."
3,"Good news, bad news","This book has the most thorough coverage of the canyon country available. It's allowed us to find several sites that we couldn't find in any other guidebook. That's the good news. The bad news is that what Kelsey considers non-technical often requires a harness and rope. He's obviously a climber, and on several occasions we've had to backtrack because we came to an impassable pour-off or cliff. So just be advised that hikers will often find the non-technical to be more technical than they'd expect from the descriptions."
4,Much better than traditional light/magnifiers!,"I found the wormlight to be MUCH better than tradtional light/magnifiers, mainly because this is only a light, not a light/magnifier. I'm glad someone finally got the idea that people who are buying a light might not want a magnifier, too! :-) Another nice feature: You don't get as much of those rainbow streaks across the screen. In fact, at a certain angle, you get none at all! The only drawbacks are that it still does cause some of those streaks occasionally, and depending on the angle, you can get a big glare-y spot on the screen. My suggestion: When you get it out of the package, stretch it up a little bit, then plug it into your GB and tilt it towards you a bit. This seems to reduce glare and streaks."
3,Irish P.I.,"Attempt at slick writing in the style of Mickey Spillane,doesn't quite pull it off. Hope to see more sophisticated,streamlined writing in future. Shows promise but local research insufficient for subject matter."
3,LOVE this toy but...,"My son loved this toy - still does - but as he's about in the 150% for his height, he is way too tall for it. He easily climbs over the guard rail and tips the car over on it's side or goes head first over the front. He sits calmly when we take a walk around the block with it, but otherwise, he is very inquisitive and could hurt himself by checking out his car while it's sitting still."
4,Easy viewing,It's fun to get an insider view of life of the rich and almost famous. The best actor---by a long shot---is Jerome Piven. He carries this series. It is fun to watch because nothing extremely heavy ever happens to anyone. The plots are simple and uncomplicated. This is the kind of show I like to watch late at night because it doesn't ever dig too deep.
5,entourage,arrived quickly and in the condition as stated. what more can be said other than Entourage is a great tv series.
4,always entertainment with Entourage,Not as good as season 1 or 3 but still plenty of laughs and fun to watch with groups
2,It should have been a better book,I was checking the reviews to see if I missed something that others saw in this book. I was confused and gave up on the book about 3/4 of the way though it. I enjoy King's writings and thought this would be just as good but I was wrong. Sorry King.
1,Rip Off,"I usually like King's books but there was no reason for him to write this one. Desperation is pretty good and tells the story of all the characters and TAK. How much money does he need?. The characters are all the same, the evil is the same as in Desperation. The only thing changed is the setting. These are identical stories. How many books does he want on the best seller list? One is not enough? I wonder if next time he will publish 3, then 4, why not 10? Just change the town and there we go. It just needs his name and it sells. He must be laughing all the way to the bank. At least I did not buy the book.-Mitc"
3,"Decent, but for completists only","Without question, this one doesn't begin to stack up against Desperation. Some new elements fall into place, but nothing too exciting."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be......,"I read Desperation first, about 3 months before reading this book. I could hardly put Desperation down, thats how good it was to me. I was curious to read The Regulators because I had heard about the similarities to Desperation. It started off pretty good, and I kept reading to see what would happen. Then it just got too drawn out and uneventful, and some parts didn't make any sense to me. I finished the book, but it was definitely not as good as Desperation. I would only recommend it if you just need another King read."
2,"If I was King, I'd have used a phony name too.","Slightly more imagination involved here than in Desperation. However, that's not saying much. The (ahem) plot simply repeats itself after the first couple of chapters, and you really won't care whether the characters live or die. Two things drove me to finish it: first was the novelty of finding where it crosses with Desperation, but that wore thin pretty quick; second was the futile hope that the ending would redeem Desperation's hurried, hokey conclusion - it didn't. About the only good thing I can say about it is that its theme of religious salvation/redemption isn't as blatant or as annoying as it was in Desperation."
1,"If it wasn't Bachman/King, would it sell?","No way. Without King's name connected to this book, it wouldn't have been printed. Desperation is marginal at best. The Regulators should have died (and been buried) with Bachman."
4,Definently a twin novel to Desperation,"Because I loved Desperation so much, i picked up this sister book. it is a fast paced stephen king classic loaded with violence and gut wrenching description. i enjoyed this book because it had similar elements to that of Desperation...and although names were switched aroud there were the same characters as its sister novel. if i had to choose...Desperation is better written but The Regulators comes with vivid imagination and a twist on Tak thats satisfying."
3,"A good book, but confusing with companion book","I can't recall which King (Bachman) book I read first, The Regulators or Desperation. The first one I read was good, interesting and a lot of action. The second one I read was confusing as heck. It's like King took all the characters, put them in a blender, and came out with the new book. The story is the same, the characters names are all the same, but now their characteristics are all different. A hero in the first book could be the bad guy in the second book. I couldn't seem to keep track of what was going on because I kept trying to reference the first book. I would give the first one I read 4 stars and the second one 2 stars, so they average 3. Not sure why King took this tack for these books. Strange. Overall, each one is a fun King story. If you like King, you should enjoy them. I just wouldn't recommend reading both. Stick to one or the other, and you should be happy. I wish I had."
2,Miss,"Stephen King has his share of hits and misses and THE REGULATORS is a definite miss. I have to give King credit for attempting to create a layered novel--a technique that Avi did with far better results in NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. However, the story was flat and the characters weren't clearly drawn enough for me to keep straight. The plotting was slow and the story should have been cut by about half.King is prolific, but not every idea should see the light of day. This had the feel of a rush to publish companion to another title. THE REGULATORS could have been a better book--the ideas themselves are interesting enough--had King spent more time thinking about it."
1,ABRIDGED! INEXCUSABLE!,"I don't know how Penguin is getting away with releasing Abridged Stephen King books on audio. If their mediocre quality re-releases weren't bad enough, now this!Don't buy."
5,Toby's Count It All Joy is a A Unique Winner,"What a uniquely written and very entertaining approach to love and healing; or is it healing and love! This book weaves romance, psychology, suspense and humor into a moving tale. Check it out to find out...you won't be disappointed. This book leaves you not just wanting, but actually ready for or feeling like you ""need"" a sequel. Also, like a good television show, you find yourself almost talking to the characters trying to warn them of pitfalls, or direct them towards good outcomes, and ultimately their joy."
2,No Removable Terminal Nut :-(,All the sites that i have seen this plug on state that it has a Removable Terminal Nut. The package i received in the mail came without the Removable Terminal Nut. I am somewhat unhappy with that and the only way for me to use this plug is for me to cut the top down to size to fit my coil sticks on them.Here is a ling of the same plug with a Removable Terminal Nut:[...]This really sucks and now i have to spend money at a machine shop to modify the plug.
3,Bottle feeding babies,"While I do like this book and most of the illustrations are beautiful, I thought I would comment on the pictures of bottle feeding babies. I prefer my child to see pictures of breastfed babies and as I didn't know these kind of pictures were in the book, I just wanted to mention it in case someone else might not want it for that reason. For you attachment parents--babies are also in cribs in this book. I only mention this to help others who might make a purchase decision based on this information, not to insult others who are not bothered by this. I did keep my book. Hope that helps someone!"
5,Charming,"My three-year-old daughter and I love this book so much that we wore out our first copy (unfortunately, the binding isn't terribly durable) and we had to order another one. I'm now buying this for gifts for other little girls who I hope might appreciate the simplicity, innocence, and old-fashioned charm of Eloise Wilkin's illustrations. I'm so glad this book is in print!"
2,I was unhappy it didn't come as I undersood the advertising.,"I expected a swet of these little Golden Books and it came in one big book. I bought it for my sister's daycare for the little children, and it is too bulky for a small child, and for her to handle it while reading to them. However, of course the stories themselves and illustrations deserve 5 stars...just didn't state it was all in one big book!"
2,Not worth it,"This book fails on several fronts. One, the main character, a Latina detective, has enough of a chip on her shoulder -- several, in fact -- that reading about them grows tiresome and overshadows all else. The story moves along at a decent pace, but the plot strains and finally breaks from lack of credible motives and interesting characters. There's also a lack of research. One of the victims is portrayed as a good guy, ethical and hard-working. But the story reveals he flashed a fake badge to get access to documents -- both highly unethical and a felony -- facts oblivious to the writer. The newsroom settings and references ring untrue to this former newsroom worker."
1,boxed wrong,"well as the title says, the product was boxed wrong. simple mistake, but still takes time for me to send it back and get a refund/exchange. when I received the product, it was the smallest one available, and I ordered the biggest one. so needless to say, I couldn't just make it work. sorry for the honest but bad review, maybe next time you'll take a little extra effort and box the product accordingly."
3,hard to be too picky for the price,"One of the earpieces broke off right after it arrived. The glasses themselves work well and I wasn't looking for something extremely durable, especially for the price."
2,Bogus bonus features and old familiar footage,"I bought this product new, sealed with both tape and shrink wrap. However, two of the bonus features listed on the jacket simply do not exist on the DVD. Specifically, the Ernie Terrell and Jerry Quarry fights are missing. The Cleveland Williams and Henry Cooper matches are included as advertised. Perhaps just my copy is defective? But you're playing Russian roulette if you're counting on the extras. The two bonus interviews are familiar stuff and not much longer than soundbites. The footage of Earnie Shavers vs. Ali is good, but slight, perhaps thirty seconds of the final round. Most of the other footage is very familiar to collectors of Muhammad Ali DVDs and VHS. I recommend ""Muhammad Ali, The Whole Story"" for real fans and boxing buffs."
5,Best New Trance Artist,"This is one of the best Trance CD's to come along in years! The music itself is awesome, and the singer's voice is so beautiful (and even ""haunting"" at times!). The fact that the lyrics are in Korean makes no difference, anyone can enjoy this music (just as all ""future pop"" fans can enjoy Melotron in German). Although the entire CD is great, the first five tracks are the best. Cosmic Ally is at it's best when it comes to the faster, more upbeat tracks. The only ""negative"" is that this is apparently Cosmic Ally's only CD to date. They are far past due for a follow-up CD!"
4,Fast but highlighted?,I ordered this book for a class and saw it was signed. I figured I could give it to a neighbor when I was finished. The book arrived fast and packed with little waste. As I flipped through it I saw highlighting - PINK highlighting. Kind of off-sets the signed value. I'll still give it to my neighbor but was surprised someone would highlight a signed book.
4,A very good beginning,"This is a book that helps us understand, politically, socially and economically how we came to be where we are as both Americans and Southerners today. There are many of us who have benefited in direct, but complicated ways from this time who would like to forget it and move on. There is merit in this, but we forget the times and events at our peril.The book makes a better read in the beginning than in the later chapters and bogs down in what seems to be political and personal minutia more valuable to an academic discussion than an avid, but everyday history student and getting to the end took real determination. It requires a second reading."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I was slightly disappointed watching this. I saw part of Lavelle Crawford's segment online and bought the DVD. He was by far the best of the group. He still tells a lot of ""fat"" jokes, but he was funny nonetheless. Arnez J. should retire, he was the pits. I got a few laughs from Earthquake. DL Hughley was a good host."
4,Wayside Series,The boxed set of the Wayside School Series came in good condition. Books are funny and entertaining for all ages.
1,Pages messed up,This is a poor copy of the book 'sideways stories from a wayside school.' Some pages are duplicated and many are left out all together. Don't order this set.
3,Wayside School Is Falling Down,This book is Sideway Stories From Wayside School by Louis Sachar. Mrs. Jewels dropped a computer out the window to teach the kids about gravity. That is the way it happens at Wayside School. There are twenty-nine kids is Mrs. Jewels class this story is about them about. I liked this book because it is funny.
5,A Gift,"Ordered this set for my daughter for Christmas, as she has been asking for it for a while. It arrived promptly and in great shape!"
3,Face sticks out farther than the rim,"Although I love the look of this watch, I am noticing that it gets scratched much too easily! The face of watch is just a little above the rim, and it takes the brunt of any walls, desks, etc;, and gets scratched very, VERY easily. Timex could have solved this problem by dropping the face a millimeter, putting it below the rim, and all would be good."
4,perfect for entertaining,"I got this after I broke an old chip cooler- this is perfect of outdoor bbq's- fill with dip cover it and put in fridge. Later on, filled with ice and the dip was good to go all night. It was packaged fine and arrived in good condition."
3,Versatile Server,"Bought this for a party, can keep dips warm or cold for a decent amount of time.Hijacked it from my wife, makes a good bowl for shaving lather (Brush and soap/cream)not canned goo, fill outer bowl with barely boiling water, inner bowl with warm water and insert brush.After showering (15~20 minutes)empty inner bowl and proceed to lather, will keep your lather VERY WARM 20~25 minutes."
4,Episode list & summary missing- How Cheap Is That!,"After I received the long awaited 9th DVD last week I was quite disappointed to discover that there was no episode summary included in each disk as was the case with seasons 1-8 nor was there any printed list and summary included with the DVDs. How cheap is that ?! The manufacturer could have easily taken a little time and little cost to include list of episodes and a brief summary with the set. I was able to locate a Season 9 list almost immediately on line at Wikipedia. I hope that when Season 10 and beyond are individually released that this ""oversight"" does not occur again...but I am not going to hold my breath."
3,Defective DVD,"The first DVD in the set is defective!! The first 2 episodes make my Bluray player shift and jump and go crazy. The sound cuts out and then the picture looks like it is being fast forwarded, racing to catch up instead of just skipping. The Menu system is affected too making the a bunch of clicking and jumping sounds! Also I read the comments and I agree an episode description would be nice. I have to guess and end up changing DVD's because once it starts I realize that I've seen this one already or just don't like these episodes. The Writers didn't put much effort into this one just like Season 8 most of them aren't thought through and don't make sense. C'mon guys I'm a Fan but gimme something interesting and STOP being lazy. Get rid of whoever's Brother-in-Law you had to hire and write us some good stuff that at least matches up to the rest of the story."
2,A fine kickboard if you are already in great shape,"This kickboard is far smaller than I expected. Although the design itself seems great, it just isn't buoyant enough to use if you weigh more than about 150 lbs."
5,Fits like a dream,"I'm quite happy with this sleeve, it fits my new MacBook Pro like a glove and (so far) has kept it from getting scratched up."
2,Attractive - but doesn't suction to sink,"I wanted an attractive sponge holder that would suction to the inside of my kitchen sink so that it would drip into the sink and not take up room on my kitchen counter. I thought that is what this did, but it has no suction. It is meant to sit on the countertop. While it's attractive, it's not that attractive for me to want my spong still hanging out on my countertop. I guess I will return and try and go for the ones that suction."
4,It does what it's supposed to do,"No rust, still shiny after 2 1/2 years, looks cute on the counter. My only complaint is that it's a little small but perfect for one sponge or one drain stopper."
3,"Great scissors, but don't count on blue!","These are terrific easy-to-use scissors, but useless to my 3rd-grade son for whom I bought them -- he refuses to take them to school because they arrived in magenta, instead of the blue shown. Kids care about stuff like that, so I think they should be specific about the color of ""student"" scissors..."
3,"A ""Must Have"" for any Deer Hunter's Library","There is no 'bad' food, just bad preparation. As a serious amateur cook and a deer hunter, it just seems sensible that I learn to do everything possible to preserve the culinary possibilities of the game I harvest. The book provides great detail on proper field dressing, butchering and preparation techniques for deer--an expert guide to getting the most that an animal offers in its supreme sacrifice.I read it once through, and plan to have it as a reference for the upcoming hunting season. I won't argue with the content, which is consistent with what I've gleaned from other professional butchers, but the presentation of the information could be better--more illustrations or well-lighted pictures comes to mind."
5,Excellent book,"This is a good book on handling and processing a deer. It has good narrative, O.K. photos and recipes. This was purchased for my first deer and I found it extremely helpful. Karen"
5,Awesomeness,"This album is very good. Catchy songs, smart lyrics and great musicianship. Reeve Oliver will blow your socks off."
3,nice but outdated,"a really beautiful map, colors and writing are very clear for even small children who are interested in geography, they will enjoy it, it is a bit outdated"
2,No Website code/support from WROX.,"Don't expect any code from this book from the WROX website - the book says it's available but I couldn't find it - and the people at WROX don't answer their email. I like the book, don't like the publisher much."
1,Unfortunately wrong delivery,I ordered 2 x Petite Cherie from Annick Goutal. Unfortunately I received only 1 x Petite Cherie and another scent from Annick Goutal which I never ordered and which is really not my taste. Disappointingly the one petite Cherie perfume was only in the standard bottle and not like promised on the photo with the butterfly bottle. As I went to a conference to the US I dit not have time to contact the supplier to inform about the wrong delivery. I will probably try to get in touch today to see whether they can make a change.
3,Step in the right direction,"While this first solo effort by Brian Setzer lacks a little of the comfort and crystallized direction of the Stray Cats recordings, it much more clearly demonstrates his musicianship and displays musical roots other than rockabilly. Looking back on this record after listening to his current swing recordings, it is easy to see that he was expanding and working toward another musical direction. There are some great songs on this CD and any Setzer fan won't be disappointed, though it is clearly not Stray Cats or swing."
2,Derivative Songs from a Solo Stray Cat,"The first solo album from the top Stray Cat tries but fails to match the earnest sound of mid-80s heartland rockers like Springsteen, Mellencamp, and Bob Seger. Setzer's lyrics are especially morose, perhaps inspired by his acrimonious parting with his former bandmates, Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom, who had already scored a hit with Earl Slick, ""Men Without Shame."" Within a year, the Stray Cats would reunite and return to making rockabilly music, albeit without much chart success, which is what this LP also encountered. A gem or two worth hearing: Setzer's blazing guitar hoedown, ""Barb Wire Fence,"" and his surf music guitar workout on ""Radiation Ranch."""
5,Melody,"This is one of the best recovery books I've ever purchased. Orig is old & falling apart, but autographed by Melody, so it's a keeper. I needed a new one so I bought this one with the journal space! What a fantastic idea. I love it & recommend it for others to reflect & write. THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT EVERYONE WHETHER IN RECOVERY OR NOT! YOU GO AMAZON..."
2,"paints ok, brushes terirble","decent price for paint selection, but the brushes are TERRIBLE. the hairs will come out while you paint, making a huge mess.Decent paint selection though, just plan to buy real brushes."
5,The military of Kashhyyk,"I give this figure aeducational value of 3 because the culture of the wookies is fascinating.You don't have to be a big fan to be sparked up by this figure.It enforces imaginary work.Who knows,you're kid's comic StarWars action hero may be the next Spiderman."
3,comments,"It's just a little quirky....teenager-like....""spooky hot lovin'"". Some of the activities seem legit...feng shui-ing the bedroom for example...but I guess there needs to be something for everyone?!"
5,Great TV,"I love Law & Order. I purchased all of them from season 3 thru season 10. I wanted all the seasons that included Sam Waterson, Jerry Orbach, and especially Benjamin Bratt. I had seen all of these when they were on and it was very nostalgic to watch them again. With all the bad tv shows that are on now, going back to these shows is worth it."
2,Brother can you spare an insert,"I have been a true fan of Law and Order for years. But as the seasons go on sale the product and packaging gets Cheaper and chintzier. Come on--give me an insert please. You want more money and give me less product. And then it seems that the distributors don't know how to count either. I've got season 14--than ten plus 3--where's 13?People let's cut the silliness --if they can't give you a synopsis, much less a season categorically and better packaging we aren't purchasing!!There ought to be a law in order!!!"
4,Richly Entertaining,"Knowing the author was also an essayist and critic, I was prepared for a scholarly and rather literary work. Wrong! Though the central character, Belle Prokoff, is a subtle, fully-dimensional portrait of the long-suffering widow of an alcoholic genius (based on the Jackson Pollock/Lee Krasner saga), the world she inhabits is fraught with pretentious, loopy and/or greedy art-world denizens that Toynton dispatches with flair and obvious relish. The author has an gift for economical, vivid writing that wastes no time and is full of invention. This is a book about the art world that--rarely enough--needn't make insiders wince, but you don't have to care about art to enjoy reading it. An appreciation for colorful dialogue, for well-drawn, ultimately moving characters--in short, for excellent writing--is enough."
2,Beware - Doesn't configure with Vista.,"You have to have Windows XP or other operating system compatible with the product as its not compatible (setup) with Windows Vista. That is a serious problem as YOU MUST use the install utility to be able to configure the product. I still can't quite get it to work with their Linksys SPA 3102 which is the type of product it was designed for.Be careful of their customer support - it is non-existant. Try calling them for help on the Linksys SPA3102 for example, and they refuse to allow their online chat to help you - telling you to call a number. The call is put in India where they can barely read from their script and can not take a detour on - or they get confused, and then must go back to the script. Finally they refer you to the people that you purchased the product from. Hmmm Amazon tech support for a Linksys SPA 3102? Very unfortunately Cisco (mother company of Linksys) has turned their back on the retail market."
4,Potentially slick little product for Linksys TAs,"Pros:I have only had a few days, but seems to work simply and well with my Linksys SPA2102 VOIP TA and Callcentric. Setup sb easy in XP, not so much in Vista (see below). Amazon has the model wrong, this is a WBP54G.With an appropriate Linksys TA, no power supply is needed.Cons:1) No Vista support (but in Vista you can right click on the SetupWizard.exe after unzipping > Compatability > check the Compatibility box and select XP SP2 mode, then check ""Run as Administrator"" > Apply, then run. Be sure to unplug and replug power supply if no device appears).2) No registration support I could find and little other support.3) No power supply (for non Linksys TA uses) included"
5,ediesomarr,"what a beautiful chair! nicely detailed. no visible fasteners. very sturdy. they look lovely in my little girls room, she loves them too. I highly recommend this chair."
1,Good fuel for a book-burning session.,"I have read fortune cookies with more substance. After a 2 year bout with insomnia, I must thank the writer, William Kolasa, for permanently curing this condition. A chapter a day is all you need before bedtime. Makes an excellent stocking stuffer for the god-forsaken mother-in-law that we all hate. Out of Raid? Blackflag? Do not fret. This Interlunar trash serves as an excellent roach killer. I too am a prospective writer, and I would like to personally thank the author for teaching me one easy step for success - Do not write like William Kolasa. The book should be appropriately renamed ""An Inter-LOSER Sunder."""
3,"I felt two stars was a bit unfair, so I chose three...","Grand Prix is not a great album, let's face it. It is definitely the worst Tokyo Ska record to date, and I'm sure the only pothole in their road so far. The problem here isn't the music, but what the band is lacking: Cleanhead Gimura. He passed away in April of 1995, most believe from HIV. It comes as no surprise then that this record feels completely uninspired. Even the solos seem to feel kinda meh, which is not their style at all. I think this was a record produced by a band who had lost themselves with the death of their longtime friend and frontman, and really, who can blame them?The crazy thing is that Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra is such an amazing band that this record is STILL better than 90% of the other ska band records I've got."
3,Middle of the Road,"This book is just okay. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could, to reflect the true averageness of this book. It starts out well, with colorful characters in desperate circumstances. The parts about Kiki's life, Soupspoon's battle with illness, and his early introduction to the blues lifestyle are interesting and well-told. The story peters out about halfway in, however, and one never really shares or believes in Soupspoon's obsession with his past with RL. The last half of the book seems hurriedly written, and contains some unexpectedly hackneyed story elements--the stuff with Chevette, in particular. (Didn't this same ridiculous male fantasy crop up in that other truly average novel ""About Schmidt?"")"
2,Not very entertaining or inspiring,"This video is the one that my child of 32 months is the least interested in. It is rather one-dimensional and does not engage the child. I found it to be boring and not fun. If I could return it, I would. Strangely enough, she and I prefer Barney's Let's Play School much more, even though it is choreographed."
1,"Great content, but terrible value for money","We've recently bought a DVD player, mainly to get English-language educational material for our 2 year old (we live in Taiwan). Compared to some of the other DVDs/VCDs that we have bought, this one has great content; our boy is glued to it.However, the whole DVD from start to finish, is only 21 minutes long. This is a huge disappointment, as they could easily have fitted 3 episodes on the DVD (as ""Bear in the Blue House"" does). Also, no subtitles and no additional material at all. Really *very* poor value for money."
3,Poor production quality,"I bought this for my niece who has not yet seen it, so I cannot comment on the quality of the content, but I did watch it and was surprised at the poor production quality. The tape seems to be recorded in extended play mode, resulting in a somewhat grainy picture with occasion horizontal lines running down the screen. Also, the voices of some of the characters are recorded by children who mumble, making it difficult to understand what they are saying."
2,Not Her Best,"I have read just about every Alice Hoffman book that there is, and I have to say that this one was definitley not one of my favorites. I finished the book thinking, what was the point? There is no real story about any one character, just a bunch of stories of each person's lives in the comunity. I kept thinking that she was eventually going to center around Nora Silk, but she really never did. I think if she had done that, then there would have been more of a storyline. Unfortunatley, I would not recommend this book."
2,Too Much of the Same Old Stuff,"More of Hoffman's same old stuff--divorced woman trying to make it, troubled young boys trying to make it, troubled couples trying to make it, et cetera, et cetera. If this is the first of her books that you read, maybe you'll like it better. But having read several others, the familiarity was too much--couldn't get through it."
5,Dominion is excellent.,"Alcorn did his research on the Black culture and history. The storylineis gripping, suspenseful and well laid out with God's message and Word interwoven like a beautiful tapestry. Deadline was great, Dominion is even better."
5,Dominion,Book was a good read.Book arrived in a very timely fashion.Book arrived in excellent condition.
1,BORING,I did not care for this book.The characters were boring and it took too long to get into it.I stopped reading it bc it was so boring.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.Im glad I checked it out and didnt waste my money buying it!!!
5,Large stuffed Octopus,"My grandson was thrilled, large and excellent quality. He is still carrying it around and smiling. I would recommend this stuffed octopus for any child that is interested in the ocean. He is now looking at books about ocean life."
5,themeatnpotatoesofitall,"awesome work,..if there is a stuffed animal two buy this is the one..very realistic (arms are not stiff and can be posed very cool)..was going to be a gift..keepin this one..will buy more for gifts..worth every dollar..need one same size reddish orange color..can ya help me out?..good work to the creative team behind it.. keep em real looking,.. and keep them comin.."
3,"Good game, not the best, not the worst",The AI seems like the developers could have spent a little more time working on. Basically a very well done mod of Myth II. But still just a mod though. Missions are hard in that the objectives given are pretty vague and inconsequential.Good game for any Myth II fan to have as a mod but if I had to choose which was done and plays better. . . Myth II hands down.
5,Outstanding,I orginally owned the book in the 90s found it a useful and comprhensive look into a different war in a different time.
5,Great for bed time.,"My son loves the show ""Little Einsteins"" and recognizes quite a few of the songs from that show. We put it on a bed time and he loves it."
3,Champs,It is as advertised. I was surprised at the music The Champs created. The only thing I knew they had done was 'Tequila' but they covered some other songs quite nicely. Worth a listen.
5,Flawless Soundtrack,this soundtrack is awsome first of all anyone who has a history of buying soundtracks alot of them have songs that are already on your cds or remixed not with this soundtrack almost every track is brand new from upcoming albums that arent even out yet and are previosly unreleased so this is the best soundtrack for the suggested title go and buy it
4,Horror/Metal Trend,Another fine example of the horror movie genre bringing out a soundtrack completely metal. The album as a whole is fine with a few exceptional tracks. Ill Nino and Spineshank lead the way. Slipknot's Snap should've been released on their 'Slipknot' album 4 years ago. These sort of albums have always proven to be the start of many bands' careers or given them more exposure. This movie will be popular and no doubt this soundtrack will too.
5,Hell Yeah !!!!!,"Men, I haven't seen the movie BUT I bought the soundtrack & it's just great !!! All the best metal bands airing these days (Chimaira, Slipknot, Stone Sour, In Flames etc..) are there !!!! Plus I discovered Spineshank & they rock !!!!! Except Murderdolls, Mushroom head (what the hell was that ????) & Type-O, this soundtrack is by far the best I've heard in years !!!! GO JASON, KILL THAT STUPID FREDDY !!!!!"
5,Don't miss out on this little treasure,"Okay, I'll admit from the start that I have a certain bias about this book. Although I've never met the author in person, his wife & I were good friends in high school and involved in lots of activities together - school, church, choir, attending concerts, etc. I reconnected with my friend in 2004 and learned then that her husband was a writer. Out of curiosity, I read some of Ed's pieces from Attic Salt, his column in the Baton Rouge Advocate and loved his style. When I came across the book, I had to have it and was not disappointed. Warm, witty, funny, nostalgic - sweet memories of growing up in Central Louisiana. This is a delightful and easy read. A great book of personal essays to read again and again. It's not often you get to review a book where you know several of the characters. This book is written from the heart. It's a treasure!"
3,Keeping up with the Bobbies (spoiler alert),"The toughest part of being a Yorkshire serial killer is competing with the local police, who are killing any innocent bystander that gets wind of their corruption, copy-cat killing witnesses, orchestrating executions, gunning down innocent bystanders, fabricating evidence, and even killing members of the force when necessary, the whole time bungling the one thing they should be doing, which is catching the Ripper. Yorkshire is one tough place; one can only imagine the hospitality they reserve for tourists.This movie makes you wonder if disarming the police in the UK is a simple effort to keep the public safe from their rampant corruption.The movie was decent enough - but if you are looking for crime-thriller action, with less focus on police corruption and more focus on a serial killer investigation, look elsewhere."
5,agrees with reviewer also,"Lost boy is an excellent book, and because of a reviewers recommendation I bought both this book and Nightmares Echo. There is no sensationalism in either book, just honesty,truth and hard to deal with lives of children. Children that live around us daily, right under our noses. i recommend everyone read these emotional books"
5,Heartbroken,"Well, I'm a G12 student from Hong Kong, I just picked up the book at my school library for my book report. As I read, my eyes were filled with tears and my heart was broken to pieces. I had to stop after reading for 10 pages. As my emotion didn't allow me to go any further. I took a break and began to read again, I sobbed. I sympathize your sad childhood, at the same time, I'm really furious with the what-so-called mother. I finally realize how lucky I am to be born in this family of mine. Thank God. I guess everyone in the world will sympathize Dave's childhood, no matter you are in Japan, China, UK, USA and so on. This is one of the books that has made me cry so bitterly."
4,It's GGGGGRRRRREEEAT,"Well this is the second of the trilogy and it is as wonderful as the first. Didn't really want to finish it because I didn't want to know the end. However, once I did finish, I loved it. Hopefully the third is just as good."
5,I will never be the same after reading Dave's books,"I could not put A Child Called It down nor The Lost Boy. At first I did not want to buy the book when I saw what it was about, but I am forever changed because of it. It made me want to reach out to that little boy to love and nurture him. However, I am about 20 years to late. The lesson here is there are many lost boys and girls in our community that I can reach out to. It may not be a child who is abused, but rather lonely or sad for whatever reason. Our children are our future and it is up to us to make a difference in their lives. That is the message I received after reading his two books. I am awaiting the last book to answer many questions. I am saddened that he does not have a relationship with his brothers today. I wish they would reach out to him or vice versa. They could make up for a lot of lost time. I would reccomend this book to anyone. It is the most inspirational story I have ever read."
5,this touched my soul,"As I READ this book the tears flowed freely from my eyes, I WAS SO COMPLETELY overwhelmed with the strength,the compassion and passion in which David told his story. He has come from the depths of hell, yet grew to be close with heaven and at peace with himself. TRUELY TOUCHING TO SEE THAT HE BUILT HIMSELF INTO A WONDERFUL PERSON , THANK YOU DAVID FOR YOU HAVE TOUCHED MY SOUL..... CASS"
5,Dave's heartbreaking story continues...,"The Lost Boy is a very nice sequel to ""A Child Called It."" Mr. Pelzer takes us through his days in foster care - he writes with great honesty and emotions about seeing ""the system"" through the eyes of a child who wanted to be loved and fit in. After reading ""A Child Called It,"" which was filled with unthinkable child abuse, I couldn't put this book down until I was finished with it because I wanted to find out what happened to David. Very inspiring."
5,Very touching,"I was also very touched by this book after reading the first one. It's such a sad story of the author's life, but it kept me going and I wanted to know more."
4,The Lost Boy,"I would totally recommend this book to anyone who wants to read this book. I support this book because it is a story of believing and helping people in need. The Lost Boy, I couldn't put down because every chapter something good or bad would happen to Dave and I would have to keep reading on. The surprises in the story were when Dave had seen his younger brother Russell, with bruises and marks on his arms and legs. This made me very sad because his mother had started abusing Russell. The people that would enjoy reading The Lost Boy are people who need a little hope or faith in their lives, or anybody who like a good story."
5,Forbidden Archeology,Received the order promptly and as advertised.The book is a fascinating compilation of anomalies which cast doubt on the consensus view of history.
1,The Author is asking too much money for this ebook.,The author is asking too much money for this ebook. I would NEVER pay $25 for an ebook. He needs to lower his price.
4,Forbidden Archeology- the hidden history of the human race,"This book is a good technical exposition, but it is not for the lay reader."
1,Pseudo-science Classic,"To be fair, there are worse fantastic archeaology books, any of the Atlantis books will do, but not many that are so heavy-handed and so distinctly paranoid. Every classic ploy of pseudo-science is used in this tome- legititmacy envy, paranoid conspiracy, evidence selection, limited hypothesis, probabilisitic fallacies, citations of out of date (almost laughably out of date) work, distortion, and discussion of minutae at the expense greater information. Anyone who reads this book should read books by genuine archeaologists to see what the authors here missed. Brian Fagan's ""From Black Land to Fifth Sun"" is a good start. A shameful book, and those who accept it as a bona fide work of intellectual investigation are horribly mistaken."
3,Mediocre soundtrack,"Although the movie is GREAT, this soundtrack was not worth the trip, or the cost. You might want to pass this one up."
5,THIS SINGLE IS DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING.,"""Music of my Heart"" is one of the most beautiful songs to come out in awhile. I heard it for the first time on TRL and loved it. Gloria Estefan and *NSYNC sound wonderful together. I hope that *NSYNC's new album ""No Strings Attached"" has the same lyrical and musical quality of this song because it's incredible. I would definitely recommend buying this. Also, the remix is nice as well."
1,"Very boring, generic","The first time I heard this song on the radio, it nearly put me to sleep. It's very forgettable, and the song barely stays in your head for five minutes. It's hard to tell whether Gloria Estefan or 'N Sync is singing at times. Plus the lyrics don't make much sense and it's hard to find a meaning to the song. While Gloria's singing is pretty strong, the members of 'N Sync sound really strained, and just plain annoying as usual. I respect Gloria, but I don't understand why she chose to do a song with 'N Sync. They aren't talented at all, and she could have done a lot better. If you're looking for a better song, check out ""Larger Than Life"" by the Backstreet Boys. It is really upbeat and gets you feeling good."
5,WOW! Even better than I expected!,"I really don't like remakes, so I thought this was gonna be dumb at first, until this 4 year old I babysat watched it.Amethyst learns a new spell and her friend, Ruby gets jealous of her, and uses an un-popular spell on her, bounces off mirrors, and hits RUBY! She becomes so un popular the next day, Coral, the head cheerleader forces Ruby to quit the squad, and Albaster, the nerdy dork troll that always tries to flirt with Ruby, wants to leave him alone, and even her perents don't like her.After she admits her jealosy problem, the spell breaks and she's cool again!"
1,"DiC! DiC, I tell you!","They shoulda just stopped after they dubbed Sailor Moon. But no. They had to go on and make this little... ""cool valley girl troll"" show movie thing! It's sad, really. I feel sorry for those who think that this is the best show since... well, I dunno. End."
2,Far and away worst Goldratt,"I have thouroughly enjoyed Goldratt's other books--each taught me a new framework and how to apply it. Each taught in an interesting and easy to follow manner, and applied the framework to many different problems. This book didn't do that. It restated that the concepts that we learned in the Goal, Critical Chain, and Its not Luck are good and still apply, but doesn't add anything new. As far as I can tell, the only new idea briefly appears in the last chapters-- dollar-day metrics; and seems to appear from out of the blue. On the positive side, the style of writing hasn't changed much-- its still easy to read. If you've read the previous Goldratt books, don't bother. If you haven't, don't bother--go read them!"
2,Medium gives mushroom tummy to dress size 14!,"I bought the medium, thinking it would fit me as I was dress size 14 before I became pregnant. The product came in my fifth month, when I really started to need support. I've only gained 10 pounds, so I'm not huge. The first time I put it on it felt nice and lifting. But when I put on a shirt over it I realized that my pregnant belly mushroomed over it, looking very strange. I tried adjusting the velcro but without the amount of tightness that creates mushroom belly, there's no support. This product will quickly get on your nerves and you'll find yourself donating it, like I did."
2,guarenteed not to roll? HA,"I bought this product because I am pregnant and have trouble with my lower back and hips. I am a petite, but a big lady. I ordered the size recomended, but it was slightly too long and rubbed the top of my legs. Velcro burn is not pleasant. IT is NOT supposed to roll, but it does and the two sticks in the back dig into me. It may just be that it is not the right size, but I am very dissapointed. I Like the BELLY BRA. the elastic on the bottom rolls , but it is much more comfortable and does a better job"
2,for Brit Lit specialists,"I don't think it's something you'd want to read for its own sake unless you have a particular interest in the development of the novel in in the nineteenth century. The plot concerns the efforts of Sir Austin Feverel to prevent his son's marriage and then to break it up. There are ponderous attemps at humor. A tragic and melodramatic ending is tacked on. The story is often difficult to follow, with characters being assigned different names. Jane Austen had already shown how a a tight light novel could be constructed. Madame Bovary had been written (for the diffference between mediocrity and genius compare the descriptions of the food at the wedding breakasts in this and in Madame Bovary). This has the clumsy baggy long-winded structure of Dickens (who was writing Great Expectations at the sme time) but without the great characters and confrontations. This was popular literature in its time, and considered scandalous."
4,The best album I ever heard,"This album is extravagant, the producer is great to do these effects. Here in Malta is very famous for his production and we all love his music, KEEP IT UP MARCO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Chelsea Ceramic Goblets,"The Chelsea ceramic goblets have an old-world flair to the shape, which accent a table for a formal dinner, but are also casual enough for a patio party. Accessories for entertaining can make them complement any theme. The colors (sage and honeydew) are much brighter than they appear on the website, so if they are to be used with dishes one already has, might want to see the colors in a store before buying sets of goblets. I like mine so much, however because of the design, that I am going to buy complementing dishes and bowls to mix and match."
1,The real on 305,"Do not buy this cd, the first two reviews said this is a good cd. NOPE. I'll tell ya the real about this cd. I believe this was 305's first cd, and I don't see how this cd was ever in mass production. While It does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist. 305 got much of the material for this cd on Techmaster P.E.B's masterpiece Bass Computer. Any one who has both cd's can tell. If your looking for bass, you'll find it here. But you can find knock with any bass artist. I give this cd one star for biting Techmaster."
5,"""well that's life....","...so, so short."" This is a beautiful cd. Coming from someone whose cd collection consists of mostly loud, abrasive, and technical music (oh, how I love you DEP), I believe it speaks for itself that this 9-song cd has managed to stay in my music rotation since I discovered this ""emo"" band about a year ago. That label, which I noticed has been used to describe this band in a few other reviews, does kind of a disservice to AF. I mean, it's soft, completely melodic and such...but the music is so superior to what ""emo"" bands today are churning out en masse. There are even trumpet parts in a couple tracks. Can you imagine anyone trying to play brass in [insert generic present-day emo band]? Heads would explode. Put it on when the lady-friend is over. She'll dig it too."
5,Film Noir Classic,"Really memorable film noir movie, a great discovery with all the classic ingredients of great film noir - comparable to great films like ""Out Of The Past"" and ""Touch of Evil""."
5,Correction,"Quite true, this is an excellent collection of perfectly fine works, offered beautifully by an enormously gifted technician and real musician. No reservations on that point. In very recent times, however, we have determined that Meude-Monpas had no African ancestry. I was responsible for that error about twenty years ago, being misled by everything except for the composer's biography. I wondered at that time why a minority citizen would have been a royalist."
3,Not the Debate I Expected,"Although it is a fun story, I was expecting a more developed debate between the cognitive scientist and the novelist. I learned of Thinks in a New Scientist magazine review and was a bit let down by the brief philosophical presentation."
1,Ruined by Lodge's obsession with sex,"Every time the philosophical debate starts to get really interesting, Lodge interrupts it for a sexual pursuit, encounter, or reverie. The quality of the writing about sexual matters is about on the same level as Harold Robbins. In short, Lodge betrays his real talent and wit [as shown in prior books] to bring us a trite, repetitious display of middle-aged male fantasizing......this book is an utter waste of time."
2,Disappointing after under the Tuscan Sun,"I *loved* Under the Tuscan Sun. I read and re-read it and loaned it to several friends. When I saw the new book I was so excited, but after reading it I was very disappointed. I think this is more a reflection of me than the author however. What I loved about Under the Tuscan Sun was the struggle and the passion and the frustration. I empathized with their hopes and dreams and vicariously shared their fears. Bella Tuscany is boring...but so is every day life."
4,Bellas Tuscany,"I read Bella Tuscany while I was living in a villa for a week in an area very close to where the author was living. It was magical for me to be reading about and experiencing the same quality of life simultaneously. I think Frances Mayes did a superb job of capturing community and daily life in these small hill towns. She was able to put into words my impressions and experiences. Being of Italian descent, able to speak the language, and having lived in other parts of Italy at different times, I thought Ms. Mayes was masterful in her ability to capture the esssence of life in this small community. As I was reading, I was wishing I could talk with her. If you have some familiarity with Tuscany, I think the book will come alive for you."
1,Ugh,"This is a pretentious, boring, self-absorbed book. I couldn't finish it. The writer comes across as someone I would never want to meet or spend time with, although I'm willing to believe that this was just the effect her writing had on me. Her attitude toward Italy and the Italians I found patronizing and uneducated. And if I buy a book about Tuscany, I'm not looking to read about the author's family and childhood, etc. Highly UNrecommended. Read MFK Fisher for good food writing, and anyone else in the world besides Mayes for good travel writing."
5,"Bella, bella, bella","I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Mayes brings you to Tuscany, and you can see and feel the land and people around their home. The recipes are terrific (I've tried several). Bella Tuscany is truly a feel-good book, even when bad things happen. I am of Italian extraction, and visited Sicily (the home of my ancestors) a few years ago, with my nieces. I liked this book so much, I ordered two more and sent them to my nieces, so we could all share the wonderful feeling of the ""Sweet Life in Italy"". Truly worth the read."
4,A captivating journey in Italy,"I randomly picked this book out of a friend's collection and was not expecting anything special. Little did I know that I would find an absolute treasure of a novel. Mayes' descriptions of the Tuscan countryside and the other Italian regions she visits (Sicily, Venice...) are totally engrossing. It makes you long to hop on the next flight to Italy! I adored the lush description of her home in Cortona and the local recipes included in the book. More than that, I was really struck by how much Mayes loves not only her own Tuscan home, but the people and the culture of Italy. Her deep affection for her Cortona neighbors gave this book a strong emotional core, and I was really moved by the experience of reading it."
2,Blog-like,"I couldn't finish the book. I found it trivial and boring. The author writes well, her little vignettes are pleasant, but they don't connect very well. I suspect if she weren't already a best-selling author this book would never have been published in its current form."
1,Paragraph Outline,"OK, I really wanted to like this novel, and was looking forward to reading an adventure about the Templar Knights. This book reads like a draft outline of a novel in paragraph form. For example, we're told early on that a character has a sparkling wit, and 200 pages on I'm still looking for an example of that wit. There's only sparse dialog here, and what little dialog is very stilted. It's all completely lifeless. Cardboard characters would be a step up from the depth on display here."
3,Intricately detailed.............,"I purchased this book hoping to further understand the reign of James IV of Scotland and the events that led up to Flodden Field. Norman MacDougall certainly provides this information in, what is often, excruciating detail. Mainly focusing on government operation, political in-fighting, and clan rivalries of late 15th and early 16th centuries, MacDougall throws a plethora of Scottish earls, bishops, and burghers into the mix and the reader is highly challenged to keep it all straight. If one is looking for a leisurely read of James IV and his reign, I suggest looking elsewhere. However, if one requires an intensely detailed political account of this patricidal, fiscally obsessed, ruler who, himself, was doomed to destruction, you need look no further."
1,Junk,"I don't recommend this to anyone wanting to use it for spraying on Stucco. The first day I used it, it didn't even work right. When I put third batch of mud I put in it got jammed up. The needle valve had gotten stucco in it and it wouldn't spray. The fourth batch was fine but on the fifth batch it messed up again. This time it was getting air but it wouldn't spray the stucco. I only tried it on stucco so I don't know how it would do on the other things it claims that it is able to do. So my advice is to save your money until they improve on their gun."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this device thinking that since it was made by a reputable company, it had to be good. The concept of the gun & hopper is great except that the concept here does not work. I've mixed various materials of different viscosities and they all fail to gravitate to the lower portion of the hopper into the gun. The spring-loaded piston like lid is designed to 'push' the material into the gun, only it doesn't do the job either. The various orfices are difficult to load into the gun as well. On a positive note, the best feature on this gun is the air control is located on the gun handle as opposed to being on the air compressor. I'm getting rid of my 13602 and going back to the conventional gravity-fed hopper."
5,Another View of a Symphonic Master,"Rubbra is best known for his eleven wonderful symphonies, but his work is grounded in Elizabethan counterpoint and the great English madrigalists.This excellent set gives one a chance to hear his compositional style stripped own to its essentials. It also shows that Rubbra's chamber output belongs in the great seventeenth century tradition of Locke, Lawes, and Jenkins: work which while melodic demands considerable intellectual involvement from the listener. Highly recommended for those who care for 20th century English music--particularly its lamentably neglected chamber tradition."
2,From Back Cover,"When Courtney places a personal ad in Attitudes, seeking a valentine for her older sister, a fellow classmate by the name of Jeff responds. These high school seniors are determined their elder siblings will put personal relations ahead of work. And if they have to say they are getting married to achieve the desired response, then that's just what they will do.Jeff's brother has life all planned out for him, believing his younger ex-step brother should follow in his footsteps. Likewise, Brook refuses to allow her younger sister to follow her dream of attending acting school. So Jeff and Brook decide that if they can get their elder siblings dating, they might gain more control over their lives and their plans for the future. But when a casual introduction becomes impossible, Jeff and Courtney announce they are getting married, bringing Brook and Chase into tremendous conflict.From The Personal Touch series"
4,One of the best books on war time leadership,"I found this book to be one of the best books about command decisions and relationships between Politicians and generals during the Civil War I have ever read. It covers the battles and the leaders of the Confederacy, both great and flawed. I found it hard to believe that some Southern leaders/generals fought harder against their own side in stupid little infights and disputes. The book goes a long way in explaining Lee's strategy and that of Davis and how they were different and the results of that difference. This book concentrates on the Eastern Theatre, the author's other book 'Jefferson Davis and his Generals' covers the Western Theatre of operations and is brillant in its examination of this area. Both books are well worth reading."
3,If you like your leading men mean...,"This might be your type of romance. However, I found Marsh to be way too punishing. The writing is fast-paced, the love scenes sizzling, the mystery compelling. However, I found Sarah's attraction to him slightly dimwitted, because he was verbally cruel. I will say that Benel's writing is worth another look. She hooked me with her ability to move the story."
2,Cheaply made,"I'm surprised by the other reviews.I have bought several mega bloks toys for my children. They look great. They should be a lot of fun to make but the quality is really poor. The pieces do not fit together properly. Its really a shame they didn't manufacture them correctly. The children were so frustrated by trying to fit together one piece only to have all their hard work collapse. We have had this problem with the FDNY Firetruck, the P-51 Mustang and this Tactical Fighter.The instructions could also be a little clearer (especially for the Firetruck)."
2,"Lots of good information. Very dry content, cumbersome word choices","Rather dry, over-use of large cumbersome words in some areas. Grammar error on page 51, second paragraph. I'm glad it was cheap."
2,EXTREMELY narrow,This is a beautiful shoe and well made. Unfortunately it's also way too narrow even if broken in...They kill me just to try them on. I'm a true 8 and have never needed a wider shoe. What a shame. I really would have enjoyed these.
2,Kicking mogwai,"Well this is not a complete disaster, but taking any amazing bands material and playing with them will rarely even do justice to the originals, let alone emulate them..It is nice to see some of their older lo-fi material get a nice cover of sparkling sheen on top with the reinturpeted tracks..Unfortunately it is always the original brilliance of the writing, not the re-worked beat placements, that fans will appreciate.."
1,A 5 minute wonder.,This machine had great potential-if only it wouldn't shut itself off after playing for 5 minutes. Maybe I just got a lemon but buyer beware.
2,Usability problems,"You would think that for an expensive player, they would spend a little effort making sure the thing was easy to use. First, to even get it to play using the HDMI cable, you initially have to hook it up to your display using component cables, go into the DVD menu, adjust its output to HDMI, and then hook up the HDMI connection. Otherwise you just get a blank screen. It took me hours to figure out because the manual didn't say anything about it. Second, the tray that holds the DVDs is horrid - the sides have no cutout, so it is tricky to take the disks out. And the HDMI output is always stretched to widescreen - which is terrible because many of my DVDs are 4:3 TV series. It's hooked up using component cables right now (which look as good as HDMI anyway).The player also has the neat feature of pausing or even crashing at the most exciting parts of movies. I'm sure it took some brilliant engineering on Toshiba's part to pull off."
4,Toshiba HDMI DVD player,"This is a nice DVD player and it includes a HDMI cable, which is really nice since they cost 20+ bucks. Anyways only thing holding this player back from being great, it doesnt play ALL dvds, it plays most of them. I have come accross a few that it wont play and it is disappointing because my cheap mintek player plays them all. I just dont understand why they cant make a player play all formats. It is a beautiful player"
4,Replacement caps,The caps arrived as promised and have performed as promised. They were welcome replacements for caps that had cracked and broken after several years of use. They are just as promised.
1,the ron white show,"i was very dissappointed when i watched this dvd. it was only 22 minutes long and it totally sucked. i would not recommend this to dvd to larry the cable guy, jeff foxworthy,or even bill ingalls. sorry guys!"
5,Those memories,I used to play a couple of Shakatak tracks in a covers band in the 80's. This CD gave me copies of those songs that I had never owned. They sound just a great after all these years.
2,dont buy this,"here we are christmas morning, putting together this mega set ..here we are christmas night, putting together this mega set..everytime we put a new piece on - one falls off - can't wait to returns this tomorrow!"
3,Needs Improvement,"Our family own a ton of Lego and quite a few Mega Bloks sets. We have come to the conclusion that the two companies need to pool their talents: Lego's quality and Mega Bloks' creativity.I just spent the last few hours skinning my knuckles trying to get the pieces of this fortress put together for my son. He's content to spend hours battling with the 2 dragons (which have held up admirably under the strain), while I do all the work. And work it is! The pieces simply do not connect well enough without using significant amounts of elbow grease.Having said that, the design is good-looking and fun to play around. Unlike Lego, the Mega Bloks pieces have modeling and texture. But also unlike Lego, they do not connect well. Sort of important in a construction toy..."
1,a wrong info!!!!,"don't buy this cd!!! this is not QUANNUM!! this ia KWYSHIA COLE's cd. i baught this via a seller. but i got worng cd. my seller answer me with this mail.I apologize if you received an incorrect item.

1,Missing Close Captioning,Since my hearing is pretty bad - even with hearing aids - I depend on sub-titles and/or close captioning. This DVD was described as having CC but it didn't so I could not understand the dialog.
2,You'll survive just fine without it!,"King Lear was fine, but I don't want to see it again. The acting was okay, nobody stood out or struck me as having great talent; the weren't terrible. I think the set and costume were a little to boring, I would expect a little more extravagence, being that he was a king. Maybe they did it to keep the focus on the dialogue because they were speaking in the shakespearian language. However, the dialogue was still hard to follow. The diction of the actors wasn't to great. Either they were yelling making it hard to understand, or they were mumbling.Kent was probablly the best casted actor in the movie, and the easiest to understand. I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie, and I don't want to see it again."
3,What was William Shakespeare on!,"I thought the movie of King Lear was an okay film. Though the play's production and set seemed cheaped,the acting caught my attention. However, my perception of some of the characters appearances within the book completely surprised me. I would have preferred King Lear to be muchmore taller. Cordelia could have been more attractive(Cordelia resembled Micheal Jackson). Edgar seemed like he should have been the better looking than Edmund and much more stronger. The productionwasn't superb at all! Yet considering it was a play, the setting worked. Overall, the movie got Shakespeare's point across well, but I wouldn't have paid anything to watch this film in a local theatre."
3,Screaming and Mumbling,"I did not really enjoy this version of King Lear. It bothered me that the set stayed the same for almost the entire movie. Though this may have contributed to the audience focusing more on the action, it disturbed me that when it started raining, the actors looked like they were still inside. I thought the actors screamed all too much, and when they were not screaming, they were mumbling. This made it hard for me to take the characters seriously because it was hard to understand them. Also, the actors who played Edgar and Cordelia came off as a little too dramatic and soft. Edgar acted like a pansy throughout the play, and Cordelia did not act as strong as I pictured her when I first read the play. Overall, I believe that BBC could have done a better job with what they had."
2,Read it. Don't watch it.,"This movie was acceptable lighting and staging wise, but the costumes seemed to be a strange mixture of different time periods. At the beginning, Lear's attendants looked like a S.W.A.T. team, and at the end of the play Edger, who'd already had far too many costume changes, was dressed as an executioner. The actors screamed and mumbled their lines, which may have distracted them for focusing on more important things, like being believable characters and staying true to the play. All the actors had their moments when they seemed to show the appropriate level of accuracy to the characters, but that was usually when they weren't speaking. All in all, if it were a real movie, I would have waited for it to come out on HBO, and even then, I might have only viewed it while something more interesting was on a commercial break."
1,Awesome idea if it worked,"The bag fell off on it's maiden voyage and I lost my repair kit and tool. I'm attempting to get another one from the manufacturer, but it'll have a back-up strap in place."
5,Excellent for Fizik Saddles,"Well constructed, water resistant, clips in very securely to a Fizik saddle. It would be nice if this was made one size larger...two tubes, CO2 and a multitool makes for a tight squeeze. Light strap on the back of the saddle is very handy and the reflective :K on each side of the saddle bag are an added level of safety. Overall rating would be an A, have used Bontrager saddle bags before buying this saddle bag, I would say that the quality of this is superior to any of the Bontrager saddle bags that I have used before"
1,"Opinion on shipping is HORRIBLE! STAY AWAY from AMAZON!!! Book is great, though.","I ordered this book for a class I had, had to study on it.I ordered it on 8/23/2007 paying to have it shipped next day, the seller is NOT an amazon merchant but AMAZON itself!I never received it, I had to call and re-order it in order to get it.I received it in the middle of September!The book itself is very nice and user friendly with a lot of exercises to let you practice what you study in the chapter. It is very well designed and it lets you really understand Photoshop for the web.The only problem with it was AMAZON did NOT honor the original purchase nor the shipping!"
1,worst book I ever read,"This is by far the worst book I ever read. The author didnt even use quotation marks so half the time you didnt know when the characters were talking or which ones were talking. The story didnt flow well at all, the sentences were typed wrong and all jacked up, and basically it took 228 pages to stretch out a story about her meeting the guy Cameron, staying at his grandmas house and than running away and getting shot all of a sudden in the end.... This book was awful!!! The story didnt flow well at all and I finished it in 3 hours. This book gets an F!"
5,A Timeless Classic,"This is such a great movie, but the dvd is really not too good. Like many other great older movies, the studio has not given this movie the proper dvd transfer that it diserves."
5,A WARM LIGHT-HEARTED COMEDY ONE OF THE BEST,I saw TWINS with ARNOLD SCHWARTZENEGGER and DANNY DEVITO and liked it a lot. There is a lot of funny moments in this film wait till you hear SCHWARTZENEGGER singing what he's singing I'm not giving away but you'll laugh also DANNY DEVITO is great as SCHWARTZENEGGER'S twin some of the situation's they get themslevs into will make you laugh yourself silly I won't give them away but you'll see what I mean. This would be a good family film I feel anyway for children and adults alike. It is enjoyable and warm heart'ed and you'll have a good time I know I did.
2,Over-rated 80's Comedy,"I've never understood the appeal of this film. So Schwarzenegger is in a comedy...yes, I suppose at one time that was a novel concept. But it's just not very funny. The highlight for me was a shot of Arnold's face after a sexual encounter. Aside from that, DeVito does a good job playing a slimeball, with some good lines and a rather funny scene where he is supposed to be running away from the bad guys...but due to his tiny legs and the suitcase he's carrying, he can do little more than waddle.I just can't recommend it. It's really light-weight fare. If you want to see a REALLY funny Schwarzenegger movie, see ""True Lies"". That is definitely a classic."
4,Twins,I thoroughly enjoyed watching this Dvd. It was very funny and entertaining. I watch it over and over.
2,Not that great...,"I purchased this workout dvd a while back and was really disappointed...I am an intermediate-level exerciser and this workout really didn't get my heart rate up as much as I'd have liked. Also, the choreography seemed awkward at times, at least to me. In addition, this was bad on my knees. Don't get me wrong, it's very low-impact, but there are a few twisting dance movements that caused some discomfort and just didn't feel ""right"". As for the pilates workout, it was pretty good...but not enough to warrant more than 2 stars, since the main workout was so awful."
5,This CD is CALIENTE!,"I stumbled onto this CD by accident at one of those ""listening stations"" in the store. I meant to listen to another CD and hit the wrong button--a fortunate accident for me! I love every song on this album. ""Escuchame"" was not terribly impressive the first time I listened to the album, but it grew on me. All of the other songs were instant hits with me. The rhythms are guaranteed to make you move, and the horn section is terrific. Polished vocals add to the quality of the album. Definitely a fun and modern-sounding introduction to merengue. I will not be able to resist buying more of their albums. Beg, buy, or borrow this CD--you won't be sorry!"
3,"Good, but salty","This is easy and quick to make and a life saver if you are short on time. I would add more vegtables to make it a main meal, not a side. The downside is the high sodium content. It's pretty high plus you can really taste it when you eat it - you really need to add something to it to make it less salty or use only half of the spice bag it comes with. Of course then you don't get as many dried tomatoes either. But, for your health and taste buds sake, you need to do something to bring down the salt."
3,"Just because it looks right, doesn't mean it is right...","I bought this figure mainly because she had a cape, rope and the sword. I bought it at a comic book shop. The cape doesn't move freely, it's made of rubber. The sword is a little too thin. The rope is nearly fragile. You gotta handle that part carefully. And finally...her shape...you're better off with a different Wonder Woman and be satisfied with it. Unless you want to spend extra for the cape and sword, then by all means go ahead."
2,Bum unit compared to older models,"I bought a Toshiba DVD player a couple years ago and it's been working out great so I bought this new, slim, and inexpensive player figuring I'ld have the same luck. Playback is nice when it works but I keep having problems with the player not responding to the remote control. The new remote and the old one work with the older player but don't work with this new player. Well, some times it decides to work but mostly it doesn't. Maybe it will work with a Universal remote but this has been a headache for us lately and disappointing compared to the solid older Toshiba player."
1,Toshiba DVD player SD-3980-su2 sucks,"I found this page of reviews for the Toshiba DVD player SD-3980-SU2 and thought I would add my own review, even though it's an older product. My Toshiba DVD player died after playing about 20 movies. The DVD player will not load the DVDs and then gives a message that the DVD is an incorrect disk. Who knew that all of the movies were printed on incorrect DVD,s?I searched online for ways to fix the DVD player. I ran across several sites that said ""Toshiba will replace the product IF AND ONLY IF it has a SU2 at the end of its product number"" and ""Call Tech Support at 1-800-631-3811 to get a replacement DVD player"". I don't know where these folks found this information but it isn't accurate. I called Toshiba and asked about replacement of my DVD player. I was told Toshiba does not/did not replace failed players with that model number.I will never purchase another Toshiba product based on the performance of this DVD player."
1,It didn't last,"I received a Toshiba SD-3980-SU2 DVD player for Christmas 2005. I rarely used it. It died suddenly on 1/22/08 while playing a DVD. Now I get ""bad"" and ""Incorrect Disc"" messages whenever I try to load a CD or DVD. I can't even get the CD/DVD lens cleaner CD I bought (which someone recommended trying) to load and run.I just Googled my model and found a note for Owners of Toshiba SD-3980 and SD-K750 DVD players saying that units ending in -SU2 may stop playing discs due to a component part failure. It says to call Toshiba at 1-800-631-3811 for information on how to obtain a replacement unit."
3,Mysteries of the Ancient World,"I bought this for use in science class, but it is not appropriate. It covers mostly religious relics, and 50% is on shroud of Turin. It is great for the lay person. Would be interesting for an adult Sunday school."
2,Reader's Digest Bible,"Cohen has essentially edited the bible to a reader's digest type form. This does make it easy to read all the best-known bible stories quickly, but it also robs the bible of most of its granduer, poetry, force, and chill-producing effect. Just take the time to read the real thing instead."
5,JPeplinski on ID Theft-The Michelle Brown Story,"I used this in my financial math class. The fact that it was a true story (per hollywood) made it a great lesson on identity theft for my senior who are ready to head into the ""real world""."
5,very eye opening book,"to me nothing hits harder than Race in America. no matter what anyone says or trys to downplay or run away from, its the topic that will always be apart of us for obvious reasons. and I applaud the author for making people think out loud and from within the what ifs and how this or that. bottom line its a subject than so many folks walk around in a circle about and yet its talked about however in coded terms and words. at least with this book you get some incredible situations and how things might be and preceptions. it makes you think and digest so much and that alone makes this a compelling read and a Journey within a journey."
3,"wanna play ""What if?""","This is a very interesting and engaging book. The book is a collection of fictionalized, race themed, stories that challenge common beliefs about race. For instance, what if there were an Atlantis style utopia that only African Americans could live? What would be the reactions of whites? Would whites be glad to be rid of the 'black problem'? Would blacks want to leave the US to populate the utopian society? Bell takes an interesting and unexpected approach to this idea. Overall a good read that stimulates fresh approaches to race relations."
5,Soler,"Read my other review of Soler Quintets 1,2, 3. Both are quite wonderful and equally beautiful. I did purchase Nos. 4,5,6 first after having read a good review of them-but find both recordings to be of very good quality in every way."
2,Be a Happier Camper,This bag's not the best. Get item # CBSSUNV directly from Camp Chef for 23.99 + S&H. Fits all CC Sport Utility models.
5,Perfect fit.,"Bought 2 stoves, on sale, at the end of the summer season but could not find carrying bags for them. Everyone was out. Found these here, for less. Work great. Nice and strong. Can use them as covers at night when everything is covered by dew. Very happy with them."
4,"Superhuman pianism, but human Scriabin...","Hamelin's piano technique and quality of pianism is absolutely unbelievable. Just watch the japanese documentary ""supervirtuoso"" - you wont believe this guy's mastery of the instrument. In a ""greatest technique"" argument with people claiming for Pollini, Horowitz, Volodos or whatever, just pull out a Hamelin recording - and the argument is over. Also his choice of interesting rarely-played composers is admirable.In my opinion though, the Scriabin performances are not in the league of the Russian school recordings. Scriabin's complex music takes a musician of genius to play, and paranormal technique is not enough here. Hamelin of course is a great musician, but this recording is only good as an intruduction or for novice- Scriabinites. If you want to hear serious Scriabin listen to Sofronitsky (3,4,5,8,9), Horowitz (3!,9,10), Sokolov (3!,9!!!) and also Zhukov has a great recording of #9."
1,Did we read the same book???,"I don't think that these other reviewers and I read the same book because is one of the worst books that I have read in a looong time. I am a huge book lover and I finished this book only for the sake of the fact that I spent my money for it. If you really think you need to read it borrow it because this is one that no one will mind getting rid of. Her other two books were decent, I especially liked her first one(Those were pretty unrealistic also but better than this). This is just so unrealistic and happy go lucky that it is comical, even Walt Disney himself would have to laugh. A huge boring fairy tale, you'd be better off reading Cinderella. I am sorry but you will never see this one on the big screen. If you really need to read I am willing to part with mine because I will never read it again."
1,BORING,This book was so boring. There was no drama and the author kept repeating the same thing over and over again. And I was so sick and tired of hearing about how beautiful someone was because of how light they were. A truly terrible book.
4,"4 for 3 DEAL, ONLY $9.99","Got this during the 4 for 3 deal. So, got 8 mugs (4 sets) for only $30. Great Deal."
5,Large coffe mugs at a very good price,I use these everyday for my morning latte. They hold plenty of liquid and look very nice. They're easy to clean & seem very sturdy.
5,Love these mugs,"Nice addition to the kitchen. I use one every morning for my tea. Great for cereal, popcorn, ice cream bowls for the grandkids. I'd definitely buy these again. You can't beat the price for good quality mugs/bowls like these."
2,After one week top no longer attached.,When my husband put this together he knew the design was flawed and likely to not stay attached. Sure enough less than a week later our son called to ask if my husband thought he could repair it. We arrived a few days later with glue and some product my husband had to fill holes to help hold fasteners in place. Our two year old grandson enjoyed watching him fix it. We're now one week out from repair and it seems to be holding. If not for my husbands expertise I would have had to return it. We still might if this repair doesn't hold. The set is very cute and our grandson seems to enjoy it when it's holding.
4,My grandson loves it.,"We bought this for our grandson, and my husband assembled it. The wood is very nicely painted or stained, and it is of good quality. However, my husband needed to glue the table top to the base as the hardware provided did not work. After it was glued it was a very sturdy table."
1,PS2 to USB Converter,Bought product to convert PS2 mouse to USB. Product did not work. If there are additional drivers needed they were not supplied. Purchase is a waste of money.
2,Very Early Work,"This collection includes the very best tracks from the very early period T Rex, before they made the breakthrough in about 1970 and when they were still caught in the hippy-mythology thing, long before their megahit Hot Love. It is fairly interesting British folk-rock from the late 1960s but I think the title is somewhat misleading. The only tracks that really stand out are Debora, Child star and Salamanda Palganda,. Skip this one and get one of the complation that includes Hot Love and Get It On (Bang A Gong)."
5,Awesome,"It's Zakk Wylde, what more do I need to say? He rocks. Bought this because I wore out my first copy."
5,another great album from a great band,"as far as black label soceity/zakk wylde goes it's honest straight bare to the bone heavy rock and roll.For this album it's more perfected lets say refined even though theres a guest vocal by ozzy on stillborn which is a great song.But hey with or without ozzy zakk is still holding down the forte and he is the greatest and most influential guiterist around along with iommi,rhoads.van halen ,dimebag and hendrix etc........."
4,Good,"It's a good album, has many highlights, all BLS discs are good, this one didnt get a 5 cuz it doesnt live up to 1919. but it is still a good cd."
1,"Hah, Hah, had to bring in Ozzy to sell some copies","First, I like Zakk's guitar playing. Just wish he put together a decent band to record with. Get James Lomenzo to play bass and add a good drummer. With this release still the same bad drummer and Zakk playing everything else. The only bright spot is stillborn with Ozzy singing. Ozzy makes the song stand out from the rest and would fit better on a Ozzy disc than on this very lame Hellride. I don't like the style he's singing in, but his playing great and with a decent band it would be better. I would recommend, Pride and Glory S/T debut, his Book Of Shadows releases before this. Also pick up both the first L.A. Blues Authority release and the first Guitars That Rulled The World release. They both have a song on them with Zakk playing with James Lomenzo on bass and Greg D'Angelo on Drums. Well worth checking out."
5,PT 1183,"OEM specific, exact fit, just have to splice into old wiring with butt connectors. Just make sure if this part has not been replaced on your vehicle before, if it has, pull it apart at the old splice, as to not have two splices in the line so there is no voltage drop. Worked great."
5,Absolutely a must to read for all women as well as men!,"Ah, what a great book! Being involved in Relationship Workshops, I feel this book is absolutely a must to read by women as well as men. It certainly offers insight into the world of men who listen but have found it difficult to feel. Women you must read this book! It will give you a greater understanding of men. I will indeed suggest reading it at my Relationship Workshops. Pattimari Sheets"
5,Stock up on Stocking up!,"Stocking Up III: The All-New Edition of America's Classic Preserving GuideIn today's economy, It's time to learn how to grow your own food, and make it keep till the next growing season. Your grandparents had victory gardens, we need survival gardens. This book covers what to preserve, and how to do it. It's a primary survival guide."
2,"Strong fishy taste, NO strawberry.","I purchased these at GNC and tried one before giving it to my son. As soon as I opened the bottle, I could smell the fish odor. I tried one anyway, and there was no strawberry taste that I could detect at all. Just an explosion of fish oil. Blech! Thankfully, GNC takes everything back w/in 30 days, even if opened. I returned them the next day and got GNC's chewable omega-3. Tastes MUCH better, like orange Starburst.In their defense, the NN Children's DHA supplements are very tiny. So if your child can swallow them whole, great. But as for chewing them... yuck!"
4,Good product,"My 4 and 7 year olds like to take their softgels so the taste must be good to them. I tasted one and thought that it was a bit on the yucky side, but not horrible. I didn't realize that the standard dose is 4 softgels, so there aren't nearly as many doses in the bottle as I'd thought."
5,"Taste nice, even to me!","My daughter has been eating these since she was 1 1/2, and really likes them. she would eat the whole bottle if i let her. I tried them myself, and surprised at how pleasent they tasted. A nice strawberry flavor, and the fish oil seems fresh, high quality, because it really has just a trace ""fishy"" taste, but not in a bad way. And i do NOT eat fish- it's the one food I am picky about, so I must admit I am very sensitive to anything tasting very fishy. I would buy these myself but they are a tad expensive. I give them to my now 3 year old when she won't go for a straight up spoonful of fish oil (which is by far the most economical). I highly recommend!Nordic Naturals really is the gold standard of fish oils :)"
2,my son hates them,"on the first attempt he spat them out he will not take them and i won't force him to again i even tried to make taking it more pleasant by having him chew them with gummie vitamins but he still gags i dont think its the taste so much as the capsule texture itself, he keeps chewing and chewing and they r going nowhere fast...if your child like its then it may be a good buy but for me personally a waste of money....he has now taken to chewing my dha gummie one a day vitamins he likes those better and as it turns out its approved for 6 year olds and are working great on him"
2,My son did not like taste,"I chose two stars because my son does not like the taste, that is strawberry flavor. I would suggest only purchasing this if your child can swallow pills."
5,Excellent,"Herrick plays the richly sonorous Metzler Organ of the Stadtkirche, Rheinfelden in Switzerland with performances throughout that are clear, articulate, and engaging--qualities that help make this an outstanding CD."
4,I like it's looks!,"This is the first hoodshield I've ever purchased and installed. The shield didn't have the two-sided tape on it as described, so I had to use the two included screws to attach it to the hood. One side didn't look even with the other after installation so I had to remove one screw and reposition it. The grill is attached to the hood, and had to be removed for installation. A word of caution: WHEN RE-INSTALLING THE GRILL, DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN THE NUTS. I now have indentions on the grill where the bolts are, and they are now permenant! Luckily they don't show too bad.....Overall the chrome helps dress up the looks of the front end. I'm glad I chose the chrome over the smoked finish."
4,Coma,"""Coma"" should be listed as one of the best and most creative songs ever written. I don't get it, why did she disappear? I'd be her biggest fan if she ever makes a comeback. This is such a great album, she's up there with Fiona Apple."
2,Shipswreck of the Caribbean,"Disapointing, it is not about the Carribbean only about the some of the islands especialy the English speaking islands.The spanish, french and dutch speaking islands are not in it."
4,"Good, but not the best","The third disc from Body & Soul, currently NYC's reigning House party, is a fine collection of tracks, although not quite up to par, given discs 1 & 2. Regardless, buy it and live it. No way to describe the (non-drug induced) ecstasy these guys can induce. You've got to feel it. The discs will help. Just make sure your stereo will handle extremely high volumes. You'll need it."
3,Well made but SMALL,"I ordered a large which should normally fit my head, but instead it went to my 7 year old who it fits perfectly, so ordering the next size up is recommended for this CHOCOLATE fitted cap by TWINZ."
5,Oh Yeah,"Personally I think the song Jamaican Ska, Sucks. Usually it is a red flag telling you that you are buying a poorly made two tone ska, reggae album. If you love ska you want this, it is mostly ska and good ska, if you dont have any of these songs, get this album. Buy It cheap folks dont get scammed by these inflated prices on reggae music."
4,Life is a journey,Eric's work is a wonderful journal of a few precious segments down the road of his life. I would recommend this entertaining book to all those of us who love the journey of our lives.
2,Careful - very academic read,"I'm not an academic but an avid reader who wanted an interesting, informative biography on Woodrow Wilson. This is really a text-book pretending to be a biogrpaphy and it took much patience and persistence to finish the book because it didn't really hold my attention. I love non fiction but not really esoteric or abstruse works, and I found this book overly academic and a bit boring."
4,A surprisingly Good Book,"Alright, I had to give this book four stars despite the painfulness of reading it. In fact, the only thing keeping it from a five is the memory of that torture (if that makes any sense). I gritted my teeth for the entire first three quarters of the novel but when I finally started in and read it straight through I truly appreciated it. It is a well written novel that I am glad I was forced to read. I recommend it to anyone who wants to get inside the mind of the Soviet system. I'll never forget this book and while I don't know that I would like to read more Soviet Realism, the cinematice style of Kataev has something to be said for it."
1,Couldn't finish,"This book was about a couple who had made some silly promise seven years ago to get married. For some reason, Ginny decided she was going to wait for Tucker to return. Even when she heard he was engaged, she waited.Tucker seemed like a weak, indecisive person. The way they felt, their faith, and their wants seemed to bounce around. The author didn't really focus on anything long enough for me to become emotionally involved. I felt that the story was only half there with a lot of holes. It felt disorganized, and the issues felt really silly..."
1,Deficient,It won't play on any CD player in the house. I'm disappointed. I'm not going to bother to return it. It's not worth my time.
5,Sturgeon Ancestry,As a descendant of the Sturgeon's I found the book to be quite interesting and helpful in researching my family history.
4,Excellant book for therapists and survivors of sexual abuse.,An excellant book for both therapists and survivors of childhood sexual abuse. The information is presented in a very sensitive fashion that is less likely to evoke a strong negative effect in survivors. It invites the reader to explore the devastating effects of sexual abuse at their own speed. The author reiterates the importance of self care and support throughout the healing process and gives many suggestions as to how to do this in healthy manner. A fine and gentle introduction to a troubling subject.
2,B17,"These jeans are B17,s. The description states they fit at the natural waist. Not so, check Carhartt's web site and B17's are described as fitting slightly below the waist line. Plus, the waist size runs way small. I ordered 35"" waist and the waist was more like 32"" or 33"". Had to return. However, Carhartt B13 does fit at the natural waist. I am a Carhartt fan. I wear B151's everyday to school and they work great. Sometimes sizes may run a little inconsistent."
2,Not a good fit,"Can't seem to find Wrangler Riggs in 28"" length, so tried these for work. Seems like nice weight for work jeans. The jeans were short in the crotch. They were uncomfortable and they also rode up in the seat of the pants. Returned them."
4,Good price for carhartt,Good price and size selection on carhartt jeans. They fit good and have the quality you would expect from carhartt.
2,"It is tight fit, not relaxed fit at all","I bought it primarily because it is claiming to be relaxed fit and high ratings from previous buyers. It is really a very tight fit, so tight that it chokes my manhood when sit down. It is pretty cool when you stand with it, as it makes your behind look slim.It is probably can be considered relaxed fit by women's standard. But for working men, it is too tight to be comfortable in my view, unless you are super skinny.I do like the zipper though, very easy to pull the zipper. And it does not unzip by itself, as some previous buyers said, as far as I can tell. Some other jeans are hard to zip.Best wishes to you all."
4,Nice for hard to fit sizes,"I wear a size 38x28, so it's hard to find jeans that fit me. These fit the job and seem to be ruggedly constructed. Even the zipper is sturdy. They were BLUE jeans though - they probably need a half dozen runs through the washer to get that broken in feel.The fit is very close to a pair of Arizona relaxed fit jeans I have, with the exception that the waist is a little bit tighter. The cut is close in other respects, though.The only other negative thing I can think of is the styling. The Carhartt logo on the back pocket is in an odd place. I'm not sure yet if I will relegate these to work around the house jeans as opposed to wearing them into the office, but it's nice to at least get a pair that fits."
5,Burton Spiller - Poet Laureate,"Burton Spiller is the ""Poet Laureate"" for all of us upland bird hunters. His style is superb and his love and understanding of Bonasa Umbellus (Ruffed Grouse) is without peer. It is easy to walk the uplands and smell the fall woods behind a fine pointing dog as you ease back and peruse this masters writing. This book completes my collection of his remaining printed works. I was thrilled to receive it! It arrived in excellent condition and on time. Nice Job!"
5,Great first book in the series!,"I've read some other books by Robin Jones Gunn, and this one definitely did not disappoint! I had a hard time putting it down, as it pulled me in. I was happy to see that this is part of a series, as I love reading book series.The characters were so believable that I felt like they could live next door. Loved how Ms. Gunn kept you in suspense, as to the secret that Jessica is hiding. With Jessica's financial struggles in the beginning, it made me think of those that are presently struggling financially now. What I particularly loved even more than the suspense was the redeeming love of our Saviour, and how He heals our past and gives us a bright future.I have handed this one to my teen daughter as I know she will enjoy it as much as I do.This book was provided for review by Waterbrook Multnomah."
4,Very good!,"I don't often read plain Christian fiction. Usually because it's so hit or miss with me, and I can't tell exactly what it is that will make me like or dislike a book. I don't know if it's my mood or writing style or what. Luckily, this one was a hit. It was very easy to read, the story moved along quite smoothly, and it just felt like a nice, cozy read.The characters were interesting, although the big ""secret"" that the main character was carrying throughout the book turned out to be not so big. I was waiting for some big shocking reveal, and it never came. But the story in itself was sweet, and the romance was nice and clean.This book would probably only appeal to Christian readers, as it is fairly heavy on the religion, but I would recommend it to fans of Karen Kingsbury. The style felt similar.This review is part of the Value Fiction Blog tour for WaterBrook Multnomah Publishers."
5,Amazing what a new blade can do,"Replaced our old (5-10 year) chopping blade on our mini Cuisinart when we were replacing blade and a disc on our large one (15+ years old). WOW! What a difference? Recommend changing every few years, if used heavily. Shallots, garlic, parsley, cilantro are all nicely chopped and no longer simply shredded."
4,Get to know your puppy!,"This is a great beginner's book to getting a puppy - excellent for before the puppy comes to his furever home. There are great tips in here that although slightly obvious are great to remember...like telling your kids not to run or yell because the puppy will think it's play/nip time and get overly excited. I especially like the paragraphs interspersed among the chapters that explain a particular situation, such as having a desigated place for kids toys where the puppy can't get to them."
3,"Decent text, Skip the video","Although Travessia provides a well-designed introduction to Portuguese by providing beginner vocabulary on an appropriately broad number of subjects as well as a casual, unintimidating approach to the grammar, one should beware the accompanying videos which are HORRIBLE. The producers should be ashamed to have realeased such amateur quality skits the background music of which often drowns out the speakers themselves. These videos are an embarrasment to Brasil and its people. The one saving grace of the first video is a performace by Joao Gilberto of ""Canta Brasil"" which reminds us why we are learning the language in the first place, and allows us to forgive, for a moment, the rest of the atrocity."
5,"UPLIFTING, INSPIRING...YES I CAN GO ON!","Cracking the Parenting Code: 6 Clues to Solving the Mystery of Meeting Your Child's NeedsEncouraging and hope-filled is how I feel after reading this book. The combination of the two authors inspired me. I recommend this to all hurting women who are burned out and discouraged! Love it, love it, love it!"
5,Self - He;p and Monivating,Used it to teach a Women's Bible Study in a Domestic Violence Shelter. The book contains appropriate scripture for Self-help and motivational.
3,open your ears and listen with all your might!,"I have finally found the Rainforest Mix of ""GO"" - its the best track on the entire CD... if you are use to listening to early rave then this track is a must have, enough said buy this album just for the ""GO"" mixes!"
4,Early '80s AOR classic,"Canadian AOR group Sheriff released their self-titled debut album in 1982. Featuring the smooth and powerful vocals of Freddy Curci, Sheriff's sound was pretty typical of the post-disco, pre-hair metal AOR scene. It was very accessible, very melodic, very radio-friendly lite rock along the lines of Balance, Touch, REO Speedwagon and Toto. The songs are fairly upbeat, not too rocking, and tend to focus on love-inspired lyrics. The album featured the major radio hit in the ultra-sappy ballad ""When I'm With You.""Despite the success of ""When I'm With You,"" Sheriff didn't last long. This was their only album, though some of the band members (including Curci) went on to some success inAlias. If you're looking for something that rocks, this really isn't it. If you're a fan of lighter-edged AOR bands, you'll want to check this album out, even though it does have one of the worst album covers ever."
5,Outstanding - Must read if you want facts and not hype,"I have long been one of those people who wondered why solar energy didn't take off. Now I know.This book is an excellent primer on the realities of energy, and energy conversion. This was ther first book I have read on the subject that took the time to convert units of energy into common terms so I could compare wind energy to a gasoline engine. It is amazing how the facts become evident when the vocabulary (read units of measurement) is consistent."
2,WHATS UP WITH MR.DEVITO,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY .NEW MUSIC WITH OLD ,OLD MUSICVERY BAD, GET NYC UNDERGROUND VOL.5 MUCH BETTER"
4,"Good anchor, smooth and as described.","Despite other reviews I've had had no problems with this holding. My boat is a 15' jet boat with a tower and with the tower the wind can really move the boat. I've set the anchor a few times now and it holds pretty well. Because it's coated, it's a bit 'tight' at the joint but that's just because it's new. The coating seems thick and has no visible areas of thin spots. I like this anchor!"
5,Children's Special Days All Over the World,"There are many special days besides birthdays which are celebrated in other countries, cultures, and religions. This book talks about many of them - days of birth, days of naming, ceremonies of growing up. Each of these days is an important day in the life of that child; it is their special day. An apendix includes music of birthday songs and children's names in other parts of the world. Beautiful drawings of the events and locations are spread throughout the book."
2,Book,"I believe in honoring God's word and the Sabbath, so that was a difference of opinion. There were several other statements that I found difficult."
4,Cool,So glad I got this just before Whitney died. I got it for a great price and I so thankful to have music to sing and enjoy. So thankful.
3,Weak Alarm,"Nice looking watch. Solid. A little heavy and bulky, but I thats how I like my watches. The thing that attracted me to this watch was the vibrating alarm. If thats why you are considering this watch don't bother. I can barely feel it vibrating and if you depend on the alarm to wake you in the morning forget it. Get a regular alarm watch instead."
2,not what i was looking for,The watch is pretty heavy and the face is very big (not the numbers). I wanted my husband to have a vibrating watch alarm to wake him up in the morning without disturbing me. He says the watch only vibrates at night not in the morning. So that must mean it does not wake him up or something is not set up correctly. All he has done is complain about the watch. I wish i did not buy it.
2,Dated and anemic,"Those hoping for an attack on mob rule and Andrew Jackson will be sorely disappointed; this 'treatise on Jacksonian democracy' is hardly a commentary on the current events of Cooper's age, and does not even mention Jackson. Rather, Cooper, spends more time discussing the merits of proper pronounciation than slavery! Further, for a polemic that greatly hurt its writer's reputation, the book is pretty weak and tame."
3,Life in Christ by MLJ,"Still going through it but lots of information from a pointed point of view. If you haven't read MLJ before, its different."
4,Great CD For This Year...War...Future,"Vince Vance and the Valiants have expressed what is going on in our world very well with some words and music. Their ""We Don't Run"" and ""Bomb Iraq"" are very well done. Other tracks are very patriotic...well written. They have included a little bit of everything. I've enjoyed listening to this CD."
5,Greatest Shower Curtain Ever!!!,I've used these curtains in the past and absolutely love them. They are so easy to use and to keep clean!!!! Keep them available I wished I had ordered more!!!!
3,Hookless Vision Shower Curtain,The first shower curtain shipped to me had a hole in it. I contacted the company and they promptly sent me a new one which seems to be working fine. The size and weight of the curtain is perfect. The only bad thing is the curtain needs to be hand washed. I am use to thowing my curtains in the washer to clean them.
2,Disappointed,Very disappointed. I returned this item. It was not what I expected. Shorter than expected.The color was also off from what I saw on the internet.
1,Unreliable,"Michael Kelsey is notorious for inaccurate information. He'll review hikes he's never done, list canyon entry and exit points he's never attempted. He's all about speed. He races through areas in order to spew out his next book without actually taking the time to experience the canyons through which he's rushing. He covers a lot of ground, but sees little. I do like the pictures of him in tube socks and cut-offs, though. If you're lucky, there may even be a picture of him in beefeaters."
5,Steppin out is pure Paul Taylor,"Fantastic collection of smooth and sexy songs that only PTcan provide. ""long way home"" sweeps you from the worries of the day while the title cut ""steppin out"" provides you with toe-tappin excellence. I have all of his Cd's.... This one is my favorite ...."
2,Do not buy this smooth Jazz CD,"After ""Hypnotic"" Paul Taylor's 2001 release, I had to have this CD. It was very disappointment. Seemed almost canned. He really jammed on the other CD. This one seems like a computer programmed module with no talent. He can do much better."
2,Worthless,"I've tried these things a few times, thinking the first failure to be a fluke but now know these things to be a complete waste of money. As claimed, it will keep the cake from doming in the center. The trade off is a cake that rises so much it nearly overflows the pans, and edges that are dry and crispy before the middle gets anywhere near finished. I finally threw these away and will just go back to leveling my cakes with a knife. It's no different than having to cut off the nearly burnt crust, and I'll know the inside is actually baked to completion."
5,A Must Have for Bolin Fans,"This is a must-have CD for Bolin fans. He plays with the authority we love him for. The performances are a blast to hear, with some real surprises. I can listen to this all day while working as a web designer, just put the player on repeat and I notice new stuff each time. Don't pass this up."
5,the best,"have one and love it- gave one as a wedding present to my brother- he loves it- we are all pepper fans and this works well, looks nice and is fun-"
5,This movie is good...,"I don't know where one gets that Lou Diamond Phillips is in this, because he isn't. However the storyline is set as it is in the old myths...The bride is poisoned on her wedding day by the main character's rival and he goes into Haedes to bring her soul back. They fight ***yes Hellhounds*** and such along the way, and it does have a lot of action in it. Yes, there are gory scenes so it's not for the kiddies...If you remember the song ""Don't Pay the Ferryman"" from the '80's you will have a good idea what myth that this film originates from. The acting was well done in it, and I enjoyed seeing Ben Cross in this one. He played the part of the king well. I guess the other reviewer didn't get into it because he didn't get the plot. Those of you who are into the Greek Mythology and such will like it, I think...Rick Schroder did an excellent job directing these actors too. There was no overacting. The make up and costumes were good as well."
3,The Mysterious Deep,"I'd actually go 3 and a half stars if Amazon would let me. Despite a B movie title this book has its moments. The first half could have and should have been cut by a third to a half, because it is slow going in parts and at times over-burdened with research. The author clearly knows his stuff, but I found myself skimming parts. The characters, save one or two, are not particularly empathetic, and jarring sex talk heard through a door seems out of place. Once the book hits the second part it starts sailing with some truly eerie moments and tense situations. Some of the scenes below the surface, exploring the ghostly interior of the doomed ship, are haunting and wonderfully descriptive. The ending was a bit patched on for me, but satisfying enough."
5,First-rate,"This is a high-quality ruler with extreme attention to detail. The markings are precisely engraved, the finish is a non-glare satin, and the ends are ground precisely to the scale. Both scales on both sides are perfectly aligned to the end of the ruler."
5,Starrett Rule,"Usual Starett--pricey, but very high quality. But, when you have to trust the accuracy of your measurements, it is hard to beat Starrett"
5,Ideal for People Who Where Glasses,"I got this in the mail a few days ago and I must say... what a difference! I took off my old eyecup that came with my Olympus E-420, and slipped on the new one and it allows me to see through the viewfinder much better with my glasses. Not much else can really be said. Recommended for people w/ glasses."
3,Second One,This is the second eyepiece that I have purchased. Lost the one that came with the camera and a replacement. Talked to Olympus and did not get any real good ideas to secure the eyepiece. I used a small amount of RTV and I hope that will hold it in place.
5,Beatles' style Christmas classics,"""X'mas - The Beatmas"" by Rubber Band, a group from Sweden, recorded this Christmas songs CD by using the arrangement of the Beatles' songs. The following is the list showing the arrangement of the Beatles' songs used according to the track number.(1) Please, please me (2) Eight days a week (3) I saw her standing there (4) Please Mr. Postman (5) No reply (6) All my loving (7) Love me do (8) Taxman (9)Nowhere man (10) Ticket to ride (11) Lucy in the sky with diamonds (12) A day in the life (ending). It's genius by performing these classic Christmas songs in this refreshing way. The performance of Rubber Band is outstanding, highly recommended if you are tired of hearing the traditional Christmas songs."
3,Not Bad,"This is not a bad recording. Unfortunately, for Beatmas, I've heard the two Fab Four Christmas CD's. No contestThe Fab Four are much closer vocally and the song selections, in my mind. are more natural and it's easier to visual JOhn, Paul George and Ringo performing them.If you can pick this one up at a reasonable price, do so. Either of the Fab Four CD's are quite a bit cheaperr on Amazon Marketplace as I wriite this.Either way, Season's Greetings and enjoy!"
5,Excellent first,I've been enjoying David Nevue's work (13 albums and counting) for many years now and I am always drawn to this first CD.
3,"Yours Truly, Goldilocks","I read this book to a group of 3rd graders. It held most of their attention, but not all of it."
3,"could have been great, but ....","If all of the tracks were as excellent as 'swing lite-alright"" and ""fly hawaii"" this would have easily garnered 5 stars ,but, alas they aren't:("
4,"Playful, Imaginative, Unexpected!","I get a sly grin across my face as I pull on the headphones and let this play repeatedly over the course of a day. Who could have ever guessed that Hawaiian slide guitar would fit so naturally into the electronic landscape? The blips and bleeps and loops that Mr. Vibert has concocted are complemented wonderfully by the shimmering, mysterious and ethereal playing of Mr. Cole. When the album veers into more overt electronica mode (such as Baby Steps), it feels just a little more ordinary. But on the whole, a very magical experience!"
2,Huge dissapointment,"After reading this book, I tried to sort through all of the loose threads and realized I could weave a rug with what wasn't cleared up. While the descriptions of life on a carrier may have been accurate, the story-telling just isn't there. We are asked to suspend belief, and to believe that 8000 naval personnel would blindly follow orders without checking. As just one example, we have the carrier supposedly at EMCON (emissions control-nothing radiated), and yet crewmembers are recieving and sending e-mails. And this is just one of the minor inconsistancies. All in all a very dissapointing book. I'd reccomend reading an old Tom Clancy before you spend your cash on this one."
4,Great scrambled eggs,"I do not have this specific product but have owned another like it for many years(10+).This product, and others like it, will mix light mixtures.E.g., they do a superb job of scrambling eggs, especially for omelets, by entrenching the eggs with air to make a very fluffy egg mixture in half the time it takes to 'fork' them. Nothing I've found, short of using a mixer, will produce as smooth an egg mixture as quickly.It will not handle anything much heavier than eggs, however.(the 'spring' will bend preventing the agitation one normally gets with lighter mixtures)Immersion in warm/hot water as soon as the mixing is finished makes cleaning it very easy, however it cleans up in a dishwasher even if substance has dried on it.Do not leave it sitting in water. It will rust.Do not use it in/on a non-stick pan. It will scratch it.I give it four stars because it is nearly foolproof for what it is designed to do but have not used this specific item and it has a relatively limited use."
2,Disappointing Dryer Balls,"I was anxious to use the dryer balls since they weren't toxic and better for the environment. The first time I used them, one of them split in two! Wish I had my money back, but, oh well..."
2,Buyer Beware,This product may work but I'll never know--after two uses I found that it had dinged up my dryer's pretty stainless steel drum. Now my brand new dryer has pock-marks in it. I won't use these balls again. I also did not find my towels were any softer the 2 times I did use it.
3,It works but loud,"It definitely reduced the amount of time to dry my washed clothes, but it gets really loud in the dryer unless its full. I should have bought a couple of tennis balls..."
1,Don't feel comfortable placing this with my clothes,"These dryer balls smelled so strongly of chemical fumes - like the paint thinners I use in the studio, that I immediately got a headache. This, coupled with the fact that the packaging looked like it was printed on some color laserjet printer with several typos, was not reassuring, to say the least. That ""Made in China"" sign seemed to blare at me. I know everything is made in China these days, but what corners did they cut in the production process to have these dryer balls delivered to me smelling like they were doused in gasoline?? Not good. I went and purchased some tennis balls for less than $3 instead."
4,dryer ball review,The dryer balls appear to be helping dry and fluff up our clothes better than they were without the use of the balls. This is most apparent when washing fitted sheets and clothes together. These sheets tend to entangle smaller items and keep the heat from reaching them and drying them. We find a definite improvement in dryer performance in this case.
1,Useless Product,"Don't waste your money on this product. It does not improve dryer preformance or softness and both balls cracked after just a few uses. Oh, and they make a lot of noise too."
1,Nosiy Balls,"I can't believe no one has written about the added noise by using these balls. After two loads I am returning these balls because of the loud noise. I used to be able to run the dryer at night, but its not possible now with the dryer balls. Just imagine hard plastic balls tumbling in the dryer, well for me the additional noise was not worth it. It's very similar to putting shoes in the dryer. If you don't mind the noise then this product might work for you. For me, I prefer peace and quiet more than saving a few cents."
3,for collectors and completists only,"When this was first issued on vinyl in the early eighties it was a must-have item. Unfortunately, this release has been superseded by ""A BBC History"" (credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex and T Rex), which is not only more complete, but has far more accurate sleeve notes. For example, according to Across the Airwaves, Hot Love was first performed by Tyrannosaurus Rex in 1969.Musically, it's excellent, with the earlier tracks offering more than the later ones. Of particular interest are Misty Mist and Scenescof, which actually come from the audition tape that got Tyrannosaurus Rex on the radio in the first place. Sailors of the Highway also gets its first official release here: this is rumoured to have been slated for single release, but the song was shelved.My advice is to forget this album and get ""A BBC History"". ""The BBC Recordings 1970-76"" includes more T Rex material but omits the Tyrannosaurus Rex tracks."
2,Not enough meat to this book,"As someone who has read and enjoyed several of Mr. Citro's previous books on Vermont and New England ghosts and unexplained phenomena, I was eagerly anticipating this latest effort. I was, however, disappointed to find that it is a very slight volume with bare thumbnail descriptions of Vermont ghostly activity, usually with only the most rudimentary description of where they occurred. As one who is becoming something of an amateur ghost-hunter, this was a let-down, as the title and description of this work would have you believe it provides directions to find these haunted locales. Sadly, it does not."
5,"Joseph A. Citro can't be beat ""not even with a witches broom""!","Joseph A. Citro is a ""one-of-a-kind writer"". I have read all his books and his writing style and sense of humor combined with serious factual accounts, leaves me breathless. I highly recommend him even if you have no interest in Vermont and its people.I look forward to his next book coming out in October 2009."
2,Disappointing,Tiresomely tendentious and not very funny. There are some good bits -- Pratchett is incapable of writing a _whole_ bad book -- but a great disappointment for Pratchett fans.
1,What's to laugh about?,"This book settles it--I have lost my sense of humor. If you can find laughs in this book, congratulations. You probably collect SNL's last seasons on tape. I was disappointed and bored in turns throughout this book.While Terry Pratchett can create characters and form sentences that nobody ever used before, his conversations are starting to take a predictable form, something like 4-panel comic strips. You know when the kicker is coming and what it will be. I respect his craft and have enjoyed every page of earlier books, but this one and Night Watch seem to have been written by someone else, or when Pratchett had other things to do.I guess I'll stick to re-reading the old ones from now on."
3,Shakespeare had Pericles...,"...and Pratchett has Monstrous Regiment. Devoted Pratchett fan though I am, I found this one disappointing - certainly one of the minor works doomed to lurk (or lurch) along with Last Continent or similarly themed Equal Rites rather than soar with Interesting Times or Pyramids among the truly classic satires. The whole topsy turvy women-in-mens clothing thing seems to have been full of words and music but signifying nothing. As another reviewer put it, when the book ends largely where it began we sort of wonder what we took the journey for...A war story in our present times from a satirist as inspired and insightful as Pratchett is much to be wished for, but I'm afraid this isn't it. Despite this, Pratchett is still a master and it's a fun read, but I'd wait for the paperback."
2,"Poor Terry, Poor Reader!","Let me begin by saying that I love Discworld books. I've read nearly all now. Rabid fans, this one will dissappoint you. Lacking humor, comic relief and focussed on oppressed characters, this one reads like Platoon with women as the leads. Even our beloved Duke fails to add much to the scenes, showing up at the end of novel, wishing he were home.Please,if you love Terry but don't feel like writing him and telling him to take a break; just don't read this book. I feel 9-11 went to his heart and this is his way of showing it.Monstrous Regiment is a Monstrosity."
3,"Ok, but not wonderful","Another disc world book, churned out in the same time scale as the last few. There are a few laughs, though not many, and there is a reasonable story, though not a gripping one.I think ""Ok"" sums up the book well! In the same way as sometimes you'll watch a TV program because it's on, it passes the time until something you're really waiting for comes on. Cameo appearances from Vimes and Anguna in the first few and last few pages may make a regular Pratchett reader pick this up hoping for the rest of the Men at Arms squad to be about. They'll be disappointed. The story itself is basically Girl dresses as boy to join army and find missing brother. And that's it. I have a vague notion that this was more of a dig at how women still feel they live in a men's world, rather than a comedy fiction novel. Shame really, as I was left feeling it achieved neither status."
3,LET'S GET ANTSY,"Remember THEM....THE BLACK SCORPION...BEGINNING OF THE END..TARANTULA? Those magnificently corny but loveable big bug movies of the fifties? Well, THE GLASS TRAP whether intentionally or unintentionally pays homage to these movies in its own delightful way. The ants don't look too bad from a distance, but the close ups are cheesy and pedophilic! But that's what makes this movie so tolerably enjoyable. C. Thomas Howell looks completely lost in his heroic janitor(?) role; Stella Stevens (always Linda Rogo from THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE) chews up the scenery a'la Joan Crawford and Bette Davis; B movie stalwarts Brent Huff, Andrew Prine, Ron Harper and Chick Vennera add cult status; and Martin Kove is hilarious as the ""specialist"" who comes in to save the day. The movie is rightfully ridiculous but if you loved those killer bug movies aforementioned (as I did growing up on them), then THE GLASS TRAP can be forgiven for its clunky amateurishness."
2,"Watchable, slightly boring giant Ant movie","Pretty good production values for a low budget film. The acting is hit and miss, again this is a low budget film so don't expect miracles. I was hoping for more tense sequences with the giant ants, but odd camera angles made most of the fight sequences kind of boring. This movie is on par with made for TV movies on SCI-FI and other networks."
2,The real problem is...,"Firstly, this movie does some things well. The introductions of most of the cast were reasonably good and the general plot began to develop quickly. As for the comic relief parts, some of the one-liners in this movies are better than the one-liners I've heard in most movies.The main problem this movie has is, once the main premise, ants attacking humans in an office building, is underway... the threat level never increases. As you'd expect, the body count rises, but in this movie, that is usually the result of the victim's actions.I think the writers should have spent more time trying to decide what actually happens when ants start attacking people. Aside from that, the only problem is that a central character debuts far too close to the end of the movie.It does have its good points, but ultimately, the main elements of the plot could have been handled better."
3,"Not as bad, as it is made out to be !","Sure they're plenty of better suspense movies than this one, but I don't believe that the reviews are really fair about this movie. Its a low budget movie, that can be easily seen from the rather poor special effects when it comes to showing the gigantic ants. Those types of computer animations are simply 3rd rate, but besides that the movie does develop some kind of suspense. And C. Thoams Howell is pretty good as the reluctant janitor in this film who along with 2 other people have to find a way out of this ant infested office building, since those ants can kill humans. Its not bad, and if one dosen't have anything else to do its worth seeing it for some 90 minutes."
5,Ummm simplicity is hard to do,"Too simple, no cool bass lines? Huh? Hey, it's really hard to keep it simple and clean and still sound as good as these guys do. Anybody can make it complicated. Not these guys. It just comes at you right down the pipe, no gimmicks, no spazmodic special FX.And for sucky vocals, true they ain't Frank Sinatra or the Beatles. But what the hell? It's not Rancid either.This is getting purty close to good ole rock 'n roll before the producers got so smart."
2,The problem with this style of old school punk is....,"The music is to simple. The drums are always a simple 1 bass snare, 2 bass snare patterens. There is no cool bass lines. And the sound of the vocals suck. I gave it 2 stars, though, cuz there is some good guitar on the album. But the music is kinda cheesy."
2,Mislead,The ads that I saw for this item all showed a leather case.Imagine my surprise and disappointment when all I received was the rule ! I didn't mind paying a little more because I wanted the case anyway.I ended up purchasing the case somewhere else.
3,nice but cheap,This was a cute addition to the vanity set but the key to the hairstyling doesn't work as well as the key to the make up. The whole thing is made really cheap and easy to break. The idea was cute but I wish they would have made them with better quality in mind.
3,Great addition to the Disney Princess Vanity,"My 3 year old daughter is really enjoying her Disney Princess Vanity and this toy was a great addition to it. This toy allows your child to use different products to make the vanity talk. It also comes with another key which works with the included products. My daughter is enjoying this toy, but is not rough with toys at all, so I couldn't give a legitimate rating to how durable it is. Overall,it's a nice addition to the vanity, but not a necessity to make it work and interact."
2,Not organized - Confused mix of material,"This book is called ""A language and library reference"".As a reference book, I think this book falls far short. The material is randomly thrown together throughout the book. Sure, it's in there, somewhere, but can you find it?The library reference portion is decent containing a very comprehensive overview of the different headers and classes. I've little problem with this section. If you only need a C++ library reference this is a good book.The language material is quite poor in my opinion. While the book is not geared towards the beginner, finding a simple explanation of say virtual destructors is impossible. You can find virtual destructors in the index but when you turn to the page where it's listed you find it completely lacking. There's a complete lack of explanation, depth, or demonstration.I can't recommend this book except for the library reference. I'm not sure if there's a better C++ reference book out there but I sure hope so..."
5,Ada Bonner LeBouef,"Ada Bonner LeBouef was my greataunt. She was also my father's godmother. The story is very true, as my mother tells it."
5,Two outstanding performances,"I have just bought this DVD and I have seen it two times. There is two shows on this DVD, the complete Godbluff concert in France and the complete same performance consigned in the From the Vaults DVD. So if you want to buy some Van der Graaf, buy this one and get all.Both shows are amazing. The band is in terrific good shape and the songs are performed just as in the original albums. This is not easy considering some songs are quite difficult as Sleepers....Saxes, drums and keyboards just excellent. Peter's voice well managed. Sound and image is better on the older performance, but in the 1975 one is still great."
4,Judy and Friends,"This is a great album! I have been a devoted fan of Judy's for several years now and am most likely one of her yougest fans. My favorite songs of Judy's on this album are Kingdom Come which is her 9/11 tribute and Wings of Angels which she wrote for her son. I have heard her do Kingdom Come the two two times I've seen her in concert and hearing it on the CD is just as powerful.I also enjoyed the proformances of Eric Anderson Arlo Guthrie and Tom Rush. I had not heard of them before hearing this CD and their singing, songwriting and guitar playing are all wonderful. All in All this is a great CD and I'm pleased to add it to my growing collection of Judy Collins music."
1,hard drive Damaged factory: (,"buy this hard drive, waiting to update, and came damaged, making click, click, click, and nothing, not recognized by the BIOS or LESS to want to format with windows 7"
2,I'd be weary if I were you thinking about buying this Hard Drive,"It only took me 10 hours to figure out how to format and add Win7 to this hard drive, talk about frustration. The internet is filled with horror stories about this product and I can see why. I will avoid Western Digital in the future when thinking of buying a hard drive.It works, its quiet, hope it will last a few years."
3,lowest price i found,"I was just swappingout a bad drive with one the same size and speed, best price, fast shipping, and a trusted name in electronic components make it easy to buy here"
5,Time for a replacement,"Purchased to replace a Seagate drive in my RAID system. MUCH quieter operation now, as well as much faster access. Plug-and-play - couldn't be simpler. Sped up my boot time to less than 1/4th of what it was before (now, if I can just clean up my registry...). Bought a second for the other drive, and now things are smooth and seamless. Best money spent on this 4-year-old desktop!"
3,tailgate net,"I like the tailgate net, but not the mounting hardware. In time it will tear the straps. I bought a cheap net a few years ago and it had the same hardware. In less than 2 years the straps were torn due to the mounting hardware having sharp edges. I think that this net is overpriced. The only difference between the cheap net and this one is that this one has the pipe on the sides of the net to hold it up. Shipping was ok"
3,An impassioned but somewhat lacking exploration of evil.,This book was not so much an exploration of evil as it was acondemnation of post-modern philosophy. His arguments in thatarena were for the most part well-reasoned but sorely lackingin supporting evidence. The best part of the book is the secondappendix where Mr. Zacharias explores the question of truth and whether itstill exists.
4,lots of fun,"I was an extra in this movie, so I cannot give a truly unbiased review of it, but it was loads of fun to participate in. Arthur Hiller was a wonderful guy, and so were all the actors. It was like a big vaguely organized circus....in other words, a great experience...Looking forward to seeing my school friends on DVD again."
2,Disappointing treatment of a famously satisfying subject.,"Now that frankness and celebrity clay-foot-probing are in fashion, a new generation of biographies (Kenneth Silverman's ""Houdini! The Career of Erich Weiss""; Patrick McGilligan's ""Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast""; Maria Riva's brilliant ""Marlene Dietrich"") has probed beneath urban legends and P.R. disinformation to find the fascinating human beasts beneath show business icons. A fabulous creature like Mae West rates this type of quality creative journalism, but gets nothing of the sort in Leider's book. A scrappy assemblage of secondary-source research and dull ""setting the scene"" padding, it does tell the bare-bones story of West's feisty career, but it's an awfully tough read. Leider clearly admires her subject, but doesn't have the words (or enough facts) to even begin to bring her to life."
2,Barely scratches the surface..,This book gives a sketchy account of her childhood and dwells on the characters she played rather than who she was. I would have preferred more insight to her personal life since that is what made Mae West so interesting.An easy book to put down.
4,Advanced Classes,"For anyone experiencing Stones Throw Records for the first time, this DVD along with the 'Stones Throw 101' CD/DVD is a must. For those familiar with this L.A label and the plethora of quality releases it boasts, the bonus interviews and studio session clips are as impregnated with goodness as the music videos of the main feature. The sooner you learn that Stones Throw = Excellence, the better. Enroll today!"
3,Sorry Tempest...,"As much as I love Tempest's music (and have for years), I simply cannot give this CD a good review. It seems to me that Lief and company simply went into the studio and said, ""okay, let's just play loud music"" They've gone back to a garage band sound, which doesn't bode well with folk fans. The guitar is all reverb with very few clear notes. Lief's singing sounds flat and the mix is all over the board. Sorry guys, but these sessions should have been scrapped.Addendum: After sitting on the shelf for quite a while, I decided to give this CD another spin and it is now growing on me. I'm still quite disappointed in the quality of the recording, but the music is enjoyable, if you give it a chance.Cheers2nd addendum: The CD was sitting on the sehlf, not me."
2,"Heard by mistake, never again","I was in Austin for an Impossible's concert when I heard this band. They were an opening act, and I must say, I can't see what the big deal is. Their keyboard player is terrible, their lead singer is whiney, and they put on the worst show I ever saw in my life. Their songs are all uninspiring and forgettable, but it was the keyboard playing that left the worst taste in my mouth."
3,A mixed bag,"Virtual Server's second album of artistic collaboration is a mixed bag. Some of the collaborations, such as ""It's In All Of Us"" with Perfidious Words and ""Kept You"" with Wave In Head, are excellent. However, several of the more prominent 'name artist' collaborations are really quite disappointing. The Assemblage23 collaboration track sounds like a jumbled mess, and the remixes on the second disc don't improve on the song much either. In fact, in several instances, the remixes on the second disc make a marked improvement on the original versions on disc one. Other notable disappointments: Echo Image's ""Desperate Man"" can't seem to figure out what it wants to be musically, Rename with ""My Inner Peace"" get very annoying with speaking the lyrics before singing them, and ""Hopes"" seems to be a rock song trapped in a electropop body. After more than three years, my expectations were very high for this album. Sadly, it doesn't meet them."
2,Extra sounds are distracting,"This is a selection of good classical music, but is degraded by cheezy ""horror"" sound effects like on the famous Disney Haunted House record. The sound effects even appear during the classical pieces."
2,Loved it while it lasted.,"I got this set for easter like 2-3 years ago.I was and still am obsessed with panic at the disco, so my dad splurged and got me this. I was crazy in love with it and essentially was married to it for 3 weeks. I watched the dvd at least twice a day, had the poster and pictures in my room, and had the cd on repeat on my ipod.One day, while cleaning, I set a crate on top of it. Not a huge crate, a small one. I lifted the crate and almost fainted- the box had essentially collapsed. The CD and dvd were ruined. The poster (I had put it back in when I started cleaning) had been ripped. I'm on the hunt for a decently priced one at the moment (the dvd is the best think since sliced bread) but I would never pay such a ridiculous price for it."
5,Fun even for a 34 year old!,I purchased this for my brother who is 34 and collects fire trucks. He said it took him 8 straight hours to build but loved how easy it was. There were some pieces missing and he called the company and they sent out the pieces to him with no problem. He is actually looking at purchasing other fire trucks from this line.
1,Managing Operations: A Focus on Excellence,"This is a terribly cumbersome book to use. It is in 2 volumes. It is full of ""supplements"" that should have been put into a separate study guide. There is no index at the back of the book, so it is not easy to use as a shelf reference. The book was not done with high-quality publishing software, but rather just a low-end word processors. Consequently, figures and format are not appealing to the eye. And finally, and most important, it is overloaded with Goldratt's Theory of Constraints and Thinking processes, to the point of making the user think that there is nothing more to OM than TOC."
5,"Loved as a baby, still loved as a big kid","My son is a fussy eater, always has been. This was one his favorites when he was a baby. He's not a baby anymore, and he still enjoys it, as a treat, as long as his friends don't find out! It must be a tasty, consistent product, or my son wouldn't have tried it in the first place. He certainly wouldn't have kept it on his list of favorite treats, either."
5,Classic Big Band Shorty Rogers at his best,"If you are a Shorty Rogers fan, this album is a must for your library. All cuts are original numbers by Shorty and are played by his big band, the Giants. Maynard Ferguson, John Graas, Bud Shank, Jimmy Giuffre, and Shelly Manne are just of few of the jazz legends in this band. Recorded in 1953 and 1956, this album is for real big band jazz lovers."
1,Poor book,I bought this book for used new. And it was very worn out. I had to tape the corners because it was falling off.
4,Great Sounds,"I fell in love with Motorcycle's ""As the Rush Comes"" and came across this CD while surfing for this song...this song nornally plays on party 93.1 (Florida) and is a faster beat(Gabriel and Dresden trance remix) than the one here. The one here is just as fantastic and sounds perfectly sexy. I listened to the rest of the CD and it is great. Worth the $20 bucks spent. Almost all songs are just plain great!"
5,THE GREATEST ADVENTURE STORY EVER WRITTEN,"Out of print? Well check your local library for a copy because you must read this book. I went to the library to check out Tom Wolfe's THE RIGHT STUFF but they did not have that book. So, I looked around for something else to read and that is when I saw PAPILLON. I was only vaguely familar with the man and his story but it looked interesting. I checked the book out and proceeded to read the greatest adventure story ever written. I could not put this book down until I was finished. I will never forget Papillon's amazing struggle for freedom and his life. Henri Charriere's writing made me feel like I was right there with him during his incredible adventures. Some people question the veracity of Charriere's story because they can not believe one man has been through so much and came out alive. I feel it is not important whether the whole story is really true or not, it is only important that you believe it is. Read this book and enjoy!"
5,Amazing book!!,Just incredible that this is real. And probably the best adventure novel ever written. Pure enjoyment and fun.
4,"True or Not, a Grand Time","I could care less whether what Charriere relates is entirely factual or not. He's an ex-con, after all, so we may take a lot of what he says with a grain of salt. Does this means the story suffers as a result of a con's artifice? I think not. The story was written when Charriere was 63. He probably did add a lot of imaginative detail, but he also led a far more interesting, eventful, and courageous life than 99.9% of the book's readers have. Anyone who could come up with these incidents is a natural-born storyteller at any event. The book's sold more than 5 million copies and has been translated into over 20 languages. I don't in the least consider myself fooled, I consider myself enriched for having read it, Believe it or Not."
5,I couldn't stop eating!,"I ordered two bags of this. I have to be truthful I ate one bag without stopping, that's how good this jerky is!!!!!! Two bags were gone in a week, with no sharing!!!! I would highly recommend Wild Bills. I grew up on Tillamok Slab jerky at the convenience stores. I ordered Tillamok slab jerky and it came perfectly formed squares of regurgitated beef. The Buffalo Bill jerky had fat, sinew... it was REAL meat!!!! I will buy three more bags of this in a few weeks! ITS THAT GOOD!"
5,Wonderful!,"Love the product, great quality. Price could be lowered a few dollars, but I'd still buy from them again."
1,Not Good,This jerky is a wide and very thin strip of *something*... I was expecting actual meat pieces... this was more a processed and flattened with a steam roller product. BBJerky does have some *excellent* products but I did not care for this one.
1,Boooooring!,"I'm a fan of turn-based strategy games, I love civilization (1,2,3), I also like rts games like rise of nations, but this one is simply boring... and complicated. It plays as slow as a turn-based, and doesn't even have half the depth! I couldn't play more than half an hour without wanting to run away screaming!Horrible!"
1,Not What I Expected!,I am very disappointed with this DVD. This is the only kettlebell workout DVD that I've purchased and it is NOT what I expected. I expected an intense KETTLEBELL workout. This was more like an aerobics class and BTW hold this kettlebell while you're at it. Do not waste your money on this DVD. I was able to put together my own workout using information I found on youtube/online about kettlebell exercises...and my routine is much more enjoyable and energized than this robotic nonsense. I have to give credit to Angie though - she is very fit. But I doubt she got that way doing THIS particular workout. I guess I'll donate this to the local library so somebody can check it out before wasting their money on it.
1,BORING WORKOUT!!,"If you want to fall asleep from Boredom while working out, then this is the workout for you. It's so slow and so boring that I could barely get through it two days in a row."
3,ACD might be upset,"A fine story, with plenty of action, but I was very troubled by the excessive ""inspiration"" the author received from Arthur Conan Doyle's ""Lost World."" The scientist is an obvious copy of Professor Challenger. But there are whole passages lifted almost word for word from Doyle's novel. Perhaps this was meant as homage, but it was very troubling to me. It's worse in the opening chapters, and disappears for much of the later portions of the book, to reappear at the end."
1,Yuck,"Boy is this one bad. Horrendous art---often done by the colorist is matched by a script which is both dated and poorly executed. There are literally dozens of comics released every week which are far superior. If you want to read a good Batman story written this year, I recommend anything from Greg Rucka."
1,COMPLETE SWILL!,"Like any comics fan of the past 20 years or so, Miller's Dark Knight Returns is a treasured favorite of mine. It's one of the books on any comics fan's list of ""Books I'd have on a deserted island"". With all the hype and excitement of DK2, I really thought Miller would have done more. He had the time to come up with something great. Instead we get three books of crude artwork (even for Miller) and nearly meaningless plot with little motivation for the characters to be doing what they're doing. Complete garbage and swill--and to date I love most of Miller's work. That ends today. If it isn't Sin City, I will not buy another Miller book. If he doesn't care, then neither do I. Save your money--please!"
3,Just wondering,"If Superman is so dim as to fall for the ol' synthetic kryptonite arrow trick twice in a row, I wonder how he survived as long as he did."
5,Outstanding,"I am a major tool fanatic. I love this band, and I have always told people that their compositions are head and shoulders above those of most other metal bands. I have no problem saying that Tool is the greatest Metal band of all time. It's nice to lift these ultra-high quality compositions out of the heavy distortion framework and give friends who doubt Tool's tallent a chance to hear just how great these compositions are in form that they find more accessible. The string players have a little trouble keeping up with Adam Jones' phenominal speed and dexteriy, but they do a nice job overall. I've spun this CD over and over again, and enjoyed it every time. Sweat and Jimmy are the two best performed tracks. This album is guarenteed to enhance your opinion of who and what Tool is. This is a great album."
4,"A Must-Read for the ""CRITICAL MASSES""","This book was highly recommended to me by a good friend and successful businessman. It has a decent storyline- but that is not the heart of the book. The nine insights of this book are REAL and, if not taken too seriously, do not interfere with religious beliefs. It was a coincidence that I read this book at this stage of my life and it only helped me see things clearer. If you want to stop preoccupying your life with materialistic crap...take the journey....read this book!"
3,The Celestine Prophecy,"The only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that the writing was awful. But really, that is irrelevant. The important thing here is the message. From what I have read of the reviews people either ate it up or could hardly stand to finish the book in the first place. The concepts that are mentioned in the nine insights are sound, but hardly origional. I find myself wanting to believe much of what the author has written, but I doubt that any of us would live long enough to experience the culmination of Redfield's 9th insight. It's worth reading, but I still can't say with any certainty if it's for real. Certainly the psudo-story is not."
3,Good Story- Bad Grammer,The story and the 'insights' proved to be both fun and thought provoking. How it made it past the editors is still a question. The writing style leaves room for improvement.
2,Read Between the Lines,"After hearing all the great reviews I was enthusiastic to get started reading this book. I was a bit disappointed, however, I could see some enlightening views on religion and spirituality. We're all in search of explanations. The characters and plot line were a bit cheesy, but if you read this book strictly for the philosphical questions it brought up, it wouldn't be so bad."
1,Pure Junk,"For years I'd resisted this book and finally gave in when somebody loaned it to me. My fears were completely justified. The Celestine Prophesy has somehow been passed as a self-help revelation of sorts but it's really just cutesy trash. It features hack plot driven by poor writing and characters more two dimensional than the screen you're staring at. The ""insights"" are as laughably stupid as they are impossible to achieve by simply reading the book. If you like trash, spend your money more wisely and buy Jacqueline Susann's Valley of the Dolls. That at least has a plot and some real insight."
2,Isn't there enough New Age garbage out there already?,"Another book about finding spiritual awareness and the truthabout who we are? I think we have enough ""New Age"" ideas tokeep us entertained until the rapture. This book is mildly fascinating as a work of fiction, and truly damaging when seen as truth. Judging from the numbers of books sold and the comments of most of those who have read it, the majority view it as non-fiction. The author asks us to ""suspend our doubts"" and then we will see reality. But the reality is in the Scriptures, not this book."
3,not a literary masterpiece,"Well i am going to have to agree with everyone that has said thar Redfield's book is very poorly written. The plot is unbelieveable and silly and the character development is rather weak. While this book is not a literary masterpiece, it does offer something. The book is written to a lower reading level intended for general audiences and is a good starting point for anyone who is interested in learning more about the recent movement to a new ""global consciousness."" The book offers simple insights on life that most people should have already figured out by now. It is not entirely unreadable but for anyone looking for more than a simplistic guide to life I would suggest you look elsewhere"
4,A moving idea written literally very poorly.,"I think the idea he based his book is interesting and made me think about it quite a lot since I started to read it but I also think it is poorly written; dialogues, characters and plot are just not convincing me into the story as I read it. I constantly told myself the tricks he played to reflect the certain messages and it does not feel good when you are constantly aware of the fact that whole thing is a poor set up for the author to say what he want to say. It is like watching a movie and constantly being aware of what kind of cinematic tricks are done to make a certain scene look real"
3,"Prophecy, Catholicism, and the UNKNOWN","This book was self-published because the ideas in the book were being suppressed by the government and the Catholic church? Finally, the author was daring and dedicated enough to his beliefs that he kept promoting his book until it was picked up by the mainstream readers and became a bestseller."
1,Painful reading/ Better book recommended,"This book was truly painful reading! Possibly the worst book I've ever read. I slogged through it because a friend told me I just had to read it (I've been wondering about her ever since).Instead of reading this really bad book, I recommend reading Tom Robbins' ""Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates"", which is a well-written, fun-to-read, actual adventure story that develops similar ideas."
2,"Nice ideas, a pain to read","After reading this book in 1994, I thought it was a book with nice ideas, but it was difficult to read. After all the hoopla I decided to read it again in 1997 to see if I just didn't get it. No, I was right the first time. The author deserves credit for introducing these insights, so I suppose overall the book is worth a read, but be ready to work hard in the process."
1,Pure drivel,"So it turns out that sometimes you CAN judge a book by its cover!! The announcement on the book jacket that the celestine prophecy is ""a book that comes around once in a lifetime to change lives forever"" was enough to arouse some pretty hard core negative intuitions in me. I should have listened to my aura and put it back on the shelf. Redfield's writing skills are pathetic. The characters are boring, shallow, predictable. The dialogue is contrived and unnatural. Sure, a handful of the ideas behind his ""writing"" aren't half bad, but none of it is anything that your average, half competent adult hasn't figured out on his/her own. He makes an astounding number of oversimplifications and gross generalizations. It's also obvious that Redfield needs to do some major brushing up on his biology"
2,Look elsewhere for good fiction and/or philosophy,"The Celestine Prophesy either tried to be a philosophical explanation of life's events presented by the use of fiction, or a fictional story about a man's search for meaning. No matter the intent, Redfield succeeds at neither as the philosophy lacks depth and the storyline is without any gusto.If this book has any merit it is a result of establishing at least enough curiosity in what was to come next to finish the book. On this basis alone, I gave it two stars instead of one. However, if you are looking for entertaining fiction or thought provoking insight, there are far better books that are much more worthy of your time."
3,Non-Parallel to Book,"The movie was good, but if you haven't read the book, it wouldn't make allot of sense. I recommend reading all three books!"
4,"Decent story, but the concepts are what shine","This book has affirmed that my experiences over the past year were not a fluke. I didn't know that I had started practicing the Nine Insights on my own this year.I surrendered to the world around me and started trusting my intuition this year, and my life took off in ways I could have never imagined. Someone who entered my life recommended this book to me over the past 3 months since hearing about my adventures. I finally got around to starting it on a flight, and couldn't put it down. It was as if the world was telling me, you got it right man! Keep at it.Highly recommended if you've had inklings of spiritual energy in the world around you, if you've wondered if there was something more to the coincidences in life, if you've felt something you can't explain in nature, if you've stood in awe of the world around you... give this book a read."
3,An entertaining read.,"The Angel HunterI decided to read this book after hearing several people in my writer's group rave about it. The story was good, not great; but, it was much more than tolerable. OK, it doesn't move fast in places and the entire premise about an ancient manuscript a little cliché, but the insights the character acquires saves the remainder of the book. Why? Because they are spiritual/metaphysical pieces of wisdom that are universal and time tested. Taking the journey through the insights via a work of fiction is a great idea to get the message across. It's worth the read."
4,Beautful Concepts-Lacking in Literary Styling,"This innovative book was an entertaining read. I enjoyed the journey of the protagonist, and at certain times was on the edge of my seat. I only wish the writing style had been more consistent, very cohesive at times and distracted at others. Even still, I recommend reading the book because of the ideas brought forth."
1,Barely readable,"I finally got around to reading this ""Da Vinci Code"" of the 90s at the suggestion of a coworker, prior to a trip to Peru I recently took. I had to force myself to finish it despite my initial inclination to toss it after the first 20 pages made me alternately laugh and groan at the lackluster writing, hoping that it would recover and turn out to be worthy of the best-selling status it once enjoyed.At the end of the day, the prose is forced, the plot line is entirely too conveninient, and the ""life changing"" insights so many people have reported after reading this book were at times interesting observations, but ultimately unconvincing. Any provocative spiritual content was lost for me underneath the weak storyline and average (at best) writing."
2,Fiction - cliché - Predictible,"I can not recommend this book for anything other than a 'light read'. The general plot of a main character's journey to discover nine insights is good... BUT from the discovery of the second insight on, you know the rest of the book. This is in the 'I could read it' category."
2,"This book almost inspired a parody. ""The Filipine Prophesy""","So people's selfish behavior is evidence of a spiritual awakening and we will eventually become weightless creatures of light. I thought this was so pathetic that I nearly wrote a parody. In my parody ""The Filipine Prophesy"" a 2nd generation Filipino guy reaches a new spiritual plane through sloth and weight gain. He sits in a well-worn Lazy Boy that needs a good dose of Febreze and eats generic pastries from the dollar store, cheap orange soda, and Mac & Cheese mixed with Italian sausage. It goes into lots of detail about the relaxed sloth states he achieves. He eventually becomes a dense creature of darkness."
2,disappointed,disappointing writing to the extent that it detracts from the incredibly unbelievable and contrived story. i couldnt finish it.
1,Save your money.,"The author proposes a mildly interesting way of looking at man's relationships with others and with nature, but he cannot write. The prose is one level above, ""Look Dick, see Spot jump."" The plot is no better, and the characters are ludicrous. I can't figure out why this book is referred to in so many places as if it were a classic..."
1,"There may be worst things, but I haven't seen any yet","This tiny literary piece may appear among the nastiest books read by me. It really isn't worth the paper it is written in, not to say the time I had to spend reading it. The Spanish translation only made it a little better (maybe because the translator didn't understand the original English text).Please keep away of it as far as you can."
1,Rubbish,"Self-satisfied drivel. This book is yet another one of the tiresome ""I have a profound revelation for you"" books. Trying to make the mystical out of the ordinary. That this kind of book gets as much press and readership as it does worries me."
1,Big Disappointment,"After working in a discount bookstore for a couple of months last fall, I decided to find out what the hype around this book was all about. I couldn't have been more disappointed when I discovered the flat characters, contrived plot and pathetically oversimplified philosophical tid-bits. I wish I could say that I finished it, but by the fourth or fifth insight I'd grown so tired of Redfield's elementary-school-grammar-class sentence structure that this one was buried at the back of my bookshelf never to return."
2,A drugless Acid Test,"I read this book a few weeks ago and the only parts I valued were its abstract ideas on where humanity was heading. I am currently reading The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, and I am finding a LOT of similarities. The talk of vibrations/vibes and being ""in synch"" with others is covered in both (along with other things). TCP seems to me like a poor Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test brought about by the New Age trend."
1,Stupid,"This is probably the most stupid and boring book I have ever read. The only reason I continued with it was that I had paid good money for it. I will now try to resell it or, perhaps, just give it away, probably with a warning label attached only because I don't want it cluttering up my bookshelf. The writing style itself was quite amateurish and dull. Is this what ""New Age"" is all about? I agree with the review that mentioned Ecco's book. Although I have not read that yet I have read a few of his and they are truly deep and mystical. But The Celestine Prophecy is better than Somminex"
2,trapped in a fortune cookie factory,"I'm not sure why one needs a supposed ancient manuscript from Peru to learn philosophy that can be picked up from a fortune cookie, and a kindergarten version of the history of Western civilization. The sheer implausibility of the story doesn't help either. If I were one of the ""scholarly"" characters in the book, the first thing I would assume was that these documents were particularly clumsy, inept forgeries.Basically, it deserves one star or less, but it is *sort of* absorbing, thus the two stars."
1,Horrible,"Ugh...this is really just the author's religious ramblings, poorly disguised as a novel. And I wouldn't even object to the religious and spiritual aspects of the book (in fact, this is why I picked it up in the first place) if not for the fact that the writing is so spectacularly bad and the characters so one-dimensional. The author can't even keep his facts and story straight (in one scene someone is supposed to be driving and the next paragraph he is reading a map).Normally I try to give books away after reading them but this one I threw in the garbage...I couldn't think of anyone who I would want to subject to this and waste their time. Oh well."
2,good principles but bad writing,"This book did contain some valuable insights, but the writing was very poor. I tried hard to keep going, but it could not hold my attention at all...Worth reading for the insights which are interesting, but good luck trudging through this one."
5,"an awesome, mind-expanding piece of literary genius!","Through the plot's fictional adventure story a life-altering spiritual message is put forth. As the characters search for the sacred manuscripts, insights are revealed that will change the way you see the world, and your life."
2,"Poorly written adventure with unoriginal ""insights"".","The supposed insights are nothing more than a smorgasbord of borrowed ideas. A little Frued here, a little Transactional Analysis there, with touches of Christianity, mysticism, New Age sprituality, and so forth. Although the mixture of ideas and manner in which they are strung together is fairly interesting, anyone who thinks that Redfield's thoughts are unique or original simply isn't very well informed. Seekers of greater understanding of life's mysteries should look past this poorly written piece of fiction for the answers."
3,"Oh come on, folks: GET A GRIP!!!!","OF COURSE this book is atrociously written, OF COURSE its ideas are anything but original, and OF COURSE Redfield is laughing all the way to the bank!But if many people are finding solace and direction from this book, then hey---more power to Redfield! The world is full of quacks and con-men, but not many of them actually bring at least SOMETHING positive into people's lives.This book's main redeeming quality is that it DOES introduce many people to some of the rudimentary basics of Eastern philosophy, coupled with bits of Western psychology.You could do better than to read this book, but you could also do worse."
3,dos and donts...,"It was refreshing to encounter the ideas presented in this novel - the recognition of life energies and how we might use them to benefit the world is timeless and very important. But the novel itself is painful to read. This is no book for those unsettled and made impatient by clumsy language. But for those of us who appreciate the spiritual, alongside fine-tuned language, it might just be worth it to suffer through the linguistic atrocity to lift out the heart and raise it up high."
2,"good idea, poorly executed","The concepts behind ""The Celestine Prophecy"" are sound, but this is a badly written novel. Cardboard characters, pedestrian use of language and ponderous dialogue make this novel laughable to any reader of serious fiction.I'd love to see a well-written book of spiritual fiction sell as well as Redfield's amateur attempt."
2,Anxiously waiting for Insight No. 137,"I've read the book and also a few dozen reviews of it on Amazon. A few observations:(1) Not everyone will like every book that is written.(2) Bestseller status does not imply that a book is GOOD. It implies that the book sells well, that's all.(3) James Redfield's book HAS helped several people who are not accustomed to reading ""heavy"" books on spirituality. I hoped Redfield's goal was for us to not take his insights literally, but to use them to begin a process of self realization. But his sequels did not convince me that I was right.(4) Fiction does have its power in making people ponder many issues. Take for example, ""Anita's Legacy"" available on Amazon, which blends many issues in science and spirituality not addressed by the serial spiritual trio of Redfield, Chopra and Walsch.(5) Like many scientists, I wait anxiously for Insight No. 137, which will explain to us the mystical number in the Standard Model of particle physics."
1,What a disappointment.,"I don't know what I expected but I know what I got. Characters with no character, a weak story line and poor writing. It also annoys me that here is yet another person who thinks he has THE ANSWER. Needless to say, I did not finish it."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"There is such hype for this book that I was really looking forward to some ""insights"". Nothing was really new to me. I was very disappointed. Because it is spiritual ideas presented in a ficitonal format I thought I would at least be entertained. No. It's not a well written novel at all. I think this book would have been more effective if written more as a straight self-help book. There are many more spiritual novels out now that are entertaining as well as enlightening. The Destiny of Miro for example is a great story with some spiritual thoughts thrown in. I recommend it much more than I can recommend ""The Celestine Prophecy""."
2,Nothing new or original,"I really don't understand what the whole fuss is about and why this book is named by some ""the number one bestseller in America of all times"".Seriously, anyone familiar with yogic concepts, buddist traditions, or even Carlos Kastaneda's books knows all these so-called ""insights"" by heart. There is NOTHING new in this book and I cannot believe how many gullible readers are out there. This is just a novel that repeats information that's been around for centuries. Energy fields, power of prayer, purpose of life, power of love and helping others, etc. - children in India can tell you thousand times more about these topics than this book.Having read hundreds of esoteric books, I can tell that this book is nothing but a disappointment.The only reason I gave this book two starts was because it was at least an entertaining reading.Peace to all."
3,A cute fantasy. A quick and interesting read.,"I thought this was a worthwhile read. Not expertly written by any means, but it managed to keep me interested. The 'prophecy' itself and all of its connotations about new-age spiritualism is, of course, pure silly fantasy, but it makes a cute read. Trees with 'auras'...entertaining stuff."
1,A joke... Right,"I read just a few pages of this book and the writing style is so bad that I couldn't continue. I can't believe this book would be a best seller. It is actually a sad testament to our country's average intelligence that this book would be a #1 bestseller. It makes sense though, the book's title sounds like something that would either be excellent or just sensationalized hyperslop. I'm upset I bought this book. I'd ask for my money back, but I only paid $1 for it as a donation to UNICEF anyways.If you suspect you have a triple-figure IQ (and a reading level beyond 8th grade), I highly advise against reading this."
5,Experiencing life as it is happening now,"I was recommended to read this book, because of the way my life is going at present, and cannot believe that I have already experienced Insights 1 and 2 before even reading the book! I have already sensed the changes around me in the last year and can only anticipate with interest the forthcoming one."
3,The reviews of this book are the best I've seen so far!,"I read this book from a science-fiction/fantasy readers point of view. From that standpoint, I loved it. There is a lot of truly awful sf/f out there, but I don't rank this book as one of those. But, the very best part of the book are the reviews I've read here! Do you think we could order a book on JUST the reviews? It would be a much better read and certainly worth every penny spent on it!"
3,One thing must be said about this book...,"It causes quite a stirring, emotional controversy!! The proof is in all these reviews. It obviously provoked enough thought and passion from every person above and below (on this list that is - not on the spiritual plane...) that they bothered to 1) finish reading the book and 2)share their thoughts on it. I think that is quite an accomplishment in itself.I didn't hate it and I can't say it changed my life... but I do think it is a great springboard for spiritual conversation and philosophical debate. You can disagree with the ideas, but it doesn't make it a horrible book. I think it encourages you to think about what you believe in. No book can give you the answers to that ... but some do promote thought. Shakti Gawain's books are really wonderful like that. I highly recommend ""Living in the Light""."
4,Spiritual Awakening,"If you are at the beginning of your spiritual journey, this book is for you. The content of the Celestine Prophecy opened my eyes...and opened them wide... to new ideas, different concepts and a spirituality awareness I'd never had before. The book changed me in a way; it made me think, it led me onto other paths and much more importantly, it made me aware. The book has nine insights which explain certain 'secrets' and show new ways of looking at the world; it is about the dawn of a new age. It is not very well written, from a literary point of view but it catches the imagination and once you 'get into it', you can manage to ignore the writing style. It is well worth a read."
1,"Eeek, bad science","Many other reviewers have done a fantastic job illustrating how frighteningly bad this book is. One item not noted thus far is the amount of bad science in the book. Though it is clearly fiction a great many physicists and biologists would role over in their graves if they read the book. James Redfield has an uncanny ability to completely mistunderstand simple concepts of physics and biology. He routinely presents oddly distorted accounts of well known theories from quantum mechanics, molecular biology and other fields in shockingly incorrect ways."
2,"""Go figure!""","What a riot!!! Reading, skimming, and glancing through all these ""reviews"" -- it's actually much more entertaining than the book ever was (having read it twice -- once when it first came out, and again more recently, trying to see what I had possibly ""missed"" in it the first time). . . So why not add a comment to the plethora of those already pouring out here! The book itself, as so many others have already pointed out, is sadly lacking in any (""standard""/""conventional"")literary techniques/skills/qualities. . .but those ideas -- look at the controversy they've stirred just on these computer pages alone! Look at the pure volume of outpouring of opinions! What a riot! Does that mean there is some force/strength to the book? Or just humans fiercly in search of some deeper understanding and meaning to life; perhaps best picked up by ""original"" philosophical and religious sources as also already commented on by other ""reviewers""? Go figure!"
1,Why is this a best seller?,"After finally getting a chance to read this ""best seller"", I must say I was very disappointed. There were no insights for me. I can't believe people are buying this. It really doesn't compare to the last new age novel I read. ""The Destiny of Miro"" is an intriging story as well as enlightening. I recommend that instead or any of Richard Bach's books."
2,A Commercial Message,"The several insights and the painstaking route to their revelation was a bit boring. For me, the book was a major poke at all organized religion. Like, who needs a religion if you are totally in touch with and love yourself? So much for a 246-page commercial. Now, back to Baldacci and other great story tellers."
1,Not worth the time-rate this one '0',"I heard so much about this book that I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about. I'm just glad that I didn't spend good money on it! I borrowed it from the public library where I work. I love to read, and usually try to finish a book even if it's slow getting into it. I really tried to find something in this one to keep me reading to the end, but about 3/4 of the way through I finally gave up. I found the writing terribly boring, and all the mumbo jumbo about energy fields and dramas just got to me after a while. I found not one redeeming thing about this book. Would have rated it no stars, but that option wasn't available. Sorry I wasted my time on it."
1,Exploitative,"Total and utter nonsense which preys on and exploits those individuals who feel that there is a ""sign"" within this book. I understand that the author does not state that this should be everyone, but as an avid follower of Theosophy I find this book total non-sensical."
1,Wish I had consulted other reviews before buying...,"...this book. When reading a novel, I try to imagine the movie that would be done based on it. I found myself laughing at the dialogue, the characters, and the concepts. Imagine the opportunities for Hispanic actors: Ricardo Montalban would be Cardinal Sebastian, Alejandro Rey would be Father Sanchez, etc. You would have to put Adam Sandler in the role of the tourist and Drew Barrymore could play any of the female characters. Sort of a remake of the Wedding Singer meets Fantasy Island. Another thing occurred to me as I finally got to the end: Members of Greenpeace must have picked up on the theme of preserving ancient forests and are out there right now vibrating themselves silly trying to stop harvesting of trees used to make wood products and paper. How many ancient trees died to print this book?"
1,"Was this a novel, or the central theme of a new religion?","I wasn't actually that disappointed with this book because if mankind really used such a large amount of spirituallity as Mr. Redfield ficticiously implies-this truly would be a perfect world. I constantly felt as I read, however, that the author believed in his mind that this was true doctrine."
5,An exercise in open mindedness...,"First of all, please do me a favor and try not to take the negative reviews too seriously. I believe that those reviewers have not yet reached the point in their lives where they can take something for what it's worth instead of picking apart anything that in their eyes is not absolutely perfect.Don't buy the book--at first. Check it out from your local library and give it a chance before spending any money. If you remain open minded about the information within the book, then and only then will you be able to grasp what James Redfield is trying to get across. This book is not a history lesson or a class teaching geography; this is simply a story trying to help the reader achieve something greater in their lives.So please try to overlook the close-minded attacking reviews and give something different a shot. I promise you that you will not be let down.Thank you for giving this book a chance."
1,Wistful Thinking for the Millennium,"The book might rate two stars only because it's mildly entertaining, but even there it's nothing great. It's utopian dream for the future falls far short of capturing the imagination in the grand way that previous utopian books have done. In short, it's a shallow dip of the toes into a deep, deep sea."
2,Embarrassing,"This book was so poorly written it was almost embarrassing to read. How on Earth did this crap get published? The literary community should do itself a favor and critically tear this book to shreds.I give it two stars only because some of its ideas were interesting, though obviously hairbrained. I just...I just can't get over how terrible the writing was. Someone else mentioned it read like it was written by an eighth grader--I completely agree.What's worse is that someone decided to turn it into a movie! No wonder it ended up getting 4% on [...].Really, really bad. Really."
5,amazing,"If you are a forward thinking, progressive person that is interested in evolution of consciousness then you need to read this book!"
3,expecting more about the squirrel,"I have a pet flying squirrel and thought this book would be as entertaining as my squirrel. This book is meant to be inspirational. Unfortunately, although the author seems to be a fine person, he is not a very good writer. The book had too much detail about his cancer and diagnosis and too little about his interactions with the squirrel."
4,Afghan Stories,I was interested in what the video showed about Afghanistan and its people. It clarified for me some things I was not sure about. It made me realize the great need there is to help these people.
2,Didn't stand test of time.,"Purchased this watch in Jan. of 2007. It is now Aug. 2008 and the band has already broken. The design of the watch prevents a new band to replace it, so I am stuck purchasing a whole new watch. This watch wasn't worn in hard environments and not daily. Disappointed in the short life span. Would not recommend."
2,"The band, and hence the watch, are short lived","I loved the watch: Large display, good looking, excelent functionality. However, the band and the case are one piece of resin, and the band teats very easly after quite a short time. Unfortunately, it is unrepairable (I tried some ugly repair but than the band broke in another location soon after)"
5,"Great features, great price and very stylish","The watch arrived yesterday and right out of the box I was amazed at two things. First, the watch band is a nice soft rubber that is very flexible, but it does not feel cheap. The second is the clarity of the watch face. Very easy to read. It took all about two minutes to set up the time with the digital face as well as two different time zones with the instructions provided. I also like the fact that you can hide the digital clock and date by holding down one button. The indiglo light is also bright enough for my needs. All in all, great buy for the price and I hope that it lasts for a long long time."
5,A perfect introduction to the music of J.S. Bach,"This disc is as good an introduction to J.S. Bach as any I can think of. As the insightful liner notes indicate, Bach often used parts of earlier compositions while writing his 1730s concertos for harpsichord(s); researches into these concertos suggest that those included on this disc were originally written for oboe, and whether it's ultimately the case or not, this recording shines. Christian Hommel's restrained performance serves the music perfectly: each track features vast melodies and excellent ensemble-playing; meanwhile, the sound quality and balance couldn't have been better. This is pure, abstract music at its best: music whose power doesn't depend on what it might 'suggest' or 'represent', but only on its own language. And like all great music, the pieces on this disc become the springboards for contemplation that French painter Albert Gleizes yearned for in the early 1940s. Strongly recommended."
4,disposable blue underpads,"I read the other reviews where some say the product is flimsy, rough, not worth the money. I beg to differ. They have been a great value to us. In this day and age where money is really tight it has been great to save some money here at Amazon over the brick and mortar stores. We have been using these for our invalid cat. We trimmed her nails so she wouldn't rip the pad and it works. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and right now they are beautiful to us and Ms Kitty. Will buy again when needed."
3,Okay Value,"These are very large, which is nice, but they fall apart very easily. The ""stuffing"" comes out. Too messy for me."
5,Disposable blue underpads as dog pads,"I have been using underpads for my three inside dogs,15 lbs. and less,for nine years now. I put dowm four pads and change out a pad as the day goes on. This works out great for when they can't go out. Over night,bad weather, extended car rides, outside animals onthe road or at peoples homes. I use one pad at a time in the car or at someone's home or hotel. My dogs and other peoples dogs love using the pads. Buying the adult underpads are cheaper than doggy pads. These pads are just a little less thick then I'm use to. Buy, they are excellent. The price for qty. ratio is very affortable. I will continue to purchase these pads."
1,Very cheap,The urine ran right through these I guess you get what you pay for. Very very very thin. I would not buy.
3,New recordings...be aware!,"While the songs are still good, they are just not the same. These are updated versions of the classic songs. More bargain price, but you get what you pay for. I'll now be buying the ""Best Of.."" album instead. Only one of the original ladies sings here according to the liner notes. They do a decent job, but it's just not the original."
2,The Absolute Beginners Guide: stringing bead jewelry,This video is not worth the money you pay. The information is no more than you can get off of the internet for free. There was nothing about stringing jewelry just tools and how to use them. Very disappointed and wasted $20.00 of my money
5,"Stinging Beads with wire, etc.","Now this was a great dvd. Full of information on how to make jewelry. I am ready to start creating again.I want more projects. Let me have them. I would recommend this to beginners and if you have forgotten how to make jewelry because you have not done it for 6 to 7 years (Smile).I really brings everything back for those jewelry makers who have not done jewelry making in a long, long time. The dvd pays for itself. It is really, really simple and easy to make jewelry without taking a class. You can do it from you home. I wish I had purchased the books too.Great buy."
5,Plastic but works,"Tried these out on my Yugo SKS and it helped a great deal. I had a hard time seeing the old front sight,black on black, in all but ideal light and background. It is a good idea and will use it till something better comes along. I cant see that happening any time soon. I gave one to my brother who used it on his AK-47 and he love it also. Hope it holds up to the heat of a hot barrel. Its winter here in Michigan so I cant get anything hot enough to comment on that. Will buy more if I do break it somehow....Good product idea."
1,Don't do it!,"I bought these to help see what I was aiming at. I thought it looked like a good idea, but it sure wasn't. The front sight ended up melting and I decided that the front sight that came on the rifle was better. When I went to take it out, it twisted up and then finally broke in the rifle, so then I didn't have a front sight at all. Also, I don't know what the idea was of making the middle of these things hollow, but it sure does help them twist up and bend when you try to turn them. Get a scope or stick to the sight that's on the rifle. These are as hard to see as what was on there and more pain than they are worth."
4,Improved Target Acquisition,"I was having difficulty distinguishing between the front sight post and the protective posts on the sides of the front sight while trying to shoot quick. These colored sights greatly improve target acquisition. I only gave them a 4 because they are made from plastic, not metal like the stock front sight post. But since they are housed pretty nice, I don't anticipate any breaking issues."
4,Fine improvement on an awful sight,"I found it really hard to see my WASR front post. I wanted to keep iron sights and nearly bought the XS sight replacement. I'm sure that product is quite good, but I paid $5 for these and my ability to see them clearly is excellent. If they were metal, that might be a 5 star. Seriously, it's hard NOT to improve on the AK's sights."
1,Sent wrong item twice,"This is the second time I ordered these sights from Amazon and the second time they shipped the wrong item. They shipped AR-style sight posts, not the AK/SKS sight posts."
1,NOT DISEASE RESISTANCE,"CONRAD-PYLE COMPANY IS THE PATENT HOLDER FOR KNOCK OUTS AND THERE ADS CLAIM IT IS""NO MAINTAINENCE"" AND RESISTANT TO THE MOST COMMON DISEASES OF ROSES. THIS IS A FALSE AND DECEPTIVE CLAIM AND IN MY OPINION A VIOLATION OF THE LANHAM ACT AND THE VARIOUS STATE ACTION UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE ACT. I HAVE MY FIRST 14 BUSHES HERE ON HILTON HEAD ISLAND, SC WHERE THERE IS A CONSTANT SEA BREEZE. IN SPITE OF CARE ALL DEVELOPED POWDERY MILDEW WITH TWO WEEKS AS WELL AS BLACKSPOT. I ANTICIPATE FILING A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT AND INVITE ANY WHO HAVE HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCE CONTACT ME AT DOCRBOLT@YAHOO.COM"
5,"Conte, real and moody",You can get lost here in Conte world. Beautifully recorded with a very intimate sound that has the power to transport you smack in the middle of a Fellini movie. A good Felinni movie. I need to meet this man.
1,Not a star,Hilary Duff will not take the place of Britney or Christina. She won't make it that far. Hilary Duff isn't that good of a singer. Put her at a performance when she has to sing LIVE without anything to fix her voice. It's almost guranteed that she really won't sound anything like how she sounds on the CD. She really needs to stick to acting. And when I say acting I mean on TV shows. Movies are not her thing. There were noticable flaws in her acting in The Lizzie McGuire movie compared to the show.
3,Strange Choice Of Songs,"Well as my subject suggests there are some weird songs in here that dont fit into todays style of music...well The Lizzie McGuire style of music, like the 1950 or 1960 something song by Frank Sinatra( i think) ""On an evening In Roma"" well, that is not too appealing to kids now all I say is ""Why Not?"" ""Tide Is High"" and all that are good.But They couldve improved on the songs used in the movie."
1,Horrible,"This CD I thought would be pretty good. I have heard Hillary singing before, and it was good, but this CD was just crapy. I would rate it from 1 to 2 out of 5, but you choose. Also, I have found that the Buffy The Vampire Slayer soundtrack is REALLY great, and I bought that, too. I would rate it 5, and you can buy it on this site! Even if you hate BtVS, you will definately love the soundtrack. My sisters and friends (which includes guys) really like the music, and I only have a few friends who like the show, and only one sister."
5,A refreshing change of REAL sound!,"I discovered Bob Schneider in while working in Calif. I actually saw him live in a small club call the Mystic and he was amazing! His voice, lyrics and music are just such a nice change from so many other ""sound alikes' these days! I think I havce listened to his CD atleast 100 times!"
3,Good CD from a Great Texas Artist.,"I was lucky enough to get ahold of a promotional cd the end of last year and have been fasinated with this award winning artist ever since. I even bought The Scab's CD and one of his earlyer ones. I also went to see him and he is awsome. From the first chord of Big Blue Sea, I was hooked. A lot of it is however an aquired taste. Big Blue Sea and Metal and Steel being two major exceptions. These songs hook you instantly. The only reason that I gave it only 3 stars is that I never give anything over 4 because no cd (in my opinion) is perfect (although after a few listens this one comes close) and since some songs have to grow on you I choose 3. A lot are more mellow like 2002 but after 3 listens I ashure you will love these as well.It's totally worth it!!!!"
5,Thee Very best there is,I have bought every album Billy Joe has made. He is my all time favorite singer/songwriter. Its too bad he is not better known. Everybody that I have played his music to ends up loving him and his songs. Treat yourself.
5,perfect,"i have a new collection of snuff bottles, and this shelf is indeed 'perfect'..... with the door i wont have to dust them !!!!"
5,Better than the 1st!!!!!!!!!,"And I thought Texas Angel was Great. I'm guessing by now that I must just be a hopeless romantic, but the Christian faith displayed in these books are very encouraging and I think its great for others to see that God is a forgiving all-knowing, merciful God. Thanks Judith Pella for a great read:)"
5,UNIVERSE 10 TERRY CARR,"This is another replacement book. I had purchased when it was first published and then and loaned it out a few years ago, so am now replacing it on my bookshelf. It's an excellent anthology with the theme of possible futures, by some very popular sf writers of the time (1980). Good reading."
3,Excercise dvd,"It was a very well-instructed dvd. As stated, it is definitely for beginners. My only disappointment with it was that it was all the same exercises presented in 3 different ways-meaning a superset, a push-pull set, etc. According to the time on it, it was a long dvd but since they were all the same exercises a little disappointing if you were expecting more."
2,What a disappointment,"Let me start by saying I'm a big Pat Benatar fan an have been since the beginning. I own all her albums (first on tape, now on CD/DVD). I'm saddened to say, ""This one is not up to par"". I rushed to buy ""Go"" the day it was released, and was more and more disheartened as I listened to each track. The arrangements were ordinary; nearly every song sounded the same; Neil's guitar was overbearing throughout; and most of the lyrics were worse than songs I wrote in high school. My advice is buy ""Best Shots"" again; don't waste your time with ""Go""."
5,All Fired Up!,I overheard the title track while sitting in a theatre waiting for a movie to start and I just had to buy it. You will not be disappointed. The guitar tracks are a little more produced but in a good - creative - rocky - way. I love the first 6 tracks and the bonus Christmas song is awesome too.
4,Queen is back,"Pat is back and after some slightly conventional recordings kicks ass! Some of the songs are true killers including ""Go"", ""I Won't"", ""Girl"" and ""Have it All""...Musts for all Pat fans and I would recommend those songs to any wanna-be rock chick to keep her feet on the ground!However, while pointing out to be a succesful turn towards modern rock (sounds, production) the CD also contains songs that I would call merely as ""unnecessary paddings"" such as ""Sorry"" and ""Out of the Ruins"". And...I do not know whether it's because of being non-American that I truly cannot understand patriotic and pathetic songs like ""Christmas in America"" (Thanks god it's a hidden track).To conlude: This CD, although a bit uneven, is a comeback of the Queen of Rock and I truly recommend it to anyone fond of great rock music full of emotions. Pat's voice is incredible and Neil's guitar exciting and unique, as has been the case since the beginning..."
1,Way too big,These things are huge. Not what I expected at all. Was looking for something that was more realistic in size. It was returned.
3,You get what you pay for.,"Low quality, but cheaply priced. Label peels off easily. Voice is echoed back to singer, & my 2 1/2 year old likes that. Fine for the money."
2,May be too strong for my turtle,"My red ear slider began having swollen eyes for a while, even at a 13"" height. I had to push the UV light back a little since I couldn't adjust the height any higher. Now I can't tell if the light is working or not. I should have gotten 5.0 UVB"
2,Not worth the money.,"This book has many many examples. However, they are not documented very well. Most all of them are useless also. I'd pay $5 to $10 MAX! Save your money and buy a good book from the Microsoft Press."
3,Incomplete - really,"I liked the book for the format but my copy is missing many pages! It jumps from page 190 directly to page 239! No they were not taken out of the book, the book binding is perfect - no tears, no rips - just missing! I'm returning it and looking elsewhere."
5,Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (TV Miniseries),"I was thrilled to dee this come out, and glad that SciFi stuck pretty uch too the book in making this movie."
4,not something to miss,"Never read the books. Played the games. LOVED the first game above all. The Dune original movie got over my head at the time. The miniseries on the other hand engulfed me into it's fantastic originality. ""Children of Dune"" is no exception. Flawless acting, brilliant story, decent special effects and the score will pull you into the scene constantly."
2,Bathory;Countess Of Blood,"THe story is supposed to be told by A monk;Telling of A noble woman who feared old age and dying young how she murdered many young peasant girls to feed her lust,until it was found out."
5,Really holds the attention of 3-4 year-old children.,"As a K-4 teacher, I have used this book with preschoolers for nine years. I never tire of reading it, and the children never tire of hearing it. I encourage them to ""stomp their feet"" like the two shoes, and ""wiggle their pants, shake their shirt, clap their hands, nod their heads, and best of all, say 'Boo!"" It makes the book interactive and it is always fun. My book is so ragged, I am buying a new one in hardcover."
3,The little old lady who was not afraid of anything,This story is a great read aloud. I purchased this story because it advertised book and tape. I ordered this material to have it in a listening center in my classroom. Sadly it did not come with a tape. Advertising was not correct.
5,Food and Behavior Connected with Many Examples,"This well researched look at food as a key ingredient for your health is easy to read, full of examples of what food causes what behavior, and why the energetics of food is so important. Modern nutrition does not take energetics into consideration regarding symptomatic behaviors, for example, contraction can make you irritable and expansion can make you overactive. Meat is contractive, sugar is expansive. Modern Western nutrition is based on fragments, such as taking vitamins and drugs without even trying to improve health with food changes. Miller gives examples of case studies that show symptom improvement with food only. Well worth the time to read this."
3,Just What I Expected ... Sort Of,"The cabinet was delivered on the promised day (a plus). Boxes were in good shape (a plus). Opened and inspected - there were some nicks and such but nothing I can't live with. No broken pieces so that was good. The dimensions stated were spot on (I only had about 1"" of leeway) My only issue is that the door hinges are a bit crooked. They were pre-installed so I have no way of fixing them. It makes two of the four doors very difficult to open. They stay closed by a magnet at the top. The magnet grabs the doors and won't let go.Anyway, the cabinet works out perfectly ... sort of :-)"
3,Pretty,"These are not as comfortable as the Indigo section of Clarks. Also, the pewter can look somewhat bronze-y. That said, they are very attractive...I have received several compliments. Even teens love them on me...a great compliment!"
4,"Very comfy, but too narrow","I bought these in an 11M which is the same size as all my other Clarks shoes and they are very comfortable and stylish, but also very narrow and tight around the front of the foot. If I thought i could stretch them out I would to keep them. The height of this shoe only feels like about 2"" because of the foot platform. Very beautiful and flattering on the foot!"
3,The DVD,"The story was good, but, the DVD itself was very poor.There was mumbling and stoppage and in parts of thefilm the picture was cloudy. Not good."
5,Well rounded book on solitary practice,"Unlike a lot of people out there exploring wicca for the first time, I have been studying and practicing the craft for over 30 years (I am 55 y/o). This book is well rounded and covers the topics adequately. Wicca is a religion about doing and not just reading books. This book may be too much for the beginner, and they should consider Scott Cunninghams books. This book is more of a refresher for me and is just what I needed.BTW - Magic is not spelled with a k unless you are at Thelemite (OTO_Crowley). Most magicians in Britain do not refer to magic as magick.Blessed be,Bearcraft"

2,Disappointing,"I bought this book looking for an insider's perspective on the NFL, which I suspect is not as glamouros as you might expect. While Tim Green potentially had an interesting perspective, the book fell flat. The 1-3 page chapters read as though they were dashed off in a few minutes and are as vapid as tabloid press. Why do bad teams remain bad? The owners, of course. Do NFL players take drugs? Some do (or did) but Tim Green didn't, of course. Is Deion Sanders as much of a jerk as he appears? Maybe yes, maybe no, depends on how you look at it. Is training camp awful? Oh yes, it's horrible, awful, they make you run around on a field in the heat, and oh by the way you get paid a million dollars or so for it. About halfway through the book I just started flipping through pages looking for something interesting, and finally put it down. Not worth even the $9 Kindle edition."
2,"Drops few names, vague, not well written","I was disappointed by this long, winding, dull account of life in the NFL. Tim Green, who keeps telling us how smart he is, rarely gives us the scoop. He'll say, ""Someone I knew did this once."" On groupies, he tells us that NFL players stay away from them, and can't get girls -- yeah, right. In a book about the dark side of the game, he fails to address the type of violence demonstrated recently in the Rae Carruth, Ray Lewis, and Fred Lane situations, nor does he explore the NFL's drug culture -- Bam Morris, Andre Rison -- nor does he get into the real problems with college football and how so many players with college educations can be so dumb. I was hoping for something better."
4,A very fast read,"I give this book a positive review but at least one criticism is well founded; the chapters are very short. I knew that somewhere in this book he would talk about football groupies. I wasn't disappointed. However, after those few pages, all I know is that groupies are more trouble than they are worth. Big deal. I wanted some good stories. Aren't there any? Still, I read the whole thing in 3 nights because it went so fast."
1,"Tedious, inauthentic treatment of very real phenomenon","I picked this up hoping it would be a chilling but illuminating exploration of the Holocaust Reincarnation Phenomenon. It is not for me to say whether or not the experiences of people who believe in this are real but I do know that this author just has not done his homework on the Jewish Holocaust experience in my opinion. This book cried out that it was written by a non-Jew, which is not to say that a Gentile couldn't write well about this subject, just that this one didn't write well on the subject. I was further dismayed by the obvious resemblence of the Fictional Rabbi to the one Rabbi who in real life has spoken out about this issue. For some further and much more literate comments on that, please read his statements below. In conclusion, I feel you would do better to seek out non-fiction works on this subject until such time as a more skilled writer takes up the subject."
4,An Encyclopedia of the Wines and Domaines of France,"This provides a good overview of what is a complex system of French wine regions. With so many - over 10,000 wineries - this is a good guide."
1,Who Needs a Family Like This?,"I usually love Ms. Krentz' books but this one was a turkey. Why? I found the hero completely unlikeable and couldn't imagine why the heroine wanted him. Self-centered, cold men and women without much pride don't do it for me."
3,"Obvious rehash of ""Ravished""","Which completely ruined the surprise for me, but this book still had some nice points. I like that the hero and heroine both just have regular jobs (albeit well-paying ones) working for someone else and aren't superstar entrepreneurs. While ""Ravished"" happens to be my absolute favorite AQ, I don't think the formula quite works as well as a modern. Also, while it's a nice change of pace to see a heroine who's not the sharpest pencil in the box I hope JAK is not planning to make a habit of that. I like the sharp-witted women in her other books."
2,"Felt like a Marvel story, but then again...","There is no perfect Earth.The DC universe is corrupt? Let's see...Joker actually turns out to be a hero (I know, he's not presented as one, but he offs AL, so he's a hero). Wonder Woman kills someone? Yeah, right. Batman actually points a gun at someone? Yeah, right again. The big blue schoolboy saves the universe? Hack, ptooey.Everybody makes mistakes (the big idea from the series along with there's no perfect Earth). It's too bad that DC didn't realize that this series was one of them."
5,Introducing Two Incredible Villains,"I found this particular event story line fantastic. Not because of an amazing, intricate plot, or a cerebral end message, but because of the atypical villains who have now become two of my favorites. I know that reason doesn't merit much critical value, but aside from that, it's still Geoff Johns, and again, he does not disappoint. Some may complain about the intricacy of the plot and the obscurity of some of the characters used, but a little research can clear up any questions and allow any reader to continue with this fantastic story."
1,Infinite Boredom....,"Unless you read DC comics religiously, you will not enjoy this book. One of the main complaints I hear from people that try to read these massive DC events is that they are inaccessible to regular people. Nothing in this book will make sense to you unless you know about 30+ years of DC comic history. If you excuse the lazy writing, the art is pretty good. The only other problem is that you won't care about any of the characters in the book because you wont know a thing about them....Except maybe the 3 different versions Superman. You did know there were 3 of them right?"
1,Out of Business,"MoneyDance seems to have gone by the wayside. No support, no website, nothing. So waste of damn money. Don't get it- if you're looking for support."
2,In serious need of a &#65533;Missing Manual&#65533;.,"What appears to be a clean, efficient system is crippled by a lack of documentation. The documentation barely covers what most users could determine through a day of experimentation.Setting up and using bank accounts is very easy. This is where the software shines.While the software includes investment tracking, the functionality of this feature appears to be too weak to be of much use.Rather than being a ""personal finance manager"" this software is best described as a ""personal bank account manager""."
1,Not Mildew Resistant,"If buying this shower curtain, I would definitely use it with a liner. Mine has become very mildewed at the bottom. It looks very nice when new, and I did like the see-through top portion, but I am going back to plastic now."
2,Looks good but needs liner.,Must use a liner with this as the water will seep through the thin sheer (almost mesh-like) material.
3,Hookless design great but fabric allows water through it,"The hookless design is great and folds up neatly to the side. However the water repellancy is not as good as it should be. Shower spray that hits the body and reflects onto the material will eventually penetrate and as a fine water mist that dampens what should be the dry side (the tile or paint).The solutions I see is either take a very quick shower (like 1-2 mins), add a plastic layer, or be careful to ensure that the least amount of water hits the curtain!It looks nice though."
5,Very nice,"I just love these hookless shower curtains. Wish I would have known about these a long time ago. This particular one is great. Lets some light in so you don't feel closed up. Nice material also, dries quickly. Especially for the price."
2,It's not worth it,"It's not worth it if you already have the Blueprint 2 album, the 2 additional tracks are not that hot. Save your money and just buy the Blueprint 2 double album."
3,poor tracklisting,"good in theory, although maybe too soon after the original release, but the tracklisting leaves much to be desired. There were some songs that were left off, such as 'Diamond Is Forever', that definitely should've been put on. And the most notable 2 tracks that shouldn't have made the cut were 'A Dream' and 'The Bounce'. Despite this, Jay-Z is still the lyrical king, and if you didnt pick up Blueprint 2, definitely get this one, you can't miss out on this project."
5,5 mics,Hov done did it again.What an amazing collection of songs Jigga put together for this BP 2.1 masterpiece. The 2 bonus tracks are great too with dope production from Swizz Beats and the Neptunes. Obviously this is a must have.
2,Blueprint 2 AGAIN + 2 hidden tracks (WHERE'S THE NEW STUFF),"I'm definately a Jay-Z fan. I never thought I would give a Jigga album two stars. Don't get me wrong, if you didn't buy the first Blueprint 2 you definitely should buy this album. If Blueprint 2.1 came out first I would have given it 5 stars, but this is simply a repeat of B2. I was hoping the tracks would be remixes or something other than a repeat of B2. If you own a copy of B2, it makes absolutly no sence to buy this album, because you already have these songs except for the 2 bonus/ hidden tracks. Which could have been release separately on a maxi single. The bonus tracks are HOT, but you need to decide if it's worth buying the whole CD just for 2 new tracks."
3,There should be a Blueprint 2.1.1,"Jay-Z - Blueprint 2.1 (Roc-a-fella, 2003)All of the wackest material is gone from the double album Blueprint 2 but filler still remains on this version. Jay should have downsized a little more to make a perfect EP. The end result would only have ""The Watcher 2"", ""Poppin' Tags"", ""All Around the World"", ""U Don't Know Remix"", ""Meet the Parents"", ""The Bounce"", and ""La-La-La (Excuse Me Again)"". On second thought, just skip this and go straight to The Black Album. -EJR"
4,Still Yet to Dissapoint.,"I still cant believe these guys are still going.It seems like they have been around forever.Not that thats a bad thing,I just thought their Livers would have given in by now.Alongside The Living End Frenzal are one of the longest standing Punkish bands around,And they still havent dissapointed.Ill admit A mans not a camel wasnt great but still worth paying 20 bucks for.But this is by far the best they have done in years.Its hard to listen to some of these tracks without rolling over in laughter,Namely Russell crowes band,whod be a cop and I went out with a hippy and now i love everyone except for her (the latter being my personal Favourite).There are on the other hand a few tracks that touch on serious subjects Lead poisoned jean,White world and all the kids are having kids but are also written in typical frenzal Fashion.Without doubt the best since Meet the family and definately worth buying."
3,Without Worry,"Frenzal Rhomb returns with another album of great Aussie punk. The songs on 'Shut Your Mouth', their previous album, showed hints of evolution beyond punk; they were fleshed out and more developed than previous Frenzal work, most likely a result of the album being released on a Sony label in Oz. On 'Sans Souci', Frenzal have abandoned their recent ways and returned to what they do best: cramming an album full of funny, fast songs. The new record has sixteen tracks and clocks in at just over a half hour. Jay's lyrics are as sharp and scathing as ever: see 'Russell Crowe's Band...' for his take on celebrity hubris and musicianship. The songs are fast, vulgar, and most are under 2 minutes in length. The album is peppered with funny samples as well, keeping the Frenzal humor intact. A solid release from a bunch of guys who are almost too cool to be vegetarian!"
5,Brainwave Suite,The music is easy to listen to and it definately accomplishes what it sets out to do. The author of the suite is well known for his work.
4,A good introduction,This is a good introduction to the area of brainwave entrainment- it can give users a first taste. But the best choice would be to research the subject and use custom audio programs like NP.
1,Would give it zero stars if I could...,Spend the extra money and stick with Legos. My son is a Lego finatic and received this ProBuilder set for his 10th birthday. The directions for this set must have been written and illustrated by a two-year old. We spent hours on this only to have to take it apart time after time to see where we went wrong. He ended his day in tears and went to bed frustrated. I threw the pieces in the box and then in the garbage. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
5,My son said to give it six stars,"My five -year-old son ( and older kids ) loved this movie. "" I liked when the bad guys fell down on the bridge and then went back up , and they were jumping up the stairs and down . It was funny!""--- Mitchell , age 5"
1,Worst animated hero movie ever.,"This thing is pathetic.A blemish on Hulk fans and an insult to fans of the other Marvel Heros.Glad it wasn't Live Action, would have made Dolph Lungrens ""Punisher"" look Oscar worthy !"
4,kicking butt,Fun to watch after a long hard day. Hulk kicks a lot of butt in this. He destroys a lot of things in this.
4,For very large pockets,"This pocket manual is for very large pockets and when you want to stop and read at your next mechanical. It's more like a rehash of the larger mountain bike maintenance book by Mel rather than something you can quickly flip through to get you back on the trail.That's not saying that it's a bad book. Far from it! I love Mel's conversational style and writing that is low on unnecessary shop talk. If you digest this book or her larger Mt Bike guide you should be set for any mechanical problem you have on the trail and you can do almost any bike maintenance at home.That said, I think that the small print size and volume of perhaps unnecessary for on-the-trail repair info makes this something I don't lug around on rides and I go for the non-pocket guide when working at home."
4,Short changed,"Excellent album, great songs, beautiful bluegrass voice and some really fine backing muscicians, so why am I left unsatisfied? The total total track length is only 34 minutes! Thats not good value for my purchase, most albums run for 40-50 minutes. Nice album - shame about the length."
4,Excellence truncated,The only criticism of this work is that it's too short. I think Dibdin is such a beutiful writer that the tale (ordinary enough) is almost secondary. Viva Aurelio..e Gemma !!
1,Item doesn't fit 2008 Odyssey,"Just got a new 2008 Odyssey EX-L. Found this item on Amazon and it is listed as compatible with my car. Listed as being installed with Adhesive tape. When the item arrived, no tape in package. Item is wrong shape for 2008 hood. Listed 2005 and 2006 Honda models on package."
2,Disappointing,"The ""kinder, gentler"" ending removes the dangerous aspect of the wolf. The wolf is intended to represent the evil in the world beyond the garden gate and Peter vanquishes it by being smarter and more agile. Both the threat and the victory are diminished when the wolf simply promises to do better in the future. Yuck.Politically correct tripe."
3,Sorbie Shampoo,"The Sorbie shampoo is an excellent product. I have been using it for many years; it never leaves any deposits in my hair. The only ding against this purchase was that one of the bottles that I received was damaged and leaking. I had purchased this before from another reseller without incident, and will probably return to that reseller."
2,great idea but,"ok, this was a good idea and it was easy to install. However, i'm not sure it would fit just any dog house and also, i have a rottweiler and it didnt last long. She actually tore it out of the dog house and ripped it up. waste of money for me."
3,"Fit well, lasted well through multiple wearing",We were mostly happy with this costume for my 5 year old. The only dissatisfaction was the hood. It was poorly made and the face part was meant to tie behind his head and then the hood velcro'ed under the chin. The face part did not sit well and kept sliding off. I attempted to attach the face part to the hood with safety pins but it did not work well. He ended up wearing the hood alone for part of one night and then skipping it altogether for later wearing.
4,ironing board cover,"very nice. cant complain about it. my daughter said it works well. but could be just a bit larger, just a tad small"
3,Karaoke CD (Gospel),This is a really good Karaoke CD but there are not enough songs on it. It only has four. So I think the price is a little high since you can get some others with 10 or 12 songs for about the same price.
2,not as nice as i expected,This paper prints with a yellowish tint. All of my pictures look yellow and they didn't print as clear as they did with my Lexmark paper.
5,Epson Photo,This paper works well with the Epson printer but I would not expect any less from Epson. I would like to see more than 20 sheets
5,Another Great,"Even though this is only a small cd, this is still another good cd by dc Talk. The guys sound good solo and I can't wait till there solo cd's come out later this year."
5,Great cd!,"I was a dc Talk fan before this cd came out and boy are they the hottest christian rock group. When it did I got it on my 14th birthday. I thought is was really good and the interesting thing is that this cd is a special edition of them each singing their own songs that will be on their own cds that are coming out. #2 and 3 are sung by Mike Tait and his music is more rock type, the next two songs are sung by Kevin Max(the one with the cool voice) and his music is more like alternative rock and the last two songs are sung by Toby Mac(Mckeehan) which is more like hip hop. But all together this cd itself is really good. All the songs are great. My Favorite song is Return of the Singer because the tune is good and plus because of Kevin's cool voice. Keep a look out for their seperate albums. Mike Tait's cd, Empty, is out. Get this cd though. You don't know what you are missing."
3,"Not bad, but forgettable.","I picked this book up the other day from the library and was a full quarter of the way through it before I realised I'd read it before. There's a reason for that. It's not a bad story overall, but it suffers from a lack of anything unique or innovative enough to make it memorable. The plot and characters are all passable, but I guarantee almost any reader will have come across many like them before.I'd recommend Mirror of Destiny to fantasy fans after a decent read to pass the time, but don't expect to be impressed."
1,Rather Broken Up Approach,"I didn't like the progression of how this book came together. It has a rather confusing approach simply because it tries to mix teaching the basics of chess (rules and strategy) along with trying to insert it into a classroom and trying to make it entertaining for kids. It simply fails in the approach to trying to put it all together. Some useful info [] - some not so colorful (black and white) pictures in the book - why would a teacher want this? - it isn't written for kids for sure.Some of the printing quality was lacking. But this book could have been done up a lot better and perhaps the ""detective press"" ..."
3,Some good pointers for chess teachers,"TEACHING CHESS IN THE 21st CENTURY would be a worthwhile book to own by an elementary school teacher who knows the basics of chess and wants some ideas to direct them in how to conduct a chess program.The book is not as comprehensive as it could be. However, if you suppliment it with A SCHOLASTIC GUIDE TO CHESS (and possibly A PARENT'S GUIDE TO CHESS - also great for teachers) and get a good solid beginning text book (several good ones out there) that has good lessons plans and a good tactics book (kids love chess problems (i.e. HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS or SIMPLE CHESS TACTICS) - along with a demonstration board and the chess sets your have everything you need!"
5,Excellent movie which discusses very hard topics.,"I do not want to spoil this for viewers.It takes place in a small dinner (1950s style) and Jesus is the short order cook. It does sound kind of hokey, but it is not. The characters are well developed. The dialogue is excellent. The portrayal of Jesus is solidly biblical. The acting is superb.I really liked the very deep and tough spiritual questions which were brought up. Realistic answers, and realistic questions put to God.Great movie."
4,"Great message, mediocre acting",Fantastic message but the acting left a lot to be desired. It did keep your attention but got kind of slow in parts. Too bad they had tom portray the cop as being the devil but I guess someone had to be the bad guy.
3,"OK, But. . .","The film was okay, but a bit pedestrian. I thought the acting was very wooden and it could have been better written. However, I liked the actor that played Jesus. A little too pat for me."
4,Guy Clark for beginners,"This is such a great Guy Clark CD. I'm not usually a fan of ""live"" CDs but Guy is in fine form. I wish I had seen the broadcast, and will be looking for it in the future. I guess if I don't ever catch it there's always the DVD.If you buy music for someone and want to give them the music of Guy Clark this would be an excellent one to get. I would suggest getting one for you too!"
2,Problem disconnecting it,"Good product but it is a bit problematic to safely disconnect product. Light stays on at times. Then next time you use it, you get a message saying last use was not disconnected properly although the computer said that it was safe to disconnect. Definitely keep backup of material on this flash drive."
1,Digital Media Source's 4GB flash drive fiasco,"The first flash drive arrived in a perfectly intact outer envelope, only the NEW product's packaging ripped and shredded. The flash drive didn't work. I contacted Digital Media Source and they told me to package the flash drive carefully since they wouldn't be responsible for damage!!!!!!! They did send a replacement, which also didn't work. I tested in on my Mac, I tested in on my friend's Mac, I tested it on my Gateway PC and my friend's PC. It didn't work. I returned it again. They wrote back to let me know it was my fault, since when they tested it, it did work. I hope for the sake of the next person they send it to that it really does work. I will NEVER do business with Digital Media Source again."
2,U3 not for me,"I am a loyal SanDisk user, but the U3 software that comes on this drive isn't for me and I sent it back. To cumbersome, and even though I found instructions and download, I couldn't remove or disable the software. I like things simple, and his item didn't meet my needs and I sent it back. It is a fast drive, and I could transfer files quickly, but there is no need to add 3-4 mouse additional clicks to install or remove a drive.SanDisk--please make a 2+ GB Flash drive without U3!BL"
5,grrrrreat!!!!!!!!!!!!,"great product. no complaints whatsoever. the jump drive works, works really well and i won't lose it like i have so many others in the past because it's on my keychain."
1,U3 missing,"Some people don't like the U3 software but it works for me. In particular, I like their approach to encryption. I specifically bought this model because the description said it included U3. When I plugged it in, however, there was no U3. I am extremely disappointed.Note: Purchased in Nov 2010 from Digital Media Source."
4,"Great product, poor presentation","I ordered the Cruzer Micro because of my previous good experience with a 256 MB Cruzer for 4 year. I selected this model because of the 4 GB capacity and the U3 features. The product works great, the features are wonderful but the packaging is dismal. The Cruzer is in a flimsy looking plastic casing that feels very weak. After only a few weeks of use by plugging it in and out of computers, I feel that it is loosening. I am afraid that it will fall apart. If a computer has a tight USB port some force needed to be applied to pull it out. By doing that I feel that the case is about to crack. My cheaper and older model has a much stronger casing. I feel that the manufacturer cut corners and put a great product into a cheap casing."
1,Sandisk--Beware their Cust Svc,"Bought one of these a couple months back and had some sort of ""pilot error"" with the U3 feature. Product wouldn't delete it, wouldn't access it. For two solid months I persistently tried to get an RMA (note that 3 months back the price was steeper) and got continual requests for ""What was wrong?"" from three differently accented e-mails for more info, and finally, only a reference to use their redundant no-help Cust. Suppt. notes which wer not applicable to my issues.Bottom line: I finally tossed the POS and bought back in on a cheapo from another mfgr at $20 which works perfectly. U3 might be useful, but it's useless overhead for most data transfer uses. Plus, there are similar, more stable, and free, USB apps available--if needed. Go with a different brand!PS: Hope I never need Sandisk ""help"" with my 4GB Sansa..."
3,Beware of OS incompatibility,"I recently purchased this 4 GB drive for two reasons - the storage and the U3. I am only half satisfied because I discovered only too late that the device is incompatible with Windows Vista. The stick still works as a storage unit, however, but that was only part of the allure.I seems that the U3 element of this USB drive is hardcoded, and this particular stick has a device version that is incompatible with any Vista upgrade (merely upgrading the Launch Pad software is useless).So, I must warn against purchasing this device, unless you plan on sticking with XP for much longer."
2,Wrong ScanDish Advertised,"The 4.0 G SanDisk that was received was not the 4.0 G ""Password Protected"" SanDisk Flash Drive ordered. The 3 received did not have the Cruze U3 function which is San Disk ""password"" software. I have found out from SanDisk that they no longer make the 4.0 G with ""Password Protection"".For the ones received and returned the price plus the shipping and handling is not competative. You can walk in Wal-Mart and buy them every day for less than $ 10.00. There is too many hidden charges in the ""Shipping and Handling"" charges that could be a problem."
4,I haven't had any problems with it,"I took the advice of some others and removed the U3 software before I even tried to use it. Since I did that, it works just like the cruzer minis and micros that I have been using for the last couple years.I use it mostly for holding video clips, which it is fast enough to play one mpeg (or similar) of medium quality at a time without getting choppy. It would be too choppy for DVD or VCD quality files."
1,Mac compatibility issue,"Weirdly, this product accepts files from my Mac at home, but when I plugged it into my Windows 2000 workstation at the office, I got an error message from Windows saying it cannot accept this hardware."
3,"A good book, but there isn't enough detail.","I read this book and it's a fairly good reference. It's just such a skinny book without much content. I was disappointed that it did not contain very much information. I was hoping for a big, fat text book type reference!"
5,Mighty Powerful Echoes,"The Mighty Echoes are the most fantastic group to join the music industry in years. Their voices, harmony, energy, and obvious joy performing their songs, should not be missed by anyone enjoying good music and a trip into the past.The A Cappella rendition of the music makes the songs authenic and appealing. I would wager that no individual could keep from tapping their foot or singing along...I certainly could not."
4,Bunn Coffee Brewer,"I purchased this coffee brewer for the office. We previously bought the $99.00 Bunn's from various shopping centers and they just didn't last and had overflow problems regularly. Since purchasing this one, I have not heard any complaints and everyone in the office thinks it's absolutly wonderful.I gave it 4 stars mainly because we have only had it for a month."
1,No heat....,"First thanks to Amazon for the good return policy.Bought the VP 17-1 because we want hot coffee, per standard..195-200plus brewing.Sick of buying Chinese junk that fails fast. Have been buying two percolators per year.So we decided to buy a commercial Bunn, an American product known to be reliable.Heated water at nozzle 175-182, measured many ways never near 195 plus. Coffee weak and not hot. Did not want to return so I called Bunn. The nice man there suggested something so I tried it. Still not up to standard.Where is Bunn quality control? Are you using Chinese components?Why lose a customer willing to pay up for quality????"
2,What's the fuss about?,"I normally enjoy Oate's work, especially her editing and short stories, but this book is weak. It's incredibly predictable, fantastically boring, and was a struggle for me to finish. The only redeeming feature is that it is a fairly accurate portrayal of male motives to be written be a female"
1,What a disappoitmant!,"I bought this album because i thought it will be like a ""weird al"" yankovic version for one of the greates albums of all time - the dark side of the moon by pink floyd. Instead, I got a record by a little group that just took the album and recorded the classic album again - and very poorly - DO NOT BUY IT! It's not funny at all... and if you want a good album, just buy a pink floyd album!"
2,Better compilations exist,"This cd is just another repackaging of the pre-Steely Dan demos that Becker and Fagan recorded way back when. If you can get past the often rough sound quality, as I am sure any Dan fan can, there's nothing wrong with the material. In fact, most of it is great. But this release doesn't include all of it. There are better, more complete reissues of this material available. Check out ""Android Warehouse"", or any of the 2-cd sets of this era for a much better and more definitive collection."
2,Gave me a rash and also stopped working,"Pros: Cute design for an inexpensive sports watchCons: Stretchy rubbery band can irritate skinNeutral: Mine stopped working ... maybe a fluke?This watch stopped working after a few weeks. I don't know why. I didn't bang it up, and though I wore it in the shower, it's supposed to be water resistant.Also, the rubber textured band gave me a rash on my wrist. I have mildly sensitive skin, but have never gotten a rash from a watch band before. The rubber doesn't let your skin breathe, and because it has a little stretch to it, you can't really wear it loosely either.Cute design though, and Timex is a decent brand, so maybe mine stopped working as a fluke. If you've got rash-resistant skin and want to give this watch a try, you'll probably have better luck (maybe?) than I had."
3,Shall we dance?,"This is a fine book for folks who haven't danced for a long time. For seniors, like myself, it quickly reviewed the steps I had forgotten. The diagrams are excellent. However, I was not able to get my teen-age granddaughters interested in the book. It does not cover their kind of dancing."
2,Perfect size - not the best quality,Granddaughter loves the table. It is the perfect size for a 4-6 year old and should last until she is at least 10. The first one we received was poor quality with a bad finish. The 2nd one looked better but the finish is already starting to chip after 6 weeks of intermittent use. We will be stripping and refinishing ourselves to get a better quality appearance.
3,Great product for the price!!!,"I saw one review that was awful but bought the table and chairs anyway because of the price. Everything was in the boxes and in good shape. I put it all together very quickly and easily.The only thing was that on both chairs one leg was about an 1/8th of an inch shorter then the others so they wobbled a bit. I had some padded tape (not sure what the real purpose for it is) and cut a piece to go under that leg,it worked great and you can't see it. If I had the table in a room with carpet I probably wouldn't notice the wobble but it is in a room with hardwood floors.Overall I am very happy with it. The construction is very sturdy and my 21 month old loves them!"
4,"Solid, but easily scratches","The set is solid and nice, but scratches easily. I was not happy with the vendor, ""Serena's"". They charged me $50.00 for shipping and were impolite and condescending in their email to me when I inquired about it. I will not advice anyone to purchase from them. Find this item somewhere else."
5,I love it! its very Sturdy.,"I love this table, although it is a little heavy, it is also good quality and it will last my son many years. We get up every morning and eat breakfast and do some at home work, he also loves his big boy table. It was very easy to assemble myself with a little help from my 1 year old son... Get it and enjoy!"
4,A different side of Laetitia,"I liked this CD and am gald these songs are not on a Stereolab album where they might have been asked to carry a bit more weight or fit into a concept, mood or sound; here the songs are like little clockwork animations that are wound up and allowed to run around on the tabletop in their own safe place. The sound palette is similar to Stereolab's earlier albums but lighter on drums and guitars. There is an intimate feel to the vocals and the production has preserved the bedroom 4-track feel to great effect. It's like being invited to tea at Laetitia's house for tea rather than going to a concert.My favorite tracks are Cache Cache, Witch Hazel and Vol de Jour (which tells the story of a versatile cardboard box)."
4,so beautiful...,"I love this cd and here's why -- you don't really NEED to know French to enjoy it. The vocals are so haunting and heartbreaking in some tracks and so uplifting in others that the language is practically universal. Je l'aime! I also love how low key and experimental it is. I have never really listened to French pop, but if all of it is this superb, I want to kick myself for listening to all the other crap that's been polluting my ears. Good job, Monade... I hope you come out with more music soon!"
5,Good for my son,"This is the same book that the adult learning center uses in Richmond, VA right now so I was glad I got it."
5,Excellent GED book!!!,The best GED Book! Very helpful:)This book prepares a student to take the new GED test in a focused manner. The pre-test provides an excellent prescription of they student's strengths and weaknesses. Best one volume preparation book on the market.
5,Complete GED Preparation by Steck Vaughn,This will be used for a community GED program. All subjects are available in just one book.
3,"A good album, but a bit overpriced","This isnt the kind of album where you try to find the deeper meaning of the songs. It's a fun punky album and makes good background music. Some of the songs remind me of a group called Less Than Jake....if you like that, you should buy this."
3,Mother of a 3 yr old,"My daughter does love this. She does not seem to mind the partial screen. Although as said in another review, you can adjust with a wheel. Not that big of a deal. Should be $10 or less.. but things we parents do for our own little princesses want to be's!!! :) Not a total regret buy, would even buy the belle one. But she is 3!!!"
5,Characters with depth and an exciting read,"This author is a student of human nature, and her characters have real human qualities as well as magical abilities. One believes in their humanity and cares about them. The medieval-like setting of her universe is fascinating, as are the indirect references to Aboriginal history and culture. It was an exciting read, and I was sorry to have to put it down. Now I can't wait for the next one."
4,Great looking bag!,"Great looking bag! Love the color & finish. My 15"" laptop is a snug fit directly into the bag. Can not use the padded sleeve provided for my laptop (could be useful for smaller laptops). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I could use a little more room in the bag for other stuff. Right now I can fit my laptop w/charger & wireless mouse, eReader w/charger, iPhone w/charger and my long large wallet, if I organize it well. Small, thin makeup case may also fit in for your travels."
2,not the best guide--poorly written,"this guide is written poorly and does not compare with lonely planet. The authors of this book were definitely more concerned with being cute than informative. Their jokes weren't even funny and their instructions often very poor. Luckily, I had a great time in Rome despite them, having bought a much better guide as well as this one."
1,Let's Go...Or Let's Not,"Of all the tour books I used in my recent trip to Italy (and considering I'm a tour book junkie I used quite a few), Let's Go Rome was the worst. Although allright for a guide to the sights (although I believe their policy must be if it sells tickets, it goes in the book regardless of quality) it's recommendations for everything else were terrible. By the end of our trip my companion wanted to ceremonially burn the book. Enough said?"
5,A Truly Transforming Book,"I have done yoga on and off for the last few years, along with other exercises for variety. After a debilitating back injury that forced me to give up all other forms of exercise (at least for the moment), I found Baron's book. The first time I did Child's Pose, Downward Facing Dog, and Rag Doll, with his excellent descriptions, my back felt stretched, and most important, pain free! For the first time in a month I had hope that my back would actually heal again.I have done yoga every day since then, even though some days I can only manage 10-15 minutes (still building up the endurance). For anyone who has back pain, I urge you to check this book out, and don't be afraid of the poses! Baron is very specific, and his modifications are truly aimed at beginners. This is yoga for everyone - all you have to do is take the first step on your own journey to power. I am grateful that I did.Namaste"
1,PJ,This is a largly contrived and shallow look at yoga (as are baptiste's other books) but it is helpfull with some postures.
5,A very practical guide for single parents,I am a board certified family law attorney. This book addresses many of the day-to-day issues single parents deal with in a very practical way. The book provides great ideas to help keep things simple and workable between parents after a divorce. I would recommend this to anyone who wants their post-divorce experience with their former spouse and children to be positive.
1,this book is a fake!,"This book appears to be a book on the serious subject of American Extremism. However, it is not. This is a book appears to have been written by an American extremist who attempts to ""spin"" the subject of extremism into his ""court"".Look what the author writes in his book: he defends the Klan, (!!) he minimizes the influence of the John Birch Society...AND he focuses on ""extremists"" like the Black Panthers and the Jewish Defense League!"
5,What's Rippin'?,"Keegan Bishop is a terrific skier, but the real question is, can he snowboard? He is about to find out and find out fast in this Rippin' adventure. He finds a wire stretched across two trees and in his direct ski path. He witnesses people putting some snowboards into his team mate's van...they belong to someone else. He over hears them planning to meet at night at the top of the ski run. He gets to the top of the ski run and he has already been spotted. The guy has a gun, he hasn't yet mastered snowboarding yet, but he needs to get help and get help fast! A girl's life is in danger and so is his own! Read this book, it's great!"
2,Not pleased,"Bought this diffuser to go with the VS 784 blow dryer as it was a recommendation from Amazon. This diffuser did not fit the blow dryer as the dryer has a ""hump"" on it and the diffuser will not slide on to the dryer. Might work with a different blow dryer. Amazon should not show this diffuser with this particular model of blow dryer as it gives people the impression that they go together when in fact they do not."
4,Vidal Sasson VS624 Universal finger Diffuser Attachment,"I searched all over for a diffuser after my beautician told me I should have one to keep my natural curls in a new hairstyle I've been wearing and I got this one because I knew it would fit the hair dryer I had but I'd give it 5 stars, instead of 4, if the fingers weren't quite as long."
5,"Simple, but hypnotic...","This is Jane Siberry's least commercial album, and this is what makes it so wonderful. It is simple, personal, quiet and comfortable. I like the way she can look back at herself with a bit of humour, commenting between songs on the over-emotional girl she used to be, but at the same time reproducing and respecting the first impulses that brought these songs out. For a teenager, she sure wrote wonderful lyrics, which I find myself singing over and over again in my head. This truely is one of Jane Sibbery's greatest works."
5,LOVE THESE SHOES!!!!,I ordered these shoes because I thought they were cute and someone else had written a really great review of them. They were everything I hoped they would be. They fit true to size and are very comfortable! They arrived a week earlier that expected too!
5,Loves Studying Spanish,"This book has been a great addition to my ever-growing library of Spanish books as I'm a life-long learner, and lover, of the language. I purchased this book to help my high school daughter with her class work, and I've found it to be one of the best books in my library! I say this because it offers grammar, stories, and a host of other things aimed at helping the learner process inforamtion in the best way that works for that particular learner! I especially like the parts called Palabras Clave (Key Words) in each section because the words are given in Spanish AND they are defined in Spanish (with examples of usage)! This aids in my ability to ""think Spanish"" which is not as quickly achieve when learning the word in Spanish and then learning the meaning in English. Overall, it's a great addition..."
1,Do Not Buy this!,The company who makes this software set it up to be only used if you register the software. Which would be fine but the website is no longer up. So the software is useless!
1,Go to 1/2 Price books,"Do not, Do not, Do Not! buy this horrid product. My one complaint it doesn't work, if you want decent editing software use the software that comes with your respective operating system, Other than the fact that this software does not bloody well work, it just looks abilmaly bad. the screen is some odd magenta color. If one needs video editing due to system issues, look at the 1/2 price book store."
2,Total junk,"I purchased this dispenser and was a little upset to get the pink one. They should give you a choice of colors, I have FOUR boys!!! The color didn't matter for long because the silly thing cracked and broke within one week of gentle use. The plastic is just too hard! I much prefer the Avent dispenser. It's a much better plastic and the formula doesn't seem to shift as much."
1,run away now!,"Didn't keep powder separated and made a huge mess trying to pour all the powder from on compartment into a bottle because of where the spout is. You have to shake it a bit to get it all out then you have powder leaking from other sides, pain in the neck! Not to mention it is hard as heck to clean. I will stick to using recycled baby food jars for my formula!"
3,Be ware of the colors you get,I ordered for the colors I've seen. But they send me another color. I'm sorry this color is not for my boy. I'm not going use it and it's not worth to return it.
2,Makes little sense.,"If Spielberg wanted to make the point that violence begets violence, he should have spoken through other characters. I find it hard to believe that the squad sent by Mossad, the most effective intelligence organization in the world, would be a group of self-doubting amateurs who could be taken in by a girl in a bar. For a good twenty years preceeding the events in the film, the Israelis successfully hunted down escaped Nazis all over the world. For the squad to have to buy information from a French family isn't believable either."
2,More horrible direction from Spielberg and a pathetic pseudo-psychological script,"Good grief, what a load. Get this: after Palestinian terrorists murdered a large group of Israeli athletes at the Olympics (this actually happened) the Israeli version of the CIA, the Mossad (according to Spielberg's pathetic mental gyrations) selected a small group of untrained assassins to locate and kill the terrorists, wherever they were. And oh! the anguish these assassins suffered! Vey is mier! Poor tortured souls they were! Murder most foul! Revenge--is this Jewish? Mammanyu! The only person who actually acts in this movie is the superb French actor Mathieu Amalric whom you may know from The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, is which he is stupendous. Congratulations to him for obviously not listening to a word Spielberg told him. Oh, and the musical score. To poop on."
2,not that interesting,"i thought it was going to be like a book page turner, however, Iwas disapointed.Ido not recomend this video"
5,a females point of view,"i enjoyed this movie, the characters were real, easy to follow, good from beginning to end. very interesting movie."
2,A Speilberg dud,Schindlers List did not come to mind watching this movie. I found it long and boring and had all I could do to stay awake to its conclusion. An interesting subject but I remember the news magazines at the time telling a more interesting story...
1,Terrible,"All right i have to say this, its a plain cheap piece of plastic.The first time my cell phone dropped from it at home, thank God there was carpet. After that i made sure that i had it in secure in the two small inward edges on the top of the cell phone,well but my cell phone popped out again this time on a pavement, giving it a scratch and chippingoff some paint... my heart was in my mouth.... this happened again the third time and this time i got a seriously paint chip off my phone so damn visible....and I threw this piece of trash away. Its got something to do with the size its not tight enf to hold your phone and your phone just pops out... highly N_O_T recommended..."
2,ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT,The quality of this recording is terrible ... notes and sounds are muffled and often sounds like there are two songs being recorded at the same time. NOT recommended.
3,book,this is a ok book. it is a lot older book but good to start off on. It was worth what i paid for it
3,"No Errata! Thank You, SAMS Publishing Company","The URL for obtaining the errata provided in the book... is inoperative. SAMS Publishing web site provides no help either. (In fact, the website's search capability is also broken.) So there you have it. A book frought with errors has a faulty errata link. All that irony for a list price..."
4,Great but not that Great.,"This is my 2nd book regarding php and mysql. My first one got stolen a while back. Anyways, This is a great resource for those who want to create php dynamic and interactive web pages. The codes are good but ive seen better. With this book, You could start making php in no time at all. Samples are interesting and the codes could be used to jump start your own projects. I recommend this for beginners and mid-level php programmers.PS: I spilled coffee on mine :("
2,Good for practice; too many errors.,"I like the premise of one problem per day each week. I like the variety of problems to be solved. However, there are way too many incorrect answers in the back of the book!"
3,Needs Availability for More Platforms,"A great old game. Needs to be made for newer platforms (e.g. Playstation II, III, WII, etc)"
2,not a hit,"My child did not really like it and it broke within a couple months. My child really did not like tummy time though, so it may not have totally been the fault of the toy."
5,Mark Twain...Handbook for the Damned Human Race,I gave this book to my husband for Christmas. He had attended a conference this past summer on Mark Twain's writings andwas thrilled to receive this book
2,OK,There is a reason why Boston has discontinued this product....the HD doesn't work well if you do not get good reception. It can vacillate between the hd and analogue causing a weird bassy sound or an echo or it won't turn on if the reception is off. Probably great if you live in a city.
4,A good radio needs good antenna,"I really like this radio. The sound quality for such small speakers is supberb--they have a depth and prescence that is surprising for such a small radio. Beware, however, that the ""pigtail"" antenna that comes with the radio is nearly useless. Most of these units now come with an additional ""T"" dipole antenna in the box. In most urban areas the folded dipole ""T"" antenna will give you better reception. But to truly enjoy everything that this radio has to offer you will need to mount an outside FM antenna--particularly if you live in a rural area. I went with a Winegard omnidirectional FM antenna on a five foot mast mounted at the peak of my roof. I can receive FM stations more than 100 miles away and several HD stations. Even the analog-only broadcasts come in clear as a bell. For a radio this expensive it is really worth shelling out the extra bucks for a rooftop antenna (antenna, mast, mouting brackets and 50' coaxial cable came to around $90)."
3,Reception depends on your area.,"This radio had a great sound. --on the stations I could get. I only live 20 miles from Philadelphia, yet I could not get reception on my favorite HD station which is based in Philadelphia. Maybe the station needs to have a stronger signal, but for now I'll just listen to it on my computer."
4,A good HD radio,"I first used this radio when I worked in I.T. for a cluster of local radio stations that broadcast in HD, so I already knew what I was getting. I use this model as a bedroom clock radio, with the radio on one nightstand and the second speaker extended to the other nightstand. I've been very pleased with the performance of the radio in this application. The only drawback I found was the reconditioned radio did not include the remote control."
2,"HD? Yeah, right...","Let's start with a reality check. AM & FM, even if in ""digital"", still sound like a tape. I've heard all the hype, and that's all it is. Save your money, buy a better external antenna and just get a better signal for your standard radios."
3,Nice radio. Sounds great when loud.,"I rate it four stars, (the three stars was an accident and I can't change it now). I received my radio as a gift, and as a clock radio it works well, you can set the time and the turn-on volume separately for each alarm. I am in north Jersey, so NY has lots of HD stations, I found at least 7 or 8 the first day, and they all have HD2 and even HD3 stations. I welcome the additional variety that NY now has with the HD2 stations. I don't listen to AM so I can't tell you about that. On the down side the radio does have too much bass unless you turn it up. The volume adjusts from 1 to 100, and for any setting below 30 the bass is too much, from 30 to 46 it starts to clear up, and above 50 it sounds great. The presets are not as nice to use as many other radios I have used, but not counting the bass thing, HD radio does sound better than analog radio."
2,"Initial high hopes, but very disappointed","Having seen this radio advertised in so many places, I was excited about trying it. However, I am very disappointed and will be taking it back to the store today. The reception is horrible, there is no seek option, you cannot change the amount of base (which is too much for me), it requires AC power, and it is way overpriced. The little wire antenna it comes with is laughably bad for such an expensive unit. Honestly, my 20 dollar boombox can get way more stations. one HD signal I was able to pick up kept going in and out every two seconds, and what I heard wasn't worth it anyway. Maybe this technology will get better in the future, but it is clearly not yet ready for prime time."
1,Poorly written,If this book is for dummies then I must be an idiot. There are major gaps in the logic and it assumes that you have done lots of programming before getting this book.Don't waste your money
1,Hide all sharp objects...,"I'm in total agreement with Chuck and especially Jerad. This book is poorly organized and poorly written. Contrary to the basic concept of the ""For Dummies"" series, Mr. Trinko does not clearly and concisely explain the concepts of AppleScript. The book is overflowing with off topic, idiotic attempts at humor which make it very hard to read by breaking your concentration and the flow of information (if there was any to begin with).The title is very fitting however, I for one feel like a world class dummy for buying it."
5,Boy the Rainforest is muggy today!,"What an achivement!Uh....Is this Robert Plant?No, Butthead. Beavis shoulda smacked you upside the head for that one."
5,Benefit High Beam,What a fabulous find! This gives a subtle shine on cheeks and eyelids...anywhere you need a bit of sparkle. What a huge difference it makes!
5,Great Game,"I played Starcraft, Warcraft, AOE among other titles and loved all of them. One thing that always bothered me was the lack of huge armies. In Cossacks, this is not a problem. I just got the game a week or so ago and have played it constantly. The most men I once had at one time was around 800 guys running around killing everyone in sight and the game ran perfectly. I strongly recommend this game. The graphics are gorgeous although the sound is just ok. Its a little harder i think then AOE but much more enjoyable. ..."
3,Great...if you're into napoleanics.,"Decent graphics for the huge number of units. Moderate variety among nations. Very playable. Enjoyable endgame;whereas many games become tedious once victory is a foregone conclusion,this one makes razing the enemies town epic and fun. The computer player is too easily outsmarted by any serious gamer (although this is a problem common to many games)."
5,"For all you AOE, AOK and AOK:Conquerers Fans","I'm an avid AOK:Conquerers player and I NEVER thought I would find a game that would blow it away. I've found it!!! The graphics are stuning. The detail in the buildings is extreme. The trees really look like trees. The peasants and military units perform their tasks with an almost lifelike grace.Rifles, cannons mortars etc. all have different sounds and all produce puffs of smoke when they fire. The artillary bombardments are spectacular; actual explosions and clouds of smoke and flying debris when they hit a target.The ships are very lifelike, especially in their movements.Forget the 200 maximum on units... I just finished my first run thru on this game and had a maximum population limit of 1000 and could have gone higher. There are also LOADs of unit upgrades.On a scale of 10 I rate this one a definate 12!!"
4,Predictable but pleasant,"This book was predictable but most bodice rippers are predictable; after all, if the hero and heroine didn't fall in love it wouldn't be much of a love story. This is one of those little books that you can finish in one sitting. Even though Molly and Hart started out at loggerheads, they were both very likeable characters and I wanted to see what would cause them to resolve their differences. When Molly was kidnapped and Hart was injured trying to rescue her, I thought, ""Yep. That'll do it!"" I see that Ms. Raleigh has written a lot of books and I have added her to my list of authors whose books I will be searching for. It wasn't ""War and Peace"" but I greatly enjoyed this book!"
5,The best of his best!,"I recently bought a boom box to play my cassettes. While playing El Mejor Freddy Fender, the player ate my tape. :(I never thought I'd find a replacement, but I found this download on Amazon. I love Freddy Fender. I was lucky to have my picture taken with him years ago. When I play his music...he lives on. It's all in Spanish (I don't speak it), but I know the songs. Gotta love all of his music!"
2,Faulty connections,"So frustrating. Test at home and they work fine... then beep beep beep for no reason? We sent back twice and got a new radio, but found the problem in the connection at the head set. So far we went through 4 head sets and all had problems with the wires braking in the plug. Sometimes when they worked it was great. Also there are too many buttons for functions and you can not adjust volume easily, so if it's just a short distance and you don't put in ear plugs the volume is set too loud."
2,Lousy sound makes them useless,"Got these because they seemed good for the price. Got the full face helmet set up as well. The speakers that you attach to the inside of the helmet are just plain garbage - the only time we could hear each other (riding on two different bikes) was at a stop; anything more than a few mph and we couldn't hear anything despite turning things up as best we could. Earplugs would work but there is no set up for this. Without sound, might as well not have this as I could get the same thing from a cheap set of walkie-talkies from WalMart. This could truly be a very nice and inexpensive set up if Nady could fix the sound issue but, until they do, I definitely could not recommend this unit."
5,Very fast delivery,"The Amerock knobs are very nice and well crafted, I would recommend them to anyone who is building a new house or remodeling."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED (one star is too generous),"this was a mistake on my part to buy.I was not impressed, I thought it would be a whimsical look at how couples have gotten along for so long. Was I wrong. I was then happy to send it back the very day I recieved it.This was on a list of possible Valintines gift. Well if your going to break up, then yes buy it for your partner. Other wise, NOT!!"
3,Vits and Bites,"I bought these because they are cheap and im kinda broke, but they do supplement your diet well not recommended if you have 30$ extra a month to spend on a good liquid multi but NOW is a brand I trust and will always be a main stay in my supplement cabinet : )"
3,Good product,"I trust Now brand and use it for most suppliments. This is a good vitamin, at a good price. Is it the best vitamin out there? No. Is it the worst? No.For the price, it is a worthy purchase from a good American company."
2,Hat is made in China,"The appearance the cap is very nice. However, after 2 days of wearing the cap very proudly, I noticed that on the bottom side of the tab inside the cap, is written ""Made in China"". If I had known that this cap is being made by China, I would never have purchased a cap that represented my service to our Country. I try to buy products that are made in America! The cap was supposed to represent me and my Country and not a product from China!"
5,"""The"" Nam Cap","Great looking cap....feels good, good quality and it says it all. I highly recommend it."
5,Celebration -- Simple Minds amazing guitar-based roots,"Celebration is an early compilation of Simple Minds primarily guitar-based music. Long before their American popularity with the single ""Don't You Forget About Me"" and even prior to the now famous ""New Gold Dream"" album, there existed the ""post-punk era"" Simple Minds.Now more than twenty years old, Celebration is, at times, darker than other Simple Minds albums. This darkness, however, only serves to demonstrate the many facets of one of the finest, and enduring bands of the past two decades.Celebration belongs in every fan's Simple Minds collection."
5,THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHIRT,THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE T-SHIRTS I HAVE PURCHASED IN YEARS.VERY DURABLE CONSTRUCTION AND GREAT GRAPHICS
2,Cheap plastic spout ruins otherwise nice kettle,"I echo the other comments. My kettle spout broke apart after about 1 year, and now my otherwise beautiful and functional kettle is defective and incomplete. I have not found a way to purchase a replacement spout. I'm especially disappointed because I searched for a long time to find this kettle--unlike any other kettle I found, there is no seam in the construction of the kettle (the part that holds the water) and I had believed this to be a sign of good quality."
3,Misrepresented product,"Unfortunately, this Teakettle appears to only be available in enameled Red from Amazon, when I ordered it, it had been labeled brushed stainless steel. Amazon paid for an exchange and promptly sent me another red enameled teakettle. Needless to say they paid for the full return and now have labeled the kettle appropriately Red enamel. The picture misrepresents the description now as it indeed is still a brushed stainless steel kettle.It looked nice, but I didn't take it out of the box."
1,this is [junk]!,"This release is the worst Supersuckers cd I have heard! The mid-fi production is terrible. And the songs are'nt much better. As a longtime Supersuckers fan I dont understand how this album was ever released. With masterpieces like Smoke of Hell, La Mano Cornuda, and Sacrilicious, this album has no punk overtones and is stictly a rock only offering. Save your money and go see one of their live shows instead."
5,An entertaining and fascinating book by a gifted writer.,"Once again, McPhee has revealed the fascinating hidden sides to a number of subjects which at first appear ordinary. He is The Master at popularizing Earth Science, and shows why in the most entertaining manner.Others more talented than I, and who make a living reviewing books, have already reviewed and praised this book. I have a question of the publisher, though. At the front of the book, below the card-catalog data, is the following statement: ""A NOTE ON THE BINDING The die on the front of the binding -Lazy J Over Running M Combined- was created by Ellie Wyeth Fox for the author"". Where is this die (cattle brand?) to be found? I looked all over my copy of this book and could not find it anywhere."
1,Misleading information on product-Honka Hoota Horns,"The information for this product clearly reads: ""Honka Hoota Horns (Assorted Colors, BOX OF 24)"". I was pretty angry after receiving just ONE horn. Why would I spend that much for shipping and for the product itself to only get ONE horn?Do not buy this product unless you only want one.I will not be buy anything from Paragon Sports after this misleading+frustrating shopping experience."
3,This CD isn't there yet...,"I'm a big N7 fan, but this CD was recorded at a time before they adopted their signature mind-blowing instrumental sound. This album is just another acapella album. Look for their ""What is it?"" or ""Ready II Fly"" albums if you want to hear something truly amazing."
2,"If they forgot about MS-Backup, what else did they forget?","A large and ponderous work lacking any reference to Microsoft Backup. I suppose, in writing about such a complicated subject as Windows 98, minor errors of ommission are inevitable. But, to omit such an important subject (where would any computer user be without backup), seems negligent. With so many reference books on Windows 98 flooding the market, why bother with this one. Additionally, the writing style is tedious and the screen-shot reproductions are muddied."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I purchased this item for my husband for Christmas. After 4 mos. the CD player stopped working. Amazon does not replace items after 30 days and Coby only has a 90 day warranty on their CD players, DVD players, etc. However, they will replace headphones up to one year. If you really want this item, I suggest you purchase the extended warranty to cover this junk."
2,a documentary with not much depth,"Possibly a good attempt at opening up some an a legendary and sick punker, but the problem here is that it was made by too much of a fan--in the end, GG shows himself to be sociopathic and cowardly (revealed more in the bonus footage of his last show than in the documentary itself), finding identity more from whichever personality he can leech onto at the time than presenting his own, but the film didn't seem to want to acknowledge this. There's a nice focus on the effect of GG Allin, and would have worked well as a documentary about those around him (band and fans), but this film offers you little on GG Allin himself, though it seems to want to make him its focus."
3,Its OK ! Does its Job,"For those of you that really wants a great facial steam, this product doesn't neccessarily perform the greatest. Its good but it doesn't cover the entire face. With a facial steam, you want to be able to cover the entire face --- in this case, I would suggest going to the gym where they have a STEAM ROOM. But again, this product is not a bad buy... i just don't use it much after 1-2 uses.. because i don't think the effect is really great."
3,conair facial,"ok i must say for this the spin brush is great i dont think you can find a spin brush this cheap and works like its cost lots of money. when using the sauna it got really hot twice and on the third try it didnt get hot at all but the spin brush is still working great it takes two batterys and you can use any facial cleaner and use the brush to scrub it in more its not to soft and not to hard. the shipping was only three days. i would have to say if you are looking for a great sauna for the face this is not it but if you are looking for a great scrub the spin brush is great and well you get to use the sauna twice or maybe it might work longer for you, and i just had a faulty product. but after using the sauna my face felt really clear like it could breath and then to scrub it with the brush and wash it after my face felt clean and after that twice of using it i saw some good inprovements my face got more clear of dark spots and pore got smaller."
2,Not too useful,"Maybe I am just lazy, I use it only two times so far since I have it for almost 1 year. It is an OK, but not really necessary....."
1,garbage!,"what a piece of garbage. i don't know how this thing got such good reviews. the steam is very very weak. i got it to open my pores, but when i put my face into it. it only steams the lower half of my face. and by the time, i reposition my face to get the upperhalf and have it steamed, my lower face has already dried up.awful. i do not recommend this product. it now sits in my closet doing nothing."
1,Don't buy this!!!,"For those of you who are thinking about buying this and are skeptical, do not buy it!!! The day I got it I was so excited to try it. Well I didnt even get a chance to do that because it did not turn on. They sent me a defected face steamer that would not even turn on! So pissed. I returned it right away. it is cheaply made and it looks like it was made in the .1980's"
5,Love this,"I love this machine. Could I say anymore...I will. I like to keep my face clean, and steam is the easiest, safest and more effective way to do this. It really clears the pores and gets all the gunk out, while adding moisture to the skin, then I rinse with cool water and put on a mask and my skin is happy and clean. You can use it every day, or night and the results will be amazing.It works well for your sinuses too. I put this on my counter and lean over it, just don't wiggle it or hit it while it is on. It has been safe for me and heats up fast. I really love my machine.The brush was great, it worked well to cleanse before the steam, but it isn't waterproof and eventually broke."
1,Do Not Buy!!!!!!,"Do not buy this facial sauna if you are looking forward to any steam coming out of it. I was so disappointed when I first used it, so I used it again to see if I would have a better experience. Well, I didn't. I wish I had never purchased this product. I get much better results and I'm 100 times happier just by boiling water and putting it in a bowl and using that as steam for a sauna. I have not used it since and I do not plan on using it ANYMORE! It's still brand new basically, but I am going to give it away, that's if anyone wants it. Please don't waste your money! I read some of the reviews and decided to get it. I wish hadn't purchased it."
2,Almost junk,"The timer on the device does not work at all. I wonder why they put a non-working part on the device to fool around in the first place. Although it does make steam, it's too hot to bare with no control. After all, it's almost a junk."
2,Disappointing,"I fell for the few good reviews given for this product, which claimed it was so good that it made the skin smooth in just a single use, and Blah Blah Blah..It's not true. The only thing that works about this is the steam, and that too takes about 5-7min to build up. But you don't need to pay this price for just a steam producing machine."
2,Very misleading picture,This is Not at all what I expected. When it said Mega blocks I expected the big version of Legos. The picture makes it look like it's pretty big. This entire truck is only maybe 5 inches long. This is not worth the $20 that I paid for it. Do not buy this if you want a dump truck that can hold anything bigger than 2 inches by 2 inches. Only good thing is it does actually run well on carpet.
4,Sound Hearing,This is an excellent book to understand how various degrees of hearing loss can be for some people. The cassette tape is very beneficial. I have used it when teaching college students who will be working with deaf-blind students and clients. It really helps to understand how even a slight hearing loss can interfer with communication.
3,Adequate--Prefer the iKlear Cleaning Kit for Widescreen,"The solution dries too quickly on a 17"" Mac screen. I always find myself using 2-3 packets until I think the screen is sufficiently free of airborn particles, fingerprints and residue left over from the sole use of polish singles.The iKlear Cleaning Kit is more than adequate for my needs, although a bit expensive for it's size. With one application, the iKlear solution and the large or travel-size micro-chamois cloth not only cleans, but indeed polishes both the screen and entire notebook casing.For me, the iKlear Cleaning Kit is the better choice."
4,Chicago's Singer Goes Solo Again,"Bill Champlin (Chicago's Singer) steps out for another solo CD called ""Burn Down The Night"". It also features Steve Lukather(Toto) & Bruce Gaitsch (Richard Marx) on Guitar & Joseph Williams (Toto Singer) on background vocals. I like ""Highest Stakes"", ""When Love Comes Around"", ""Still Woth Saving"" & ""In Love Too Long"". Champlin is a vocalist/Guitarist who has worked with (REO Speedwagon, Airplay, Dakota, Jimmy Harnen, Ray Kennedy, King Of Hearts, Prism, David Roberts, What If & the late Van Stephenson). I give it 4 out of 5 stars."
3,Live concert,"The music is not bad, if you like L. Subramaniam's music at all. What wasn't advertised that this was a Live concert, which I personally don't like much (those clapping really destroy flowing of music). Sound isn't perfect, but considering it was recorded in 1986, it's fine."
2,Falls Apart,"This is my third Timex Ironman Triathlon watch and I should have learned my lesson. The strap falls apart in less than a year of very mild use (never even exposing it to water). This is the third time the strap glue of one of these watches has failed, thus making it impossible to wear. I would NOT recommend this product and the Timex company should stand behind their watches - they refuse to accept defections other than for the clock function itself. A definite rip off."
3,Not happy.,"I bought this for my daughter in August. The band that holds the strap in place has already broken and according to the warranty, this is not covered under their warranty. In my opinion, this product was not worth the money since it is broken already."
1,not working in the swimming pool,"It states 100 ft water resistance. However, it won't work for a 3-foot swimming pool. Won't buy any Timex product. Period."
2,Falls apart,"Initially, I really liked this watch. It's comfortable, does everything I need, and worked well in the pool. But . . . after a few months, one of the plastic pads on the main function button fell off, leaving the metal pin underneath exposed, but still working.After a few more months, all 4 pads fell off, leaving 4 exposed pins that would catch on everything and gave me a few nasty scratches. When the battery died, I took the watch to a watch shop to have the battery replaced. Since I swim, I wanted a knowledgeable person to replace the battery to keep the watch waterproof. Well, after the seal was broken, all the functions stopped working, audible alarms, stopwatch, timer, and light. Only the time still functioned. Then I took a trip to a river with my family. Even though I wasn't submerged, just playing in the water, the face developed condensation and the next day everything died. The watch is inexpensive, but I sure expect it to last longer than the life of the battery."
3,watch,"I can't figure out how to get it to count laps, which is the reason I got it. It is water proof and works well."
2,The Swingin' 70;s,"This work isn't exactly trash, it's a very 1970's morality story with an unlike, almost anti-hero behaving very much like a Swinging London jet-setter. It follows the 70's fashion/sexuaity formula with Mr. Follet's usual characters. Very similar to ""The Executioner,"" By Don Pendleton, the book that defined the action/adventure genre, this book is more a reflection of the era than a bad work of fiction. While it deserve no awards, it isn't trash either."
1,What trash!,"This was either obviously an early novel of Follet's or his pipe dreams of menage a trois. The plot is ridiculous and the characters shallow. I have read others of yours Mr. Follett, I am glad you have improved."
2,Not sure that this is a Christian album,"This was disappointing for me - the lyrics are watery to the point that it's only possible to use this as light background music.Can you believe that the name Jesus is not mentioned even once in any of the songs? Neither is the cross for that matter. Muslims and Hindus can doubtless listen to this without fear of being offended.There is no question of Kristy's talent - she has a wonderful voice, and the arrangements are good, but the message is nearly non-existent. This is essentially inspirational chewing gum; there is flavour, but no significant nutrients.That said, considering how dangerous much of today's music is, this is not bad as a ""pop"" replacement for families concerned about what their younger members listen to.I'd suggest Jamie Jamgochian, Charlie Hall, Vicky Beeching and Kara Williamson as alternatives with a good blend of message and music quality. These performers leave zero doubt who their God is.Sorry Kristy, try again."
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah","Like other reviewers I had a very hard time getting through this book. The Author gave both too much information and not enough. She would describe the placement of a lamp on a table but not the passage of time. Suddenly characters would be in a new locale, which was expounded upon, but gave little reason or lead up as to how they got there.Also frustrating was the use of accented writing. A little bit of native speech is fine to flavor the writing but the Author went overboard. It got to the point where I had absolutely no idea what was being said.I am glad to see more and more Paranormal Romances being written, but not in this sloppy fashion. Do not pay full price for this book!"
4,Factory farming is cruel,"Okay, if you don't mind being cruel to animals, then I guess it's logical to support factory farms. But the conditions are horrible by any humane standard. Hens are often confined to cages so small that they can't even spread their wings. Beaks are seared off with hot knives to keep them from pecking each other to death. Veal calves are so confined that many of them can barely walk when they are led to slaughter. Animals are routinely neutered without any numbing agents, are transported in all weather extremes, are subjected to drug regimens that cause chronic pain and crippling, and then they die gruesome and violent deaths. Their sad lives are often lived in overcrowded conditions amid terrible stench. Factory farms often pollute the water and air for miles around. Factory farms practice cruelty that would be illegal to perform on a cat or dog. If it's clueless to believe that's wrong, then I guess I'm guilty. But I'd rather be called clueless than heartless."
4,Worth the price!!,My son who is in his final season college level track loves the watch. It is not too bulky and he is quite happy with its features and performance.
2,nie watch but does not work,"The screen keeps going in and out - for a few weeks it works, and then it stops working. the old one I had worked like a charm for years, until the band broke."
3,Worked for about a year...,"Screen just stopped working after about a year of normal use. Never wore in the shower or went swimming in it, washed hands with watch on, maybe thats what did it...It still works, just cant see anything, still beeping every hour...Loved it thought, but don't want this model again, will give 30 lap with Velcro strap a try - last chance for Timex, if that one breaks - thats it..."
1,OK watch. Horrible band.,"The excess retaining band broke after 10 months of use, the entire band broke off after 14 months of use.Typical of timex. OK watch, horrible band.dAnother issue was the light. My old timex was bright enough to find my way about in the dark. This timex only illuminates the numbers and is not bright enough to be useful."
1,HUM DRUM OFFERING FROM REBA,"This music is no different than any of the stuff Reba has been recording for more than a decade and a half now. I really believe she should REALLY go back to her roots and revitalize the ""traditional"" country music movement again. She could do it too! I can pick up a CD of Martina McBride's, Faith Hill or Shania Twain and find the same sounding stuff on theirs as what is on here."
1,3 songs of traditional country are not worth it if the rest is fluff!,This CD is mostly fluff. Even the traditional sounding tunes don't have the substance and are not produced the way traditional country tunes are supposed to be. The CD cover alone with Reba's photograph should indicate that it is ANYTHING but total traditional country. I give this one D-.
5,REBA IS BACK! :),"Reba McEntire has returned to the country music world with her latest release, ROOM TO BREATHE. Her second single from the album, ""Somebody"", went #1 on the Billboard Album charts, and deservedly so. She has 11 other great tracks on this album, including her current single, ""He Gets That From Me"", and other great tracks including ""Moving Oleta"", my personal favorite, which discusses Alzheimer's disease, which affects many individuals and families each year. This album is definitely one you should pick up as soon as possible, and share it with your friends and family. This will make great Christmas gifts this holiday season!"
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,"More Britney Spears like songs. If you like that stuff, this is for you. The Reba McEntire I grew to know and love is long gone! And she isn't coming back with this CD!!!"
1,UNFLATTERING CD COVER IS NOTHING COMPARED TO...,"What's inside. What is inside is simply more of the formulaic, pop wannabe sounds that McEntire has been recording since 1988. The CD cover shows a very unflattering picture of Reba and the photographer should be sued!! But the music inside the CD isn't much better unless you are truly a REBA fan and like what is represented as today's ""country"" music, which is not country!! This is for die hard Reba fans only and if you're looking for older Reba stuff check out ""My Kind of Country"", ""Have I Got a Deal For You"" or the outstanding ""Unlimited"" CD from her ""Mercury"" years! Those are vintage Reba. ""Room to Breathe"" is mediocre Reba."
1,EVERYTHING IS STILL THE SAME,"This is the same formulaic pop stuff Reba has continued to record for years now. The song ""Moving Oleta"" is almost a carbon copy of ""All Dressed Up and Nowhere to Go"" from her ""For My Broken Heart"" album. I'm Gonna Climb That Mountain is exactly like ""Climb that Mountain Higher"" from her ""Rumor Has It Album. ""Somebody"" is along the lines of ""How Was I to KNow""and ""What if Its You"" from the album of the same title. The rest are similar to the things she has always done. I have heard worse from her but also better. She's so wrapped up in the HOllywood scene to make adequate differentiation in her music. Bland stuff."
4,"BETTER THAN ANYTHING SHE'S DONE SINCE ""FOR MY BROKEN HEART""","This CD is quite good, especially since Reba product of the mid to late nineties is quite bad. This one has only one bad song on it...""Secret""....the lyrics are good but what good are lyrics if the melody has no substance and the production are mediocre?? The rest of the CD is substantial with quite a few outstanding cuts on here! ""If I Had Any Sense"", ""Room to Breathe"", ""Somebody"" and especially ""Moving Oleta"" are all great! The highlight are Reba's bluegrass tunes ""I'm Gonna Take that Mountain"" and I especially love ""Sky Full of Angels"" (my favorite song on the CD). Its great!"
2,Not the best,This CD is ok... its not the best I've heard from Reba. I like about 3 of the songs on here. I wouldnt reccommend it to anyone unless you're really a Reba fan.
1,Conair Gel/Lather Machine - HGL 1,"I TRIED TO LOAD A CAN OF GILLETTE FUSION GEL INTO THE MACHINE. IT WOULD NOT RECEIVE THE CAN,BLEW THE GEL ALL OVER THR MACHINE AND CREATED QUITE A MESS. I LOST A CAN OF GEL, THE MACHINE WAS COVERED WITH GEL AND I HAD A HUGE JOB CLEANING IT UP SO I COULD TRY AGAIN WITH SIMILAR RESULTS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND RATE IT ZERO."
5,excellently and plainly written,"this book is a very easy read. there are only about 60 pages but they are absolutely packed full of information and inspiring insights. if you are wanting to learn more about the bible and wanting to know how the bible can be proven to be the inspired word of God, as well as learning more how to read it, this is a book that you must check out. and suprisingly to me J.C. Ryle wrote this in a very understandable manner in very simple english."
1,Scott Knaster would be proud,"Reading the chapters was a breeze. They evoked the ghostly image of of Scott Knaster tickling away at the Apple keyboard, dispensing his wit to lost newbie programmers.That said, as a lite book it does succeed as a breezy tour through the country side. I'm suprised SAMS titled this book, the way they have done.Conclusion: Supplemental reading only."
2,Antenna sucks,You will have to buy a different satellite antenna if you buy this kit. I could never get more than 2/3 signal and the signal I could get cuts in and out a lot. The radio works fine in the other applications I use it for. This may be due to the fact that the radio mount obstruct the antenna on the mount the give you. I just ordered the micro dot antenna which has more gain and a much longer cord and will mount on the rear of the motorcyle and will see what happens.
2,Another Student of Dr. Lotchin,"I am also a student of Dr. Lotchin's, though a current one, taking his class on the history of the American West. What does this have to do with the book? Nothing, except that it is one of the texts we are reading. I found Dr. Lotchin's book to be informative at best, and cluttered, poorly written/edited, and uninteresting at worst. While the history of San Francisco and its rapid growth are astonishing and fascinating, Lotchin's rendering of the city's life from 1848-1856 is something short of spectacular. Most of the problems I have found with the text--including copious grammatical errors which create hard to read passages--could have been remedied with a better editor."
5,Neal has pulled off another ****+ book!,"Kevin Midas is bored at just ""looking"" at Divine Watch so he decides to climb it. He is suprised to find at the top peak a pair of the COOLEST sunglasses. Strangly, when he wears them whatever he says comes true! But after time goes by, these ""wishes"" seem to mean more...I loved how Neal can write from a teenager's point of view. I have not read one bad book by him. I especialy liked this book because the totaly unexpectable things happen throughout it. I TOTALY reccomend it!"
2,MP3,"It is great for making MP3s ... the only problem is that it only allows one to make 20 MP3s before it asks you to go to their web site to buy an unlimited MP3 maker plug-in for the program. At the MP3 site, you have to give all of your information, including credit card number, before you find out what you are paying for the plug-in. Also, I think that they will release your private data to others, or at least that is the way that it appears. It does, however, restore older music very well ... but is it really worth the additional unknown cost when there are other similar products available that are complete when you buy them? I avoided buying the MP3 plug-in come-on and use other programs where the consumer is not duped into thinking he bought a complete product, only to find out that what he bought was not what he thought."
2,"Good intention, but...","This software has some very nice features, easy recording and cleaning of the digital files, everything appears to work great -- until I tried to burn a CD. It will not work if Adaptec is installed on the PC and I have not been able to burn a CD even after I removed Adaptec. The Magix customer support was not able not offer a solution."
2,There has to be something better,"I used Audio cleaning lab to try to clean up a bad live recording. It does a fine job of taking out the hiss but it alters other parts of the original recording, the applause and talking sounds as if it was being heard through a pipe. How about a better sampling rate and a more windows like interface? You get what you pay for."
1,Be Warned,This program does not work with computers pre-loaded with Adaptec's Easy Cd Creator program.
3,Ending left me hanging,"I loved the book at first and could not put it down, however the ending was a major letdown."
2,WHY WHY WHY?,"The book had me totally engrossed, and then the ending justdisgusted me. Seriously, what gives? I hope there is apart two... because the ending was undeserved."
5,Sound value,"This is an ideal product for people who can't afford a full stereo system. The sound is crisp and does'nt give the music that ""tinny"" feel you normally associate with most systems in this price range. The ""dynamic bass boost"" adds a nice oompf to the sound without drowning out the musics' nuances. The radio reception is superb and it has a staggering 30 station preset feature; that's ten more than you get with most systems at twice this price. The easy-to-use remote is truely the icing on the cake and a godsend for lazy people like me who hate having to get up off the sofa to press the skip button on that one annoying song.The only flaw, albeit a small one, is the cassette deck is positioned so low that the tape mechanism does'nt fully eject properly, unless it's positioned on the edge of the table or has say a book underneath. Overall though this is an attractive, great sounding product with a price tag that brings music to my ears and I highly recommend it."
2,Dead after less than 2 months :(,"This camera went dead on me less than two monts light use. Sent to Panasonic Service Center last August 22nd(received there) and until now(Sept 7th) they are still waiting for the part from Japan being shipped by boat!! I can not believe that Panasonic does not have this critical part in stock. Be very careful with this camera. At any rate, i was not also really totally satisfied with the quality of the pictures due to its over-bearing noise reduction system. I will just be happy if they can not be repaired as promised and just give me a refund. I think this will be my 2nd and last Panasonic camera."
5,Great Camera,I bought this camera on Amazon at almost half the original price. The camera is awesome and it has so many features that I recommend after reading the manual that you keep it handle because it close to impossible to remember all of the features. Shooting in auto is very easy and the functions are easy to access. This camera is not extremely complicated to figure out like some. The auto feature is great for point and click people and he stabilization motor is excellent for those with shaky hands. I found that while using the flash my pictures look extremely good. And if you understand lighting the camera will be even better for you it recommends what lighting to use and has a histogram if you need it. Overall this is definitely worth the buy.
3,Pana Fz50,"I think, this Pana. FZ50 is the best camera that you can get, if you do not want to own a SLR. I gave it a three stars, because it does not take AA battery."
1,Get the solutions manual,This book does not have many examples to learn from and what they do have do not make it clear on how to procede with working out the equation. I strongly suggest that you buy the solutions manual for this book if you are able to locate it.
5,This is a Keeper,"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.Serve the Lord with gladness;come before his presence with singing.Know ye that the Lord he is God;it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves;we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.Enter into his gates with thanksgiving,and into his courts with praise;be thankful unto him, and bless his name.For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting;and his truth endureth to all generations.psalm 100Donnie McClurkin understands this passage completely."
3,Beautiful,"A 2 part CD. The first CD is a really lovely album and inspires worships. The second CD, personally speaking, I feel is a bit of a rip off with lots of reprises."
2,Review of Donnie McClurking CD,Excellent praise and worship music. Donnie has a beautiful voice and a great annointing.
5,Pastor Donnie has outdone himself!!,"I enjoyed the first album keeps you on your feet!! I heard one version of ""Days of Elijah"" but I fell in love with this version!! On the second CD, I fell in love with ""Awesome God"" and ""Language Medley""!! Now, I would place those two songs on repeat and listen to those repetitiosly. The man has an anointed voice. As he worshipped and praised God in various languages, listeners did not have to understand what he was saying to get with it. After he translated the lyrics in the songs, I would literally begin to dance!! Even with the beats, you can not help but bob your head!!I pray that this CD blesses you as it has blessed my soul ;-)"
5,"The Best out of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8!","Book one: Entertaining, but too much emphasis on Ms. Scarlet. No wonder that lame teacher never got married. Book two: Good. Read my review for it. Book three: Okay. I gues... Book four: Same as two. Book five: Da Bomb, man! This book is soooooo cool. I hate that lame, idiotic, jerk that tookKristen to the Doggie Chow. One question though: WHY DON'T BRIAN AND KRISTEN GET TOGETHER? I mean, in the book, Brian says ""...I like Kristen. Shes really pretty and nice."" And in the book, Kristen says ""...Brian Rainey. A.k.a. #1 on my cute guy list."" I got some advice for you two: Trust your friend to do the right thing. Wait a minute. Not you Brian."
2,Tedious until the satisfying finale.,"Prepare for hard sustained effort to read through the first three quarters of the book. Tedious and slow. However, Watts does create a detailed realistic underwater world throughout. The final section of the book is where the action, what there is of it, commences and leads to a fascinating conclusion. The final section demands a sequel. In fact, this entire book could be considered a long prequel to a potentially more satisfying and exciting second novel."
5,Incredible,"This is a book that I picked up by chance. Once again, the cover art was what caught my eye. AS well as the teaser on the panel. ""Psychotic"" people under the ocean! Mystifying. I decided to give it a shot. I had nothing to loose. Instantly I was glad I chose it. It started out slow in the Prologue, but as soon as the page turned something new and more mysterious appeared. I loved how Watts described the mental splits and cracks that laid out everything perfectly. Beebe's dreariness added to the affect that the crew were outcasts of society.The author added another element- The cruelty of the GA. And the crew's utter hatred for the ""mechanic."" Every little detail seemed to fit in at one time or another. This book is fabulous and captivated me from the start. I'm sure that all you out there will take my advice and read this book. Nothing will slip by you. Nothing."
1,Poor quility make this a poor bag,"These lawn bags are very, very ,very ,very, very (did I mention VERY) thin. I filled the bag half as full as I would fill a normal lawn bag and it split down the seems. I took my second one and filled about a quarter of the way full and when I was trying to tie this it split down the seem. Guess they figure these are good enough just to be orange and have a face on them.I'll never buy them again"
2,Note: This is a single use (or less) bag.,"So I was hoping that for an expensive decorated trash bag, this would last at least a year or two. I'm sorry to say that this is no where near a kitchen trash bag strength, let alone a more robust bag (like a construction bag) for leaves/grass. I ordered two and for a single bag, this isn't inexpensive. Before I had the first one full, it had a tear. The second didn't tear, but I was being very gentle. I would hope for something a bit more robust for the price."
3,Used this for a inexpensive Pumpkin Costume,"I was looking for an inexpensive pumpkin costume. I knew that I wouldn't be using this costume again and didn't want to worry about ripping it or sitting on it. I found this bag and thought I'd give it a try. It worked just as I had hoped. I cut open the bottom of the bag, wore some black sweatpants. I stuffed the bottom of the bag (with the hole I cut in it) into my sweatpants. Filled the bag up with some crumpled paper. Cut a couple arm hols and sinched the top with some tape. You can find pumpkin hats anywhere - I found one at a Dollar store that had the pumpkin handle.As for durability as a leaf bag - i don't think that this would hold up. It did rip very easily and was very thin. Also only 1 bag is in the package. A good price for a costume but a little pricy for a garbage bag to fill with leaves. Maybe if it came with two."
3,Not What I Expected,"I have watched each episode of the Rebus TV series and was expecting something similar with this first read of a Rebus mystery. However, I was disappointed. The book was plodding and I only finished half of it."
3,Okay,"I read this book for the seventh grade and did a project on it. i couldn't imagine any of the characters that weren't on the covers of the book. i tried to search for pictures of the people but no one had even heard of them. the plot line was okay, but it didn't really keep me hooked."
5,A new peruvian tradition,"The Art of Peruvian Cuisine captures the best of Peru's culinary history. As a peruvian I can only say that each of the recipes truly recalls what I saw and experienced as a child when watching ( and tasting) the amazing combination of delicate flavors and textures unique to Ricardo Palma's land. This book is a must for all those interested in latinamerican cuisine, and for sure a new ""peruvian tradition""."
3,FAX BLAST UPDATE - returned this item,"I was just about to order this based on FAX BLAST's review, when I checked his other review, which states that he returned THIS ITEM because it seemed like a toy. Thought this update would give fuller picture."
3,Good item!,Excellent item! They are concerned to serve customers well. One of the extensions that came with the phone was defective and they immediately replace it! Excellent service. Recommendable equipment! This has been the solution from my workplace! You will not regret it.
2,2 stars,"This book is perhaps the most boring presentation of any topic I have ever come across. To illustrate without violating any copyrights please follow along as I change a light bulb:There are several kind of light bulbs; tungsten filaments, flourescent, neon, etc. A lightbulb changer determines the proper light bulb necessary. In the case of a tungsten filament bulb the old bulb is unscrewed and the new one is screwed in its place. The lamp can then be turned on and used for illumination.The book however can't.In addition they charge $7 extra for the answer key and then charge another $4+ for shipping of the answer key. Please note also that their site crashed during the order process so I didn't trust the publisher with my CC#."
1,Quality control problems,"As with most camera straps, the ends are doubled over and sewn together to prevent fraying. The only trouble is that with this strap the ends are too thick to fit through the lugs on my Canon 30D. I tried using a screw driver to push them through and needle-nose pliers to pull them through, but they are just too thick. The lugs on my 30D are pretty standard, so I'm guessing that my strap came from a bad batch. If I were more ambitious, I could cut the stitching, unfold the ends, push them through the camera lugs and sew them back up. But I'm not, so I'll just buy a different strap."
5,Very satisfied,"The description says it accurately: ""a simple, yet comfortable strap,"" and at a reasonable price. And it doesn't take up much room in my camera carrying case."
5,Easy and effective to use,"This is the exact same product that is used in the Sports Center that I go to for physical therapy, and is used to hold a coldpack in place on my shoulder. It is easy to use and nicely secures the coldpack. Since this is what the pros use, you can't go wrong buying it."
4,"An informative book, but not for the casual reader","This book is written not for the general reader, but for those already familiar with the relevant disciplines. As a result, while parts are enlightening (particularly the case studies and the translation of Asperger's original article), the book overall can be a slow and difficult read."
5,The classic text on Asperger's syndrome,The book which helped start the recent surge of research into high-functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome. Includes the first ever English translation of Dr. Asperger's original paper. A genuine classic.
4,Advanced Text,"This book is great for people who are already familiar with this syndrome and are seeking advanced knowledge. For this group the orginal article by Asperger himself should be enlightening. However, this is not a good book for teachers and parents who are just learning about Asperger's syndrome. For them I would recommend Asperger's Syndrome by Tony Attwood."
3,Dry read but reflective,This book is an extremely dry read (as you should expect). The insights are reflective of the time and yet it is very insightful and enlightening. I am very pleased with this book. It opened my eyes to my son's condition and allowed for better understanding. It is written by medical professional(s) so some medical terminology knowlege is helpful. It is very insightful to see issues that Asperger's patients had and how they dealt with it. Very helpful!
4,Great family movie,"When I went to WalMart, they were no longer carrying this movie. Thank you, Amazon, for having such a good selection of products to choose from. This is a delightful movie for kids and adults."
5,Great movie,"We love this movie. In fact, we lost the first DVD, so I had to buy another one. My boys (4 and 7) thought the pranks they played on the Nanny were hilarious. Emma Thompson does a fantastic job in this movie. The British accent is sometimes hard to understand the first time you watch it, but you pick up things you missed when you watch it again, and again, and again. Enjoy!"
4,Throughly Enjoyable,Emma Thompson leaves her period drama and becomes a magical nanny who charms you with her common sense and basic standards.
4,A Fun Family Movie,"We watched this movie for family night after having already seen the second Nanny Mcphee. It was enjoyable to watch for myself, husband, 9 and 10yr. old, and had good lessons for the kids. There was one scene that suggests inappropriate behavior that might not be suitable for all ages, but in context can easily be explained. Overall, it was a good film that our family enjoyed."
5,Nanny McPhee,"I had seen this movie in my local neighborhood theater and absolutely loved it. Somewhere I saw it billed/advertised as the new Mary Poppins,.I had to add this movie to my film library. It is hysterially funny. ""Nanny"" appears uninvited with a peculiar facial appearance which could be slightly frightening to small children.She has a cane that sends fireworks and ""sparklely"" lights when it smacks the floor to emphasize a point. Her purpose is to ""take"" unruly children and teach them 5 lessons (in her own inimitable fashion). As they learn each one, OOPSY-DAISY, I don't want to give away the fun. This movie is an absolute must see and I look forward to seeing the sequel."
5,One of the best,"I bought this CD off other amazon recommendations and immediately loved it. From the beginning to the end this CD is pleasure to the ears. One couldn't accurately call this band an Interpol cover band as they both started at virtually the same time. One could vaguely compare the sounds as both bands undoubtedly have the same influences. An interesting fact is that both bands are quite good friends, they probably wouldn't be if they were copying each others' sounds. A soundtrack for life. Listened to this CD while trying to get around Montreal on a snowy winter day and it was perfect. Listened to it working out in an NYC gym and again, perfect. Hard to say which song is ""the best"" on the CD, but ""Gender Bombs"" is radio single-quality, but there are still many others. It would be difficult for me to understand why anyone would be disappointed with this purchase. A must-have for the music collection. Dying to see these guys at a live show."
3,Never make it,"The Stills have a great melow rock thats really good background music to chores at home. Although a plus, I ended up loosing touch with the CD in my car. It doesn't have the driving beats I look for when cruising down the road. Hence the average of a 3 stars."
3,hella horn OK but paper sucks,"I bought the horns and they are pretty much as advertised, 2 horns and a relay. After you open the box you are on your own. No mention of wire size and the ""schematic"" leaves a lot to be desired. The accompanying paperwork to wire them up is poorly written and incomplete. When you call their US support to tell them that, they acknowledge that it is bad but that they can't get their own company to change the paper despite the complaints. If you are an electical wiz, this isn't a problem. For many, it will be a problem."
5,VERY GOOD,el sonido del pito es muy fuerte y duro ! bueno en el vehículo que lo tengo conectado posee un buen sistema eléctrico de 14. 8 volts
3,Damaged,"The yellow copy sheets throughout the whole book were damaged (a 4 inch wide, thick dark streak across the entire left side) so much so that anything I write on that side of the white sheets is not visible on the yellow sheets.Have only ordered one of these through Amazon, so perhaps it's an uncommon problem. The other reviewers were obviously pleased with the notebook they received, so if it costs more at your bookstore it still may be worth getting it from amazon (just allow enough time to return it if it's damaged)."
5,Fun car CD!,We bought this CD at a Wiggles concert a few months ago and accidentally left it in a car we traded in...hope the new owners are Wiggle fans! I quickly replaced it as my 5 year old absolutely loves this CD. A few of the songs are done in Spanish which is a nice change and is a great introduction to the language.
1,cool,i think this doll is cool but tori would be better.but she comes with a mic that you can use thats cool.
3,"cool looking, but not real durable","My son collects the Pyrates sets and now has them all. This one is just like the rest in that they do not stay together. Actually, this one is the worst of them all because we couldn't even get the mast to snap on correctly and stay on because of a defect in the piecing of the boat. The mast constantly pops out. These sets are cool to look at, but my son won't play with them because they are constantly falling apart. My husband has even talked of gluing them together. The pirate figures that come with the set are pretty neat and they are my son's favorite part of the set. The detail is incredible on all the pieces, which is one of the reasons we do like these sets. I grew up with Legos and prefer those over the Mega Bloks because they are much more durable and easier to build with, but they are not as detailed. These sets are more for show than play."
2,What's up with her body?,"My daughter picked this out, it was on sale, thank goodness, I think all she wanted was the mic, which she does play with alot, the doll however, has some issues, the legs are ilke those old bendy toys with no shape and her waist is permanently bent sideways, it bothers me no end, I am forever trying to set her up straight forgetting she doesn't. If it wasn't for the microphone this doll would have been a total bust."
1,NO!!!!!!I will give it 1 star.,This doll is not beautiful.The american Idol collection is the worst.Cali Girl is too.I don`t want to buy it.I am so sorry!!!!!
4,Cute,This book shelf was pretty easy to put together and a lot sturdier than I thought which is great because of the price. My son's story and coloring books were all over his room and now he looks likes he has his own little library. Very cute. I would recommend this to a friend.
1,Horrible smell!,This bookshelf smells terrible and we had to take it out of my son's room immediately. The smell is so bad that we put it outside for two weeks as recommended by some of the Amazon reviewers. It seemed that the smell was getting better so we left it in the laundry room for another two weeks to be sure but unfortunately it still smells. It looks very cute in the picture and looked amazing in my son's room so it seemed worth waiting it out but now I have missed the return window and am stuck with it.Normally I would have just quickly returned an item with this issue but I spent so much time trying to find just the right book shelf for my son that this is the biggest disappointment of any purchase I have made in years. My son is disappointed as well. I would not recommend it unless you want your child to inhale what I guess are paint/wood treatment fumes.
5,Love it!,This book shelf is absolutely adorable and not flimsy. It's not to big and not to small. It's perfect.
3,DO NOT USE AN ELECTRIC SCREW DRIVER,"I bought this product and matches well with the furniture in my sons room. However, most importantly DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES use a power tool of any kind to put this together. I used my handy electric screwdriver and split the wood immediately. Also do not over tighten. I will say that Kid Kraft responded with no hassles and sent me a new piece. They should fix the instructions. FYI I had already called them because one of panels was not the same color, they fixed it all."
5,complete overview of the power of God's Anointing,The book will revolutinze the readers concept on the anointing! Tim Bagwell has captured the essence of all that is inherent in the anointing power of God! I highly recommend this relevant and timely message to all those who desire truth. It lays down principles that are destined to imact your life and the world around you!!
4,one of the greatest singers ever,"i'm ashamed to admit, arthur alexander fiend that i am, i never knew he recorded for monument/sound stage 7. So, here come my old friends ace records uk to let me in on this stuff. I'm telling you, you gotta get one of these. The first four tracks were recorded in Nashville with many of the same cats who played on ""Blonde on Blonde,"" the next half dozen in LA with most of the Wrecking Crew, and many others under Reggie Young's direction, so needless to say, the production value is impressive and varied. The songs themselves, save a few odd covers, are some of Mr. Alexander's finest...the frenetic ""You Don't Love Me (You Don't Care)"" and ""I Really Need You"" are incredible recordings and easily two of his finest. In fact, there really are no bum tracks here, you can buy this with confidence...this is some of the best country soul you will ever hear. I just wish I'd heard it sooner!"
5,great reference,"This book was perfect for my husband. Everything was exactly as described, I received it quickly, and it was packaged very well. Very glad to make this purchase. Thank you."
2,It was too tight,"I was looking for carriers but, I couldn't find any that were ""cheap"" so, I got the cheapest one and it was very uncomfortable and my baby's a jumper and she likes to move alot so. I threw that one away and got this one, but, this was really tight on my and my baby but, she would keep still. I tried adjusting the straps but, nothing quite worked. I think I should just continue my hunt and maybe I'll just get an exspensive one, because this one just didn't fo it for me."
5,Excellent research resource,I was looking for some background about Colorado and someone suggested this book. It has some hidden parts of history that many other books don't contain. It will stay in my library for future use.
2,Go to a dentist instead,"Did this stuff for 3 weeks, every day for 20 minutes, on my top row of teeth so I could compare to the bottom. Had only 4 cups of coffe during this period, and nothing else staining such as red wine or tobacco. Can't see any difference at all. Think I did everything right. If I want to whiten, no more of these strips or gels or whatever, it's to the dentist I go."
3,Book was ok..,"The book starts out slow and then gets going. it is not a super duper book, i would rather read it if i had more time. written so that it is hard to understand, switches times without really letting you know, but the real details in the book were great.Sophie, 7th grade, 13"
3,THE HERO AND THE CROWN-ROBIN McKINLEY,"Aerin is the youngest princess in all of Damar. She is frowned upon when having fun and considered ugly. But when she tries to train her father's old horse, she sets off for an adventure. She has found an ointment that protects against burns. So she sets off to defeat the ""last"" dragon. But will she survive?An OK book. Definitely not the best. It seemed to go on for too long and was WAY too complicated. I recommend it though. But don't read it's prequel, ""The Blue Sword"", unless you gave this book five stars."
4,Almost as good as the Blue Sword,"This is a wonderful book that features a lady hero. It is well written, but doesn't have quite the flow of the Blue Sword. Still, it is a fabulous addition to a fantasy readers' collection. Would be especially good for young girls. It portrays that women can be many things, including strong and heroic. It can also be read out of chronology with the other book and will still make sense."
3,"It's a good book, but it's got it's low points...",This book is well written but not very intrusting. The plot is very good but you have to step back to see the whole pictur. Not a real page turner. It's complex. From a 14 year old.
2,This is not so great story,"This book is a routine fantasy story for me. Many avid readers of fantasy just loved and praised this book a lot but I don't think this book is worth for it. The people say this book has great descriptive expressions, but I think the author wrote too much useless information. This is one reason I didn't really like this book. The story is really normal and expectable. This book has about 360 pages, but in the first 100pages don't really have any interesting events at all. The out line of story is like this; there are Dragons, which harm people. One day, the king asked to his people to kill the dragons, but no one showed up. As you can expect, Aerin, the daughter of king, came forward to kill the dragons. As usual, she got help from a wizard, and killed the dragons one by one. I think this book don't really have a creative and unique story. This is another reason I didn't like this story. You might like this book, but I don't recommend you to read this book."
5,Book of strength and resilience,"This book is my favorite, of favorites, I have a copy that is worn to bits, reading after reading, I have read it once every year, for the past 8 years, this book transcends the idea of a tale, immerses the reader and makes them feel greatness."
5,This book was wonderful!,"This book was a wonderful, heartstopping book. It really makes a person feel like they are in the story. people who understand this book and have good sense of imagination, you will love this story. The author has a way of making you feel the character's emotions and about how the character feels about the others in the book. Read It!"
4,Fasten your seatbelts,"Moments of brilliant writing.Fantastic, strong heroine.No cliched love triangle.Beautiful warhorse sidekick.A badass army.The magical bits are left a bit vague. McKinley doesn't explain how things work exactly (i.e. the blood stone, the skull, the crown, the Gift, everything else). But I found myself, strangely, at peace with it.I see Aerin as a basis for the popular female protagonists today. But McKinley isn't all up in her grill like many contemporary writers. Aerin isn't moody or whiny or annoying. The fact that she's a woman doesn't actually matter much in this world."
5,stunning plot and characters,"I first had this book read to me when I was in fifth grade, and it was incredibly confusing. I picked it up again in high school and understood why. McKinley uses time like Faulker - it becomes one of the very elements she writes with, like structure or diction. Chronology is fluid, and it works amazingly well throughout the story. The interplay of memory and action, past and present and future is amazing. The character development is also stunning. Aerin, the main character, is strong, with significant depth. Through her interactions with the others, we can see not only how she relates to them, but who they are - and they are not just the stock personalities we tend to find in a ""fairy tale."" All in all, incredible writing, one of my favorite books, and something well worth a read. Not your typical fantasy book - something much more, something ambitious that sparks your literary palate."
5,Verdaderamente sólo grandes éxitos,Este CD comprende básicamente los mejores éxitos de Lolita y es sin duda un disco que no puede faltar en la colección de los fans de Lolita. Hermosas canciones con una excelente orquestación y una interpretación destacada. Una compra obligada.
1,"Ibn Warraq keeps trying, but fails miserably","I was glad to see that Ibn Warraq realizes that his words lack any serious weight in the intellectual community and brought in other scholars to do his work for him in this text. But in the end, it's just a rehash of the same arguments that have made their rounds several times, and have been proven incorrect time and again.Nothing here except nice binding."
4,Mostly Good,"The good news is that Steve Howe still has a great sense of song-writing. This CD is very original, even if it does allude to other pieces from Yes and Asia in a couple of tracks. It is not too experimental, nor is it too conventional; it is a nice mix. Now for the bad news: It does suffer from being a little too unpolished and amateurish. I agree with another reviewer that this may be a result of his sons playing on most of the albums tracks. Certainly the blame cannot be placed on Tony Levin (whose contribution is not as bold as I would have liked, but solid nonetheless) or Steve. I would not say, however, that the music is emotionless. It is anything but that. It's just unpolished in places, but this isn't even bad enough to bypass the CD. It is worth listening to, and a good listener will be rewarded."
5,Timex - Ironman Watch,This is my 3rd Ironman watch. I have had great experiences with these watches. They are easy to see and I like the ability to have 5 different alarms on my watch. This watch can take a beating and keep on ticking.
1,didn't work,"I received it with a dead battery. After replacing the battery, none of the buttons worked except the indiglo button."
5,Timex Flix Ironman,"this is my second watch like this. It replaces another Timex Ironman that still keeps perfect time after almost a year. The mode button failed however and I'm getting ready to change to EST from daylight Savings Time. The disappointing thing about these watches is that after one replaces the batteries, they don't stay waterproof. I've come to think of them as disposable watches, that do last 4-5 years, usually.They have generally been fine watches for what they are."
2,Strap is poor quality,"The watch arrived quickly and in excellent condition however having used the product for a while now, I can honestly say I'm not happy with it.The band is very loose. I frequently have the strap slipping off and hanging out in the air where it catches on clothing paper etc. In theory the latch on the band should stop it from doing that but it doesn't really hold down the loose strap well.I'm definitely suffering from buyers remorse. At this point, any old $20 watch at Walmart would be an improvement."
2,I use it for lap swimming.,"In the pool , every time I reach the wall I press the middle button, so the lap is counted.I have learned that often even when pushing it it does not register the lap.Only when it beeps it counts."
3,A button away from being great,Great look and feel. The only problem is the lower center button called the Start/Split button. It gets hit accidentally all the time. If not for this inconvenience this would be a great watch.
1,Didn't Last 6 Months,"We purchased this watch for a Christmas gift for our grandson. His mother told us today, under 6 months later that it quit and a new battery wouldn't fix it. Amazon wouldn't let us return it after January, so we're stuck for $37.00. We're very disappointed with the product and Amazon's limited return policy!"
