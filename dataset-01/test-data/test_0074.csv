1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I just opened this item (I did not purchase it from Amazon) and turned it on with the good intention of making cookies. I put the beaters in and plugged it in and was quite anxious to start it. When I turned it on, the beaters were not moving. The mixer started smoking. My boyfriend is a mechanic and took it apart and found that inspector #8 (according to the sticker on the bottom) left a washer jammed in the motor. He removed the washer and put it back together and the machine started - this time it was smoking and sparking. It's now been thrown on the patio and I've no intention of bringing it back in the house. I have a $5 mixer that needed a new set of beaters and the beaters from the new mixer fit it. I'm real happy that I didn't throw out my old mixer before I tried the new one! Please don't waste your money - you will be disappointed."
1,Not a quality product,I bought this last Christmas for my husband and it is not worth it. The clip on light was the first thing to break. Then the plastic connectors that are used to attach the light to the shower head broke when I tried to take the mirror down. Now it's completley useless. That was too much money wasted for what little time it was used.
5,Sleep mask,I have tried many sleep masks over the years and have found this to be the best so far. It is comfortable and does a good job of keeping out most of the light. A tiny bit filters through across the bottom but with my eyes closed it is not a problem .If I tightened it more it might seal completely but not be as comfortable. Some that I have tried in the past had such heavy foam construction that they were not comfortable at all and they were impossible to use when I tried to sleep on my side. This mask stays in place well even when I am on my side. It does not press on my eyes so it does not seem to interfere with eye movements during REM sleep. (I did not use the ear plugs as I just don't like wearing any earplugs.)
1,Don't waste your money,"These are by far the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. They are stiff as a board and have no flexibility when you walk. They look cute on, but are unbearable to wear."
4,"A darned good read, much to my surprise!","I don't normally ""go for"" Western romances - they all seem to have the same plot - but this one got me in. The writing is good and well-paced, the characters are engaging. One can't help feeling for the brother even though he deserves the worst punishment. The heroine is not too silly and hero is HOT! His angst is believable and the ending - although a little abrupt - was satisfactory (of course!)Usually I fall by the wayside in romantic Westerns, but this time I was fully engaged throughout. I even felt sorry for the Deputy Marshall!Not strictly a keeper, but I did enjoy it and the cover was extremely enticing LOL"
4,Great Characters/Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book. The characters are three dimensional and interesting people. The secondary characters are fully developed interesting people also. The author did an excellent job with building up [intimate moments] throughout the book. The first [intimate moment] happens towards the beginning of the book, which usually means the rest of the book will be boring. Not so in After The Ashes. The [intimate moments are]hot and exciting throughout the book. This is a wonderful debut for the author. I highly recommend this for lovers of western romance."
5,Backyardigains Pablo,Should say in Ad that it needs it's own software and player. I didn't so I am stuck with it.
5,SOOOO hot,This case is so hot The color is fantastic and totally girly. I had no problems with peeling or losing crystals. Very pleased!!
3,12 yr. old reader,"i loved this book. it was kinda funny(me). i think r.l. stine could have done better. you would have to ask the same questions as in the first one ""Does Bill live."" ""What happens to the murderer."" i am so hoping for a best friend three. so i know what happens. i am a big fan but he could of done better. i reccomend this book to anyone who has the best friend 1 just to know what happened but you will be disappointed."
1,Stop it! It hurts!,"All I can say is, ""ouch."" If anyone came along today and tried to put out such a mess of a CD they'd be laughed at. What happened to Ms. Minnelli's voice? It used to shine with a crystal energy that was unequaled. Too much smoking has obviously ruined it. The mannerisms are more than distracting. Some call it emotion, but it comes across as egotistical neediness in the worst affected way."
1,"Great looking, but cheaply made","This timer is great looking, and I loved that it has a magnetic back so I could keep it on the refrigerator. Unfortunately, I had had it only a few weeks when it fell on the floor and the top piece separated from the bottom. I know most things can't survive being dropped all of the time, but I sort of expect something that is meant to be kept vertically on the refrigerator to be able to stand up to at least one fall.The worst thing is that there aren't a lot of magnetic kitchen timers out there, let alone good looking ones, so it is even more tragic that this one doesn't meet expectations."
2,Unsatisfying and verbose; would have been better as a short story,"This story is told with too much tangential information and musings, to the point where I was jealous half way through the book in which the protagonist tells another person everything that had happened thus far in ""less than 30 minutes"" - why couldn't he have given the poor reader the same treatment?A more concise telling may have made the book entertaining, but there would still be problems with unsatisfying actions taken by the characters, as well as the unsatisfying ending."
4,Suspend your preconcieved ideas on how prosperity works,"This book is simple in words, although the language is formal and sometimes a bit stilted, the message is loud and clear...prosperity, joy, abundance is our birthright. As an self-proclaimed spiritual seeker I found that this book is in line with other spiritual texts, that limitations, lack and scarcity, are created not outside of us but by our own self imposed restrictions and acceptence on what other people say we should have and what we cannot have. We are our own severest critic. We live in a world where rationality and logic are worshipped. If it does not have a scientific explanation...it's not real. Do yourself a favor, suspend this judgement and you will get the message of this book. The rest is up to you."
3,some bad songs bring this one down,"colplay five starsmissy four starsavril three starsalicia a surprisingly dissapointing three stars for a boring performancemichelle four starsnappy roots, annoying but alright two starsjewel four starsroots, my favorite surprise on this disc, i have to pick up their discs now FIVE STARSlil kim four starsnew found glory one star cuz i can't give 0vanessa- we'll see a lot from her i think four starslisa marie- shouldn't sing but still kinda interesting two starswayne wonder- wonder why? one starDevin Mcgraw- Annoying voice good song three stars."
4,beautiful cookware,"well balanced, nicely designed, easy to maintain, good assortment in the set, the only negative is that the handles get hot. I would buy again in a heartbeat!"
4,A subject that needs to be explored,"Katheryn Burns has written a great book. Her discussion of the spiritual economy is innovative and needs to be explored by more people. Burns uncovers a history that has been neglected by most historians but is integral to one's understanding of colonial Latin America. In short, this is must read for anyone interested in the subject."
3,a bit repetitive,"I think the soundtrack captures the spirit of the film. However, the inclusion of the main theme in nearly every song is repetitive. It would also have been nice if the soundtrack had included the song that Elizabeth sings at Darcy's. If you are looking for a great Austen film adaptation soundtrack, check out Sense and Sensibility."
4,Heart Soaring...,"I am rarely attune to scores but after reading the book and seeing the movie first hand, I was just thoroughly awed by everything in this production including the music. I ordered the CD Soundtrack here in Amazon and was ecstatic to finally received it. I played it over and over again... It's heart soaring, made me feel free. I agree with the reviewer from Simi Valley that Carl Davis' had indeed made the scores fun, moving and deep with emotions.The reason why I didn't rate this CD a 5 stars 'cuz there was quite a few of the musics played in the movie that was not in this soundtrack. I was looking forward in hearing couple of my favorite scores in the movie, which sadly wasn't included here. Unfortunately, I also don't know the names of that two music I so longed to hear. One was played in Piano by one of Mr. Bingley's sisters. Oh well, overall, this CD is simply dreamy. I listen to it often especially when I am reading my Historical Romance Novels. What a GREAT combination!"
4,Great radio at bargain price,This is a small compact digital radio that is easy to use. I have purchased several of these from the local Walgreens as I lose them or simply break them. The one problem as mentioned in other reviews is the tendency for the radio to go on or off when put into a bag. I really dont understand why they dont fix this. You will probably want a higher quality earphone also but the enclosed phones are ok. For the price and ease of use you cant beat this.
2,Not impressed,"I picked up this unit 'cause it seemed most highlyregarded in its class here on Amazon. The thing isnot a very impressive little toy, IMHO.I keep it on MONO all the time in order to cut downon static from bad reception. Even the most powerfulstations (e.g. KQED in the SF bay area) are regularlyinterrupted by static.The reception is simply poor. Everything else aboutit seems okay- I even think the sound is pretty goodwhen it comes in (and I can be picky about that).Since I use this for walking the dog, I expect it tocome to an unfortunate early demise. At that time Iplan to try something else."
1,Buyer Beware!,"The main reason I bought this cd was for the hit ""You never done it like that."" It turns out that the version on this cd is a re-recorded version that sounds very boring compared to the original version. I got so irritated with this fact that I ended up selling the cd to a used cd store. As far as the rest of the cd, I can't really say much about it. I was too disappointed to listen to the rest of it."
3,The best book,I liked this book.I liked it because it was funny.It was funny when Sharon made a super-duper frog face.Other kids should read it because it is a good book.I think Freckle Juice is a good book.
4,Fake Freckle Juice Recipe was Funny,"We liked this book because it was funny. These are the funny parts; when Andrew drew the freckles on his face, Sharon's frog face and the ending was the best when Sharon had a new recipe.One boy (and the teacher) actually tried the secret recipe but we didn't get any freckles!"
5,The best book ever!,I like the book because Andrew got the recpie and made it because after he drank it he didn't have freckles. Then he put some magic marker that was bue on his face. Why did he do that instead of brwn magic marker? I just love the book I read.
4,I Need Freckles,"I Need FrecklesWhen I saw this book I didn't think I would under stand it but , after I read it I thought it was interesting . Will the secret recipe work? After Andrew made the secret recipe he plugs his nose, tilted his head back, then he drank it. It did not seam to work. The next day he went to school he tock a marker and made dots on his face for freckles. My favorite part of Freckle Juice is when Sharon passed the secret recipe to Andrew. I liked this part because Sharon was trying to be sneaky and she was very funny. I think the author's purpose of Freckle juice is you should like what you look like not just what others look like. I think other kids would like to read this book because it is a funny and enjoyable book!by: Maci"
4,I picked this over the titanium model.,"Titanium might have been lighter, but I was concerned about the heat transfer so I chose the aluminum set. Worked great, only downside is that the skillet handle colapsed spilling my omelette on the ground!"
3,Missing Items,"I got the Snow peak Trek 1400 cookset today, opened the packaging the cookset is there great, but the mesh sack that keeps set together is missing. Bought it because I often backpack and need a lightweight cookset that packs within itself, very clean and neat. The mesh sack is important part of the set, I'm not too happy that its missing."
3,Not entirely what I expected.,"I received the dog bone cookie cutter quickly. Unfortunately, it was quite smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe only and inch and a half long...disappointed but it will do the job. A bit overpriced for such a small item I think."
1,Not erotic or entertaining,"For fans of true '70's Euro-erotic classics such as The Story of O and Emmanuelle, this film does not deliver any quality erotic scenes. First, the women in the film are mostly unatractive and frumpy looking. The violent S&M scenes are less creative than some Showtime films these days. The lack of ""eroticism"" is evident from the first five minutes and remains so, throughout the film. It is a shame a poorly produced sexplotation film, such as this one made it onto DVD format, while a first class film such as ""The Story of O"" has not!"
1,WARNING: KOREAN VERSION GROSSLY CUT,"I bought this Korean version of the classic exploitation film I saw back in the 80's and I was disappointed about the editing. To put if clearly, all the below the belt nude scenes were almost all cut except for a few needed for movie continuity. If you are going to buy this film: Buy American. This Korean version claims, ""complete and uncut."" It wasn't"
3,Steamy shower scenes with interludes of violence,"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS could not be taken seriously; the acting was over the top and it was done on a cheap budget. It is fun to watch if you didn't take it seriously. I wasn't really prepared for the very hard edged nature of this DVD. I have seen the other Ilsa videos, but clearly The Wicked Warden is very hard edged and with little humor. There are plenty of shower scenes and fighting in the shower with wrestling on the floor which may amuse viewers. But between that are scenes of torture and brutality which may put off some; I felt it was more cruel than it needed to be. In a short, this DVD was not a lot of fun to watch although the DVD was a spotless print and there was plenty of frontal nudity. Viewer be cautioned."
1,EDITED VERSION!,"This DVD looks great, the image is sharp. The colors are good.The film has been EDITED though. All ""full frontal"", as Mr. Skin would say, scenes are edited out.It looks like other scenes have been cropped to avoid the pubic region. I'm wondering if this print may have come from Japan where they blur the lower region even in adult films.It's too bad the film has been cut because the image looks great.And the credits have also been edited out, replaced by the Cheexy Flicks logo!"
1,What was I thnking,This collection is nothing short than a TOTAL waste of money. Don't even bother to rent any of them. They are 100% cheap sexploitative and not even done well at that. Avoid avoid avoid!
4,Loved this book when I was 12 (1967).,"I read this book when I was 12 or so (1967) and really enjoyed it. I am anxious to read it as an adult and see if it is as good as I remember. Back then, I recall that it made me really want to go to the Maryland's Chesapeake Bay. Haven't made it yet, but still want to go."
5,Favorite Album EVER!!!,"This album is FANTASTIC!!! I had a copy of it in the 90's and then lost it over the years, and I recently found it again here on Amazon - AWESOME!!! Beware - this is different from either of the Broadway versions available, and it's MUCH better. Just make sure you verify with the seller that it's the same as the cover you see here, because I recently bought it but received the Broadway version. (I LOVE Terrence Mann in the Broadway version, but the woman who plays the lead is terrible in the Broadway album, and, of course, no one can hold a candle to Linder Eder!)"
3,Who Wants to be a Millionaire Kids Edition,The CD is good but you need to be careful when installing it. Your screen settings need to be changed to 800X400 res. or it will not run on vista or certian operating systems.
1,Not for Sensitive Children,"My 8 year old son was so looking forward to this game, and likes to play it because he likes answering the questions to see how high he can get, but he's wound up in tears over the nasty comments made by Regis (paraphrase - ""It's OBVIOUS the correct answer is 'c' - DUH!""), and is frustrated when tricks not found on the show like the phone a friend person not being home fouls up the game. Perhaps older children or ones that are less sensitive may find this funny, but if your child is sensitive at all or you are trying to teach your child good sportsmanship, I would definitely not recommend this game."
2,"Great idea, needs better construction","My kids (and I) loved, loved, loved this product for two days. It was fairly safe, though did tip over if they were both on one side (together they were well under the weight limit). However, the product came apart along a seam and the air came out after using it only under the manufacturers guidelines."
2,Monroe,I bought this strut for my 98 Ranger and it is the wrong part. I live in Belize and it will cost me too much to return it.
3,"Beautiful pictures, infantile text.","Let me start out by saying I am an Imus fan and have been listening to his program since the 70's. That being said this book was a mild disappointment. The beautiful pictures of the American Southwest are definitely worth the price of admission. But the comments often get in the way. How many times does the phrase ""fat tourists"" need to be said in order to make a point?(At least three in this book along with other derogatory mentions.)The text seems to be an afterthought and probably could have been omitted all together. But the picture on page 12 alone makes the rest of it worthwhile."
2,"Great Photography, But.......","As promised, this book has wonderful photography. It really shows off a lot of the beauty we have in this country. However, the language used throughout the book is disgusting. I have not decided whether I will cross out the words with a black marker or discard the book. I certainly would not want a visitor to pick up the book in my home and think I could possibly condone such language. I'm assuming this is the reason the book was offered at such a fantastic price."
5,Great Toddler toy!,I bought this for my grandson who's 11 months old for a Christmas present. He absolutely loves it and is really fascinated with the lights that flash on the front. Its a sturdy riding toy that teaches him how to get around on his own by pushing with his legs. He has alot of fun with it.
2,Boring Top 40 hits from a gifted musician,"Dan Fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer. Unfortunately, the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts, songs that seem formulaic and ""safe."" His best songs are the lesser known works -- listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them. They'll never make it to the pop airwaves. Serious Fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd. ""Greatest hits"" is not synonymous with ""greatest music."""
1,music lover from Texas,"It is very understandable when a great performer tries to compose music, after all he is talented, right? Well, of course. Many performers try , very few succeed... This CD is one example of a sincere touching effort of a virtuoso violinist Nigel Kennedy at composing his own music. The result is, alas, very disappointing. His extraordinary sensibility and taste as a performer is completely absent from his compositions.Maybe another time?"
2,Easy to Use,Overall the item works well. If keeping track of one player it is just fine. When trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player. To play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two.
2,Great value but.....,"I bought this deodorant having seen all the great reviews. It was also a great value for cost per ounce. The smell is unique that is for sure. I can see why some people would love it. The problem I have is that it does not last. By lunch time I am smelling pretty ripe. Another problem with that musk smell is that it is not a perfumy smell so it does not cover up BO all that well. If anything it only enhances the BO. If you dont have problems with BO or perspiration then I can see this working for you. Otherwise, avoid."
5,thsi stuf f is so fgood i he i eat it,i eat the deodorantits like a pushpopremember thosethey tell me it makes me smell like a schizo but that's probably confirmation bias because 'they' already know me here at the halfway home
4,Mennen regular deodorant,This Mennen product has no aluminium and is almost impossible to get in Australia. I get a rash from continued use of aluminium.
4,Good Stuff,I have been using Speed Stick for years. I stink soo much less when I use it.Give it a try.
5,Best bang for the buck,"I've never owned a self propelled mower before. What a difference. This mower is effortless to operate. So easy to use that I didnt even need to read the directions. Right out of the box, it started on the first pull. I've used it for three mowings so far(6000 sq ft property) and its operating flawlessly. Very good build quality and the engine is top notch. There are plenty of mowers that cost more but I cant imagine what makes them better performers."
1,Quality is just not there!,"I purchased this mower in july of 2005, and have had nothing but trouble with it. It has stopped running two times and the handle has fallen off two other times. This is my third Lawn Boy. I had good luck with the first two, but nothing but trouble with this one. I don't think the quality is there. I am moving on to another brand."
1,Doesnt work with the iHome cube,"This product was advertised as being compatible with the ihome cube which i bought not too long ago. These remote controls ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE IHOME CUBE. I cannot give an honest review of this product as it did not work with the latter. If it had i would have loved to have a remote control for the cube. The seller refunded my money, although i wish they had refunded my postage too, but o well. Not much to say really, this product does not work with the ihome cube....Gave it one star so i could publish this review otherwise i would not have been able to publish this."
2,Will NOT work with iHome iH15 LED color-changing speakers,"With we purchased the iHome iH15 LED Color-Changing speaker system, the Amazon web site said people also bought the IHOME IHR5 remote control, which indicated that they worked together. The speaker system DOES NOT have a remote function. Amazon even exchanged the remote when we told them it did not work, instead of letting us know that the remote would not work with the speaker system."
2,How to Change the Battery,"I bought this on ebay. Said it had been used but didn't really look like it. When I got it i tried it out and it wouldn't work. I'm thinking its the battery but how to change it? Is it the little compartment on the bottom? If so, it won't open."
1,Terrible Product,Do not buy this remote! We puurchased off of Amazon to use in conjunction with an iHome docking station we had and it doesn't work. The remote is so flimsy that it broke while trying to remove the battery cover to see if it was missing the battery. We can't return it now because it fell apart trying to determine if it came with a battery. Very flimsy product and doesn't work as a remote. Very disappointed. Did I mention what a piece of crap it is?
5,A must read for anyone coping with the loss of a loved one.,Gregory Floyd has unveiled the deepest emotions both he and Maureen continue to experience as a result of the loss of their son John Paul. After reading this book I have a renewed zeal to live life more fully as a Dad with my children. Gregory reminds us that our children are in fact not our children but God's. This book is a must read for anyone - especially for those having difficulty coping with the loss of a loved one. Gregory's story offers hope. Gregory didn't write this book...Gregory said yes to God to be the vessel for these words. I fell more in love with God as a result of reading this book. I also learned what a privilege it is to be a Dad and that our children our God's children....simply on loan to us; destined for eternity with God the Father in Heaven.
5,nostalgic novelty toy,"This is fun for the whole family and for anyone who comes by and wants to give it a try. The quality is good, except for the little felt stickies in the holes which are coming up at the edges (easily fixable). I don't remember what sort of box it came in, but I'm guessing not that great of one because we didn't keep it. A nice box would help with the storage aspect; as it is, it has just been sitting out here and there--a little conversation piece."
2,Too Easy!!,"Not like my friend's which is nearly impossible to win...just like they used to be. This is so easy my 6 year old grandson walked in, did it, and won on his first try. I want to buy the original, but not sure which brand that is."
5,Hey Doc,"Though I have not read the book, I know the author, Dr. Mallow, and I can say without a doubt that he knows his stuff. I'm sure its as good as they come on the subject. Doc, if you're reading this, I just wanted to say ""hey""."
2,Made my cats fat,"I fed this for 7 years. My cats loved the taste, but were all getting obese. It didn't dawn on me that it could be this premium food that was causing them to be so fat until I looked at a chart which compared ingredients of dry cat foods. Science Diet has nearly double the fat of most brands. I know carbs are a concern too when picking a diet for these little carnivores, but I switched (3 mos ago)to an Iams product that has meat as the primary ingredient, and less than half the fat. Another note is that the ""light"" cat food formulations, including Hill's, replace fat with grains. That's simply not acceptable and can lead to obesity just as surely.The jury is still out on my cats' battle of the bulge, but it does appear that they're a bit more svelte in just this short time."
1,Do not feed your cat this,"if you think you are a good cat parent please do your own research before buying this product. this cat food contains nothing but meat-by-products and grains! this stuff will kill your cat in the long run. if you are still feeding your cat this, stop immediately and google the ingredients of science diet cat food now and see for yourself."
1,not for your car,"The music is lively and great, but I could not play this CD in my car. I tried two other CD's, one burned and one other regular CD, and they both played! This CD did however play on my home boombox. Sad! The Borders store does give refunds on opened CD's either. They will only exchange it for the same CD, with a receipt! The manager told me to burn the CD and try to play the burned version. You would think the original is better than a burned version. Anyways, if you have a CD burner, you should be very happy with the CD in your car."
5,Adventures in Cooking,Excellent book on simple cooking from around the world. This book focuses on what people in poorer regions eat on a regular basis and how it is prepared. About 150 recipes. Where else will you find a cook book with a burlap cover?
5,the best food i ever tasted,hi its me again my mom purches this book when it first came out. she knows how to cook and cooks diner every nite. she love to wach paula deen on the food channel one day on a saturday she saw this realy good thing that she saw there the next day she made it for us and it tasted soooooooooo good and another time she made a choclate chip pie it was so good too I recomed this toy for every parent who likes too cook and there kids like there food.
2,Where are the pictures??????,"I love Paula Dean's show on the Food Network, but her cookbook fell a little short of my expectations. I prefer a cookbook where I can see a PICTURE of the prepared food, as well as pictures of ""helpful hints"" and ""how tos"".I will make a few of the dishes, but for the most part I'm sure this cookbook will sit on the counter unused."
3,Pretty Good,There are some good recipes but I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have too many pictures. I LOVE PICTURES in my cookbooks and this only had but 3-4 pages of pictures and that was it. Most of the recipes weren't even Paula's they were from her friends which I was also a bit disappointed but some of the recipes I have tried have been good- they need alot of ingrediants that I did not have so I had to go buy them but other then that they were good recipes. Not the usual Paula Dean style- but good. I recommend her other cookbooks but this was OK!
4,Great Recipes,"My husband and I love this cookbook! It offers easy and delicious recipes, as well as great menu ideas. Our friends and family love when we cook for them. Thanks Paula for the tasty recipes!"
5,I gave the deodorant to my husband to ...,I gave the deodorant to my husband to try. He's always looking for a better deodorant. He loves it. He likes the way it goes on dry and the lack of perfumes to mask body odor. This is definitely his favorite deodorant. He'd absolutely recommend it to anyone who'd listen.
5,A must for anyone who apreciates Ragtime,"Anyone who apreciates the Ragtime music of Scott Joplin should own a copy of the New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble. I grew up listening to an old cassette recording of the Ensemble and was so excited to find that a CD was still available. It is wonderful and exciting to hear Ragtime played by an entire enseble of instuments, rather than just a piano. Once again, a must for any lover of Ragtime."
4,EE 101,I like the book. I have about 20 years experience as an EE and welcome this book. It is not a book which grounds you in EE but a basic refresher with some good practical advice.
4,a great 'starter' book,I coach cricket in the US having played it in the UK. This book is a great introduction to the sport. I also coach rugby & I have found that one has to expect to buy several books/DVD et cetera to ensure that one has an overall view of ideas and tactics .
1,Contains useless information and boring,"I have read this book and I found the information contained within it to be so useless that it was actually quite boring to read with nothing new or informative to learn. I believe I would have better spent my money on other cricket coaching books which are much cheaper and in my view contain quality information regarding the coaching of cricket for all ages, youths included. I guess I forgot the golden rule ""never judge a book by its cover""."
4,"Not perfect, but still really good!","I've been a Koontz fan since I was a teenager, and this has been one of my standing favorites without fail. It's not as good as some of Koontz's later books (Midnight and Intensity are my absolute favorites), but it's still extremely entertaining, twisted, dark, weird, and suspenseful. As many others have pointed out, there is a LOT of gratuitous and unnecessary descriptions and dialogue, and the characters are very one-dimensional (the villain seems to be the only multi-faceted personality in the whole story). There's way too much talking overall. Basically, if you see a big paragraph, chances are you can skip right over it and you won't lose any of the story. Still, it's gritty, wicked fun to read."
4,A JOURNEY INTO THE DARK SIDE OF HUMAN MIND,"Fasten your seat-belt and get ready for a journey into the dark side of human mind. The most terrifying evil is hided into the human mind: this is the lait-motif of this book. And this is absolutely true. I think that in this book there are no guilties but only victims, Bruno Frye included. Hilary, Bruno, Katherine are all victims of someone who ""destroyed"" their minds. I liked this book but I don't agree with readers who consider this novel Koontz's best work. No compares, for example, with Strangers or Dark river of the heart. Anyway, if you start reading it, you'll go straight to the end."
1,disappointing,"Far-fetched & contrived character treatment. Nausiating detail for love scenes. I've read a lot of Koontz books & he's one of my favorite authors, but I had a hard time finishing this one."
4,I loved this book,"I read this book over 12 years ago, and have re-read it a couple times since. I love Dean Koontz and have read all of his books, I find him a great author and his books invoke the fear that they are supposed too. This one was one of my favorites."
4,HORRIFYING!,"I'm not good at telling what books are about, so read the other reviewers, they do it well.What I *will* say, is that this book has some horrifying characters in it! There's also a pretty chilling mystery going on about a dead guy coming back to life... or.... *does* he?This is a 501 page book and I got a little tired reading it. I think it could have been edited down so it wouldn't have gotten a little ""draggy"". It's well worth reading, though.I read the last pages of Whispers one night in bed > BIG MISTAKE! It has an ending that is very hard to shake off!...or should I say *sleep* off!You won't believe what the WHISPERS are saying!"
5,Best Book Ever!!,"I have read a few other Dean Koontz this was my first, but none of them were like the first. the other books were very awesome i must say, but this one was the best. I have never read such a book that captures all my intrests in a big. Its intense, suspenseful,romantic in some ways, and horror in others. The book was just plain out simple great!Anyone who likes a good book would enjoy this. The book is beyond good."
2,A Disappointment,"I would give the majority of this keyboard 5 stars for smoothness of keys and the USB port. However, the spacebar is inexcusable. It wobbles and clicks loudly when pressed. It sticks and often will not depress while typing. For fast typers, this is is extremely aggravating. I have taken the spacebar apart several times to try to repair the little wire support to no avail. As soon as I can take this piece of junk back to the store the better. I don't understand why it is so hard to find a decent keyboard these days. Is it because most are made in China? I loved this keyboard until after using nit for two days the spacebar began its thing. A keyboard is pretty much useless without a proper functioning spacebar. Hopefully Matias can work on this defect and avoid customer returns."
3,The best but no longer made,"The best deodorant I ever used. However they quit making it. Was able to find this one stick from this seller. Paid 4 times the original price, but what do you do when your favorite items are no longer available??? You pay for them..."
1,of little use,"The book is perhaps of historical interest and contains some adequate illustrations that may help you recoginize some genera. It is, however, fairly useless for identification to the species level."
3,"good for the price, but I would have liked better pictures of the seeds","I purchased this book for the seed pictures, but there are only line drawings. For general information, it is OK."
3,A little disappointing..,"If you really want to cook authentic, one-on-one Indian food, go for this book, but if you want to experiment or just get ideas, I wouldn't recommend this one. It's a little user-unfriendly (hardly any illustration) and provides lots of background and detail information. I find it hard to improvise or extract different ideas from these receipies; of course that depends on where you live (i.e. whether all the ingredients are available) Here they aren't so I can't really use the book!"
5,Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking,"As the title implies, this book is a classic. The recipes are clear, concise and yield successful results every time. We particularly enjoyed the Hot Tomato Chutney and the Garlic-Braised Eggplant.As in all her cookbooks, Miss Sahni's elegant style is always apparent. We expect great results and she delivers! Her books should be considered the definitive works on the subject of Indian cuisine.Thanks again, Julie, for another great experience. We eagerly await your next brainchild."
3,"A good book, sort of","This was a very good book, until I got to the last few pages. There, I found out that the famous 62nd and 70th homers were NOT included or reported about. Obviously, there wasn't much research done because the whole book was full of quotes moving the story along. I'd say that no more than 1/3 of the whole book was actual writing done by Rains himself. But, this was still a fairly good book. The pictures in the centerfold could have been a little bit better and more updated as well. But, the writing is what's important, right?"
2,This book is very simplistic.,"Anyone can get most of the information in this book on the internet. I found nothing new, and the style of writing was plain boring. I was hoping for more in depth research and more on Mark, the man. I was disappointed in this effort."
3,Fun for small ones,This was got for my 11 month old grandson. He enjoyed playing in it but some times will slide out. It was about a month after playing in that a hole was in it.
4,Innaccurate Age,"I bought this for my 12 month old twins for their birthday and thought they could get some good play time with it since the age shown online says 9 months to 18 years by amazon and 17 months to 3 years from the manufacturer. When I received it in the mail, to my surprise, IT SAID 18 MONTHS AND UNDER!!!!! My kids really enjoy it since I bought balls for it but ohterwise they would be too old to enjoy it."
2,Not durable at ALL!!!!!!!!!!!,"We bought this for our 7 months old and she did not like it at all. There was really nothing to amuse her. We had placed some toy's in it, but that still did nothing for her.If you are looking for somewhere to place your child and listen to them scream of boredom ... then here are your two stars. As far as bouncing, this was not a good idea. There was really no support to the walls of this item. Bouncing for a 18-20 pounder was not a good idea. The bouncer never sat straight, it always had a tilt to it. Maybe from the packaging. Also,the toy's hung wrong overhead as well. We are now 4 months later (of not that much use) throwing it out!!! Somewhere, it has sprung a leak and we cannot seem to find it either. So, overall ... this was not one of our better choices."
5,1st Lessons in Beekeeping Book,"This book provides great information on getting started with beekeeping. It was recommended to my hubby, by a friend of his."
3,First lessons in stateside beekeeping,"I found the book to be a good start for an absolute beginner like me. However, I live in the Caribbean, and the book is geared more to beekeeping in the US. I completely skipped the chapters on wintering and post-wintering your bees. We also have completely different flora."
4,Better than Pimsleur for conversations with the locals and friends,"I started with Pimsleur which moved at a slower pace and taught basic tourist Spanish (very formal). I'm trying to learn during my 30 minute commute to work. LSLC move quicker (I listen to each lesson several times) but teaches very usable things and will help you have an actual conversation. My only complaint is that some of the female speakers are hard to understand, even with repetition and turning up the volume. The male speakers are much clearer, but overall, I like the program."
1,"Book is great, CD-ROM is a joke.","Anyone interested in this book, please buy it -- but without the CD-ROM. The database is so poorly constructed that it is actually less instructive than the book's index. The search features are rudimentary at best. You can seek only publishers/agents names and the names of authors represented by the publisher, but then you cannot cross reference from author to publisher. That requires a whole new search. The shareware can be found anywhere on line. And the web links don't work. Moreover, the program is continually crashing on my system. This might be a conflict with my hardware, but I've contacted tech-support and, after a week, have not received any response.Again, the book is a terrific tool. Just save your money and don't make the mistake I made. Buy the book without the CD-ROM."
2,sloppy,"This has helpful info, but whoever edited this book should choose another career! This book is sloppy! One literary agency listing has the agents of the company listed, and then the last name of another agent is throughout the rest of the listing. What is this other agent's first name? Ugh!"
3,Heads up!,"It is nice to have a heads up in the publishing industry, especially if you are a first timer. I liked what this book had to offer."
4,a great resource for the beginning writer,"I'm trying to get a book published and this book is an excellent resource on how to write the proper query letter and assemble the perfect proposal submission to a publisher.And, of course, this book has an exhaustive list of publishers of all kinds as well as literary agents. My only complaint would be that I wish they had an index organizing the agents by the genres they accept. It's a minor quibble on an otherwise flawless book."
5,Just a Regular Flag!,I bought this flag for our house in the northwest. It is a nice flag and it holds up well. Not much else to say... it's a typical NY Flag :)
1,Don't buy!,"I bought this for my 4 year old niece for Christmas. While I see her just about every day, I haven't seen her play with this toy since 2 days after Christmas. It falls over. She can't get the parts to stay where they're supposed too. Most importantly, MOST OF HER DOLLS DO NOT FIT IN THE HIGH CHAIR. She's a doll lover with about 30 dolls. Only the smallest (about 3) fit in the chair -- and even then the dolls are so small, they fall out of the seat. However, my 1 year old niece loves to pull the mobile off (it comes off much easier than it goes on) and chew on it (not advised). And the dog loves to chew on the pieces that have fallen off."
2,One size does not fit all,"I purchased this for my wife who is medium sized. It will only fit her head barely with only about 1/4"" of velcro. This visor was obviously designed for a person with a larger head in mind but still, it can get about 5"" bigger to they could have made the velcro path a little longer for womens sized heads."
2,"good pan, bad handle",This is a nice pan but it has an awkward handle. A saute pan needs a handle capable of heavy lifting and this handle is too flat for bigger hands (mine) and probably not shaped well for smaller hands either.It is a shame that the handle designer might have been using a Korean handle design because I have not seen this handle used by Cuisinart before. I was clearly disappointed.
2,"Sorry plot, poor direction......a big disappointment","With the star cast of Uma Thurman and Robert Pattison, had expected more from this movie. Marred with poor script, horrible direction and an aimless storyline...was unable to follow the movie through its end. Do not recommend watching this movie unless you get seriosuly drunk and stoned first."
5,Bel Ami,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, I don't usually like period drama's but I was really taken in by this story. Robert Pattinson totally proves himself as an actor, and the supporting cast is perfect. Loved it!"
4,not bad at all!,"Watched the movie a few times and, though not perfect, it got better with each viewing I felt. Well acted by the entire cast, including Robert Pattinson as 'Bel Ami', who as young as he was when he did the movie yet held his own amongst more veteran actors. George is not a likeable character, but Pattinson's portrayal of him makes one almost emphatize with him at some level, which is interesting. Might try reading the book next."
1,Such a let down,"I was apprehensive about watching this movie because of my aversion to Robert Pattinson. But the rest of the cast are all actors and actresses I have enjoyed in the past so I gave it a shot. My first thought after watching this movie was that Mr. Potato Head could have portrayed George DuBois with a larger range of emotions. Hell any other male actor could have done this role more justice. The rest of the cast are fantastic in their portrayals and it makes Pattinson's acting the more awkward to watch. Save yourself the time and watch an old favorite instead, I personally ran to sense and sensibility for comfort."
1,Not viewable in US sent it back last week.,I was not told this was not viewable in the US when I purchase it. I mailed it back on 11/13/12 to be replaced with one I can watch in the US.
3,Bel Ami,"It's a good movie...I would see it again. It's an interesting roll to see Rob playing, but its very sexy."
5,anything with Rob O in it is wonderful.,Rob Pattinson has a great range of acting he always brings something extra!!!!He would have made a great Fitzwilliam Darcy.
1,$80+ watch not even water resistant???,"I liked this watch, until I got rained on and found out it is not even water resistant. If my son's $5 watch is water proof up to 30 meters, certainly Fossil could have made this watch water resistant for an additional $5. They argue that you should treat it like any other PDA - but it's a watch, too, and people don't usually take off their watches when it rains. Many people don't even take them off when they shower..."
5,Love those bibs,"Am totally delighted with these lobster bibs, simply because they are so inconspicuously lobster bibs, that they can be worn at lots of other dinners as well. I bought them initially as a joke, because I can't seem to keep the front of my blouses clean. After using these, however, I have found that 1) I love using them, and my dry cleaning bill has been reduced by at least half, and 2) all my friends are going out and buying them too.As an aside I have to add that they are virtually indestructible, and that a little soap and water clears even the toughest stains away, and the bib looks brand new for the next time."
5,limp bizkit is the bomb,"Limp bizkit is one of the best bands around. they are awesome and fred is so cute. i love all their songs, especially counterfeit, stuck, sour and of course faith. LIMP BIZKIT IS SO PHAT!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,AWESOME,"If you like Korn, You will love these guys. After seeing LB perform live this cd is a MUST have for everyone."
1,Kriss Kross all grown up...,"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. These guys are soooo cute! I just love Fred. He's so cute. I don't like their music very much but I bought the CD anyway because all of my friends were like, ""oh my gosh, these guys are soooo cool."" Personally, I think the Back Street Boys are cuter. But no one is cuter than James Van Derbeek. He's soooo cute. And I just love the Varsity Blues sound track because Korn really gives it a good effort and all my friends were like, ""oh my gosh, they are sooooo cute."" And then I went out shopping with my girlfriends and they were like, ""you have to totally get this CD because it totally rules."" And I was like, ""okay"" and I totally loved it. So anyway, if your friends listen to these totally cute guys, then you'll like love this album."
4,Got Them Going,"This the album that Limp Bizkit launched their carear with and its an album that is well respected. Three Dollar Bill Yall is an album that is liked by so many people due to its sound and quality that its hard to see that its from the same people who gave us Chocolate Starfish And The Hotdog Flavoured Water. This album contains greta tracks like Pollution, Nobody Loves Me and Indigo Flow. This album is a great bench mark for other artists to follow and improve on. (Track 9 is a cover of Faith by George Michael and its definetly worth a listen)"
1,Would like to inform you woman,I am Melba Meyer Nicholas Meyers mom i am a whore and work the corner 6 nights a week i did fred durst a while ago and he was pretty good. i also say that nick is gay for all of you guys to know
1,lame kornbread biscuits,These guys and Korn have to be the most untalented bands out there. The grunting and squealing is fit for pig mating but not for music. Critical music listeners beware!
2,Not a good album,"This album I expected more from. The only good songs are Faith, Counterfeit, and Pollution. This album is nothing like Limb's best album, Significant Other, where the music is better and louder. I suggest you buy a bullet and rent a gun before you buy this album."
2,this album is old,"I really enjoyed this album a couple years ago, but it's starting to get to me now. I sure hope there new album will be good with all the guest stars on it. Personally i think if lb got themselves a different producer and stayed away from ross robinson they might actually sound original."
5,excellent,"this cd is really good, everybody go out and buy it now!!!!! They're hip hop and heavy metal which is really cool."
5,limp bizkit 3dollar bills,this album rocks from start to finish! its very rare when there is a album where every track is great a must have album ineveryones collection!
1,"limp, indeed.","Not funny, not clever, not original,...not good. This is what happens when people with no talent get record contracts. These guys are about as good as the kid in junior high who changes the lyrics to popular songs to make them dirty. Ha ha, very funny. Ha ha."
2,not worth 3 dollar bills,"Limp Bizkit seems to be a bunch of immature kids, especially Fred Durst. The whole Rap/Rock thing can be good, but try being yourself when you do it. LImp Bizkit just fronts with a tough guy image."
3,the only good bizkit,after reading several reviews of this CD...I noticed that no one recognized track 13 (Everything)....this is quite possibly the most mesmerizing Limp Bizkit song I've ever heard....I found myself lost in it's trance. yeah sure the rest of the CD is good. but Everything is simply amazing.
3,I was disappointed,"The main reason I bought this CD was for Faith, but the rest of the CD sucked. The only other good song on the CD is Stuck or Leech. If I was Fred I would really try and play more like KoRn. So consider in trying to find a single for Faith and not the whole CD!!"
4,LIMP BIZKIT KICKS A$$!!!!!,I HAVE THIS CD AND IT RULES I THINK THEY SHOULD LIKE MAKE MORE CD'S CAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF FREAKIN TALENT AND NEED TO USE IT MORE THEN THEY DO BUT THEY STILL RULE!!!!!
4,This is a good debut!!!,"Out of all of Limp Bizkit's work I like this song best!!!It has that oh so catchy cover of ""Faith"" I *Love* that song!!!Limp Bizkit was introduced to the world with this album it may not have launched them to super stardom,but it was a fair debut for a new band...The tracks that stand out in my mind here are ""Pollution"" this is the first track just a headbanging track about noise pollution,""Sour"" I love that song for some reason,""Faith"" this track is *AWESOME* and I like the end how it says ""You stereotype me cause you don't like me"",""Stuck"" that songs pretty darn good its another rocker baby!!!, ""Everything"" I hate this track its just a damn instrumental with some seductive whipserings from Fred Durst...Well if you've never heard Limp Bizkit's music I don't suggest buying this album first,but buy ""Significant other"" or ""Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog flavored water"" first them ""3 dollar bill y'all""..."
4,Too Much Yellin' Yo...,"This Limp Bizkit album is okay, but not really. I give it 4 stars because of it's yellin' and screamin'. It's a PAAIINN to everyones EARS E-A-R-S Fred. My fave song is Counterfeit."
1,Pitiful,"This group is awful! Everyone of their songs sounds the same. They took a perfectly good song, ""Faith"" and turned it into ****. Do NOT buy this CD, it *****."
1,I hate this band.,"Sure, I listened to the album, went to the concerts, and so on and so forth. However, I came to the conclusion that the album and the band are both equally abnoxious. Mr. Dirt uses his bothersome and whiny voice to copycat Mr. Michael's ""Faith"". Now I'm no audio engineer genius or anything like that but I have a clue what good music is, and this band ain't got it."
1,Limp BLOWS,"""Oh look Nookie rhymes with cookie, now we have a hit song"" come on, they cant wright a good song even if they tried. And Fred has no rang, he can yell, or sing loud. And whats with the guitar players, do they relize a guitar has more than 2 strings? The bass is not used as a snare you know. If you want real metal, go with Metallica (even the thier new stuff is better) or Cannibal Corpse if you want that loud voice"
2,The most hated rock band...,"Fred Durst was right at the MTV Music Awards- Bizkit is the most hated rock band in the world. Why? LB songs are as formulaic as those of NSYNCH or the Backstreet Boys. They sound too similar, and Durst doesn't help despite his fervent attempts to tell you he's quite aggressive and has had a hard life with say-nothing lyrics. Big deal. I have no doubt that Bizkit and KoRn and their numerous clones will continue to rock the charts, but one day this CD will look as out of place in your collection as that Slaughter album you've been hiding away."
4,"""It's okay!""","I like it but, KoRn's ""Follow The LeadeR"" is better than it. But, then again Limp BiZket is pretty cool. I'm a big fan of Insane Clown Posse. I would chose KoRn and Insane Clown Posse over Limp BiZket any day! It don't mean that I don't like them because, I do Fred you rule!!!!!!!!!!!! My friend loves Limp BiZket his name is Logan Fischer from Hamliton Micihgan."
4,this is cool buy it,this cd is pretty cool so buy it. they sound alot like korn only with rap. i like rap better than rock but korn is better than bizkit. don't listen to that moron trendkill because they don't even need to have an explicit lyrics on their album.
5,this cd rocks!!!,"Every song in this cd rocks! I don't really appreciate rap, but this band is really good. Maybe a little too much on the explicit lyrics, but otherwise, this cd kicks! I would recommend this cd to all heavy metal or rap fans out there. Limp Bizkit rules!"
2,LB is alright,"I bought the CD for the song Faith, but now realize the rest of the songs are annoying and bite hard"
3,Not a bad ablum...But nothing exceptional.,"Ok First of I have to adress the notion that Limp Bizkit is ripping off of Korn...They sound very little alike. Sure they both yell at the top of thier lungs during portions of thier songs, but Pantera and Sepultura were doing this long before either band came out. If 'Bizkit is ripping on anyone...I'd have to say it's the Beastie Boy's(and then there's that little spat in the intro which resembels first few minutes fo Tool's ""Disgustipated""-but that was only 50 seconds of the album.) Which brings me to my next point...originality. I must admit there's not a whole lot of it here. They've bascally just taken BB and added a little Pantera into the mix. However this is more than effective enough. Despite the fact that this album is not exceptionally original, or memorable, it's more than entertaining enough. It's just a matter of being in the mood for something to listen to, enjoy...and not really give a whole lot of thought to."
4,Very Good,"In my opinion, this is a very good debut for Limp Bizkit. Thistitle includes heavy, garage-type, thrashing, music. The hard-core hip-hop stlye is a cool new kind of music. Yet, the only problem I have with the CD is NOT bad lyrics, NOT the screaming and yelling, but TOO SHORT SONGS. The songs are GREAT, but it would be nice if there was a 5 minute ""Pollution"" or ""Counterfeit"".Otherwise, this CD was great. I recommend you buy it if you are a heavy metal fan."
1,IT'S ALL SCREAMING!!!,"HOW COULD ANYONE LIKE THAT KIND OF MUSIC? ONLY INSANE PEOPLE WOULD LISTEN TO STUFF LIKE THAT! YOU MINE AS WELL ASK YOUR YOUNGER BROTHER OR SISTER TO YELL INTO YOUR EAR UNTIL YOU BECOME DEAF! YES, IT HAPPENS. YOU CAN BECOME UNABLE TO HEAR WHEN YOU GET OLDER. MY ADVICE: DON'T BUY THE CD. YOU'LL REGRET IT."
2,Hmmm.....,"When I got this CD and heard it for the first time, I was not impressed. I like Wes but their music is not very good at all. It's surprising how our idea of ""good music"" sank to this level. I listen to everything and I usually like what I hear- but this time it doesn't do much for me. To each his own- but there are plenty of bands who have more talent out there."
5,exact replacement for my 2000 Mako Center Console,exact replacement for my 2000 Mako Center Console but I dont see the need for the ball thats included. It easy to install using existing hole and screw holes. All i needed was a phillips screwdriver.
1,coudn't be more annoying,"i watched the first half of this movie trying to understand and enjoy it but it was so boring and meaningless that didn't allow me to watch it to the end.The story line doesn't make sense, the characters are depicted awfully and weird, a boy with long beard, an old woman cleaning a house over and over again, a young man who looks like a girl but has a deep manly voice; all confuisiing and nonsense.but to be totally fair there was one positive point in this move, the beautiful backgrouds which were painted just great and if you just look at them as still pictures, you would say ""wow"" this is amazing;if i want to watch this again, i turn off the voice, put on a soft music, and fast forward the movie to get to those scenes with awesome back grounds and then fast forward it again."
1,"BUY THE BOOK READ IT, DON'T WATCH THIS!!!!!!!!","First off this movie was just awful, i cant figure out why Miyazaki even bothered. The casting was awful, they ruined Calcifer the voice of Billy Crystal was the worst possible choice for that character. They took out a whole section of the book and replaced it with nothing. There should not have been a war, and all of the technology is far too advanced, the witch wasn't evil enough and her role in the story was all wrong. So in the end there was nothing good about this movie, i suggest for anyone who is a Miyazaki fan to stick to movies like Spirited Away, Nausica and the Valley of the Wind, and Princess Mononoke. This movie was too disappointing based on the quality of previous Miyazaki films."
1,literary nonsense,"the move is beautiful but the plot is terrible. everything is totally random and senseless. i guess that's how the japanese define ""imaginative"". i felt like i lost 2 hours of my life after the credit role."
3,"Okay, but not great","Well, I read the book years ago before this ever came out and I enjoyed it very much. Howl's Moving Castle started out following the original story, but alas it deviates right around Sophie's visit to the palace. I was very dissapointed by that. On the up side, again the animation and graphics are top notch, and if anything worth the price paid. So in short, for story, they could (needed) have stayed with the original, but visually, just breathtaking."
3,More like commercial japanimation,"I have developed a taste for Ghibli studio's animations. I like them a lot and normally end up giving them 5 stars. I never thought I would give any one of them less stars than that, but I think this one was way below my expectations. The setting is very much like the commercial Japanese animation you see on TV. Lots of action parts that do not really make the story more interesting. The story has discontinuities, so that sometimes things happen that you don't have a pretex and don't know how or why. Maybe you have to read the book before you watch the movie, or you will gradually lose the chain of events. The only thing in the movie that has Miyazaki's signature, is the moving castle itself. It is artistically depicted. The rest is just like any other Japanimation.In general I am not saying this is a bad animation, but it is lower than my expectation from Miyazaki and his studio (specially after watching his other works)."
4,Miyazaki is a magician,"Wow! What imagery! This is a must-see for any fan of animation.Comparisions with 'Spirited away' are inevitable but if this one does not reach the heights attained by its illustrious predecessor, it is more an indication of the highest quality of 'Spirited away'. Sure, some things are not explained in total detail but hey, isn't that one of the appeals of Miyazaki? Frankly though, the movie loses a bit of steam in the second half but is worth a rental if you just want to enjoy the animation."
4,One of Our Teens Favs - a Bit Too Long for Mom,"Our whole family (kids 33, 31, 15 and 14) are all director Hayao Miyazaki fans and we own most of his movies. Many have commented here before me, so I won't rehash the plot, sub-plots, characters etc.Instead I will tell you that on a cold snowy day with some hot coco and a fire in the fireplace, this is a good family movie to curl up together with and enjoy at least once a year."
5,Howls Moving Castle,"This DVD is an instant classic. Living in japan, it is a very interesting movie. We can watch this one with the kids and stay entertained!"
2,Not as good as Miyazaki's other titles,This isn't as good as Spritied Away or Princess Mononoke. It's not a bad film but it didn't capture me as well as the other films did.
3,Above Excellent Animation but the plot holes overshadow a good film,"Ok, the short version.I live in Japan and I am a Miyazaki nut. Having said that I was a bit confused when the movie first came out and Japanese people gave very lukewarm reviews of the film....still...it made tons of money.I have yet to read the book...maybe I should have before starting this film because the plot holes made me scratch my head in wonder even after the third time I saw it....Who is fighting who and why? Why does Sophia's apperance keep changing? Why curse her?I know lots of Miyazaki fans are willing to overlook the confusing storyline in praise of such wonderful artwork. Sorry folks, I love the guy too....but the plot holes are just too much."
2,Stereotype gone haywire,"The first few minutes were promising and then the stereotyping got to be very embarassing. ""Look we greeks are funny and weird haha."" Laughing at oneself can be a virtue but not if one is trying to make oneself look like a martian.Anyway, I couldn't get thru this thing."
3,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,","This movie takes dull to the max. it is the worst movie i saw in awhile. I'm glad i didn't pay $7.00 to see it. It does have some funny parts in it but it is just to dull for my taste.Plot: Tula has always done what her mother & father wanted her to do(Espicaily her dad) and she is thirty and unmarried. her father wants her to marry a greek man because of her heritage and belives. but when she meets Ian things change big time. can her dad handle the pressure of his little gile having her own free will. well you'll find out when you rent it.If you liked this film check out,1. My Big Fat Greek Life2. My Big Fat Greek Wedding Soundtrack"
1,I hate this movie,I don't understand how anyone can find this movie funny. This is the worst piece of crap ever made in the history of cinema. All actors are so bad so I want to scream shut the hell up. The plot is very very thin and EVERYTHING about this movie is bad very very bad. I hate this movie so much that I don't even wanna hear the name of it. AVOID this movie at all costs. It is not worth your time and money.
5,Wonderful!,"I thought that the previews looked cute. Little did I know how much fun this movie would be!The basic concept is very familiar - older, frumpy daughter seeks freedom from overbearing father & falls for the wrong guy who turns out to be wonderful. However, Wedding brings a freshness to the story. The roles are perfectly cast and the story itself finds new life in the ethnic twist.Wedding reminds me a lot of While You Were Sleeping. It's a sweet, enjoyable film which will leave you feeling good. Given what's going on in the world these days, this is hardly a bad thing!"
4,what is wrong with me?,"I loved this movie, but when I was talking to my friends they all said that they didn't like it and that they thought it would be funnier to people older than us, and that their parents liked it."
4,A nice old-fashioned comedy,"This is a really nice little movie. The humor is quite real and anyone of Eastern European heritage will especially be able to relate to it. The film moves along nicely, and the humor isn't forced. It's a great date movie, but also the kind of film that people of all ages would enjoy."
4,You have to see this movie!!!,"I first saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding alone on the big screen. I had no idea that it would be such a hit.Nia Vardalos does an incredible job about bringing out the humor in what it means to be a Greek American. I laughed before things were even said in the movie -- the Greek school scene, the Greek ""boys"" her dad wants her to marry, the brother, and the pomp & circumstance of the wedding. This is a funny movie, I think for non-Greeks, but for Greeks, it's a must. You have to see this movie. How often does anyone make a movie about Greek Americans anyway??That being said, the dialogue could have been improved. Ian was a bit boring and flat of a character. I suppose that was the point, seeing as we were supposed to ""see"" Toula better. I think if Vardalos had realized what a hit she had on her hands, there would have been more polish on the movie. As it is, it is a diamond in the rough -- more or less."
3,Only one reservation about this good film,"I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't Gone With the Wind but it was fun. I only regret that the male and female leads had sex just a few days after knowing each other. I wish the woman had of held out until she was married to have sex with her husband. Now, that would have provided interesting tension in the film. It would also have been a counter message to what we see in most films these days."
2,MY BIG FAT DISAPPOINMENT,"I bought this movie based on all the hype and was truly disappointed. A couple of funny moments but certainly not enough to carry this movie.I always enjoy Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan and Andrea Thomas but again their comedics not enought to carry this movie. Should have been on tv as a movie of the week.If you want to buy it, get it used."
3,A joyous celebration of kinship and love,"What exactly did producers Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson see in this romantic comedy written and co-starring Nia Viadalos? The answer can also be simultaneously found in this sleeper hit which grossed more than 200 million in the U.S box office with a growing audience. This low-budget vehicle could have been a slapstick perfunctory sitcom outing if not for the spontaneity and sincerity when Ms. Vardalos regards her rambunctious Greek family. Exuding down-to-earth appeals as Tulas, she narrates her troubles with the family when she falls in love with a vegetarian WASP Ian Miller (John Corbett). The ensemble of the supporting casts fill the shoes of her extensive relatives which includes 27 cousins as well as a complaining aunt. They give shades of warmth and compassion to break free of their stereotypical mold - and Ms. Vardalos knows them so well that this becomes a joyous celebration of kinship as well as love."
5,I love Greeks!,"The movie is about a thirty year old Greek girlwho still is not married and her family looks ather like a failure.Then she gets a makeover andmeets a nice non-Greek guy(which her parents are veryunhappy about).I absolutley loved the Greek family,with the adorable little Greek granny(who thinks the Turksare after her).However both Ian's family(not very worldlyand on the stiff side) and Toula's family( warm, loudand always out for a party) are poked fun at.I wassurprised at how Nia(instead of writing a script sayingmy culture is better than yours)just went for the comedyand left all groups feeling equal.Which is probably one of the reasons this movie is a success.I can't wait for the dvd."
2,Some good jokes but too long !,"This movie is a simple story with funny individuals.No real antagonism. It's an easy plot where there is no conflict, where everybody is kind and life is beautiful.Some of the dialogues are quite funny but in my opinion you need more to make a good comedy.The end is too long because there is nothing interesting happening.It's finally as if you see the same joke during the whole movie.Some characters are really too flat.Fortunately i see this movie for free."
2,Dont Bother,"This movie is all hipe and no action. Some funny parts, but over all this movie is a waste of time. Save your money."
4,A Very Greek Wedding,"If you are in the mood for a nice and relaxing evening in front of the TV, this is worth considering.I was not that excited about watching this movie when I saw the cinema trailers, but I decided to see it after hearing friends talking about it. My expectations were fairly low, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover a nicely done comedy about cultural differences.I am fairly familiar with Greek culture, and so I can vouch for the way Greek language and culture are interpreted here. Even the few small bits of Greek spoken in the film are correct. And it gives some insights into the lives of Greeks, who are in general funny, open, and friendly people.The film even has a serious side (albeit one presented in a humorous context): the fact that cultural differences are almost everywhere and they should be taken into consideration in our work and every-day lives."
3,I don't see the BIG FAT deal!,"Although I thought it a v. cute movie/story, I don't see what all the hullabaloo was/is about. Nothing spectacular or wonderous happens."
1,Drop Dead Boring,"This should be called ""Two boring [...]hook up"". The guy even admits that his life was empty and dull before he met her. Is that the kind of guy you would want to marry? Yech. [...]. This movie had no tension, no climax, a few [...] giggles, no real reason to watch it. Hype."
3,It has some funny parts,"Not my kind of movie. Its an ok movie, it has its funny parts and its not so funny but boring part. Its a good movie for people that like that sort of thing."
2,Was this supposed to be funny?,"Okay All I've heard was how funny this movie was supposed to be. Well after sitting through it, I'm still waiting for the punch line. If anyone finds it, will they let me know where it is? This movie was almost painful to sit through, and felt more like a documentary then anything else. My buddy and I both sat there scratching our heads. His girl didn't even think it was so great, and this was a quintessential chick-flick! Guys, beware,and steer clear! You were warned!"
3,it has a few problems to it..,"I cannot fathom why Nia Vardalos insisted on playing Toula, her acting is mediocre at best and actually diminishes the believability of the story.There are also a number of exaggerations in the whole ""crazy greek family"" setup, eeeeeveryone in her family is so crazy and tacky, and only SHE, brought up by same people mind you, is a model of style and taste.She is embarassed by her family yet has no balls to live a life on her own, without them.. what the hell?!First time you watch this movie, it's funny, as all the exaggerations actually surprise you and make you laugh, but on second viewing it starts sucking.. Too bad."
1,I can't BELIEVE this film made bank,"This film is complete tripe. Not only would it not pass Robert McKee's muster, it has nothing but stereotypical, 2 dimensional characters. It is a Canadian embarassment. The testament to this is how quickly the seies fell from grace. One of the MANY problems in this film is the fact that Nia and her husband-to-be simply fold to the desires of the family. She completly gives herself over to her stereotypical family's desires. Disgusting. Not a celebration of Greek culture, rather a racist and trite look at a story no one REALLY cares about."
1,"Boring ""comedy"", and an ugly actress.","One of the most boring ""comedies"" I have ever seen. The subject is the cultural differences, and that's it. It has some minor parts that can be funny, but it does not make it. It's a romantic comedy, that ends with the marriage of the american and the greek girl (that is really ugly) and he quits to his cultural formation for her. Yeah, I know, It's another one of those movies. It has had way to much publicity, and that has make it famous, but overall deserves a big D-."
5,An absolute riot from beginning to end!,This movie was a riot from beginning to end. I am Italian so I can definitely relate to this move but regardless of your nationality you can't help but laugh at the lines. I laughed so much when I saw it in the movie theater that I just knew I was going to have to get the DVD because I know I missed some lines because I was laughing (as was my husband and the rest of the people in the theater). I have watched it at least 3 more times since it arrived. Excellent lighthearted and clean humor! Definitely a must have for your DVD collection!
5,Great CD,This is one of the best albums of all time. I would definatly recomend this to anybody that likes good music.
4,Great.,I love this cd. All the songs are really good and they are not the average band. They are really origional and really rock. BUY IT!!
1,F-,"I am very disappointed. This album is just terrible, i would have expected WAY better from this band. I can't believe how heavily these songs were produced! What happened to these guys!?? They used to be so good...once upon a time."
5,Spectacular,"I just began listening to Kill Hannah last July, and now I'm addicted. I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this band is. This CD is rather indescribable, but I suppose it is at times reminiscent of Placebo. Generally their sound is completely unique, and Mat Devine's voice is unlike any I have ever heard. The tunes are not only unique, but catchy as well. I've had 'Boys and Girls' stuck in my head for days. Their songs have a wide range from up-beat and heavier rock to a lighter, gentler sound all their own.I completely recommend this CD if you are looking for something new and wonderful. And if you end up loving this CD as much as I do, I also recommend American Jet Set, which is every bit as good as this one."
1,Brainwashed from the gospels according only to Paul,Her book is only based on the gospels and all the anti Jewish remarks made towards the Jewish people are washed away simply by saying they are not anti Jewish remarks. This is not a book that can be used as a tool for research. It lacks scholarship.
2,hmm..i dont know about this one....,"i cant really get into this, because i can pretty much do the same thing in my own house (of course, the cops would probably show up). at least with the 3 SYRs they were riffing and there were changes to the songs.i dont hate this...believe me. if you take acid im sure youll love it. but if you want pure artistic noise, pick up SYR 1,2 or 3. the silver sessions is a good record to listen to if yr fighting with yr girlfriend. (mind you, this is the ONLY SY release that i would not give 5 stars)"
2,OHHHHHH BOY,"OH sonic youth fans :( Why must you psyche yourself into liking noise from a band who probably had a chimpanzee on instruments? If you have to take 'shrooms to like a cd, then the music just isn't worth it. YOU have to alter yourself in order to connect with it. Pitiful."
4,Possibly the best book about communication in a relationship,"I read this book in the late seventies because I was a disaster in the area of relationships. It remains the most simple to understand and use of ANY book about communication and developing initmacy in a relationship that I have ever read.Although somewhat dated, anyone who is in an intimate interpersonal relationship -- or wants to be, can benefit from this book. The less successful in that relationship, the more useful this book.""Pairing"" gives practical insights into how communication fails and can work, without a lot of involved theory. It gets to the point and stays on point."
3,Thin but comfortable,This sweatshirt is very thin. It does fit comfortable but is just a lounging sweatshirt or a sweatshirt for the early fall.
2,Beautiful people in an ugly little movie,"I am a fan of schlocky horror and schlockier monsters, but ""Blood Tide"" is so cheap, you barely ever get to see the thing that everyone's so afraid of. A monster hand here...some badly puppeteered jaw movement there...and that's it!The storyline is reminiscent of the movie ""Dagon"" in that a pair of visitors happen upon an island where the residents worship some underwater menace, but ""Dagon"" is a much, much more atmospheric and satisfying movie. As for ""Blood Tide,"" Martin Kove, along with two blondes and a striking brunette (all with giant 80s hair), gives off considerable sex appeal...James Earl Joones adds a bit of gravitas....but sadly, there's nothing else to make this movie very interesting."
5,cool but....................................,"why dont they have songs from fun house mystery , hotel, us navy ,cruise, volcano adventure, us space camp mission , christmas caper, sea world, or shark they should make give us a mystery 2"
3,Crystal Not Made To The Same Quality As Years Past,"I had purchased a pair of these goblets years ago for my parents. Recently, one of the goblets broke so I went to Amazon to see if I could still find the same pattern. Sure enough there it was so I ordered another. It came being as beautiful as the first but the crystal is so much thinner. It feels sharp to the lips and you want to handle it with much care. I don't know if it is just the one I received or if they're all made that way now. Either way I am using the new one with much caution."
4,the crucial point: careers in warhammer,"After all those enthusiastic reviews I want to mention a negative aspect: the character-career modus and talent acquiring system is one of the worst i've ever seen in a role playing game. It'll frustrate a player if he or she wants to get a skill (say dodge blow, scale sheer surface), but cannot while the character is not in the right career. Sure you can handle this as a good game master, but the crucial point is: the career system hinders the players. Besides: the german names for some non-player-characters are too ridiculous for a native speaker."
2,Many more useful books out there,The title just about says it all ... There are many more useful breastfeeding books out there. This book was much too anecdotal and not actually informative. I don't feel like I know anything more about breastfeeding because I read it.
2,Basically an ad for LLL,"This book does contain some useful information on learning to breastfeed, but it is really just an advertisement to join La Leche League. I am expecting my first child in a month, and I do plan to only breastfeed, but this book is very preachy not only on breastfeeding, but also on co-sleeping, mom's who work, and many other LLL beliefs - not just breastfeeding as the title would suggest. Read The Nursing Mother's Companion instead. It is not nearly as biased, and it only about breastfeeding."
3,Bolan Fakery,"Every Bolan appreciator on the planet knows that the recordings are faked and that a statement such as ""All songs are Bolan on acoustic guitar,"" is 100% false. The reviewer below clearly does not have the background to review this material.As for the music, sure, it's not bad, but do yourself a favour and get the originals."
3,An adequate coverage of the subject,"As a happily married man for 20+ years I have to say, some of the spark has fled. I bought this book hoping to ignite a little magic into my often humdrum sex life. The book covers the topic adequately but there is a lot of fluff added that I really didn't care about. To mimic Joe Friday, ""Just the facts, Ma'am, just the facts"". The information I did get from the book has been ... helpful? for lack of a better term. Now, if I could just get the wife to read the companion book...."
3,Nothing new or informative here.,"Nothing new, interesting, or informative found within these pages. Pretty much just common sense. I basically just wasted my money. At least it is fairly well written."
3,useful for beginners but not for experienced practitioners,"This book is probably useful for people who have never gone downtown before or who have limited experience or success. I bought it hoping to learn some hidden secrets that only lesbians understand but I was disappointed. It's more like a 101 course than a master class. To be fair, I did learn one new minor technique, so it wasn't a total waste of ten bucks. That said, my partner says most of her former boyfriends could have definitely benefited from the book."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Do not waste your money on this book unless you do not have clue about women. The book has 12 chapters, only one of which actually addresses the subject matter. I enjoy eating at the ""Y"" and love pleasing women while doing so. I was expecting a ""how to"" book written from a woman's perspective but what I got was mostly useless feminist babble."
1,Talk About Garbage,"First of all, the album seemed rushed. The only good track was this can't be life with Scarface, but then that one even sounded like a bunch of other songs he had done. And to make matters worse, there weren't even any ninjas. One if his worst by far."
4,Straight Fire!,"BOTTOM LINE:One of Jiggas' best!Filled with lyrical fire and blazing production! Not 1, not 2, but THREE monster singles (Change the Game, Give it to Me, This Cant be Life), some nice guesting from the R.O.C. roster, A hot track with 'Face...AND...the intro of Freeway! What more can we ask for?'Guilty...Innocent' was a taste of what SHOULD HAVE been with Kels'...but oh well. :-)"
3,R U OK?? JAY HOVA??,"I've been a Jay-z true fan since his first album ans still i like the way he raps but i donno what happened to him after the album ^Reasonable Doubt^, Jay changed his style and became like most rappers who can't rap needs some featuring fake rappers. I wanna hear jay not his roc-a-fella rappers but in this album jay raps 20 mins or less maybe. Altough I liked some songs like Guilty until proven innocent or You&me&Her. My best track is 1-900-hustler, it has such a good background music and if u put it in the car, all eyes are gonna be on you for sure! I can't say buy it or don't buy it, i'm in the middle bbut i can tell y'all that this is not the best Jay-z album, if u wanna get his best performance but Vol=2 , if you wanna buy new&real 5 star album get Tlib Kweli&Hi-tek. PEACE"
2,Crumbling dynasty,"It pains me to say this, but putting out two albums a year is just not working for Jay-Z. I am a true fan, dating back to ""Reasonable doubts"" days, but with his increased popularity, the quality of his CDs have plummeted. The beats are horrible on ""Dynasty""- and the lyrics don't justify all the hype for Jugga to sustain his title as the greatest rapper of all time. Out of 16 tracks, only #3, #4, #5 and #6 are listenable- and that's on a good day. Listening to J-hovah go on and on about ""The Dynasty"" was more than I could bear, and after realizing that Beenie and Bleek aren't half as good as they claim to be I decided to add this to the pile with Volume #1 and #3, and put ""Hard Knock life"" back into regular rotation..."
2,Is you stupid?,I gave it two stars only out of respect. It looks like Jay-Z has either run out of inspiration or ambition or both. Don't waste your money. Pop in Vol. 2 and forget about it.
3,JAY Z COULD HAVE DONE BETTER,"AS GOOD AS A RAPPER AS JAY Z IS I THINK HE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER BUT THERE ARE SOME GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM LIKE CHANGE DA GAME, GIVE IT 2 ME, STICK 2 THE SCRIPT, GET YOUR MIND RIGHT MIAMI. THAT IS ABOUT IT IF YOUR A HARDCORE JAY Z FAN YOU WILL LIKE THIS ALBUM BUT I THINK THIS ALUBM IS JUST MEDIOCRE."
2,I...only enjoyed 2 song's from this album...to me this was hova's weakest album,Out of all... the dynasty....did not sit well for me!!!....but he came back with a blast from blue print 1.
1,GARBAGE,"read my review on the Outkast cd ""Trashonia"" and that is what I feel about this album. This is not even worth writing about."
4,Somtin Ta Hold Ya til 2001,"I can honestly say 4.5 out of 5 stars. This is a great album with great potential for hit singles, tracks u can bump, club beats but..., this is a ""let's give em another"" album by Jay-Z and tha Roc-a-fella Fam. This is not Volume 4! this is simply THE DYNASTY. Volume 4 is scheduled to come out summer of 2001. Jay felt this couldn't wait, so here it is. But let's get to the review. beats-4/5 lyrics-4/5 effort-4/5 good songs 15/16 - stick 2 the script is alright, but clue ruins it- sorry dog! great songs 12/16- icl.""just wanna love u"",""parking lot pimpin"" ,""soon you'll understand"",and more mixing 5/5- songs come nicely together single(just wanna love u) 5/5- great hook overall 4.5/5 hope this was helpful"
3,Jay-Z's weakest album,"Dynasty is by far Jay-Z's weakest album he's ever come out with. He just doesn't get anything going on this CD. The CD starts out with a really awesome intro, makes you think the CD is gonna be a powerful album. It quickly changes into these whiney club beats. All that gets talked about on this album is money, hoes, etc. plus you have the likes of Beanie Siegel and Memphis Bleek and horrible Freeway on a lot of the songs just totally ruining them. The Roc seriously does suck except for Jay-Z. I fear that now since the Black Album came out and Jay-Z is retiring, the Roc is gonna fall under unless they find some talent. I love Jay-Z...I would've given this album 4 stars if it had less guest appearances."
5,The Dynasty: ROCS! 2002,"This album is shizzit! Damn it's hot. Never seen nothin' like it before. Just got it, today. Oh yeah, The Dynasty is made up of Jay-Z (Jigga/HOVA), Beanie Sigel (Beans/B-Sig), Memphis Bleek (Memph Man), and Amil (Amil-lion). The tracks are hot. My favorite tracks are:I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)This Can't Be Life (feat. Scarface)You, Me, Him and HerGuilty Until Proven Innocent (feat. R. Kelly)This is one of Jay-Z's greatest CDs ever!"
1,What's happening to rap?,"Rap has gone way too commercial and Jay-Z who is actually a talented rapper is only making ""me, myself and i"" lyrics bragging about how many chicks he got, how nice cars he bought, how much cash he can spend, what clothes he wears and how many parties he makes in his 100 million dollar house. This is not something we care about. This is a annoying cd where Jay is just talking [nonsense] which ends up with some soul hook. We got a decent R. Kelly song ""Guilty before proven Innocent"" but that can't save this poor mass production cd."
2,"Get's old, fast....","All the songs sound the same, and it get's old fast. The best songs off the LP are ""I Just Wanna Love U"" and ""Parking Lot Pimpin."" Jay-Z is quite skilled, but if only he would actually use his skill as best as he can. Basicly, if you have bought any of his past albums, you basicly already have this one. They all sound the same. There just aren't any new ideas, and nothing is groud-breaking (Pimpin', Money, and Hoes, there are more things to life then these....)"
1,THIS CD IS PURE JUNK!!!,"Dont even think about buying this cd because it is a waste of your money and time.There is only one good song on the entire album and the rest of it sucks.Poor beats,weak lyrics and boring sound production.He is the most over rated rapper in all history and has fooled alot of people into supporting his junk.Hip hop will eventually meet its demise when people wake up and realize how untalented of a genre it really is.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"
5,The best dynasty,"Is one of the best cd i have ever heard, there have songs like i just wanna love u that is incredible and guilty prooven innocent.Bye"
3,Aiight....,"This is my least favorite Jay-Z album (and I got em all). Jay himself admitted that there will never be another Reasonable Doubt, so I was expecting something like Vol 2. Unfortunately, the beats are nowhere near HKL. I think he should go back to writing his rhymes, instead of memorizing, because his flow has changed a little. Also he needs a better supporting cast because Bleek and Beanie are so ordinary....."
3,Not what I expectec,"This CD did not have the kind of songs that i was expectin from such a good raper like Jay-Z. However, there are 3 song that are ok."
2,Jay-Z has dropped the ball,I was really surprised by this album....I was expecting another volume 2 or volume 3 with solid beats and good rhymes but this just wasn't it....Jay-Z shoudl really take his time to put a solid album together rather than this half-hearted piece of crap
5,Masculine Traditions,"This book takes a more anthropological overview of the European Horned God and makes comparitives between other cultures. It also takes a look at the integration and development of concepts and beliefs surrounding the Horned God. This is then intermixed with various pieces of folklore an tradition which incidently found within traditional Witchcraft. So, you not only understand the information but also understand where it came from and how it developed."
4,The Engagement Party - Barbara Boswell,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERTHE BROODING BACHELORThree marriage proposals and not one walk down the aisle had Hannah Farley swearing off men forever. Until the sexiest stranger Clover, South Carolina, had ever seen turned up. With his black eyes, black T-shirt, black worn jeans and a temper to match, Matthew Granger was an irresistible challenge!But all the man did was stomp around town and ask strange questions. He wanted something--and obviously it wasn't a blushing bride.Of course, Hannah knew there were ways to tempt the truth out of the most secretive of men ....Always a Bridesmaid! -- Five unforgettable couples say ""I Do""... with a little help from their friends!"
1,Upon arrival,"I just received this product on saturday. When I opened the product,which is a cd, the case was broken to smithereens. I almost cut myself on the shredded plastic. Some parts of the case resembles broken glass thats been shaped into slivers of ice. I have not examined the cd closely, because I am concerned about getting cut. I rate the product one star because there is broken plastic all over the cd and I am afraid of getting cut."
4,Fine Movie about the Human Spirit,"I was 8 years old when my Mother and I went to see this movie. I remember how determined this man was to land a fish, any fish, not just a big one. Spencer Tracy was a fine actor and this film probably has been much overlooked, especially by the younger generation, whom rely on special effects more than true human qualities. It is a powerful performance and a testament to human strength , courage and perseverance. I'm glad it was released on DVD and I was able to see it again after many years."
4,Like a dream,"This film produces an unusual effect which seems difficult to describe without giving it away, but I'll try. It is as if you are lying down with your eyes closed, listening to an old man tell a story. As the words of this gentle and noble soul carries you along with his feelings, your mind is filled with rich imagines, and you dare not move or speak in fear of breaking the spell. I think it's like a bedtime story, but for all ages. This film produces it's own unique effect that the experiencer takes with him. You will always remember the salty flavor of it. Tracy has perhaps never been so well placed, he contributes mightily to the effect."
2,A great disappointment to me...,"I love Bernadette. I really do. But I hated this album. I cannot imagine what she was thinking. To me, the songs were bad choices for her, the arrangements were unpleasant, her voice was not at its best. I listened to it three times, and could not warm up to it, so I gave it away. I was so excited when I found it in our town's only music store, a place that offers few items which are not mass appeal productions. I have to say that it probably was the full-price purchase I regret most in the last five years."
5,costume,This delightful wig worked perfect for my labyrinth bowie costume. I won 2 costume contests that night. It will come in handy for other costumes as well.
5,"Truly original, wonderfully delightful reading.","Emma's always known girls are better than boys, but knowingsomething isn't the same as proving it scientifically. So when the 5thgrade science fair gives her the chance to find her proof, she launchesthe most talked-about school project Kennedy Elementary has ever seen. But Emma needs the valiant assistance of her best friend, Louise, when she discovers two boys have set out to show the opposite -- that boys are superior to girls! Soon the school's peace is shattered by a full-scale gender war. Worse still, all of Emma's experiments seem inconclusive. Her project leaves her in danger of failing 5th grade! Nancy Matson's debut novel for young readers is truly original, wonderfully delightful, and enjoyably enhanced by Michael Chesworth's charming line drawings."
4,"Not earth-shattering, but definitely engaging","With HoMM3:AB, I found that I enjoyed that expansion pack but it didn't really keep me interested as much as this one does. On HoMM3:SOD, there was not only a more sinister plot throughout the campaigns, but you are able to pick the difficulty level of the campaign - a sorely missing feature, previously. True, the Elemental Conflux town type is absent from this (which was stupid to remove), and there really are no new creatures. That hampers the game. However, the ability to combine several artifacts to make a super-powerful one adds a nice touch. I found that picking up a bunch of random artifacts in previous games became tedious, but now it's worthwhile finding some of the less-powerful ones just to assemble something that makes your hero supercharged. Is it worth the money, even with the rebate? I can't say it is unless you really enjoy the HoMM3 series. If you are a fan, then the new campaigns and features should keep you rather entertained."
1,Computer Geeks send you whatever they have in stock?,"doesn't matter to them whether the items sent are compatible or not they just send you items that wont work together knowing, according to a customer service operator at computer geeks that the item that you ordered is not in stock they send you items that are not compatable just to fill the order????? I mean what are these GEEKS doing. then you call them they send you an email that gives you a rma number for a return that you have to print,they want you to drop the wrong items that they sent you off at UPS ground,then they call you on a telephone and say that the items will be picked up by FED EX between 3:00 and 8:00 pm. You repack the wrong items put the RMA number that you had to print on the package set it on your front porch, FED EX never shows up package is still sitting on front porch awaiting FED EX? GREAT JOB COMPUTER GEEKS?"
3,Are you Serious?,"We purchased this item for my daughter about 4 years ago. It wasn't then nor is it now worth any more than the original $14.95 that we paid for it. The pool is very small and if you have small children, forget it they will pick up that little ball on the end of it and try to swallow it. And if you are like me, you will want that blender to stop blending at all hours of the day and night. It's a cute accessory but I wouldn't pay $299.00 for it. That's crazy."
1,Misguided Single,"For The Ataris, they truly have made some underground headway. Unfortunately, when you need to make it in the mainstream, you need to start on your own, and try not to sample another artist's part. That came when they covered Don Henley's hit, The Boys Of Summer. This version, was the worst version of any cover song I've heard within the past few years. To me, it is just a dull throwback to the Punk days of the late 70's. Still, if you really enjoy the song, listen to the original version Don Henley did back in 1984. Maybe that one will give you a memory."
3,"great sound, but uncomfortable","Pros: great sound, clear bass, stay in place even while running.Cons: on my head (big) and my girlfriend's (small), the hard plastic of the head band presses uncomfortably against the skull right behind the ear. While I have recommended the Koss SportaPro to many people, I would not recommend these."
5,Cactus is Hot!,"Buy this CD for two reasons. First, it's a re-mastered limited edition by JVC. The Japanese pressing of this album comes in a LP sleeve replica of the original album (paper). The sound quality is wonderful. Seriously, it didn't sounded this good back in 71 or 72 when I bought the original LP. This is the second (and best) studio album with the original line-up: Carmine Appice (Drummer) and Tim Bogert (Bass) from Vanilla Fudge, Jim McCarty (INCREDIBLE GUITAR) from Mitch Ryder, and Rusty Day vocals (Ted Nugent & Amboy Dukes). Second, this is a hard, edgy blues-rock album with one of the greatest underrated guitar players of all time."
4,killed by zeppelin,"early heavy duty rock with a rock/blues edge..this band was undermined by led zeppelin's prominance in these days;but thier work is still self-standing..if you like heavy blues rock music with harp;""evil"" is done well;and the album overall is well executed for the times it represents..now a rarity; but well worth a listen on vinyl first then cd if cost allow..gutsy/blues and all american sounding..not as good as thier debut..ask me for a cdr if you are interested.."
1,extremely poor,"Though this movie had Dustin Hoffman, the plot was terrible and made no sense. Dont waste you time. You can consider the announcement on the box ""international box office hit"" to be false."
1,Jerry Lee Lewis - Live Forever Gold,"This is the worst piece of SH.... I have ever heard. NO NOT WASTE your money on this trash recording. It sounds like a two year old with a 40 dollar cassette recorder was the audio engineer. Jerry Lee is alright, but this company should have to put an inferior, buy at your own risk label on the front of this CD. No consumer should be RIPPED OFF this way. BOYCOTT THIS LABEL!!!!!!!!!!A Friend"
1,Wrong Polly,"I LOVE Gershwin! This show has a lot going for it. But, Jodi Benson is miscast as the lead Polly. I don't know if that's the only voice she's got, but think of Ethel Merman."
5,Jodi benons voice is stunning in this excellent production,"Jodi benson appears in one of very few, but marveolus broadway performances!The music on this recording even downplays bensons work in disneys "" The Little Mermaid""! It is and energetic fun-filled musical, yet it is based solely upon the one emotion that is so ellusive, yet so desired,love. Benson's rendition of someone to watch over me is absolutely amazing!overall this CD is well worth the money you put forth on it. I would also suggest the music book too for musicians as myself---Robert Ellis,14"
2,I Guess I'm not a Gershwin Fan,"It's not that Crazy for You is bad, in fact the music is quite decent, the singers are good, the lyrics are OK, but as a CD its just not one I want to put in and listen to. The music isn't housebreakingly beautiful, the lyrics aren't super witty, and the singers don't melt my ears... so I just don't think this is a CD people must have. There's a lot of dancing in this show, and a lot of Gershwin instrumental music... if you like that, then you will like this CD. If, however, you are like me and need more than tap numbers and cheesy love songs pass on this one. Favorite song: ""They Can't Take that Away from Me"""
3,Easy to Review,"Picture a Tom Clancy novel, but with 1/2 the depth. Still a good in-depth political/action read, it just doesn't take as long to get into the meat. Of course, there are also less surprises."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"One fine day i was listening to Rush Libaugh on my local radio station interviewing the breakout author Joel C. Rosenberg, having writen books along side the great Tom Clancy decided to write his own. Rush had so much praise for this conservative author that i picked up the book the next day, couldn't put it down. Not as long as a Tom Clancy, yet twice as good. Best book i have ever read, and probably ever written."
1,Yikes,"What a horrible book! We actually tore it in half, rather than donating it, so no one else would read it!"
3,Not as good as 12th Imam,"I loved the 12th imam and was really excited to start reading all of Rosenberg's novels, beginning with the very first one. I thought this book was ok, but not really as good as I had hoped."
2,"Not a bad read, but...","I should have known when the front cover endorsement by Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh what the agenda of this book is. The action and events are great, but it feels like pro-Bush post Iraq propaganda. Add to that some downright silly and fluffy passages that feel plucked out a cheap romance novel, and you have a book that was exciting in some aspects, and annoying in others.Read it for the action, be aware of the obvious patronizing."
3,A pep rallly of a book,"If some highly-placed Republicans and conservative pundits didn't encourage the author to write this book, I'd be very surprised. I should have known with excited blurbs from Limbaugh and Sean Hannity on the cover, what was up. The plot's really pretty good if it weren't such a blatant three cheers for the Bush Administration. Even using GOP names like ''Kirkpatrick'' and ''Bennett,'' the main character. There's a ''Sean'' too, but he's died before the action starts. The veep character at one point even uses the phrase ''big time!'' Wish it could have just been written as a straight fiction thriller without the many annoying, not-so-subtle inferences to one very familiar viewpoint."
3,The last Jihad,Refered to this book by a friend. The book is a thriller and gets you from the first page. It was confusing for a while because of the difference in the book and actual events. This goes away as you quickly get into the book and quit trying to make the little details fit. The story does an excellent job of presenting how people of faith(Christians) react to world events compared to one of the main characters who has no faith. the presentation is not over bearing or heavy handed. The people of faith are attractive and makes me proud of our faith.
3,My take on Last Jihad,It was engaging and had some degree of suspense but I was trying to relate to real happenings and people and it wasn't coming together for me.I could put it down and I wasn't dying to pick it up again.
3,"Good premise, good middle - but runs out of steam","I was immidiately sucked in by the beginning of the novel, which has all the intensity of a major Hollywood action picture. Unfortunately, the author cannot sustain the intensity and the ups and downs seem random. Most characters, while not flat, do not have real depth to them either.I was also thrown by several factual errors:* Hussein's sons were not killed in 1996, though this may have been deliberate choice by the author. In that case, it seems strange since it's thrown in as a background filler and does not play a major role in the book.* It's impossible for image enhancing goggles to magnify light enough to ""burn through their retinas"".* Israelis may speak in English with a thick accent - but hardly when they speak to each other in Hebrew."
2,Joel Rosenberg is no Tom Clancy!,"This book is riddled with leaps in plot elements that require the reader to stretch the imagination beyond what should be neccessary in a ""well crafted"" novel. I also am appalled at the lack of research on Mr.Rosenberg's part. For instance, Rosenberg has F-111 fighter bombers screeming all over Iraq. Even a casual bit of research would have revealed that the last of the F-111s were mothballed in 1996. There are other errors such as when a federal agent uses a Smith and Wesson REVOLVER chambered in .45 ACP. Again, a bit of easy research would have revealed that in order to use .45 ACP rounds in a revolver requires the use of cumbersome half-moon clips- something I doubt any agent/officer would use. Mr. Rosenberg is no Tom Clancy! I'm sure Mr. Clancy must have cringed when he saw this bit of literary junk being compared to his body of work."
1,"Please, we've suffered enough ...","If you're looking for an unlikely story populated with Saturday morning cartoon hero and villain stereotypes, ""The Last Jihad"" fills the bill. It lurches along a crude, poorly researched plot-line that culminates in well-telegraphed, brutish wish fulfillment. It's an unending drone of inane situations and dialog punctuated with so many product placements that you'll have to check the cover to be sure you didn't pick up a Sharper Image catalog by mistake. It's a howler right down there with Plan 9 from outer space."
1,Save your time and money- skip this book,"This book is silly. Any parallels to Tom Clancy are seriously misgiven. ""The Last Jihad"" attempts to be a political thriller on a global scale, but lacks character development, and suffers from a very predictable plot. It appears that the author rushed through writing and publishing this book, to take advantage of American anger following the 9/11 attacks. I was very disappointed with this novel."
2,Marginally Gripping,"Sadly, I bought this book based on Rush Limbaugh's glowing remarks. He obviously didn't read it very closely: I found numerous typographical/grammatical/editing errors. Even though the author shows a lot of knowledge about some of his details, and he makes every effort to put the story in a modern-day context, he is not aware that (for instance) the Strategic Air Command was disbanded and re-named the US Strategic Command in 1992. I was disappointed in his use of EXTREME unrelated detail (i.e. the construction and content of sandwiches). His understanding of how leaders in high places function in crisis mode was disappointing. I've been there and no one gets ""cutesy"" in times of stress such as the F-15 pilots striking their target near the end of the story. The reports on the book led me to think we had a new Tom Clancy on the horizon. I'm sorry, but Mr. Rosenberg is no Tom Clancy. His treatment of the story line was totally ""B""-grade and predictable."
1,"Not Bad, Just Plain Awful","I heard Rush drooling over this book on his show (the author is his friend) and because I like Rush I bought the book. Talk about a dull and boring read. Plastic charactors, slow plot development, confusing story line, I almost couldn't finish it. If you have a double digit IQ, this is a must read. If you can walk and talk on your cel at the same time, stick with Tom Clancy. I am very angry at Rush for promoting this garbage, I thought he was above things like that. It spiked to number one in sales after his show, but quickly has dropped to 700. The basement is in sight.."
1,Don't Waste Your Valuable Time,"I've never read a Rosenberg book before this one but it is so unnecessarily dragged out I could't finish. To me, it is an obvious attempt to capitalize on 9/11. Possibly the worst book I've ever picked up."
1,The Last Jihad,"One of the worst books I've read. The only reason I finished it is that I wanted to see how much worse it will become at the end. Interesting subject and rather promising beginning. Very choppy and hard to follow narrative. If it wasn't for almost ""crystal ball"" view of politics I don't think it would see the light of day."
4,It helps to be from the Hudson Valley,"Like many of the other reviewers, I'd read some of Boyle's short stories and this was my first Boyle novel. I enjoyed World's End greatly, but I think my experience is affected by the fact that I was raised in the Hudson Valley. I think anyone from that region who has a sense of history would find World's End a terrific experience. If you are not from there, I would start with other Boyle books first."
3,Good Read,"I thought it was a good read.Well written, with many twists and turns. Also make sure you have a dictionary with you, this book will expand your vocabulary quite a bit."
2,"""The Sting"" is right!","Rarely is a record so aptly named. There are only 13 songs on it, two of which are repeated twice and one, three times! You wind up with less than 25 minutes of unduplicated music out of the 80 minutes a CD can hold. I would say $6's worth. OK, the music is fine, but at a $12 (list) price, this is definitely a fine argument for ""pirates"" who say they'd rather rip off the record companies than the other way around."
5,One of the great rap classics,"This is the signature album from LL Cool J, who may someday go down in history as the longest surviving and most successful rapper ever. LL's ability to display multiple personalities without making himself contradictory or hate-worthy is truly a special gift that few, if any, other rappers have. The title track from this album is one of rap's classic anthems, and ""Around The Way Girl"" is simply one of the best summer jams that's ever been made."
4,Don't call it a comeback!,"This CD contains four versions of L.L. Cool J's #17 hit, ""Mama Said Knock You Out"". It's a great rap song. The four versions of the song here all have the same rap by L.L., but they all have different instrumental backing tracks. Here is the track listing:1. ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" (Original Recipe)2. ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" (Hot Mix)3. ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" (For Steering Pleasure)4. ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" (7 A.M. Mix)"
3,Mama . . .gets all the stars,"I am not much of a rap fan but ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" is just such an intense song you cannot help but get pumped up when you hear it. If you can find it anywhere else on a compliation or Best of then go for it unless you like LL more."
3,Sad and Tragedy,"This Movie shows the German city famous and non famous to the outsider how it looks like 28 months after the D Day ! so sad to see Germany become like that and nothing and it makes you even more sad if you see the newsreel and how Germany looks like before the war.German city were famous for its traditional and cultural rich architecture but it's all ruin !!some of the clips are simply private tour and they don't really take full round scene at each city but snap shots from her and there which make you annoy some times . no narrator and just music "" my way"" on saxophone repeated over and over ..it is good to watch to give you somehow a close idea of how the German people suffer from the war and how their cities turned to rabble due to the Allied Air Raid which is savages goes behind imagination"
2,Dissapointing...........but not surprising,"Vanessa Mae is obviously talented. Anyone who has heard her ""normal"" classical recordings would attest to that fact. But this album is just a flawed attempt at being cool. Sure, her playing is great, and sometimes the idea is what counts....but that doesn't make a good listening experience. Bach Street Parade is the only track I'm fond of, but that one sounds like her violin has been multi-tracked to hell. Try it before you buy it."
5,A True Masterpiece,I found Vanessa Mae's play heavenly. She made me fall in love with classical music all over again. She plays with passion and from the heart. Outstanding performance Vanessa !
3,"This is the ""10 tracks on 1 disc"" version","Made in CAN in 1999, Serial# FGD-58142, Playing Time 69:00I know of 3 different versions with the same title: this one, another version with 8 different tracks, and a 2-disc set; basically, enough to drive the collectors crazy.The music on this disc has been released at least 20 times (no kidding!) on various labels under various album names. It was recorded prior to their first album, and has a ""jam"" feel to it. The versions here were recorded in the studio, so the sound quality and instrument balance are good. The disc contains some instrumental tracks, which showcase the talent of these performers.Check your record collection before buying this, particularly the discs on small record companies. This material is ""unofficial"", and hasn't been published by Sony or BMG."
1,JUNK,"As best as I can tell, he bought some tintypes on eBay, showed them to some people at the Smithsonian Instiution to help figure out what the people in the pictures were doing and wrote it up. He misses alot of obvious things in the pictures, but what can you expect from a has been news photographer. If you want to know about tintypes, history, etc. look elsewhere"
5,addictive-- his witty lyrics and melodies are timeless!,"Try and listen to Noel Coward songs and not smile! You will find yourself wanting more every time that you listen. I had first listened to Coward as a teenager and found him amusing, but as an adult I find his music sublime!"
3,Translation Difficulties,"Part of the function of this compilations inaccessibility, on which other reviewers have commented, is the nature of the translation. For instance, although I have read several translations of ""On the Jewish Question,"" I found this translation to be the most difficult. A beginner would do much better to start with ""The Marx-Reader,"" which includes ""Capital"" part I as well as other important works by Marx and Engels.Rarely do I find a Penguin Classic that is true to the Classic off which Penguin is cashing in."
3,Re-cycled from old albums,"Of course John Hammond can play and sing acoustic blues like few others but the problem here is that this album is anotheer recycling of old material. 99% acoustic in the spirit of Rober Johnson but nothing new. Not Wicked Grin. I would recommend Wicked Grin , Ready for Love, Long As I have You or ""Southern Fried"" first."
1,Not Good,"I had high expectations for this DVD because I wanted to see the band perform live back in the early 70s. But it only played little clips here and there with lame interviews between them. I like documentaries on my favorite bands, but this one was so boring and repetitive."
1,disappointment,this movie should have been better cause the book was superb. Many things that happened in the book didn't happen in the movie. Big disappointment.
5,Good movie,"When i first bought this movie years ago i used to watch it everyday it was like being in a fantasy.only thing i hated was when Whoopi died i think that wasnt necessary,since it wasnt in the book, i fast forward the hospital scene ,otherwise one of my favorites"
3,Roof Heating Cable,"The cable itself was fine and easy to install,the price was good, but the mounting hardware (shingle clips) were rather flimsy and do not hold well. I used a small amount of polyurethane construction adhesive on each clip to hold them securely."
4,Easy to Use Best Price Around,"This is the best price I've seen online or in stores for this product. It was very easy to use and the instructions were simple to follow including sample layouts. We just installed it so haven't been through heavy snow and ice yet, but tested it out with about four inches of snow last week and it seems to perform well. We had another product previously that worked very well, but the cable was damaged and had to be replaced. This appears to work just as well."
4,de-ice kit,I found this system easy to install. It took me about an hour for the section I had to do. I did tighten all the clips before I started. I think they will hold very well. We had some fairly good winds from hurricane Sandy and nothing on the roof moved. I plugged it in before I started to test it and all was well.
4,"Good value, appears to have solved problem","I purchased this product for installation in a valley on a shingle roof that gets considerable ice buildup. The valley faces the sunshine, so even with proper ventilation the ice melts and refreezes. I ran the cable from the house receptacle, up the downspout, through the gutter, and up AND down the valley. We have had considerable winter weather so far this year and I am happy to have the heat tape there melting the buildup and providing a clear path for water to escape"
3,Poor Design on Installation Clips,"I live in the North West. We are having much longer periods of single digit weather this year. We purchased the 200' version. I found the installation clips very flimsy and weak. They are made out of a very lighweight aluminium with 2 fishhook type barbs that are supposed to push onto a shingle and the barbs are supposed to go into the underside of the shingle to hold it tight. I found them coming off the shingle with very slight tugging as I was installing the triangular pattern on my roof. I called the company as to what I might do to make the installation more secure and the solution was to send me another package of clips. After more time on the installation than I planned, I did get them to stay. The system does work if you can get the clips to hold,you will be happy. I will see how they do in a high wind storm. Good Luck EJ"
5,Spell Binding!,"I like music that is different and will touch my spirit; I certainly found this in ""Chant."" The Benedictine Monks prayers bring with them deep inner peace as you allow the tones to wash over your weary soul.Although my natural mind does not understand the words being said, my spirit seems to identify and join with the sincere heartfelt cries throughout the prayers of the Monks. To me ""Chant,"" is a spiritual experience for body,mind and spirit. Highly recommended."
2,Boring Religious Music,"I am sure that some people like this sort of thing, but to me, this stuff is just dull. Now, not all plainchant is a dull as this recording makes it seem, but this does seem to be an unusually early style of chant before any sort of musical elaboration that would make the chants interesting were developed. Relaxing? Of course . . .it out me to sleep! May be good for educational purposes or for devotional exercises for Christians, but I was not impressed."
4,Sanctuary of Serenity,"The Gregorian chant is a 1500-year-old a capella harmony of male voices that transforms any space into a cathedral-like, spiritual sanctuary. CHANT, the first (and famous) offering of nineteen tracks by the Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos (Spain), provides a warm and luminous glow of sound. One is transported to a place of quiet serenity, and the world-weary soul is rested. Those seeking assistance in initiating a personal, prayer-time may find these intimate, ecclesiastical chants to be just the accompanying inspiration they need to get started."
2,Encrypted Text,"The book is very tedious to read and is extremely poorly arranged. The CD is useless. The author demonstrates a great knowledge of what he is writing, but has not presented it in an engaging and coherent form. The most important concepts are mixed and buried throughout the book and must be reconstructed by the reader. The reader does develop a feel for how complex international tax avoidance is and an understanding how excellent advice could cost hundreds of dollars an hour. The summary of it is, there are some legitimate opportunities for legitimate companies conducting legitimate businesses. However, most schemes while skirting the letter of the law violate the spirit of the law and are therefor, illegal. The temptation arises with foreign governments in search of hard currency, willing to hide activities from the IRS. However, international agreements are slowly removing these veils."
5,GREAT ALL AROUND SECURITY,"I have used Norton, McAfee, and Trend Micro security suites in the past. While I found Norton and McAfee to seriously slow my system down and take over all areas of my machine, Live OneCare uses very little memory and can be easily managed. I have experienced no problems whatsoever and have had no networking issues, either. I can highly recommend this for people looking for an unobtrusive, fully comprehensive security system."
3,microsoft windows live onecare,GOOD PRODUCT !! TESTED FOR 6 WEEKS AND ENDED UP PURCHASING !! EASY TO INSTALL...KEEPS SECURITY UPDATED AUTOMATICALLY...
2,Depends on your life expectancy,"If you're in your teens or early twenties go ahead and buy because it will have finished scanning for viruses and spyware by the time you hit your forties. I, unfortunately, will not live to see the results of my scan because it has only been running for 6 months and I'm no kid."
1,generic information,"I found the information in this book too generic to be of much use. The concepts/principles are there and explained well. However, the laws/statutes of each state, city, town etc. vary so much.....the book provides very little information in this regard. Read it for a very basic understanding of the concepts but to get a good understanding of ""neighbor law"" you will have to investigate the relevant statutes and case history in the jurisdiction in which you are operating."
5,LB has gone crazy!,"Lewis Black is dealing with the fact he's sixty, and in this special reminiscing to childhood about how sixty year olds looked to him is hilarious, and very true. His brilliance and smart-ass like performances and reactions don't disappear despite his age, they only get funnier and more addicting. This special is around 80 min. long but I'm still craving for Lewis Black when it's over."
2,Wasted Money,"We watched previous Lewis Black shows, and he was genuinely funny. This particular show was raunchy and not funny. I did not appreciate the over usage of the f-bomb. If you are truly gifted, you don't need to stoop to such lows."
3,Mr. Black,I love Lewis Black but frankly I did not think it was all that funny. It was ok but not near as good as his TV specials. He can do better; much better.
1,WOW,"You idiots....""A Savage Album"" what the heck is that garbage actually heard this piece of crap album for a solid laugh.....and boy did i get one...""perfect friend"" and ""remember me"" where at the top of my laugh list and basically the whole album was crap...old white washed up male trying to rap...the only highlight was the very laughable ""be a man"" because macho man is actually serious about beating up hulk hogan how pretyy pathetic......I SMELL A COWARD, IS THAT YOU HOGAN...HAHAHAHAHA"
1,do you need a good laugh????????,"are you ready? this album , if thats what you call it, is the funniest thing i have heard. alot of hits on this album hehehe. so be a man and listen to this cd. its great to play at partys because when you are drunk and hearing macho mans voice trying to rap, you will laugh all night long. try it."
5,mr perfect you live forever,"This is one of the best CDs to come out in a long time without a doubt. The beats are hot, the rhymes are tight, and randy savage is tellin it like it is. He calls out Hogan and a very heartfelt song dedicated to Curt Henning aka Mr. Perfect. I highly recomend this CD to anybody and everbody.The phrase 'Hot Disc' doesnt do this CD justice.Curt 'Mr. Perfect' Henning1958-2002You will not be forgotten."
5,Pure Genius,This is the sort of album that is so awful that it becomes awesome. Worth it for the comedy value alone.
1,This is the stupidest thing ever,Macho Man has to be the biggest joke ever. Who told macho man he could rap. This Cd is the biggest pile of garbage. Miss Elizebeth died because macho man sent her an advanced copy. I sometimes think about dieing after hearing this cd its torture. Macho Man needs to stick to slim jim commercials and if thinks of coming out with another cd please i hope he gets shot to death because nobody can take torture like this cd. If you think about buying this cd your a moron and you need to kill yourself. This cd belongs in the garbage along with macho mans career in anything. ooooooohhhhhhhhhhh yeah this cd is piece of crap. Don't buy this cd unless your ready yo die. Your better off burning your money because that doesn't torture you like this cd. I beg you Macho Man Save my life and don't come out with another cd.
1,HOGWASH,"Lemme hit you with a little knowledge about the rap biz. It is not a place for the Macho Man to be stompin around in. After I listened to the Intro to this album I realized I was bleeding profusely from my eyes and ears. The next track gave me the runs and the last track almost gave me a heart attack. I hope Macho Man is brought up for crimes against humanity and a coalition of the willing (Hulkster, Ultimate Warrior, Tom Mulherin) stop this godless creature."
1,Isn't there a way to give negative stars?,"I listened to this album and I am glad that I didn't purchase it. This album absolutely, without a doubt is on par with William Shatner's and Leonard Nimoy's. They shouldn't have sang and Macho shouldn't have rapped (if you want to call it that). The music on the tracks are well produced, then it all gets ruined when Macho comes on. He doesn't keep time with the music, lyrically he is limited, and worst of all his delivery is awful. I feel the sorriest for Macho Man when it comes to this whole thing because some record executive talked him into believing that he had ability that just wasn't there so they could get publicity because Randy Savage is putting out an album with them. Not only is his career as a wrestler going downhill but now he has this embarrassment to deal with. In short, this album is the most horendous abomination released in the world of music in years."
2,"If this is supposed to be comedy, then its FUNNY!","I can't in all honesty take this CD seriously. His commercial even advertises to buy it at K-Mart. I crack up everytime I hear it though, so I guess that isn't such a bad thing."
4,Not the 80s wake.,"Do not be fooled people, this is a metal band, not the 80s post punk band The Wake."
4,long wearing comforter,"I bought one of these this time last year and I am amazed how well it wears. I bought another one and it just came in, and when you hold them side by side they are hard to tell apart. I have had comforters by the dozens over the years and never have I seen a fabric of a comfortable hold up and stay looking new like this one has. It's just amazing. And I am not easy on a comforter, the kitties running across them, I am a restless sleeper and I often have it balled up under my knees when I am sitting in bed using the lap top. It's so cosy and warm, without being hot.So why only four stars? The feathers do move on you, creating ""bald"" spots. You have to work to get them around to the middle again. But that is the only flaw with this super comforter. I have seen this same comforter at nearly twice the price in the malls.You cannot beat it for taking tough use and looking pristine a year later."
4,just a few disagreements,"I was very glad to find that Man O War was listed number one. so many people disagree on who's better, Secretariat or Man O War. but Man O War's record is 20/21 with the one loss due to the race started when Man O War was not ready while Secretariat's record is 16/21. they were both against the same level competitors and Man O War won with ease every time. But i do disagree with Ruffian's placing. she was the greatest filly of all time with an undefeated record. I wish Blood-Horse would give her more credit."
2,"Too much ""War"" not enough Secretariat","Man o' War was a great horse, but he was no Secretariat. Secretariat still owns the Kentucky Derby record and the world record on dirt at a mile and a half. In my opinion, Man o' War should be ranked behind both Secretariat and Citation. This book disappoints in its information on Secretariat and greats, other than MOW. There are other books containing much more information than this one."
3,My second Agatha...more disappointing than the first,"OK, maybe there is something wrong with me, but I did not like Hercule Poirot. And I thought from time to time that the murderer may in fact be who it turned out to be but I just couldn't see why. And like I said in my review of ""And Then There Were None"", I don't believe Christie made the motive believable. I got a kick out of Caroline though.I had purchased a third Christie before I read this one, and I exchanged it for something else. I just don't find her stories, or rather, the motives believable."
5,Murder with a delicious sense of fun,"This review applies to the Audible unabridged edition. Robin Bailey reads this story with a hint of villianous egotism inside a sense of humor. As for AG's detection club claiming she didn't play fair with who she designated as the murderer, this is addressed in the film, ""Murder by Death"" by Neil Simon. In fact, she did play fair by allowing the reader (listener) to have almost every clue. Murder on the Orient Express is my favorite Christie film, but this audio version is my favorite."
2,Not the best,"This book began to make to make sense in the beginning, but in the end, the true killer did not make any sense whatsoever. I don't recommend this book even though the beginning is really intriguing. If you follow the characters, you'll understand why this isn't Agatha Christie's best book."
2,Ok but not the best,This is defiantly not the best of Agatha Christie. The plot is just to far fetched and easily detected. Hercule Poriot is one of my favorite characters. Try Murder on the Orient Express or the ABC Murders!
5,More than just a rice cooker,Kk so I didn't buy this from amazon. But I have the exact product and I would like to say this is an efficient rice cooker. Its easy to store and if you don't want to use it as a rice cooker you can use this to make noodles using the microwave and even use this as a bowl itself. Very convenient and makes at least 3-4 cups of rice. Depending on how you like your rice of course.
5,Great rice cooker for two,"Had a similar one for years until it melted due to user error. Great little rice cooker, rice is perfect every time."
5,Nice pin,I am very happy with this rolling pin. It is just the right size and weight for me. Excellent value for the price.
5,Jon Anderson - Change We Must,Excellent. Jon Continues to expand his talents. New Twist to old songs plus bonus new songs and melodies in a classical vain
2,Stick with Living Arts,"I really like the living arts yoga series, but wanted to try something different. Molly Fox wasnt it. I found her difficult to follow- as she moved very quickly- I felt more like I was doing jane fonda than yoga. She gave no instruction to what she was doing, just ok, move into this pose, now this one, now this one- - god help me if I blinked! Not relaxing until the absolute very end- Also the quality of the dvd was [bad]- it looked & sounded like it was recorded in a basement and then burned onto a dvd."
2,its cheaply made,I bought this valve but when it arrived which took forever it seemed it was really cheaply made we only hope it will last until we can upgrade to a more worthy product.
1,Dumb Flicks,One of the worst set of movies I've ever seen. I could barely watch one movie. Could not watch all movies. Please keep your money.
3,MCSE course,"This book is a little strange organized(chapters order) and some exercises cannot be completed due to additional configration steps needed that were supposed to be done in prior exercises, but they were omitted. Not to mention there is no chapter for GPOs."
5,Thunderball,"This was Connery's second best movie.Though it had better action, Goldfinger was better overall."
5,Waiting for entire Collection Release.,"Does anyone know when they plan on releasing a nice box set on Blue ray for the entire Bond Collection. My favorite (Thunderball included) is ""You only live twice"". MGM/Fox was releasing the Bond films with the 3-pack series but stopped before releasing the last few films.I am a huge Bond fan and have been waiting several years to buy the whole collection. I assumed the studio would release the last of the 3-pack series, then offer a really nice box set like they usually do. But it's been a long time since the last release of the 3-packs and the series is still missing several of the films.Any info would be greatly appreciated."
4,Pure Fun!,"Thunderball does not have the seriousness of the first three Bond films. It is not as good as them. Yet it is extremely fun to watch, like some of the Moore films. The villan is played solidly, and Emilo Largo is truly a classic. Bond's new gadgets are extremely neat, espically the jet pack! Sure, the underwater scenes are outdone, but I enjoyed them. They were still action packed. Sure, the Bond girl wasen't one of the best. She was two-dimensional, though. There was no problem with Connery's preformance. He was still marvelous. This is great entertainment, and one of my favorites!"
5,The Biggest Bond of All,"I was around for this Bond films original release, you cannot imagine the excitement it engendered. Multiply this summer's excitement over ""The Dark Knight"" by 2. In terms of 1965 dollars, it is still the highest-grossing Bond. People were waiting out in the December cold at 8am in the morning the day it opened. Like Goldfinger before it, it played at various theaters 24 hours a day. Tons of merchandising were created for this film. I can still remember the excitement 43 years later.Connery is at his coolest in this film, the direction by Terrence Young, (the director of Dr. No and FRWL,) is terrific and this film still has the greatest underwater fight scene ever done. (Compare it to the absolutely mediocre remake Never Say Never Again.)A true Bond classic and one of my ten favorite Bond films."
4,Retro Bond,"When I first saw TB I was coming of age. It was one of the biggest movies to hit the theaters way back. We even purchased an accompanying booklet (which is now long gone). The hijacking of the A-bombs and the underwater scenes were state of the art...way back. The Viet Nam war was still going on, and TB was the most outrageous (and sexy) escapist thrill around. Now, it all seems so retro. Of course, the women are still fine (who knows what effect they had on my sexual awareness and sensibilities?).I prefer From Russia With Love, more gritty and sinister. TB is just fun. This version (with the extras) preserves well the impact and end of the '60s Bond era -- before it goes full-fledged cartoon in the '70s."
4,"Great film, but not Connery at his best","Thunderball, the fourth film in the Bond series, brings back Sean Connery as he squares off against Emilio Largo, the number two man of the SPECTRE organization. The movie has an intriguing plot, exciting action and high tech gadgetry, not to mention some incredible underwater fights. The ending boat scene, however, was somewhat poorly done, obviously altered to seem more intense, which ended up making it look very awkward. Thunderball is not for everyone but is absolutely recommended for any Bond lovers or fans of Connery. Make the effort to rent if not buy this one, as it's worth the trip."
5,YOU MUST HEAR IT!,"This is part of a real big collection, but you can found that is one of the most complete show of Jose's voice. If you are a romantic bean, just hear Volcan, Preguntaselo A Ella, Farolero and you will want first. Then, continue with Lo Que No Fue No Sera, Ahora O Nunca and Almoahada. Mientras Llueve is one of the best performance, one of my favorites. Franqueza and Rosa De Fuego And then, just stop on Tu Primera Vez. Any of them will convince you to buy inmediately."
4,Incredible images,"I love this book! However, if you're squeamish with anatomy and medicine, some of the images might get to you. My roommates don't like this book much for that reason."
4,More than just Life in the Womb,"Most of the reviews I read about this book talked about how amazing the pictures of the pre-born babies are. While this is true, the book is not focused on just the babies in the womb. Only about a third of the book features the babies: pages 36-152 cover conception, the embryo, and the fetus. Pages 156-268 cover other portions of the bodies systems: organs, brain, bone, bacteria, etc.The pictures are all very interesting, to be sure, but I do wonder why hardly anyone mentioned the other parts of the book."
5,Life,A vividly beautiful photo journey of reproduction. Thank you for this artistic evidence of life.
4,Fun political fantasy,"The story of first-term congressman Roberto Huerta's quick rise through the US political system makes for a compelling fantasy. ""...By The People..."" manages to be funny and suspenseful while presenting some serious thoughts about integrity and true leadership. This book has a huge cast of characters, frequently switching viewpoints and speeding through an outrageous plot. While it skewers business as usual in DC, it mostly shies away from partisan politics and keeps from getting overly preachy. Some of the characters are a bit hastily drawn to serve the fast-moving plot, but Huerta and his underdog allies quickly grab your attention and have you rooting for them. A couple of tawdry sex scenes probably rule the book out for younger readers who might otherwise benefit from this book's view of Washington's inner workings."
2,Disappointed,I was somewhat diappointed with this combo DVD/CD. The listing suggests that there is a video of the Rat Packs performance at Villa Venice in 1962 when in fact it's just a very poor audio of a portion of that performance. I know it's a portion because I was at the show with my wife at the time. She also bought this combo package and was very disappointed. The DVD is only of one event in St. Louis that has been shown on TV on more than one occasion. If I wasn't so lazy I would have returned after watching it for the first time. I would not recommend this DVD/CD to anyone who is a follower of the Rat Pack.
2,DVD was made in England! Can't be viewed in the U.S.,"I read all the reviews on this music/plus DVD show and was excited to get it! Only very disappointed to find out when I went to play the DVD show it had a sticker on it saying, Made In Enland! The DVD players here in the US can't play DVD's made over there! If I had known this I would have never bought the set. I mostly wanted it for the show."
5,finally a cool tribute cd!,"I got this cd on a whim, as I was replacing some Elliott Smith albums that my friends have borrowed and never returned (don't you hate that!!) and I have listened to this a bunch of times since I got it! I really like the covers, as I have never heard anyone cover Elliott Smith songs before - I am sure people have but I have only been a fan about 3 years. 5 stars for this nice surprise!"
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","A passable collection of covers; some are excellent, a few totally mutilate the originals, and the remainder are mediocre imitations of Elliott.To be honest, I've heard work that's as good or better from unsigned artists. If your interested, you can find Elliott covers aplenty <a href=""http://www.trashtreasury.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?referrerid=10000269&f;=31"">here</a>"
1,Very disappointing to me,"I am a very, very big Elliott Smith fan and have been for years, the kind who has every recording, live, bootleg, videos of him playing, saw him live, read his biography, etc. I am selling my copy of this album without even ripping it because there isn't a single song on it that does anything new with the music or is in any way better than the originals. In short, they all suck. Waste of time, waste of money. But hey, maybe it's just me....."
4,Good Treadmill for the Money,"I actually bought this treadmill brand new at Kmart for $59.99 on sale. It was really easy to put together by myself, however, after using it once, it sat in my bedroom for a couple years until I started using it on a daily basis a few months ago. -30 pounds later, I have to say it was 60 bucks well spent. You could spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars more for a much sturdier, smoother running treadmill, but even at the regular price, this one's a good deal. I love my treadmill and would recommend it to anyone on a tight budget as long as you aren't going to use it as a towel rack like I did for a couple years."
2,Unreliable Equipment - Worse Customer Service!,We got this for Christmas and purchased a 1 year subscription. We've watched maybe 10 movies through it and it quit working. NO help from Clearplay and only a 90 day warranty! I paid for a year and wasted my money!!! Our friend had a similar problem with the same machine; they bought a new model... it died too. They only had a 30 day warranty.What kind of crap company only gives a 30 (or 90) day warranty and refuses to even help customers who paid for a year subscription.I give it 2 stars because when it worked it was great. DO NOT BY THIS UNIT!!!
4,Rummy with a darker twist,"This game can be fun, but it's also pretty dark. If you really think about what you're playing, it can be a little creepy.It's a multi-player game where the object is to either catch Jack the Ripper, or ensure the Ripper's escape. Points vary according to which tactic you employ.Each player creates melds that are specific to Jack the Ripper's victim's: clues, potential murderers and the like - all of these have a certain air of historical accuracy.The rules take a little practice to figure out, but once you get started it's pretty simple. Like other Mystery Rummy games there's a nice bit of strategy involved.Out of all the Mystery R. games, this is my least favorite - maybe just because of the theme."
1,This isn't YOGA....,...it's modern dance! Go for Molly Fox's Yoga Sculpts or Stretches and Relaxes if you really want Yoga!
5,Great Brewing Book,"Just the right amount of info for the brewer who already knows the basics, without getting too technical. Great book with no-nonsense techniques and advice that made me laugh aloud more than once."
1,The Kindle version is AWFUL,"I've been rebuilding my brewing library on my Kindle since the fall. I find it convenient on brew days to have what amounts to a reference library in my pocket.Unfortunately, Radical Brewing for Kindle is a complete disappointment: it is both poorly edited and poorly formatted. Spelling mistakes abound. Some of the lambic section is entirely, if humorously, unreadable, ""entire rather than using a bf Immediately 20 percent of the mash years ago."" Location 7085. Other formatting problems can only be fixed by setting my Kindle to the smallest font.To add insult to injury, the index, an essential part of any reference book, does not include links or even location numbers. It is, simply, a list of words.Do not buy the Kindle version. It's a shame since the dead tree version has become a staple of many brewers' shelves.Edit: the Kindle version was taken down several weeks ago pending revision."
4,I got a bad copy,Ok this book is great but my copy literally is missing 4 chapters. Remember folks skim through your copy. I wish I didnt shelf this and read it sooner.
2,Unholy Messenger: Would that be Mr. Singular?,"What's with this Singular guy? He's not only wireless but clueless. I'm barely past the first few chapters and already I'm sick of his Christian-bashing and Red State belittling. I doubt very seriously that the ""repressed"" and ""Conservative"" mileau that Mr. Radner lived in was responsible for his ""alternative life-style choices"". Sheesh! Just stick to the facts of the case, Bud!"
2,"BTK is a fat, bald loser","Well the book was alright but I just don't find Dennis Radar, the BTK, interesting. He is just a fat, bald, ugly, boring guy who killed a few woman and masterbates alot. Aside from the killing part, that probably describes most of the people reading this book, including me."
1,Software won't even install,"Make sure you are running Win 95/98, as the software won't even install on Win2000. It starts up, but then complains that you haven't accepted the license agreement, which it hasn't presented, and then presents a series of message boxes which can only lead to abandoning the installation.Basically, this product is unusable on Win2K."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!,Repeat: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. This CD-ROM has caused me much anger and frustration. You are better off without even dealing with this software. It is in desperate need of an update and is difficult to work with. STAY AWAY!
3,A good start,"While the title is promising the book turns out to be more of a collection of literature on the subject. Great quotes about the importance of design can be found throughout the text. Unfortunately, the book never goes into how to use design to build brand value or corporate innovation, although it proves that it should be done. Anyone looking to strengthen their case through quotes, or anyone who is just interested in what people throughout history have done should get this book.Overall, it is a great effort that doesn't quite fullfill the promise. Worthy nonetheless."
4,Design Management: Using Design to BuildI am using this book with students upgrading to Brand Value and Corporate Innovation,Although this book is not written in textbook format I am using this book for class room instruction of design students who are up-grading to a bachelors degree. I feel that this title is also appropriate for those students already at Bachelors level of Studies in Design Management and New Product Management.The book is written in scholarly style and features many short comments by established designers and fashion experts which are included to illustrate and accentuate topics of interest in the Design and fashion area.The book comes complete with an extensive and up to date reference list.I trust that this title will stimulate others in the design and fashion arena to publish their works.
3,Good informational book on design management,Good overview of the history of Design Management and the value it brings to companies
4,Great book,"I look for this book for years. When i found it and saw the price i jumped at it. It is one of the hardest book from Kurt Vonnegut to find. It was in great condition which surprised me cause it came from a good will. If you find this book buy it, its a great read."
2,This book is just a glorified episode guide.,"I was sad to get this book about something very near and dear to me, only to learn it's an episode guide with some information on the cast and creator added to taste.I did learn things about Kam Fong and Zulu that I was not aware of, but as far as episode guides go, they're all over the 'net, some with better episode analysis.I could feel better about this book if it didn't cost $45 (It's about a $10-15 on my value scale). For that money, I expect some interviewes with cast and crew and insights and stories. A major let down. Reads sort of like a thesis that really fails to take a look at the subject."
5,Nice scent and keeps me from stinking. Clear ...,Nice scent and keeps me from stinking. Clear and glides on smoothly. This is the brand for me.
2,"Fun and creative toy, too bad it wasn't very durable and customer service is non-existant","This is a very fun toy, and my daughter absolutely loved it - she even named the mama cat and all the little kittens.About a month after we bought it, one of the magnet nipple (which is inside of the mama cat) came undone, basically making one of the nipples useless. I have wrote to the manufacturer twice, but never received any response.Great toy, poor customer service."
3,It's okay,"Seems like its made kinda cheap, the tale is very thin with no stuffing. I'm sure my daughter will love it anyway. I think its a little pricey for what you get."
1,Pathetic...,"In respected jazz critic Will Friedwald's book, he's very critical of Kiri's lousy recordings of standards(anyone can hire Nelson riddle and try to sound legit). She doesn't pull it off. Pass on this please. This should have never been released."
5,Great cardio workout,"This is a great cardio workout. It reminds me of aerobic/kick boxing type class in the gym, but she has her own twist on exercise. I own 4 of her DVDs and love all of them. This is the hardest workout of them all. If you do them on a regular basis, you will definitely see results that others notice and want! The Yoga segment is definitely enjoyable to strengthen your core muscles. A great contrast to the cardio workout. I would definitely recommend!"
5,"No ""spicy latin music""","The back cover reads,(""The spicy Latin music will keep you moving all the way through!). The music is more along the lines of ""80's club techno music"". The instructor is energetic but pleasant. The cardio and strength exercises are effective...I still prefer Cindy Crawford's The Next Challenge Workout and Pilates Sculpt with Michelle Dozois and Tracy York."
4,Great Workout Combo,"This is my first DVD workout and I can say Im not dissapointed.I love the strength and grace portion cause it's not high impact but will give you a good sweat. Actually both segments will give u an excellent sweat. The only problem is with the fat eliminator, after doing it a couple of times my knee ached. But overall, highly recommended just be extra careful with your knees."
3,This was a so so recipe book,Most of the recipes in this book can be found on-line; and unfortunately there was nothing in the book that was something new as I had expected.Good for a beginner slow cooker for sure.
2,"Author loves her PEPPERCORNS AND ONIONS (Switch it up, will you?) NOT IMPRESSED","I would have given it only 1 STAR, but I did like the BBQ sauce recipie. Other than that, not impressed with the rest.I made several dishes before I could judge, and really I don't mind all the ""Prep work"" involved, but with all that effort, one would think you'd get a better final product. Most looked like slop and the flavors were not as good as some other cookbooks I have already. This author seems to Love her peppercorns and onions (I don't mind them either, but jeez- it's like EVERY recipie).I will be selling this book at my next yard sale since I made my notes on the pages & can't return it.BUMMER waste of $$"
3,Cantatas for Christmas,"Telemann had one of his biggest commercial successes with the Harmonischer Gottesdienst - small scale church cantatas which could be sung by Hamburg's middle classes as well as in churches, and they show a more intimate side to the cantata than the large scale forces we are used to with Bach.The performers here are all dependable specialists in this area: Monica Frimmer (Soprano), Rufus Muller (Tenor), Gotthold Schwarz (Bass)."
1,NOT MAC OS,"I haven't heard back from either the seller of this CD nor the actual software developer, but, I just received the CD in the mail today and I'm angry that it's advertised as MAC OS compatible..... it is NOT! I can't open any of the files and there's no ""install"" file. Just a lot of files that my MAC G4 on OS 9.2 can't open. What a hoax!"
5,Great R&B dance song!,Wow! This song is great! I love this song alot. Chris Brown could be the next Usher.
4,enjoyable,"This is an enjoyable love-triangle comedy, where the men start by rivaling each other over the woman but then discover that they are incomplete without each other and the woman. Excellent casting and acting. Seeing Huppert (in a minor role) is an extra bonus."
4,great CD,"Received the CD fast, plays well, although the CD case is cracked which doesn't affect the playing, but not a bad deal for the price."
3,"THIS IS KIRI'S BEST CD, BY FAR.",I HAVE MOST OF KIRI'S CDS OF POPULAR MUSIC. THIS BY FAR IS HER BEST CD THAT I OWN. SHE USES JONATHAN TUNICK AS ARRANGER AND HE IS GOOD.I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS CD A HIGHER RATING BUT I ONLY LIKED 7 OUT OF 14 SONGS. IT'S HARD TO COME UP WITH ENOUGH FRESH IDEAS TO CREATE A 5 STAR CD.
1,wrong roles for a dame,"Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, with all my applauding hands on her appearance in other recordings like Bernstein's West Side Story with José Carreras, and with all my respect for a fantastic career recently ended, I have to say that in standard songbooks used to play a wrong role, by compulsive advancinng herself to the refrains of songs, at the point that it seemed that she was the orchestra conductor at the moment: the musical effect produced is anoying and hard, please note that on 'Kiri sings Porter' almost all tracks were originally meant for male roles."
4,White box-so what!,"I guess my kids are different from all of your's. Mine don't stop at the box when unwrapping. They go straight in and investigate everything!As far as I'm concerned, the plain box make the suspense last a little longer. It's kind of a let-down when you've unwrapped the box and it's obvious what's inside before you open it. No need to go on then. When I was a kid, we used to have to try and guess what was in the box before we unwrapped the gift. It made it even more fun and slowed down the greedy unwrapping frenzy that occurs on Christmas morning.Besides, the plain box makes it easier to hide what's in it from little eyes before Christmas! I don't get to shop without my 2 yr old, so it gets tough to hide her gifts from her! Also, we don't have much ""out of sight"" storage space for hiding things."
4,An excellent book,"A very interesting book. As always with Graham Greene, it is very well written, but it is also a very observant portrait of not only Omar Torrijos, but of Panama and Central America during the late 1970's and early 1980's. Well worth buying."
5,An astonishing film,"""Jindabyne"" is a most compelling and intelligent film. I was absolutely riveted and entranced while watching this study of the erosion of our out-of-balance society. But what really makes ""Jindabyne"" one of the highest quality films I've ever seen is the beautiful and subtle screenplay that does a wonderful job of demonstrating the ways of the modern world, how out-of-touch we've become with nature (which includes ourselves and each other), and how this affects everyone and everything. I've read some comments to the effect that this film bashes the dominant (i.e. white) culture, but really no one gets a pass in ""Jindabyne."" Rather, this work looks at the after-effects of Western Expansion and the consumer culture it's created (while essentially destroying the divine nature of the world) and it does so in an entertaining, edgy manner. I could not recommend this fine work of art more."
2,Another Dead End Movie,"After suffering for more than 2 hours thru an extremely slow and often muddled and boring movie I at least expected some kind of closure.It seems to be the trend nowadays to leave the viewer guessing. The bad white people AGAIN are made out to be the villains and getting punished for not reporting a murder victim immediately (although they are out in the boonies and it is made clear that the cell phones do not have reception in the area). Haunted by the press and local opinion, not to speak of family problems and being spit on and vandalized by the local aborigines tribe, who ""NATURALLY"" have every right to do so!! At least I didn't see any police presence for these acts of violence. In the meantime the murderer sits in his truck waiting for his next victim - END OF STORY! Are you tired of all that political correct mush yet?? If yes,don't waste time or money on this one. 2 stars for decent acting."
3,good sound. not very comfortable.,"The sound quality is good, especially in this price range. I however find it quite uncomfortable to wear. When I wear it for more than half an hour my ears really hurt. It could be different for other people though."
1,Nada,Had tons of flys in my house so I discovered how they got in and plugged the leak then hung a couple of these ribbons from the ceiling and didn't attract a single fly. What a waste!
5,Great Book,"Great Book, very intuitively. I'd definitely recommend this book to all economics students or in any kind of dicipline that has to be with it ."
1,Net Whiners,"This book may have been relevant two or three years ago, but it's just whining at this point. Netslaves is devoted to lamentations about how workers were victimized by greedy evil bosses, when in reality the workers were just as greedy. If you can't accept the consequences of your decisions, you'll like this book."
3,why the anti-christian bigotry?,"i liked the movie, i love end of the world as we know it zombie/vampire movies and books... i deducted a star for the anti-christian theme that was totally unnecesary for the plot line..."
2,STINK LAND.......,"With a movie of this gener you have got to have at the very least strong acting and good makeup this film does not have one or the other the makeup is a joke and the acting is the punchline please do not waste your time or money, I turned this film off and threw it in the trash after 15 minutes however I did save the case as to get something for my money. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is there is actually even worse movies of this genre than this one. Don't bother.SCOTT M"
2,Stake Land,The movie was dragging past one hour but up to that point it was reasonable. The ending was a huge disappointment.
2,sad,"I don't have the movie but it was on TV & saw about half. I'm sure parts were cut but from what I saw this movie was so sad, especially when the pregnant girl was tortured & killed. Maybe it showed what it really would be like if something like that happened but I see enough horror on the news & watch a movie to get away from life. One person said it was like Zombieland & Dawn of the Dead. Have to disagree. Zombieland WAS a comedy, gross in some parts but funny with a good ending. But really, they have electricity but can't take a shower? It's a fantasy, funny movie that I enjoyed."
2,Not worth the money,"The movie was slow, uninteresting, and brought nothing new to either the vampire or zombie genre. Do yourself a favor and skip it."
1,Terrible Flow,"This book is not organized well at all. There is a lot of repetition in the chapters and they are extremely long with a lot of information contained in each chapter. Many of the examples seem irrelevant and the book just does not flow well. It seems Dr. Kotler is attempting to use the same old dry text with modern updating that makes this book long, confusing and boring."
5,John Raitt Stars Forever,"This album is the best of John Raitt, with the welcome addition of three duets with his daughter Bonnie. If you ever followed Mr. Raitt on Broadway or in summer stock, you will love this album -- his voice when he was in his mid-70's hardly varied from his voice as a young man. Some of his biggest shows - Carousel, Pajama Game -- are represented here. Rogers, Hammerstein, Berlin, Porter -- they were the brains that created the modern musical from musical comedy, but it was John Raitt and his colleague Francis Drake who make their ideas work every night on the stage. This album is a welcome reminder."
5,I've done his tour & heard the pre-release. IT'S FUN!,"Well, I saw Jonathan play the tour behind this album many a time, and now that some people have found out about my underground love from the movie ""Something About Mary"" they can enjoy him, too! This is not publicly released yet, but I heard the pre-release weeks ago, and it is so FUN!! Just buy it! (if you like silliness & awesome guitar and lyrics and a cutie singin' at the same time!) and dancing and going barefoot and well, not being too serious (yuk! life's too short!) Have fun and buy it!"
4,What Price Glory,"A very enjoyable James Cagney movie, very little war, mostly comedy. The film has been very well remastered. Dan Dailey, who was 11 years younger than James Cagney and also an excellent 'song and dance man' plays a brilliant character as a foil to Cagney. Highly recommended."
1,Kindle version of this book is unreadable,The Kindle edition of this book IS UNREADABLE. Pages are scanned in pieces and at 90 degrees on the screen.
3,Threads Von Payment: The Very Important Reason for the Disappearance of the Great Obviator,"The book did not meet my expectations. Good, but not noteworthy. The movie is better than the book. The drama, in this instance, must be visual and unilaterally applied. The story's conclusion is screechingly abrupt, and I am not talking about the landing!!"
2,Not my favorite,I have loved all the other albums and review said this was great. It just was not for me.
1,Everiting was great untill it stop working.,"I got this camera in July, and I was able to take many nice pictures. But just now when I turn the camera on it freezes and it don't respond to any button. It does not work any more."
5,Leica and Panasonic have done it.,"Manual controls are a plus on this camera. The build quality is very good. Close performance to my D-SLR camera, except for the viewfinder and colors at ISO over 100.The best value from Amazon. This is a very good first camera for a person who is serious about photography on the budget."
5,"I not only fell in love with it, I bought one as a gift","I purchased this camera going on a year ago, after reading several favorable reviews. Before I had a chance to use it, however, my in-laws headed to Africa for a safari, and I insisted that they take it along.The pictures they returned with were fabulous, as have the pictures I've taken since. I'm very pleased with the unit.My only (minor) critique is with the extension for adding on filters; this ought to be part of the main lens assembly, not requiring an add-on. A minor point, though.Is it the most faboo camera out there in its price range? I really couldn't say. Is it a great camera in and of itself? Absotively."
5,Among the best 5MP Digital Cameras available,"The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20K 5MP Digital Camera looks and almost acts like a 35mm digital SLR, but with two major differences. First, it is much smaller than a full-fledged 35mm digital SLR from the likes of Nikon, Canon or Minolta. But more importantly, it has an image-stabilized non-interchangeable Leica Vario-Elmarit zoom lens which is undoubtedly one of the finest lenses available in digital photography. I have become quite a fan of Panasonic's Lumix line of digital cameras, and this camera is yet another excellent representative. I'm quite impressed with the optical excellence demonstrated by the Leica lens, though frankly I am not surprised, since I rely extensively on Leica optics in my Leica M rangefinder camera kit. If you are someone seeking the best optical performance possible from a 5MP digital camera, then you surely won't go wrong acquiring this Panasonic Lumix camera."
5,What a camera!!,"Having shopped for several months for a digital camera - this Panasonic is amazing - easy to use, great results and a great value for money.3 friends have see my results and have now purchased this product."
4,Excellent Camera but Bulky,This is an excellent camera except for the size. I had it for almost 8 months and very happy with it. Recommend it if you don't care about the bulkiness.
1,fail,Its not a layered approach as in muscles and skin but in shading and such and its not even that good. If you need anatomy reference go else where
4,A collection of great instrumentals,"Ian Anderson has always been known for his flute. What we have here is a flute player arranging and playing some very innovative flute.The entire album is instrumental, so we miss out on Anderson's outstanding lyric writing talents.Ian trades his lyrics in for some of the finest flute music you will ever want to hear.There is not a bad song on the CD. The highlights for me include, In a Stone Circle, In the Grips of Stronger Stuff, and in defence of Faiths. These 3 compositions are not only outstanding but will stand the test of time, which in my mind is the only true test of music. You will never hear Ian Anderson compose anything more solid. The rest of the CD is basically elevator music with occasional highlights.Ian plays the flute in his patented style and is in top form.This is much better than its predecessor Walk into Light.If you are a Jethro Tull fan this should interest you."
2,dull,"This is what William Goldman would call a ""medicinal"" movie. Because it's politically correct and addresses serious issues, you're supposed to be in awe of it. Because it's good for you and medicinally sound. One failing is that it is tedious to sit through. And, personally, I can't stand Toby Maguire (even though he's probably a very nice person). His high monotonous voice, and thin-lipped, bulgy-eyed face and narrow acting annoys me. The movie is beautifully shot...but what big budget studio movie isn't beautifully shot these days. Caine and others are good, etc. But when people say ""The stars were good, but the material wasn't"" it should sink into their skulls that acting is much easier to pull off than writing (10 year olds win asting Oscars, but not writing Oscars...that tells you something). If you're a sucker for period pieces and don't mind glacial pacing, check this out. But otherwise forget it."
4,near excellent film,"The acting, scenery, dialog, technical effects of this film deserve the highest of kudos. I only add my ""two cents"" as a cinema perfectionist. One flaw grabbed hold of me and caused a slight distraction. Because of my age and the area of my upbringing, ie. southern california, I know that the drive-in movie did not come about until 1949 and certainly not earlier in coastal maine. So, the scenes at the drive-in should have been reasearched a little further. Other than that, a very, very fine movie. Caine was supurbe, if, for no other reason, how he managed to supplant his delighful cockney accent with the new englander non-accent that he chose to use."
3,"Lobsters, apples and abortions","Well acted and interesting story centered around New England orphanage. Toby Maguire plays orphan/physician's assistant to Michael Caine's gruff but loveable doctor/abortionist. Although essentially a subtle paen to the abortion culture, the movie is redeemed *somewhat* by its interesting characterizations, beautiful cinematography and fine acting by the principals. The pro-abortion innuendoes are all too apparent to students of this violence. Yet in a curious and inexplicable lapse, the producers fail to justify their ""safe abortions"" premise--virtually all of those involved in the crime meet unhappy fates! Still, a good film if one knows how to objectify these things."
5,The Cider House Rules,"Our son and family were visiting and they have a 5 year old daughter, she watched all of the movie.Just wonderful to find something the entire family can watch together. Not to have to worry aboutthe language or sexual content. Wonderful, wonderful family movie."
5,Magic!,"A magical movie, now available for lessthan box office admission in my city, and thisis high quality blu-ray. If you have never seen it,it is a treat."
2,Two Stars for Actors' Performances......,"but don't be fooled. This movie is a two hour cleverly/not so cleverly disquised pro-abortion advertisement. If this bothers you avoid it. Had this film been set in current times instead of the 1930's it would be ever so obvious. I was not so much offended by it as I was troubled. This is not a family film. It explores three different excuses for abortion: woman's right to choose, if abortion is not legal women will harm themselves and a case of pregancy as a result of rape/incest also included are the plight of orphans and the pain of a woman giving her baby up for adoption. So be forwarned and unless you are very pro-abortion and want to pass that on to your kids stay away from this film."
3,"Loved the book, liked the movie","I enjoyed this movie. It was well-made and well-acted. My only issue with it is that it lacks the depth of Irving's novel. Obviously, recreating that would be a near-impossible feat in this medium. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but in this case I'll take the words."
2,Simplistic toy with little educational value,"This toy is very simple. The functions are minimal. The voice on the toy is very robotlike, rather uninspiring. Even my 1 year old son lost interest in the toy after half an hour. It held very little interest for my 3 year old boy as well."
2,Not impressed...,Have to say that I got this on Amazon for [...]. I'm glad I didn't pay a cent more. This is borderline okay... I found it a bit loud and annoying. My 2 year old might like the aspect of the stylus... we'll see. I just have to say that I thought it was nothing spectacular and certainly wouldn't spend $[...] on it.
1,shut up already!,"The toy has no on/off switch. You activate it by pushing a button or touching the screen. So... everytime the thing gets moved, it starts talking. Very annoying, and neither of my kiddos are interested at all in it."
1,skip this one!,"I found this toy at the family dollar store for about [...] and it looked fun...it is boring, non-interactive, and it does the abc song but not with the right rhythm. I too have had it speak to me when I least expect it. I am shocked at all of the great reviews--it is definately one that I would have skipped! For a toddler, there are many 'soft' toys that teach letters and numbers or colors (soft toys make less dangerous projectiles when a 2 yr. old decides to throw!!) like the leappad caterpiller that has been the BEST toy for the car since birth and still today.[...] or for an 'electronic' look alike, the baby einstein music player"
2,Inaccurate,"The readings on my thermometer are way off... a medium rare london broil registers at about the 'g' in Progressive and boiling water at about 165 degrees. I only used it once, and thankfully I was keeping an eye on it so my london broil didn't get over cooked. Anyway, this product was a waste of $10 for me... too bad because if it only read the temperature right, I love everything else about it!Edit: I was just about to throw it away when I took off the silicon and realized you can adjust the dial on the thermometer... now I just need to find some way to calibrate it... wish THEY had done this part, but I'm at least glad that it's not a piece of junk anymore."
4,progressive thermometer,I bought this as a gift. My mom uses it all the time. I'm guessing since she uses it all the time that she likes the product:) Mom approved.
5,Just The Facts!,"Ignore ""A reader from China""'s review folks. I have read both the 1979 edition & the 1987 updated & expanded edition. It only got better & more informative. Read the copyright in the begining of the book. Mr. Kearny hasn't maked a dime off this book, he just wan't you to survive."
4,I was very excited to try this item. ...,"I was very excited to try this item. But when I opened the tube to apply the wax, it just kept coming out into the lid (what a waste). When I spread the wax on, it did tug a bit at my leg hair. Then, if I didn't rip fast enough, or had too much wax, it felt like I was ripping my skin off. Once I got the right combination of wax application and speed it worked. Overall, it was a little messy. But my legs stayed smooth for a long time. I wonder how many applications you're supposed to get out of this tube. It took quite a few strips to do both my legs. I guess this kit is okay, since waxing lasts a lot longer than shaving and this wax cleans up well. However, the price is so-so for me. How many times I can wax per box will be the biggest factor in whether I buy it again. I'd really recommend it to friends who want to use it for smaller areas, since they could get lots of applications out of one kit."
5,I was very pleased with the performance of ...,"I was very pleased with the performance of this particular Mitchum deodorant. It feels fresh and lasts all day. My main dislike with deodorants and anti-perspirants is that they feel uncomfortable. This one however, doesn't even feel like it's on, which is the way it should be. I would definitely recommend it for any man."
5,Most effective anti-perspirant on market,"Most effective anti-perspirant on market The problem is, you can no longer find Mitchum solid in stores. Even ordering thru Amazon, my full order was not available. Please bring it back. ASAP!"
4,Free SF Reader,"I have to say it took me quite a few sausage roll lunch hours to get through this one as a kid. There is no doubt it is very interesting and important for the whole Arthur thing.Those interested should definitely check it out from that point of view, even if only having a browse, it is well worth the time to see the origins of a lot of this."
5,A great story beautifully told,"From beginning to end, this story braces the imagination, and takes one to a place and time where faith, honor, and courage were central. You just may find yourself admiring and beginning to love some of the knights and damsels you're reading about. When I finished the book and put it on the shelf, it was a lot like saying good-bye to a friend.What makes the book even better for a modern is that Mr. Matthews' edition has rendered it extremely readable, while still keeping the ancient flavor that helps put aside for a moment the outlook of the present century. And Ms. Ferguson's excellent drawings of various scenes, interspersed throughout, are further delights that help the mind paint its own pictures along the way.It is said that Arthur's story is known throughout the world. That must be in part because the story is great; and this edition tells it very well."
2,Overbrief Translation,"In his preface, the translator Keith Baines asserts that he attempted to ""provide a concise and lucid rendering of Le Morte d'Arthur"" and to clarify ""those episodes which, for the purpose in hand, seemed obscure, and condensing those which seemed prolix.""As an example of this condensation in progress, Baines version of The Tale of Sir Launcelot du Lake is 19 pages long. Steinbeck's translation of the same story (which had the goal of accurately preserving the story as told in the Winchester Ms.) runs over 100 pages. Throughout, Baines' edition is horribly abridged. He leaves most of the basic facts from the story intact (though some parts of his translation, especially concerning the obscurer genealogies, are plain wrong when compared to most other editions). However, he cuts all elements that make reading the legend enjoyable."
1,Don't rent THIS verision,"While this is a reasonably enjoyable bit of spy vs. spy escapism, the quality of this rental download is pathetic. I rented this film to watch on my laptop during a recent airline trip and frankly, I was a bit shocked. It's quite obviously been transferred from a twenty year old edited for TV analog video tape complete with choppy breaks for commercials and awful audio and video quality.Amazon should really be embarrassed to offer (let alone charge money for) this version. This is certainly not what customers expect when they rent or purchase an Unbox Video. (Thankfully, it's the exception and not the rule)"
1,Read the Book Guys....,I read the book and i must say i was really impressed so i was really looking forward to seeing the movie when it was on tv the other night. That is where my views changed and by the end of the film i was very dissapointed. The acting in the movie is absoultely terrible. All the Russians have american acents and loads of important parts in the book were left out which would leave someone who had not read it very confused. Caine is good but brosnan has had way better days.Please do yourself justice read the book as it is fab
4,Good sci fi mystery which deserves a nicer cover,"Despite the saying about not judging a book by it's cover, I'm as visual a creature as the next person, and I almost didnt borrow this book at the library when I couldn't find another book on the shelves. I'm surprised how easy and enjoyable it was to read. Plenty of aliens, and plenty of intrigue, with several left turns which left me guessing!It's a good sci fi yarn which, as I said before, deserves a more classy cover.That's it! Short and sweet, just like the novel."
5,Man's quest for the absolute.,"Using St John of the cross as a reference point, Brother Hall conveys the essential trials and tribulations all seekers of truth must at some time face. He terms this period of trial, after St John of the cross, the ""Dark Night of the Soul"". A period when we must reevaluate all we thought or believed we knew in the light of higher truth. Highly recommended!"
5,smells great,Smells awesome. A thing I like to do is get close to a female while I notice her head move up toward me as if trying to get a closer smell.Very fast shipping and in good packing.
1,MINDBOGGLINGLY HORRIBLE,"I read this book because I have read them all and must find eventual absolution, even at the price of extreme boredom, but after the last few books I had few expectations. Well, I should have had NO expectations. This is even worse than Path of Daggers....This book goes on ad nauseum about nothing...Perrin doing nothing, Elayne doing nothing and plotting about nothing, Matt doing at least a little something, and Rand doing a bit, as well as doing his concubines. Unfortunately, to get to anything that is interesting, you have to wade through page after page of useless descriptions and dialogue that seem to be there only to take up space. They don't really matter. After the first painful 200 pages, I started just skipping most of it and just reading parts that seemed pertinent, and even most of them were not...."
1,Maybe I can still return it!,"This book is just more of the same, a story that goesnowhere. It's to bad, the first 5 books were great. Maybe he forgothow he was going to end the story, now he just writes aboutnothing. That's it for me, I won't waste [money] on Jordan again. Ifyou want great fantasy look to George R.R. Martin."
3,What happened?,"I am very disappointed. I raced through books 1-8, eagerly anticipating the further adventures of Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Elayne, Nyeaeve, Lan, Loial, etc. I'm stuggling even to finish this one. Jordan has brought in too many new or barely mentioned characters this time around. Yes, there are continuing stories of the old characters, but there sandwiched between chapter after chapter of characters that I don't really care about. What I really wanted to read, was that Moiraine really wasn't dead, that she had somehow been caught up in some thing, and would reappear or the others would come upon her (maybe as a slave without her memory?) I only started reading this series a year ago under protest, but was immediately hooked. If this new book is a sign of what's to come, I'll quit now, while my opinion of books 1-8 still stands as outstanding!"
4,Winter's Heart,"Robert Jordan keeps the series very much alive with another amzing book in The Wheel of Time Series. If you have not read any of the series so far, i suggest you begin. The very first book, The Eye of the World is great, and each book after is better than the last."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I started reading this series more than 10 years ago. It was great! For a while. Then it started to become less than expected. Still I looked forward to the next book in the series. Now, after one less thrilling book after another, and the lack of anything from Mr. Jordan in a very long time, I have decided that if there ever is a 10th book, I will probably not buy it. For those readers who have not given up yet, I salute you."
2,Subplots are distracting from this series!,"My wife got me hooked on ""The Wheel of Time"" series - I thought for years they were just more of her romantic novels. Then I started reading them. I was astonished by the first several books, finding a world to rival Tolkien's! Characters to care about and root for! Descriptions of places and events to surpass others I had read.But now I have become concerned that I am reading ""the never ending story""! Particularly after ""Winter's Heart"", I am concerned I shall loss patience and never know what became of our heroes as I've lost track of the subplots - actually resorting to a synopsis I found on the web to try to figure out what was going on!The last 50 pages were tremendous but it took perseverence to get there.Other authors that I enjoy, such as McCaffery, Modesitt and Goodkind, want to tell a story while Jordan seems more intent on confusing me with a myriad of subplots, similar names, and repetion."
5,Wonderful! Why should he stop at book 13?,"Lots of people has been complaining over Jordan's tendency to never stop writing The Wheel of Time. I say, that if the next books are half as good as this one, let him write 20 or why not 40 books. These books are _GREAT_. No other fantasy author that I've read (and I've read more than a few) is as skilled as Jordan.Latly he has been adding a little bit of 'soap opera' style to the series, true, but never to much and the intrigues are always credible and make sense. Personally I think that the series has gotten even better with the last few books of plotting and intriguing.This is the best book in the series."
2,Valandir,"The last three books have been frustrating. The trend continues, if Jordan is developing a style it is that of a shclock-pumping serial pulp writer. The first books got my attention, but now he has betrayed his former works and slipped into the role of the non-story teller. I hope the he gets with the program or we'll be better off watching Sienfeld reruns (same level of content, but at least its humorous)."
2,"Once again, an endurance test for Jordan fans!","Jordan fans must endure this only because we want to see how it finally ends. Readers new to this series, please, don't start it until Jordan proves that he can wrap it up in the next decade or so. Jordan's latest provides about 100 pages of real enjoyment, layered in 500 pages of filler. Jordan introduces/retains characters and sub-plots that provide little value-added to a once great story. He should take a lesson from George R.R. Martin and start killing off a few hundred main characters or so!With his latest installment, I found myself skipping/skimming entire chapters without missing a whiff of the real story.Let the buyer beware!"
3,Confusing the characters after so long,"I started reading the WoT series back in the beginning of June. I'm a fast reader and unfortunately, I didn't pay close attention to who was who. In the first books of the series, Jordan went over characters in each book, but in the last 3 or 4 books, he stopped. By the time I read Winter's Heart, my memory had gone fuzzy on some of the characters. I would recommend the University of Chicago's website because it has a WOT section that has an extensive list of characters and descriptions (if you have trouble, any search engine should find it). Overall, I think the first 5 books were the best because Jordan covered all the main characters about equally, but now each book seems to cover 1 or 2 extensively and basically leave everyone else out. I hope that Jordan gets the next book out soon because I'm anxious to see how the series ends, but not so fast that the book fails to live up to the previous books."
1,I am amazed at how high this book is rated!,I can't believe so many people actually like this book. Nothing happened in it. Well OK the story progressed a little tiny bit but for the most part everyone is in the same place they were when the story started.To me it seems like Jorden is milking a cash cow. He keeps writing books thinking we will keep buying them because we are hooked on the series. If the characters continued to make progress the series would eventually end. I don't think Jorden wants it to end so he has started to write books where very little progress is made!The reviews on book 10 are dreadful. I am done with the series. It is really a shame since the first several books were so good.
2,Discouraged,Volume eight and volume nine have moved the story along at a snails pace. One gets the feeling that the author and publisher are taking advantage of early volume success by stringing along the loyal readers who have been with them since volume one. It's discouraging to see Mr. Jordan going for quantity over quality and going the way of Tom Clanc and Stephen King.
3,"Getting better, but still not great","The series does recover somewhat from previous books due to this book, but not completely. Less slumber parties, but nevertheless more of the same old, same old. Characters are unidimensional, dialog is often infantile, overly verbose, repetetive descriptions, etc. Did anyone expect otherwise?I'll finish reading the series. Not because it's great, but because I'm one of those people who has to finish a story once started. I did experience some hesitation, however, because of the last book and after reading Jordan's claim (here on Amazon) that he's a better writer than Tolkien. Talk about cheek!"
2,Will he never end this story?,"I have read all the installments in the series. As the series progressed, (slowly,...very slowly) I have expected less and less from each installment. The latest installment is no different. The characters and plot lines are now spread so thin that they appear as cartoon cut-outs rather than characters with any depth. The pacing of the plot is so slow, and the books appear so infrequently that neither Mr. Jordan or myself are likely to be around to write/read about the final battle of good and evil. Save your money; if you have to read this book go the library or borrow it from a friend. It is no longer worth the price of admission."
5,Worth reading and re-reading,"Jordan has struck a balance of satisfaction and interest in the next installment. I was completely enthralled in this book. Anyone who has read the first 8 books that found this one lacking should re-read the whole series for what they may have missed. It was satisfying to see some of my suspicians play out (I was right - some of the time) and other times pleasantly suprizing to learn what Jordan has planned all along. The layering of the stories really exercise the brain.I am not only a fan of Robert Jordan, I also have great respect for Michael Kramer and Kate Reading who narrate the Un-Abridged audio books. I hope these two will continue to lend their talents for the rest of the series (unlike the constant switching of narrators with each Sword of Truth novel)."
5,Every book has been more exciting than the last!,"The plot has finally started moving again - storylines coming together, and characters reaching their potential! Fantastic book and well worth the read!"
2,Disappointing,Lack luster and full of annoying female characters that cover up their lack of whit with annoying bullying and brow beating. As a woman I even find this annoying... He doesn't have a single stron female character any more. Even those that started out so strongly have lost their power.
3,Better than the last book.,"This feels more ambitious, with quite a few significant things going on. ""Path of Daggers"" feels pretty small in comparison. I may actually see this series through to the end."
4,Rather disappointing,"Well... it seems that most of the reader doesn't matter how high they are rate the book agree that it is better them previous one. I'm not sure. There are even less major events then in POD, plot development is really slow. Just as in previous book only about half of expected events really took place. On the other side there few new characters in WH with the including long awaited Daughter of Nine Moons and one former damane. By the first look they are different from other women characters but first look could be deceptive. There is no solution for any riddles from previous books (murders, who is who and others). While the book becomes richer from its many subplots at least some of them must be resolved. The only relieve that this time Jordan didn't add anything new. This gives us hope that story finally will come to conclusion. Still despite all of this book definitely worth time to read. It's weaker comparing to the first books in the serial but it doesn't mean it weak."
2,Enough with the Fashion,"This is the last of this series to me. I feel ripped off. I just don't care what happens. I have stuck it out with Nine books. I cannot take it anymore...The story is still progressing too slowly, one or two significient events in each of the last few books and the rest filled with over emotional fluff. It's time to bring the group back together and march. As Corwin says ""Talk is cheap...Whiskey costs money""A real sore point with me is that I estimate that the number of words describing the frequent changes in attire of the female characters is enough to fill at least 2 of the 9 books to date.I also have no sense of the amount of time that has past. Is it months or years? Do we have a new L. Ron Hubbard in the making here.This is supposed to be Sword & Sorcery ??? No way would Tolkein write this way."
2,5 star poll,"for veryone who gave this book a 5 star rec: 1 quick assignment, please write a 1 paragraph bio of the 87 main characters, so the rest of us can appreciate it too..."
5,"I'm with you until the end, Robert.","To those who have read this book and written negative reviews I say one thing. The calm before the storm! How can any person, who understands high fantasy literature, criticise this book when it is enriched with characters and story telling, that have never been seen since Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings. The story is one that sets the scene for a major shift in the balance of light and dark. Finally we see the light take back its place in the true source. It is after this book that the forces of Light can make a major stand against the Dark. The final scene of this book is the best I have ever seen. Finally Rand will be able to smile again. There is now a chance of beating back the darkness the plagues the world. It's the calm before the Storm."
4,So Far.....,"So far, so good. I have enjoyed all the books to date, even though recently they have been a bit long winded, and even repetitive (for new readers I suppose). It has been a long time coming, and this one does seem to ""wrap up"" some questions that had lingered in my mind for a while. I have read many reviews of this series, and some are downright nasty. I do not share that opinion, and have to say it has been an overall good experience. There is alot of info to digest, but that makes the story more interesting to me. I have read several, what I would call ""pulp fantasy"" that are quick quasi-enjoyable reads, but really don't get you caught up in the characters lives as this does. Having said that....I think the publisher is dragging this out too long. There are still several plot resolutions to be made, and this book only gets us part way there."
3,Back in the day.....,"Ok we can all agree that this was by far a better book than the last two. I still lacked that something that the first five had that left me slavating for the next one. I don't think that it is a matter of the author being not haveing fresh material. His cast are all as complete as ever I just wish that the character set wouldn't change so. The author has lost a little focus over the last three books, yet I feel that it will get better. It can only get better. I beleive that the book ten will be the last....in this story."
2,Enough already!,"This is the book that Mr. Jordan finally lost me on. I faithfully slogged through the previous 8 overlong volumes, but I have finally had my fill.We could've gotten to this point in the story after 4-5 books, it certainly doesn't merit 9. Way too long, overly detailed, extreme lack of anything happening for at least a book or two. Was an editor assigned to this series, or does whatever he churns out make it into the final print?I particularly dread the sequences with the ""Forsaken"". Does anyone find these at all interesting or compelling?Another point-if you're going to have a series with about 5000 characters, please put a complete character index in each volume. I grew tired of reading a 30 page chapter on some character that hadn't appeared in the series for 5 volumes and not having the faintest idea of who exactly they were, and why I was supposed to care about them. Jeez."
5,"Where's a list of words for ""Great"" when you need one?","Firstly, I must say that if you do not believe that an enthralling political center combined with terribly realistic characters in a novel can bring together a story line just as well as a simple, ""Let's go smite evil...again..."" story line, then do not read these books! These are not your run-of-the-mill fantasy novels; they are filled wih intrigue and subtle twists that leave you filled with wonder and tingling with anticipation for the next page. Of course, there is always the omnipresent life-or-death struggle between good and evil that should fulfill all of those adventure-lovers' desires out there. Oh, and that British summary is horribly inaccurate; please remove it."
3,To many plots,"While the action is good and at least this book is making progress in the storyline there are simply to many charactors now and to many plots. Far to often I found myself asking ""Who the hell is this person and where did he/she come from."" Also they take up much of the book which leaves less room for the characters I actually care about, such as Matt, Perrin, Rand and Elayne. Each only has a few chapters in the book and the only one who accomplishes anything is Mat and Rand. I simply think Jordan needs to start killin off some of the needless characters he's created."
2,Master of the Irrelevant,"Just what I wanted over 200 pages dedicated to what Elayne wears and eats! Wow, Mat Cauthon finally finds himself back in the series...but his most enjoyable aspect, i.e., past military knowledge, isn't mentioned at all. Perrin gets about three feet along in the search for his kidnapped wife. The ""rebel"" army of Egwene doesn't even get three feet closer to the White Tower. Should I go on?Oh, the ""great climax."" It was only anticipated about 4 books ago. It certainly could have at least been made more interesting. How disappointing, Rand finally DOES something but the writing is so drawn out that you almost fail to notice it.Hire a REAL editor already. Jordan's wife certainly isn't cutting it at the job."
3,Loved it but...,You know I still love this series but can any one remind me of who's who? I don't think I remember half the characters from the first book anymore. Also I wonder if Jordan realizes that he doesn't need to bring every single kingdom of the world into the book. Yes I know he's building toward the final battle but honestly let's just have it out already!
1,Stop the pain!!,"What happened to this series?? How could such a fine story devolve into a major disappointment?I'll be the first to say how much I liked the first four books in the series; in fact I would rate them all at five stars. Since that time there has been a downward spiral (read plunge). For some reason the plot has stagnated, there has been no character develpment and nothing of import has happened in the last five books! The grand Aes Sedai sisterhood seems to spend their time bickering about petty, trivial matters, such as necklines and hemlines rather than serious threats to their existance.The characters have not matured in any respect, but neither has the story line.One theory we have among us is that Robert has actually passed away and someone has been trying to finish this series based on his notes they found lying about.This would not be such a disappointment if not for the promise of earlier books. Can the series be saved?? Let's hope Robert finds his stride."
2,getting worse,Thes books are getting worse and worse. The story in Winter's Heart just wandered around without getting anywhere. Even worse Jordan opened up new subplots without resolving any of the old ones!
1,Send this horse to pasture. Please.,"Out of the 766 pages of this book, less than 100 are worth reading. If you like over 600 pages of identical women trying to manipulate each other, while yanking on their braids, twirling their skirts, and turning a well-turned calf, this book is for you. If you like anything resembling the earlier books in this series (that's to say, anything resembling an interesting story), I suggest you skip to the very end of the book -- I certainly did.Normally, I hate abridged books -- I feel like they are an insult to the author's vision. However, if there is any book in the history of mankind that needs it, it's this one.To compare Jordan to Tolkien is like comparing a Harlequin Romance book to Homer's Odessey. Do yourself a favor and read a real Fantasy writer."
3,Middling,"This book really didn't live up to the expectations created by the unfortunately long wait loyal fans endured. Still, this really wasn't all that bad. The pace at least accelerates from the previous few, with some plot lines even moving somewhere (Perrin being excepted, and being the most notably neglected main character of late, even if Mat wasn't even in the last book). Still, it definately leaves more loose ends than it ties, causing a great sense of ""so what?"" and not the extremely satisfied and eager energy present from the early books."
1,Nine with no end in sight,"OK, so all Robert Jordan fans love the WOT series and want another nine books. All fine and good, but how about new readers? Would a new reader interested in reading Jordan's fantasy be so eager whe s/he finds it nine books and counting? People are put off from reading The Lord of the Rings because of its length and that's a mere 1,000 pages or so. WOT is what, 7,000??? And still no major developments judging from what I've been reading from these posts. To judge any better I'd have to read the book itself. No thanks."
2,Blah,"The problem with this this book and in fact the series can be boiled down to one character- Nyaneve. If I have to read once more about how she ""tugs on her braid with white knuckles."" I'm going to go crazy. It seems in the last few books, the only thing that women do is give each other ""cold stares and grimaces."" I used to love this series, but really, finish it up,I started reading this series almost half my life ago."
1,Very Poor,"WoT has become Waste of Time and Robert Jordan seems to be stringing these along for no other reason other than more books equals more $$. I struggled through even finishing this one. I'd suggest trying another author like Feist, Eddings, or George RR Martin."
2,If you have to...,"Look, I'm not going to trash this series. I've enjoyed it so far and I'm not angry. Just disapointed. Books one through seven have been great. Yeah, they lagged a little bit but they were great none-the-less. However, when book 8 kind of lagged, I became suspicious of treachery from Jordan. And with this book, I'm right. It seems like a soap opera now and since I saw the reviews for the 10th book, I don't think I want to finish the series unless it ends or something good happens. Oh, well. Maybe Jordan will get out of whatever 'funk' he's in and start writing stuff like he did before. (Or better) Anyways, if you must read this book then read like the last 100 pages or so to get the jist of it and then read the 11th book."
4,Speeding up the story to it's former pace,"With Winter's Heart the story finally get's some action going again after the dissapointingly slow book no eight, Path of Daggers. A lot of questions from previous books which were left unanswered in book eight got answered at last and a set of new conspiracies were cast off. How the auhtor is planning to bring this all together in the final book no ten will be interesting to see. Let's hope he will not fall into the ""Twin Peaks enclosure""-trap. (That is, things will be more and more complicated and weird until a totally meaningless ending is all there's left to finilize it all.)"
1,How NOT to make a game,"This has to be the worse game i've ever bought. The graffics are horrible. The controls make me wonder if this game was ever tested, and the lenght of the game...there is none. I finished this game in about 1 hour, 55 minutes of it getting use to the controls. In tournament mode, you surf on about 5 different waves and that's it. Other than that, there is a vs. screen, but why? DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!"
1,This has to be the worst game out for PS2.,This has to be the worst game out for PS2. Not even worth the 25 bucks I spent on it.
4,Surfing Reality,"Once again, Rockstar has instilled realistic gameplay into an arcade-style game. Being a surfer myself, I was amazed at the realism in the shape, motion, and characteristics of the waves, and how that was different with each size and location of a wave. I injured my knee over the summer and have been unable to surf for a few months now. This game has given me the closest feeling, even more so than riding a skateboard, to surfing that I have felt since the last time I stepped on my board. I would start playing and the next thing I knew, 3 hours went by. I just hope that, being a college student, it does not interfere with my studies."
1,Unbelievably Disappointing!,"Was thinking about buying this game, so I rented it. A TOTAL Waste of time. Controls are impossible. Counterintuative. Graphics are hardly PS2.PLEASE! Don't even rent this game."
1,Good looking game with horrid controls,"This game is very appealing visually, but it needs a rework of the control interface. The only way I was able to make any progress - and even minimal progress at that - was to hold the controller wrong (sideways, with the dPad at the top and the X/O/Tri/Square buttons at the bottom).I figured maybe I'm just not good at it...even though I'm usually pretty good at most games, at the very least after a lot of practice. So I let a few other people play - all different ages and levels of experience. Everyone agreed - stay away from this one!Now, if they fix the controls in a new H3O...I'll rent it and give it another shot!"
1,Surfing: H30 is a TERRIBLE GAME...,"The gameplay is Terrible... Controls are Terrible. Is it Rockstar that came out with this game? Didn't they also make Midnight Run? Well, SHAME ON THEM for putting out such a poor excuse for a game. This is THE WORST game I have ever played on the PS2... If you are still determined to get this game, or are suckered by the 5 star reviews, AT LEAST GO RENT IT... THAT WAY you waste less money. I would go through ALL the reasons why this game is bad, but I thought, Why not go through all the reasons the game is GOOD... MUCH shorter LIST... Ready for it? 1. NOTHING about this game is good.... Happy gaming..."
1,Worst Game EVER!!!,"We bought this game for our 7 year old, naturally we wanted to check it out too. It is quite possibly the worst game that I have ever played (even worse than PONG). It is extremely hard to get into. I do not recommend this game to anyone."
4,hmmmmm..............,"am i the only one who didn't get the little sufboard to put on your dualshock controller? And also does anybody know where i could buy the dang little thing, If so please write a review and tell me. thanks."
4,Why Did This Series Stop?,"I still have all four in the series and was sure I would enjoy many more in the future. Then the author disappeared and the series dried up. I occasionally search for a new effort but now know it's not going to happen. Have never found any reason (author dying, retiring etc) why the author stopped. Loved the protaganists and their give and take. From searching for the author I believe that the books were contract jobs and there was no Stan Cutter. Wish they would resurrect the series. All examples were A or A minius efforts."
4,Leave your ex behind. The Workhouse will help.,"The End of The Pier The Workhouse, I stole this off a friend at college because I could not stop playing Peacon, luckily for her, I returned it to her after buying it from Amazon. It gives me sheer pleasure to say that after leaving my boyfriend Peacon, gave me more pleasure than he ever did. It's funny that music can give you a high when you're feeling down. The rest of the album gave me optimism too. I love the moody tracks and the vocals add a new dimension also. They British, right ? I guess that's why they understand peoples emotions, not like my ex."
4,"I really like Mitchum Deodorant, and this was ...","I really like Mitchum Deodorant, and this was no exception. The best part is that it doesn't flake and look messy like some deodorants do. In the summer, when you don't always have sleeves on, this is important. The scent is a little odd, but overall I really liked the product. Also, this deodorant takes a little while to dry, so if you are always in a hurry, this might not be the best choice."
1,real samples?,Are these the real samples from the '94 revival cast? I've heard Audra McDonald lots of times and she's never sounded like this. It sounds like someone has hacked into all the samples of Julie Jordan songs and replaced them with a man singing in falsetto.
2,The blues part is good...only,"I don't love her voice, but the DVD have some good blues tunes, BUT, have some pop music that should be buried in the 80's. She bop? Girls Just Wanna Have Fun? Poor Musselwhite! I didn't like it."
4,An excellent overview of the potential of e-business,"This little book is filled with all of the good reasons why e-commerce is here to stay. By means of simple parable/storytelling, Brown demystifies the complexities of doing business on the internet. ""You don't need a weatherman to show which way the wind blow"" might be his motto.When a friend gave me the book, I thought it was a ""how-to"" book; it's not. But the theory presented here is compelling enough to have made this a worthy read."
4,Quite Good,"Not my favorite Marsh, but still very good. Nigel Bathgate (AKA Inspector Alleyn's ""Watson"") is simply a bored journalist looking for something to do on a rainy day. He spies the mysterious ""church"" across the street from him, sneaks in to a secret ceremony, and quite by accident, ends up witnessing a murder. Who does he call but his own favorite Scotland Yard detective, Roderick Alleyn. An interesting blend of spiritualism, money, drugs and murder."
5,Enter: The Conquering Chicken . . .fast and powerful,"Unfortunately, I had heard of the gits due to the tragic death of lead singer, mia zapata. I heard a few songs by the band and decided to buy Enter: The Conquering Chicken . . . it was probably one of my better purchases . . .raw, powerful, full of genuine punk attitude and feeling !!!!!! This is definely an album to buy if you want to rock out."
2,After using this product I've decided to stick ...,After using this product I've decided to stick with shaving. It was somewhat painful to remove the wax strips and I experienced some redness and irritation afterwards. Perhaps some of the other Nair products work better but this one's not for me.
4,Great Rap Artist - Great CD,"In my opinion, T-Bone is one of the best Christian rap artists. I have not heard all of the songs on The Boneyard Box Set; however, the tracks I have heard are excellent. I ordered this CD to get a feel for T-Bone's earlier rap style--not to mention plethora of songs on the disc(s). I gave the CD 4/5 stars based on the limited number of tracks I have listened too.Other favorite artists include:John Reuben, KJ-52, TobyMac, Gospel Gangstaz, and Grits (among others)."
4,Basic and valuable,"This toy is very basic, yet I found that it was extremely effective in teaching my son his shapes. You really cannot go wrong with a puzzle."
2,I liked it better than my 18-month old,"I bought this puzzle for my daughter when she was around 18 or 20-months old. I thought it would be great for her because it has large knobs for her to get ahold of easily, it has more shapes than just the standard square, circle and triangle, and there are pictures under the shapes. I think I liked it better than she did, because she figured out how to do the puzzle after 2 or 3 tries, than never played with it again! I've even tried to coax her by starting to play with it myself and asking her ""where is the diamond?"" but she says ""No mommy"" and pushes the puzzle away. Maybe I just missed the boat for her age group, but she now prefers mix & match-type puzzles."
4,Fun - but can get hurt,"This is a great puzzle. Its sturdy, peices fit well and the photos under it are great. My year old daugther points to them and tries to say the word.But she ahs gotten hurt on the peices - they have a big knob and while playing with another toy in the room - she fell on one of the knobs - it left a big bruise.Also, she wants to run with the peices in her mouth and if she were to fall it would cause a big hurt. This puzzle needs to either be supervised or given to an older child."
3,Not our favorite,"I love the looks of this puzzle, especially the large knobs for younger children. However, the pictures under the shapes are so weird, I don't think they help my daughter to understand the correspondence between the pieces and their places. A pentagonal house? The back of a kite for a diamond? For the intended age group, it would be better if the picture underneath was an exact match of the puzzle piece, as with the Small World Toys baby puzzles."
5,Definitely An Authentic and High-Quality Set of Cards,"For those skeptics out there, I assure you these are the real thing. I just received my set from Amazon and they are very good quality... very durable and coated in plastic to prevent damage. It says on the box they are from the maker of BICYCLE brand playing cards - a very well-known name brand.The 2 jokers included in the set give you a list of Iraqi Military Ranks and Arab titles as well as a few other bits of trivia. I was very satisfied with my purchase and the camouflage backing makes the set look even more interesting."
1,baby can't see out,"I bought this to keep sun out of my little ones eyes when we're out running. Not only do the tabs not stick, as any toddler would, she protested being behind a curtain during when she just wanted to see the world. Wouldn't you?!"
1,No wonder these are on clearance,"Of the five discs in the pack, two could not be recognized by my computer. The price may be right, but when I pay for five discs, I expect to get five functional discs. Now, do I go through the hassle of trying to return/exchange these? I think not. Memorex, you burned me this time, but never again."
1,terrible...,"I bought these on clearance (luckily for only $1!) and out of the 5 CDs, only 1 of them actually worked. (and it only worked for 2-3 rewrites).I'm avoiding Memorex from now on; I've also had a bunch of their CD-Rs just disintegrate for no apparent reason."
4,English tradition,"This is the typical English disaster story in its earliest stages. Think John Wyndham, John Christopher, J.G.Ballard -- maybe the average English sf writer is a total loner and what he's really writing is wish-fulfillment!.... This book does have a quality all its own, vaguely reminiscent of William Hope Hodgson and I enjoy the old-fashioned textures. If you're at all interested in the origins of the genre, this would reward you on that score alone."
5,A Must Read!,"A must-have for anyone who is curious or wants to learn about Native American culture and how we, as white men(or women) have changed and shaped their culture to suit ourselves. A wonderful inside look at the way things were, and in my opinion should still be. It will change your way of thinking about our past, and the future of this great nation."
2,Cheapens the Music,This album tries to use modern musical formats to present this ageless music. It doesn't work for me. It tends to cheapen the composer's work.
1,Be sure to wear your polyester bell-bottoms for this CD!,"You'll need your bell-bottoms to be in tune with this once-sacred music, now disco wannabe. I had heard Hildegard von Bingen on the radio (Spinner.com, actually) and was captivated! It was haunting ethereal music that transported me away from the mundane into a new sacred place.This CD, alas, takes me from my mundane (but sincere) existence into the hellish decadence of the disco dance hall. I've done the only decent thing and thrown the CD away."
1,Immature and disappointing,"I am a huge fan of many of the up and coming female writers and felt very disappointed with this new candidate. Her ideas are crystal clear and picturesque, but when it comes to execution, I found myself putting the book down more than picking it up. I believe in a few years Ashley may just hit it right."
2,Self-conscious literary drivel,"Yes, the author is young, and yes, she won the prestigiousHoughton Mifflin award, which made me all the moredisappointed with the novel. The characters are weakly drawn,the story wanders and meanders with no satisfying climax orending, and the protagonist is just too sophisticated (andpretentious) for her so-called 22 years. The author usedannoying literary devices to portray a supposedly-Southernvernacular (her incessant use of ""'round"" and ""'neath""quickly became tiresome), and it was quite obvious when shewas trying to make a ""point"" about the eccentricities of life.Her editor needs to tell her to ""get real."""
1,No James Joyce,This novel clearly illustrates Dunleavy is no Joyce. I hated it from beginning to end and could not recommend it to my worst enemy. Do not buy this book.
2,Should have listened to the other reviews...,"The suction on these bowls does not work on high chair trays. If you're looking for something to keep your little one from dumping the bowl on the floor, save your money; this is not what you want. They do work better than a regular bowl, when we're working on using a spoon or fork."
3,Only works on certain surfaces,"I have used these bowls at my parents' house and on their high chair it is a great product. At our home, they are sadly useless. Our high chair tray as a matte finish to it and the suction does not attach. Their high chair tray has a glossy finish. Think about the surface you want to use these most often with before you purchase them."
1,Not Worth Buying,"My husband bought these at a store, without reading online reviews. They don't suction well, the lids are hard to seal, and the Nuby bowls with lids are easier to store. Save your money."
2,"Decent, but nothing fancy","I like that these bowls have lids, it's great for storing food that wasn't finished. However, I must have had high expectations for the word ""suction"" because these failed greatly. The suction lasted about 3 times and then stopped all together. Nice bowls, just don't expect them to actually suction to the table/high chair tray."
2,The lids do not fit and take a huge amt of arm stregnth to close!!,These bowls are an absolute waste of money. I bought these from Target (wish I had read reviews at Amazon). I have hardly used them and now I am throwing them away. The suction does not work..my 8mth old can pull it out with one hand. The lids take a hug amt of strength to close the bowls.
3,Doesn't stay put anymore!,"We bought these for our toddler. At first they were great. They stuck to the highchair tray. After a few months a couple of the suctions lost its integrity and didn't stay stuck. We had a bad experience were my daughter tried to move it closer to her and as she pulled with all her might,it released and she ended up with warm cereal all over her face and chest. We can laugh about it now, but thank God it wasn't hot! Also, I've noticed that the plastic on the bottom of the inside of the bowl is starting to peel."
2,JUST SO SO,"ONE OF THE LID CANNOT COVER THE BOWL.THE SHAPE HAS SOME PROBLEM, SO IT CANNOT BE CLOSED. DUE TO LOCATION PROBLEM,IT CANNOT BE RETURNED BACK."
1,Awful and useless,"I bought these and then changed my mind. I tried to return them an Amazon told me to keep them because I was a valued customer. It turns out they are just such a piece of junk, they didn't want them back!The suction does not stay put at all. Like other reviewers hae said, you have to constantly push down on the bowl to keep it from sticking, which defeats the purpose of a suction cup bowl because then the baby thinks it's a game to get the bowl off the tray. I have to hover over my twins while they eat when they use these bowls, to keep things from going flying.Save your time and money. These are useless."
2,Not Worth the Money,"These are not worth the money. If you have little ones you know they like to walk around with their snacks. However, they do not know how to properly hold the container and eat at the same time. This leads to spilled food. The lids are detached, so there is no way to stop the spill or prevent it. Also, the lids are do not really secure the container. The suction does not stay on a tray or a table.Really, these are just small, nice looking tupperware."
3,It's an Okay Product,"The reason I bought this product is because of the suction functionality at the bottom. Although it's one of the strongest suction power cups that I've had, it's still not able to stay put. I am not a big fan of the bowl shape and diameter. the smallest bowl is a little too small to my liking. Also another cons is that the lid can be hard to close sometimes."
4,Love the suction bowls,"I actually have two identical sets of these bowls now - I purchased the first one just to try and loved them so much, so I got a second set. My daughter is 11 months and has transitioned to finger foods. Prior to these bowls I would just spread everything out on her high chair tray, but I wanted to introduce the concept of bowls/plates - however whenever I did the first thing she would do is grab it and tipp it up or throw it off the side! After using the suction bowls for over a month now, I can swap in a regular plate/bowl and she uses it like she is supposed to (yes...even in restaurants!). The middle sized one has a harder time keeping the suction than the others, but all in all you won't be sorry you got these!"
3,"Not bad, but suction good be better","I like these bowls, but the suction could stand to be a bit stronger. Even when moistened, the suction still gives way after a few tugs... at least it doesn't fly right off though I suppose."
2,Cute but not functional,"I tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed. The suction won't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table. On the kitchen counter top(formica) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal.I am returning mine to the store today. Dissapointing.BUT, they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature."
3,"great quality, but over-rated.","Wishing I wouldn't have purchased these. For the same price I could have purchased more regular bowls. The suction cups DO NOT stay put on any surface I have tried. The first time I brought these up, I left the highchair for 10 seconds to get myself a drink while I was feeding my son, and looked over to see him holding the bowl. And he was only 5 months old, so he didn't have a lot of strength!! They are microwave and dishwasher safe, are very durable, and the lids stay on quite well, but don't buy them for the suction cups..."
1,Don't suction at all,"Bought these so one of my daycare boys would stop dumping his food/plate on the floor - Suction didn't work right out of the package(washed first of course). They stuck for about 10 seconds but then he was tossing it on the floor. Very disappointed and glad I didn't open the other 2 packages of them I bought. They will be returned as they don't do what they say they'll do(Suction and stop messes). Cute colors but not worth the money if you are looking for something that will stick to the highchair,table, countertop. Yup tried a variety of different surfaces and still unstuck in about 10 seconds without anyone pulling at it."
3,Nice....,These bowls do stick well and helps keep the baby from knocking the bowl off the highchair.
3,use these all the time,great storage for snacks and leftover dinner for kids. The suction cup is way too easy to pull off. my son figured that out in about 30 seconds. If you want this to stay put on the table it likely will not.
2,They will get thrown on the floor,"Don't know what to add that someone else hasn't said but, yeah.... if you have an infant that throws his food on the floor, these bowls will not help you. I just used them for the first time and my ten-month-old son just threw a bowl of cottage cheese on the floor. Wet or dry, they do not stick for long no matter what you do. They're cute, though and I like the lids. Time to mop the floor again."
5,SO COOL!,"I love this toy! I have not got this doll, but I have groovy girls. They came in a twin-pack and ever since i've loved them. You cannot brush their hair (Its wool)But you can sure style it!Here is my review about GG:The sassy funky girls, who love to be groovy, they long for adventure, fun, fashion and friends and are the hippiest chics in town! Angelique is groovy-licious and get da additional accessories for Miz angelique!Bye!"
5,Beautiful art and story,"Last night my husband and I explored with pleasure the lush, detailed collages that grace every colorful page of ""Love me Later."" This volume can be enjoyed by all ages, from tiny kids to adults. The simple story speaks volumes about family and life, and the exquisite art transports the viewer to a magical place. This is a wonderful companion volume to Julie Baer's first book, ""I only like what I like."""
5,The Best Poirot Mystery,"It is the Poirot Mystery I like best. There are few whodunits I want to read again, but this book is the exception. I read this book second time and I love it again. It is not only an excellent mystery, but also an excellent suspense story. The battle against the fiend who commits murders alphabetically is thrilling, fast-paced and highly enjoyable.Reading whodunits, I rarely feel sympathy for victims nor hatred to murderers. This book is the rare case. The murderer is really a cold-blooded fiend. Even affable Poirot expresses a cold rage to the murderer."
5,Clever twist,"If you are a fan of Agatha Christie's, as I am, you may think that you've read all of the clever plot twists that there are, but this book has a real gem of a twist. Hercule Poirot begins to receive letters that predict future murders which occur in alphabetical order with regard to the victim and the town. Poirot uses his friend Hastings, the narrator of this book, as a sounding board and begins to try out his theories on him. While the official inspectors are carried away by ""evidence"" which they discover, Poirot tries to use his ""little grey cells"" to deduce the identity of the killer. This is a definite ""must read"" for Christie fans."
4,"predictable ending, but good read","agatha christie ventures into somewhat uncharted territory - the this time, poirot is on the trail of a homicidal maniac. Christie fans will see the ending coming. the characters are a bit bland. Poirot comes up with the solution, but in the end any number of other solutions could have been equally plausible, so it is not clear why he went with this particular one.Still, it is an Agatha Christie book, so even when it is bad, it is good."
4,A great artisan of mystery,"Hercule Poirot, the famous detective, receives letters which warn of a coming murder. The towns and last-names of the assasined are arranged in alphabetical order. First, a merchant, then a maid, and then an archaeologist, are killed. This is exactly the kind of book one should not spoil by revealing much of the plot. Suffice it to say that it is smartly built. The characters are well-rounded, and the threads of the plot lead through the mystery until ends meet at the end. Good entertainment."
4,Good rope but not really in sections,"I was looking for a 2 section rope that would allow me to use for skiing and shorten slightly for wake boarding. This rope just has the handle on a very short section, so we can't really shorten it at all. Its a perfectly good rope though and has a great grip."
5,John Bayless is awesome,"He's such a great talent, I was lucky enough to meet him almost 2 years ago. I got this CD autographed! :) He was such a nice person and performed so well on the stage. Buy this album, it's really awesome!"
5,Neil Bruce is God,Professor Neil Bruce balances economic theory with real-world examples and applications. His graphs and mathematics are explained thoroughly and the text covers both expenditure policy as well as tax policy; making the textbook good for 2 seperate courses/semesters.
5,The best,"Ratey makes clear that the an individual's brain is under continuous development from conception to death, and is affected by influences on the mother, such as smoking, before conception. The brain has many parts which work together in changing combinations to perform various functions. The book has many diagrams explaining these facts. Many similarities of other animals to humans are explained. Also, how the brain affects behavior and is affected by it. It is also made clear that the story is still being written by researchers around the world. The reader is challenged to absorb this densely-packed information."
4,Norpro taco rack,"This is the best taco rack for the price. I don't like the rubber coating on the handles because I put it in the oven to crisp up the taco shells. But I set the oven at 225 and the low heat doesn't bother the rubber and the shells come out nice and crispy. I had to bend the handle in slightly to fit in my oven. All in all, it's a great buy. I would've given it 5 stars were it a little shorter and no rubber."
5,Another winner,A charming story of selflessness told in a way that my 4 year understands the message.
1,Heartburn free,I tried two packages of this and did not get any heartburn relief What I did get was burping concentrated orange flavor. Fore it did not help but tried it on a recommendation from a person who swore.by it
5,Relief!,"Seven months ago, I bought this for my mother, who has extreme heartburn and hasn't found any relief using prescribed medicines. This has worked wonderfully! At first, she tried taking it as suggested - taking one softgel a day for 10 days - but found this to be too strong for her system (which is extremely sensitive). So, now she uses it whenever symptoms start to appear and it has consistently stopped the pain and other symptoms! She is also finding that symptoms don't show up nearly as often. This is such good news."
3,"Good, Reflective Film",I really enjoyed this movie. The whole story starts off a bit slow and I wasn't really sure where it was going. It slowly began to revele itself as a beautiful reflective film. I also really enjoyed Justin Kirk's performance. He brought some much needed humor to this movie that deals with some heavy subject matter. There were also some beautiful shots of the Hudson River (although the shots of him swimming in the river got kinda boring after the first few). Good movie I would definitely recommend to people.
1,She should stick to techno,"Serious classical music fans will no doubt be disappointed with the quality of playing on this CD. While Mae seems to have carved out a niche market for herself with her electronically-enhanced versions of some classical pieces, she is not a wonderful classical artist: this is made obvious with her attempt to join the mainstream classical community. While she demonstrates decent technique, there are a countless number of other musicians who play Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and Bruch better than she does, with much better phrasing and tone quality. (Any senior student at Julliard or Curtis would sound better than she does.)It would be silly to compare Mae's Brahms and Beethoven with the thoughtful, beautiful renditions that Zukerman has recorded, likewise the Bach and Bruch of Heifetz is in a completely different leagues than Mae's. If you like Mae stick to her other work, if you like Brahms, Beethoven, Bach, and Bruch, stick to bona fide classical artists."
4,Underrated Album!,"1988's Blow Up Your Video is along with 1985's Fly On The Wall and 1983's Flick Of The Switch one of the forgotten album of Brian Johnson era AC/DC. It is an album which takes a few listens to to appreciate beyond the first two tracks. The standout tracks on the album are Heatseeker, That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll, Go Zone, Kissin' Dynamite, Nick Of Time, and This Means War. The overall sound quality has also been improved on the reissue. On the original, Cliff Williams' bass was very low in the mix, and it is more audible here. This album is not as strong as some other Johnson era albums: Back in Black, For Those About To Rock, or The Razor's Edge, but it is still a very good album with strong songs. It also contains some of Angus Young's most underrated lead guitar work."
1,Is this AC/DC ??,"The worst AC/DC album ever. It's even worst than "" FLY ON THE WALL "". When they release the band catalogue, this album is almost forgotten. What went wrong ? SImply, the songs are bad, everything sounds rusty and ninspired. Maybe Malcolm and Angus realized that, and after this drummer Simon Wright left the band, replaced by bald-headed Chris Slade."
4,A perky thrill,"A fun, uplifting collection of music that makes you wish you really knew Yiddish. Full of ""Oy, Oy, Oy""'s (what else do you expect with klezmer?). And full of spirit."
2,Zeppelin's Worst Album,"Don't buy this one unless you already own all the other Zeppelin recordings, and just want to complete your collection.While this *IS* Zeppelin's worst, there's still some interesting music on here that's worth a listen. Nothing really grabs you or takes you along for an interesting ride, though."
4,actually not bad...despite all the negs here!,"I found this CD in the remainders bin locally and gave it a listen today. Of course, I'd already read the reviews here and, as a long-time Zep fan who prefers their early work, I thought this might be a bust. Not so! I actually like this album quite a lot! Although I'll be skipping Bonzo's Montreux (a little too MUCH drumming for my taste), the rest are rockers from the old school of Zep. Plant's voice is still superior and listen to Jimmy take his guitar to task. Bluesy rockin' stuff!"
1,"Yuck,no thanks","All these songs are violently average with bad singing-but hey, it's Led Zeppelin,what else did you expect?"
3,The lost recordings,"Everything Zepplin did was worth a listen. I bought this one just to ""fill out"" my collection. I'm glad I had all the other classics first. This is at the bottom of the list as far as Zepp goes."
2,is this band a very good band of all time???,"hallO! I got a question for ya all,..is this band the best band of all time?? with the last testament of their CODA album? To be honest, ZEPPELIN seemed to be without having any inspiration anymore, by releasing the last CODA album. The only one tracks I have loved, are only BONZO's Montreaux and the new version of I can't quit ya baby. The other tracks on this cd are part of major musically taste..... Sometimes I dunno understand! why some fanatical said that they are the best band of all time?? if they were the best one,....logically means that their last album must have been very very good! not like this Poor CODA....."
2,Not much of interest,"Okay, I will admit to liking Poor Tom, Bonzo's whatever (it sure beats Moby Dick!) and Wearing and Tearing, but other than that this is a collection of outtakes that should've stayed outtakes. Low points include We're Gonna Groove, the live I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album. If you're obsessed with the band, I guess this would be good for you. But the best version of Coda is in the aforementioned $100 boxed set."
1,"horrible, don't waste your time or money.","This album is awful; even worse than presence. Seriously, I'm not even going to waste my time reviewing it it's THAT bad. If I could give it zero stars I would."
3,Postumously released outtakes,"Released in 1982, two years after the band disbanded, 'Coda' (1982) has only one truly indispensible track, a 1970 rehearsal version of ""I Can't Quit You Babe"" (originally from the first record). Also included is a well-executed cover tune (""We're Gonna Groove""), an unremarkable drum solo (""Bonzo's Montreaux""), an outtake from Led Zeppelin III (""Poor Tom""), an outtake from 'Houses of the Holy' (""Darlene""), and three outtakes from their last record, the most interesting of which is the punkish ""Wearing and Tearing"". Bottom line: this should be the last addition to your collection."
4,"Again , A Venture Into T.r..A..n..C..e","After Ian Van Dahl, its goin to be JAN WAYNE to TRANCE the world. My favourite is TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART & BECAUSE THE NIGHT(remix) & they are amazingly wonderful. If you are a trance fan, I guarantee that you will like it."
3,Useful when it works,"I have long experience with this product and its earlier versions. It's wonderful when it works, but it's tempremental and Symantec charges $30 for the privilege if telling you ""we don't support that"" and ""you can't do that"". Their ""free"" tech support time lasts about 9 seconds (60 days?), then they charge you to be unhelpful.It accounts for 80% of the crashes and reboots in my Windows 98 Peer to peer network. If there was any competing product, I'd be using it"
1,Worse Live Album in the last 15 years,"I normally Love live cds, so when I bought this, I was so hopefull it would catch Robbie's talent as a live performer,it didn't. Sure its got all his hits, but Live albums are suppose to recapture the feeling you get from going to a concert. Like Garth Brooks's Double Live did so well in 1998.Way to much studio work was done on this album from Robbie,Ifthe idea was to make a perfect album well it failed because liveconcerts arent suppose to be perfect.The only highlight of this album was Let me entertain you, whichhe does in concerts but not on this album."
5,Its all about Menedez......,"Menedez killed their parents! For their fourteen mil! If I ever met them! I would have them killed!Menedez Menedez I really hate menedez menedez menedez, I would have them killed!The best cd I ever heard in my life!"
5,An Excellent Resource For Learning To Program The 8051,"This is a must have for anyone learning to program and understand the 8051. This book follows Myke's usual well written and very informative without all the technical overkill format. There are ample ""real world examples"" and plenty of information on items such as programmers. If you have not purchased the book you are missing out. For all the Robotics fans it is also extremely helpful..Take advantage of this book!!"
4,Very Good Introduction,"I like the conversational manner with which the author treats his subject. I would have liked to see more time spent on the 8051 Instruction Set but perhaps the author assumed that the reader would use the databooks (if so, he should have stated this.) This book alone does not explain the Instruction Set sufficiently. The use of a simulator is a very good idea. However, be warned that if you want to keep using the UMPS simulator after the trial period you will have to pay $650.00! This is more than most users will want to spend. My first printing has lots of annoying typos. I sincerely hope that subsequent printings will fix these. I noted 70 to 80 typos and errors."
1,Horrible,This is a horrible product. It leaves your glasses greasy and DOES NOT clean them at all. The shipping is slow as well. Do not buy this product. It's a waste of money.
3,The movie is fantastic but the quality of the DVD is poor and very dark.,The movie was great but the quality of the DVD is poor. The picture is very dark and the color is poor.
1,Waste of time,"It was so awful that I had to watch half of it in fastforward. Although supposedly a period piece, it couldn't get itself out of the 1960s. It felt like a bad skit from saturday night live. Poor acting, unconvincing story line, flat characters, etc. I am truly amazed that this film won an oscar. Unbelievable."
5,funniest movie ever,"We saw this when it first came out. It was, and remains, one of the funniest movies ever. A classic among adult themed movies but without overt nudity or sex."
3,Office of Readings is incomplete,"This one volume edition of the Liturgy of the Hours has everything you need to celebrate morning and evening prayer (Lauds and Vespers) and night prayer (Compline). While it has a few selections from the Office of Readings (Matins) it does not have the complete office for the whole year. This is why the previous reviewer did not know what to do with the non biblical writings; these are mere fragments of Matins. If you want to celebrate Matins, you'll need the four volume set.Since the Office of Readings is my favorite hour, I was disappointed with this edition, especially since it became redundant once I bought the 4 volume set."
5,Just go buy one.,"It' small , light , will save your main battery and let you shoot fast. It will greatly improve the pictures you are taking now. Only the front panel adjusts. They never show pictures of that. And that's fine. About as easy to use as they come. No point in making any comparisons. Just go buy one."
2,Returned it the same day,"I bought this flash mainly for hand-help use for strobing while light painting during long exposure night photography. It wasn't very good quality, so I returned it."
5,This is a very versatile flash accessory for any NIKON DSLR.,"Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, This is a very versatile flash accessory for any NIKON DSLR. I used this on my D40 &D5000. Last long on two AA BATTERIES, GREAT BUY!"
5,Perfect Speedlight,"Perfect little speed light. Wasn't sure about this product before ordering, given the price and that it is the cheapest of the Nikon Speedlights. But my other options were purchasing a product that I couldn't afford, or trying to use a 30+ year old one, and praying that its compatible with my D3000 and doesn't fry anything. That being said this product is amazing.Flash is super bright, and being able to angle the flash has been an extremely helpful feature. Batteries last forever in it, I carry 1 set of spares because I know if they die on me, that other set is all I need to keep going for the foreseeable future.Overall this is a great little product for the price, I know it lacks alot of features vs more expensive flashes, but for what you pay for, its 10x better than the build in flash."
2,"Skip this one, at least get a SB-600","This is at best a built in flash substitute but it even fails at that since the built in flash in D80, D90, D200, D300, D700 etc. can be used for the built in commander mode which this doesn't. Speaking of commander mode, you can't use this as a remote flash. You also don't get an LCD screen on this model so there is no flash compensation. Power is lacking, and you can't bounce this the way you can with the higher end models.Save up and at least get an SB-600."
1,Nikon Flash,If you have a built in Nikon flash already on your camera- this does NOT flash any brighter or better. Do not buy. Spend your money on a larger more powerful flash.
5,Worthy Flash,"This product is great as any Nikon flash. Takes in 2 AA batteries and provide a battery life. The tilt angle gives a edge with the inbuilt flash as well as saves my camera battery while using flash. Recharges quite instantly was a surprise. All the indoor area is covered wuite well. The only drawback that i feel is the side tilts, if provided would be a complete flash."
4,It is good enough,Not so strong light but it is good enough for me. I expect cheaper price (about $80)
3,Awesome little flash!,"I used the Nikon SB-400 flash to shoot pictures for a wedding and both the day pictures and the night pictures were great. The two double AA batteries lasted a long time. I used the diffuser which spreads the light evenly, but not harshly.I would rate this higher, but I thought the price was too high. If the price of the flash had been 90 bucks or so, I would have bought two flashes!"
5,"For users with a Nikon with ittl only ""D40""","This add-on flash is compact and works flawlessly on Nikon camera with iTTl systems. Using the built-in camera flash will consume your cameras' battery life a lot faster this possible causing you to lose that perfect moment. There are huge benefits of bounce over compared to the direct flash on the Nikon model and body you own, maybe overwhelming. This unit gets great reviews for its size and its multi angel bounce, this unit will bounce off high ceilings and distant walls but it's great for many occasions and engagements.Overall by using this unit instead of the built-in flash of one's camera, you will get more shots from the camera since its power source is two independent AA batteries and not the camera. It's compact it's great for its size ability and price."
5,fantastic flash,"if you have a D40, this is the perfect flash for you. i take a lot of pictures of my kids indoor and the photos taken with the flash is just miles away for the built-in flash. when i use this flash you wouldn't think that it was taken on a dimly lit room. btw, i always point the bulb up to bounce. this flash is just GREAT! i highly recommend it!"
5,Excellent flash for the $,"This flash is an excellent flash for the money. I can't believe how much better all of my pictures are when I use this flash. I had used the flash that was on my camera, but this lights up my photographs."
5,Great little flash,Chose it as it would work with my Nikon D5100 camera and its ability for bounce lighting indoors. Nice small design that will ont overwhelm the camera.
3,hmm...,"Um... for the record: All the Beatle songs other than those composed by George Harrison or Ringo Starr were credited to ""Lennon-McCartney"" or ""John Lennon and Paul McCartney"" by prior agreement of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, whether they actually collaborated (as they did in many cases) or one of them worked by himself.John Lennon wrote Ticket To Ride, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, A Hard Day's Night, and You've Got To Hide Your Love Away.Paul McCartney wrote Yesterday, Here, There, And Everywhere, Fool On The Hill, Penny Lane, Hey Jude, and The Long And Winding Road.John Lennon and Paul McCartney collaborated on Eleanor Rigby, She's Leaving Home, and Michelle."
5,"Two Wakefields, Two Evil Twins","Some may say this and #100 is farfetched. I think not! SVH is so much like the real world! There are wackos and maniacs. It was so unbelievable how Margo could have survived the last New Years. I was sure Jess couldn't have died in it, but the suspense was exilerating! I just couldn't believe it when I saw it! Margo and her OWN twin. I thought return of Margo was weird how she stayed and hid. I think Kate William is a great author for dreaming up this great plot! I mean, it would take me forever to think of a plot like she did and I'm a writer also! This deserves a 100 stars...Go SWEET VALLEY!!!!!!!"
3,Biograpphy or Dictionary?,"In many ways an admirable book and Holroyd writes with elegance, knowledge and wit. He, however, follows the recent trend in biography by feeling it necessary to retail every tiny tidbit he has discovered about John. Long letters are printed, for example, when the relevant information could be capsulized in five words. The reader is finally distracted by the sheer volume of inconsequential material and the overwhelming feeling that the author doesn't believe that the reader can follow where he is going without constant, constant reinforcement. The book edges toward a sixth grade account of the summer at camp in which logical development is snowed under and beautiful writing obscured by detail."
1,don't judge a book by it's cover,"I've heard friends say Fabio should make a movie out of his books, yet this will not be the one. The characters are flat, and the villians have no complexity behind them at all. I knew from the begining how it would end, and that is not romance. Really disappointing work."
3,good bang for the buck,"I have this, been using it as a hobbiest that is NOT real serious about it. IT works OK. The real cheap ones were just junk, but this one works ok. Met other guys with ones that work REALLY well, but they are over a grand. That's creazy. I only go out a few times a year. PS get headphones... really."
3,Love those Tuchuks!,"I feel this book was the best book of the series, the plot line was wonderful, a small mixture of mystery involved in the task Tarl had to complete.However- yet again we see how very Weak our Hero is when faced with women. He strives so very hard to be a good ""Gorean"" male- and always seems to fail in some small respect.This book spurred the creation of a LARP group- the TUCHUX's which sometimes come out to SCA events. a very good read, and ties in nicely with books much loater in the series.If you read only One Gor Book- this sould be it!"
1,Sorry.. This doesn't work for my phone !!!!!!!,I got this for Nokia 6350. It didn't work for my phone. Not sure if it will work with any other phone jack of 2.5mm. Sorry..
1,Headphones adaptor,"Well here we go again, multiple words to review an item that takes three word, does not fit what it was made for period"
1,Does not work for Treo,"As noted by other reviewers, this plug does not work as might be expected for phones with mic+speaker connectors. Audio out of one channel only."
2,DOES WHAT ITS SUPPOSE TO DO,DOES WHAT ITS SUPPOSE TO DO BUT IF YOU MOVE THE CORD WHILE UR USING IT IT MAKES A CRACKLING SOUND...NOT REALLY ALL THAT SATISFYED
3,adapter,"I ordered this because my phone, for some unknown reason, had this type and size of connection, instead of the standard 3.5mm. Its okay but you have to ""jiggle"" it to make it work. You have to push it in or pull it out in order to get the correct stereo sound through you ear buds. I was disappointed."
4,Good but not perfect,"Unlike what some people are complaining about, I got the item that was pictured. It also works as advertised for my LG Cosmos. There's only one problem I have with this adapter: the connection is finicky. Sometimes if I twist the plug on my phones jack, I can hear the sound go rather quiet. So, either the jack on my phone is bad or the wiring in the adapter isn't the greatest. Regardless, it was only a little over a dollar and still works pretty well so I'm not really complaining."
3,Good but doesn't fit well.,"The adaptor is exactly as it shows, but the socket does not fit well with my headphone.When I put the plug in the socket, it goes all the way down and snaps but the headphone stays mono, so I have to pull it out a little bit to get it stereo.As I walk with it, some time goes back to mono and I have to pull it out again for it to be stereo."
1,Not great and failed fast,I wish i checked my mail sooner. I found this same product at the 99cent store 4 for 99cents. Either way only a few bucks wasted on this product. It was as described but this one stopped working after a few hours of music (melted kinda). Cheap Chinese wiring. The sound wasn't that great when it did work.
2,Does NOT work for LG Env3,"This item will NOT work with the LG Env3. You get sound through one speaker. Do NOT buy this for that phone. I've looked all over for one that does, and turns out, the one I bought at The Shack works. Cost a bit more, but it's the one you want for this phone. Of course, the sellers sell this for a penny, and higher shipping, so you won't return it. Guess I'm stuck with a paper weight."
1,deceptive product description,"When I first tried this adapter, I thought maybe I'd come back and see that it was actually listed as a ""mono"" adapter. Wrong. It says ""stereo"" twice in the description, so why does it only work through one channel?Cheap, but shipping makes it not worth the disappointment."
1,cheap item. not happy with.,bought for 99c. shipped for 5.00. seller will refund my money less shipping. i have to ship back on my own. slick seller. and item is not as it looks either.
4,Meets expectations,"These adapters fully met my expectations. They were very cheap, so I wasn't expecting first-rate construction, but they work fine. Most importantly, they are as pictured, with a short length of wire connecting the male and female ends. I was worried, by some previous reviews, that they would actually arrive as a single molded piece, without the flexible wire; this would not have worked for my needs."
3,Nice sound but no sound thru left earplug,I bought this for my EnV3 phone. The sound only comes out of one side whether I have plug in my ears or have it hooked up in the car.
5,Family History,"If you are a person looking for your family history from Ritchie County, West Virginia you will be amazed how fun this book is to read. Miss Lowther writes in a style that is very compeling She has an amazing way to tell about the births , marriages , deaths without sounding repetive. It makes you want to look for evidence of your own family as one of the pioneers of this county. The amazing part is that she wrote from a wheel chair because of an accident from a spirited poney in her twenties. It took her eight years to write this book. I know these things since I am the great, great niece of the author."
4,Too expensive for its size,Item looks exactly as pictured.To my opinion it is too expensive for its size though.
1,DONT BUY,"BOUGHT FOR SON 3 1/2 YEAR OLD,THE GLOVES ARE SO BIG FOR HIM,THEY FIT AN ADULT,ONLY ONE GLOVE MAKES THE NOISE,(A BEEPING NOISE)VERY MISLEADING,WASTE OF MONEY ,SPEND YOUR (...) ON SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD."
3,Good album,"Basically, what you would expect from Fu Manchu. Heavy riffs and laid back grooves. Has a pretty cool laid back, dreamy instrumental on it. No real curveballs on this record. Just straight up Fu Manchu the way we like it. Kind of reminds me of King of the Road in sound. The reason I give it 3 stars is because it didn't blow me away but I have no regrets about buying it. The Fu machine just keeps chuggin' along!"
1,does not work,The connector does not work properly - can hear but cannot be heard. Only due to its low and high shipping costs I did not return the item.
1,Rip off---- Over charge shipping,I order one from eforcity. The adaptor is very fragile and beware of the shipping charge. it is there main source of profit. Not a very honest seller.
1,Deceiving picture of a different item!,Besides the fact that I received a completely different item than what the picture led me to believe I was going to receive - this adapter does not even work properly with my Sony Ericsson K800i !Will return or request a refund!
1,There are other things you can spend your money on...,"like charity. This item was a complete waste of money. I purchased it to watch movies on my SonyEricsson Equinox and not have to carry around two pairs of earphones. When I used it I could only hear the background music with no dialog. If you don't mind risking the price of shipping, it might work for you. Otherwise you should just steer clear of this product."
2,cheap,"works as an adapter, but fails at everything else.it feels like it's going to rip if i pull the cord too hard. not able to use it during a call unless your headphones have a line-in mic, and it sticks out of the phone quite far and is pretty uncomfortable in the pocket."
1,Poor quality,This adapter made poor connection with the phone. Only worked when pressed into the phone port but lost connection when pressure was removed.
3,"Works great, until it breaks","It works perfectly for my K790a. Even though I've owned it for about two years, I haven't had to use it that much. But, for the last 3 weeks, I've been using it constantly. Plugging and unplugging at least 4 times a day.I guess it's my fault that one of the plastic prongs broke and now I have to buy a new one.The adaptor will serve you will if you treat it well."
1,BAD PRODUCT,this does not work for headset. i thought it did. It is so flimsy. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS
2,Not exactly,"Not a perfect fit even though I double checked (2004 Grand Prix). I took out the old one which seemed better quality overall. When I tried to put in new one it was just about a half inch too wide. Took it out and compared to old filter and it was actually about 3/8"" wider. I ended up bending it to fit and that caused some pleats in the middle to pinch and expand. I rarely review my purchases, but I hate returning stuff so I will live with this filter, but it fails in both fit and finish compared to the old one."

4,I Remember Albert,"I had the rare privilege and honor to have been stationed with Albert Ayler with the 76th U.S. Army Band in Orleans, France, from June, 1959, to June, 1961. We performed together many times, but he was so far ahead of other musicians, that his style was not readily acceptable. He did perform the standard repetoire of the Army Band, but on nights and weekends he did manage to play with many of the local French musicians, and was readily accepted. His untimely death left the world with a void that will never be replaced."
5,This is Amazing,Camilo Sesto gives an incredible performance. You can feel his pain and agony in Getsemaní. You can also feel the sweetness in his voice in Hosanna. This is a great buy. A great mixture of everything that makes music beautiful.
4,Versus' best album,"All the Versus albums contain true gems, but The Stars Are Insane is perhaps their best, most consistent effort and serves as a wonderful introduction to the band for newbies. It is clear, tight, melodic, powerful, punchy, honest, sensitive, lyrical, melancholic, hopeful, clever, inventive, and an inspired sonic gem. Indie rockers and indie poppers alike love this band, much as they do a group like The Pixies. If you dig it, I suggest picking up Dead Leaves next, and then branch out to the other entries in the Versus catalog."
5,you have to beleive!,"i was first introduced to the ouija board at a friend's party. it was the coolest thing that had ever happened to me! it didn't work for some of the kids as well as it did for me i think because they didn't beleive in spirits; i've believed in spirits all my life. after the party, i asked my friend if i could barrow it, and she did. my other friend came over and we found out lots of things that we hadn't known before. this is definately not a game, and children 10 years and younger should not use it!!!!!!!! my cousin used one before about 4 years ago. he asked if there would be any major tragedy in the future, where and when. it replied: ""on september 11, 2001, new york will be on fire!"" i have many other reasons to believe in the ouija board. my advice to you before you get a ouija board is that if you have a friend that has one, try it out first, or most importantly, know if you believe in spirits!!!!!!!!***"
1,Sort Of Hokey,"I used an original one when I was a kid, but haven't since, because it goes against my personal faith. But that is beside the point. I bought this glow-in-the-dark board as a prop for a short film, thinking it would be something different and kind of spooky for the camera. Instead, it came across more like a toy, sort of a cheaper version of the real thing--not the exact effect I was looking for, so I ended up not using it for the film and tossing it in the trash."
5,Ouija,"This bored is an exelent way to comunicate with the spirts. This bored is not a game but a way to use your sixth sence. Once you start the spirits are forever with you. So make sure that you want to be forever untied with the deadly spirits before you uae it. NOT PLAY! SOme spirits are harmful while some are gentle. Make sure that you are friends with some gentle ones so that if you come in contact with a disturbed one they can drive it out. This is the best thing ever. It's fun and spooky. BUY IT NOW. I use mine daily because I love talking with my ghostly friend, Jasmine Ferhinders."
1,Eh,"This is not a game, if you really do it.It is not spirits either, its evil demons that lie to impersonate spirits. I guess that for the ouja board to work, you must be devoid of the holy spirit. Demons have been around and watching everything for a long time, they know past events and can easily impersonate ""a spirit"". It is not necessarily safe."
1,Junky Buy,I have played this game many times and all I have learned is that it dosen't work! Well it does move... only because our fingers start to move after waiting 2-5 minutes!!! So the only thing I can tell you is don't buy it. I have it and have not played it since the day I bought it.
1,Evil,"This board is an absolute evil. My cousin asked on a stormy day to the Ouija board if something bad would happen. The board responded ""This could very well be."" The kitchen then set fire (and no one was in there.) The Ouija boards are evil and must be destroyed."
1,BEWARE!!! THIS IS NOT A GAME!!!!!,"Beware parents, do NOT let your children buy this game. In fact, don't let anyone buy this game!!! This game is an occult device and all that you talk to are demons and not 'deceased ones'.As soon as I played one, it opened pocherguiest in my home which took forever to get rid of, after some prayer services I got rid of them. Also I knew a few that have had marks where demons gained legal ground to their bodies through the Ouija hurt them!!DO NOT LET YOUR KID BUY THIS BECAUSE HE/SHE WILL PUT HIM/HERSELF IN DANGER OF BEING EXPOSED PHYSICALLY TO THE DEMONIC REALM!!!!THIS DEVICE IS THE SAME AS LETTING YOUR CHILD PLAY WITH A REAL GUN!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,soft pop porn,"I watched this movie with two people who consider it a comedy classic and was ""udderly"" bored. The acting was horrible, the plot was boring, and the comedy was very thin indeed. Watch this if you must on mute. The scenery is great and if you like to see old geezers fumbling young half nude girls, this one's for you."
2,The CD is damaged,"I bought 3 cds from amazon and was happy that I received them days earlier and excited to listen to all of them, the first one I opened was Passion. To my great disappointment, when I played this recording, half of the tracks sounded like the cd was scratched. Tried it on to other players and it's the same, while the other two cds I bought with Passion seemed perfectly fine."
1,"Incredible No, Crisis Yes","First you dance, then you run. IC is a game fueled by curiosity, as long as you don't blow your top. You never know what will happen next. First, dance in a parappa the rappa style button pressing to the beat of music that is really off beat. This game is clearly a japanese game poorly made into an English version. The character Yano has to dance, I don't know why. Then a wrecking ball hits the building and you have to run from it. It is quite difficult but once you get the hang of it, you progress. If you like weird story type games, you'll like IC."
4,Hard to beat and Hard tp put down,This game is the definition of a button masher.It is hard. But if you stick with it you will berewarded. It is very unique and quirky and at abargain bin price you can't pass it up. Good Game
4,Very historic and quite useful!,"This is the first book I ever bought about Freemasonry, and gave me a peek into the ritual before I was a member. I petitioned as a direct result of this book, and used it to study for my proficiencies. Not only a beautiful book with wonderful illustration, but a fine source for Freemasons new and old!"
2,VERY POOR QUALITY,Having been in the Craft for over forty years this was not well done. It was jerky and hard to read and gave little new insights. The Book was flimbsy at best.
5,Burberry Touch,Our daughter got the Burberry Touch in Paris for my wife. I am very glad I found a place that has it.
5,Mommyof3,"LOVE the scent of this perfume and have had many people ask me what I'm wearing when I go out with this on. I decided to go with the bigger bottle because I had smelled the perfume in a department store prior to this purchase and new how much I loved it ahead of time. I use perfume *almost* every time I go out, so in hopes that it wouldn't run out fast...the bigger bottle was mandatory. GREAT purchase, and price!!"
2,"the advertisement is not clear, misguid the customer","I buy it but on the advertisement there is no indication that it was a tester,I should tell the customer if it is a tester, It make me made a mistake and I have to spend extra money to buy another one that was not a tester."
5,Buy it,"If you love High School Musical you would need to get this album. I love the deut with him and Vanessa it is such a beautiful song. Its worth buying because of that song. There's also ""Push It To The Limit""."
3,Good for its purpose,"If you can get past the author's endless name-dropping of celebrity clients and the Entertainment Weekly-like fawning over stars, you will find some helpful advice in this book for improving your speech. Good tips but a bit too, too L.A."
3,Shut Up and Dance.,"I'm one of the few people who didn't get into this movie. I like Kate Winslet (especially in ""Hideous Kinky"" and ""Titanic""), am not a fan of Jim Carrey. This film has it's moments, but gets too intricate and complex towards the end. If you suffer from dyslexia, for get about it! I aprreciated the cinematography, but the story, I could care less. Art house types probably drool over this film, I'm like eh,yeah uh huh................WHO CARES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Next please!"
2,Not worth Your Time,"It starts out interesting but soon turns to a sleeper. If you need to take out the trash, move your car or walk the dog, you'd be spending your time more wisely than watching this movie."
3,This is very hard to understand and articulate,"It just doesn't make any sense to me. It wasn't that interesting and you had to figure it all out when you wanted to watch itand not figure something out. I don't know if it was that good in theaters because it wasn't long before it came out. The Grinch is better. You'll just have to see what you think. The thing that made no sense was everything that went on inside of Joel's mind. This is very dramatic but if you do like drama, find out if you like it or not. It's all up to you."
5,Incredible,"Incredible movie! This movie makes you think, and makes you feel. A wonderful mix of humor and hurt. You'll still be thinking about this weeks later."
4,Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it.,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliant film. Jim Carrey is almost unrecognizable as the quiet, shy Joel and Kate Winslet is fantastic as the stereotypical free-spirit crazy love interest.Charlie Kauffman is an amazing writer and this film will make you rethink relationships and how we deal with them.Without pain, how can we really experience pleasure?Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it (a concept much clearer in the original screenplay which differs from the movie significantly). But its a fun watch, and the end is just lovely... Don't want to spoil it for you, so go watch it!"
5,One of the best,One of the best in it's genre if not the best. It leaves you with actual feels and new ideas and opinions. Check it out.
3,Boring.... but unique,"After an hour I wanted to scream, ""OK I GOT IT ALREADY, NOW WHERE'S THE MOVIE???""... The 'erasing' procedure goes on and on and on. So the movie boils down to ""boy gets girl, girl 'erases' boy, boy agrees to 'erase' girl, boy changes his mind in mid-erase, etc."" I was hoping there would be more of a story. Instead, it's mainly about the erasing with some ""relationship insights"" mixed in. The positive aspect of the movie is the unique camera work and effects. Too bad that couldn't have been harnessed for a real story like James Joyce's Ulysses."
5,"5, only because you don't rate higher.............","i had no intention of buying this dvd when i went for aladdin, and fahrenheit 9/11. after reading all these great reviews from dvd folks like myself, i was drawn to it, got it watched it asap after i got home. and was whoa just whats going on here?! i was confused but somewhat moved. today i popped it in my system, and aahh now i see where the whole thing was coming from right from the start! mr. kaufman you are genius, sir! no less brilliant, however, are jim carrey and kate winslet in the lead roles and truly the best of their careers to date! the superlative supporting cast, ms. dunst, mr. ruffalo, mr. wood, and tom wilkinson all played their parts so realistically, today i was glued to the screen. it is a masterpiece so beautifully constructed it's rather hard to explain. in short, i love this film-it owns me now, so thanks dear fellow dvd people here-i am grateful."
5,BRILLIANT - I'll never get tired of it.,"This movie is brilliantly made. The cinematography is truly beautiful, and the story is extraordinarily original.Watch it over and over to discover details such as the color of her hair as a mechanism keeping track of time.My favorite thing about this movie is that it portrays realistically (unlike so much media) that love is not perfect happily ever after.Way to go to Jim Carrey for proving that he can make quality movies with complicated parts... beyond just The Truman Show."
4,"Little Weird, But Good","This was a little weird, but good. You might have to force yourself to get through the first 15 or 20 minutes, but then things pick up and fall into place. It is a little like ""Memento"" and others of that genre. Not too predictable. Carrey is at one of his finest points, which surprised me. Questionable for dates, but good movie for (stable) couples."
3,Great Premise/Hollywood Ending,"I had great hopes for this film and have rewritten it at least 20 times in my head. It starts out great. It develops some believable off-beat characters with real problems. It gives Carey a chance to do some dramatic acting and he's good. Unfortunately it then begins to slide into the land of chocolate coated romance.In the beginning, when the romantic trouble starts that will lead to each seeking erasure, its at least partly because Kate's character has more than a bit of a problem with alcohol. In the end she is suddenly healed and all the loose ends of the relationship are swept under the rug in a typical, ""I love you and it will conquer all"" ending. The film would have been much better if the characters had kept some of their edgy, quirkiness resulting in a less certain ending."
3,WACKINESS PAYS OFF,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is pure Charlie-Kauffmen-Wackiness.If you liked ""Being John Malkovich"", you will appreciate this story about a boyfriend and girlfriend (Carrey and Winslet) who have each other erased from their memories at a somewhat slimy memory-erasing clinic. The bulk of the movie takes place in Carrey's head, as he learns he really needs his girlfriend through the process of memories being taken away from him.The camera switches from memory to memory as memories get destroyed and Carrey tries to drag Clementine (Winslet) to a place in his mind where the doctors can't erase it.I would recommend this as a VHS or DVD rental, or catch it at the theatre while you still can.It's not a masterpiece, but it does get you thinking."
2,Jim Carey in drama?,"What's up with Jim Carey and weird dramatic roles? We love you Jim, but only in comedies! He's a great actor but it's almost as if he's trying way too hard. I have to give him credit for effort, most people can't play the lead in Me, Myself, and Irene and be able to do this movie.This flick was just plain odd. I found it similar to the recent Adam Sandler drama movie-the one with the dramatic color effects. So thumbs up for Jim Carey in comedy and thumbs way down in this role."
1,You wont get it,This is a just a bad movie that people like because they want to seem deep or get it dont waste your time with this
2,Overrated.,(...)I'm so sick of people telling me about how great this film is. Everybody in this film sucked big time. Hollywood jerks acting. I hate actors acting. Especially Hollywood actors acting. I was hoping this would be something that would really make me change my mind about the actors in this film. It only confirmed my views on them.Halfway trough this film I figured out what would happen in the end (I swear I never read the book). I was hoping I would be wrong so my time wasn't wasted. Sadly I wasn't wrong. The second half of this film was filler leading up to the obvious ending.This movie sucked. A great story ruined by Hollywood actors.
5,One of my favorites!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time! I saw this in the theater 3 times and own the DVD. Although it is an indie drama, I feel like everyone can enjoy this movie. The plot is very clever and not as strange as it sounds. It made me laugh, cry, and think--excellent. Underneath it all, the relationship is very true-to-life and reminds me of other indie love stories likeOnceandTime and Tide. If you are interested in a thoughtful, funny, and touching movie, you should see this!"
5,wonderful film,"i am a huge fan of Eternal Sunshine's writter, Charlie Kaufman. he has a mind unlike any other. Even the most difficult and depressing parts of his scripts are combined with a great since of humor, which make the film bitter-sweet.in this film Charlie has been greater than in his other films, if it is at all possible.he combined his sarcasm and wittiness with a sensitive, beautiful, romance story. the result is an absolutly beautiful film. touching and brilliant. a must see movie."
4,great movie,"i enjoyed this movie...it makes you think about fate and what is meant to be will ultimately happen, no matter what you do to try to change it. jim carrey and kate winslet work beautifully together."
1,When fast forward is just not fast enough!!!!!,"Jim Carrey has done some really bad movies and unfortunately this is not his worst.But it is bad enough to miss altogether.Acting bad, plot comes from the bottom of some plot barrel somewhere in a Hollywood junk yard.All it has going for it is the title....what a waste that is."
1,"Very, Very, Very Disppointed - Comedy - Bah!!!","I was very disappointed with this movie. I figured with Jim Carey in it, it would be funny. What was the story line? What was happening during the movie? Who rated this a funny, romatic, movie? It was not funny or romantic. I never laughed once. I wish I had read a review about this movie, then I never would have bought it. I do not recommend this movie, save your money. But then, out there, there may be someone that understands this movie. Please let people know. I will look forward to this review. Sorry about this review but you are supposed to be honest."
2,Vastly Overated,"I found this movie offensive, only occasionally funny, and not just a little bit depressing. Perhaps I'm too far removed from the zeitgeist to appreciate the emotional ties, the current ""language of love,"" and the easy jump in/jump out of relationships among modern couples. In years past, the young would extend more courtliness to whores than these people extend to each other. I thought this movie stunk. It's a shame too, since Jim Carrey, one of those ""Look at me, how outrageous I am"" clowns, acts almost human herein. And he does it well."
5,Lil Wham....,you might not be so angry and alienated if you actually sought out loving relationships. I don't mean to be moralizing but I am old enough to tell you been there and done that. Nothing compares to real love. Take it from someone probably old enough to be your mother.
3,5 stars for Kaufman -- the actors -- 1 for Chemistry,"Does anyone else think that this film was excellently written and crafted -- and even acted by both stars, but that the chemistry was just off? Either lead could have made this work without the other -- but they would have been very different -- and better -- films. Together? Not the best. Enjoyable, but overall a letdown."
2,Bleh,"The people who liked this probably liked it because of its suffocating sense of its own artiness, while completely overlooking the fact that there is not one likeable character in the movie. Just because a film is arty does not mean it is good (more often the reverse).This movie is pap. Unpleasant and unlikeable."
4,Better than I thought it would be....,"3.5 stars. Renting this despite the fact that my best friend hated this movie, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked this movie. Definitely more of a art-house sort of feature, I was nevertheless intrigued by this movie's premises, just a tad bit underwhelmed by the execution. I like Kate Winlet, but found her character kooky for kooky sake just a little under developed. Still, I agree that it is an orignal piece and a different spin on romantic comedies, even if in this case you don't quite connect with these people as a couple. Overall, it's worth your wild to take a look at this film."
5,Book two is even better than book one! (if that is possible),"Wonderfully imaginative use of Delica beads. These sculptedbeaded earrings are very unique. The author shows realimagination with the array of designs in this book. I wasinspired by what I could make with tiny glass cylinder beads.Picture patterns including the cutest clowns. A wide varietyof patterns, something for everyone."
2,shabby production,"Hard to believe E. Wharton had anything to do with this story. From the beginning I thought the womens costumes were not authentic, and the women playing the ""Buccaneers"" had character traits not in accordance with a woman of that time period. The language was more in tune with a woman from the 20th century. It was almost offensive. No woman from this time period would dress, or act in the way they did. Mrs. St George was ..well, just awful, just so overdone I don't know why they bothered to include her in the cast, except to put down women. If you look at the movie as a broad, overdone soap opera, well I guess they made the mark."
5,The Bachelorette Meets Jane Austen,"One of the most pleasurable shows I have ever watched. Beautiful 19th Century women, luxurious clothes, innocence lost, castles, young noblemen, horses, carriages, arranged marriages, insanity, love.Why is it so hard to come by? Why hasn't someone purchased it and split it up into 10 youtube chapters?Quality of youtube is no worse than iTunes, and it's free.Anyway, this is a must see, especially the first two episodes. When it starts to get hairy, then watch the happy first half of Gone with the Wind."
3,The Buccaneers,"I did not know it was a TV series. The movie was just that, bits of a series. The movie was just that,not a whole story. I was dissapointed."
1,Not impressed,I was not impressed with this movie. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing. It was advertised with The Inheritance and Pride and Prejudice so I thought it must be good. Nothing like either of those.
3,Genisoy Mint Bars,"Genisoy advertises on the box ""New and Improved"" and ""Better Taste and Texture"". My question is: According to who? I found the ""New and Improved"" lacking in ""Taste and Texture"" compared to the old formula. I wish Genisoy would make the Mint bar like they used to. Of course everyones taste is different."
3,Not as good as High/low!!!,"I think it is an OK CD, which gets better when you have heard it some times. But still I was a bit disappointed with it compared to the last CD. The song ""Amateur"" is good, and ""Robot"" also OK."
4,"EVEN MORE ""POPULAR""...","I love guitar bands. But let's talk realistic: the style has not improved. You can't go listen to this so called alternative rock waiting for a god's revelation. But, geezdamnchrist, Nada Surf's new release changes concepts and proves that you can be fresh even with the old trio bass-guitar-drums. The record is a gem, something between the irresponsable Weezer and the caotic Pavement, but with a sadness that remembers something from Beach Boys - ironic they call themselves Nada Surf. Well, forget ""Popular"", even with songs less dirty and noisy. Welcome to a new step in alternative rock. We needed this."
3,It's OK,"The recording process could have been better. The music sounds thin. The performance lacks spark. I'll keep the CD, too bothersome to return for credit."
4,Volum II of the classic pre-Guralnick Elvis bio,"I summed it up in my title: Peter Guralnick's Elvis books are the standard serious biographies now, but before those, Hopkins' were the best of the dozens of Elvis books out there. He had the proper perspective on the greatness of Elvis's music, the sadness and weirdness of the final years, and who contributed what along the way."
3,Um... what happened to Clean,"Okay I love the fact that I can now buy great natural products, but c'mon what is with all these natural product becoming so...I don't know? Um... useless. I buy exclusively natural and chemical free cosmetics and I'm finding it harder and harder to find products that are reasonably priced they actually work. This is a RINSE not a wash. It doesn't lather hardly at all, which doesn't bother me as long as it's getting me clean. I don't work in a garage or anything I'm not covered in motor oil or anything like that, I'm just washing off the days dirt. This gel doesn't wash anything off and frankly the smell is...weird. Not sure why someone would think this smelled like honey or mango. It smells like sour bananas. The first time I used it I had to wash off the gel with something else...lol I love Alba and I suggest their products regularly but this one is not great."
5,Absolutely great improv music,"Astounding work in the 'insect music' style of improvisation (as sometimes this type of 'jazz' is called). It seems as if all of these players decided to play their instruments as if they just don't want to play them as one would or should. Extended techniques abound. Rumbling, whooshing, farting, scraping...all of the sounds that you can (or can't) imagine that could be presented with these instruments are here. But it is not just a show of weird sounds. They are played to form a group, an overall sound if you wish. The interplay can get real busy or delicate, depending on the piece. Somehow it is always musical (not in the 'melodic' sense though).Really enjoyed this one for it's total focus and REALLY uncompromising style. Recommended to searchers of the unknown, fans of FMP records, King Übü Örchestrü, Radu Malfatti, etc."
5,beautiful detail,"there are many other similar statues to this one online.... i found this to be the most beautiful, well sculpted, best detailed piece of art !I own the Statue of David and the Hercules DiomedesSale!! Nude Hercules and Diomedes Statue (1550)...statue. This compliments my other 2 statues very nicely.They are all cast in the same bonded marble and I have them on display in my computer room.If you love Greek mythology and ancient male nudes, this is a must own and add to your collection... or a starter to a collection.You will love the detail on this piece !"
2,Erector sets aren't what they used to be,"I purchased this for a gift and was disappointed when I saw the plastic pieces and flimsy looking parts. After it was assembled some substitutions had to be made due to lack of parts. I would not purchase this set due to poor quality of parts, will not work with motor, and the high price. These sets also include 6 different pictures of what you can make but only include instructions for 4! The receiver wants to keep the gift against my advice. I will never buy any of the ""new"" erector sets from now on. I'll be looking for the original erector sets because the quality was there and you got what you paid for."
3,What happend?,"I am spoiled by the OLC - no denying that. I was curious to hear how the various cast members sounded. Joanna Ampil is great as Kim. Yes, she is not Lea Salonga but I felt she did a damned good job. She is now one of my favorites along with Lea and Mika Nishida. I am waiting/hoping for a recording of Mika Nishida singing the role. As for the guys in this compilation - one word sums it up, ""Yikes!"". Well, not all the guys, more specifically, Peter Cousens. What happened there? I cringed during ""Why God Why?"". My favorite to date is Greg Stone. The roles of the Engineer and Thuy were okay. As for Jon, I don't think I have the strength. I must agree that this set of CD's is a must for any MS fan."
2,"Get the Miss Saigon OLC, it's a better choice","Inspite some of the negative feedbacks or reviews that this CD has received, I decided against the odds and ordered it. Now, I guess I have to believe the reviews next time. Joanna's ""innocent"" and beautiful voice is comparable to and at times better than Lea Salonga's. But her duets with Chris and John are terribly executed. Chris and John's voices are not ""miscible"" with hers. They are ""shouting"" rather than singing, specially the Engineer, very irritating squeaky voice. While listening in disbelief, I suddenly utter that ""I could sing better than this guys"". IMHO, the only good thing about the CD is the included libretto and listening to it reminded me of the live show I saw in the Philippines featuring Lea Salonga and Cez Campos. To all my ""kabayans"", think thrice, not twice before buying this stuff. Get the OLC, it's a better choice."
2,A missed opportunity,"This recording could have been something special, as it follows in the mould of the Symphonic Les Miz from the same creators, but instread smacks of opportunism.Released to coincide with the Australian Premiere at the Capitol Theatre in 1995, it features two stars of that production as a marketing opportunity. Musically, however, Peter Cousens is every bit as unpreposessing as he was live: if only the recording had opted for the magnificent CoCoy Laurel, whose energy, talent and drop-dead brilliance endeared him to audiences as the Engineer in Sydney! Joanna Ampil, compelling as Kim, however, redeems the recording markedly.Ultimately, however, the CD sounds like it was recorded in a variety of bathrooms around the world and edited together: there is very little interraction between the cast, or a cohesiveness about the piece - which is sad given its scope and power to move, as demonstrated by the London Cast Recording."
2,Soy free?,"The ad for these CoQ10 softgels specifically says that they are soy free, which is why I putchased them. Unfortunately, it was only after getting them, opening them that I read the label which says they have soy as an ingredient. For someone who cannot have soy, this was a true eye opener. Never, ever go by what you read about a product listed on Amazon. Make sure to check the label."
2,"Sadly, this book droned On and On and On...","Whether it was the un inspiringly one-dimensional characters; the many boring mundane pages I gritted my teeth to get through; the mirror-mirror-on-the-wall theme I at first thought was clever but grew very tired of; the romance that came about so late in the book that I was indifferent to it; the same old, same old storyline back at castle MacKeltar (enough already! give us something fresh and new!); the weak barely there villain; the rushed bland ending; or the mention of the next two possible books that are going to be the exact same as this one...I just could not wait for this one to end."
2,Disappointed,"I bought The Highlander's Touch, The Dark Highlander, Spell of the Highlander and The Immortal Highlander based on the reviews these books received. Each book had basically the same plot...like a Harlequin romance book. I think I'll read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series again...at least it had a lot more substance."
5,Another Keltar Man Has Arrived,Jessica is a college student who has to meet delivery guys late at night at her professor's office to sign for a mysterious package. The package contains a large ancient mirror that actually is the prison of Cian Keltar. Jessica frees Cian from the mirror and they race against time trying to find a way to free Cian and destroy the dark sorceror who imprisoned him. If you are looking for a steamy read with a sexy highlander and a modern day woman then this is the author for you. This book and her last three are a must-read for any lover of scottish romance. The Keltar men have everything women desire in their hero.
4,Read her other books first,I loved this and I really like how the last 4 books characters are involved. If you love romance and romance set in Scottland you really need to read this series!! One of my all time favorite series!
2,disappointed,A die hard Diana Gabaldon fan I had high hope this author could deliver. Unfortunately she falls short. For me too much explicit sex and not enough detail and plot.
3,"Good Book, Sub-Par Kindle Format","After reading (and loving) the Fever series, I went back and read all of the Highlander books and for the most part, I wasn't disappointed. However, one thing that really detracted from this book was the formatting for Kindle.Unfortunately, Spell of the Highlander was full of misplaced italics...in fact, the majority of the book was written in italics, with intermittent and wrongly placed switching between italic and non-italic script. This is the only book in the series in which this occurred.The MacKeltar books all have very engaging storylines and characters, however the poor format prevented me from really getting into the story. As far as the actual plot went, I found the characters to be a little underdeveloped for Karen Moning's usual style, and the ending to be extremely rushed. That said, it was still a good book and a must-read for finishing out the MacKeltar books and contributing to some Fever series back story."
2,Disappointing read,"I eagerly awaited the publication of this book. Unfortunately, the plot is exactly the same as the previous books in this series. I was very surprised that Drustan and Dageus figured in the resolution of the story, again.Wait for the paperback."
1,So what,"Maestro Chomsky, it is called either we try our best to rule the world or we will be ruled by some other governmental point of view on how to control global resources."
4,good cdrw for price,i really enjoyed this burner the software could of been easier for a novice like me .but through trial and error i figured out.a good product and as always amazon delivered
5,"Great Music, Great Value","Cecil Taylor's music is not for everyone. Maybe that's why when the Cecil Taylor portion of ""Mixed"" was first issued back in the 60s, it was done so as a Gil Evans album! In any event, this is a great place to start if you want to check out Cecil's music, and you get another album's worth of material thrown in for free. The first three tracks of ""Mixed"" are Cecil's, with an all-star avant garde jazz lineup including Archie Shepp, Jimmy Lyons, Sunny Murray and Roswell Rudd. Speaking of Rudd, tracks 4-7 were originally released in the late 60s as his album ""Everywhere."" Anyone who enjoys exploratory jazz will find there is nothing mixed about this CD."
1,what's the fuss?,I couldn't believe how bad this CD was after all the good reviews. I listened to it three times from beginning to end waiting for something to happen. I plan to trade it in for credit at the local CD shop...
1,Poor quality vinyl for an excellent album,I have encountered similar issues to what has already been described. Extra noise and static (mainly on the b side). It is unfortunate because this is one of my favorite NY albums.This level of quality is absolutely unacceptable for modern vinyl. I hope this is limited to a few LPs.
4,Epic Tale- Not A Mystery,"Despite the claims of some of the misleading reviews (including the Editorial review at the top of this page) this is not a murder mystery in any way. Yes, two of the characters do perish, as is revealed in the first chapter of the novel (which is not in chronological order with the rest), but this plays an absolutely minimal role in the story. While the question of who ultimately perishes does linger in the back of your mind while Doig relates the multi-faceted story of the Duff family, this is not a tale of a family coping with death. This is truly an epic story which combines interesting, developed, and, most of all, distinct characters with an extraodinarily well described setting- an enormous New Deal project and accompanying lively shantytown set amidst grand natural scenery. The result is a novel which anyone (though especially someone with an interest in or affinity for the American West) should thoroughly enjoy."
5,Excellent work,"Bucking the Sun is an excellent work. Ivan Doig uses amazing description in his story of ""The first family of the Fort Peck Dam"". I highly recommend it to anyone."
3,Good but incomplete,"What can you say about a hose, it is maybe a little stiff but it works. The problem, it came with no fittings. As a novice at the airgun game I expected just to buy a hose and connect it straight up to the compressor and gun which I also purchased at the same time. Make sure when you buy a hose you order the fittings as well - that way you save an extra $6 on shipping and a lot of frustration. I wish someone had told me first."
4,CRAIG IS BACK AND HE'S BAD!!,"When I heard 'whats your flava'? I knew I would love this album!His first album 'born 2 do it' was off the hook,even my dad loves it(cringe). I just brought 'slicker than your average'and I haven't stopped playing it;all the tracks have their own sound,style,vibe, he manages to blend different types of music perfectly, the title track just hits you,its upbeat,catchy,and well writtten.Craig's voice and lyrics have matured but that just gives it that edge.I would definately reccomend this album to any and everyone.....go buy it now! CRAIG IS HOT! HE'S THE BEST OF BRITISH AND SHOULD BE PROUD!"
5,Slick Enough To Rewind,"We at CDSelectaFans.com and CraigDavidMedia.com have come to post our review of Craig's new smashingly amazing album, Slicker Than Your Average. After almost two solid years away from the UK to promote the smashing platinum plus album, Born To Do It (What is it now, like 7 Million albums?) Craig has return to take British music to the masses. Not often do you find a young artist with as much knowledge of the industry as Craig has. The songs on the album are amazingly written and produced by some of the best producers in the UK. Without one doubt in our mind, we can tell you this is on of the hottest albums of 2002/2003. Now it's your turn to choose, so tell me, What's Your Flava? Craig, or that plain old dull music.The Staff of CDSelectaFans.com and CraigDavidMedia.com"
5,"Craig does ""IT"" again... HOT ! ! !","I must admit this CD is so hot from beginning to end, no doubt about it. I had to warm up to his first CD ""Born to do it"" & at first I wasn't sure if he was born to do it, but I am very well pleased with this offering. It's hard to pick a favorite but if I must for now it would be ""Slicker than your average, followed by ""Personal & ""Rise & Fall. Craig David is now one of my favorite artist, because if he could come back like this, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this talented young man. He is the complete package & not some studio enhanced singer, like most of the so called artist of today. The more I listen to the CD the more I love it, it's filled with so many different emotions I can't help but love it. If you love REAL music then this CD is a MUST, you would be doing yourself an injustice if you don't buy this CD. LOVE it, LOVE it, LOVE it, & so will you. Happy Mykey..."
5,Craig David- Too slick 4 words!,"This is a must have for any RnB fan! Craig David shines through in this fantastic album. Everyone will love this, from your baby sister to your gran! The best track on the album has got to be Slicker than your Average. It's great for when you're chillin out, or when your getting ready for a hot date! The smoothest of RnB flava will shine through. If there is a worst track (doubt it!) it's probably Rise and Fall. I'm not gonna say anything bad 'bout i, though, because it's still pretty good! If RnB or even Garage is your thing, you've gotta get this album- it's HOT!"
5,illadelph's finest,"Best lyrics of any rap group period. most creative, thoughout rhymes that actually meant something, whether is was burning right wing conservatives, stomping dumb bigots, or simply blazing to start the day. ""No Goats, No Glory"" may not have been the ""theme album"" that their 1st - ""Tricks of The Shade"" was...but it was a better showcase of the band behind them, that made them the best live rap group I have ever seen. I grew up in Philly at the time when the Goats and the Roots were just breaking ground, and used to see them at clubs like Doc Watsons and the Trocadero, great period to be living in philly. Goats are still my favorite rap group, and they only made 2 albums. If you can find it...1 of the 2 MC's - MADD Max...released an album with his own band ""Incognegro"" - self titled album, it is my favorite rap album of all time. can't say enough about these guys. The Goats ARE hardcore rap.p.s. to the guy from Kansas City who gave this 1 star...your comments make no sense."
4,good book,I just started to read it but I find this book very clear and with many helpful exercises.
3,Average CD,Some pieces are terrific and some so-so. That's all I can say about this particular CD. I just love their music and thought I'd try this one....and it's not bad.
2,Dream theater is a great live band but. . .,"I really must say that I was let down, in lots of songs the guitar is just NOT loud enough, and the bass is just way off balance, James Labrie doesn't sing as passionately and as well as he usually does, he sounds exhausted, and some parts of this album are at a slower tempo so that sucks, this recording doesn't do their live sound or other recordings justice, I think the live at the marquee is a much better live sound, and it's also a better live sound than the tracks on the change of seasons album, u MUST get LIVE AT THE MARQUEE, it sounds so much better than this album."
4,Not your run of the mill Fantasy,Presents visuals that take some real thought. Not for the average fantasy reader. Real science hidden in the entire story.
2,Niven fan but....,Really enjoyed past books in the protector/ringworld universe but this is one book too far. I would rather have not read this mediocre mess.
2,Stop reading after Book 2,"The characters really just guess for the length of the book. There is no real development, and plausibility totally went out the window - which was such a strength of the original."
1,Don't buy it!,"This is one truly appalling book. If I could have given it zero stars I would have. Larry Niven was once an exciting writer whose excitement in novelties carried you along with him. Now he seems to be drearily trying to tie together the loose ends of most of his previous work, to little or no effect - just going through the motions.Where can I start? Lack of characterisation. Slack plotting (which Niven now seems to believe is purely mechanical). Ho-hum action sequences. Personal obsessions (inter-species sex). Here-and-there action to no great purpose. And a resolution which is wholly deus ex machina.Sad to see an author who once had it all together (and remember the younger Niven justifiably won both Hugo and Nebula awards) lose it to this extent. I ended ""Ringworlds's Chidren"" thinking it would have read a lot better had it been edited by E. E. (""Doc"") Smith - and that's saying something!"
3,"A light, quick read, if anything more like 2.5 stars","This is a quick read, and would be a reasonable end to the Ringworld stories. I downgrade it a bit for repetitiveness and for the ""deus ex machina"" quality of some of the devices employed.I think Niven is generally regarded as a ""hard"" sf writer, but after all, he employs, for example, psionics and various undefined ftl drives. This story features some fairly extreme examples of the liberty that using such fantasy elements allows for rather extreme events.But that's to some extent a side issue to my review. This book has much the same tone as the previous entry in the series, The Ringworld Throne, though I somehow liked that book better. In this book Niven continues to explore the ramifications of the struggle for control of the Ringworld and sheds a little more light on its history and fate, along with those of a number of characters."
1,Niven is worse than Lucas,"Thank you Larry Niven for raping my childhood. With his last to ""Ringworld"" books, he has destroyed my love of the first two. It's worse than what Lucas did to Star Wars (well...maybe not that bad). He breaks the rules of his Known Space universe at whim, provides inane characters who act without purpose, and the plot/story is just plain LAME. The worst part, however, is just trying to figure out what's going on from page to page. Niven has apparently lost the ability to describe what's in his imagination with the written word.Let's all just hope that Ringworld's Children is the last book in this series. I don't think I could take another one and still remain sane."
2,Book was WAY too lean!,"I was disappointed with this book. I've been reading SF (and Mr. Niven) since the late 1970s and I loved his earlier Known Space works but I found it difficult to read this novel.In a nutshell, this wasn't a book as much as it was an ""outline of a book"". I would have been SO much happier if Niven had filled his pages with more descriptions (much more description)... like, in every scene of the book! So many times I had to re-read a paragraph to ""guess"" what was going on or who was speaking. I realize there are a lot of characters in the story but that's no excuse.I liked the ideas in the book but ideas, alone, don't make for a good read.Sorry, Mr. Niven. I love your work but this one stunk."
2,A waste of my time.,This is not the Larry Niven we all know and love. The writing is unpolished and disjointed. This is truely a sad day in my fond memories of Larry Niven.
1,A misfire from Marie,"This album doesn't work because Marie Osmond is essentially a pop singer who records country-pop, not a genunie country singer. But the production is twangy and Marie sings in an affected twang that isn't very convincing. This was her first (and only) album with Jerry Crutchfield, who worked with Tanya Tucker. Listening to this disc, it sounds like he's recording Marie with Tanya's leftovers. Skip this one."
3,I hope their next album is better.,"Lamb is an acquired taste for most people, and it usually takes a while for their new material to grow on me. I've listened to ""Between Darkness and Wonder"" many times, though, and it still hasn't growing on me. This isn't a bad CD at all, but it's very different from the group's first three albums. Lamb's music seems to keep getting lighter and more mellow with each new album, and I prefer the earlier, peppier music...even ""What Sound"" seems a lot livelier than ""Darkness."" The CD is very Bjorkish, and I am not a fan of Bjork, so that's probably why I am not impressed."
5,A remarkable acheivement - Marraige of Jazz and Mahler,"This extraordinary performance will not be for everyone! Lovers of Mahler and/or avant-garde Jazz with open minds will be pleasantly astounded, however. Composed as the soundtrack for a new, otherwise silent film on the life of the great composer, this project emphasizes not only the emotional depths of his death-oriented songs, but also his Jewishness in a most startling, yet beautiful manner. As odd as this hybrid might sound...it works! Elements of Hip-Hop, Klezmer, ""Lounge,"" Country/Western, and raw experimentalism marry happily. One of the most interesting and original recordings of 1998. Each listening has left me deeply moved and intellectually thrilled. Uri Caine took a big risk...and pulled it off perfectly."
2,Too much vocals,"The music on this CD is fine except for the terrible vocals which ruin everything. Otherwise, it would have been a pleasant experience. Anyone who can ignore this major flaw, has more patience than I do."
3,Great article!,My download of this was a little hard to get. I love Dr. Shurden. Expensive for the length and difficulty in getting it.
2,Don't waste your time,"I was very disappointed by this book. The biggest problem is that the author does not build her case on anything more than supposition. there are almost no footnotes or references or anything to indicate that what she is saying is more than opinion of idea. There is no proof for anything she says and then she builds her case on the point that she didn't justify in the first place! Also, the text is far too flowery for nonfiction and written in a pompous style. Disappointing - Read Merlin's 'When God was a Woman' instead."
1,Want facts? Don't touch!,"I am an amateur interested in the world's religions, past and present. I like well written books on the subject based on ""facts"" which are included in references, (I want them not too dry or written by someone who thinks old religions are primitive and uncouth). I really hate books that are sold to me under the pretext of being scholarly when I would much rather enjoy a good fantasy where the author(s) are honest about their imagination. I really want to give this book the rating Aaaarrghh. And yes I am female."
5,Truth is stranger then fiction,"I watched the trial, had a hard time believing people could be that evil. This book delves into the inhumanity that men have for others. A great read, will worth the time, a witness to human brokenness."
3,Not the original,"One wonders why there was a need to re-do what was a very good product in the first place. It is now a much trimmer book, without some of the scenarios that were in the earlier edition, and with a combat system relying upon the same die roll, which makes armor even more useless than it was before. These are just two of the criticisms I have of the game, though for the most part it still evokes the Warhammer universe well. If you have the original, I would stick with it, and just get the latest scenario books. There just does not seem to be enough in this new edition to justify the revision."
3,Other Books,"A Fantasy role playing game from those whacky guys that made Warhammer 40K. As a consequence, this is much grimmer, nastier and dirtier than some of the fantasy roleplaying games out there, so if that is not your thing, and you want a more lighthearted high fantasy type of approach, then do not get this game, you likely will not enjoy it at all."
5,This is THE best album EVER!!!,"Taking Tiger Mountain is my favorite album in the world. It's lyrics are thought-provoking and intelligent. The music is eerie and ambient, and sometimes it truly ROCKS! I recommend it highly to everyone who loves music."
4,"A companion piece to ""Here Come the Warm Jets""","A little less humor, a little less texture. A little more pop/rock sensibility. ""Third Uncle"" is a standard today, and helped define the ""No Wave"" movement of the late 70's: rhythmic minimalism, guitar shrieks, and rattles. Complete with stream of consciousness lyrics that signify nothing."
1,"Eno is better when he doesn't try to write ""songs"".","All of Eno's albums up to ""Descreet Music"" sound like variations of John Cale's ""Vintage Violence"". I didn't really like ""vintage Violence"", but I keep it just so I can play it for people who think Brian Eno, Roxy Music, Frank Zappa, and all those stupid guys were original."
2,True to the title...........,"This is the fifth in the Lacy's Mail Order Bride series. The first two were great, and the third one good, but the following books have not met that standard.Ransom of Love is a good title for the story line of this book. They do a wonderful job of showing two different illustrations of how Christ has paid our ransom. The information on slavery was interesting and the hate and bigotry toward the slaves is unfortunately true. However, I found the book itself redundantly wordy and at times too simply written.I only recommend this book if you have read the others in the series. For those who haven't - read the others first so you can see the quality of work the Lacy's are better know for."
5,great,Looking forward to a great backpacking trip and this will make it like home and the trip a little better ....
5,just love the Nuala Anne books,"Andrew Greeley is a favorite author of mine and Nuala is one of my most favorite of his characters, so any book from this series is a win for me."
5,Have to own this series!,"Please catch the rest of my reviews on this series. Don't want to repeat myself except that if you love good mysteries and character development, these books are for you. Again, read in sequence."
5,My Favourite Book By Far!,"I love this book. My friend recommended it and i was hesitant at first because i'm not a huge fan of sweet valley high but i love historical fiction book. After reading this book I'd have to say it is my favourite book, all the stories of each generation are remarkable!!"
1,NO GOOD,"RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT, IT IS NOT WORTH THE PACKING MATERIAL IT WAS SHIPPED IN, DOES NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TOO DOING THE JOB, UNLESS YOU ARE FIXING BICYCLE TIRES.EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED ESPECIALLY COMING FROM NORTHERN TOOLS,"
5,Excelent toy,"I bought this for my kids remembering how much fun I had with the original mecano toys. Very sturdy, well made, it is difficult to assemble but that is exactly the point of this toy to spend hours developping skills and having fun. My kids love it (11 and 9 years). I have to help them out from time to time, an excellent excuse too spend quality time with them."
5,This is a wonderful rendention of some well-known chants,This is actually my third copy as I keep giving them away. I love this CD. The music and chanting are beautiful.
5,Divine,"One of my favorite CD's...to sprinkle all over my home as well as gifting it to friends. Raviji is truly Divine and George's participation, as well as George himself, is a gift from the Gods."
3,Focus,"From a musical perspective, this album is great and what you'd expect ( its a bit repetitive, and sorry since i am not naive when it comes to Ragas )From chants it has good and easy to listen to tracks ( Mrityunjaya my favorite ) but the point is that chants do not require music at all, so my only complaint with this album is that music was made louder in places than chants themselves, especially in vedic chanting tracks, where one can barely hear chants themselves. so it should have been named as Music or some thing else of India rather than chants ( that's a soft complaint btw, i enjoyed the album in any case =).RegardsVyas, Anirudh"
5,Perfact for peace of mind,"Pt. Ravi Shankar is already known for his supremacy in Sitar and in fusion music. This album is totally different as he 'captured' the sound which will take you very near to God. Indeed, this album is PERFACT for peace of mind."
3,"good for little girls, but. .","not good for 12 year olds! altho these are cute, they are boaring...........ZzZzZzZ"
4,This album kept it real (Ahead of its time),"Rodney O & Joe Cooley represented for LA wayy before 2pac and the so-called ""East Coast, West Coast"" beef. This album is a precusor to all of that! Buy this! They straight upstaged New York with this one!"
4,Good photo and history overview of Ruta 40,"If you're looking at this book then you probably already know that this legendary road along the western edge of Argentina runs from nearly the frontier with Bolivia to almost the Straits of Magellan. This book provides some excellent color photos of not only the road itself but some of the scenic locations not far from La 40, including the Patagonian glacier parks. Ruta 40 has already taken on the sort of mystique that many North Americans associated with US route 66. At times it is a nicely paved highway and in places days can go by without seeing a single vehicle. The captions are in both Spanish and English, and Mr Kirbus has been kind enough to answer a question I had about a specific situation in the northwestern part of the country - his email address was shown on the back cover. If you think you might want to take a trip to the places where Ruta 40 runs through the Argentine outback then this is the first book you should get ahold of."
3,"50% Great, 50% Awful","John Heider's translation is simple, direct and poignant.Dr. Waitley's interjections are inane, pointless and almost insultingly asinine.I have actually made a copy of the tape and edited out all of Dr. Denis' babbling. I just can't tell you how ridiculous and offensive this idiot is."
3,Great Bass player,"Music itself maybe lacking a little bit, but the display of playing ability by jeff Berlin is present throughout.Jeff is an awesome bass player. This CD has some jazz, funk, classical and rock compositions that shows Jeff's dexterity by playing every genre w/excellence."
2,You can be hot without spending money and time on this book!,"So, there is the usual stuff...it's alright to take time for yourself, you have to have the right attitude (I hope most Mom's know this already)...but I kind of find the premise of the book skewed and comical. The author says that size, race, and class don't matter.....yet on the cover is a figure like the trucker panels you see, only this one is of a woman with kids. Geez!"
5,Mother's of All Ages,"I am a new mommy, and I have been so lost in my kids life that I forgot my own!! this book is such an empowerment for Mother's of all ages!I love the writing style and how cute it is! I also just bought a Hot Mom's TSHIRT!!!this book is amazing-- when's the sequel coming out?"
1,Do Not Buy This Humidifier!!,"The first one I bought never put off any mist---returned it for another.I've had this one for 3 weeks now, and 90% of the time it leaks water from between the tank and base(the unit is always on a flat surface).I gave it 1 star because it does work fairly well and is ""silent"" as advertised.But unless you enjoy cleaning up water off the floor and don't mind the possibility of water damage to wherever you place this dehumidifier I mustrecommend DO NOT BUY!!"
5,The leading modern quartet in a superb program,"While it's understandably difficult to say which is the 'leading' quartet today, having heard most of the obvious suspects live, based on the breadth of their repertoire, technical excellence as a quartet and individual strengths as string players, I would say it's a tossup between this group and the Artemis. This is a truly exemplary program and performance which (hard to believe) sheds new light on this core repertoire."
1,Too small,"I was surprised at how small this charm was. The photo is very much enlarged and the dimensions are not mentioed. For the price, the piece should have been larger. The details are very nice but the size is wrong."
1,GE-DECT 6.0 - Stainless Steel,Phone ringer did not work. Very POOR documentation! Will be sending unit back.
1,It's wall mounted,"Yes, it is a wall mounted phone. Not a base station which attaches to the wall and sticks out 6 inches. That's the good part.The bad part is, within 6 months the the key pad wears out so you can't read it than the phone breaks.GE - DECT 6.0 - Stainless Steel Finish"
3,it's an OK phone,Nice looking phone. Accesing the menu is a little uncomfortable. No Keylights! a mayor dissapointment
5,miracle fuel,"I used this for two long, one-day bike rides, 200 and 300km. I didn't want the hassle of solid food for these events. For both rides, I finished strong, and never felt weak from lack of energy. I'll note that I'm a bit old, overweight and out of shape, but felt as strong as ever. On the first ride, I did experience some leg cramping, but for the second, I added an electrolyte, and that problem went away."
1,Just Did Not Get This One,"The characters seemed like they should be interesting, but I did not care about any of them. The plot was just a waste of my time. I really did not like this book, although I really wanted to; I chose this book as a selection in my book club! Two out of six in the club liked it though..."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, he had seen it on TV and wanted it. Couldn't find it anywhere so I purchased it from the manufacturer. This thing is a piece of junk. The little ""balls"", or whatever they are suppose to be do not get as high up in the air as they show on TV and the package. My son doesn't play with it. I was totally disappointed with it. I truely recommend not buying this toy, you will be throwing your money away."
5,"The Brides of Christmas, The Unexpected Guest","This was my favorite of the three stories. Very believable, but then I have a soft heart for romance expecially when it is slightly May-December love story. It made sense that he was wary of another marriage with the possibility of losing a beloved again. The romance and ultimate marriage. of Fawke de Burgh, Earl of Campion, and Joy was great that it inspired me to seek out the sons' stories as well and I was not disappointed. Within four years, 5 of the de Burghs were wed and their stories were lively. Enjoyable. Now I'm waiting for Reynald's story. I hope to learn how many children the Earl and Joy eventually have together. Can't wait."
1,Find a different ABC floor puzzle....,I am not recommending this floor puzzle because:1 - Alphabet Letters are 1 inch tall and they are not the dominant feature on the puzzle...not great for teaching the alphabet.2- Animals representing the alphabet letter(s) are obscure. Example: Norwhale for the letter N
4,Great item for teaching the alphabet,My 4 yr. old grandson who is a train enthusiast really enjoyed the puzzle. I do think there is a problem with the choice of pictures such as a G for goldfish. He kept saying G is for fish and several other symbols like that were confusing. I did like that they put upper and lower case letters on each piece. Good for getting a child interested in learning the alphabet.
2,Misspellings in spelling book!,"To my amazement, I noticed two misspellings in the first 12 pages of Spelling the Easy Way, finding ""remember"" spelled ""remeber"" on page 10, and ""yourself"" spelled ""yoursell"" on page 12. One sentence on page 12 ends without a period. I cannot take seriously a book designed to improve my spelling if it contains such glaring errors."
5,One of the most fascinating novels ever written,"In Platitudes, Trey Ellis transcends the typical genres andvernacular commonly associated with African-American literature.The evolution(s) of Earle and Dorothy provide a touching lookat the ""forgotten"" black youth. The characters are not theprogeny of sharecroppers or transplanted islanders, they aresimply part of middle class Black America. The hilariouscontrast between the writers blocked Dewayne and militantfeminist Ishee Iyam provides a valuable look into the past andfuture of African-American literature. A must read for anyonewho is tired of reading the same old slave autobiographies."
3,G-rated Language?,"For the most part, this is the same formula as the others and is fine for your children to watch on their own. But at one point the character of Andrea, dismayed by her non-athleticism remarks (...). Many say I'm old fashioned for considering this a swear word, but I have no desire to hear my 3 or 5 year old repeat that phrase."
4,Essential for two songs,"""Georgia's Book of Flowers"" and ""Margaret's Machine"" are fabulous songs, especially the former. The rest of the CD is solid, but the highlight songs will make your favorite playlist and stay there. Seek it out."
2,Needs work,"Multiple crashes, lost calendars, frequent network connectivity drops. 10.5.1 update didn't fix much for me. My recommendation would be to wait until 10.5.5+"
3,Upgrading is sometimes risky,I bought the family pack and upgraded two Mac Minis without a problem. Upgrading the G5 killed it. I had to take it into an Apple store to fix it. The good news is they fixed it and upgraded it for free. Love the Apple store. You won't get that level of support with Windows!
4,Nice Upgrade,"You may not use all of the new features, but Time Machine and the Mail upgrade make it worthwhile. Easy installation. If disk space is an issue, go to customize installation and omit the language options you do not need."
4,Nice upgrade from Tiger - few bugs though,"I did an upgrade from Tiger to Leopard without reformatting my drive. Though that's not always the most efficient way of doing things, everything went very smooth.The bugs I'm experiencing are specific to applications. If you are an InDesign CS3 user, be ready for some hang ups and crashes. Adobe and Apple are still working on this issue. Though there is one workaround for the ID CS3 crashes that has worked for me through research on this issue. Every time you open ID, just create a new blank document - then go about your business opening an existing file, etc. That seems to work for me - haven't had a crash since I started doing the ""new blank document"" trick.The only other bug I ran across is using my Epson Perfection 3200 Scanner through Photoshop CS3. It hangs up the first time - but when if I force quit Photoshop, and reopen it and perform the same task - all works fine. Other than that, I really enjoy all the new features of Leopard."
3,Back up first!,"I installed Leopard on two separate computers. Both times the install failed. I had to redo the installs and manually transfer user files and preferences. Once I cleaned things up, the OS has run without problems. However, be sure you have a complete back-up of your disk before starting. I used my back-ups for recovery of some user files lost when the original install failed."
3,"One makes it, and one breaks it.","Vanessa Mae's playing of the ""Butterfly Lovers"" Violin Concerto is talented--a very good performance. Her playing of her Fantasy on The Chinese opera ""Turandot,"" incorporating themes including the famous aria ""Nesse dorma,"" is equally good, not to mention the melodies of the great Puccini lend a hand. However, the last work that she plays, an overture from her celebration of the Reunification of Hong Kong and China is . . . annoying. The repetitive singing in the middle of a galloping rhythm sounds . . . Easternly cornball, and the music all jumbles together into a screeching mess. For Vanessa Mae fans, this is no doubt a collector's item, but to those who are not into her aesthetics and just want to hear the ""Butterfly Lovers"" Violin Concerto, or just Chinese music, Takako Nishizaki's violin will do more on the Marco Polo or Naxos label."
4,Look Past the Self-Promotion,"Truth or not, this book is a fun read. I bought it because I wanted to read a first-hand account of the Glanton Gang (after reading Cormac McCarthy's excellent ""Blood Meridian""). Although Chamberlain may fudge on details, I think readers can sift a pretty accurate portrait of the era from his writings."
5,Not bad at all!,"Though the Original B Cast of Company is legendary, this is recording will be a wonderful addition to anyone's Sondheim collection. In my humble opinion the original is somewhat disturbed by the constant reprises of the Bobby-Bubi theme and some unpleasant (but nevertheless interresting) spoken parts. In addition this recording features the wonderful Marry Me A Little. Get the OBC immediately, but don't hesitate to buy this one as well!"
5,ideas and informaton,"I like how this book not only tells you how to use humor in the classroom but why, and what to tell the principals when they ask. This book also tells you the different ways to use humor. I am not the red clown nose type teacher, and this book offered many ideas for me."
1,Does not perform the way it's advertised,"WAAAAAAAY underpowered and out of spec for what it is supposed to supply. I have this unit with 2' of head feet. According to Danner's spec sheet, it should flow 550gph at that head feet. That's 9.1 gals per minute. That's laughable. I filled a 5gal bucket with it in 2:40 which is about 115gph, less than a quarter of what it's supposed to flow.FAIL."
4,Cute,"This was such a cute book. My daughter loved it and carried it around with her everywhere she went. She called it her ""patch book."" The girl in the book who gets the patch is very creative and imaginative and active, so it fit my 4 year old well. I recommend it if you are having trouble getting your child to accept the patching."
5,"Funny, direct and honest insight into the human struggle","With all the war, hatred, religious intolerance, bigotry, gay bashing, right wing crap in the world today, this book is a refreshing and honest look at why we humans fail miserably to be happy, loving people. The author doesn't mince words, and can be downright hilarious at times, but that never detracts from the importance of what she is saying - stop looking for happiness outside of yourself and live and let live!Chapter titles are a hoot, based upon famous songs and phrases...great wordplay and clever use of structure and narrative. This writer rocks, and I will be looking for her next book in all the right places!!!"
4,"Great ""learn how to do puzzles"" puzzle","We stepped up to this puzzle after mastering the farm animals puzzle, which had fewer pieces and was relatively easy to assemble without looking to the box for help. The dinosaur puzzle, on the other hand, was great for teaching my almost-4 year-old the ins and outs of puzzle assembly.We start by looking at a piece and determining what it's a part of. (""This is someone's green neck. Who needs a green neck?"") Because the dinosaurs are all shades of browns and greens, we next match the piece to the box, then lay it in the appropriate spot. We're currently working on learning about ""corners"" and ""edges"".The construction is excellent, as with most LCI products. The pieces all fit snugly and unambiguously and are printed on durable, glossy stock..."
3,Large puzzle,"Came in time promised and in good condition. Well cut pieces fit together so that it doesn't easily wander apart, but comes apart when needed. Bright colors and large size makes it a favorite of small kids. Pieces are not as thick or as durable seeming as I would have expected. Hope edges do not peel and haven't so far."
4,Very beautiful colors,"My 5 year old grandson put half this puzzle together but needed to take a break because it was hard for him and a little frustrating. But it is a good puzzle and has nice big pieces the fit together perfectly, it just takes a tiny bit more patience thanmy grandson has at this time."
5,Rapid Car Charger to Sony Ericson K850i,"Excellent item , I like it , and very handily .Rapid Car Charger with IC Chip for AT&T; Sony Ericsson K850 K850i"
3,Not the best / No es el mejor,"This it is a light album, with no complications. Unfortunately, it turns out to be shallow when compared to previous 883 works, like ""La Dura Legge del Gol"" or ""La Donna, Il Sogno e Il Grande Incubo"", in which the songs go from worldly to spiritual in an almost imperceptible way. Good energy level provided by BELLA VERA and LA LUNGA ESTATE CALDISSIMA, in addition to the video files of both songs inserted in the CD. Excellent combination of Max Pezzali's voice with Syria's in ESSERE IN TE. The art is impeccable, the most novel thing being the booklet to which a shining UV layer has been applied in some areas, making it flashier. This isn't one of the best 883 albums, but still has some good things...."
1,Why does the cover show an apple,"There is no apple in the story of Snow White and Rose red, that picture shows a witches hand with and apple a completely different story. It kind of annoys me when things are just thrown together with little thought."
1,Give me Blackmore,"I am a very big supporter of Deep Purple and I buy everything for my collection, But this one I can do without, I feel like I wasted my money. Bolin is not Blackmore!"
3,not very impressive,"Definately not of R.L.Stine's good books,I mean sure you never knew really who the vampire was until the end,but you didn't know there it was supposed to be someone else's fault,you just assumed it was Kylie,so the story in the meantime was waiting to see who would win and if Billy would save the day AND also Stine didn't exacly make the vampires too scary,just that they could look like humans and sucked blood for a living.Brilliant!(It also resembled the first book)# *** ETOILE ***"
1,monster plot hole,"It amazes me that not a single previous reviewer noted the gaping hole in the logic of the plot that renders the entire reading excercise an utter waste of time (not mention the waste of money in purchasing the book).The hole is this: Did the Giordano parents ""look in"" on Amy when they returned home from their evening out? If so, and if she was asleep in bed, than the suspicion of Eric would be no greater than anyone else in town. If she was missing on their return home than Eric has some major explaining to do.Incredibly this issue was never addressed. It is beyond logic to me that neither Giordano parent would check on their 8 y.o. daughter upon returning home from a night out.Would you?"
3,quick but not especially enjoyable,"The twist at the end is nice, the sort of thing that would work well for a short story. But aside from that there wasn't much that makes this work at all remarkable. The characters weren't believable or full developed. Nor did they do many things that most of us would think to do in a situation like theirs. It's a readable enough book but not one that lingers or has any emotional impact, and given the subject, you'd think it would."
4,What a downer!,"This is not a happy little mystery where everybody lives happily every after. In Red Leaves, Thomas Cook shows the slow destruction of a family after a little girl is kidnapped while the family's teen-aged son is babysitting for her. From the suspicion that falls upon the teen aged son, to the exploration of the house of cards upon which the family is built, Cook thoroughly examines a family that is not what it seems to be on the surface.Although the book itself is of a depressing nature, it was also impossible to put down. It was very difficult to feel sympathy for Eric or his wife, Meredith, as they, themselves, question their own son's guilt or innocence. However, it was compelling in a sick sort of way. The ending was unexpected and, if anything, made the book even more depressing. Nevertheless, if you want to read a story of a family falling apart under the pressure of being wrapped up in a crime investigation, then read this book."
3,More of the same?,"In general terms this is okay. However, the Nemis is too similar to the tyrant (resident evil 1) and the Big Guy in the green coat (in resident evil 2). The overall advice is when you encounter the Nemis is RUN. The homage in the police station is fairly pointless. After seeing the black cop (from resident evil 2) and the same rooms (plus the same music) it seems a bit...well, useless I suppose."
2,Let these zombies rest in peace,"It's another chance to wander round shooting zombies, but anyone who has played either of the previous installments will see this as a dull rehash with absolutely nothing new to offer. Effectively little more than an add-on pack of extra environments for RE2. If only they'd combined those two games, they might just have made something half decent. Capcom should realise that these games aren't getting any better, and at the same time they're obviously getting more predictable and unoriginal. The time has come to stop making them. Still, we're talking about the company who were still making Street-Fighter games post 1993, so what can we expect..."
2,Win XP is a problem,It doesnt seem to work on XP but works fine on ME and below. I just Think it's too slow to change views and not a hard core FPS game. But good to waste time while not doing something important.
2,Good Book! BAD E-Publication!,"This is a great first book, however words are mis-spelled, in the wrong order, or just don't make sense. It is hard to read when you have to consistantly try to figure out the authors intent.With that said, I found the story and characters well writen and enjoyable. Kindle or the publisher should lower the cost or fix the problems."
4,A good read on a night in the hospital,As all the books written by Hickman and Weis I enjoyed it greatly. It took my mind off of the pain and everything else going on around me during the 24 hours I had to stay at the hospital after my surgery. At times when I couldn't read due to heavy eyelids I would listen to the audio book due to anticipation of what would be going with everyone in the story. I loved the book and need more.
3,"Oh where, oh where have the pages gone...","Well, it goes like this ~ I'm happily spending my afternoon reading until I get to page 292 where I notice that pages 293 thru 340 are missing and 40 pages of a different novel, The Measure and the Truth, by Douglas Niles had been inserted.At first I'm peeved and wondering how long it would take to get a 'corrected' book from Amazon. But being the impatient person I am, I decided not to ask for a new book and to just keep on reading knowing I could pick up the gist of the story as I went along.Missing pages or not, I enjoy reading anything Weis & Hickman write.I would have given more stars, but, well, there are the missing pages."
2,Garrison keillor,"I have been a big fan of Garrison for about 20 years. I loved his first works. This last one I purchased 'Lake Wobegon Loyalty Days has too much music and not enough story telling, which he does best.Patricia Corbari"
3,glad it wasn't for me,I bought this for my wife who likes Bobby Vinton. He's too soft for me. He has a nice voice & I remember all the tunes but i think he's another reason why man invented earphones.
2,Not reccomended for really low temperatures !,"I found this product to be less than desired. I am an avid hunter who hunts staying all night hidden (without moving for no less than six hours) waiting for my preys (mostly boars, hunted at night, with no more lights than the moon's).I was expecting some product that might keep my body's heat, something critical when you are completely still for hours, at 10F... perhaps this product will be OK for reigning temperatures no lower than 40/45F and keeping yourself in continuous activity, but for my intended use, it was quite disappointing ...Besides I found they don't last for long, since mine is already tearing after some mere five time I wore it !Under Armour is a much better option !"
5,Private-Eye with the Armenian Touch,"This series was the most violent on TV at the time they tell me.It seems tame today.But what it definitely is,is a top- class, action-packed crime show.Mike Connors is excellent as private_eye Joe Mannix with his secretary Peggy Fair played by Emmy winner Gail Fisher.Great stories and plenty of action is what makes this series so compelling to watch.This is the sixth season released by CBS/Paramount.Only two more seasons left as it ran for eight seasons.We should be able to get the whole series as CBS/Paramount usually release the full series when they run them as whole seasons and not split into volumes.Excellent picture and sound quality which is what you expect from this company.One of the great shows of it's time and still is."
1,BUYER BEWARE: These are NOT made in the USA,"Despite the product description where the first line reads: ""Neiko Tools USA"", these are, in fact made in another country (I'll give you a hint, it starts with C).Misleading and deceitful company and they are garnering sales off of putting ""USA"" in their name."
3,Disappointed in Virginia,"This recording is a disappointment. Yes, the singing of MacRae and Jones is beautiful, and I even like Didier Deutsch's liner notes. Shame it's all ruined by the remastering. What a disaster! When one considers the beautiful, demo-calibre remastering that RCA has done with its mid-fities recordings of Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra and Saint Saen's Symphony No. 3, there seems no excuse for the painful sound of this CD. I can forgive the slight tape hiss that appears in a few portions. It's the shrill tonality of the entire disk that robs the performances of their beauty. Then there's the editing. Please explain why on a CD (not a DVD), a full 20 percent of the disk is devoted to to the sound of dancers clumping around the sound stage. I don't know if there's a better recording of Roger and Hammerstein's masterpiece, perhaps the folks at Angel will try again."
4,very relaxing,"i only used this video a fe wtimes whne i was pregnant because well i just was kind of lazy and tired alot after working, also being very overweight it was hard to get on the floor some days. but when i did watch it, it was very relaxing, especially the music. i was thinking of starting to use it again because i have a bad back and it would probably be at the right pace for me. Some things i couldnt do because i wasnt flexible enough and haven't done much yoga prior, but then i would just continue with my breathing instead."
5,Great Read,Wow! Talk about getting irritated at how things work in this world. It is quite frustrating and annoying to feel impotent.
5,Thought Provoking,"After the first couple of pages, I was worried that this book would be an irrational conspiracy theory (even the title hints at that); but by the end I found myself thinking about the concepts mentioned in the book. The best part about it (in my opinion) is the historical and cultural references that the author inserts throughout the basic story line. This book is not snobby; unlike other political or world cultures books I've read, the author does not assume that the reader knows the background and history of certain events. Instead, he explains and offers suggestions for further reading. The material is well reasoned and thought provoking; I highly recommend it!"
4,Love or Hate it...,"It seems that this book is either a love or hate it affair. I think that the book was a useful look into the ethics of American business and foreign politics, but I also think the book is a little sensational. I must however question the motives of all of those who rated the book, it looks like conservatives rated the book very low, while lefties, tended to go the other way. Like I said I think that the book was an interesting look into foreign affairs, I would read this book again."
1,Worst book I have ever read,"Perkins is so far out there in imagined fiction, the reader has a hard time believing even the tiny bits that may otherwise be believable. His whole tone is bogus. Recent news shatters every part of his book, with the G8 forgiving third world debt. And, one has a hard time looking at the US today, under assault in all regards--industries, debt, jobless growth, stagnation in standard of living and so on, and being able to digest this kind of ""America is an evil empire"" nonsense. We are the brightest cultural light on the planet. But, we all know ""empires"" and great cultures first fall from within. Perkins is leading the charge. He should be deported."
4,Ok,"This product was true to the description, after I removed a large cluster of mysterious schmutz from the front cover. It reads like a book, and I am satisfied"
1,John's adventures in Wonderland,"John seems to think the CIA and NSA are interchangable overlooking the fact that the NSA is a code-breaking organization. It would have been nice to hear a few SPECIFIC, VERIFIABLE examples of his economic assassinating while working for Charles T. Main. As it is it sounds like the ramblings of a frustrated spy wanna-be turned conspiracy theorist."
1,dreamer,"this guy is a dreamer and story teller, full of selfserving hubris much in the line of Fakenhype 9/11"
2,"Intruiging Title, Somewhat Disappointing Content","While there are some elements in the Perkins book that are authentic and accurate, the implied conspiracy theories and self-inflating descriptions should be taken with more than one grain of salt. As a read, the book is moderately entertaining for its first half, but it lapses into tiresome moralizing as it goes on, which is less interesting. Economic development has always been a mixed bag, with the bad getting most of the press. The author's views of the process from inside an organization that in the end proved itself to be inept feels out of balance with reality, as others who went about development under the notion that successful business is a necessary catalyst for social change would maintain."
3,Get the book- NOT the audio version,"Content aside, the audio version of this book is the worst performance by an audio reader that I have ever heard. Terrible. Can't even finish it on CD."
4,Best of both worlds,"Well written, easy to read, and extremely interesting information. This books provide an interesting insight into the other side of our ""reality"".This should be a must read for everyone, if nothing else than to show there is always two sides to every story. In this case, the majority of the population has no idea about the side of the story being detailed in this book.More references and hard evidence would make this 5 stars."
3,Confessions of an Economic Hitman,"Book was interesting. However, if the situation is true (as author says) why wasn't he ""eliminated"" as well by jackals?A very good ""insider"" story of world economic events and US conspiracy from a different viewpoint."
2,Confessions of a Fake,"The author has a decent writing style and tells a good tale, but I think his perception of his role in world events is over-inflated. His secret meetings with NSA and that Agency's supposed obsession with recruiting him is simply ludicrous. That portion alone pegs this dude as a secret agent wannabe. Nice try."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"I just finished this book. It was terrible. I was expecting some juicy personal insight into some vast conspiracy I was unaware of, but instead it's a boring diatribe by a new age junkie who thinks he is a corporate Jesus Christ. Be ready for a rambling lecture of his conspiracy theories, much of which are conjecture and unproven. You would expect a ""confession"" to mean a personal view on the events he talks about as in HE WAS THERE, but no - this book feels like it was written by my yoga instructor. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
1,This guy is scum,"In spite of all the moralizing, the whining, and the handwringing, he just keeps doing it. . . and doing it . . . and doing it . . . for the money! The historical record is really valuable, though disgusting, and I actually recommend reading it for that purpose. But the gorge rises in your throat about the human being. I'd encountered John Perkins in his persona as ""shuar shaman,"" actually once attended an all-day seminar of his in the nineties, and wondered where he got the money to live that life style. Well, now we know!"
2,Yawn...,"While it does contain a few interesting bits here and there (mainly in the first half of the book) this book fails to live up to the buzz surrounding it. There were few actual ""insider"" details (or details of any kind, in fact) and the author's voice grated on my nerves -- very self-serving. I suppose those interested in U.S. foreign and overseas development policy during the Cold War and post-Cold War era will find it worth reading, but getting through it is something of a chore. It took all my will power to plow through the last quarter of the book..."
3,Very first Person,"How the first world suckers third world countries into taking out big loans for engineering projects constructed by western firms. The third world countries soon default on the loans, and then the west takes over the county demanding compliance in UN votes, handover of infrastructure, and general control of the country. It is a first person, blow by blow account of his adventures in Ecuador, Panama, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia. He explains what is going on behind the scenes with contractors like Halliburton and Bechtel in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is also about his struggle with his conscience, gradually giving up the money to betray the poor of the third world. The author maintains a website: johnperkins.org."
5,Must Read,"This book opened my eyes to a large degree. I think it is something that everyone needs to read to expand their horizons, and take a moment to view the world from another man's perspective.Well written, insightful and very readable.I am handing my copy off to friends and family to make them read it as well."
2,A Magazine Feature Stretched to Fill a Book,"Perkins provides precious little detail in his work as an ""Economic Hit Man."" First, the book is about making other countries dependent on foreign debt. This is not news and being the economist who creates the lofty projections does not a hit man make. There is none of the cloak-and-dagger intrigue that you might expect.Second, Perkins never discusses what he actually did. In nearly 300 pages he simply says he ""cooked the books."" This gloss deadens a book that might have had some real meat. Indeed, an account of 1970s and 80s Jakarta is really neat and vivid, but that can be accomplished in 5,000 - 10,000 words. Where is an explanation of the assessment process, a comparison of reality vs. his projects, etc.?At best, this is a ""tell-some"" book, with a lot of lofty conclusions."
5,I'm surprised John Perkins is still alive,"Thank you for talking John.Turn off your desperate housewives, and American idol long enough to see what is really going on in our world.Wake up people!"
2,Too-late lamentations of a willingly seduced con man,"The negative reviews have covered the reasons why this book fails. First, Perkins is no economist. His 'hit man' work had nothing to do with economics; it had to do with his own personal greed and ambition. Second, he happily allowed himself to be seduced by Claudine, money, perks, and exotic locales. Third, he had no scruples. Bad enough that he knew little practical economics, he was more than happy to make up numbers to please his bosses and maintain his lifestyle. He knew what he was doing was wrong almost from the start. Fourth, even hit man who confess deserve to be punished. It is hard to simply say ""I'm sorry"" and ask to be considered a whistleblower.The overall feel of the book is some sick parody of economic aid efforts or, worse, a tragic version of Austin Powers, Man of Mystery. If the results were not so sad, one could almost laugh."
1,Propaganda.,"What a fraud. I'm an open minded person, but this is over the line. It wreaks of progressive talking points and the actual story is a complete fabrication (PERIOD!). This is a liberal's pipe dream of an ""evil capitalist's"" tell-all. Don't waste your time with this garbage, unless you are still sitting in an 'occupy camp' and looking for something to pass the time affirming that you are doing the right thing. Pure crap."
3,Interesting book but,"The book has the suspense of an action novel on a global scale. The author's political views are far from balanced, however, and the strong bias seriously detracts from an objective analysis of the issues. The assertions regarding 'corportacracy' seem overblown and conspiratorial in nature."
5,Change,"This book explains to me the fact that Coca Colonialism was alive and well and why the dream of Obama's policy of change brought voters out to vote for change. Not that much has changed but we clearly see the need for it. This author changed, many will understand why."
3,Repentant Man?,"I found the book to be interesting from the standpoint of one man's perspective on two decades of US empire building. I have no doubt he believes what he writes and Americans will surely be reviewing with more than a passing glance the foreign policy decisions, past and present.I can appreciate this author's guilt by his role in ""empire building"" but he continually dedicates small portions of the books to self reflecting judgment and, more of less, implicates his upbringing, NSA profiling and a myriad of other BS excuses for why he continued to do what he did. Tell the story but please don't defend yourself to me."
5,Engaging and Powerful,"Totally changed the way I look at the ""financial aid"" our government and others around the world provide to impoverished countries."
3,Confessing all the way to the bank,"I notice that I rate this book higher than many other reviewers. It was enjoyable reading. John Perkins fancies himself as James Bond and has had some interesting adventures as an operative for Corporate Imperialism. Then,out of guilt,he tells us he turned into a Knight of the Ecology roundtable. Now,he writes a confession that smacks of profiting from his misdeeds and takes it all the way to the bank. That's Capitalism for you!"
5,Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,A detailed look at how the US abuses its power through economic blackmail and worse in Third World countries around the globe. A must read for anyone who cares about this country and the rest of the world. The book has led me to books by Graham Greene and Arnold Toynbee.
2,"terribly written, but still terribly important book","given the importance of the subject matter presented in this book, it is highly disappointing that it is written with such poppy sensationalism, in a style that immediately makes the author and his story less credible. in a time when so many of the united states' interests abroad are tangled up in natural resources and huge loans to developing countries, it is critical to understand how our country is manipulating some of the poorest nations in the world to serve its own interests. if you can wade through the amateurish storytelling, what emerges is an interesting, not entirely surprising account of just how this happens. again, important, but just so poorly written."
3,Very good construction but...,I'm always looking for a trouser sock/knee high that won't fall down. These socks are very well made and look good but they don't stay up. Perhaps I have the wrong size but I was not impressed.
3,"OK, but still not the one I'm, looking for.","On the plus side: *not* one size fits all because they have two sizes. The weave is good and the color is right.On the negative side: no woven-in heel which would make the sock fit better and last longer. Even size 2 is still pretty tight on my heavy calves, not a good thing for a diabetic.Not as bad as some I've sampled: I'll use the one pair I bought, but I am still on my search for a better fit."
3,Rituals Then and Now,Compelling documentary hosted by Philip Gardiner about the importance of rituals and traditions and their place throughout history. Interesting and useful examples of how they are recreated today or how they have been carried forward in diverse and unexpected ways.
3,Power of Goodbye,"These remixes are ok, but disapointing after the great remixes of Frozen and Ray of Light we were treated to. The Dallas Austin mix is really nice, but the others tend to be repetitive (HINT: Come Freedom times 8 minutes). Still its a nice single to have."
4,Rubbermaid Pull Down Spice Rack,"I love this product! The only tricky part about it is the installation. Fortunately my husband is very handy and got it placed in no time. However if you don't have a mechanically inclined person around, this product could be difficult. There are no instructions, just a picture which for some is not enough. I love now that I can see all of my spices and they pull down for easy access, and in my opinion makes it totally worth it"
4,Love it,This was a Christmas gift for my Girl Friend. She was so excited! She is a avid cook and has been looking for something to help her organize her spices.
3,It's short but true to size,"The description didn't say how long it is but I thought in the picture it looked longer, but it's not; very short."
2,Christian-based hip-hop,The tunes are catchy and very listenable. I don't care for the Christian hip-hop theme but it is very interesting that a record like this exists. Warriors is a rabble-rousing tune. Worth a listen.
4,A good CD to own,"I saw Eddie Motta at the Lizner in Washington D.C.in 1999 and I was amazed. He is a very underrated brazilian singer/ songwriter/keyboardist and this CD captures him well. I have not heard much of his other CDs, but I can tell you that if you like brazilian music and you like pop-jazz this one is worth the money."
2,"Not thrilled, as I thought I'd be","The book is not near the quality of the James Bond movies. Which shocked me since I usually think the books are better that the movies. This book has 5 stories in it all about 30 pages each. The stories are only ok, but if you have seen the James Bond movies and are expecting anything similar, prepare for disapointment. For some the only similarity is the title."
3,Good but not his best,"Overall a good read, but not up to par with the full length novels. Nice to see a different side of Bond."
2,Nice Watch,"It is a nice watch but the stem is so small that it cannot be pulled out, I will be returning mine."
5,Very good and concrete introduction!,"I am a graduate in statistics. The textbook I used is the Introduction to probability by bertsekas and Tsitsiklis while I used this book for supplementary and I found it excellent! It provides some brief history about probability and most improtant, concrete process of the proof of theorms, many of which are very attractive to me!"
5,Best computer bag ever!,"I've had a variety of computer bags and really needed a rolling bag. I read other review and found most all to be accurate and then some. This beauty carries more than enough files, supplies, and laptop. In fact, if I needed to carry my 17"" Acer and my smaller Dell, along with files and supplie, there'd be no problem. I'm pretty hard on things and this looks like it will be well worth the money spent."
2,Space for the Laptop and Nothing Else,"I ordered this case to replace the carry-on bag that must hold my laptop, a book or my Kindle, my prescription medications, my knitting, and at least a change of underwear in case my checked luggage goes astray. Unfortunately, the compartment intended for everything other than the laptop also contains the telescoped handle. There is a space maybe two inches deep in that compartment--not enough space for anything but the book. There is plenty of space for a laptop in the other compartment, which is designed for it, but if you insert the laptop in the sleeve that comes with the case, there wouldn't be any room for anything else in there. This case wasn't what I was looking for, so I returned it."
1,Old product. No good,So thrilled to find this as it was off the market. The product I received was old. The oil had separated out from the color. I opened one and tried to get back in solution by kneading the tube. Ended up returning the five I didn't open. You could clearly see through the packaging what had happened.
1,Certainly the worst movie in the world!,"Being in the movie industry, I can assure you, I forced myself to watch it until the end to understand how bad a movie could be as this one is best example!this is a boring, stupid and pointless... sorry I can't call it a movie as it would be an insult to the real ones! Jayne Mansfield... why the hell she accepted to be in it??? was she so desesperate to get some money? Oh well I guess this movie is certainly the worst movie ever so if you want to know what's a bad movie, watch it, seriously..."
3,A few lovely tunes (but not in tune with Battiato's standards),"Fleurs Vol 3 fails where the original Fleur excelled. The idea is similar (revisiting old standards), but the songs are lesser standards than the first Fleur's, and the arrangements, superb in the first, are quite on the cheap side here. This is surprising knowing how accurate Battiato is about the presentation of his products. The result is an album that contains a few memorable songs (including a memorable Paolo Conte's then interpreted by Caterina Caselli) but desperately limited in scope. Too bad, it sounds more like a lost chance."
2,Quirky & full of bugs,I have a Dell laptop just purchased in 2000 so it's not my computer system but this software has MANY bugs! It shut down while in the middle of typing TWICE. I lost a days worth of input once and several hours a second time. It also is not a Word .doc making it MORE work to export into a Word document for others to view and read if I don't print it out instead.
3,Bugs in this program,"I nearly didn't make my deadline because of this program. I used the program on a laptop with no printing ability and had to move the file to another computer to print. I had many errors while trying to move the file from one computer to the other by floppy disk. Many times it took two or three floppies before I could get the file transferred. Also, the export function did not work for DOC format or the PFD format. Only the web page format worked. Also, if the file is saved to a floppy and the floppy is removed from the computer the program crashes when it tries to autosave to the floppy. The program works and I did complete the business plan, but with alot of aggravation."
4,"Eddie's first, is a classic rock favorite.","28 year old Eddie Money produced a fine debut album. Eddie wanted to be a cop in NYC, but he ended up being a rock star instead. On this debut, #37 in 1977, Eddie took ""Two Tickets To Paradise"" to #22, it is still a classic rock staple, the piano rocker ""You've Really Got A Hold On Me"", a great album classic ""Wanna Be A Rock N' Roll Star"", some nice guitar on ""So Good To Be In Love Again"", the FM, AM hit ""Baby Hold On"", #11, the jammin' ""Got to Get Another Girl"" and a college favorite ""Gamblin' Man"". A very strong debut **** 1/2 overall. His second album ""Life For The Taking"" would appear less than a year later."
3,Decent for his first album,"Eddie Money's debut album features ""Two Tickets to Paradise"", and ""Baby Hold On."" Not bad having two hit singles from one album back in the late 70's. The above mentioned hits are the strongest tracks on the album, but overrall it's not a bad listen, but I'd go with his greatest hits instead."
1,Plastic Handles BREAK,Ok I bought this set with high hopes. They looked sharp and it seemed a very good deal. While the knives are sharp the handles are VERY SOFT - VERY CHEAP plastic and they break.The knives seem to have 3 bolts holding the metal blade to the plastic handle but the 3 bolts are fake. They are for looks and nothing else. I had my first knife (the bread one) break with in 48 hours of unpacking. Unless your duhl in the head PLEASE mark my words and Don't Buy this set!
5,Amazing for price!,"It is very clear and visible when applied. I messed up applying it the first time however got it right the second (good thing there's 3). The s-pen is fully functional with it, however does not have the same feel as if it were naked which is expected unless you get an expensive glass protector. It is a fingerprint magnet like many other protectors, however it is extremely easy to wipe off or clean.Price:5/5Clarity:5/5Feel:4/5"
2,Disappointed,I am absolutely shocked that this CD does not include Stars and Stripes Forever. That piece is Sousa's masterpiece and trademark!!!!!
4,Barbara Cook steals the show!,"Meredith Willson's ""The Music Man"" has been revised and performed all over the world. While it's a good musical overall, I am not crazy about it myself. I didn't care for Pert Kelton's voice which I felt was like nails on a chalkboard at times. One of the main reasons to listen to this compact disc is for Barbara Cook's singing capabilities as old maid librarian Marian. Pert Kelton plays her mother. Marian thinks she's better than most of the people in her small Iowa town because she reads French literature but manages to fall in love with the music salesman. Apart from Barbara Cook, I didn't care about the rest of the story. I felt the songs were typical of the musical genre and sometimes annoying but I do feel that it's worth seeing once if not at all."
4,classic robert preston,"though not for everyone, if you enjoy a classic Broadway musical, and a thoroughly classic Broadway performer, then this Original Cast Recording of Robert Preston singing The Music Man can hardly disappoint. The score, the voice, the show, is all well-known - it is hard to imagine anyone being unfamiliar with the production. Yet if you do not recognize this recording, or have not heard it - if you are a true fan of classic Broadway productions, you won't want to exclude this one from your collection.in its own stubborn Iowa way, it is timeless."
3,Stumped,"The presentation of this book is phenomenal which is why I bought it. I glanced through it and found its presentation, photos and text to be appealing. However, once you actually start to read the thing, it's extremely difficult to follow from chapter to chapter. They try to cram too much info into each page which makes it counter-productive to the learning process. I have benefited much more from the Fretboard Logic series and even those Hal-Leonard introductory books. I only recommend this book to those with an intermediate level of knowledge about the guitar and to those that won't get frustrated spending several days/weeks on just a few pages of this book."
4,christian family,This book has been a favorite reference for marriage and family for the better part of our 47 years of marriage.
1,Christenson recommends wife-beating,Readers should be aware that Larry Christenson recommends that a man beat his wife and daughters to make them submit to his authority. This was brought to my attention by a very shocked and upset 12 year old whose father had purchased the book.
1,"Horrible, don't order it and Espeacially! don't download it!","This software is horrible! do not order, or download it. I work in a IT dept. I am around PC's all day. This software is buggy, and it doesn't really do much. I could make a better resume in Microsoft Word much easier and faster, don't waste your time."
1,Not a Direct Fit,"While the tubing looks to be of good quality, the bend of the converter was such that the inlet flange would not mate flush to the exhaust manifold. I was unable to get it to seal at the exhaust manifold so it was very loud. I had to return the product for refund. Disappointing."
1,"Spectacular place, unspectacular guide","This book is a real disappointment. My impression is that the author is speaking to someone who already knows the trails and the area well. It may be better than nothing, but it could have been much more.In fact, I have been unable to find a Yosemite backpacking guide that wasn't a disappointment. There must be one somewhere. I am spoiled on excellent guides such as Hiking New Mexico (I don't recall the author), and particularly the Arkansas guides by Tim Ernst. All backpacking guides should be as thorough and thoughtful."
3,Mixed reaction,"I think this is Parker's take on the tv series Spenser For Hire. He doesn't seem to have a high opinion of Hollywood actors/actresses. The other book in this series that this one is most like is : Looking For Rachel Wallace.While I am a huge Spenser fan I wouldn't say this novel is a must-have. It is more for those who are die-hard Spenser/Parker fans. It is still a good read, but many other novels in this series is better than this one."
3,Device broke and return process a hassle,"I bought my DVC-1100 wireless device in September 2004 and we used it to video conference with my wife's family in England until it broke in April 2005. My only complaint with the device is that the color and contrast would fluctuate from one call to the next but after a few tries I could get it to an acceptable level. But then in April the device wouldn't start up correctly and after getting the run-around from D-Link, between their technical support staff/website and then the returns department, I began to get quite frustrated and had to escalate my request to a supervisor. D-Link has one of the most complicated return processes I've ever used, which was made worse by their employee's attitude (and web-based return documentation) that it was somehow my fault. I think they forgot that I bought the device and was now inconvenienced by having to spend time and $$ to return."
5,The Hipster Spies With His Mystic Eye---The beginings of the Riverdale Gang,"Archie, Veronica, Jughead, Betty, Reggie, & the long-suffering Mr Weatherbee. We all know them. But the early versions were often startlingly different, while remaining recognisably our favorite characters. Jughead seems to have changed least, Weatherbee & Archie are tied for the greatest change, & Reggie was originally TWO characters, merged into one! (BTW--Veronica was EVEN BETTER LOOKING!)Buy this. It's fun, & good reading.The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!"
5,Wonderful summer read,"Kuralt has a wonderful sense of humor. His wit shines through in every page of this book as he tells stories of Americana and his experiences while covering the news in Cuba, South America, Russia... His simple and descriptive style of writing flows by fast and I could vividly imagine his experiences. What were these experiences? Pick up the book. Suffice to say it spans from the story of a simple brick layer he met in rural america to a proud, grumpy soviet ex-pow who had been waiting 40 years to send a message to an old friend in America.I put this book down with a great faith in humanity and a deep admiration for Charles Kuralt. He leaves you feeling that this world is filled with thousands and thousands of remarkable stories that are waiting to be discovered and that life is full of opportunities around every corner."
3,"Cute, but not a great sequal","I liked the first one, this one was trying too hard to repeat the pattern and it just didn't flow. 22 kids, what's the point, you didn't have enough time in this movie to develop all of the characters and boiled down to about 10 characters in the movie that anybody was really interested in what was going on with them. It was fun to watch once, but not really a good movie to keep in the collection."
1,Lame,"I thought the message of the story was terrible. What I thought was really lame was that Sarah went from a tomboy to a little Lorraine, and just after her mother got done telling her to be herself and that she is beautiful the way she is she rewards her for putting makeup on to impress a boy. This implies that she wasn't beautiful before, and on top of it she said it was Sarah's ""first date"", which I thought was ridiculous! For crying out loud, she couldn't have been older than 12!Also, there weren't many funny parts in it; kind of predictable."
3,MAKE THIS THE LAST ONE,"When a movie actually has Carmen Electra as one of its better performers, you know you're in trouble. This padded unnecessary sequel is everything you know it's going to be, and you keep wishing it was a little bit funnier. Electra plays the sexy younger wife to Eugene Levy (unusually boring in his role), and her compassionate personality is quite refreshing when mostly everybody else is so obnoxious. Hilary Duff should stick to records, and Tom Welling should've stayed on Superman. Poor Bonnie Hunt manages to seem content with her role and I have to admit that it was entertaining enough to get the ""3"" rating. But please let's leave the Baker family alone now. Steve Martin doesn't have very funny lines and his character continues to be an obnoxious paren."
3,Works but poor battery performance,"I found it worked well and did the job. However, it's battery standby time was pretty bad. Finally died on me a couple of days back. I've ordered the T780 (the vacuum version of this) so lets see if that's any better"
5,Monster Delivers Again,"Monster has consistantly delivered quality cables and doesn't disappoint with its entry PS2 s-video cable. I was using the Sony s-video cable for about a week before finally hunting one of the Gamelink 300 cables at a local Best Buy. In that interim I watched The Patriot and the colors had a red and yellow hue to them. With the Gamelink the picture is clear, crisp and the colors are vibrant (cannonball headshot anyone? :)).To get the most from your PS2 you really need a set of these cables in either s-video or component (if your TV supports them). For those who are unfamiliar with the heirarchy, it's A/V, S-video, component in ascending quality."
2,Compatibility Issues,"In October, I purchased a brand-new JVC television for my PS2. Along with it, I purchased the Monster Component Cable. I hooked up the cable many times, at least 3 dozen, and no matter what I tried, all I ever got wasd the black and white picture from the Y cable. For some reason, the Pb Pr connectors weren't working. Apparently, the reason they weren't working was because my television wasn't compatible with Pb Pr, only with Cb Cr. So, just a warning. If you own or are purchasing a TV in the future, make sure that it's compatible with Pb Pr before you purchase this product."
2,"It works, *but*","Anyone who tells you there's a difference between the picture quality of this cable and the Sony S-video cable is blowing smoke. I would recommend that everyone who can get an S-video cable as that will make a great difference.Also, avoid the super-cheap cables, they're not shielded and don't have a ferrite bead."
2,Disappointing Design - can't use Home Theater Receiver,"I have always trusted Monster to provide the cables for my Audio-Visual systems. I can tell you that I have always experience a dramatic improvement in quality when I have switched from the cabling that came with a particular system to a Monster Cable (the last couple of years, I just buy the Monster Cable to start with). HOWEVER, this cable makes the very foolish assumption that I plan on using the audio in my TV to play the soundtrack of my games. The cable only allows the audio connectors to be about 3 inches from the video. This really surprises me, because I would expect that most of us who are willing to spend forty bucks on a cable probably already have a home theater receiver and would therefore prefer no to use the 67 speakers that come in most TV's. Say it with me - ""Grrrrrrrrrrr!"""
3,Should you plug your PS2 to a Projection TV?,"If you want/or not plug your PS2 to a Projection TV by using this cable, you should be first look at http://forum.ecoustics.com/bbs/messages/2/511.htmlGood luck,"
4,i have a question,"ok, I haven't really used this cable ever. I'm interested in getting it though because I have a reciever and whatnot. I heard that the digital audio wasn't compatible with some games, like Fantavision. how about the games for PSOne? does this cable work with PSOne games? I don't want to make a mistake buying it and not being able to play all my old games. if that is the case, I'll get the S-Video cable instead. someone please answer my question. thanks!"
2,Cracked but . . . . . .,"My stained glass panel arrived today, as a gift. The colors are magnificent. However, there are several cracked places. I had not thought about trying to repair it. I'll take another look at it and see if that will be possible. I still may send it back. I'm not sure damaged merchandise is worth even the reasonable price of the piece."
5,A remarkable story that all can connect with in some way!,"I bought this book for my children last year. It is one of our favorites. My six year old asked me to read it to his first grade class druing an Earth Day celebration. I have also shared it with my third grade class and they loved it. It is a book that has no time elements or age group attached to it. It's illustrations are stunning and its message is powerful. By far, it is a favorite within my home!"
4,Highsmith delivers: may not action-packed as Ripley series.,"Starts slow. Not much excitement till toward the last few chapters. But Highsmith delivers the intense and compelling conclusion to her novel. This novel was first published in Great Britan in 1977 when she was 56 because American publishers shied away... In a sense, Edith is more memorable than Tom Ripley."
5,Victorinox Pioneer knife,This is an excellent Swiss Army knife. Just the right size and weight. Very nice large blade. I especially like the lanyard ring for attaching it to my fishing vest.
4,solid and dependable,"I like this pocket knife.Actually I wanted to buy a knife that woud be a little bit smaller and lighter than this one. I'd like to carry the knife tool in my pants pocket, but this one is a little bit bigger and heavier. But, I like the nice strong stainless steel that this tool is made of. I tried the knife to carve a wood, tried the wire peeler to peel off the skin of an electrical wire, tried the screw drivers, tried the bottle cap opener, and all seem to work nicely. This pocket knife is strong and dependable, and good for outdoor activity. If you are looking for a pocket knife for indoor office usage, then you may want to go for the one that has a pen and a flash light, instead."
3,two-hand close,"I like the design and look of the knife, but the lock is on the left of the blade, so when it's extended and locked you can't close it naturally (unless you're left-handed, which I am not). If the locking mechanism had been switched to the other side it would have been a Five-Star knife."
4,Good package missing a small straight blade,"A good package for camping and outdoor/sporting use, but unfortunatley it is limited by the lack of a non-serrated blade. A small second blade would have been a great addition and more useful than a second locking mechanism for the screwdriver. It could also benefit from a corkscrew."
4,Great knife but a little big.,"I should have listened to the other reviewers who mentioned this knife was a little big. It is easy to fit in your pocket but i was hoping to attach it to my set of keys. While it does have a ring for this purpose it is too big and heavy to hang from the ignition in your car.Great knife, just a little bigger than i expected."
5,Swiss Made in China?,"I just purchased this item and I have not found anywhere on the package or on the knive itself that the product is Swiss Made.Is this product made in China? I sent an e-mail to Victorinox to enquire about where are these knives made, but never got an answer back. So I think these ""Swiss knives"" are actually ""Chinese knives"". Still great quality but Chinese quality.China makes great products, so there is no reason to hide the country of origin of these knives. ""Made in China"" today means good quality at good price. Let's give to the chinese workers the good credit for the quality of these ""Swiss knives""."
5,IT'S A MIRACLE IN MY LIFE!!!!!,"The plan and systemic treatment that Dr. Perricone has developed works! I wish there was a way I could give testimonials in his behalf on finally proving that acne is systemic. After having a child at 27 years old, my skin totally changed and I became very acne prone. I would suffer from mild to moderate acne at all times. It was very rare that I did not have some form of breakout on my face, neck, back and/or chest. I went to numerous dermatologists and received great treatments. However, nothing worked. I took the antibiotic - Tetracyclin off and on for over 9 years. Since finding this book, I have been eating the foods and taking the supplements that are listed in the book based on my type of acne. I look completely different. I even choose to go without any foundation on my face. His information is great. For the first time in 9 years, I have not taken any antibiotics. IT IS FABULOUS and my skin is radiant.Thank you Dr. Perricone!"
1,"A long, boring self (and product) promotion!","I expected to find some product placement (and there was), but had no idea that most of the book would be Dr. Perricone bragging about how much smarter he is than all other scientists and doctors and taking credit for other peoples' work! There were also a lot of technical mistakes that I found (as a medical student) that make me wonder if he even understands the science that he claims to have discovered. To top it all off, I received some of his products as a gift and they were terrible. If you are interested in MD-formulated products, try MD skincare or Murad, both actually work (and, though I haven't read their books, they can't be worse)."
1,Terrible,I really like Sinead and have most of her CDs but this is a misguided effort that totally misses the mark. Reggae are you kidding me? Reggae doesn't deserve Sinead and Sinead shouldn't waste her talent on this trash. Stay away!!
2,Not Bad more of a 2&Half stars Album,"I give Sinead O'Connor Dap for trying something different,but the Problem is this is the kind of Album that would have made more sense 10 years back when there still was half way of some interest in Her as a Artist.hooking up with Sly&Robbie is a good move,but while this Album is clearly better than Willie Nelson's attempt at Reggae,it is lacking some depth in places.Her Vocals are still good,but some of that fire&spunk she use ot have is missing in Action on this Album to give the Record any kind of overall lift.still I applaud Her in trying something different&Being Credible with it.she has dealt with alot.I Respect Her as a Artist."
4,Pleasent,"When I read this book I got a little suprise- It is not a Pagan writing, per se. Although some of the charms and spells invoke the moon as Selene, most of the material is Christian. Nevertheless, it is an interesting little book and gives some great hints about attracting and seeing faeries.There is a very extensive section on the meanings of flowers given in a a bouquet. Also the lore on some Angels, their planets, and their flowers.I would say that this book is a good starting point for anyone wishing to enhance their garden by magick... but definately not a great source for much in the way of garden magick."
4,Ignore John Q Public,"Good Lord, I am tired of reading John Q. Public's drivel about every movie. Somehow, this person manages to see every movie on every opening day, sometimes sees them before they open. In addition, he also sees every DVD, every graphic novel, and every movie soundtrack CD. And he is snarkily dismissive about everything!One of the few positive reviews I have read from him involved a DVD season of Beverly Hills 90210. So, we know where he's coming from.This person appears to derive his sole enjoyment from being the first person to post a review on anything and to bitch about the quality of Everything! Rarely does he comment on actual items about the movie, which leads me to believe he doesn't even bother seeing many of them.Move out of your parent's basement, buddy!!"
1,The worst cooler I've ever owned,"I bought one of these because I needed a slightly larger cooler than my trusty Lil' Oscar for a 3-day canoe camping trip. I pre-chilled the cooler by filling it with ice the day before the trip and my food and drinks were cold before I put them inside. Even after taking those steps, in less than a day all the ice had melted. By the morning of the second day, all of the food and drinks were warm. My trip was in the spring. The high temperatures were in the 50's and 60's and I kept the cooler in the shade as much as possible. Even so, it failed to keep things cold and I had to throw some of my food away. I would say that if all you want to do is take this cooler on an afternoon picnic or tailgating then it may be OK, but make sure you plan for having lots of water in the cooler from melting ice. It is definitely not an efficient cooler."
5,i loved this book......you will too,i thought IMADOKI! was a great book. i love the drawings and i think that the story is well written. i love Tanpopo Yamazaki being so optimistic about everything but i dont really like the fact that Koki Kugyu is rude during school and nice outside of school. but everything comes together and it is a really great book.
4,Spalding backboard,"Product was delivered in four boxes in good condition. I was impressed with the quality of manufacture and heaviness of the backboard and pole even before installation. Installation can be tricky - very important to get the bolt plate straight, level and parallel with playing surface. This can be difficult to accomplish with quick set concrete but spend the time at this stage as the rest of the installtion is very dependent on it. Once the concrete was dry, setting up the pole, frame and backboard were pretty easy, but you will need a helper. The instruction were pretty good. Have used the backboard for a couple of days and am impressed with the solid feel off the glass (acrylic) and the rim. This was the prime reason I chose this product and have not been disappointed. Overall, I would say this was a good value."
2,Misleading,"The lights themselves are beautiful. Heavy metal and solid construction. However, they list a 14 foot cord, which it seems to have, but the lights from the first to the last one (8 total) only make up a little over 5 feet! The lights are very closely spaced (9 inches apart at the top, but light to light is only about 5 inches because the lights are square and fairly big-baseball size), and then you basically have an entire extension cord length left over. The lights are expensive, and if they were spaced apart appropriately, it would be a really nice set (not sure why they are spaced so closely since they are larger and have bigger bulbs than most standard ""string"" light sets). However, you would need at least 2 sets (and somewhere to hide a whole lot of cord) to even get across a standard balcony."
2,Dale,"The low rating is because the application on Amazon said that this would fit my truck. The information shipped with the kit said I needed another kit to fit my Ford. Being a bit ""handy"",and short on time, I was able to make modifications and installed the unit. Unit works great. Next problem was the offer for the $50 rebate. The rebate site did not allow me to enter the two items so that I qualified for the rebate. I entered the load lifter but there was no chance to enter the compressor and without the compressor, I would have been denied and that notice would have come after the deadline. Sort of like a trap. I made a phone call and supposedly got it straighten out but I'm a bit Leary that it really was. Too early to tell if rebate is coming yet.Again, this is a great product. It just came with baggage."
5,The Tale of Custard the Dragon,This is a delightful book for kids and adults - especially if you are a fan of Ogden Nash poetry. My 4 year olds love this book and it invites opportunity for discussion about fear and courage and perception.
4,"Boy gets girl, boy loses girl on a cosmic scale","There are two striking characteristics in the relationship between Lillian and the author...first is the overwhelming commitment to Lillian (images, many of sexual nature, described with intense, vivid intimacy) and, second, the abject destruction of the author as the long affair with Lillian disintegrates bit by bit, complete with a failed attempt at reconciliation..."
3,More about the Campaigns and Men Around JEB Stuart,"While Burke Davis' book about Jeb Stuart is well writen, and flows nicely, I felt shorted with the book. Davis spends much of the time talking about the staff surrounding Stuart, and the battles from a general standpoint. Insight into the personality of one of the most famous generals in US/CS history is limited to the letters he wrote to his wife, a source which allows for self service when presented independently of other opinions. There is very little to explain his eccentricity, his thoughts about battles, or the significance of his accomplishments. I enjoyed the book, but will definitely need to read other works about Stuart to get a feel for what the MAN was like."
4,Cool album but no megahit,"After the commercial smashes SLIPPERY WHEN WET and NEW JERSEY,the New Jersey-based Bon Jovi failed this time to repeat that success. Only two songs from this album,BED OF ROSES and the title track appeared on the 1994 compilation CROSSROAD. This album was released in the fall of 1992,four years after the release of NEW JERSEY. Frontman Jon Bon Jovi(legally Bongiovi) was at this time beginning to break into Hollywood. So,he and his band were slowing down on writing,recording and touring."
5,essential reading if you work with people who have schizophrenia,"Detailed text summarizing the authors' 15 years' experience doing psychotherapy with people who have schizophrenia. They modify CBT to address hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, & negative symptoms. They give suggestions for co-morbid syndromes. Many treatment issues are covered in detail. They support use of medication but go well beyond the medical model. They provide a lit review (up to 2005) summarizing, among other things, 16 randomized, controlled trials showing significant benefits for CBT relative to supportive counseling or ""befriending"". They use 4 case studies to illustrate topics at the end of each chapter. Clearly written, with sample educational handouts & assessment measures included."
5,"Wow, my back feels AMAZING","I'm a 24 year old male who is fairly active. I run around three miles a day and eat a raw food diet (if you don't know about raw please do yourself a massive favor and google it...it's not raw meat).This yoga transformed my body (especially my back) and mind. I love meditation and even though I don't follow the mantras included in the DVD, I find that after the yoga my body and mind are very clear. This yoga is different than the other yoga that I had been doing (I'm a beginner) so I thought it was weird at first....but wow, the results are amazing. I also didn't think it was that great of a workout the first time I tried it...but I wasn't doing all the exercises correctly.The second time I gave it a try I asked a friend who's fairly experienced with yoga to join me. She ended up being worn out by the end and I realized what an intense workout this DVD actually provides.Check this great DVD out."
2,Kooky,ok-- I have Kundalinin with Gurmkuh. THAT DVD is like exercize in disguise. You do it and it feels fun and then you can't walk the next day. This is just strange. I have many yoga DVDs and the one Kundalini one. This is a dippy chick on a flower rug twisting. It is just too much. No real physical impact I could detect (unlike the Gurmkuh tape that kicks my rear every way until Sunday). And it just seemed silly and out there. To each his own but this is one I wish I could have previewed before buying.
2,"Advanced, yes; beginners, no!","This videos is a good workout--for that is what it is--for advanced yoga practitioners but does not connect for beginners. They would have to know yoga already to understand how it could possibly be used as a beginning exercise. Lose the ""for beginners"" on the blurb."
4,Nice DVD,Very nice DVD. Easy instructions and easy to follow. I suggest review first then try the exercises.
5,Fountain-of Youth Yoga,"I am a walking testament to this type of yoga. I began years ago with an old tape of Ravi Singh's (which I dont even think is available anymore) called Beauty & Truth. I have long since worn it out. I now own all nine of Ana Brett & Ravi Singhs DVDs and continue this practice everday.You would not believe how old I really am but my skin retains its youthful glow and elasticity and my posture and energy level is that of a much younger person. I feel at least half my age if not less. I would not even dare tell people my real age since they would laugh, thinking I am joking. Not that there is anything wrong with growing older - but if you can stay young gracefully, why not?"
1,Kundalini Yoga,"I personally was disappointed. I expected this DVD to be helpful along the lines of the yoga classes I'm attending. It's totally different. Unfortunately, I was turned off after only a few minutes and gave the tape away. I obviously purchased the wrong one."
3,Kundalini Yoga for beginners and beyond,"Still new to yoga. I like it, because it's different than the running or the weightlifting I do the rest of the week. It's a new excercise that my body still has to work up to. I've gotten more flexible and found that it helps ease some of my back pain."
3,Good for beginners,This was not a bad DVD but It was not very challenging and was less them stimulating. I did it once and will not return to it. I would look else were if you are looking for a workout. Now it does have the Tibetan workout on the end it is a real work out but you only need to do this once and then you will not need the DVD. I learned it from a pamphlet years ago.
5,Relax,Loved this DVD. I feel so relaxed after I have finished doing it. I would recommend it to beginners and intermediates.
1,Calling it garbage is too kind!,"I work with computers for a living and this is the worst piece of software that I have seen. It did not work out of the box at all. I looked up and found that there was a patch (the web site says version 1.6, but the patch itself says 1.8 when installing). I have tried this on three systems with no luck. On the HP 7955, it just locks up - no mouse to control it. On the other two systems, we could not change locations (as reported by others) and could only do two of the activities. I would expect this of alpha/beta software, but not of released software, especially after 8 published patches.The web site is less than helpful - some of the pages are blank (like the support page)."
1,Bad Release Even with patches!,I got this game for my nephews for Christmas. I've read various problems other reviwers had. I too had the same crashing problem out of the box. I also had the same problem with the patches. After I used patch 1.8 labeled as 1.6 on their site the game didn't seem to crash but activities such as petting and brushing no longer worked for me either. We have three computers in the house with different specs and video cards and all three had the same problems. It is just not playable. Since the brushing and petting didn't work the kitty happiness bar kept going down and my nephews got very upset that they could not interact with Cooler their kitten to make it happy and are still upset that the game just doesn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Bad release and the patches have yet to fix it.
3,A sample of early Barbara,"This all too brief compilation of Barbara's early recordings with producer Billy Sherill (1971-74) gives the listener a sampling of a star in the making. Mandrell sinks her teeth into some of country music's greatest songs like ""The Midnight Oil"" and ""Tonight My Baby's Coming Home"" with the zeal reflected in her later, glossier 70s and 80s records. While many of the songs' arrangements are not vastly original, Barbara Mandrell sings them like they were her own and oprepared us for her huge success in the coming years. Casual fans will want to check out MCA's THE BEST OF BARBARA MANDRELL. This CD compilation makes one curious for more of these early years, while validating to us her true stardom in the making."
5,Learn from other's mistakes,"A compelling collection of avalanche incidents which describe the events leading up to each avalanche, diagrams of the avalanche, and an analysis of the cause and how it could have been avoided. These stories drive home the point that avalanches don't just happen to someone else, they can happen to anyone who puts themselves in bad situations. This book can help you recognize and avoid those bad situations. Highly recommended."
2,Meant for the non professional,"Maybe I missed something but there is little in ""Stock Market Jungle"" that would be new to anyone with minimal institutional experience. Mr. Panzer, however, does a great job of having many of his ex-clients and colleagues give glowing reviews about the book...although I'd be willing to bet that most of them did not read the book."
5,"Insightful, thorough and well written.","I really found that Mr. Panzner did a fantastic job researching and writing this book. Not only did he touch upon some of the larger evolutions currently taken place (ie. increasingly global market place), but he also shed light on some of the gray areas such as volatility and emotion. Furthermore, as one who loves the English language, I appreciated his flowery and sometimes wordy style of writing. It is very different from the concise 'business writing style' I see day in and day out."
2,Doesn't fit their puzzles!,"This case is very sturdy and well made but one problem, It doesn't fit the puzzles!!!! You have to lift some of the puzzle pieces on outer edges out to get it to slide in."
2,Doesn't fit Melissa and Doug Chunky Puzzles,"Great Puzzle Rack, Pretty Colors, Very Sturday, BUT does NOT fit Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles. This was a big disappointment because ALL of our puzzles were M&D chunky. I find it very odd that their own puzzles won't fit in thier rack....."
1,Too small for most Melissa & Doug Puzzles,I wish I would have done some research on this before I bought it. I really wish I would have checked to make sure the puzzles fit before breaking the plastic seal. I'm so frustrated. My daughter has 5 Melissa & Doug puzzles and only 1 out of the 5 puzzles fit.
2,Overkill,"From its jacket blurb, Disneywar promises to be a lively telling of the rise and fall of the Eisner-years of Disney.Someone got their adjectives confused. ""Deadly"" is more apropos a description than ""Lively."" Page after page of he said/he said/he said/memo said/letter said/email said...It wore me out. As page 200 neared I looked in the index and saw that Pirates of the Carribean was discussed at page 399. I skipped ahead and rest the rest of the book. I will never go back and bore myself again with reports from Mike Eisner about Mike Eisner and how Mike Eisner is great.I don't recommend this book for anyone who wants to stay awake when they are reading."
5,Great read,"I enjoyed the details given in this public corporation known around the world. Very interesting read and gives a good insight to why admission to the parks have gotten staggering high...CEO's, CFO's and COO's."
4,I feel great!,"I learned a lot about skin and vitamins from this book. I have been on his diet and vitamin plan for two weeks and my skin glows and I have more energy than ever. I have yet to purchase the skin care products, and probably won't, but his plan makes you feel great and it is easy to follow. I am over 40 and my skin looks better than it has in five years. Also, it was easy giving up the bread and pasta, I do not crave carbs any longer now that I do not eat them is excess."
3,Interesting theory...ultimately just conjecture,"This was an interesting read, but ulitmately I found that the author doesn't really provide any evidence to back up what he says."
2,Cindy's Honor,"this book was ok,but it could have been better.i mean why does cindy always have 2 have her way? it's like come on .she acts like honor is her horse<rolls eyed>.and how dare she talk to ashleigh like that.what makes her think that she is going to be honors first jocky?she can hardly use her arm.still i recomend this book only if u feel u must read it or buy it."
3,Metro Canvas Wardrobe Cover,"Good cover and fabric, but it would perhaps be a bit better if it had a zipper opening of some sort rather than a drop down with ties."
4,Another Spin On Good Stuff,"If you are a true Todd fan you know that he is willing to do some different stuff from time to time, and with a twist is different - and really good. Nice arrangements, tied with excellent background vocals make this great background music for dinner - and when people ask who it is they are surprised - and want to borrow it as well."
1,Hated It! Zero Stars should have been an option,"While I hate to disagree with so many ardent fans, this has got to be one of the worst cd's i have ever heard. Not just the worst Todd Rundgren cd, but worst overall. I am a long time Rundgren fan and bought this sorry piece of work thinking that, as with some of his other experiments, the arrangements would eventually find their way into my unconscious mind and I would love them. DIDN'T HAPPEN. Don't waste your money. Don't get me wrong, Todd is still God, but most of God's creation has already gone extinct, and this cd certainly deserves the samefate."
1,"OK if you can add, subtract, multiply, and devide everything","This book assumes so much it should be considered a small refference and not a learning tool.I am terrible at math and have been all my life, and now I am going to be taking it in college. I thought I should study math before I tried to attempt it at college, so I got this book. Boy was this the wrong book for me. It starts out assuming you are very good at addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. They give you problems like 6 - (4 + 2) + 8 4 before they even discuss any of the operations used. Look in the table of contents and you won't even find a section on addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Its all covered very minimaly in one section on whole numbers. Before you can even say the word you into adding, subtracting, multipling and deviding fractions.This book is definetly not for people who have real problems with math."
4,One of Puerto Rico's greatest soneros.,"Most of Marvin Santiago's big solo hits are all here. ""Fuego A La Jicotea"", ""Sonero"", ""Vasos En Colores"", ""Para Usted"", ""El Pasajero"", ""Frente A Ustedes"", ""El Mangoneo"" and ""La Libertad"" are stone Salsa classics from one of the greatest soneros of all time. Marvin's incredibly raw and unrefined vocals coupled with an unashamedly street-oriented improvisational approach put him in a class by himself. Despite some tracks' relatively poor sound quality I strongly recommend this 2-CD set to all Salsa fans."
3,A little disappointed.,"Although I still admire Maya Angelou because of all she accomplished in her life, I could not get past some of the generalities she makes in her book. I found I disagreed on many issues with Angelou, and why wouldn't I? To point out the obvious, I am white, and she is black. But, that doesn't even matter. She is a woman who should reach far beyond me in philosophy and wisdom because I am merely a 16-year old girl. However, when Angelou talked about the mulatto bastards, I could not help being offended. I am not implying that race should be an issue in any way, but it is hard for me to understand why Angelou has this viewpoint. I guess I was hoping for more philosophy out of the book, not a story of her life."
3,Not what I expected. I expected it be more exciting.,"I am a true fan of Maya Angelou, but this was not one of her better books. I did read the book in its entirety. It had some exciting moments, but it was not what I expected from Maya Angelou. I wanted to read the book after seeing it on Oprah's Book Club. I truly believe it could have been more exciting."
2,disappointed,"The heart of a woman was not an easy read for me, i just couldn't get into it, it did not grab my attention."
3,GOOD but not the BEST,"It's as if we never left the 80's! The cd was good, and i liked the fact that there new album came on heavier than there older stuff. The only thing that disapoited me was the the remake of the song ""In God We Trust"" (much weaker than the first one).All around though three stars for effort and the fact they were a great band."
3,It is okay,I love Stryper but this is too much of a diversion from their music. I would recommend it though for the die hard fan
1,Not Reborn at all,"I loved Stryper for all the things that were and are not on this album. I think Reborn is a weak, uninspired album stuffed with clichés. Really, I am a big Stryper fan, but I could not listen to this album more than three times. I turned it off halfaway the album when playing it for the third time. Worst thing? They killed a great song 'In God We Trust'. I don't understand this album. If you want to know what a flat tire sounds like...listen to Reborn. One star for the effort and out of respect for a band who can do a lot better."
5,Fujitsu scanner is a miracle in a box,"Absolutely love this scanner. First and foremost other companies should have the people who wrote the set up instructions for this scanner work for them. It was a breeze getting it started and set to go. I watched a few online videos from the Fujitsu company and was ready to scan and get files onto my computer in a snap. The color images it takes is excellent as well. I scanned some photos to test it out and the scanned images actually looked better than the originals.Another great feature is how easy it is to extract a document if it get jammed-just pull a lever towards you and the paper releases. After that the menu pops up again on your computer asking you if you want to continue scanning. What could be easier?I give this scanner super high ratings for all the features it is has, and for its' simplicity of use."
4,A great duplex scanner.,"The S510 is a great little duplex, color scanner. It about the size of a shoe box, scans both sides in the same pass, and comes with a nice software bundle. Please note this this scanner is not TWAIN compliant, so it will not be recognized outside of the software that it runs with. That is the only negative aspect to this scanner. Setup is incredibly easy and the programs that come with it are very easy to use."
2,Love the size but too many paper jams,"I purchased this product over a month ago and I love that it doesn't take up too much space. It is very small and scans pages pretty quickly. The major issue I'm having is that the pages tend to jam too often. It doesn't matter if the paper being inserted and scanned is old or new, previously stapled or whatever. There are times when the scanner works really well and I do not have issues with the feeder. But more often than not I have to feed even a 3 page document because it continually jams. I did not purchase this product anticipating I would have to constantly feed documents 2 pages at a time. The product description boasts that it can hold up to 50 pages. Unfortunately, you'll be feeding the majority of those pages."
4,Private Investigator,I have been scanning large amounts of documents for several years. I bought the S510 about three weeks ago and I have already scanned over 3700 pages. No problems and it's very fast. The quality scans are great.This is the best investment I have made in years. It's great.
5,"Small, logical...at the front of the pack","I was not sure what to expect.It does exactly what it says, sort of rare these days. It also does it exceptionally well.If you need a great scanner that can do 1 or 2 sides, moves quickly and has an easy, up front interface look no further. You have arrived. Is it a bit pricey? I suppose, but you truly do get what you pay for. I paid for quality and that is what I got.You will be 100% satisfied."
3,No red letter?,"It would have been nice to add red lettering..Flex Burgundy? Your a bible publisher so be honest, It's paperback. For the price of this paperback bible you could have added red lettering. I guess you would CHARGE MORE though huh?"
2,There are better games,"When my family and I get together, we typically like to play games in groups. I thought that this game would be fun, but it was only so so. First, the directions for the game are so complicated that explaining the game to everyone for the first time is a pain. My brother joked that it was ""designed by a woman"" (as it is a gender game and the details in this game are bizarre). I also thought that the ""bicker"" cards in the game were extremely sexist and I was embarrassed to have our 14 year old niece playing with us. You can design this game to be fun without having to have include sexual references such as ""men move four spaces ahead because at least you're getting some"".This game should have been designed a bit differently and use caution when playing with children."
1,Don't buy this game!,I bought this to play at a fun New Year's Eve party and it was NO FUN at all! It was very slow to play it and it was not entertaining in any way. We ended up playing Scattagories instead and having a blast.
5,My Favourite,"So, this Heyer is my favourite. Truthfully, I think it one of her best. The characters are hi-def and real, the descriptions are amazing, and at times I could hardly keep from laughing out loud (and several times I did). Heyer is witty and humorous at all times, but this is one of her better efforts. Well worth a read."
5,Witty and highly entertaining!,"I love GH books and this one is my favorite so far. It starts out a bit slow but it turns out to be a page turner and absolutely hilarious. Some of the scenes and conversations made me laugh out loud if not just grin from ear to ear. Although some people don't care for the Lord of Worth, he is my favorite male character in her books so far. A must read! I plan on buying it to add to my collection for future reading enjoyment!"
4,Wholly captivating!!,"I'm an avid Georgette Heyer fan, & I'll say this of her-among all the Regency authors, she's the best!! With her its not just romance alone, but humour,sarcasm,wit all get combined to produce a novel to captivate the reader. This book tells about the vivacious heroine Judith Taverner & her battle(of wits)against Lord Worth. It also has a little pinch of mystery- who wants Peregrine dead? But if i tell u the answer to that, u won't read it, will you? so i'll keep mum, & go ahead, buy this book. You won't regret it!"
4,Very nice jacket,"I am very surprised by how nice this jacket is. The outside is very soft, and the jacket has some stretch to it. I don't really think it runs big, I am a size 8 and ordered a medium and the fit is very nice. For a light jacket this is very nice, I wish they were still in stock, I would have gotten additional colors."
5,My favorite Christmas Album,"Eydie's voice is so amazing, and this album brings back ALL of my childhood Christmas memories. Wonderful album, I'm so glad I was able to find it!"
5,One fine remote,Remote works great. I received it before I even received the Wii that I ordered it to go with.
1,The Good Rain,"Thomas Egan's book covers important material in a way that sacrifices substance and materiality for simile, metaphor and stereotype. To me, Egan did not make a distinction between pulp reporting - in a medium that is read and immediately tossed, recycled or used to wrap garbage or line a litter box - and writing an enduring full-length, non-fiction book.Like a news reporter, he protected his sources to the extreme. His citations are scanty, and he omitted footnotes and bibliography. His descriptions of some historical figures are glib [Isaac Stevens, Chief Seathl]. Some of his data derive from popular myth - not from scholarly research - so the myths are perpetuated. He also comes across as an Anglophobe.Shame on his editors and advisors. Shame on him. If his sources were cited, his work might be a convincing treatise for ecologists and historians. His shortcomings are maddening."
4,A Fun Discovery after years of Curiosity..,"What? Into reading westerns? Not hardly. But as a lover of pioneer stories, stories of struggle and survival, about the growth of our country, and after many years of being curious about L'Amour, I thought ""why not"". What a great fun read. Excellent writing, Good action, interesting characters, fascinating history, wonderful sense of place, though fell short with the romance, for me. Especially good read when you're feeling a little under the weather and need something light. So glad I finally read a L'amour and now know what so many have loved for years."
3,Lack of information,"I was shopping for an alarm clock and came across this one. But, there is no product information in the Amazon listing! At least, not at the time that I wrote this review. So here is some product information I found elsewhere on the interwebs:Product: Advance 6016 Battery Operated Digital Alarm Clock* Large Snooze / Light button* Ascending alarm* Repeating snooze* Easy to set time and alarm controls* Requires two AAA batteries (not included)* Dimensions: 3.5"" x 1.5"" x 2.5""* Weight: .20 lb* Manufacturers Warranty: 1 Year"
4,Project: Doghouse,"Vince and his mates have gone roundabout on holiday. Or something. What, I have to deal with British slang? At the 20-minute mark, I turned on the subtitles. Much better. I'm sure inevitable comparisons have been made to Shaun of the Dead, but this movie holds its own. Six friends feel a need to get away from everyday life, and visit Moodley, a tiny dead-end town 300 miles outside London. Upon arrival, they encounter ""Project Cathouse,"" involving a virus that has infected the female population, turning them into savage zombies. They'll have to contend with a zombie hairdresser, dentist, hooker, jockey, old lady with a walker, butcher, bride, and a gaggle of zombie groupies, amongst others. The most fun zombie romp I've seen in some time."
1,Throw it on the Trash Heap,"Doghouse should be retitled to Dunghouse because that's basically what you have in this insipid mess of a movie. Some British blokes get together to have a men's weekend out because one of their buddies has just gone through a divorce. Yawn. They wind up in a strange little village where the women are eating the men. Yawn again.Perhaps if they'd given the viewers characters we could connect with/care about, the movie MIGHT have been passable. I doubt it. Unfunny, unoriginal, and totally forgettable, I'd just as soon watch paint dry."
4,A great gift for a witch,I gave this to my faery wiccan freind for her birthday and she said she stayed up all night reading it. I can't ask for a better recomomendation than that.
1,"Slanted, Pro-Brit, Pseudo-Academia","If you want to read a re-hashed version of the old, self-serving ""The British Were Only Trying To Civilize the Poor Irish Savages"" line, buy this book. If not, try another Irish ""history."""
3,Decent Shotgun,"This gun is heavy and realistic, but I had a few problems with it. If I tilted the gun forward when cocked the bb would just slide right out, so in the dark during wars with my friends I couldn't tell if it actually shot. Also it takes a really long time to load, especially if engaged in combat, so I would suggest purchasing a speed loader."
3,I Liked It Until . . .,"I liked this novel and I liked the protagonist, Victor Carl. He was funny, witty, and seemed to be an all around good guy. I even liked the story premise and how they got to where they were going. I did not, however, like the ending. Blah! Don't get me wrong, I will probably read another of William Lashner's novels, but the ending of this one just really left me flat. Except for one thing . . . the portrayal of Dr. Bob, the dentist, was funny to the point of I may never go to a dentist again! LOL"
5,Its a filter,Fit our 2004 Nissan Pathfinder Armada SE just fine. Pretty easy to replace don't pay the dealer to do it.
2,rip off of two films.,"This film, as it has already discussed, is kind of a rip off of requim. The directing is similar but the storyline and the style really rips of the salton sea. Many of the charecters are the same and the over style of the charecters. I was very disapointed. If you want a good movie about meth, get the salton sea, its much more powerfull, entertaining and though provoking. It is also more original than this garbage."
1,Don't bother,"This movie on paper looked good based on the cast and subject matter but it's too bad it was shot like a music video, and not even a good music video. If you think this movie is the next Trainspotting guess again. The wicked fast images compiled used to bring the viewer into the speed experience doesn't do any justice, but on the other hand if you're looking for reasons not to do speed rent it today at you're local conglomerate video store."
2,The Sicker Side of Life,"Unlike it's couterpart""The Salton Sea"" this film is difficult to follow.You follow the main character around on a 5 day speed trip and and all the insanity that comes with it.The plot tends to be more about using speed,what it does to you&the insane life of a tweaker.After watching this movie,I felt like I had to go into re-hab.John Leguziomo is entertaining,but there are few scenes with him in it, and Mickey Rourke was good as well,and there were some funny scenes with him in it, and a few other instances where I found the film funny in a sick way.For the most part...this film wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be.If there ever was a film about showing people why you should'nt be doing speed,this one is it."
3,'Requiem For A Dream' Wannabe,"Spun is an attempt to be like Requiem For A Dream but just came up short. The characters aren't very interesting and the whole movie just kind of wanders. I suggest passing this movie up and seeing Requiem For A Dream instead. Requiem/Dream has a much better and interesting cast including Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans. Plus, the score for Requiem/Dream is way more intense. I give Spun only 3 stars for being just ""okay."""
3,Inaccurate,If you want to base a wake-up call movie to drug uses you should actually make a movie that displays drug usage accurately like Requiem For a Dream. This movie however uses a made up drug. Does this make it a bad movie? Not at all it is enjoyably to watch regardless. The acting is very well done. If you wish to find out more about this movie (I know the preview is more inaccurate) please read other comments.
5,"Wow, and Wow and Wow a GREAT BOOK !","If you ever wondered how we got to modern horse racing from the past, and who was famous in the past, then this is a MUST HAVE Book for your coffee table or library.I almost cried when I read about Ruffian, and I remembered her tragic spill in the famous male/female match race with Foolish Pleasure. I was a child at a family friend's house and it was dark and raining, and the beautiful Ruffian went to the lead and then tragically fell sending her into immortal status.The John Henry story is a book possible all by itself.A great job by Mark and Mary Simon, I was very impressed and I'm in the business.Best Regards to All, MC - TheStickRules.Com"
5,Perfect,"Bright, cheery, works just as it should. Quality product as you'd expect from Le Creuset. I sit it in the window when not in use just because it's so pretty!"
5,My wife loves this,"My wife is quite a cook. She uses a lot of her own herbs and spices. She has a real gift for seasoning. She had a mortal and pestle from her herbalist days, but the pestle was dropped and broke, so I bought her this. It's a nice color. The old one was plain white. She says that it has a rougher surface so that it grinds better than her old one. The mortar is a little smaller than ideal, but not smaller than what she had. For the most part, it is a good size for grinding herbs and spices for dinner. It seems to be durable, though I have no doubt a fall from the counter could break it. So, be careful, I say, don't drop it. That's how the old one got broken. This is nice because it isn't simply utilitarian. It is attractive, with the little design and the color. But it loses nothing of its function in being attractive. Good price too. I recommend."
1,Computer Geek,"From a extreme computer user I would not recommend this product for anyone that wants to get into Linux. Linux can be a little difficult when you have been a long time windows user. To get the most out of linux you have use linux the way it was meant to be used. There is plently of info on the net, than go download Mandrake Linux for free. It makes it easy to partition your hard drive or install onto a seperate one."
3,Author seems bitter about her experience...,"I liked the idea that this book would deal with the emotional side of IVF, but the ending was just too bitter and pessimistic for me. It seems the author blames every problem with her pregnancy and babies to IVF just because she can't get over the fact that they were technically conceived outside her body. Even though one should be aware of all the difficulties of this procedure, I prefer to read something more optimistic since I am about to start this process myself and I need all the hope that I can take."
1,Worst SAT Prep book available.,This along with the critical reading and writing 'workout' are terrible. I can't believe the Princeton Review puts out books like this that are riddled with errors. Literally EVERY OTHER PAGE has an error on it. Somebody sue these scam artists.
3,Somewhat dry and the ideas aren't linked very well....,"I took a class which required this text for reading thoughout the term. I found it to be hard to follow and a little on the dry side. Several topics could of been linked together, and several statistics in the book where quoted twice with varying values. I also found over ten typos without looking."
3,That 'Dangerous' Age,"Michael Farish,at forty-five a very successful investment banker, thinks back over significant events in his life when he discovers that his beloved wife, Flora, is having an affair. Michael has always been a dutiful son, husband, father,soldier, and colleague, but the discovery of his wife's deception, coupled with a crisis at work totally unravels Michael. The novel has all of the expected ingredients of a good melodrama: troubled teenage son, troubled stepdaughter, adultery,alcohol, and business politics. Will Michael overcome his mid-life crisis or will it overcome him?"
2,DIVE!!,"I am a huge Hip fan. I have every CD of there's. This is by far there worst CD ever. The Hip have a really good habit of making each CD sound different. The single My Music@Work is the only track worth listening too. Maybe listening to them for years, and seeing them live on multiple occasions, I'm trying to compare them to there earlier success of Road Apples, Fully Completely, and Day For Night. This CD was really disappointing."
2,A 2 star album from a 5 star band.,"If you were going to own just one Hip album, this isn't the one I'd recommend. Instead start off with ""Up To Here"" and then come back for this one after you're hooked.I'm a big fan of the band, but I was disappointed with this album. In fact, if I wasn't comparing to what I knew they could achieve I'd have given this higher marks."
4,My first Hip album ever...,"Music @ Work was my first TTH album ever, and remains one of my favorites. The band has come a long way from this style of music with the recent release of 'In Between Evolution' and the difference is quite stark. The days of 'Music @ Work' seemed to have been simpler times, with simpler, more 'popular' tunes and solid, stick-with-you songs. ""The Completists"", ""Tiger the Lion"", and ""Sharks"" sit high on my favorite Hip songs list. A definite must-have for your Hip listening pleasure. There is just something about song lyrics that actually mean something..."
5,"Listen carefully, it WILL grab you.","Half of the Hip albums grab you right away, the others require more thoughtful consideration. This is one of the latter.I was able to transcend this phenomenon by listening to the whole album in one beer augmented marathon sitting with my headphones - as loud as I could physically take. Now I get it!It is a stunning album that greatly rewards your dedicated attention. It shows such huge growth from this band and judging it against there previous work is almost futile."
3,The Hip?,"""Music @ Work"" by the Tragically Hip is way bellow their standards. Don't get me wrong I liked the album, but compared to other Hip albums, M@W just doesn't cut it. The title track it self, while having a cool guitar riff, is kind of stupid ""You feel like a jerk, My music @ work."" But there are some gems in her, ""Lake Fever"" ""Toronto #4"" and ""Putting Down."" Gord's lyrics again are well thought out and interesting, but at times seem almost like he tried too hard. ""Tiger the Lion"" is the worse song by the Hip that I've heard, a song that is impossible for me to listen too. ""The Completists"" may be one of the most interesting songs that the Hip has ever done, as it comes at you and progresses into a very pretty and well-made song. If you are a Hip fan, you should by it; there is enough on this album to make you happy. But if you are just starting to get into the Hip, look at some of their earlier stuff."
3,Instrumental Upset,"I absolutely adore Chris Rice. In fact, he's on my top 5 favorite performers list. However, this CD is instrumental only, which was very upsetting considering how much I paid for it and how much I was looking forward to hearing it. I had searched through all the descriptions and not found the ""instrumental only"" warning anywhere, so I had really, really been looking forward to hearing Chris' warm and fun voice and getting his individual take on these beautiful songs. This makes for a decent in-the-background, going-to-sleep CD but it's not worth buying if you're going for anything more than that. You can find these instrumentals done elsewhere, and you can enjoy his other works much more. Maybe I would have felt differently if I had been forewarned- after all, I have been known to purchase instrumental-only CDs in the past- but I wasn't, so I don't."
5,"The ""Cabin Series""","I met C.J. at our local mall. I ended up buying the first autographed novel of the Cabin; I could not put it down and wished I had bought the entire series. I immediately went to Amazon and ordered the rest of the series. I thoroughly enjoyed the books (sent her an e-mail and told her so), something very different then books I've read in the past. She is writing (2) more books in this series and I for one can't wait to get them.Thanks C.J. and keep writing because I will keep reading"
2,"Good story line, amateur writing","I felt the author had a very unique storyline but felt her method of writing left a lot to be desired. The circumstances surrounding the occupants of the cabin was a bit less than believable. CJ Henderson was not successful at creating an environment that the reader was able to step into easily. Transitions between scenes was instantaneous and often left me confused as to where I was, or what a character would be doing. This novel has potential, this author has potential. However I feel that CJ should focus more on creating believable circumstances and an atmosphere in which the reader's imagination is not taxed towards participation. I want to be placed in that cabin, feel the heat from the stove, smell the dirty matress, and really feel the fear when the man comes home! Maybe Miss Henderson should get out of the city a little more? I'm looking forward to the sequel........."
2,NOT FOR TOWING,"very misleading for us speed readers,,,,looks like a 6000lb extension....NOT...for bike racks only. You can see that in the product discription...NAME IT SOMETHING ELSE AND DROP THE 6000 from the product name."
1,Waste of money!,"Note: This is NOT for towing--this is ONLY for use with a bicycle rack!!! No where in the item description does it mention that this is NOT FOR TOWING, and yet when I opened the box from Amazon, it's printed right on the Heininger box--""Not to be used for towing."" I bought this because I needed a hitch extension--NOT a bike rack mounting extension!! What a waste of time and money............"
2,Flimsy,"Honestly, it's worthless to me. It is made of flimsy square tube and the locking bolt is barely long enough for three cranks. It's not a good product for the price. I ended up going to U-Haul and getting a heavier, cheaper, better version."
5,perfect fit,These flares were the perfect fit for my f250 superduty. They came quickly and were easy to install. They look like they came on the truck by factory. You have the choice of painting them or not. They come with a flat finish. I chose to leave them as they were. They make the truck look a little more finished and tougher.
3,Fun to play around with,"All the loops and ease of use make Sequel a fun program to play around with and make music in. However, I got it for a school project and quickly found out that's really all it was good for (for me anyway). Sequel is touchy when it comes to installing and activation. You can only have it installed on one computer at a time and if you move it to another computer, you have to log on to the Steinberg site and request a new activation code. The whole process of installing it is painfully irritating. If you're looking for an easy to use program, this is it. If you're looking to do something more serious, I'd look into a different program."
1,stopped working after 2 months,"This was good while it was working.But stopped working after 2 months. Alarm clock, radio and CD all stopped working."
5,Who Can Beat Betty??,"A great CD! She can bring the best out of any song. This CD has it all. Romantic music,classic ""Hutton"" fun fare! Every one worth the buying. I could listen to her all day! Love her and loved this CD! Betty Hutton is a real class act,all by herself!"
5,Keller dovetail bitts,Whiteside makes quality bits and these are up to grade. The system is simple and the bits make the system work smoothly
5,Kylie She Did It Again!!,"From the sexy track of ""Slow"" to the funky ""After Dark"", every song is addictive. I can't stop listening to this new brilliant album from the sexy pint-size Aussie. It is very different compared to ""Fever"" and ""Light Years"". Body Language is a mixture of R&B, dance, and funk. Kylie doesn't like to repeat herself. She is just getting better and better. Can't wait what's next."
5,Pure Pop Princess Perfection,"I've been a Kylie fan since 1987 and after her second CD was released in the U.S., I was forced to ""order"" all her subsequent CDs as imports. I have to admit that Fever was one of my favorite CDs of all time but this CD is awesome. It has a totally different feel from her previous CDs and that's what makes it so great. Kylie took a chance with this new sound and it definitely works. I love hearing her vocal range throughout the CD and I'm sure that all her fans will as well. Next...the Body Language Live DVD that has already been released in the UK will be released in the U.S. on September 7th. I've already got a bootleg copy (from ebay) but will be purchasing the official release as it contains not only the entire concert but also the videos for Slow, Red Blooded Woman and Chocolate. If you're a Kylie fan, you're going to love this DVD as much as you love the CD. If you're not a Kylie fan, get some taste!"
5,Still kicking after fever,"While very different from her last album, I think it will have more lasting power than Fever. I like most of the songs, which are...for the lack of a better word---different (in a good way) from most of the pop out there. I loved ""Red Blooded Woman"" before the CD and ""Chocolate"" is big in Europe. Its a very sexy song. ""I feel for you"" is one of the most original songs I've heard all year...it was annoying at first, but now it grew on me. The only down side is Kylie's breathless voice is even more lacking in substance than usual. However, this can work in her favor...depending on the song. Other times, you just want her to belt out the damn thing. ""Cruise Control"" is awesome and should have been released as a single (pity those without the US bonus track).Standout songs: Slow, sweet music, red blooded woman, chocolate, I Feel for you, cruise control"
1,Disappointed,"100% of Kylie is just about good looks, and you can really see why she's lasted it, not because of the music, but because of looks alone, however looks don't always count, she looks like a hooker on the cover for Body Language anyway, and that isnt good....Maybe that's why it didn't sell???? she frightened everybody off?? what about the music??? the music is just dire. No personality, no emotion. There's no hint of integrity in Body Language at all. It's cheesy on every level imaginable....Musically its an album Britney would have outgrown years ago, imagewise she's trying to look like Barbie! (she should have stuffed her bra with some more tissues)....And the lyrics are soo bad its like it's written by a teen. She is 36 and has lasted 15 years, this is what she comes up with???? she's so obviously got a lack on interest in the music, its time she gave up and went into TV or something. This is the final nail in the coffin for kylie's music career."
4,Kylie's Body Language Flows!!!,"Great album from an artist that is growing!After a few listens you will not be able to get the songs out of your head. Finally a pop album that i can listen to over and over from beginning to end!!!Have a listen, give it a chance and you will go back for more of Kylie's body language.Standout tracks to many to mention!"
2,Not quite as good as Fever.....,"Though 'Fever' is also riddled with filler, this is not Kylie's best work. The only truly good track is ""Chocolate."" ""Slow"" is kind of fun (and extremely bizarre-it sounds like video game music), too, though. ""Red-Blooded Woman"" is alright, as well. Another problem is that the album version of ""Chocolate"" isn't quite as good as the radio edit-it is longer and has some pretty effects in the background, but it just...doesn't sound as good. It's slower and there's less background music-it sounds more raw. ""Sweet Music"" also offers minimal enjoyment, but as a whole, this really is a poor album. ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" is guiltily addictive, but nothing here is nearly as good as that or even Fever's other hit, ""Love At First Sight."" This is a pretty mediocre album and frankly, I'm surprised it spawned any hits at all. It provides a few mild guilty pleasures, but overall she has far better."
2,"Boring, Mediocre Follow - up","I was so disappointed with this CD. I really like ""Slow"" but other than that the songs have no hooks, bad lyrics and sound dated. I know the ""80's sound"" is big right now but a lot of these songs are too 80's. They sound like b-sides from Lisa Lisa and Cult-Jam, or worse, Samantha Fox!Kylie, you can better - I'll keep my fingers crossed for your next release...."
2,kylie SLOW SLOW SLOWING DOWN!!!!!,"i was very ecxating to get this new album!! but after a few listens i am very disappointing!! the album is in deed as the title track says very slow!!!! i liked lightyears , i loved fever but this are really secondhand songs!! only nr5 is catchy! i think it is one of her worst albums!!! where are the catchy grooves? the disco anthems? the songs that brought here back in business!!!!! is she SLOWing down???? i think so!!! i bought the japanese version for the two extra tracks , i'm still asking myself why!! and yes i am a great kylie fan!!!!!!!"
1,Not Worth the Time,"This honestly might be the worst book I've ever read. I'm a senior in college and was forced to read it for a Sustainable Urban Engineering elective class, and wow what a waste of time. I've never seen an author repeat himself more than Florida did here. He was saying the same things (really, check it out) on, say, page 140 as he was on page 35...that basically cities need to invest not in tax abatements to attract high-quality and talented businesses and people, but need to focus on increasing diversity and quality of life through developing amenities like good social scenes. The book is filled with a bunch of charts, tables, and graphs, backing up his claims that talent and the creative class flock to diverse regions with lots of stuff to do (which, really in my mind isn't groundbreaking information), but they again are extraordinarily repetitive. The book could have easily been condensed into a short article in and I would have gotten just as much out of it."
4,The Thirteenth Floor (1999)-An infinite matrix of virtual worlds!,"The Thirteenth Floor (1999) was a very interesting five star film which had to compete in 1999 with the Matrix. Good computer effects, fine acting and a plot which rivals that of The Matrix, sci-fi fans should make a point of seeing this one. As you would expect, it treats the nature of reality vs virtual reality worlds using a very plausible plot.Briefly, two close computer scientists work to develop a grand virtual world with personalities living within the code. They explore this world only to find their sense of reality challenged. To say more would be a spoiler. My only complaint is that I had a hard time following the plot at times if I didn't concentrate on the story. Overall, a really good film."
2,"Nice happy ending, but it's an awful movie","It's just another american ""who done it"" murder mystery. A software specialist jumps between the past and present, trying to find who commited murders. It doesn't occur to him that he commited the murders himself. There are some special effects in the form of green laser lights. And the ending shows nice scenery, supposedly from the year 2024. The movie makes time travel back to 1937. I wish it travelled into the future more, instead of travelling to the past. All in all, it was a horrifying movie filled with killings and not much else.I give it an extra star for the pleasant happy end."
4,A Good Alternitive To The Matrix,"When i saw The Matrix i was aw struck but when i saw the The 13th Floor i was surprised how much this resembled the matrix. First of all what makes this movie different is that it uses an old fashioned Murder/Mystery plot as its story line. The cast has Craig Bierko,Gretchen Mole,Armin-Muller Sthall and Vincent D'Onofrio in it. Despite a spotty performance by Bierko all the cast holds up their own. This is The matrix with a emphsis on character development more then action it does have action. The F/X or the f/x that there are. They are well done and the production design is easier on the eyes then The Matrix. And also the Music from newcomer harold kloser which is excellent."
3,Disappointing,"This is an incredible movie. I absolutely loved its new ideas and brave theories. It made me think, and brought up all sorts of questions. It shouldn't have made me think, because the movie wasn't prepared to answer any of the questions it brought up. I'm not going to give anything away, but the final portion of this movie isn't deserving of the first ( and wonderful ) parts. Just when The Thirteenth Floor is on the threshold ( actually, it goes beyond the threshold ) it goes into a series of...Horror movie cliches ?I'd recommend this movie, if only for the first half. It's too bad about the rest of it though. The Thirteenth Floor really could've been something. And it was, at least for a little while."
2,Just not working correctly,"Had high hopes for this combo. Keyboard is great but the mouse, more than occasionally, has jerky hesitation with cursor movement. I've changes batteries, restarted..nothing seems to fix it."
3,Sondheim light,"There are so many productions of FORUM each year that Sondheim could easily have retired and lived off the royalties of this one show. (Fortunately for us, he didn't)Usually the first original cast recording is prferable over later revival and film versions. In this case, the 1996 revival cast with Nathan Lane is slightly better and more closely resembles the score the way it is presented in the theatre.This original 1962 cast is not quite as polished a recording, but it does have Zero Mostel, Jack Gilford and the other members of the original cast sailing though Sondheim's music and lyrics with a spririt of fun.The London cast with Frankie Howard is now out-of-print but it s a very amatureish recording. And avoid at all costs the film soundtrack!"
2,Not very comfortable,"I was looking for a comfortable brace with a good velcro and received one out of the two. The velcro on this thing rocks. BUT, the brace is uncomfortable and this thing is super bulky. It minimally helps with the pain. I would not get this brace again."
4,Rocking Tall,"This is an okay compilation for Warrant, but I'd recommend their best of... album instead. The only thing bad, is that there is no ""Heaven"" or ""I Saw Red."""
3,Decent intro.,"'Rocking Tall'. If you would like to get acquainted with Warrant's music but have yet to do so, this isn't a bad place to start--especially if you want to save a few bucks. Personally, I think that 'The Best Of Warrant (Explicit Lyrics)' is a much better way to become familiar with the works of Warrant, but I am only judging this compilation for what it is. The ""Down Boys"", ""Sure Feels Good To Me"" and that sweet ""Cherry Pie"" are all essential tracks to any Warrant collection but where are ""I Saw Red"" and ""Heaven""? Well, I guess you can't have everything. ""Quicksand"" may be somewhat of an ""obscure"" Warrant tune, but it is great to have it here on 'Rocking Tall'. A sub-par collection, but not bad.If 'RT' sounds like it might be what you are looking for in a glam pop-metal compilation disc, pop that sucker in and get yourself of that sweet, sweet cherry pie! Have a good time."
4,wirless review,"I would rate this item 5 stars, except for the lack of battery door opening instructions. I found that you pry up on the side that lookslike a hinge, its just a little hatch that pops off. the phones are light and easy to wear for a long time. They have a great bass and good clarity."
3,Wireless headset,I have severe hearing loss in my right ear. Headphones enable me to listen to my TV without disturbing others.I don't know if it's just me but there is often a fluttery background noise. This occurs mostly when there is low music behind the dialog (soundtrack music).
1,Lovely. Horrible.,What lovely music Rozsa wrote. This CD could have been something special; however the performances are truly horrible. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
4,Megaman legends is awsome,"This game was one of my favorites growing up. The gameplay is super addicting, and there are suprises and secrets around every corner. With a large array of weapon upgrades and missions to complete, this game will leave you wanting more."
4,great simply great,"The only reason I cannot give this book 5 stars is because 2 of the 6 pop-ups do not work as intended. but the design, layout and whole presentation is pretty impressive. Simply great!"
3,Towing mirrors,These mirrors are worth about what I paid for them. They give me just enough extra width to see if someone is coming up behind me but they don't stay adjusted and I'm constantly having to reposition them. They're better than nothing but I'd prefer a truck that has mirrors that can be extended.
2,mirror,"Can't recommend these at all! One fell off going down the road and the other one fell off when we stopped and the mirror broke. Needless to say, I wasted my money..."
4,Decent,"I don't know what compelled me to buy this. It's quite thin but the pattern is absolutely hideous. When I take my laptop around nothing screams ""NERD GAMER"" like this keyboard.It was a pretty thin keyboard for its time and lasted several years. It got bent once slightly on accident and the edges began to crack at the bend and scratch my wrist. Corners also began peeling up from the foam, but again this was after about 2 years of constant use (hello WoW).It worked well and a while for what I paid for."
1,VERY POOR PRODUCT,"I got this about 2 months ago,plug it in, terrible. The sound was scratchy the response on hitting buttons was very bad.I immediatly send it out for a replacement one to Intec. It took till today to get here,remember thats 2 months,when I was promised 2-6 days for arrival.I try to use it now,AND ITS JUST AS CRAPPY. I am not being to harsh, I attempted to go on XBLive and talk to my friends,and they couldnt understand a word. I tried swapping it out with my sisters xbox,and just as bad.Im using new Duracell batteries,so that cant be the problem,the two test systems I used it on are under a year old.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.I should have taken the $50 I spent total on this,and bought a wireless headset."
3,Not as good as I remember.,Maybe it depends on the child but I remember these working wonders on my little sister. I'm currently using them for my daughter and they aren't working as well as I remember. I still end up needing to give her some kind of pain reliever.
2,"More brewing, less history","I had heard several good reports of this little book, but after reading it, I'm afraid it is of little substance. It contains quite a bit of history of Trappist and Abbey beers, but essentally no additional information from that that can be garnered from the internet.The writing is very helter skelter. Overall, It deserves a D+."
4,Good history on Belgian beer,"If you enjoy the Belgian styles and are interested in learning more about the beers and their history, this book has plenty to offer. If you go into the purchase knowing it's largely an educational book and not strictly a Belgian recipe book, you should enjoy it. If you're more or less looking for a quick and dirty book that gives you a starting point for brewing beers of this style, you may be disappointed."
3,A23 BP Batteries,These batteries are for door opener remotes and are hard to find. I found the batteries on Amazon and got them quickly. I have no idea where I would have located these batteries otherwise.
2,Sad undertones,"So, the song is supposed to be bragging about how glamorous she and her lifestyle are, but it strikes me as terribly sad. It produces the opposite result of what she intended: rather than having me envy her, I pity her. She's trapped in a life where her money can't buy her the things she wants most."
4,Beautiful Music. Mediocre sound quality.,"This is one of my favorite musicals and it is a delight to have this recording. The sound quality is lacking, however. They could have done a better job with the remastering."
3,Not Scary,Jeff and his cousin Debbie are visiting their grandparents.While out for a walk one day they come across a house on a hill that looks creepy and deserted.They ask their grandparents about it and their grandfather tells them it's the Hackman's House and it's supposely haunted by a mummy and that theres a reward for whoever finds it.Yet their grandmother won't let him say anymore about it.So they go to visit Old Mister Karsten to get the full story on the house.Mr Karsten knows because his mother worked for Mr.Hackman as a Secretary and they lived with him when Mr.Karsten was a boy.Mr.Karsten tells them about the delivery of the Mummy.He also tells them of the curse of the Pharoh Anubis who takes revenge on anyone who disturbs the Egpytian tombs.Yet Jeff does'nt beleive the stories and he wants the reward for his dad.So he talks his cousin into going to the Hackman House with him to search for the Mummy.Yet they get locked inside with a very angry Anubis.
4,House on hackman's Hill,"The two kids Jeff and Debby are trying to find a mummy for a reward of $10,000. They went up a hill and thier was the house that Jeff 's grandpa was talking about were the mummy died. They went inside it was kind dark. When Debby remember that they needed to find the mummy before dawn.Then later it got dark and as they went to the hall they turned on their flashlights. ""Bang"" they heard something hit the wall.Jeff ran to hide Debby did too and they kept quiet..... for a moment.Then Debby realized that she forgot to get the extra batteries down the kitchen.Debby went to get them along with Jeff of course like always.Then Anubis got Debby and Jeff came and hit him on the head with a book he got very angry. He mayed a cry so loud that grandpa came and saved them both. Then Anubis hid into the deep unown. ""That's that"" Jeff said. And that's the story House on hackman's hill."
4,Good Book--Bad Ending,House on Hackman's Hill was a good book except the ending. I liked it because the chapters ended with a cliffhanger. A cliffhanger is a chapter that ended with a mystery. I didn't like the end because it didn't end with a cliffhanger. I would have liked to have the story continue....
2,Poor fit,"I bought this after trying the strech-fit slip cover. Although the strech-fit one had its draw backs with my chair it was a much better fit. I have an old wing chair. This cover was not even close to fitting it. It is made to fit a small wing chair. Mine is not huge but definitely not small enough. It was my fault not to pay close attention to the fitting guide. It is probably because of the poor fit, but I could not get it to tuck in smoothly around the seat cushion for any lenghth of time."
5,Apollo 11 Story.......an Original Book!,"This is an original copy of the book published and distributed in 1969, made available by the Gulf Oil Company. While other reproduction copies exist, having an original constitutes having a ""book mark in history"". The pictures, while not digital, provide this reader with an historical document to remember the event in history, when ""those among us could walk with the stars"".Poetic as that sounds, it is the truth; the astronauts trained and worked together to accomplish the beginning of one of the greatest adventures in the history of mankind. If you have a copy, read it, read it to others, and preserve the memories from 40 years ago. Share it with your grandchildren. Tell them how it felt when this event happened in July of 1969. It's a keeper!"
5,excellent!,"The selections are excellent. Most are well-known, and others a bit off the beaten path.But the best is that they got accomplished artists to do the pieces. Nancy Allen on harp is always great. ASMIF is always great. The others I'm not already familiar with, but there's not a mediocre performance anywhere on the CD. They all play with confidence and spirit.Most of the wedding CDs out there cheap out on the performance. Not horrible, but any guest who listens to classical music won't be satisfied. I tried a couple of others, and they always left me impatient to ""get through"" each piece. This CD, on the other hand, is a delight to listen to, from beginning to end.If you're looking for classical music for a wedding, you need look no further. Or, if you're a DJ (like me), this is a must-have.Beautiful."
1,Why waste your money?,"I know you're excited, and you want everything to be perfect and planned down to the tiniest detail, and you're working on [probably] the biggest budget you've ever had to work with, but PLEASE save the $__.__ and buy yourself a new 8-hour lipstick instead. Then go to the library, and oogle over how many of these ridiculous CDs they have for you to listen to for free. Trust me, once you decide on your songs, you'll never listen to the CD again."
4,Good classic collection,"If you're looking for a good collection of classic wedding music and nice, not funky, traditional, well performed versions, then this CD is all you need. There's nothing modern on here, but it will give you the traditional stuff that you probably don't already have in your collection."
2,I'm No Dummy,I personally did not care for this particular DVD. I mistakenly order 2 of the same DVD and one was defective.
2,Not exactly as I anticipated,"Although the video was very informative, and contained lots of nostalgic clips, I wasn't expecting a documentary when I purchased the DVD. Maybe I just didn't read all the fine print before ordering! However, if you are middle aged, and appreciate the art and talent of ventriloquism, you will probably like this product."
1,Seriously?,"I'm a big Jeff Dunham fan and he was pretty much absent from this film. Why would you promote it with him being the front guy when he really has no part in it? I addition, it wasn't funny. Still a JD fan but wondering what went wrong with this!?"
1,documentary only,"i did not notice the fine print of documentary and love jeff dunham,by no means is this worth your money"
1,I'm no dummy,"I have always loved Jeff D. , but this , I don't know what this one was. But IT WAS NOT FUNNY and that is what I expect when I buy anything that is Jeff's"
2,Buyer Beware of Asian Bootlegs of Popular TV Shows.,"There seems to be many sellers out there taking advantage of buyers on Amazon by selling inferior Asian bootlegs of popular shows. Curb Your Enthusiasm is one of these shows with ""bootlegs"" floating about. The fact that these sellers sell their items way below Amazon's price should tip you off. I asked one of the marketplace sellers ""Hendrob"" if this was an official U.S. version and they have yet to rspond...this seller has also raised the price from $104.99 to $119.99...while I awaited his response. You may have to pay a little more with Amazon but at least you are getting the real thing."
1,NOT BUYING FROM YOU AGAIN,"So the mocie was wrapped up, looked as if it was brand new, until i opened the case, both disks were scratched, and it prevented the movie from playing. i was and still am disappointed."
1,What is going on?,"I know the hip-hop scene is pretty much rooted with this movie as some kind of Bible. But if were to get passed the fact that none of them are really gangsters, they would probably come to find that this movie is, in actuality, crap.If you want a long, drawn out explanation of why this movie is so bad, just search for the 1-star reviews. They do a really good job of explaining.Now, I have absolutely no problem with violence. I'm pretty sure that is the only reason why this movie is popular. But if you want to watch a GOOD violent movie, watch/rent/buy ""Natural Born Killers"". Not only is it absolutely disgusting, but it's actually interesting to watch. ""Scarface"", on the other hand, is boring and contrived.Watching and acting like you love ""Scarface"" will not make you any cooler, it won't make you any tougher and it certainly won't make you more ""gangsta"". It will just make you look like a lemming with really bad taste in movies."
3,bad dvd,i received in a timely fashion most of it played great but around 17 to chapter 19 it skips and freezes.i cleaned my player and tried it on two diferent palyers and the same thing.i havent any other problems with amazon at all and will continue to purchase from them.just wished that dvd was good all the way through
2,Over-rated mess!!,"If you want to see the definitive version of Scarface,watch the 1932 film with Paul Muni in the lead role and directed by Howard Hawks.It is vastly superior in every way(and I know Brian DePalma would agree!) Pacino is the best thing in this movie.The original is a much better production and has a faster pace than this one(in 1932!)"
2,RE: BEWARE OF THE REGION CODE!!,"I received the item in a timely manner but I was very dissapointed when I inserted the DVD into my 2006 SONY Player and I got the massage on the screen ""Check th Regional Code"" hence it is coded for the CA and USA market only and I live in Europe!!! Be advised people check all the data avilable regarding the DVD purchase before you make an order!!That`s all...."
4,classic gangster flic...,"A great movie but for some reason the movie starts off in AC 3 (dolby digital) then after like 30 seconds, it switches back to regular dolby surround. hmmmm"
5,al shines in this film,the most influential movie in rap and hip-hop alone.this character still has something of everyone that wants to defie the system and the powers that be.and aside from donny brasco this for me was al's last great film.to often then not he is over acting like the last 10 years. but this film was a perfect vechile for him.i did like sea of love but nothing aside from donny b since after crusing is as great as this.
1,ran out of time???,"I am reviewing amazon on this gold deal, and I cannot find a customer service page. I was constantly being told that I had time left to get this item at $17 + change. When I checked out (with time remaining), I was told that time ran out!! What's up with that????"
2,Possibly the most overrated film of all time,"Just how can this cartoon gangster film ever be compared to the majestic Godfather films? All of its characters are just totally deplorable 1980s style money grabbers with no sense of dignity or style. The whole film is unpleasant to watch, unlike the Godfathers. It's definitely a case of style over substance. There is no resonance in this film. The most dislikable characters ever to hit the screen. A really average and dated film: the 1980s were really that bad..."
3,the anti-fairy tale,"Over the top acting, fake accents, the fairy tale of the American dream. The dream is to get rich, starting out poor and then ending up with buckets of cash.In this case, Tony M achieves this dream by selling cocaine and killing those who share the same dream he does, making it possible for him to end up on top of the Miami drug heap of the early 1980's.The movie does not make much sense and follows a made-for-tv- network style of fantasy, only with bullets that find their targets and words that slice and dice as well.This old flick is ridiculous but the location of the Mansion in Key Biscayne is quite colorful.The film works best as a parable for the US dream gone bad, on steroids....er cocaine."
4,great movie,"great movie. it's a classic. :-) the only downside, i bought the wide screen version and would rather have the regular version."
1,Disc will not load,"I love Scarface and would love to see it on Blu-Ray, but this disc will not load on my LG BD-590. At all. I have updated the firmware, unplugged and tried again, unhooked it from the internet, and carefully check the disc for dust. Nada. Most expensive coaster I have ever bought. I have a complaint in with Universal customer support. If they don't make it right I will request a return to Amazon. I have read other people having skips and stalls, so I have to wonder if this is a bigger problem, but obviously some people are able to watch it, given the other reviews.I will say, if you review this as a ""Terrible movie""...well, it's kind of like being someone who hates hot sauce and complaining about the ""Burn you twice"" Buffalo Wings you ordered. This movie is iconic...even in it's tackiness. If you did not know that when you bought it, welcome back to planet earth, and be glad it's not inhabited by talking apes."
