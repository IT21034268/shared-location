3,Did anyone else notice this doesn't rhyme?,"I'm guessing this is a translation from a foreign language, because a fair number of the verses either don't rhyme or rhyme randomly mid-sentence. It makes it difficult to read. Additionally some parts don't make sense anymore. (Do any other parents know how a phone might ring ""DAN-TON-ten-six""? Neither did I.)Additionally the Madeline character keeps changing during the story. I'm not sure if she's a red-head or a blonde.So if you're buying this out of nostalgia, you may want to borrow a copy from the library first. It doesn't make nearly as much sense as I remember it making..."
1,Bad,You do not expect that a book that is in very good condition to show up on your door step with ripped pages so that the book cannot even be read.
2,outdated,Cute many years ago. I think the appropriate age is high school...as a study piece in a lit class.
1,don't read,I am taking a class at West Viginia State Univesity and it used to be known as West Virginia State College. The class is children's literature and Mr. Roger Samples teaches it and he keeps it interesting the way he teaches the class. The book Madeline I did not like because it reminded me of a military school the way they had to eat and walk in squads every where they went. It also reminded me of an old boarding school where you had those mean teachers hitting the kids with a ruler when they answered a question wrong. I did like the rhyming words and would read this to my class. It tells you that her friends want to be cut up just so they can have a scar just like her. It does not tell they pain she had after the surgery or the painful recovery of rehab. The book makes you believe that having surgery is fun.
5,Doris Days Greatest Hits,What a lot of memories this CD revived. A wonderful voice and great easy relaxing listening music. Doris Day has an easy on the ear relaxing voice. Very happy with the CD.
4,Designed for the professional,"Although designed more for the sales professional or financial services, a little thinking outside the box is not hard to do and apply the information contained in this book for the average Joe or Jane. Anyone speaking out information like this isn't the average, but someone wanting to take their careers and livelihoods to the next level. If nothing else it's a springboard to something bigger and better. Creativity is key. So is establishing a niche for yourself. If you are looking for step by step specifics this book falls short, but it is a good book to get you headed not the right direction."
2,"Very inspirational, but too basic","Steven Jonas does a very good job motivating 1st timers for a triathlon, but if you've ever participated in ANY sport competitively, this book is just too basic. It's more of a primer for healthy living with basic stretching, basic swim,bike & run skills included. Fantastic for anyone starting an excerise program for the 1st time, but definitely not for anyone remotely athletic."
4,A fundamental introduction to triathlon,"If you never trained for a traithlon before this is a good book to help you get started. It covers all the basics and leaves you feeling that no matter what your athletic experience you can complete a triathlon. It can be over simplified at times especially if you've competed in any of the three tri-sports before. However, the information is helpful and the training schedules can be used by triathletes of all levels."
3,One of the three new batteries required replacement,Within two months one of the three units would not charge and was inoperable requiring battery replacement. Can not locate replacement so will go with four triple A lithium batteries.
1,B & D Spool Cover,"This spool cover does not fit the B & D Grasshog GH 1000 Type 2 weed eater. I purchased it in November, informed the seller that it didn't fit and had to wait several weeks for a note confirming that it didn't fit this model of GH 1000. By that time, I had misplaced the original receipt. I'd rate it 0 stars if that rating were available."
3,"Fit GH1000, no drama","No drama installing into the version ofBlack & Decker GH1000that I own. Only three stars because I'm not hugely impressed with theGH1000.A spare spool cover is nice to have around, but I have yet to break one. So, I mostly just getreplacement spools."
5,Very Helpful Software,"I have been running my own business for 7 years and I never thought I needed a business plan, then my bank manager told me he wanted to see one as part of a loan application. ...mentioned Business Plan Pro and how much time I would save if I used it, so I believed the hype and forked out the [money]. It was well worth it!The software had simple instructions at every section, and best of all the spreadsheets made it almost impossible for me to mess up my financials! This software probably saved me a weeks' work!Glad I bought it and would HIGHLY recommend it to others!"
1,"Bondage Fans, Don't Judge A DVD By It's Title.","While you may be wondering, ""is this a movie based on romantic bondage?"", you may or may not want the many ""knots"" in this movie. Very slow moving, setting and scenery just does not fit the movie. Sorry bondage fans, there is no tieing up or anyone getting gagged in this movie. Don't judge this dvd by it's cover. If you are looking for something to put you to sleep, or really like slow moving comedy (which I fail to see in it), and can stay focused throughout the entire movie, then go for it. Otherwise, try something like ""Poison Ivy 3: The new seduction"" or ""The Missing"""
5,Brad Paisley video collection,"If you like Brad Paisley, you will love this collection. It is absolutely the best!"
4,"Great pictures, bad sound","Wow - there are 11 tracks on it. Perfect video scenes. The adaption of the songs into the videos is very well done, Brad is also a good performer. So far - all thumbs up (need more than two...). But if you don't own 5.1-channel sound (I don't - my cats would hate it!!), it is a real horror. You can not adjust it, it is just lousy!! Standard setup on startup is (meanwhile) 5.1, but if you switch to Dolby stereo, the change is negligable. You only hear echoes and distortions, the voice is at your neighbors. I cannot guarantee that the 5.1 mix sounds better - but the two stereo channels most probably are only two of the 5.1-channels, therefore the calamity. Be warned - the guys on the mixboard should do their homework !!"
5,The Video Collection - Brad Paisley,This collection of the best of the Brad Paisley video's is a real joy to watch and listen to. Presented in a good sequence and fun to watch for the entire family. Any fan that enjoys Brad Paisley's singing will want a copy of this DVD.
5,"Nice lightweight computer, but display hinges concern me","This is a very nice computer, lightweight, fast. I purchased the add-on second battery, and I get about 10 hours of time. The only thing that concerns me are the display hinges. When I first received it the display seemed tight as you moved it back and forth, which I liked, but now there is about 1 inch of play. I don't know if this is because I may have applied to much I pressure on the display when I opened it all the way, or if this just happens over time as it breaks in. But I still think it's a great buy! I do not recomend a neoprene sleeve for this, or for any computer for that matter unless they make a brand that has a grippy outer layer. I had this machine in a neoprene sleeve, and as I was walking in a hurry, the computer slipped right out of my hand. Fortunately there was no damage except very minor cosmetic. These sleeves are just too slippery."
5,Daniel Boone was a Man... A Big Man!,"I enjoy reading biographies, and have read several very enjoyable books. This is one of my favorite biographies.I enjoyed the way the author has clarified truth from probable fiction. He adds several stories that are likely not true, but prefaces them as such. Even the stories that are true are almost beyond imagination.Daniel Boone was a man that looked on life as an adventure, and never saw quitting as a possibility, even though he had some very difficult things happen to him and his family. There is a lesson for us all to be learned in Boone's resilency.I enjoyed learning about life in Boone's time. I am amazed at what both the men and women did to survive. The daily routine of Boone's wife would be enough to make most modern folks long for an extended vacation after one day.The book is well written, easy to read, and very compelling. I highly recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"I have to disagree with the other reviewers. Overall, this book was dull. While the subject is anything but dull, Faragher managed to lose my interest several times. Daniel Boone lived a fascinating life and was a legend but I struggled to finish the book. I probably should pick another author to read about Daniel Boone."
5,Too Cute,When the item arrived it was much better than anticipated. It is super soft and very cuddly. I bought it as a gift and almost didn't want to give it up!
5,Outstanding Book,"An excellent reference for the physician who cares for hospitalized patients. Just enough detail to care for patients of every severity and type of illness, yet not so much that you are bogged down in unimportant trivia and esoteric controversies. The book is up to date, and the authors obviously know their stuff. Things like indications for ICU admission and indications for discharge make this book invaluable for physicians who care for hospitalized patients. Now if only someone will write a similar one for pediatrics...."
4,"waterproof, tearproof and bugs away","This product does what it says--offers superior sun protection, is waterproof and tear-free, and keeps the bugs off, all using natural ingredients. The only problem? It is SO waterproof that if I put it in my son's hair, it took three shampoos to get the stuff off. It is thick and white and rubs in white, so you will a whitish cast to your skin the whole time you wear it, too."
1,So let me get this straight ...,Heather Locklear is being romanced ... by her daughter?Does anyone else find this kinda creepy?
3,THE PERFECT MAN,"This is not one of the better teen-oriented movies ever made. But after the cute remake of ""Cheaper By The Dozen"", the terrible ""A Cinderella Story"" and the pretty good, ""Raise Your Voice"", this is Hillary Duff's best movie to date. The story line almost confused me for a moment. But a great all-star cast featuring Heather Locklear (TJ Hooker, Melrose Place, Spin City), Chris Noth (Law and Order, Law and Order: Criminal Intent) as a restaurant owner and the uncle of Duff's best friend, Vanessa Lengies (Roxanne on ""American Dreams"") who plays Duff's best friend and Mike O'Malley (""Yes Dear"") who steals this movie as Locklear's co-worker at the bakery who takes her to (band imitating) Styx concert made me overlook what could have been a better story line.I definitely think Hillary Duff will have better movies to her credit as her career progresses. Time will tell."
4,Cute movie for all ages,"This was a family friendly movie. The story was cute if unbelieveable, but don't we all need that once in a will. I don't think the acting was very strong but the message was nice."
3,the perfect man,"This is a feel good movie, the only thing I have to say is they should have met sooner, I just feel a little robbed. They could have put the couple together a lot sooner, then just at the end of the movie, I sometimes feel like that is the mistake a lot of the movies make, other then that it would have gotten five stars."
2,AUTHOR TOO INTERESTED IN PROSE NOT HISTORY.,"The deceased author was by his own admission a writer. His accounts of the war in the east suffer from his desire to be literate rather than detailed in his account of his experiences on the eastern front during the second world war. The majority of the his recollections are of such a general and vague nature you wonder whether the author truly experienced these events or just an expression of his imagination through prose.If you are seeking a detailed day to day account of the war in Russia this book is not for you. After reading this book I did not gain any increased sense of what it was like to be, or the motivations of a common German soldier, or the war in Russia."
2,Fine...If You Like Poetry,"I was excited to read what sounded like a fascinating memoir from a relatively rare point of view: a German solidier on the Eastern front. What I ended up with was a rambling, at times barely coherent attempt at writing memorable quotes. By the time I was 2/3 of the way through the book, I found myself pleading, ""Just tell me what happened! Quit trying to sound so poetic!""Toward the end of the book, Reese finally starts describing what he was going through in a less-flowery manner. Then it became pretty interesting. It just took a LONG time to get there.Reese's story is a tragic one, but there are more informative war memoirs out there if you want actual information."
2,"Keeps baby's interest, but beware of wear and tear!!!","My daughter has been enjoying these toys for 3 months (she's 6 months now) whether linked to her stroller, swing or crib. However, this morning, she was able to gum her way (no teeth yet) throught the stitching on the elephant (where the teething ring is attached). Caught it in time, but parents BEWARE - from here, she could've accessed the inside stuffing. Just wanted to spread the word."
1,Useless,I am unsatisfied with this product. It bruned out after one use. Tragic really. The other revies said this was a good product.
1,Sumo 'death' tube,"We purchased this 'wearable' towable last summer (2006) during our lake vacation. I was the first one to try it. It submersed me under water to the point that I couldn't breath. I never came back out of the water and when I let go of the rope, I further torpedoed down. I had to struggle quite a bit to get back out of it so that I could get air. Two very strong men with us also tried this item. They had to hold on and hold their breath for quite a while until they finally came out of the water at high speed. Even so, it rides so low in the water that all you see and experience is a wall of water in your face for the entire ride. It is shaped so that it drives your face into the water. Not a fun experience and we returned this item the next day."
2,good idea hard to use,"diffecult to use, need hands of steel to keep holding on. Hard to get of water sometimes head sinks in the water. Its for morte advaced users, upper body must be in very good shap to enjoy."
5,lizzie mcguire box set- vol.1,"even though i am 20 years old i have been a big fan of lizzie mcguire ever since i was a kid of maybe 10 years old.my dad found it for me on your web site,i saw it,i bought it,and i have been enjoying it a lot.any young girl who like me grew up with the show should buy it right away because i believe it would be enjoyable watching the shows again.it is fun for me watching these shows again after all these years.the quality of the audio and video is superb.all you lizzie mcguire fans out there would not be disappointed if you did.like i said in my other review on daughtry,I LOVE MY AMAZON.thanks again amazon for having on your web site.""chrisfan""."
3,read very carefully,"Hi, most impressed with delivery promptness etc... only thing is i cant play the dvds most annoyed!!!! which is not amazon's fault. Make sure you read if you can play them in Australia which of course i obviously didn't. So my daughters's very upset, we have these great dvd's she was looking forward to and cant play them... i would love to know how i can play them otherwise i have no idea what the hell i can do with them.... as now it was all a waste of money.."
3,Brings back memories.,Im a 90's girl and i grew up with this show. i'm 16 now and still like it. i wanted to revist my past and jump into some of my old habits and old shows. thats so raven is WAY better in my opinion. i did like it but im not 10 or 13 anymore im 16 so i didnt LOVE it. oh well if you have a middle schooler shed love it.
5,You Will Fall In Love,I love Lizzie McGuire is amazing i don't indertand because the tv show end!But it's ok!Hilary is so beautiful and all the others artists are great!!
2,Tubing is very stiff.,The tubing is very stiff. Almost to the point of being unusable. You might be able to tear it apart and substitute better tubing if you're handy.
2,STUNNING! Ring/Not so much anymore...,"I bought this ring to replace my real diamond wedding band, to wear for everyday use. When I first took it out of the box I was amazed at how real it looks and feels. It's a fairly weighted ring, does not feel cheap. Once I put it on, I fell in LOVE with it! I actually like it better than my real ring! I have read other reviews that say the center diamond is to small or set low, but in my opinion, thats what I love about it the most, it gives it this modest yet expensive look. I didn't want a fake ring that looked to unreal for me to be wearing or too REAL that I get mugged! (meaning HUGE& SPARKLY) Overall I'm very very happy with my ring, and I would recommend it to anyone! :)UPDATE:01/10/11I am so sad, after wearing the ring just a few days one of the stones fell from the solitaire. I really loved this set, the look, the fit and the feel, but unfortunately I must return it! :("
2,Already getting dark,"I bought this about half month ago. But it start to get dark now. Is it sliver??? Not worth the price, not fit for everyday wear."
2,Looks fake,"I have to say I was a little disappointed when I received this product. I was looking for a temporary set while my wedding set was getting worked on and thought I would give this a shot since it had pretty good reviews. I knew I wasn't getting diamond quality, obviously, but these rings look very fake even from an arm's distance away. However, Gem Ave's service was very good and I received my product in a timely manner."
4,Not bad at all :),"I bought these rings as a temporary wedding set until we have a little more money, and I have to say I am very pleased. I do have a few issues with them, mostly the engagement ring. On one side the band is straight where it connects to the center stone, and the other side is more curved. The center stone is a tiny bit crooked, but no one will really notice unless they are seriously studying it or if I point it out. Other than that the rings are gorgeous. Much nicer than I expected them to be. I have gotten so many compliments and a friend of mine didn't believe that they weren't real. The sizing was right on. Overall I am really happy with these rings and definitely would reccommend them!! :)"
5,GREAT BUY!!!!,"I lost the diamond in my engagement ring after only having it for 2 years! I was devastated!!!! So I immediately started searching for a CZ to wear until my hubby and I could afford to buy a new ring. This ring exceeded my expectations! First, I received the rings 4 days earlier than expected. Second, the price was fantastic. Third, the ring is beautiful! I am very happy with this ring and I plan on wearing for while (well at least that what my hubby told me)"
3,While the item looks beautiful,"The first time I wore it one of the prongs holding the stone in broke, unfortunately i waited for awhile to wear it so it's outside of the return policy date."
5,BUY THIS RING!,"I bought his ring as a replacement for my wedding set and i couldnt be happier! The set is stunning! The stones have a wonderful shine to them, and it fits great! You would never know they were CZ's. I will definately buy from this seller again, they shipped promptly.UPDATE:Ive had this set of rings since January and they still look great! I wear them in the shower and while doing dishes but they still have a great shine to them. NO REGRETS HERE!"
1,Bamboo Cutting board splits,"I have had my MIU France Bamboo cutting board since July. It is now early January and my board has split in half. Too late to return for a refund, but a $50 board should last longer than 6 months. I did not ever wash it in hot water, just wiped with damp sponge. It sat on a flat surface (a marble top) and was never abused - actually hardly used. Quality is poor!"
3,"Minimal coupling, minimal cohesion","If you're looking for in-depth detailed information on RDF, XML Schema, DAML + OIL etc., then don't buy this book.If you're interested in DAML + OIL, and applications of it, then you don't want this book. (It covers DAML + OIL, but only touches its surface.)If you want to read about new standars rising from the XML community, and you don't have any particular preference, then this might be a book you like.If you can't cope with minimal cohesion, then you definitely should not buy this book. There's no single message in this book."
5,Classic album,We love the mellow sounds of Andy Williams on this classic Christmas cd.No one like him.
4,Glad I purchased,"I bought this during this past Christmas season. I'd always liked Andy Williams and since he passed away in 2012, I thought why not buy his Christmas album. I was surprised to find he had more than one Christmas album and after reviewing all the different song selections, decided on this one. We played it a couple times over the holidays. I would have to say this is one I'd need to listen to in small doses; a whole CD of Andy got to be a bit much, even though I did like the song selections. It was Andy stretching his tenor range that got annoying. I have very musically trained daughters and they both agreed he was much more pleasant to listen to when it didn't sound like he was trying to stretch so far out of his true vocal range. I still love his happy standard Most Wonderful Day of the Year. I could do without his O Holy Night. I remember watching and enjoying his variety show when I was a kid and I'm glad I bought this, if only for nostalgic reasons."
5,Where are Andy's Bro's????,"Still one of the best Christmas CD's ever but where are the tracks of Andy singing with his brothers? They're featured on his ""Best of Christmas"" video but nowhere on a CD. A great quartet and they deserve a holiday CD."
4,Love this book,I have used so many fingerplays and other ideas out of this book from the moment I received it. I work with preschoolers in a bible study program. This book has been very helpful with transitional activities. The kids really love the action fingerplays.
3,Nice Table but some flaws,"This table is nice and meets our needs but it was damaged in the shipping process. There is a small dent on one of the sides of the table, but being that this table is so heavy it was not worth the effort it would take to return it. The table is ok quality for the money, but you need a drill to install the screws as there are no designated holes for the screws. Also a rubber hammer wouldn't hurt for the bottom pieces of the legs. I had a few that were hard to fit into place and required a few knocks with the hammer to squeeze the piece into the bottom of the legs. Don't make the same mistake my boyfriend made either - read the description this table is light gray even though it looks white in some of the photos."
2,Bright light but switches on far too easily when in a pocket or bag,"I think generally Cateye products are very good in every respect but unfortunately this isn't one of them - the light's bright and the design of it means it's probably easier to see than when the led's are clustered, but I've lost count the number of times I've found it's switched itself on either in my pocket or in my bag..."
2,okay reading...,"This guide provided you with all their layouts and tips and you are expecting of them. The inside information your expecting is exactly what your getting. But, there is still one problem, on the back cover it says ""secret codes inside""... there are no codes inside this guide, false advertisement all the way. I specifically bought this book to get some codes to better my play. well there arent any codes at all. So dont buy the book if your looking for codes. Only buy the book if your wanting to get layouts of the courses your wanting to play..."
3,Not bad,"Very good stuff here especially for beginners and its a short book and a quick read.But for people from the West with little expereince in Buddhism I would recommend books like ""Transform your Life"" by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. His writing style is much more sophisticated and articulate then HH."
5,Great new talent!,Mozella is one of the best new artists out there! Her unique voice hooked me the first time I heard her. Try the cd...you won't be disappointed.
1,Stick with the original,"I paid big bucks for this movie that my daughter wasn't thrilled with. Then, i came across the origial wizard of oz that i had stored from when i was a child. i thought i would show it to her. SHe liked the original the best. should have saved my money and showed her my ""vintage"" one in the first place!!!"
2,Easily Forgettable,"I may be in my 20s but I love a good kid's movie once in a while. This is not one of them. Ashanti is yet another singer that wants to do more but like a great many of them she fails miserably. Her songs are fine; it's mostly everything else in this movie that bothers me.The script is bland with nothing of interest for the older viewers but some mild innuendos and celebrity references. As much as I disliked it, however, I did think that it was nice that they had a few extra tidbits from the book.Oh, and I'm all for making Dorothy stronger than the original movie but why a wannabe star? Miss Piggy is amusing but not enough to block out the blah performances of the usually wonderful Muppet cast. Oh, and I love Aunt Em and Uncle Henry but their blah reactions to finding Dorothy alive made me laugh out loud.Bottom Line: An okay rental but nothing to add to the collection."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was very disappointed when I watched this movie. The editorial review is very much in line with my thoughts. I would suggest renting this movie before buying it. By making the humor more edgy, the writers destroyed what I found so attractive in many muppet movies; the innocent humor."
2,"Buyer beware, not entirely family friendly","I didn't have quite as strong a reaction as some of the folks below (maybe that's because my kids and I just watched one of the original Muppet Shows featuring Raquel Welch - what was I thinking?!) , but I still encourage people to think twice before showing this movie to young children. The Quentin Tarantino cameo sent me over the edge. They should definitely have a sticker on the cover that says ""PARENTS: Quentin Tarantino is in this movie"" -- that would definitely have made me think twice. Thankfully my 7-year-old daughter's reaction was only ""Wow, he's crazy"" -- with which I could only nod in agreement."
1,I would turn back if I were you.,"This movie is bad, I am truly sorry that I rented it. It scares little children into not liking the ""Wizard of Oz"" story. The adult innuendo is not entertaining. The Characters ALL have bad scripts. What was with Miss Piggy's wicked witch character? She was genuinely frightening to 3 and 4 year olds, and to adults campy, and boorish. I can't say enough bad things about this Muppet movie.The Veggie Tales ""Wizard of Ha's"" movie was a much better choice for young children to watch. I bought that one, and I have no regrets."
1,Pure garbage,What demagraphic was Brian Henson thinking of when they took the muppets down the trashy Brooke road?Lude and crude humor plus a really stupid plot turn this into probably the worst Muppet Film yet.
3,Not that bad,"The latest entry in the Muppets franchise is probably the Henson family's last attempt to make the Muppets ""cool"" and ""modern"". Numerous parts of this movie seem contrived solely to make it appeal to the MTV generation. This includes the casting of Ashanti and Queen Latifah as the principal human roles, the cameo of Quentin Tarantino, the strong stereotypical Mexican accent by Toto, and the totally out-of-place CGI scene with Gonzo and the chicken. All of these distract from the movie. But what stays true to the franchise is the Muppets sense of ridiculous humor and witty dialogue. Whether it be Scooter's appearance as the Wizard's secretary, to Beaker's disappearing head, the roles of the muppets themselves were great. And the scene in Poppyfields is sure to draw laughs from crowds of all ages. Overall, I expected better, but not by much."
4,So Much in Love,Virtually all of the Ray Conniff and Ray Conniff Singers albums are very well don and thoroughly delightful to listen to ... this ranks among the best.
3,Cerebral,"This book was not what I expected, expecially after reading the previous reviews. The poetry is excellent but very cerebral! It is a Filipino version of what you study in Humanities in college."
3,It's ok,"I got both this and the Oxo corer, I thought this would be my main corer and that the Oxo one would be for when this one was dirty(or broken).I like the weight of this corer and it seems to be well built.I find the slices to be too small and I think the blades are too dull, so you have to bear down hard with all your weight to cut the apple."
1,Sturdy but not effective,"Typically, you get what you pay for... unfortunately, not the case here. The weight and construction of the slicer is impressive (seems sturdy enough for a concrete apple). However, the cutting blades are too short compared to the overall base of the ring - leaving you without completely severed pieces.Removing the thin slices from the remaining apple base is both dangerous and destroys the cut in the process.I wouldn't recommend - am looking to replace myself."
4,Worth having,"This is coming from someone who is not a die hard Bob Dylan fan, in fact most of his music just leaves me flat, but I enjoy listening to this album from beginning to end. His voice & guitar playing are both strong & the songs are heartfelt & meaningful. If you are put off by the legacy of Dylan, this album is worth an objective listening."
4,One of the Classics,"This album is a good listen from beginning to end. From the title song, right through to then end, this is an accessible album that shows an open and honest Dylan. Part protest, part sarcasm, and all emotional, the songs within speak the true Bob that many don't know. I won't even single out any particular songs, as I feel the whole album must be taken in it's context. One last note on this piece of work. In listening to ""Restless Farewell', the closing song, I am reminded of an Irish traditional song entitled, ""The Parting Glass'. If listened to closely, the similarities both in lyrics and music can be spotted. Honest folk fans won't be disappointed."
4,The height of his folk style protesting,"This is a great album. all the songs offer insight to the period and Bob's own thoughts. Personally, I like just about every song, but if you're into the electric Dylan, skip this album. He sticks with his acoustic and harmonica and doesn't make exceptions. But as I said, all the songs are great. Gems: One too Many Mornings, North Country Blues, Only a pawn in their Game, The LOnesome Death of Hattie Carrol, Restless Farewell"
5,A Place in the Sun,"Excellent movie. The characters are so very good. I'm glad I rented this classical movie. The rental price is very reasonable. And best of all, it was fun watching this movie on my Kindlefire HD 8.9!"
4,An american tradegy that we found ourselves pondering over,"While watching this movie in class I was captured by the clever minds of each of the characters. At first look, it seems that George Eastman is a shy, dimwitted man, who wants to mooch off his uncle. As the story progresses, George captures our hearts with his secret love relationship with Alice. The seemingly beautiful Angela Vickers soon entrances George, taking his mind off everything except her. As their relationship progresses, Alice becomes more and more distant-disgusted by George's actions. The spellbinding relationship between Angela and George is romantic. But as the world knows you can't have your cake and eat it too, as George realizes in the end. He ends up paying the price for his careless actions as he finds his own Place in the Sun."
1,Boring with a capital B!,This cd was a real dissapointment compared with her other cd's. It was much too slow and didnt even sound celtic. None of the songs were interesting and they all sounded the same.
1,Yet another CD from the McKennitt Headache factory,McKennitt's pseudo-intellectual garbage is best left in the hands of rpg cultists and people who run off into the woods and pretend to by robin hood. I've heard better singing on the part of wolf howls on those silly nature symphony CD's that are all over the display counters at the nearest discount store. Don't waste your time or money.
5,It doesn't get any better than this...,"A wonderful set of songs by the best, least known, singer of our time! END"
5,WOW!,"Now I know what all the fuss is about. Breathtaking. The first night after this CD arrived I had it on the stereo with my headphones on and I couldn't take the smile off my face for the entire disc something I can't remember doing for a long time. Standout tracks for me were in order of appearance: The dark night of the soul, Marrakesh Night Market, Full circle (wonderful blend of vocals and instruments) and Prospero's Speech. Not to put anyone down but I think Loreena McKennit has a lot more depth and mystery and songcrafting genius than Enya. The Mask and Mirror is the first L.M CD I have bought and it definately wont be the last."
1,My Review,"You really have to be interested in the food, culture, and design. When I saw this book at the Air & Space museum in Washington D.C. I thought there was more info about the interior designs of aircraft. However, it was mostly about the food and clothing style throughout the years. I would only reccomed this book to a person who is intersted in these topics."
4,THE TAPES,THE TAPES ARE VERY GOOD BUT TWO OR MORE TAPES STICK AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT A while before they cont. playing. other then that the tapes are good.
5,These ladies are great!!!,"I am so glad that they FINALLY put the GOLDEN GIRLS out on DVD! This is such a great show, and I find myself pulling out the DVDs when there is nothing else to watch on TV. Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Betty White, and Estelle Getty are truly wonderful actresses who execute their parts well throughout each episode. Almost 20 years later, I still find myself laughing at all of the jokes, just as if I were watching it for the first time. The highlights of this season have to be the episodes where Rose buys a gun due to a robbery, when Rose dates a midget psychologist, and the infamous Dorothy/Rose rennovate the bathroom episode. I absolutely can't wait for season 2! Hope it comes out soon!"
4,Good sodium information,Great little book. Has a wealth of knowledge about sodium which I have to reduce in my diet. However it has a lot of Brand Names that are not available in Florida and not much information on the brands that are available here.
3,The first album was very good.,"The first 3 songs on this CD are very good. I haven not heard the others. I wish the first album was on CD, the whole thing is good."
5,Sensitive and Touching,"The Light of the Stars addresses timeless questions about the nature of our existence and our place in the world using language accessible to children that will resonate with adults. Glowatsky weaves her beautiful fable of a young girl and her small white dog as they walk along the beach using recurring images of nature (the sea, the tide, the stars) to reinforce the cycles of life and offer comfort to young and old alike. This book will become a mainstay for counselors, teachers, parents, or anyone guiding children through the world of loss and grief. With The Light of the Stars, we have another wonderful addition to the library of biblio-therapy books for children!"
4,In these tough times this book is a good read..,Implementing one or two of the ideas in this book will have the book pay itself off. Most of the ideas are just plain obvious but Im sure this book will remind you of many things you could be doing but arent.
3,good book,"I did not find the author ignorant or anything in this book. I wanted to read it because I wanted to learn about quarks. Not all of the book was about quarks and I found some of these parts boring (specifically the stuff about how economics works and computers). The book talked about characterics that all complex adaptive systems share (computers, economy,living things). He does not tie this in with the quark. He does make some interesting points. It is a good book but not a great book."
3,"Grainy Video, Good Audio","I'm not going to review the movie; just the Blu-Ray disc, which is what everyone who's interested in purchasing this movie on Blu-Ray wants to read.I purchased the 2010 Blu-Ray version of this film. I can't believe that they can't make a good Blu-Ray disc from a 2005 movie. There is a lot of grain. A lot of detail, yes, but a lot of grain. It is probably better than the DVD. Just beware. For a newer movie, I expected exceptional video. It is not.The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is good (all 5 channels plus sub-woofer)."
3,Decent adaptation of a terrific twisty suspense novel,Clive Owen plays a man under a lot of pressure who meets a beautiful woman(Jenifer Anniston) on the train which leads to an indiscretion that leads to a nightmarish chain of events.Though the movie isn't as nasty or as explicit as the book it does a good job of recreating it's twists that play on your sympathy.My only big complaint is that the ever smooth Clive Owen is a little too cool to portray a man under pressure.Still Derailed is a fun film with great surprises though it doesn't live up to it's source novel(though to be honest most films don't)
3,Good Rental Movie,"I bought this of course because Clive Owen is awesome. If you have not previously read the novel which this film was based on you get some nice twists and turns. There are no spectacular performances to speak of, Vincent Cassel is always charming. I enjoyed the music and I think it's an overall decent film. 3.5 stars."
4,.....and the author intrigues his audience.,Very good thriller. Keeps you entertained and gives an EXCELLENT ending!
3,"Great Acting, Bad Script","Both Jennifer Aniston and Clive Owen are wonder in Derailed. Aniston plays the bad girl, perfectly. Its great to see her get away from the comedys she does. She has the makings of a good dramatic actress.The script itself was alittle to unbelievable for me. Theres just to many unbelievable things that happen. I can believe a married man would make a few mistakes and get himself in trouble by cheating on his wife. But the more he becomes the victim of the Scam, the more the film becomes unbelievable.There were plenty of plot twists, so the movie kept me interested through out. It just needed more of a touch of reality."
3,Could have waited for the DVD,"First I must say I think Clive Owen is a great actor but the film really does not do him justice. The film starts out fine but after the hotel room break in, one cannot help but wonder why the Charlie (Clive Owen) is so weak. It was nice to see Jennifer Aniston playing a different type of role. Once you are pushing 40 yrs-old the girl-next-door/wholesome character bit gets boring. As for the violent hotel room scene, one reviewer stated that it was offensive to women who may have experienced that type of violence. True, but is it any more offensive to her than someone who was shot and survived,carjacked,raped,maimed or had a family member be a victim of homocide,abduction,robbery or rape. It should not be. If a sexaul assault/rape victim cannot handle seeing it portrayed in a film, please stick to PG rated fare. The film loses 1 star for a weak main character and another for plot gaps. I saw the matinee but could have waited for the DVD."
2,Totally Predictable and Silly,"my title says it all....I also, had this one figured out immediately and it killed all suspense, as it was so painfully obvious....I wrote this to answer the question one person asked about what happened to Jennifer? What happened to her is the same malady that has afflicted and ruined many a hollywood starlet in the last 10 years....ANOREXIA.......it does more than ruin your shape and body, it destroys your face.....go watch one of her older movies, as an example, look at her in ""Picture Perfect"" and then look at her arms, and body and sorrowful face now, as in this movie.....it is a crying shame....but she has plenty of company here....I could go on all night comprising a list of these people....."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great !!",My husband and I rented this movie last night. We were in different parts of the video store but we both grabbed Derailed and we thought it would be a good movie after reading the back of the DVD case. We thought the movie started very slow to begin with. We almost turned it off. It got better as time went on and half-way through I had an idea as to what the twist was. I also did not care for the violence.I don't recommend renting Derailed. I'd wait until it comes on HBO and watch it late at night when there's nothing else to do.
4,The best x&y worst of Hollywood. A tribute to anti-heroes.,"A film which reaches unchartered depths of evil. The anti-prescription of the cliche 'trust no one'. The perilous pursuit of survival & possessions. These are some themes which are touched by this brave new film. If you thought Mel Gibson's & Gary Sinise's RANSOM or Wes Craven's SCREAM trilogy was twisted/ warped, think again. To infer the meaning of anti-hero is to conjure the image of the permanent polar opposite of Mel Gibson in His aforementioned film. Think of someone quite physically weak, dopey, unclear in vocal delivery...but the classic essence of bravery still shines through in the end. Sure it has plot holes; but where would the thrill joyride be in that? The film features Australian actress Melissa George, who along with Eric Bana in Speilberg's Munich, shows the strenth of the OZ culture calibre in acting with FINise & grace."
4,surprisingly good movie,"My husband and I really liked this one, it kept us guessing the whole way through and kept throwing in another twist. I also think what happened with the thieves taught the husband a lesson he will remember the next time he thinks about cheating on his wife and dying daughter. I dont see why other people thought the rape scene was so disturbing, the rape of Jodie Foster in The Accused was MUCH more graphic and horrifying. THAT one actually made me sick. ANyway this was a very entertaining movie, the only problem I have with it was I dont think the husband ever told his wife what he had done. He was not a likeable character and I dont see where he really cared about his family."
2,Not a good movie,"This is not a good movie--the surprise is not such a surprise. It should be easy to see coming when you aren't shown the backstories on major characters.Aniston is underused here. She hardly appears, so only diehard Aniston fans should watch, not lukewarm admirers."
2,"Dave's 10sec Review- nice maps, criminally bad SW","If you want 1:24,000 topographic maps of Oregon, or just about any other state, this is your only option. Too bad the software (Mac) is utter rubbish, criminally bad for a $100 product. User experience is inconsistent and often illogical, crashes, near-neglibile updates last few years, read the other reviews they're right.BUT if you want the maps you have to buy,just prepare for using it to make you cry."
3,Does not live up to the expectations,"This is a nice concept but the WWE did not get it right. In this DVD you will find 1-2 minute clips of matches from WM 1 - 9. It mainly focuses on Hogan, Savage and Warrior matches. If anyone saw the actual complete wrestlemanias they know of a lot more better matches. I found it annoying that the match clips were so short yet the Macho Man's promo was about 5 minutes. Give me a break. The WWE is ripping off their fans with this DVD. Lets see the WWE open the vault and release all of the Wrestlemanias in full instead of this DVD. Give up the goods Vince."
5,Beautiful Painting worth every penney,"I first saw this painting hung in a furniture store in California. Then, my daughter purchased it and I loved it. I knew I had to have it and it looks wonderful on my highwall over the formal dining area. Beautiful details. Wish the price was lower but it was worth it to me to buy it just the same."
3,Wasnt Impressed,First off the title is scary as hell. Second the book doesnt go deep in to help a person deal with hepatitis C. There's a small section on diet and that's all. Other book devote a whole chapter to the subject. There are better books out there.
1,"Decent balls, terrible bag","You'd think when they sold a product that weighs 30 lbs, that they would think to make the bag strong enough to hold it, but the seams are weak and the zipper is cheap. Zipper popped the first time I tried to pick up the bag from the top handle and the seams broke the first time I used the shoulder strap. Worthless."
1,"Pretty, but fragile","Attractive watch ... but one tiny scratch and the whole glass face shattered, after I'd only had it a couple of weeks. Very disappointing."
2,Cheap junk,"I wasn't expecting a lot and boy did it deliver. Buttons are mushy, and the scroll wheel is very cheap feeling and sounding. The cheap mouse that came with my bargain emachines pc was much better quality."
5,Nice Mouse!,"Clean, simple mouse that fits my hand just right. I actually thought I was buying a USB mouse, but that was my mistake, and I just used the PS/2 connection instead. Much nicer than the mouse that came with my PC!"
3,Seller didn't respond,I ordered this mouse without realizing it wasn't USB. I tried to return it but seller only does exchanges. I asked if was possible to exchange it to one with USB but NEVER replied... I wasted my money...
1,"Direct quote: ""Pure rubbish.""","Three Oingo Boingo band members have already commented elsewhere that this book contains more opinions and assumptions than actual fact, but it doesn't take that fact to notice it. Keith Breese skates through his mis-information and lack of simple research; filling in the blanks with his own imagination. He can't even keep low-level information, something as simple as dates, correct. Three quarters of the book is merely quoting other people's work, i.e. reviews and interviews. As one O.B. member said in an online review that is easily found, ""pure rubbish."" I think that says it all. It is no wonder why respectable publishers would print this; he had to print it himself through Xybris books (a pay-to-be-pulished outfit). The book itself is full of misspellings, bad typeography, misuse of quotations and punctuation, and is devoid of any form of proper grammar. Yes, you can say this isn't the pulp it was printed on, especially at this going price."
4,Have you read this book?,Gallagher is a former Peace Corps volunteer who spent two years in Thailand. As a consequence this book has many useful things to say in relation to overseas living. This book is quite practical given its short length and experience of the author. The strength of the book lies in Gallagher's experiences and his ability to use that in aiding the reader. Its biggest drawback is its datedness. This is especially true of the beginning and of the stereotypes portrayed in the first chapter. Although these things may still be true in the broadest sense the expat/native relationship has changed in the last 30 years. The book is also very American-centric in its comments and may not apply to others venturing overseas.Overall it's worth four stars for being short and sweet.
5,An exciting story; a unique voice,"This, the second novel in the series, contains Biggins' trademarks -- high humor, ingenious plotting, and (best of all) the wry, urbane voice of Biggins' protagonist, Otto Prohaska, a young Hapsburg naval officer. Looking back from the perspective of 75 years, Prohaska sardonically tells of the boredom of duty in the prewar Austrian navy, the absurdities of the Hapsburg court and the multinational, multilingual Hapsburg government, and the vicious twists and turns of Balkan politics. The novel culminates with a Keystone Kops execution scene that is almost as hilarious as the one in The Two-Headed Eagle, a scene that sums up the sense of existential futility with which suffuses The Emperor's Coloured Coat. This novel lacks only the tragic dimension, which the oncoming Great War will bring -- life will continue to be futile, but no longer boring, for Otto and his fellow Austrians.This book is a real treat. I enthusiastically recommend it."
3,Good for those who can't use their desk surface.,"I picked this up for my optical mouse. I'd been using the mouse for over a year without a mouse pad and it had begun to scuff the top of my desk. I bought the 3M Precise Mousing Surface to avoid scratching my desk further.The surface works ok but does not seem to be any more ""precise"" than my desk. It does protect my desktop, but this mouse pad occasionally slides across my desk when I'm moving the mouse. The mousing surface is thin which makes it relatively unobtrusive and makes up a bit for the fact that it moves sometimes. However, the colors/patterns that are available are not very attractive. Who wants a ""puddle of water"" on their desk, anyway?All in all I'd say it is not a bad solution if you need to protect your desk or if your desk surface is reflective and can't be used with an optical mouse. However, I can't recommend it for general use."
3,Beware of short,"Generally, I was satisfied with this bouncer. Buyers should be aware that the top portion (containing the lights) may have a short in it. Make sure to test immediately after receiving the bouncer, because it make take some time to get a replacement part from the manufacturer, who was actually, suprisingly, easy to deal with."
5,My grandson & daughter love it!!,"I bought this for my grandson who is almost 2 months old. He is somewhat spoiled and can be fussy at times :)... of course... but my daughter raves about the bouncer saying it's the best thing to calm him, so I would definitely recommend it."
4,My son loves this bouncer,"This bouncer has saved our lives when it comes to our 3 month old son. When he was born he was 6 lbs and we just put an infant head rest in the bouncer and that helped support him better. When he is fussy and waiting to eat, we place him in there and he has a grand ole time. He loves kicking and having the seat vibrate. I didn't use the attachment because the lights went so fast and the music was too loud. All in all I love this bouncer and my son enjoys it as well."
4,Baby loves it.,"Compared to the other PM products, this one seems to be more study. my 3 month old loves it. The only problem is the toybar. It already broke from prolonged use. When she pushes it for music, it plays the songs twice as fast as normal! You have to hold it back for the song to play at normal speed. She still loves the vibrations though."
1,DON'T recommend.,This was given to us for our son in our babyshower. Its not safe. Baby can go to the side and hurt baby seriously. I'd recoment going in person to the store cause you really need to feel and check the bouncers. I had a different one for out babygirl. That was great. Take along swing. That was great. Music and vibration modes soothed her to sleep.Martha NYC
2,Cute But Cheaply Made!!!,"I love Precous Moments and got this as a shower gift. Adorable - but my son HATED the music thing. I think it scared him - and to tell you the truth I was not crazy about it, either. It was loud and the lights were bright - with no way to adjust either. So, I took that off - and he LOVED sitting in the vibrating chair.... until the vibrator broke when he was 3 months old. We tried replacing the batteries - but the vibrator was shot! Should we be blessed with more children - this is definitely NOT something that can be used for them!"
4,Forensic Buff,"Enjoyed it but I could have done without it. But I can't pass up British mysteries,no matter who is in it."
4,Some Dynamic Acoustic Touches,Simon and Garfunkel contribute great songs and harmonies to this Sunds of Silence release. The title track is oh so haunting. The instrumental support is quite captivating in an understated way. Anji is dynamic guitar workout and spunky rhythms of We've Got A Groovy Thing Going are surely pleasing to the ear.Some people may settle on a compilation but Simon and Garfunkel bring too much to the table to bypass this release as well as several of their other original releases.
1,SLOW SHIPPING>> PRODUCT IS VERY WEAK.,Product was yellow/orange but had very little flavor.. Not good with popcorn or Mac N Cheese. Pass on this one.
4,Cheddar Cheese Powder,"I've used it several times in Mac & Cheese, had to guess amt to use as no instructions came with it, but is very similar to Kraft blue box----which my grandkids prefer over homemade! Go figure......:)"
1,DIRECTIONS for use,I've ordered other powdered products and they've always included DIRECTIONS FOR USE. This products leaves me clueless. I cannot find any information regarding contacting The Barry Farm ... can anyone help me out here? The reviews look wonderful.
5,Tasty!,This cheese has the best flavor of any that I have tried. The others have been too gritty or too salty. The best thing to do with this cheese is add it to the mac and cheese box mix. The kids absolutely love it. I will be ordering it again.
5,Packed with beautiful stories and full of ambience,I'm thoroughly enjoying this book! It is full of beautiful stories about the lifestyle and people of the intense Buddhist spiritual culture in Tibet in the last century. So many anecdotes bring the whole scene to life. The flavor of that whole world comes through so clearly. I'm not a Nyingma practitioner - so I'm not talking as a devoted student per se - but it's such a rich read and I'd recommend to anyone interested in Tibetan Buddhism.I've hardly read anything that gives the same depth of detail and cultural ambiance as this.
5,Quite a find,"Amazing book- a book that will really challenge the current paradigm's view on the world, with it's many amazing stories from a Buddhist culture and the individuals that lived within it.Highly recommended, especially for someone who has begun a Buddhist practice. It is very solidifying for your understanding of where actual Buddhist teachings fit into a real life.As a side note, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche was (fairly commonly) connected with both the Nyingma and Kagyu schools, and students of both (or neither, for that matter) can find much to gain from reading the book. There are amazing stories of great Nyingma teachers such as Chogyur Lingpa and his contemporaries as well as stories (first hand, often) about the 15th and 16th Karmapas."
4,JSA; book 7,I chose this rating because this is a very good story line which made this a very good read. put together well
5,Its a penny!,I paid a penny.. a penny is saving my lcd.. buy this.. it is a no brainer.. free your screen from wii's stupid motion controllers.
3,Ok strap,"This strap is strong and probably wont break, and matches my pink Wii remote well, but it doesnt have the clip to hold the size of your wrist in place like the original ones, so the wii remote could still fly off your wrist and break your tv, lets just hope that doesnt happen!!"
3,Same as teh picture,"Low cost product to customize your your Wii remote. I bought this for my girlfriend and that is why its a three star. Nothing completely great about it. Just what the picture shows.I recomend this product to any girl who likes the Wii and the color pink. It would make a great stoking stuffer. It is very easy to attach and looks and seems like it was made with decent quality, givin the price."
4,trainer bling,This plastic work of art does exactly what it is supposed to do however a phone book would do just as well and phone books are free. Get this if you had to buy the kinetic floor mat and need one more piece of kinetic equipment to match.
1,Get the Cyclops version instead,The riser ring is not sturdy enough to provide the support to hold the front wheel. Found the riser shifting and moving as I stood up to pound the pedals. The Cyclops riser is much sturdier and worth the extra money.
5,Good purchase,This device keeps the bike steady and level so you don't feel like you're leaning down too much when used with the Kinetic.
4,It works,"It works, but an old phone book works just as well. Give the phone book a try first and if you're not happy with it then go ahead and buy this."
3,Enjoyable,"Ever since I moved to Houston I have been interested in the work of South Houston Bible Institute (SHBI). This is the autobiography of the founder of that school. G. B. is the principle author of the book but the most enjoyable parts were written by his wife, Wilma. While G. B. gives a laborious accounting of his many preaching appointments through the years, Wilma (called Bill) adds a more personal touch. I found myself encouraged though reading the account of this wonderful family of faith."
3,Not too bad,I wasn't totally impressed. Seems a little thick. I only used it once and it really did nothing for me. The item arrived really fast but the seal was broken and half of the contents leaked out.
5,a house favorite,"We have used many lubes over the years, Astroglide, Wet, Id. This is by far our favorite. It has a mild tolerable flavor, it doesn't burn or numb sensitive body parts, and it stays wet when not overly exposed to air. This product is best for intercourse.CON: I can only say one bad thing. Transporting the pump is troublesome. There is a good chance the laughable sticker they use to hold the cap on will break and spill some of the lube out. It has been a while since I last ordered, so maybe they have fixed this.. maybe not. I did send them a note about it about 8 months ago."
5,Finally!,"Finally I have found a great lubricant that my body tolerates well! My boyfriend and I just love this stuff! It is worth the price and I like to buy it here now, as at my local shop they were always out of the product, or they were not carrying the product at that time. I only regret that the pump style does not travel well. The smaller size is better for travel."
3,careless vendor,Product was poorly packed. Seal was broken. Will order from different vendor in the future.
4,"A Ton of Fun, VERY SHORT.","An incredibly fun game. So easy to pick up and play through whenever you want.The game is very intuitive which adds to the lack of difficulty. Could use harder puzzles to offset the simple controls. Also the game is VERY short. Can be beat in as little as an hour (maybe less).There are a few items to collect throughout the levels, but they are easy to grab and do not add much to the game.In short, fun game."
4,"Great for kids, fun for adults, too!","I bought this game primarily for my 7 year old twins, and it didn't disappoint. They (and I) played for hours and we were thoroughly entertained.The somewhat limited 2nd player option is still enough fun to make it easier when you're waiting out your turn to take over the main controller again.It's challenging, but not so hard that my kids get frustrated while playing. The worst thing a ""kids"" video game can do is send them away mad because they get stuck, lost, or confused. This game, however, always keeps their attention.I had never heard of this game before seeing it on Amazon, but I'm glad I took a chance on it...and so are my kids."
2,STUPID .,"If you want a game that is frustrating, annoying, tiring, childish and plain boring buy this game ! The only time i liked to play it is when I was on the verge of dying from being bored. There is a stage ( I think it's called mirror something ) is really confusing . But if you do want a pointless no plot story go for Klonoa , but if you want a story worth your time get one of these titles. Any Final Fantasy game , any Fatal Frame game. I hope this was helpful to you ."
5,Tony at his best.,"I've owned this album since 1966. It's never sounded dated. Johnny Mandel's string scorings are the best. And the piano accompaniments of Tommy Flanagan (""Smile"") and Jimmy Rowles (""The Shadow of Your Smile"") are of the highest artistic merit. Larry Wilcox's arrangement of The Days of Wine and Rose is great as is Al Cohn's arangement of The Trolley Song. Quincy Jones's arrangements are the greatest, too.These are American Art Songs sung by a great interpreter of that genre. Buy it and enjoy it for the rest of your life."
4,Quicker than an Easy Up,"I practiced with this tent once. When it came time to actually use it, it went up fairly easy. I found the ""T"" door large enough to comfortably put our stuff inside and easy to use. We used two twin beds for sleeping (yes actual twin beds, bunk bed side by side.) with about 18"" in between. The side doors facilitated getting outof bed at night for bathroom runs. We had some gusty winds, we were not bothered though. And when it came time to tear down it went down as easy as it went up. The carry case is nice and roomy."
4,Easy to set up,"Directions lacked some visual ques, but other than that this tent went up with one person very quickly. It is HUGE inside and we had plenty of room. My son loved it and didn't want to take it down when we were done. It is very heavy once packed up though and bulky so be advised when packing the car or truck that this will take up a good amount of space."
2,Not easy for today's women to do...,"The ideas in this book are good so don't get me wrong...but I don't know how many women today could just sit back and smile and make happy while, for example, their husband is off with another woman waiting for him to see how much better things would be back at home. I believe the husband is the head of the household but I can't believe that God intends for a ""submissive wife"" to allow her husband that is committing adultry to continue to live in their house, sleep in their bed, and be an example for their children."
1,Bad Idea,"Buy Dr James Dobson's book, Love must be Tough and don't waste your money on this booklet. They shouldn't have paired them together, as their messages are completely opposite. I applied the advice from Love Must Be Tough and had success, doing what this book advised only brought me more heartache."
3,REceived wrong book,"I was unable to properly rate this book because I received the WRONG book. I had to click on a rating to continue with this review so you should disregard my rating since it was not for the book shown above). I received another book entitled ""les Chateaus de la Loire""....written in FRENCH! (It was not even the same book). I then emailed you and you contacted Owl Books. They did apologize and said that they will credit my account. I am not sure that it was an innocent mistake,Thank you,Suzanne Clark"
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge gargoyles fan, and have been waiting forever for the DVD sets to come out.I recieved the first and second season part one, for christmas and so far have been pretty disappointed with the first season.I don't know whether it's just MY copy of the dvd, but there seems to be a problem with the sound quality. The voices of the characters fade in and out, without good reason. (Like they will all be in the same place in a scene, its not like the sound is SUPPOSED to be ""far away"" sounding.. but it just cuts in and out)Also, the animation and the sound don't appear to be tied together.The animation lags the sound, and as you watch the episode it becomes more and more obvious.So far, overall, I have been quite disappointed. The sound issues make it really terrible to watch."
5,Exceptional,"After reading all the other review I really don't think I can add anything :)Gargoyles is by far the best thing to have come out of Disney/Buena Vista in a long long time. How many cartoons do you know of, that are just as popular a decade later, if not more?Perhaps ""cartoon"" does not correctly described this stunning animated action/drama, but then, it's hard to define perfection. The characters, the stories, the animation are all incredibly complex and compelling.Can't wait for the 2nd season to come out. Hopefully in one package so as not to prolong my suffering :)"
5,the hotness,"When people think of cartoons, they tend to assume that they're ""just for kids"". But that isn't the case sometimes, especially with this show - Gargoyles is much more than that.I think I can recall the show being listed in TV Guide as an Action Drama, which it is. I think what makes a show good is if it plays with a person's emotions, if it can really make you cry, laugh, sad, happy, etc. You can't really say that about most cartoons nowadays.The characters and storylines found in this series are just so awesome. Part of what makes it so cool is that the characters have real human emotions even if some of them aren't human.So, if you're looking for a great show that's not ""just for kids"", then be sure to pick up Gargoyles on DVD!"
5,A Gargoyles DVD at long last!,"'Gargoyles' was one of the few shows that Disney created that was meant for a more mature crowd. It had everything that anyone could want, from superb animation, exciting storylines that tied all the episodes together, guest voices (mostly from the Star Trek series), a mixture of themes from fantasy and romance, to comedy and sci-fi, and yet still somehow managed to tie it altogether."
5,a show that has never aged in its plethora of wonderful messages,"As a middle schooler, I would run home from the bus and turn on the TV to watch Gargoyles religiously and repeatedly. Rewatching the series as an adult allows me to acknowledge the fact that this show is superior to any other cartoon show. The themes of family, friendship, tolerance, duty, honor, etc. are prevalent on this show and the stories are incredibly compelling. The lessons this show taught kids - too much TV is never a good thing, respect your elders, etc. are timeless.Even with Pixar's incredible animation, Gargoyles is able to compete with their hand drawn, 2-D illustrations - the drawings are just that good.This is an incredible show and a must-see for adults even more so than for children."
5,Some of the best in animation...,"I've given this DVD set 5 stars even though we won't have it in our hands for 2 months. It only took ten years to have this show recognized and given the proper treatment it deserved, which includes all episodes uncut and as they originally aired. There haven't been many cartoons, or shows for that matter (animated or not) to come close to the scope of Gargoyles. The characters, animation, the history and neatly interweaving plotlines, incredible voice actors, the scope, the power and messages it conveyed has created a following that extended far beyond it's cancellation; even eight years later, people still celebrate it through art and fiction, an annual convention and a worldwide community of fans. And I know it's been a big part of my life and my imagination. Let's hope sales are high enough to warrant a season 2 release..."
1,"Hugrs 50""ball","Santa brought this ball to my children this Christmas to replace the Bigens ball they had for years - which died of old age. This Hugrs ball was a complete waste of money. It bounced against a bush the first visit outside and was ripped apart.Our old Bigens, which I can no longer find, lived in our yard, through extreme heat and frequent cold temperatures for years, and was a delight to my kids. I would NOT recommend this for children and/or outside use."
5,big green ball,"I would highly recommend this seller, the product was perfect and I received it in a very timely manner. I have given the link to two of my horsey friends who are also ordering.Thanks for a very satisfactory business deal."
2,i dont recommend this book,It's a bit dated and it's really just a song book. It doesn't offer much of the way in instruction. I recommend L.E. McCullough over this book.
1,poor coating,"I agree with a previous review,coating does not hold up. Comes off if bumped to hard.has been used gently and the metal is already showing. One thing I would like to know is, what is the highest temp this coating will tolerate."
3,Limited lifespan--but not that limited,"As noted in other reviews, this whisk seems to have the best of both worlds: metal strength and flexibility, silicone non-scratchability. The problem is, as some reviewers noted, that after a while the silicone breaks and the metal becomes exposed. Once that happens you may start scratching your pans, but perhaps worse, where the silicone coating is cracked, muck may check in but won't check out, to paraphrase Alton B.Still, while it lasts it is an excellent tool, and I have to say that mine has lasted for almost two years now. Sure it is time to throw it out, but considering its two years of probably daily use (and heavy-duty use at that--steel-cut oats!) this hasn't been such a bad buy for me. I'll look into that Le Creuset whisk, it'll go great with my Dutch ovens, but if it's priced like other LC products I'm just getting me another one of these."
2,Teri Jory: Poise Fitness Core Training,"I was not impressed with this DVD. There was no martial arts as described, very little dance (only a ballet bar was used very briefly)and it was very slow. I do not feel as though this DVD was challenging whatsoever and it was just too brief. I did not like it at all. I thought this DVD would really push me to the next level, but it was very boring and not challenging at all. Also, the camera views made it impossible to see the position of the models feet during the ballet bar portion...who has a ballet bar anyway? Even if you use a sink or chair as she suggests it is very hard to do this without being able to see how their feet are positioned."
4,Great toy organizer!,This organizer is a great way to keep toys off the floor. Now that she can see all of her the toys she actually wants to play with them! I just wish it had more capacity.
3,"Liked the colors, but thin/flimsy bins!!","I really wanted a storage organizer that would work for both my son and daughter, and I preferred the white frame but all the white framed storage organizers were targeted for girls. This one worked perfectly as it a mix of pink/purple and green/blue bins. However, we ended up returning this unit because there were 2 cracked bins. The bins are SO extremely thin and flimsy. Cheap quality compared to Honey-Can-Do's similar storage bin organizer. Honey-Can-Do's are the same price and the bins are thicker and sturdier. I give this produce 3 stars because of the versatile color scheme."
5,Great Organizer and Service,"We purchased this for our son and found it was everything it claims to be. Additionally, one of the buckets in the box was broken when we received it, and we contacted Tot Tutors' customer support and requested a replacement. their service was great, courteous, and prompt. One of our biggest concerns with online shopping is what to do when damaged goods are received, but these guys were great!"
4,Great organizer for kids,"I purchased this for my pre-school aged twins. We were struggling with Lego pieces, building blocks etc. covering their bedroom floor. This piece was easy to construct and it looks great in their room. The best part is that I can walk into their room and see the carpet now."
4,Great for all those little toys,"We have had this toy shelf for quite awhile now and thank goodness. It helps to keep all those little balls, blocks and small stuff animals off the floor. So far it seems pretty durable. We attached the anchor strap to the wall and my daughter tugs and leans on the shelf with no problems. The one thing she does have a hard time with is when she wants to remove one container from any shelf other than the top she has a hard time and gets really frustrated. This usually leads to all of the bins above it coming out and toys strewn every where. Other than that though a great investment."
5,Worth the money,Easy to put together. Works as it should. Teaches organizational skills. Keeps the million of small toys in there correct places. My Toddler can now play and organise at the same time. Clean up is easy. A little wobbly but that doesnt bother me. Easy for my toddler(2) to reach all toys. Glad i went ahead a bought this.
5,Awesome toy organizer,"Love this toy organizer. There are several on the market which are this same basic design and size, but this one sold me because of the bright colors. I love that they are a bit brighter than the usual pastel option for girls. I have a 3.5 year old girl and she has some things in her room which are brighter so this blends nicely with all of it. Also if we have a boy eventually it will work for him too. I disagree with some of the reviews which stated that the bins are too small to really hold anything. They are perfect for what I wanted. We have a large toy box which holds the bigger toys, but often the smaller toys and sets get lost in them. Some examples of items we have in this organizer are a Mr. Potato head with its accessories, a ""Littlest Pet Shop"" set, a baby alive with the accessories, and those are just the things that fit in the small bins. Very glad I made this choice. Would recommend!"
5,Worth every penny!!!,"It looks so cute in my son's room, but more importantly its funtional, very sturdy, and extremely easy to assemble. My son now plays with all of his toys because he can see them versus them being buried on top of each other in a bin. Worth every penny!!!"
1,Toy organizer that actually keeps toy unorganized.,Horrible. Cheaply made bins; unstable frame. And the fact that the bins should be kept at a tilt just causes little ones to make more mess (plus the bins are very small in size). Look for something else. I returned this junk and bought the Little Tikes toy chest and absolutely love it.Little Tikes Primary Colors Toy Chest
3,"Not Correct ""Sound of Silence"" melody","The original record (not CD) version of this album had their first version of their signature ""Sound of Silence"". This was replaced in time by the more familiar version of the tune that appears in all their subsequent albums. However it is very wrong that the ""Pressers"" of this CD did not use the same tune as on the original record. Or better yet - include the more familiar version as a bonus track. The two versions have identical words but very very different melodies.Except for that the album is 4 stars ****"
2,Definitely Their Weakest Album,"Simon And Garfunkel were an unrivaled pair. Their divine vocal harmonies and brilliant songwriting have never been surpassed. This, their debut, is the only weak album they ever made.There are only three good songs on here: ""You Can Tell The World"" (I usually don't care for country music but this is an awesome song), ""Sparrow"" (the song that introduces their aforementioned divine vocal harmonies) and the original acoustic version of ""The Sound Of Silence"". The rest of the album is rather boring.Thankfully, though, all their other albums would prove to be sheer masterpieces."
3,Album that failed to sell until their later efforts became popular,"Simon & Garfunkel/ Wednesday Morning, 3 AM: This is very much a Greenwich Village folk album. Despite having ""The sounds of silence"" (Their first version of the song), this album fell flat and disappeared until after the duo hit the big-time with their subsequent efforts. At the time, however, Simon was so discouraged by the lack of recognition that he almost quit the business. Thankfully, the business did not quit them and they returned with their classic recordings. This is not to say that there are no good tunes here, there are, but this is a less than satisfying effort. The bonus tracks that appear on this most recent CD add little to the albums reputation."
2,Different,"Keith Jarrett is an excellent piano player, but since this recording was a Carnegie Hall Concert, it wasn't what I expected. I personally didn't care for the selections on the recording. MaryLou Hall"
1,Carnegie Hall Concert,I don't know why some people enjoy this music. Only one piece did appeal to me and that was one of the last on the CD. The music fits dissonance notes and rhythms harse on the ear. I have given the CD to Good Will Store.
3,Flawed post production,"The audience at the concert was enthusiastic. Unfortunately, whoever put the CD together let the applause at the end of each track overwhelm the music. It's nice to have a concert recording and to get a sense of the audience's reaction, but it's terribly jarring to hear a piece that diminishes to a fine point and suddenly be overwhelmed with a blast of essentially white noise from the audience. After importing the CDs to iTunes, I used Audacity (free software) to take out the applause from each track. Looking at Audacity's display of the waveform made it clear how much more intense the applause was compared to the music. The producers could have done a much better job of creating a CD that was a pleasure to listen to musically.Others have commented on the music itself, and I think I'll enjoy listening to it many times over ... now that I've fixed my copy!(Review composed while listening to the Köln Concert, so I'm in a better mood now.)"
5,Best BBQ Sauce - My favorite!,"Have been to Rendezvous in Memphis several times and have decided that this is my very favorite sauce, hands down. I like the regular and the Hot, along with the rub. Born and raised in the South, lived in Texas for a while, and have been eating delicious BBQ all my life. I was partial to a sweeter sauce until I met Rendezvous. Give it a try - you won't be disappointed! And be sure to visit the restaurant in Memphis - it's a real winner!"
3,"A noted perspective, but why stop there?","Without an understanding of the human experience in the world, our perception is blurred, quite literally it often seems. Sewell explains how our visual and spiritual sight is dulled by modernities and uses this thesis to place human relations to all things. I found her view to be thorough but her exploration limited. What about the other senses? Further, Sewell's mandate for how we treat our environment is appropriate, and she often refers to tribal people, but not once does she refer to the tribal experience. In fact, her lessons are often about the individual experience in nature, as a way to achieve a visionary experience, and I wonder how it is tribal people related to nature: as individuals or as a tribe? Yes, we are fragmented with our surroundings, but with each other as well."
1,Doesn't work!!!,I applied this stuff 3x on our rug and despite that my dog's pee stain didn't come out. We bought it b/c we have a puppy that's being potty trained and soon after I sprayed it we tried to use carpet stain remover and my dog's pee still wouldn't come out. If I were you I'd try to have your carpets and rugs professionally scotchguarded. Don't buy this product. I had to buy 2 cuz 1 can wasn't enough for our 9' x 13' rug. Oh yeah! On top of that it felt like the shipping took forever.
5,"Interesting, informative, and readable.","I absolutely loved reading this book. I actually found it more enjoyable than ""Memoirs of a Geisha"". Although it can look a bit intimidating at first, Geisha is actually a very readable and very enjoyable. That fact that it is in a sense a memoir as well as a book about geisha is definatley a plus. I would recomend this to anyone who is interested in geisha and Japan, and also to anyone wanting to be better informed asbout the world as a whole."
2,Spoiled by the author's conceit,"The book's cover says that Liza Dalby is the only foreigner ever to have become an actual geisha', but she was never an actual geisha. Dalby didn't undergo the rigourous training necessary to become a fully qualified geisha, she wasn't ever a registered geisha, and claiming on the cover of the book that she was a geisha is blatant misrepresentation. It takes a lot more than a powdered face and following actual geisha about to become a geisha, and claiming otherwise is so unfair to the women who really do train hard and earn the name. In addition, Dalby is way too impressed with herself for the book to be enjoyable."
1,Allergic reaction anyone?,"Less than ten minutes after swallowing a piece of the mysterious Odwalla bar, I was covered in a red rash, my ears burned, and I felt a tingle over my whole body. Even if I did not have the reaction this bar still tastes terrible (imagine horse grain and dirt). Do not buy OR try."
3,3M Self-Stick Bulletin Board,"The product was a bit pricey for what it is, and it was a bit of a chore to get all the little self-release tabs in the right place and the whole thing lined up right. But it was no more expensive here than at the brick and stick stores, and once installed over my desk does a lovely job. So all in all worth money, time, and effort."
1,DON'T buy this via the mail!,"You cannot believe the shape this flimsy stuff showed up in! It had been folded, bent and mutilated beyond belief. The cardboard support for the product in the package provided no protection at all.Why the seller thought this would arrive ANYWHERE in usable shape is beyond me. Headed for the nearest Staples . . .Avoid!"
2,Received it partially destroyed by poor shipping,I ordered this thinking that I would apply it over the cork bulletin board that I already had up. The item was shipped without any shipping protection and I received it bent and partially destroyed by shipping. On the bright side the seller refunded my money immediately.
5,"Lovely verses, my grandchildren love.",I use this classic book for a birthday book for my grandchildren. It is fun for them to each see their month and the season of their birthday. It makes a good present to new parents or grandparents too.
2,Fan problem,"I have been using this laptop for the past 2 years. It has great features that i haven't seen on many laptop. However, I believe that Acer has a serious problem with their fans. In my case, the fan only start running when it is already too hot and then shuts down. I can only use my laptop in a cold room with a big external fan blowing on it. Trrible. I have research about this problem and noticed that a lot of users have similar problems or opposite problem with a fan that is always on full blush even if not needed. This make this laptop mediocre and it is irratating to think that Acer could probably fix that issues, but nothing is done and nothing is recommended. I cannot recommend this laptop to anyone."
1,A Blur of Sound,"The recent remastering (March, 2002) of this five-star album reduces it to a one-star blur with Ms. Streisand's glorious voice sounding like it is coming from a record played with a blunt needle. Shame on however calls this thing a ""remastering."" The previous release was so much clearer and much more listenable."
3,A portrayal of the destruction of Hawaiian culture by the modern world,"This is a rather tragic story of the loss of old Hawaiian culture as Western civilization encroached upon & then dismantled the traditional way -- and the inability of the aristocracy of Hawaii to preserve their ways. The books is somewhat dated in outlook and unashamedly pro-Hawaiian, but falls short of giving a really insightful and penetrating portrayal of Liliuokalani, a great lady."
3,NorthStar,"Was disappointed, it was not as bright as my Duel Fuel Powerhouse doulbe mantal. only 1143 lumens, still trying to fine out my power house lumens"
1,picture is not the same as model number,"I purchased these floor mats based on the picture Amazon has posted and received them today. They are not the same mats in the picture!!!The model number 52011 is what I received and when I went to Huskyliners.com and discovered that the model numbers match the item that I received but it's not what I thought I was buying. Now I have to contact Amazon and try to get this fixed. What a real dissapointment and a royal pain in the arse! I would rate the quality of the product as 5 star, excellent which is why I took the time, made an effeort to buy American but Amazon has some explaining to do.Buyer beware!"
2,Not for anyone who wants to get serious with Linux,"This was my first book on the subject and i could definately have found a better book. The title ""Teach yourself linux"" couldn't be more true, you need to teach yourself Linux because this book wont be much of a help. The authors don't go deep at all, just scratching the surface, not explaining much. Important things as the installation process, the structure of the system, and some bits here and there are written poorly and will almost definately leave a beginner helpless. As the authors say, this book is for a beginner but in my opinion it's a bit too confusing for a beginner.Don't buy this book if you want to get serious with Linux, there are far better books out there.The Red Hat CD + RPM-packages CD and a useful section about text-editing barely makes this book a two star."
5,EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF TASTY DO-ABLE MEALS,"I love this cookbook. I have lots of them, and this is one of my very favorites. I made the WW Stuffed Turkey breast for Thanksgiving this past year...everyone loved it. And my family usually turns their noses up at anything lowfat or good for you. But that is what is so great about this book...you would never know some of these recipes are diet..no sacrificing taste here."
4,acn,"one of the few cookbooks that i routinely use.very helpful with maintaining weight control. have recommended to friends ,who have also purchased through me , and they too agree. its a great cookbook."
3,maysgrm,"I was a little disappointed in this recipe book. The recipies require so many ingredients that I never seem to have in the house -- not common household spices. So no matter what I make, it requires a shopping trip to town to get everything. Also, most of the recipies take extensive preparation time. However, the recipies I have tried are good."
2,Bland,"The recipes are easy to follow and the book is well-organized, but the dishes are B-L-A-N-D. I know this is low-fat cooking, but a good recipe is supposed to fool you - these don't. I say stick to the real butter and whole milk and just eat in moderation - enjoy your life!"
1,rice pudding with golden raisins,your recipe for rice pudding sucks. dont you test these recipes before you print them.
5,This Is A Must For LaBouche Fans!,This single is fantastic! It's a MUST for all Melanie's fans also check out the full length CD Ready To Fly it GREAT..
4,He's a Genius in France,"It's a ""G""-rated idiotic trip to France with Mr. Bean and a camcorder. The restaurant scene was particularly wonderful. Oysters are always funny, but these were especially well-played. It's a giggle, and worth a view.Now Jerry Lewis won't be the only comic ""Genius in France""....."
3,BETTER,THis movie started out typical BEAN (2 stars) and grew into something more. I would almost give it 4 stars (ending in a grand MGM style)
5,The best bean ever,"This is the best Bean ever made. It is a very special, beautiful roadmovie, it makes you smile, giggle and laugh, it touches your heart, it makes you admire its beauty... it is slapstick with romance... it is romance with humor... it is great cinema. Rowan Atkinson is better than ever, his Mr. Bean has reached the Olympus of art. Peter Sellers, Sir Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton will love him. But... Mr. Bean is alive and well.Thank you, Rown Atkinson!Thank you gvery much for this great movie!Walter(Walter-Joerg Langbein)"
5,Lots of laughs,Great movie to watch with the family. Lots of laughs and funny scenes that only Mr Bean could carry out.
3,Beanman,"This has a reasonably decent story but it leans more to drama than comedy. That is not to say it doesn't have plenty of funny moments, it just isn't all out crazy like his other movies. When he wins a holiday and asks for assistance at a train terminal he accidentally separates a father from his son. His mission to see they are reunited is dramatic and comedic throughout. I didn't find myself laughing as much and my wife got bored with it promptly. A good rental but see it before buying it to make sure it suits your taste. Good quality DVD with several extras including deleted scenes. To me it has zero replay."
1,Boooo,I thought I was getting all of the Mr. Bean shows. What I got was mostly cartoons. Terribly disappointed. This was not clearly stated on the explanation of the content.
3,dvd cover,The cover of the dvd was water damaged. This was not mentioned in the description when I bought the item.
2,"nice lens, bas customer service","The lens I recieved is wonderful. The only problem was that it did not come with the adapter ring to fit my camera (S9100). The adapter must go to some other model. I called customer service in New York and they told me to call back the next day, as the man answering the phone didn't know what to do. Same thing the next day. I ended up buying the adapter at a local store. The lens its self though takes wonderful pictures. Its just 47th street photos customer service that sucks."
2,No cigar for this one,"""Covers"" is the key word here. Most of this so-called Hi NRG has signs of tired blood. Amazon has far better Hi NRG collections than this one, keep looking."
5,MY First Raggedy Ann Books!,"Here's another set of books I grew up with. I owned all of the Raggedy Ann books listed here except the Nice Policeman. All of them were my mother's books before me. They are truly wonderful books for little girls and boys to read, with lively illustrations in bright colors perfect for little eyes to enjoy. The stories are sweet and full of adventure, but still teach good lessons to young readers. These are among the timeless classics that children from any generation will love."
3,Poor quality,I purchased this book with the intentions on giving it as a gift for Christmas. I received well ahead of time but unfortunatly the book jacket is worn as if it is used. Not very happy with the receiving this product in poor condition.
2,Bulky & Heavy,"As a frequent user of crutches due to a disability I purchased these for travel because they fold. These crutches are going into a closet and will not be returning. Comparing to the standard under the arm crutches these are bulky and heavy. Each crutch is specific for left hand or right hand which makes it a pain when you pick them up and need to figure out which one goes with which arm. After 5 months of use the springs on the bottom section are squeaking and make noise. They are getting loud. When your using crutches people already watch as you walk by, when you add the loudness of the crutches people hear your coming from a lot further away and larger radius."
5,Very good product,I bought these crutches about 10 days ago and they work very well. I will be using them for at least another 7 weeks. I really like the fact that they fold up and the spring action makes walking easier.I had a small problem with them and I called the company and they were very nice and send out the new part in only a couple days. I highly recommend these cruthches.
2,Review of the Millenial Crutch,"I recently broke my ankle and brought this item. Exactly after 20 days of usage, one of the handles broke. And after 2 more days even the other one broke. Overall, this looks as if its a very delicate item. Please donot think Im fat. I just weigh 170 pounds and thinner than most of the guys."
4,"The Andy Williams Christmas Album,Volume 2","THE ANDY WILLIAMS CHRISTMAS ALBUM was a bonafide megahit. It must have sold about 2 billion copies in its 41 years on the market. On MERRY CHRISTMAS,Williams gives his fans twelve more holiday favorites such as SLEIGH RIDE,HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS,WINTER WONDERLAND,SILVER BELLS,MY FAVORITE THINGS and LET IT SNOW,LET IT SNOW,LET IT SNOW!(personally,I think the two repeats in the latter title are unnecessary). This album was originally released in 1965 in both mono and stereo. Over the years,Williams has done several Christmas specials for television. All the other songs are good."
5,So actual!,"No need to praise Arthur Clarke, it goes without saying. The man was a genius and every book he wrote was a masterpiece. What is very worth saying about ""The Trigger"" is that this book, that deals with gun violence, is SO actual as if it has been written today, relating to the recent debate about gun control. Clarke's position is so beautifully put that it should be used as argument today in the battle to control guns. MUST READ!!"
4,Are science and disarmament obvious choices?,"Master author Arthur C. Clarke and Michael Kube-McDowell have joined forces and conceived a novel set in the not too distant future. Scientists have discovered the ultimate anti-weapon and mankind can finally hope for a pacifist future. Surely that is the best thing to happen to mankind, isn't it? Not so fast Colonel. The Trigger explores and chronicles a fictional `what if' scenario where the right wing US gun lobby, the military, think tanks, politicians and corporations jockey for position determined to affect the outcome of a new and emerging paradigm."
5,Best Sales Book,"As a professional salesperson, sales manager, and CEO with over 25 years of experience and previously one of the top 5% of salespeople in a Fortune 500 corporation, I have attended practically every sales seminar offered and read every book that I could get my hands on. This book is a classic. It is the best book written for salespeople that have to sell a concept that is more complex than an impulse item. I use it for training all our new sales people and highly recommend it."
3,Understanding the needs of Bigger Customers,SPIN Selling makes a compelling case against agressive selling techniques and closing catchphrases.It underlines the proccess that big account representatives must follow to understand and act on the needs of the customers.Although it is great for complex value offerings it also states clearly that basic closing techniques are the most appropiate for fast selling basic products.On the downside the book expands too much on the statistics behind the model and try to fill space with the same info in another context.
3,"Given the subject's limitations, as good as it gets!","Having some knowledge of the subject, I am of the mind that selling is next to impossible to teach, learn and predict. This may raise eyebrows, but let's deal in veracity, shall we?Man has not invented or perfected the science which can predict human behaviour, reaction or rsponse. Psychologists and sociologists may well be the first to tell you so.Given this context, no text can claim to have mastered the art of selling - it just is not a possibility.Having said that, SPIN Selling does as good a job as any; having researched and field-tested its recommendations and results. That is as good as it will ever get - and yet, as mentioned earlier, there are no guarantees.As such, I admire the book for being best-of-breed, but have to believe that neither this nor any other method will come close to covering it all or covering it precisely."
4,Therion is slowly becoming a monster Classical group,"The other reviews are fairly accurate, but the one thing to note on this album is that Therion is going even further in the classical direction. More operatic vocals, more orchestral interludes, but a little less metal as well. If they keep going this way, they'll be a full blown Symphonic Orchestra in another couple releases, but with interesting classical music! If you want pure chunking guitars with operatic and classical tendencies, get Theli or Vovin. If you want Opera and Classical with some chunking guitars, get Deggial. Still love 'em."
3,OK,It works but it has lots of holes in it and if you actually want to cook with it you need to wrap it in tinfoil.
3,Camp Oven,"Patience is the key to this product. First get you a good oven thermometer and place in the center of the oven and turn on the gas. Let the oven heat for at least 15 min. Check the temperature on the out side thermometer and then check the inside. Create a ratio. Example: when the outside thermometer reads 225 degrees the inside is 350 degrees, so when I want a 350 degree oven I hold the outside temperature to 225 degrees."
5,sweetwater rocks,"Well, Ann Arbor is hardly at ""the foot of Lake Erie..."" as the Product Description so confidently puts it, but no matter. This band gets it right on every song. There's more to write about (and sing about) in this incredible region than the folks in New Yuck, New Yuck, could imagine. Can't wait for the new CD."
2,"Occasionally insightful, mostly incomprehensible","This reminds me a lot of my journals and songs from about age 15-23. That's in no way saying that Serj is an angsty teen-ager, just that it was probably very satisfying to write it and I'm sure it makes sense to him, but probably not to many others. There's a brilliant comprehensible line here and there, but much of it almost seems like automatic writing with a little bit of word play added. The closest thing I can compare it to is Burroughs. If you enjoy digging through the non-sense to get to the gems of thought, check this out. It makes good bathroom reading. OR if you're into psychedelic drugs it may also make much more sense, until you're down again that is. Long live System of a Down! Keep fighting the ""good"" fight Serj."
4,Excellent Taste and Aroma,"This tea is great. I love Earl Grey, and this tea does exemplify the bold flavor. Only issue was the extra strong orange taste, though I know that is part of Earl Grey, it was too much."
2,Author has shortage of vocabulary,"The story could be interesting, if not for the obnoxious overuse of the word derision and all it's forms! For example: ""She challengingly withstood the derision..."", ""Brice realized derisively"", ""... she mused derisively"", etc. The author doesn't seem to know how to find her thesaurus to look up synonyms or to just leave the word out and describe more body language instead. The author used the word on nearly every other page. It was distracting my attention away from the anticipation of where the story was going and how the chemistry of the characters was played out. The editors really should have caught this, unless, of course, it was their fault the word was so abused."
3,Quality could be better but.................,"Kevin's voice is sounding more and more forced, almost like he's trying to hard. I can't believe he could've blown out his voice, but it just doesn't sound right. However, the music on this CD is good. If you're a true REO fan, I'd get it. Kevin's vocals are just so much a part of REO music though, so I can only give it 3 stars."
4,Little Tikes DiscoverSounds Tool Box,"The toy itself is wonderful for toddlers. My grandson wouldn't open anything else on Christmas morning after he saw this one. I like the fact that it has a toolbox theme as my 14-month-old grandson loves to ""help"" his dad fix things. It is just the right size and weight for a little one to carry around. The shape sorter is built into the ""toolbox"", so the shapes stay inside the box and are not as likely to get lost.The only thing that doesn't seem to fit is the ""DiscoverSounds"" part of the title. It lights up and makes sounds when the shapes go through, but, other than that, there is nothing to ""Discover"" about the sounds."
1,disappointing,It was kind of awful; bunch of songs I never heard; don't think it was digitally remastered. I think I ordered it by mistake actually
3,cattrap,"when i recieved this product it was all bent i had to straighten it to be able to use it. it was not a carrier damage,it was sent damaged,i will not buy from this company again."
4,Works great! Excellent!,"Works and caught two possums in my garage, and easy to store away when not needed. Priced higher than I would like, but works great!"
5,Great trap...but be forewarned,This trap did its job perfectly on the first night trying to trap a pesky raccoon. I used crumbled bacon and at 4am I awoke to a HUGE (even the animal control guy was shocked by the size) raccoon shaking the cage trying to escape. What I wasn't prepared for was the huge mess the raccoon created! Fecal matter everywhere...pee everywhere...and shredded cardboard everywhere(I hid the cage under a cardboard box not knowing the raccoon would be able to reach through the cage and shred it. Don't forget to check with your state's Dept. of Natural Resources before trapping (you need a permit in MD and many other states). I really felt bad for the raccoon but I am happy not to have him waking me up every night trying to rip my trash cans to shreds to get inside.
5,This works 100%!!!!,"We had bought many products to deter a nuisance cat that used our flower-bed for nature's calls. We spent money on electronic deterrent, various sprays etc without much success. We recently bought this product and on the very first night....bingo!!! We caught the animal with ease."
5,it works,I used this trap to relocate 5 very distructive racoons with good success. One was especially large but the trap was up to the task. I recommend this product.
4,Works Great! But a little flimsy!,"I was able to catch 2 stray cats the first week that I got it. So it works as advertised, but the build quality of it is not so great. It felt flimsy when trying to transport the 2 cats that I caught."
1,escape risk,"The trapped raccoon was able to bend this cage and escape, leaving a bloody trail. The animal was injured by this ineffective product."
1,WORKED UNTIL.....,"Had a stray coming through my doggie door and eating all my cat's food and pissing on my furniture, so when my new trap showed up I put it right to work. Followed the instructions for assembly and grabbed a can of tuna. Within 15 minutes, BAM! I had a trapped cat. That was too easy. Picked up the occupied trap and the cat started hissing and spitting at me. But, then when I started carrying him to my truck for a 10 mile ride to a new home, he started charging both ends of the the trap. I set the trap down to calm him down, when all of a sudden...it happened!!! He charged the door end of the trap hard and...HE WAS FREE AND RUNNING. WTF! That's not supposed to happen! I had that sucker and now he's gone for good. He'll never go back in that thing again. I want my money back!!!"
2,latch problems,"The Havahart trap looks like it should work well, however the hook & latch assembly for keeping the door open didn't line up properly, & was at least 1/2"" from being able to be latched (used at all) & I had to have a friend use pliers to bend the 2 parts so they would connect properly. I made no mistakes in assembly, & nothing in the assembly could have been adjusted any differently, so I don't know why it didn't allign properly. It was so big & cumbersome I didn't want to disassemble & return it, & figured ""jury rigging"" it would be the best option. Haven't had a chance to use it yet. Out to trap neighbor cats stalking & killing birds at my feeder & birdbath (to return them to their owners with a warning, Humane Society would be their next drop off point). I have also had a skunk visitor, but if I trap him, then what???"
5,Havahart Trap,"This trap is well made and does exactly as it says. The trigger is definitely sensitive so beware! I bought it to catch a feral cat in my area and I put little amounts of food leading into the trap and sure enough, I caught her! Getting her spayed...The quality is much greater than the cost. The cost is extremely reasonable."
1,Broke after 4 months,This bracelet is made very cheap. I was careful with it but it broke after about 4 months and then it was too late to return it. I am stuck with a piece of junk.
4,This will tell you why the Iron Curtain fell,"The Soviet Union is history; it evaporated in just a few years, to the surprise of many.Not everyone was surprised. Mr. Todd, a French historian, was not -- nor were those who have read this book.Todd realized you had to analyze the S.U. in the same way as empires of the past -- places you cannot talk to, and whose records are incomplete and unreliable. And he examined the entire Soviet empire -- including its vassal states of Eastern Europe.I won't try to summarize the whole book here. Suffice it to say that he describes why the Soviet Union was unstable, and what the causes of its downfall are.Not everything carries over to the few remaining communist states, but some of it does. So this book will help you understand China, too."
1,HP BT450 Bleutooth Adapter,I have been unable to get this product to function between a new fully-loaded SONY VAIO laptop with VISTA and an HP 7410 All-in-One Printer.The installation instructions were useless/non-existent.HP Support via the phone was useless (they only wanted me to buy a new printer) and the HP web site could not help.
1,PIECE OF CRAP Customer SERVICE!!!!,"I don't mean the adapter, it works fine, I am talking about the customer service, they SUCK!! The girl I just spoke to was a complete IDIOT!! Did NOT know a thing about what the hell she was talking about, this is a bunch of bull!! All I want to know is if this adapter is A2DP compatible and I cannot find my answer anywhere on the net!!!!!!!! I give the adapter a 4 because it actually works with my computer and did NOT give me any problems, but because of the sucky customer service, I am giving HP over all a flippin 1"
2,"It works, but it is slow",It was very easy to plug in and tell my iMAC to find it. If there is any color other that black or a photo on the page being printed it will take a few minutes to print.
2,Stopped Working After HP Software Update,This was working fine until last week. I can not print after downloading a HP printer upgrade. I am using a MacBook Pro with OSX 10.8.2. laptop. My printer is an Officejet Pro L7680 All in One.I may contact HP to see if they can determine if their recent software upgrade is the problem. For a while I thought it may have just stopped working from age (used since 2009) and that may still be the case. I do not know. The printer recognizes other commands using the bt450 but will not print.I am giving it 2 stars for now: not working. Until it stopped working I would give it 4 stars. It had good range. I could print from almost everywhere in the house and my house footprint is large with 2 levels including a basement.
1,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I bought this so I could print wireless from my laptop, it didn't work. I called Hp tech support and after 45 min they couldn't get it to work either and explained I would only be able to print not use bidirectional scanning from the printer to scanner and suggested I return it. I bought it through amazon but it was shipped from Tech Depot an affiliated company of Office Depot and they said since I opened it that I could not return it. How was I supposed to know it wouldn't work without opening, I won't shop from office depot or Tech depot again."
1,Don't waste your money - it doesn't work,"I have an HP Photosmart 8450 printer that is bluetooth capable with the HP bt300 bluetooth wireless adapter. However, that particular adapter is no longer available, so HP told me I could use the bt450. NOT!! I purchased and returned 2 of them. My computer 'saw' my printer for about 20 seconds - that's it. After that it was no longer visible. I tried everything - including making a ton of changes to my system (as told to me by a couple of their techs), only to have had my entire system just freeze up. Thank goodness for system restore. HP is too proprietary with their products. They just don't like to ""play nice"" with other manufacturer's products. I won't purchase any more HP products. Their technical dept. was not helpful at all! Buyers beware."
5,A little too close for comfort! Scary!,"I love a good political thriller, but boy did this one have an eerie feeling of reality to it, given the 2000 election, the Patriot Act and other abuses of the current Administration. But the book really works so beautifully because the author understands how to make the characterizations realistic and true. This is a gripping read, and a wonderful work of speculative fiction that comes a little too close to America's current reality. You'll stay up nights worrying about all this, if you're not careful. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Okay Book,I did not enjoy this book too much since it was a little over-the-top. It also failed to keep my interest. The first Voo Doo book I read by Ms Bond was much better. I was just a little disappointed in it.
2,Disappointed,"I picked this book up because of the ""humorous mystery"" tag attached to it. A quarter of the way thru I was hooked and ordered the next in the series. Three quarters of the way thru I cancelled my order of the second book and just skimmed to the end of the book disgusted. It just dropped me flat and did not deliver what it promised from the beginning. Where was the humor? And the resolution of the whole mystery just made me feel as if my time had been wasted. This is the second book I have read by this author and I don't think there will be a third. I'm sorry - this is one book that did not leave me at the end with a feeling of time well spent."
1,Don't Bother,It's loud and noisy. They changed the massager that didn't need changing. I owned two Acuvibe's before this one and they've just lost my business.
4,Excellent electro,"Neotek has put together some excellent electro on this disc! Unfortunately, many people seem to have missed it completely."
5,Gift for Husband,My husband said this is even better than Zell's previous book. He said it is one of the best books he has read in awhile. He said it was so smooth and enjoyable.
1,Interesting Title,"The title of this book is very interesting to me! I'll explain. Besides the implication that democrats have no decency, ""Deficit of Decency"" could, mutatis mucockus, be considered to justify the national debt (deficit) as decent, i.e., Bush: ""Deficits don't matter."" Going out on a limb, the def- prefix reminds me of the word ""defecate,"" which is what I wanted to do while flipping through this book. Then there's the hopelessly vague word, decency, which means different things to different people. To Miller, a balls-out kinda guy, it means something quite different than what, say, an Iraqi, or anyone who maintains contact with reality might think was decent.In other words, don't waste your time--just read the jacket cover and you'll be filled with enough righteous indignation to start your OWN war against humanity. Use the rest for fuel after the nuclear holocaust. The time you save can be spent doing research into Bush's war crimes."
1,Zell Miller,"If this kind of a party propaganda is to be read by anyone, you have to pay them, rather than ask them to buy the book."
3,Excerpt read by author on This American Life,Listen to this excerpt on the web to be moved and surprised.www.thislife.orgEpisode 308 Star-Crossed Loveaired on 2/10/06
5,Buy this one,"I liked this book as a beginner to Jini Technology. a very basic starting point with about 100 pages of author descriptions and examples, then several hundred pages of profile listings. The profile listings are very complete and cover everything you need to get going in Jini and J2ME. The examples throughout the book were clear and specific to the points the author is trying to make in each chapter. The personal profile listing in the back of the book is especially handy to have and the book never moves far from my computer - the reference aspect is great. I only wanted a basic introductory book, so I wasn't looking for a 700-page War and Peace type of thing. If you're looking for a huge tome on Jini, you may be better off with another book. But if you're looking for a good (short) basic starting point that's not going to take you a month to get through, this is a really good book."
1,Very disappointing,"This Book is very disappointing. It has over 300 pages, but only about 100 are book chapters. The remaining pages (over 200) are just appendixes describing packages!!!There are better introductions to these topics in the web, and they are for free..."
4,Maxel paper sleeves for CDs,This product was satisfactory but we now buy in bulk for 1000 at one time for the better pricing available. Some of the sleeves bought in bulk are just too thin but others work very well. Thanks to Amazon for offering a variety of sleeves. Product service was very good.
1,pretty sad,My neighbor got one of these for his birthday and on the second day it stopped working.It didn't respond to the remote and would fly on it's own. It was pretty fun while it lastd. Overall I give this toy a 2.
1,Worthless,"Even after repeated chargings, the battery only lasts long enough for a few seconds of flight. You can't use it outdoors because the slightest breeze will tip it over. You can't steer it. It's slow to respond to the control and often bashes into the ceiling while it still has enough power to get itself off the ground. Complete waste of money."
2,"stinky, dinky, hovercoptor.","my brother got this toy for Christmas and it lasted for two stinken days.what really stinks about this toy is you can only fly it on pleasent days with no wind(, snow, rain......). the styrofoem is conected with a little bit of other styrofoem butmostly TAPE! here are my results..flying in the air:2-5 it only goes up and down and sometimes it catches a drift, but otherwise sit on the couch and watch your flying junk.on the ground:0-5 you'd have to be dopy to do that, it would get smashed, if a rat crawled over it.there is nothing else to say about IT, but that the charger only takes 10 min., and 10 min. to be on the charger again.my advise is to keep the recipe and buy something that is reliable.( after you break it, which should be whithin a WEEK.)"
2,Lots of SHORT TERM FUN,"My son absolutely loved this toy. He got it as a gift onChristmas eve. However, by Christmas day, it was done for. To say this toy is not very durable would be an understatement. Certainly not worth the money spent."
4,you need this,"I'm an insatiable reader who would only buy book notes such as these for the fun of correcting them with a red marker; however this book by Faulkner is an exercise in trendy techniqe. So if you're not totally jiggy with the stream-of-consciousness method that Joyce (the master) and Woolfe were so enamored with, this will be the clue book that might help you figure out just what it is Bill was trying to say. Good Luck."
2,Sleeping with Cats: A Memoir,"I began reading this book with a delicious sense of anticipation. Ms. Piercy's writing is, as usual, beautifully crafted, almost lyrical. Her use of the cats in her life was, for me, a tantalizing hook. But unfortunately, no matter how much I wanted to care enough about her life to pick up the book after once putting it down, there was nothing in it, for me, to make that happen. I found the book to be nothing more than a not very interesting, self-indulgent trip down memory lane."
5,EXCELLENT! THE BEST ROMANCE NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ,"I missed a day of work so I could read this book! Romance at its best. THIS SHOULD BE A MOVIE! Oh to have someone as wonderful and patient as Ruark. No romance novel will ever compare to this one. If any movie producers are out there, please make a movie out of this, it is what the public would love to see!"
4,Loved this book,"Some others have felt Shanna was far too spoiled and selfish in this book. The book would not have been as entertaining without her attitude. Ruark, her husband was great. There were many twist to this story. That's something many of the authors books had. The price also was great. If you haven't read this, do it already!"
5,This what I called a TRUE LOVE from the Hero,"Long Love Story with Sparkling beginning - a bit slow/dragging in the middle - Remarkable in Pirate's Isle - and extremely wonderful end.An epic story about determination of love from the Hero toward the self-centered Heroine. But this is love at the first appearance, what can you say?What is the most unforgetable about this book? Its the Hero, Ruark Beauchamp...He is adorable ""Hero in Pursuit.I trully admired this story. Great one. Worth to try."
5,If you think this book is boring your daft,"If you think this book is boring your daft in my opinion... All you must want is the ""sexual parts"". This book is a wonderful story about how much love grows over time and how sometimes love at first sight may not be absolutely true. Shanna is a lovely woman who refuses to be stuck in an arranged marriage, so she finds a way out of it and unknowingly finds her true love! I love this book!"
3,Damn Shanna!,"Shanna will drive you crazy....but if you reallllly think about it she may be somewhat right... Part of why I love Woodiwiss' work is because she has these great periods of tense, unacknowledged desire between her hero and heroine which make it all the sweeter when they finally do get together. It would be nice if I could find a book where she would switch up the formula and have us guessing which guy the heroine was going to fall for. Anyway, the hero in this book, Ruark, is hot, hot, hot! I wish I could find a guy like this--maybe not on death row though! So that is why Shanna is oh so weary of Ruark, but in the middle of the book you really want to kick her in the rump... Between the middle and the end of this book, when you are thinking about not finishing it, it finally picks up and the adventure kicks in full gear with new territory and scurvy pirates."
2,For Completists Only,"By all means buy the Imaginary Day music disc, but skip this turkey. I am a major PM(G) fan but this DVD bites. Editing looks to be done by a curious junior high kid, but was done by Steve Rodby, the normally talented beyond belief bassist/producer of PMG. Here's hoping if Pat does another DVD he will have it professionally shot and edited. Turn up the disc but turn off the picture. Boo. Hiss."
4,great live pmg in cali,"i thought for the most part, that the quality was pretty good. my only complaint (and this would be for the other pmg dvds as well) is that the full gig is not included, nor is it in sequential order. i think that this for sure could have been achieved, since the pmg was in saratoga for at least 3 shows (i was at one of them) live versions of 'are you going with me,' 'song for bilbao,' and 'have you heard' i think, should have been included. still, i'm not disappointed overall. i totally dig the version of 'the roots of coincidence'."
1,this is not wool this is acrylic,"They sending you acrylic 100% instead of wool , this is chip hat you can buy for .99 cents anywhere"
1,Poor quality,I purchased this for my husband to wear around the outside of our home. It is made of very thin and coarse material. We are very disappointed with it's poor quality and have donated it.
3,Keeps most of your head warm.,"This keeps your ears warm very well where it is overlapped. The top of the head however is not overlapped and lets breeze in, Therefore I cannot recommend this hat at this time. If this was thicker it would be a decent hat. (but it isn't)"
5,love it!,my 6 year old daughter loves it! she really enjoys ballet and likes to watch angelina and the story is a classic!
5,Good job!,Exactly what we needed to replace a lost copy from the library. Now if only we could find the library copy so we can watch it again...
3,And me ?,I ordered this cd a few month ago and i havent still received it yet! And now i see its unavailable !! Nobody informed me ! Where can i buy this cd please ?Thanx in advance for ur helpStef
2,Disappointed...,I was disappointed with this CD. It sounded like Barbra was screeching all the time - even my 5 year old son noticed it!Next time I think I'll listen to some of the audio before purchase.
1,Insincere effort by an overrated singer,"This album is tedious, unnecessary, and insincere. It is very clear that Barbra has run out of fresh ideas, and now has to record a ""Christmas album"". What's next- Barbra singing rap songs?"
1,No-Video Board,"I opened the box, took a look and got an RMA to send it back. While not clear from the product description, this version does not have the capacity to accept a video card, so you are limited to the on board graphics. Not what I wanted."
4,"OK speakers, poor adapter bracket","The speakers sound fine, the little button on the center tweeter didn't make any difference to my untrained ears. My factory speakers were blown so anything would have sounded better. I was mounting these speakers in a '99 LHS front door, so your experience may vary. Infinity thoughtfully supplies an adapter bracket which has 2 holes and 1 slot lining up to the factory speaker holes. There are 2 problems with this bracket: 1) It is too thick, I could no longer put the speaker grille back on the door; and 2) The smaller holes for the speaker mounting were too big for the supplied bolts! A better design would sandwich the speaker between the bracket and the door, then you wouldn't even need the smaller attaching bolts. I ended up throwing the bracket away and drilling directly into the plastic door panel to attach the speakers."
3,Faux Shearling,It is a really cute vest. I wore it once. The one big thing I don't like about it is that is sheds really badly.
5,Learn from one of the best !!!,"I find all of John Riley's books to be great !!! Not only is he a terrific player, he's a very good educator.This book covers holding a groove, in depth studies of 3/4 & 5/4 odd time comping and soloing, style and analysis (comping and soloing) of drummers such as Elvin Jones, Billy Higgins, Tony Williams, and Philly Joe Jones, chapters on moeller technique and hand technique.The odd times chapters are very thorough. The style and analysis is very interesting with commentary aboutsome of the playing. So it's not just reading licks but understanding and analyzing what's going on, whatresult it produced, and perhaps why it was done. Helps a drummer to incorporate it into his playing easierwhen the concept is understood, instead of just trying to ""stick a lick"" into our playing."
5,Simply Great,This is one of Drumming's great books. Irrespective of whether you play Jazz or not you'll learn more from this book than most drummers ever know.
2,T305 review,"I installed this in a Nissan Titan. Each of the 3 people I tested it with complained about the sound quality - even though it was mounted on the visor only a foot from my head. So, the outgoing sound was poor at best. They each said it sounded as if it were over modulated. The incoming sound was barely acceptable. I had to return this and continue using a headset. It seems to work in other applications, but not mine."
4,"Old ""Bluetooth"" would be proud","As its namesake purports to be, this ""Bluetooth"" lives up to its' definition: ""helping different languages communicate"". It was very easy to install and operate. One star minus for a hard to press the on-off button."
4,Great Value,"Excellent value for the price. The only time I use a hands free device is in the care and this unit is well worth the price and is far more convenient than hanging a head set off of one's ear.Pro's: Sound quality is great and connectivity is equally as good. It maintains it's charge as advertised and if you have a Motorola Cell, it's charger works on this as well. The blue indicator light that others call annoying is as easily ignored as any other indicator light in the vehicle.Con's: Feedback from some that I have called said it sounded a little like I was talking in a tunnel, but only slightly. The power button is a little difficult to press and is not easily felt."
5,Does what I hoped it would,"My wife was alwsys 'helping me understand' that it is dangerous to drive while holding a cell phone in one hand and talking with the other hand. When my pride got out of the way, I realized that she was right. When I started looking for solutions, I found that the Motorola T305 Bluetooth Speaker was priced very reasonably such that I could at least give it a try. Now that I have it, I have found it to be very effective in terms of both hearing and being heard by the party at the other end of the line. And now I don't need as much help driving as I used to:)"
1,Poor quality,"Everytime I try to use this, I have to scream into it so that the other caller will hear me. I can never have the radio on (even on low volume) nor can I have any window even slightly open."
3,good but not perfect,"Does what it's supposed to do for a reasonable cost. Bought this to comply with the hands free law in California. The sound quality is typical of a speakerphone. Sometimes garbled, sometimes spotty. The voice recognition dialing takes some practice and patience. It does free your hands, and is much safer than fumbling with a cell phone. All in all, I am satisfied, and would recommend it as a fairly inexpensive solution to using a cell phone in the car."
2,Careful - What phone will you use?,"I had a Razr V3 which the T305 works great with. However, when I upgraded phones to the V3xx the T305 had horrible, static filled audio. I have been on the phone numerous times with my provider (Cingular) and with Motorola. Neither can offer me a solution and since this has drug on past the ""30"" day exchange period I am stuck with incompatible products.In short, I wasted $85 bucks"
1,I would have returned it but...,I would have sent it back but I waited too long.The speaker function is ok but the microphone not so much. The microphone does not work well enough in real world for the voice dial to work.At night the incessant blinking blue light in your field of vision is maddening.
1,T305 Bluetooth Speaker - Poor sound quality,The recipiant can hardly hear you and the static noise is very bad.I would not recommend this product to others.
2,Not suitable for use in moving vehicle,"I was not really impressed with this product. It seemed too sensitive to background noise and voice quality was not that great. Also, when you are out of range of cell service the unit beeps continually which was very annoying driving down the road. This was intended to replace a hard wired hands free system in my vehicle but just didn't cut it. I suppose in a very quiet environment it would be acceptable. I was probably expecting too much for what it cost."
2,You asked for it,Low price low quality. I placed this in my wifes car and everytime I call her she still has to use her phone even though you top the car and the unit suyncs wit hthe phone. ANother total waste of my money.
2,"good size, fast pairing but low volume","I bought this device 2 days ago and the first 2 hours it performed nicely. Cell phone to cell phone calls were fine, synchronization was excellent with my Motorola black razor and it even allowed me to use the voice names I had recorded in the cellphone to make calls with voice recognition, just by pressing the big blue button in the speaker phone.The problems began later, when suddenly the volume started getting very low in some calls. Since this device is for car use, the speaker should be bigger. This defeats the whole purpose of a ""speaker phone"" because yes, sometimes the audio is loud, but I've had phone calls with my wife from her office and I have to pick up the device and put it in my ear in order to listen.I will return my device tomorrow."
1,NOT FOR DRIVING!!!!!,This product was useless when trying to use it as a hands free devise for driving. It transmits what comes through the speaker into the mic therefore giving the person your speaking to an echo. Works great for the user but will drive everyone you talk to crazy. Spoke with Motorola customer service and they could not remedy the problem. Returned the product for a refund.
3,Easy to use but not perfect while driving,"Have tested the microphone/speaker quality of this product while my car (VW Beetle) is off, while idling, while on residential streets and on the freeway. Clarity is fair while car is off or stationary but while driving the people on the other end of conversation indicate there is a constant 'crackling' sound. My car is NOT soundproof but road noise is not terribly loud either. The AT&T store wanted approx $90.00 for this exact item. Thankfully Amazon is selling for less as it's not worth more than $40.00 unless you have a SUPER-SILENT luxury vehicle."
4,"good in the car, at home, even in the pocket","this little bluetooth speakerphone is a good choice to amplify the conversation at home, even in the party, and carry it in the pocketthe plus is USB charging, that I can use any USB power supply to chargethe only minus is, I can't put it too close, or the sound is cut offother than that, I am mostly happy with it"
2,OK Product - a few annoying design flaws,"This product is reasonably priced and OK. A few design flaws really make it less than functional:First, the power button is impossible to find and use, you need to use your fingernail or a pen to push it in and can't find it when you are driving - which is needed because . . . if you lose signal, which happens very frequently where I live, the unit beeps every 2 seconds with a load and annoying beep and has to be turned off. You just wish the designers would actually try using these products and they might realize the deficiencies."
3,Works well,"Good stand alone unit as an alternative to an earpiece, doesn't take long to master. Can be used outside vehicle, works better than any phone speaker if more than one person would like to speak to the caller concurrently. Some people moan about the flashing blue light for night driving, that's one reason electricians tape was invented...Prefer the T505 because it can integrate with audio system. So if tunes cranked you won't miss call, with the T305 call could be missed, but if you don't listen to deafening music, it does a great job.Always, always remember the unit has a 30 ft range and does not turn on and off with one's vehicle. So if you are 20 ft away from the unit and it is not shut off, you will have difficulty communicating with your caller."
3,Reliable connection but not great in sound,"This unit has a very reliable bluetooth connection. In terms of sound quality, both mic and speakers, is only OK. I can usually have clear conversation but once a while I have to turn the volume all the way up to barely hear a soft talker with a lot of buzz (when the volume is all the way up). The blue light is the only indication on functions. Under bright sunlight it's hard to tell if it's connected (such as after you step out the car for a short time); at night it's really bright. The mini-usb charging is great, though. I can charge through computers and other chargers with a mini-usb outlet."
3,It's just ok.,"The speaker is easy to hear out of but sometimes I have to switch to my phone because my callers can't hear me. Also it doesn't come with a AC adapter, only a power cord for the car. I find myself almost yelling at times so my callers can hear me."
4,Simple-Cheap-Works Good,"For the money, this little hands free device works really well. Long battery life and comes with auto charger, what more can you ask for."
4,Good Speakerphone,I bought this speakerphone as a gift for Christmas for my mother. It was easily installed and is basically a one button operation which was perfect for her. She loves the ability to have hands-free phone calls while driving and I feel she is much safer now. It has voice dial capability but her current phone doesn't allow so we will wait until she can upgrade her phone to utilize that feature. The only problem she had was remembering the Motorola unit would answer her phone if she hadn't powered it off and was close to the car. This was overcome by remembering to turn off when she left the car.
4,Value for the price,"This unit is really excellent. There are a few negatives that you have to accommodate to such as the small on/off switch and the mildly annoying blinking light. But, on balance it is worth it. Decent sound, great range(yes, remember to turn it off when leaving your car or it will remain on when you are within its range). But at $130 per violation for talking on a mobile phone while driving, this is a great value. Finally, the absence of a wall charger is a minor annoyance, especially if you have a RAZR or other phone that uses a USB type charger which work with the T305. This beats having a cork stuck in your ear"
4,Recommended,"Works fine. The sound could be better, but is good enough for use while driving. You don't have to shout to make yourself heard. Battery life is good and lasts for more than a week between charges. The only annoying thing is that every time you get into the car, you have to press and hold the start button for 5 seconds to turn it on. Not sure why it couldn't have been made easier to turn on."
4,Not Bad,"Good product if you don't want an earpiece hanging on the side of your head all day long. The blue flashing light to advise you that the speaker is on is only annoying in the evening and early morning hours of darkness otherwise you can't see it blinking. The speaker could use a volume upgrade, especially with todays technology. One problem I found with my unit is that my visor is angled away from my voice and more towards the roof of the vehicle so I feel that I have to either talk louder or pull the visor down a bit which sometimes bugs. A few times I just put the visor to the side and had the speaker parallel to my left ear which seems to work well. Not a bad product but Im sure Motorola will have something better soon."
1,Not usable.,"The audio quality of this device is very poor. The battery life is far less than claimed. I won't be returning the device to Amazon, but I will be looking for a similar device from another company."
1,Very unsatisfied,"This product has not worked for me as no one can hear me well at all. Everyone who I speak with on it, without exception, has said it I sound faint and garbled like I am under water. It is fully charged and clipped to my visor, I have even held the device in my hand. I drive a 96 Ford Ranger pickup for your reference as to how far the visor might be from me. I have since purchased a Jabra speaker and it works wonderfully, and I have not had one complaint. I don't recommend this unit at all."
1,Worthless in a car - modestly better in a quite room,"Briefly and to the point - do not buy this item. I am returning it. Much worse than 3 different blue tooth ear pieces I own. Bought for my girlfriend who finds earpieces uncomfortable. After 3 days of using this on her 2 hour round trip commute and getting constant complaints about the quality of the conversations she is back using a $29 earpiece device. We tried many different positions for the device in her car (new, quite Acura) with both of us being the talker and driver and the only even remotely acceptable voice quality was when we held it about 4-6 inches directly in front of our mouth. Incoming audio quality was very good but outgoing quality was extremely distorted."
2,"OK, if you can get it to recognize the word YES","We bought two of these based on reviews. Wife didn't like hers at all. Mine on voice dialing recognized every word but the Yes command that actually would initiate the call. So, no voice dialing. People on the other end reported they could not understand me. We returned them."
3,Mixed,"i don't know that i can give a fair review. the reception that people are getting on the other end of my calls say that the sound is ""broken/clipped"" but i don't know whether that has anything to do with this product. it may have to do with my cellphone carrier or my phone (which is almost 2 years old). i will have to check these things out further. the sound i'm getting on my end is great (far better than what i was hearing with an ear-piece)."
1,Missing part makes it almost useless,"The add said it was like new, but when it got here there was no manual, and the sun visor clip was missing. That is what makes the whole thing usable. My email to the shipper was ignored, so I am not able to use it. I have since bought one from ATT that works great. I am not at all happy with the seller , Gottdeals, and I would not recommend anybody to deal with them."
4,God and His Attributes,"The book explains the monotheistic view of Islam in twenty one short lessons. The author attempts to refute the materialistic point of veiw while presenting reasoning for a monotheistic world order. In doing so, the author deals with belief in the unseen, finiteness of the chain of causality, God's justice, free wiil and volition. This is a great book for those who want to learn about Islamic philosophy and world-view."
2,small can,Please note this is only a 3.5 oz. can. It is not a particularly inexpensive product at $7.15 a can.
4,I knew her when....,I knew Cindy at Venture school. anyone who doubts this is true (as one prior reviewer) needs to wake up. They use her maiden name as that was her name at the time. The book reads well and seems accurate in its account. I knew Shirley and Cindy both. It's sad to read from other reviewers that Cindy's not made it on the outside. I'd hoped better for both of them.
2,"Not ""Retouching Handbook"", but ""retouching for beginner""","The auther should rename the book title as ""Retouching for beginner"" to prevent confused to the readers. It is just a book for beginning level, not a retouching handbook.I did not find any advanced skill in this book."
5,Very helpful for new Six-Sigma practitioners,A must-have for all new six-sigma practitioners! A very clear/concise guide to available project tools and applications of those tools. Clearly written and easy to understand; VERY helpful for beginners!
3,"It is about MINITAB and Six Sigma, but...","Ok, I liked it.However, do not expect that by reading this book you will get a complete understanding of what Six Sigma is (or the opposite).The book combines several examples using MINITAB 14, which an excellent statistical tool.If you like Six Sigma, this is a nice-to-have book, but you will need more than this book to get satisfied.It is a good resource, but not the best.Some ""physical"" aspects: The size is nice when you have to travel."
3,Very brief overview.,This was a very brief overview of two areas. LaPaz and Bahia Magdelena(sp). The later being the bay to watch whales in December. It barely scratched the surface of the area. I was extremely disappointed in this video.
4,MAXELL CD/DVD Colored Sleeves,"Sleeves are of good quality, and window is well attached. The colors are pleasing, and consistant.I've ordered probably 20 packs or more from AMAZON, since Office Depot moved out of town.Great product, you'll be happy with them."
2,Too Thin,We go though a lot of CD sleves. I found this product very poor. The sleeves are almost as thin as rice paper. The CDs didn't slip in very easy. On some envelopes the sleeve flaps were half white. The boxes were falling apart.
4,ok,a little flimsy compared to the same product in white. but serves its purpose. fits CD and DVD's perfectly. will buy again provided the white ones aren't on sale or cheaper.
1,Does Not Explain How to Write An IPS,"First of all Amazon should have a policy against relatives of the author writing reviews as you can see by the first two reviews. I am quite sure the Mr. Gardner is very good at his investment job but the couple of hours of effort that seemingly went into this ""book"" with the the accompanying price leave me feeling ripped off. Fortunately, I did not pay full price because this is not really a book but better described as a 50 page pamphlet that should be distributed for free. The first 8 chapters are all 2-4 pages long and are not particularly informative. The two ten-page templates that then follow are more informative and useful but still could use a greatly expanded explanation. There are several books out there at twice the price but with ten times the information that would serve a burgeoning financial advisor better."
5,Works great on a 9 gal Craftsman,"Like others have said, this does NOT mount with the ""standard"" threaded nut and plate that the original filter used on my shop-vac. However, it slides nicely over the base and is held securely in a ""push on"" design.My vac is back to full suction now, great!"
2,Does not fit all Ridgid Shop Vacs,I have a Ridgid 9 gallon shop vac and the filter was about an inch too long. I actually had to cut an inch off the bottom and drill a center hole in the bottom plate to re-mount it. I don't know the model off hand but it was purchased in 2008.
3,Just a little better than average.,"Bought these for my wife. The cups are okay. I am not impressed with the way the handles are attached, three small spot welds. Some of the spot welds don't even connect metal to metal, it is metal to air. There are no bends in the cups to make pouring liquids easier. One odd feature, is that the smaller the cup size, the longer the handle. Handles are longer than most measuring cups. Easy to see the cup size on the handle. Will have to see how well chineese stainless holds up. A little pricy for a chineese poduct. Would not by again, would gamble with something else."
1,Design flaw,"I have to be harsh here, because measuring cups really are very simple items, and not much should go wrong with them. I have not had any issues with handles breaking off (I have the older version of the set, and they seem to be sturdy).However, I have a general problem with handles that are welded or glued: such items are more difficult to clean than those with handles that are contiguous with whatever is attached to them. That is the reason why professional tools are designed to minimize food residues getting trapped in creases or where parts are attached to each other (ladles, spatulas, etc.).In addition, the bottom of these measuring cups are 90 degrees to the walls, which again easily traps the ingredient to be measured, particularly flour.Agreed, all that is much less of a nuisance in a home kitchen, but to me, it's still a nuisance."
5,Great set of measuring cups,"I have purchased a lot of things on Amazon, some large and some small but this set of measuring cups is by far the best product I have purchased to date. It is heavy duty and durable. What I love about this set is that you have a 2/3 measurement. For those of you who take your cooking seriously (like I do) you should get this set. In addition, it is not expensive. Love it. Love it."
5,Wonderful,I received these for Christmas and have already used them countless times. I LOVE THEM!!!! They are the best measuring cups I have ever own and will be the last. They are super durable and sturdy!
2,not from france,"amazon product description said these measurement cups are from ""renowned French company"" but miu france products are now made cheaply in china by xinhua corporation.Pros: the long handles are nice. stainless steel thickness seems durable.Cons: scuff marks and metal burs on the inside. some of the handles had sharp edges like it could cut my fingers. they look and feel unfinished. and no additional measurement indicators on the inside.I thought these were going to be good but the finish quality was very poor. disappointed and returning them."
3,Measuring cups,I only bought these measuring cups because I thought they were made in France. Wrong. Made in China. They are pretty good quality but I should have read all the fine print.
5,Recommend these measuring cups,Heavy & sturdy. I was having a difficult time finding a 3/4 & 2/3 cup size. This set has it.
5,the real steel deal,"For any cook who needs multiple measuring tools, this set is excellent - all the way down to the two tablespoon measure. The weight is substantial, and the material is strong. I recommend this set."
3,"Ok, but","I bought these cups because they had all the sized I needed for cooking anything. However, though they say they are dishwasher safe, all of the handles are beginning to come off! I bought 2 sets and 4 handles have fallen off so far - the first shortly after purchasing."
3,Good coffee if you have the time,"Just tried it out for the first time at about 8900 feet. Very good coffee but took almost 45 minutes for a pot to brew. That is just way too long for fishermen who want a quick cup before trolling for the big one. Also, the coffee, even right after the brew cycle , is less than hot. Let it sit there for a few minutes and it is less than luke warm. Now you have to go through the added hassle of transferring to another pot and re-heating. Jury is still out on this product."
2,Nothing Fantastic,"This book came highly recommended to me, and I have to admit, nothing about it was significant or spectacular.My two immediate conclusions for why this book recieves such rave reviews are fan nostalgia, and that the creators who immediately proceeded Byrne really botched things up.I tend to dislike a book more than I otherwise would when a book fails to live up to high expectations. Unfortunately, this is the case here.Not to say that this is a bad read. It isn't. Byrne is at the top of his game here, and it shows on every page. But modern comics have inevitably eclipsed this material (compare the Fantastic Four vs. Ego to the modernized version of The Authority vs. ""God""). Sometimes it's not the novelty of a story that makes it great, but the way it's told.I'll say this: buy this book if, and only if, you are a Fantastic Four completist. Otherwise, you're gonna be walking in on someone else's show."
5,Pristine musicality!,"Despite of the fact I have always wondered around the prestigious performance of Efrem Kurtz as suggestive depicter of atmospheres and dreamy sonorities, the time has not placed him in a better place at the moment to make any account of genuine brilliantness and sheer musical architect. Kurtz was undeniably, a genuine colorist, one of these directors of the lineage of Anatole Fistulari or Isaac Dobrowen for instance, a fine conductor whose radiant imagination fitted as ring to finger in this peerless and gild version. The Philharmonia Orchestra as always featuring a remarkable performance.This record constitutes by itself a magnificent opportunity to approach him. Don't miss this celebrated performance."
5,One Great Book!,It's factual and up to date! Vera Appleyard is very knowlegable about lovebirds and pet birds. This is a great book for first time owners and veteran Lovebird owners alike.
1,wrong size,If you order this you will get a 2 inch ball not the 1-7/8. 21543 is the part number for a two inch ball starter kit.
5,A masterpiece!,"This album came out when I was in my last year of high school. Being a drummer, I was listening to everything back then. This album was a masterpiece then, and it's a masterpiece now."
4,Worth Waiting For...,"Well, it took me literaly years to get a copy of this fabulous album, but I finally found one at a reasonable price. Worth listening to for Bloomfield's guitar solos, there was some material I don't care for.Not bad, not bad at all."
5,best dance single of the year 99,"the rhythm of the song take me in to the dance mood each time, even in early morning, and if i'm in the car i start to increase the speed about 2 tms."
5,awesome,"The DVDs (I bought Guilty 1 and 2) came right on time in perfect packaging and everything. The series is great.The only thing that annoyed me is that I paid 30 bucks for one and two and then I realized you could pre-order the whole season for the same price... but it was perfect, worth buying"
4,The Anti-Rock Star Matures,"I was first introduced to Devendra on a terrific show found on the NPR website called ""All Songs Considered,"" and I rushed out and bought ""Rejoicing."" Recently, a neopsychedelic show called the Kaleidoscope Cafe on the website Radio Free Phoenix featured the track ""Heard Somebody Say,"" and it gave me the chills. It is the best of the handful of Iraq War songs and deserves to be alongside the great protest songs of John Lennon. I purchased the album based on that song alone and I was not disappointed. It doesn't have the gritty street performer sound of his previous releases, which is a good thing. You will hear tremendous growth and a great sense of things to come from this amazing artist."
5,Maybe the best Histology book,"Just for using human tissues this book is wonderful. Enough for monkey, pig, rat or horse tissues. Besides, the proposal of discarding the old classification of tissues and instead use now an cellular approach is very appropriate. And above all clear and precise descriptions. This book would be better with more mollecular details, and more information in morphology; but it ouststands many other books in the field."
5,Don't Even THINK of having a face lift without reading this!,"Lucky me. I just happened to see a review of this book in a local magazine and since I had already scheduled my face lift, I hurried home and bought it on-line. I'm soooooo glad I did. The book was very enlightening. It was an easy read (I read the whole book, taking notes, in about an hour). I liked the fact that she was brave enough to include her own photos of the entire process. The very best part is that she offers a ""Survival Kit"" that contains EVERYTHING needed to recoup from the surgery. I just received my kit today and I am thrilled! If you are thinking about cosmetic surgery, this is a MUST read!"
4,Never fails to amaze me...,"The thing about the original series, despite all of its drawbacks, is that it never fails to pose really tough questions. Does the good of the many out weigh the good of the one? This question, also posed in TWOK, is presented in The Galilieo Seven. This episode also shows the true ""dangers"" of space exploration, and conflicting orders. Spock's admission of being stubborn is priceless. In the second Episode, Court Martial, we see Kirk on trial and his crew rally together to support him. Bottom line, on both episodes, there are important and defining moments which allow the user to really feel a part of the Enterprise"
1,"If you like FUN, skip this one","I decided that I had to SUFFER through the ENTIRE book before making an intelligent decision about the book itself. This book was DREADFUL and I embraced each moment as a ray of sunshine when I could put it down. Dori Carter uses too many CAPITALIZED words for my taste, in addition to words in italics that I just didn't understand. I thought this book was going to be fun, based on the title and the happy couple on the cover of the paperback edition. This is an EXAMPLE of a book that defines the cliché, you can't judge a book by its cover."
2,Just OK...,"While the biotechnology industry, industrial espionage and the human organ transplant field are perfect fodder for a thriller, I didn't feel this book lived up to it's possibilities.First off, the heroine gets hired as THE corporate lawyer by a huge biotech firm. She lies on her resume about her background and experience. And NO ONE bothers to check her background and references? Yeah right.If you can get past that, the book then becomes a pretty good(if somewhat by-the-formula)read.Until I got to the end and found the ending totally unsatisfying. Without giving it away, I still had alot of questions as to what happened to whom at the end. Ms. Christofferson did not tie up her lose ends. Hate that!"
1,Disappointed,"This is the first time that I purchased through Amazon, and although the item was delivered in good time - things went bad from there. The incorrect item was sent (could have been my error?) and the e-mail address on the paperwork was undeliverable. I was able to make contact by phone and they were helpful. I had to pay to ship back the original item. The second order came - but with NO paperwork what-so-ever. It doesn't fit. The claim is that 'one size fits most'. I have a small size head and it's tight on me - I specified that I needed a large. Without paperwork I am now the owner of a beret that doesn't fit...... To sum things up: I'm very disappointed as it was intended as a gift. A costly experience with this particular company for sure!"
2,Larger than what I thought,This would be fine for a costume or a specific purpose. The size would actually fit an adult. It was not what I expected.
2,Wool Beret,We waited weeks for this beret to come in the mail. It is sewn nicely and looks very nice. BUT it smells very strange so my son cannot wear it yet. We are in the process of airing it out...but he likes it.
2,Well made but poorly engineered,"I bought these because I rest my elbows on my table when I use my computer. Over time, this has caused calluses to form on my elbows and occasionally infections, plus general low-level discomfort. The problem with these pads is that the 'one size fits all' straps are too tight. I would have expected these to be adjustable, but in the photo of this item you cannot see the straps. As it is, the pads could serve simultaneously as tourniquets. And in spite the tight bands the pads tend to shift anyway. (I think this is because the pads are hard and non-conforming to the elbow). I gave a 2 star review because these pads are well sewn and appear to be made of high quality materials plus the supplier shipped very quickly. Now if only I could find some use for these pads....PS: I think the better way to go would be to get some foam pads and instead of affixing them to my elbow, simply put them on the table and rest my elbows on them."
4,Rand McNally 2005 Large Scale Atlas,This is a very easy to read and use while traveling. I couldn't do without it.
4,A VERY NICE BOOK,"THIS WAS MY 1st """"LANCASTER COUNTY"""" BOOK. NEEDLESS TOSAY THERE IS A LOT OF RELIGION HERE. IT WAS ENJOYABLETO READ A BOOK WITHOUT MURDER, KILLING, DRUGS ANDASSORTED MAYHEM. AT TIMES I DID GET LOST BECAUSEI DID NOT READ THE PRECEDING FIVE BOOKS---A LOT-LOT-LOT OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERS. IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT,THE RELIGION, THIS WOULD BE A GOOD SERIES TO READ."
2,blah blah blah,ok this book started off good.....but....became so boring!! switching back and forth between people left me feel so confused and i love bl books??? what went wrong???
3,The continuation of three series/books stuffed in one cover!,"I would definitely rethink my rating if Beverly Lewis had made each part another whole book, especially about Katie and Dan. They certainly deserve another sequel to continue the Shunning series. As for Philip and Rachel from Postcard/Crossing fame, another book surely is coming. The last part of this book brings back Sarah Cain. While her story is mostly about her new family of children, the author does manage a nice little twist by showing us the heart of Sarah now and combining characters from more than one past series/book. I think there is more in the offing. At least I can hope."
4,The Two Tristans,"I'd like to compare briefly the two famous Tristan sets - this by Beecham and another by Reiner on Naxos label.Flagstad are excellent and similar on both sets, Melchior to my mind is better with Reiner.Reiner and Beecham made very different interpretations, Beecham is more fiery and dynamic, Reiner is more lyrical and transparent and both are total involving in this wonderful score and producing excellent music flow.Sound quality is far superior on Naxos due to excellent restoration work."
4,At just the right moment,"The real worth of this release is not the documentation of crowd chants, but capturing some of Dylan's best songs, in excellent performances, at the most important point in his career, after the sometimes-awkward folk protests, but before he entered his flaccid rock phase of the 1970s and beyond. The acoustic disc probably wins as the best of the two, but the electric disc ruts and cuts. Its viciousness, tempered with a rueful melodicism, more than makes up for the bandwagon-jumping jerks in the audience."
1,couldn't make myself read the whole thing,this book was horible!! I didn't get half way through the book before i lost ALL respect for the characters!! I am a fan of Peretti and I love some of his other books but i must say DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!
5,An incredible story of devine good vs. total evil.,Frank E. Peretti did such a wonderful job of writing this book. I carried it everywhere and read it at every opportunity. I was very sad when it was over. The battle between good and evil was incredible. Being a new Christian it really helped me understand the devil and how he can take over our lives if we loose our faith. It was like Steven King but with a lesson.
4,Awesome,"Let me start out by saying if you are a fan of Steven King you will love this book. I have never read any of Frank Peretti's books before, but after reading this one I want to go out and buy every book he's written! My review really doesn't do any justice to this book it was that great! I love the way he uses words anyone can understand, and the way he writes really grabs you, and makes you believe you are right there in the story along with the characters. My dad bought This Present Darkness, and Piercing The Darkness, a long time ago so now i'm reading them too. Buy the book I know you will love it."
3,A scary view of what sin does to us!,"This book is at times gruesome, thrilling, and shocking - but in certain places it drags out a bit. While I loved Peretti's ""Darkness"" books, this one was less satisfying, but still contains a vivid picture of how sin ruins lives. Check it out from the library rather than buy it though."
5,"A great thriller, and non-offensive, too","The Oath was one of the best books I've read in a long time. It was as exciting as it could get, and it had its moments of disappointment, but also its moments of great triumph. Everyone should read this book. I usually read other genres, but this one would be liked by anyone. If you like Frank Peretti, and especially the fact that he doesn't put a bunch of needless trash in his books, you will also like Death of an Eagle, by Kirby Jonas. It is exciting from the very beginning, but he keeps it clean so that anyone can read it. These two authors are in different categories, but both are well worth reading."
5,A Double Take,Wow! This book makes you take a double take on life and the part that sin plays in our life. I have read it a few times now and there is such a deeper meaning to it than some may think. It is perfect for the mystery book lovers and once you start reading it grips you to the end. Definetely a book worth reading.
3,"A good read, but Peretti abandoned what made him great","The Oath kept my attention, it was entertaining, but if I did not know this was a ""Christian"" book, I certainly would never figure it out from reading Peretti's watered down semi-christian monster story. In his earlier work, this author wrote books with a strong spritual theme. In ""The Oath"" it seems almost like he was adding the luke warm quasi-Christianity out of a sense of obligation. Compare if you will the scene out of ""Piercing the Darkness"" in which a woman is saved. She repents wholeheartedly, calls upon Jesus, and all of Heaven rejoices. There is no doubt of what happened. In ""The Oath"" it is hard to tell what happened to the main character, spiritually speaking. Bottom line is that it is obvious that in order to appeal to a larger crowd, Frank Peretti has sold out by watering down any possible ""offensive"" or strong Christian doctrine."
3,"Great symbolism, book is just OK","This book was good, but not great. The initial mystery of the story and symbology that expressively grew was really good. The ending was kind of exciting, but kind of strange, and kind of overdone. I thought the characters we well done, and the writing style was very good. I enjoy Frank Peretti very much, but I think overall this book just didn't hit the mark high enough for me to give it 4 stars."
1,"Very predictable, boring, and slow","Peretti is a great writer, but this book was hard to read. There were some good parts to the book, but the action and fantasy aspects of the book were not well done."
2,Too satanic. Not very uplifting.,"After reading ""This Present Darkness, Piercing the Darkness and the Prophet"", I was very disappointed with this book. I found the three books mentioned to be so spiritually uplifting and motivating. Loved the Heavenly Hosts and received some clear messages. The Oath did nothing for me spiritually. I found it very hard to want to finish. It was near the end when the biblical phrase ""if you have the faith of a mustard seed all things are possible"" came to mind."
2,not impressed,I thought this book was good & suspensful at first but as I kept reading it just seemed silly. The book was depressing with all the murders and the christian part of it was very weak. I kept expecting it to be more like his other books with more of a good vs. evil plot. The lead character becomes a believer ... Stupid! I would not recommend this book
2,Chris,"I LOVED This Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness by Frank Peretti so I was so eager to read this book. I was very disappointed by the slowness of the story line. While, I enjoyed the ending, It was not worth the 4 times I had to check it out of the library to finish reading it. It took 350+ pages to get going. I don't recommend this book, I am sorry to report."
1,Dreadful!!!!,It seems most know this author is a christian writer. I did not know this when I read it. However this is a very boring book. I ceased caring what happened to any of the characters long before the 3 cassette. It is very contrived and lacking in originality. Some books have (perhaps unintentionally) clear conclusions from the start but you enjoy the ride to the end. This was not one of them. I think that this author would not get read if he was not known as a christian and do not intend to look for him in the future.
3,"needs work, fut functional",Very functional! A bit noisy with the cot part on the pole. Coleman says to try corn starch; they are aware of the problem - design flaw
1,this book is not worth the time it takes to read it,"The title of this book is misleading. There is no step-by-step guide to assembly language. In fact, there is not even a single example of an assembly language program in the book. Spend the money on an assembler and learn from the documentation that comes with the software."
3,Not for students!,I felt that this book did not give much reference to the language itself but more so on good programming habits. I feel that this book is not for one who wishes to study assembly language. The student should look for a book that has full explanations of all the commands and laws to each command. Also I found a couple of mistakes in the book.
3,"Not bad, but not enough","I really enjoyed this book, and the author has a great writing style that makes the content accessible to everyone. There are a few things you need to consider before buying this book. First, it was written in the late 80's, so the technology described in the book has long since become obsolete. The author considers the 486 the best processor on the market, but we've come a long way since the 486. It's not as bad as it sounds though, since many of the concepts apply to todays computers and CPU's, and may be a good groundwork to building an understanding of todays complicated computers.Also, this book probably will -not- teach you assembly language. In fact the title is a little misleading. What this book does do is teach you the inside and outs of how your CPU and memory work, which is almost mandatory if your going to program in assembly language.You will need to read other books to fully learn assembly language, but this was a great book to start with."
1,Made my explorer misfire Chose Autolite instead,"These spark plugs may be a clever implementation of an old idea, but they don't get along with my Ford Explorer. Immediately after installing these, the engine began to misfire at 1500-2000 RPM no load and at very light load (30MPH in 5th gear). Misfire city. Fine under load, so they were not cracked. Hundreds of misfires on the OBD2 counter. Searching the internet revealed I was not the only one having problems with bosch plugs in explorers. Just to be sure, I also cleaned the MAF sensor and checked for vacuum leaks. Replacing these with autolite APP103 cured the misfire. I suspect the ""no gap required"" is not a hot enough spark. Avoid these in a ford explorer. I had to give a rating - 0 stars is more appropriate. I wish I could return them."
1,Naturalizer Women's Wedge Sandal scandel,Pretty shoe but the sizes are misleading. When they say 8.5 Wide what they mean is 8.0 Narrow.
1,Terrible accuracy!,"This morning i weighed myself and it fluctuated THIRTEEN POUNDS on the same even hardwood floor surface. I have no idea what my weight is, so it totally defeats the purpose of this scale. I'm definitely returning this."
2,This thing is more fickle than a 13 y/o girl.,I didn't try to return this because honestly it wasn't really worth the time. I would buy a different product if I were you. There are plenty of them out there.
2,Great when it works - but too often does not,"When we bought this scale, I chose to believe the many favorable reviews and ignore the negatives (which seemed to be the minority). Having used this scale for about 3 months now, it's time for me to add to add to the negative reviews. When it works, it's great (note that we were not looking for the body fat/water analysis - only a good quality high capacity scale). However, we seen it eat through batteries as some of the other reviewers did (I think in 3 months we've had 4 or 5 sets - I lost track) - we actually have resorted to taking out the batteries when not using it. Also, we have had numerous problems where the scale continually cycles through ""setup"" mode when you tap it to turn it on - when this happens, you can't weigh yourself. This symptom started out happening infrequently, but now happens most of the time. Today was the last straw - I tried for about 10 minutes to get it out of this mode before I gave up - will buy a new scale today."
4,"Elegant, Acurate and Everybody Likes It!","When I bought this scale I weighed 388, and now I'm down to 354! It's the most acurate scale I've personally used! It doesn't give you several different readings, They are always on the same weight time after time, unless of coarse you move around, or lean too far forward.... My wife loves it as well, she is skinny and it works she tells me like her doctor's scale! So it's good at all ranges in 120's or the 380's so buy one and enjoy cause it's good looking... It's a tad complicated for those of us on the rotund or technoligically disadvantaged sides of things but once we got used to how it works the other measurements are cool! Also I like it because I can stand on it with out problem as some of the other scales out there state that they can weigh up to 400 lbs, however try standing on them!"
3,"Good Scale, Bad Body Fat Analysis","In general this scale is consistent with respect to both body weight and body fat; however, the scale is not measuring body fat, it's calculating it based on the input of height, maybe some effect to age and the user's weight - hence some reviewers calling for a ""body type"" setting.I must admit that ""they got me"" on this one as I assumed this scale was actually measuring body fat as it appears to have receptors for transmission of electrical current to actually ""measure"" body fat. It's simply not the case. At 6'1"", 191lbs, it measures my body fat to 25.1, which is essentially my calculated BMI give or take a few tenths. BMI of course does not give effect to a user's build, just weight to height.Overall if you're looking for a simple scale you can count on consistent readings, but it's not a true body fat analyzer. If you want true body fat analysis look for a scale that uses ""bioelectrical impedance analysis""."
3,Good scale but...,"going from profile to profile if you have more than one user is not straightforward, plus I think the degree of accuracy is a little suspect. Nice looking and easy to read dial."
4,Great value,"Very pleased with is scale. No problems with setup, easy to understand directions. Good quality, sturdy and display is easy to read. My husband is 6 feet 7 inches and it definitely lives up to it's accuracy for weighing large capacity. To measures percentage of body fat it is very sensitive. To use you must press your foot on the left side of the scale until you see your user number, but you can not touch for very long or it will pass your number and stay on the next users number. You will then have to wait for the scale to reset to try again. So, take care in pressing directly in the middle if you only want to use the weight mode. All in all, great value and would recommend."
2,Unreliable,"Unfortunately, I have been very disappointed by this product. Readings can vary up to 7 pounds in one day and I only have the product 4 months."
1,Died after 7 months of use.,This scale has quit working despite the fact that I only used it on occasion. About a month after purchase the scale did not want to switch users to keep track of profiles. I am very disappointed. Of course you can only return it after 30 days so now I feel as though it was a huge waste of money.
1,Died in 60 days,"I bought this scale after reading many of the glowing reviews, feeling that it was unlikely that I would also receive a defective product. Unfortunately, after barely 60 days of use, the scale ceased functioning entirely yesterday. It is well outside of the return period, too, so I won't be recouping any of my loss on this one. My advice is to skip this brand's poor quality and find a better, cheaper scale that won't quit so easily!"
3,Not as great as we expected,"We were really excited about the lights for our son, but he was mildly impressed. He probably would have been happier with a bigger set & no lights."
2,product discriptionis wrong,"The product discription lies!! they come in translucent colors not primary colors. i bought an extra package of primary color to match, what a joke. the lights are huge, not what i was expecting at all! i added pictures, see for yourself"
3,Dry Book,Not exciting to read but makes the point about how a church can change culture and help people.
5,Wonderful Olivia,"Olivia Newton-John is wonderful in this video. She is definatly exploring new area here. In the video ""Soul Kiss"" she is in red while rolling around on a red cloth table in a steamy and fiery room. She and her at-the-time husband, Matt Lattanzi, Recreated some very famous kiss scenes from such movies as ""Casablanca.""The concept of the ""Toughen Up"" video was very neat as she takes on dual roles, one as a school teacher at a finishing school for girls, and the other as a young school girl.The videos for the songs ""Emotional Tangle"" and ""The Right Moment"" are apsolutely beautiful with Olivia in a room full of mirrors.The video for ""Culture Shock"" is her as a lounge singer performing the song in a long gold jacket.This whole video is VERY eighties, but is an absolute must-have for any Olivia fan!"
5,Romanian echo,"Now, since my English is not too good I'll first of all say this CD is worth every cent I paid for it. It really doesn't matter there were a few technical difficulties with the mikes. I only know this album to have got together Miles Davis with Sonny Stitt. I sure love them both so when I found about it I didn't bother to listen to samples. I waited for the CD to arrive and when I first played it the first thing I thought of was that it's a shame there is only one of it's kind. You don't have to especially love Miles and/or Sonny; if you lave jazz you don't want to miss this CD."
4,6 Months Later,"I did a lot of research before selecting this one, and our family has been using it every couple of days, still working great. The kettle part takes a little work to master, the latch is not so intuitive. I think someone else mentioned it has a warmer in the base, which is correct and a great feature, in my opinion. I have been using portion packs with it, works pretty well that way."
1,poor packaging glass broken,"I have ordered this machine twice in last two months. Both times I received the unit with the glass broken. I am sure the machine would be great, but the packaging doesn't work!"
5,loving it,product was received a lot sooner then i excepted. made popcorn for the family. a great turn out. material all work very well. i am glad to received this. and what a great popcorn party. easy tray pulls out for easy cleaning. smell great too. nothing to put together already assembles.
5,Excellent Popcorn Maker!,"We have had this machine for one year and have LOVED it from the minute I put it together! It took a few times to work out a good recipe, but once we figured out the best popcorn to use and the oil to kernel ratio, this machine put out the most delicious popcorn ever - better than the movie theater. Kernels pop crisp and tasty. Never a moments trouble with this machine either. The motor is quiet, not hard to clean, and 2 batches make more popcorn than the three of us can eat. Love the separate warmer!You can't go wrong with this attractive, well built, easy to use popcorn maker!!"
5,Well worth the money!,"A 4oz bag works great for 1-3 people. I always keep some in the unit to eat the next day. Nothing better than next day popcorn.5 out of 5 stars as this one works perfect for the price. Also easy to clean,"
2,"Decent, but inconsistent. Doesn't live up to Scott or Dick.","BR2 was, overall, an enjoyable read. It succeeded in keeping me guessing what exactly was going on, but left me disappointed with it's resolution.The book draws heavily on images, characters, and dialogue from the movie, with a little help from Dick's novel. As with some of the Star Wars novels, however, this feels like a mantra used to evoke something without full justification. It also seems to be asking for someone to make a movie sequel out of it, being writen in an almost cinematic style.Blade Runner (the movie) and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep both had their amazing qualities, and the creation of BR from DADoES was an impressive feat. By trying to reunite the two, Jeter does both a disservice."
1,Looks like a script turned novel,"This novel reads like an unsold script for a Blade Runner movie turned into book form. It's just a rehash of the original...except not nearly as thought-provoking or entertaining. This was one of the tougher reads I've ever experienced. If this were the only book I had on a deserted island...I'd just eat it, because there's no way I could re-read it."
4,It's got a good beat and you can dance to it,"I enjoyed ""The Edge of Human"" - But -(there's always a big but in every review, right?) Jeter should have been a little more original, casting off the old characters and bringing new ones to life. He does okay with the main character, Deckard, however - he just should have kept him away from L.A. Afterall, he was on the run, right? Good story though -"
1,identification ?????,I perchased an chilton import repair manual. The first car I worked on was a Honda civic I took down the vid. no.Went to the manual there was no identificatin chart wasnt sher of the year and engine this book is useless I was lucky the owners manual was in the car.All the other manuals I have (american made cars) have a id chart at the first of every section. Why not on the import cars the book is useless.Could some one let chilton know about this error. Thank you Quick
3,not enough indepth photos and information on each subject,Things like drive train ie reassembley and disasembely. also engine repair. MORE PHOTOS AND MORE DESCRIPIONS
5,Must see show!,"This is probably one of my favorite shows on TV right now. There is humor, drama, and a little bit of action. I love detective shows and this incorporates that aspect with some original ideas as well. This is the best Showtime show out of all I have seen. I like how they focus on one serial killer or theme each season - Ice Truck Killer, Trinity, etc. This show just keeps getting better and better!"
5,Great product and Sender,"Recently I was looking to purchase the Dexter shows in order to catch up befor the new season comes out in Sept. However was not easy to find in my area, so I decided to look on Amazon and found exactly what I was looking for at a great price. The seller was great took my order and got it shipped right away. Great doing business with you I would definatly recomend this seller 100%. Thank you."
1,Very poor service,"I purchased seasons 1-5 of Dexter, what I received were cheap copies of the series that were pixelated.Now if i want to actually enjoy the series I'm gunna need to repurchase them. : ( Very disapointed with this seller! ! !"
3,One season missing,Love the show but very disappointed that I got two Season Two and no Season Four. I had taken all the plastic off before I realized this so I can't return it. Anyone get two Season Four and no Season Two? Maybe Amazon can help us exchange.
4,"Good fun, but then what?","It was fun to go through the first time, but now it is just sitting on a shelf. Should have just picked up at library."
3,if only it were this easy.,"josh mcdowell is an evangelical apologist (defends orthodox Christianity) and a popular speaker on college campuses. this work is an agglomeration of selections from his 2 volume set EVIDENCE THAT DEMANS A VERDICT. in short, this book will answer a lot of simple questions about perceived errors or inconsistencies in the bible. his answers have helped thousands of Christians to strengthen their faiths. with respect to scholarly issues, these are ""band-aid"" answers however. EXAMPLE: Jesus was either LORD, liar, or lunatic (mcdowell). now this is valid given what Jesus said; however the real question in the eyes of skeptics is did he really ever say what the gospels record. if you have a question for sunday school or just occasional curiosity, this is great for evangelicals - but if you have any serious academic interest, this is probably not the route to go. i personally would suggest cornelius van til."
5,Josh makes a top value defense,"As usual, Josh comes to a point and states his values and ideas in specific and readable terms. You can always benefit by his books."
3,A book only a Financial Planner could love.,"While this book is generally well written and I admitthat I gleaned a few good ideas from it (as well asreinforcing stuff I already knew about asset allocation),ultimately it was dissappointing in that it constantlykept steering the reader towards the conclusion that youneed a team of experts to build and manage a proper investmentportfolio. Seeing as all the authors work for an investmentconsulting firm themselves, I guess this is no surprise.But, if you have less than a million dollars to invest and/orthink you can manage without a ""portfolio strategist"" andothers, then perhaps this is not the best book for you."
4,"Good characters, great plot",This story has been done a thousand times. Still Benford has done a slamup job on making the old into something new. There is the usual mix of humans and their meeting other sentient beings. In this case the surprise comes as the main guy figures out just who the aliens are and why they are the way they are. Great read.
5,A masterful epic,"Benford balances the story of struggle against a peculiar invasion on Earth with that of a captivating voyage of discovery in space. While the Earth based story is engaging, the latter plot with fascinating and intricately creative descriptions of far-off worlds makes this book truly excellent."
5,Great Bat House,It is very well made of cedar and concise instructions were provided on care and placement in order to attract bats.
4,Great price,I like to keep my cars and boat looking like new so I took a chance with this product and am glad I did. The only minor gripe I have is the handle becomes loose easier than I like.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I've glad I read this, because I'm interested in Trollop--and I like him--because of his novels, but I didn't enjoy this book as much as the other reviewers did. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I wanted to know more than Trollope told about himself, and I wanted to know different things than he chose to tell."
2,Magnetic fall out,"When we first got the Magnetix extender set my children loved them. Then after a couple of months of building, the magnetics starting coming out of the extenders, rendering the set unusable. I tried to super glue them back in with no luck. In my opinion, Magnetix are a bit on the pricey but I didnt mind paying the extra especially since my kids loved them and played with them often. However, they are definitely not worth the money when they fall apart.We also have the regular Magnetix set and we havent had a problem with the magnetics coming out of them."
4,Pianoless Octet,"From the early 1960's - Pianoless octet - Slide Hampton lets Freddie Hubbard and George Coleman do much of the soloing joining them on occasion - The tune Conversation Piece is actually Gigi Gryce's better known composition - Minority. So It's 3 slide Hapmton original and 1 apiece from Duke Ellington, Randy Weston, and Gigi Gryce. The Title track has nothing to to with the Freddie Redd tune of the same name."
1,Awful!!!,"My husband and I bought this monitor for our baby thinking it would be great. We were WRONG!! We liked how it would hook on the side of the crib or pack-n-play, but the handheld part was awful. We could only put it in a certain part of our house and it had to face a certain way and maybe if someone didn't walk in front of it, it would work. Other than that, pure static. We have since found out that Fisher Price makes better monitors. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage."
1,Does not work.,Ordered product. Placed 5 antennas in back of battery area as described. Did not get any improvement in signal. Would not buy again or recommend this product.
2,Is it worth the money? That depends...,"This is VERY inexpensive: it costs a penny, and while the shipping is far too high for an item that could be slipped into a first class envelope, it's still relatively inexpensive.That's why I tried it. I figured that I wouldn't be out too much money.Does it work? I'm not sure. I haven't been able to conduct controlled experiments - only a scientist could - but I can say that it *seems* to give the phone the *tiniest* of boosts.So, it depends on how much you're willing to sacrifice for a tiny, and almost imperceptible boost in signal strength (if there even is one; the boost I noticed could easily be a product of my hopeful imagination).As for me, I wouldn't buy one again."
1,nothing to review,would love to give a review but i never recieved item to know if it works or not. i've since changed phone carriers so i no longer need it.
2,Generac Poor Quality,When my generator starts - it quits for several seconds and restarts. The company can't solve the problem and does not answer my letters.If you can't live by your warranty you should not sell it.
5,The right place at the right time!,"This insane drama serves as an apt soundtrack to the many stupid, silly and sublime events one might experience any day. I have noticed that their back catalog (or perhaps I should say forward catalog) is available: http://home.bluemarble.net/~lodeston/firesign.html is a page about firesign that has info. The Firesign Theatre's robust mannerisms and corny elan root them firmly in the trenchant polylalia of improbable Americans like a disembodied Ziegfield's follies of the coney island of the mind of the radio the dog is listening to."
3,Waste of my money,"TOO cumbersome- I was hoping for a product that was more user friendly. This thing is heavy- and difficult to extend- and just too much trouble to use. I have used it 3 times in 6 months. Dog hates it, too- but he's older. A younger dog would probably do OK with it. If you've got the muscles and time- it might work for you. But it does take some time & effort to get it into position & take it down again. I would not reorder this product."
5,Fat chicks Rule!,I picked up Lara Frater's wonderful book and I'm so happy I did. This is a great book for the fat chick. It's filled with awesome advice and info.
5,Charming and sweet,Much more original design than it appears in the photo. I love mine and it makes me feel younger. Tks.
4,"Which, of the 2, is the better book?","I have read both books about the Edwards family & each has it's own merit. The main thing is that they tell the story of an extraordinary individual that wanted to carve out his own place on earth without the help of hardly anyone & certainly not the help of any government. He also saved a specie from almost curtain extinction, the Trumpeter Swan, and that alone should make him a hero to anyone who has ever seen one of these magnificent birds. After reading this book & "" Grass Beyond the Mountain"" I went to this Area of B.C. & came away with renewed respect for these people."
4,A Very Good CD,"A very good first effort (or is it second?). Very simple and catchy tunes. But let's be honest, putting just 29 minutes of songs on a cd that can hold 70 minutes worth of music is an inefficient use of natural resources (not cool)."
5,"The best, easiest to read book out there!","I ordered this book 4 months ago and I have recomended it to every one of my friends. The Q & A format allowed me to get all of the answers to the questions I had, and the ones I hadn't thought of as well. It is extremely easy to understand."
4,COUNTRY SOUND AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD,"I AM SO PROUD TO OWN THIS ALBUM. FANTASTIC MELODIES, PURE AND CLEAR GUITAR SOUND. LAY LADY LAY ONE OF THE CLASSIC SONGS FROM THE NASHVILLE LAND WHERE COUNTRY MUSIC HAS BEEN BORN TO FAME. VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED NOT ONLY FOR COUNTRY MUSIC FANS, BUT FOR THOSE WHO ALSO WISH A GOOD MEMORY FROM THE 196O'S. PURCHASE IT AS SOON AS POSSOBLE."
2,"If you want flowers, ask a florist","Nashville Skyline is straightforward, easy-rolling, upbeat country guitar. It could have been enjoyable, but unfortunately it comes from a genius in introspective, turbulent, political and emotional statements. Dylan just doesn't know how to be cheerful without also being thoroughly irritating."
2,Only if you like his voice on this one.,This cd is very unessential in my mind. I've heard a few sound clips and his voice is very weird. I would like to have this because country Dylan sounds like a good idea but he messed up things when he changed his voice around. On lay lady lay I think he trys to sound to much like Johnny Cash. So then before buying I would listen to a few sound clips because this is not normal Dylan.Peace out to all my freak out friends!
4,Achieves Its Purpose,"No, ""Nashville Skyline"" is not Dylan's best work. It's uncomplicated listening that--under 30 minutes--is little more than fluff. It is, however, instrumentally lively and lyrically solid. And that voice... Let's not even go there. Can anyone put a thumb on this man? The only problem I have is with that opening duet with Johnny Cash. This thing sounds like two drunks howling at the moon. It would have been better on ""Self Portrait."" But as a 'country album' and testament to Dylan's chameleon image, ""Nashville Skyline"" hits the mark."
3,My son was bored with it quickly,"This is truly old school Pooh. It's cute, but didn't hold my 21 month old's attention for very long - the color illustrations are not current or vibrant enough & the story is over very quick. Pooh get's stuck in the door because he eats too much honey & it takes them a week to pull him out - questionable story line -"
5,Very helpful!,"This book offers great advice. It covers topics that I hand't even thought of that one would need when trying to rent out their property. Also, it offers ""sample"" leases, deposit forms, credit check forms which I was able to just copy and use for when I rented out my property. I definitely recommend this book."
5,Funny and very readable,"I started to read this book last night and I could not put it down. Yes, I was reading this Landlord book, not some mystery novel. This book is funny, easy to understand, full of great examples and anecdotes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,Landlording,"it's a good book for people that bought a houses one for themselves and otherone for renting without any idea what so ever of what they get them self into, how it works, where to begin, what to do to pay a loan, etc."
1,AWFUL! Get Every Landlord's Legal Guide by Marcia Stewart Instead,"I bought both this book and Nolo's Every Landlord's Legal Guide thinking they would address different things. I really wish I didn't waste my time reading Landlording! It's verbose and wastes 75% of the book (and your time) trying to be cute with silly examples. The information is in there but you have to weed through a morass of text just to get to it. I couldn't believe how much more succinct and effective Every Landlord's was, providing ALL the same information with none of the bs. And that comes with a free CD of all the documents you'll need. I agree with the other reviewers that the information is useful. But there are much better ways to get at it. If you don't believe me, go to a bookstore and look before you buy."
3,"Good, but not great retelling of a fascinating tale","How do you turn 19 episodes of powerfully written, acted and directed telecinema into a pocket book? It's not an easy job, but Ms. Clark makes a credible effort, using the scripts and some fill-in material as the basis for much of this novella. Just seeing Angela on the cover is an inspiration, and some interesting bio material on the actors, writers and directors makes the book worth having. Winnie Holzman gets some well deserved credit for some superb script writing that helps the book come to life. It's certainly a must for anyone who appreciated this short-lived gem of television at its best. The on-screen promise may have died half unfulfilled, but at least the book lives on."
3,For those of you who never saw the series...,"...or forget what they *did* see of it, don't bother buying the book. TV tie-ins are only interesting if you've seen the show, and this one is no exception. It seems to gloss over a lot of things, and leaves the reader feeling unfulfilled. I imagine if I had seen every episode, I would have appreciated it, but to those who haven't - don't bother reading this."
1,Not please with this item,"Well here it is flu season and my daughter gets sick. So I go to check her temperature, so I can tell the Dr. what it is.. 101.9 holly cow, so I wait a few minutes and re-take it 100.2 okay, then a few minutes later 97.8.. Okay something wrong here, so I use a different one same thing and I even tried it on myself.. Needless to say the best route even though this way seems easier is the old fashioned thermometer.. You and your childs health is not something to mess with and if you are going to invest in digital ask your Dr. or pharmasist to recommend one."
5,Window Into Recent Middle East History and Sufis,"""Over five decades ago, I made the first journeys recorded in this book. Now that this half-century is over, I am freed from the promises made then to avoid certain names and topics.""John Grant opens windows onto two mysterious worlds: that of recent middle eastern history and that of the Sufis. Through Grant, we meet both the aged wife of a courtier of the Turkish Sultan, and a close associate of Ataturk, creator of modern secular Turkey, among many other fascinating characters. And, we travel with him on a Sufi mission to advise groups that have mistaken habit and emotion for the search for truth."
2,So so odor control,"This product was not especially effective at masking odor. We prefer ""air therapy"" orange scent -- which does a much better job."
4,I didn't know I ordered the Honeysuckle,"The product was great and came in a timely fashion. This is not the exact same honey dust I have used in the past. The only difference is the flavor. I was looking to order the original. Other than my own lack of attention to detail, I was very pleased with this purchase."
4,where are the rest of mitch millers sing alongs on cd,i bought this to add to the other cds i have of mitch. the only thing that needs to be done is to have the complete catalogue of sing along with mitch albums on cd. i have all the sing along albums except 2 or 3 i think and i put them on cd but for mitch miller fans it's time to put them out and sit back and enjoy them. well maybe one day it will happen who knows. the main mitch cd to get is the first one to start off with simply sing along with mitch and the gang. you won't be disapointed.
5,Cold Blood - Sisyphus - Hot Damn Fun!,"Jazz-Rock, was an ill-fated concept that withered on the vine pretty quickly, but there were intermittent starbursts of inspiration. Sisyphus is hot fun with good songwriting to boot, not a typical strength of jazz-rock bands of the day. The opener, Shop Talk, is a thrilling instrumental that keeps you on the edge as it builds and shifts gears, upping the ante 'till the last note. Funky On My Back is exemplary songcraft with an unforgettable hook, elegantly arranged and played - seductive and witty. Ever the lesser compositions have strong hooks and heart pumping energy that rivals James Brown. The late Sandy McKee's drumming crackles with unbearable energy and his surprise cymbal grabs are very much his own. I confess that I am not a patient listener and don't give much time to music that doesn't spark my pipe. Cold Blood manages to grab me and hold me to the end with very little effort from myself."
3,Good,These books were given as a gift to my family members. I looked at the books before giving them and like them
1,Broken merchandise,"Out of the 100 DVD cases I received, I'd say nearly half of them were broken or unusable. I'm very disappointed. I see that I'm not the only one to complain about this so I'm guessing this wasn't a fluke."
1,Not Premium DVD Cases - Watch video to see what you get.,"Length:: 0:40 MinsI received these dvd cases with several damaged, out of 100 - 19 were damaged. Also the PREMIUM cases are anything but premium. They are brittle, onion skin thin clear covers and the plastic smells bad as well. NOT PREMIUM quality."
1,Very Disapointed,"Was Very Disapointed with these Cases.They were very chealy made. Of the whole case, there were at least 30 or more that were broken or so cheaply made they broke after they were opened and closed not more than two or three times. Most of the time just opening them the first time, the clips snaped off and the case wouldn't stay closed.I had purchased this box for back up stock and had it for three months or more before I opened it, so I couldn't return it."
3,"Cheap, both in price and quality!","These cases are cheap! Some do not close properly without a little effort. Others have broken when opened. I kind of expected this at the price, however. They were very inexpensive to purchase but the quality has been poor at best. I have found that I am throwing out about 1 out of every 10 of them. If you can find something of better quality for similar price or do not mind paying more, go that route!"
3,Decent deal for the price paid,"The order arrived well ahead of the predicted delivery date. Unlike many here, I did not have a single broken case. They are a little flimsy as has been noted, but for backup storage, I'm just fine with that. Also, I do note the interesting odor. It's not super strong on a single case basis, but when all 100 are together, yeah, you do notice it."
2,Definitely run-of-the-mill,"To put this very simply, if you want a black metal band that combines the elements from many others, this is it. We have similar drum production to Enslaved's ""Eld"", similar vocals to every other black metal group, guitar riffs that certainly lack in ANYthing resembling originality, and none of it done with enough power to make it in any way distinctive. Basically, if you're looking for black metal, you'll definitely find it here. If you're looking for original or unique black metal, best look elsewhere."
4,Informative!,"This book offers a comprehensive overview of computer forensics and demystifies what computer forensics examiners really do. It is a stimulating way in to the subject. I enjoy most reading about collecting evidence by capturing data images (e.g. creating the bit stream copy or forensic duplicate) and finding hidden data on hard disk (e.g. in file slack space, swap file, or from encrypted plain text information in digital image)."
1,Do not buy this book,This book is a waste of time and money. Please do not buy this book you will regret spending your money...
5,Speak english like an american,It was Fun and very instruktive and I was offen reminded of my das with IBM which I spent in an only english speaking departmentgreatly enjoied it!
2,Not Very Memorable,"I have read this twice. But only because I found it in my attic and could not remember how it ended the first time. I thought I had not finished it, but when I finished it the second time I knew I had.That should tell you something!But its readable enough. A story of struggle against a tyrannical regime. It has some good ideas and interesting moments. Just not enough of them!"
1,City Drags On,"I saw this movie a few years ago and it was terrible. The story makes no sense, the movie is very slow, the editing is terrible...just about everything in it is terrible. The one semi bright spot is the performance by LA area comedian, John ""JJ"" Williams. His performance is over the top, a bit hamhanded and borderline painful, but at least he makes you laugh on purpose. If you have a choice between this flick and hammering a nail in to your forehead, I'd pick up the hammer and get to work."
4,One Swell Reader!,"Ryan loves to play soccer (eventhough he might get distracted sometimes on the field)...and his mom loves to go to his games. Unfortunately she's often a little over-enthusiastic. Ryan gets a little embarassed. He cooks up a plan to trick his mom...and then (along with the rest of the team) misses her when he thinks she's not there.This is a great Easy Reader for a good first grade reader or an average second grade reader. ESPECIALLY if they love soccer.Cute & expressive pencil illustrations add to the fun. It even covers the thorny subjects of honesty and (obviously) being embarassed over the actions of a parent in language any second grader can understand.(Soccer Mom's will ""aww"" at then end...and their little players won't mind!)"
1,Blower motor,It was not a direct fit needed modifications to get it to fit. was not as advertised as a direct replacement.
1,yuck!,"I guess I should have read the reviews first, my bad. I don't take my coffee with sugar simply because I don't like it sweet the syrup said sugar free but I wish it had said in the description that it had splenda in it as this made my coffee sweet and not how I like it at all."
1,Great product but way cheaper elsewhere,"Agree with the previous review, at this price I have 2 bottles coming from Lollicup including shipping...great item, terrible pricing."
4,Perfect for DW fans,"Although the fez is definitely cheaply made, it's good quality for the price and served me well this past Halloween. I simply cut off the yellow stringy bit and stuck it on my head with a flourish whilst waving around my sonic screwdriver and shouting ""RUN!""."
2,Cheaply Made,"I had expected a bit more when I ordered this product. When I first examined it I got the feeling I could have made this myself at a lower expense. It looks fine and serves its purpose, but I won't be surprised when it is no longer usable."
2,"""super-strong magnets"" are not strong at all","I bought these for my son thinking that they would be easy to build with, since the magnets would hold things in place while he was building. Unfortunately, they don't. I tried building some of the shapes on the box and they were falling apart before I even finished - even simple shapes like the cube. It was frustrating for me; I imagine it would be close to impossible for a child."
1,What a waist of money!,The magnetic is not strong and you cannot build with it as it falls over. The picture is decieving What a waist of money! Don't buy it!
2,"Cute, but...","These would be fun, but the magnets are too weak and the structures fall apart very easily. I will return these and get the Magnetos set instead."
1,Terrible!,"This toy is horrible! The magnets are really weak and the balls are heavy, so it's impossible to build anything 3-dimensional. No way could we build anything like what is on the package. An adult can't make it work, so how could a toddler do it? I'm returning it asap."
2,Not that great actually,"So, I bought this scale because despite the bad reviews previously given, I thought maybe the commenters were disenchanted. I fortunately went to the doctor the day before and weighed in a 117. The scale the NEXT DAY said I was 125. Then I get off, get back on, 111. That's not a slight difference. Then, I try it again, no reading at all. An hour later, no reading. I will not be stressed out by a scale, I sent it back to Amazon already. I will go with a basic scale for now."
3,5 stars SPARC / 0 stars x86 content,"Just passed the 310-200 exam which covers SPARC, x64, and x86 based systems.This book's coverage of the SPARC content is in depth, on the other hand the x64 and x86 coverage little more that footnotes.Two thumbs up SPARC content, two thumbs down on x64 & x86 content."
3,Not bad.,As far as i know it seems pretty decent. its not as big as i expected but the compartments and zipper to open up the whole pack make it more efficient.
4,Moon Has Left the Sky,"Claudia Russell'sSong Foodknocked my socks off, particularly the lovely ballad ""Weakness."" A bit after the fact, I realize that ""Ready to Receive"" was released several years ago. Her song ""Galesburg"" smokes like the ache after last call, ""The train has left the station & the moon has left the sky; There ain't nothin' left inside of me, There ain't nothin' left to try."" Russell has an expressive voice that trills with energy as on ""He Ain't Coming Back,"" a bluesy talk-sing with Russell's voice moaning on the chorus. Claudia's take on Bob Dylan's ""Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You"" has a breathless anticipation with Andy Ratliff's banjo pulsing joyfully. ""Bugs"" is one of the most unusual songs I've heard recently, ""Please don't eat my beans."" ""Miss Fortune"" shines with a lovely plaintive melody, ""I dreamed that my life was joyful & gay, but this time misfortune has come to stay."" ""Ready to Receive"" is a good sophomore set from this very talented singer. Enjoy!"
1,PHONE CASE,"MAGNET WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP IT CLOSED, PHONE FELL OUT 5 TIMES ON THE GROUND IN A MATTER OF 2 HRS."
4,Worth the Effort,"This collection focuses on desperate, self-destructive characters masquerading as studious, meek individuals. The textures of these lives, presented in Straubs gentle tones, really demolish all preconceptions about introverts. What's most interesting is how their bravery, their willingness to stare horror in the face, is ultimately what is self-destructive. Strange. ""Blue Rose"" reads like a primer on the construction of a serial killer's personality. And both ""The Buffalo Hunter"" and ""Mrs. God"" have protagonist's more bent on experiencing weirdness than self-preservation. Straub excels at psychological horror."
2,Top Heavy,We ditched these after a few years even though they were still in excellent condition because the handles are so heavy at the top that they don't stand up in a pot. If you need to leave it in a pot for a few seconds it will flip itself out and onto the floor. A really bad design in my opinion due to that. Otherwise they were great and stood the test of time.
2,Oh Please....,"I wrote a review for the European import, so I'm putting a warning in here. You can get 10 mediocre songs that sound nothing like they used to for 20-something dollars from Europe, or for 30-something dollars, you can get 11 of these songs from Japan. Just say bonus track? Just say pass."
5,"Love these for big soup pots (and others) with ""ear"" handles and/or lids--or paired with an Orca silicone mitt.","No pot holder does it all, but this may well have a place in your kitchen. This design is worth cosidering because of several special features:* non-absorbent material means you never have to worry about stains OR wetness conducting heat* design works especially well with ""ear"" shaped handles, or the helper handle on a large saute pan* excellent for use as a ""pusher/grabber"" with an Orca mitt to remove a large item from the oven without burning the ""inside"" hand--use the Orca mitt on the INSIDE hand, of course...* handy to leave atop the cover of a large pot simmering on the stovetop...This is not only handy, it's cute. Since I received them as gifts, I have several colors. My favorite is the red, because it's hard to lose."
3,I've read better,"I read this book for a college report, and, like most of my class, didn't much care for it. The tale itself, though coming close to historical accuracy, is bland and dry. The characterization is not developed or presented in an interesting way, and, in essence, it's a book by a man for male readers. There is little depth. There is also much repetition. For example, chapter three, page 12: ""Okonkwo did not have the start in life which many young men usually had."" Page 13: ""With a father like Unoka, Okonkwo did not have the start in life which many young men had."" It is difficult to relate in any way emotionally to the characters, especially Okonkwo, and such makes it difficult to really care what happens to them. From a historical perspective, this book is worth reading to learn how the British colonization of Africa effected the Africans, but I wouldn't recommend it for enjoyment."
1,CAUTION! DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!,"This was the absolute WORST book I've ever read in my life. My English teacher made me read it over the summer and I hated it. It's this boring hard to understand book about this guy in Nigeria just livin' his life. Then he accedentally kills this kid and is sent into excile for seven years. These people come from Europe trying to make the people more civilized and become Christians. So this guy gets mad when he comes back from exile. While they were at a meeting trying to figure out what to do, a messenger comes and the guy gets mad and shoots him. Then he goes home and hangs himself. All of that happens in the three hundred pages. It was an awful book and I would not suggest it to anyone. I wish I could give it no stars. Yeah, it was that bad."
1,"The titile of this book should be ""Tragedy of a Moron""","This book is a total piece of junk, I have to read it because my college class. Just a story about a group of stupid people. The story talk about a stupid abusive man who murder a white guy for no reason then kill himself.If you think it is a good book because it talk about white guy colonize black African.The reaction of those Africans are stupid too.I am from Hong Kong when white guys colonize our city, everyone was happy and keep making more money.Don't Buy this Book!"
4,Summer Reading,BeforeI began reading 'Thing's Fall Apart' I logged on to websites like Amazon.com and read reviews of the book I had to read for summer reading. I initially thought the the book to be dry and boring but after a couple of chapters I started to really enjoy it and did not want it to end. I can agree with other reviewers who say the book had long words but the dictionary in the end of my book really helped.
4,A Tale of an Angry Soul,"This book started out slow for me and it did not pick up until part two. I found all the different African names confusing and hard to keep up with. Overall the main character, Okonkwo, was quite depressing. I wish Okonkwo's daughter, Enzinma, character would have been developed more. Enzima was my favorite character throughout the entire story.Even though the beginning was a somewhat rough to get through, I like how the story developed. Okonkwo was such a complex character. His childhood demons followed him all his life. It was like a dark cloud hovered over his emotions. Personally, I believe that Okonkwo's broken spirit led to his horrible death. The ending really pierced me."
4,from the depths of pre-colonial Africa,"First Achebe guides us through a people's traditions and way of life, then depicts how another culture intrudes and attempts to reform these people out of their own impression of what culture should be. Achebe shows us that no one culture can determine what each individual or tribe perceives to be a way of life, and a spirit of a people and the stories that they can tell will transcend all else."
2,"Informative, but Bad","This book is just a fictional text book. The first 100-150 pages are just information that is not important in the long run. We finally get to the plot after 150 pages, but by then it has taken too long.If you want to be put to sleep, please read this book. If you want no real plot, please read this book. If you want a text book on African culture, read this book. If you want a good book that keeps you interested all the way through, read something like Elie Weisel's Night. Just don't read this book."
3,"Interesting, but So What?","The book is well written, and it presents a very good view of life of tribal Africa (given the fact that I know nothing of the subject) and the inevitable tragedies that result from the combination of culture clashes and ignorance. However, I don't get the point - I don't feel like I gained anything from the book except a view on African tribal life. In addition, the story is little different from the clash of westerners and Native Americans - same stories, different continent."
2,Simplistic,"I thought this book was very simple. True, there's a lot of symbolism and deep thoughts between the lines, but I was not impressed. It was, however, a great African look at an African life, which is unique. It doesn't deserve to be called a classic, but the story is pure and a great experience to read."
1,I hated it.,"I had to read this book a couple months ago, and I hated it. It may have been that I was forced to read it but I don't think so. I couldn't get into any of the characters. They were all just so bland and unemotinal. Don't buy this unless you need it for some reason out of your control."
2,Just not interested,"I read 3/4 of the book then stopped. The main character is driven by the need to succeed and in their primitive culture it is somewhat interesting to see how things unfold for him. The main point I took away is that in a stone-age culture there is a lot of randomness; maybe one day some one comes and says you must take in a 10 year old boy, then years later they come by and say he must die, or maybe a witchdoctor comes and takes your daughter for a night. The author has some skill and some of the folk stories were interesting, but I found I just did not care about the characters. So I stopped reading. I rarely stop a book 3/4 of the way through."
2,not terrible but rather dull,"I read this recently for a university African Lit class (though I am 40 yrs old), and found it rather dull and uninspired. I realize that its simplicity is parts of its appeal, but it felt overly simplistic to me. Some memorable passages for sure but the writing just did not resonate with me. The message is worthwhile but the writing not so much.In fact, this is one of the least interesting books I've read so far in the African Lit class. Much prefer Ngugi's ""Grain of Wheat"" and Mahfouz's great ""Miramar"" (though it's not sub-Saharan Africa)."
1,This has to be the WORST book I've ever read!!!!!!!!,"For you out there with nothing to do with your day, this book might be one one to pass time. But, if your a college student this book is a total waste of time. I was forced to read it for history class and it like shooting myself in the foot every page. Almost nothing happens for the first 100 pages except we find out that he has three wives and he beats his kids. GREAT, That took 100 pages to say!!"
2,analyzed to boringsville,"I'm sure that if i hadn't had to write a paper, and analyze every word in the story, i would have been ok with this book. Unfortunately i was forced to did deeper into a book which did not suite my interests and i came to the conclusion that the book had nothing intellectually stimulating to offer and it was a generally boring book. If you think you can make it through, or if this genre interests you, by all means read it....but if you have any doubts, dont analyze every word, it ruins the fun."
2,Bored to death,Not something I would read if I didn't have to. Reading for class and not enjoying it. I'm going to watch the 50 Cent movie once I'm done and compare it to the book. The movie can't suck as bad as this does.
5,book talk,"Just finishing reading ""Things Fall Apart"" by Chinua Achebe a fascinating book described as ""the archetypal modern African novel"":<...>Was really surprised by the number negative responses to the book at goodreads:<...>So it seems like people really respond differently to the book. I loved it. And think it contains a wealth of topics to discuss.Did you read it? What was your response to it? Would really enjoy discussing this book with people who have an opinion.I've started a discussion on this book here:<...>Would enjoy your input."
4,A resplendent read!,"Okonkwo changes and adapts throughout Things Fall Apart; he becomes a symbol for the entire tribe, as many traits of the Ibo tribe are reflected in the character of Okonkwo. Like Okonkwo, the Ibo tribe is not concerned about prophecies, only actions and strength. Okonkwo many time loses sight of the line drawn by the tribe, and is perpetually breaking its law. Perhaps the greatest difference between Okonkwo and his village is their abilities to forgive. Okonkwo is exigent and allows little flexibilities when it comes to his rules, whereas the Ibo tribe itself has forgiven Okonkwo time and time again."
4,a good book,I am glad i didn't have to read this book in high school. i probably wouldn't have liked it back then. but now i did enjoy it. it is easy to read and understand. i liked to read about the tribal life and i think Okonokwo is a great character. he has so many faults and yet with time one grows to like him.
2,Things Fall Apart,"Two things I liked about this book was that Okonkwo was a brave and fearce man, and I like that Okonkwo was a pimp in his on way.Two things I didn't like about the book was that I couldn't pronounce some of the names, and the way the book ended.I think this book should not be read in school due the violence and killing."
1,Juvenile and lacking substance,"I was forced to read this for a college intro to lit class and it was terrible. Not only is it written in a Juvenile manner, but the characters are annoying to read about. This story could have been told in about 20 pages, but streches out into a full book that finally makes a point in the very last pages. Achebe's work needs some fine tuning."
1,ugh,"I read this twice for college lit and I can't stand it. It was slightly better the second time around but that didn't make me enjoy it any more. I completely disagree with missionaries coming in and slaughtering cultures in the name of ""salvation"" so, it's not a fun read for me."
3,"An in-depth look at another culture,but very universal theme","Things Fall Apart was a well-written novel, and gave me a very nice change of pace since the culture was so different from my own. I liked the story but it dragged at times, and some of Okonkwo's actions seemed without reason. I can thoroughly understand however, why this novel is so widely read. It is because of the many universal themes that I feel, as humans, we can all benefit from reading about."
3,"not great, not awful","now, i see where achebe was going with ""things fall apart."" i understand that it is an answer to ""heart of darkness"" and it was good for what it was.here's the thing though...i didn't like either book. ""heart of darkness"" was an awfully dense and boring 80 pages that took me forever to struggle through, and while ""things fall apart"" was an easier read, it was no more interesting or exciting.i read ""things fall apart"" in AP literature after having read ""heart of darkness"" and i think that that is most likely the only situation in which i can imagine reading ""things fall apart"" or ""heart of darkness"" for that matter. neither are good books to sit down and read for fun or enjoyment, but as books to discuss in a class setting, they are fine."
5,Achebe's Presentation,"Things Fall Apart is the first of the four African novels that I've read, and it struck me as a wonderful novel, concentrating more on the society more than character. Although the character development was thorough and in depth, the society becomes more important to the reader. Okonkwo is truly an intriguing character throughout the book, using his lazy father as a motivational device to be more than good in anything. Achebe stays true to the African perspective, but really is not biased in any way. It is for the reader to decide and determine their own feelings."
3,Tough to get through,"I have heard this is supposed to be one of those life changing books that EVERYONE should read. I had significant trouble getting through it and finally had to give it up for now. It is supposed to get better towards the end, but getting there is very difficult. I will try again next summer after school is out and I have more time to digest it."
4,Things Fall Apart,"Things Fall Apart is about a man named Okonko, who is struggling to cope with the changes in his society. This is the story of a man during the begining of British colonization of Africa. The British come to Nigeria and begin to disrupt the age-old patterns of African village, culture. Although the British are dominating towards the small Nigeria village, they cultivate Western civilization. Okonko is a character depicted as a greatest man. However, he is an angry, inflexible man. Okonko allowed fear to rule his life and this eventually lead to his sad demise. This book was very interesting and formative it expressed the tradition and long held beliefs of African culture, but also reflected the differences of Western culture."
4,Book Review,"It was for my daughter for a high school class and she's rating it a 4, that's all I know about it."
4,great book!!,"Great book, great book, great book!!! All should read, very inspiring and opens up the realities about culture and beliefs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Things Fall Apart,This book was recommended by someone who knew the author and it was a very insightful read. Strongly recommended for anyone who wants to know more about African customs and some of the effects Christian missionaries had on them.
1,It sucked!!!,"Worst book I've ever read. Try Green Eggs & Ham, Cat in the Hat, The Lorax, or anything else worth reading.Sincerely,Theodor Seuss Geisel"
3,Things Fall Apart,"This is a good book, though not overly exciting. The African culture shown is quite interesting but the plot is rather dull. This book is well written with a lot going on for literary discussion.( i.e. strong irony.) I would suggest this book to those interested in African culture; or as a good text to be analyzed for content/author style/etc."
3,It's a very good book,"I really like the book. The reason why I rated the book a 3 is because I don't really get the title of the story. It says, Things Fall Apart but I didn't get why and how did the things fall apart? Please give me explanaton because I want to really understand the book so I can help my little brother when it next year. Please send it. Thank you!"
2,Set for 4-7 year olds only,"I did a bunch of research and thought that this was the best bet for a family set. Boy, was I wrong. Now I have to ship it back to Ace (partnered with Amazon). This set is really tiny. Look at the dimensions of this versus other sets before choosing it. We had a really cheap set from Cost Plus - that set was at least 4-5 inches longer than this flimsy one. If you are looking for a family set that older kids or adults would use, this is definitely NOT the set. Back to square one for me. Not sure what other set we'll go with, but definitely ont this one."
4,Nice set for the price!,"We bought this set for use at a birthday party. The adults played it more than the kids and were quite amusing to watch as they seemed more interested in roqueting than actually getting their balls through the wickets. Overall, a good set for the price. My only complaint is that the mallets do not fit in the bag when assembled so you have to take the head off to pack it all up when done playing."
4,Croquet set,"I got this for my 6-year old grand daughter so at least she & I could play. It was a good buy for the age and price. The ""most helpful review"" I saw before purchacing suggested using a good wood glue to cement the mallets to the screw in handles. When this item arrived I looked at the the male & female threads and it was clear that these wouldn't stay together long (as noted in some of the negative reviews I read). Well I did the wood glue thing - and no it doesn't all fit in the carry bag well anymore - but it's not like we're traveling to tournaments with the thing - It's just at my house and my yard. The wickets are a bit puny expecially in my hard south Georgia clay ground area but, if you're careful, not a problem. All in all, if you 1st use the wood glue to FIX the mallets to the mallet handles, it's a real good kid's set at a real good price."
3,Croquette set,"This is a cheap set...and you get what you pay for. Functional, but if I were to buy another set I'd spend a little more to get something made a little better."
4,review,"I bought this as a gift for one of my friends and she LOVES IT!!! the game is alot of fun, i guess if your a gray's fan (I AM NOT) So i am not very good but i still have fun playing. If you are a grays fan or know a grays fan get it."
2,Choking Hazard and difficult for small hands,"The top piece, the blue one pictured, is small enough to be a choking hazard. Just FYI. We removed that piece and threw it away.Also, the pole and the hole are small requiring really really good fine motor skills. For babies just learning this skill look for bigger poles and holes otherwise, it's really hard for them to do this one."
1,PAINT COMES OFF IN A MATTER OF SECONDS,"THEY MUST PAINT THESE TOYS WITH WATER COLOR, HONESTLY WITH IN A MATTER OF MINUTES HALF OF THE RINGS ARE ALMOST JUST THE COLOR OF THE WOOD."
2,Nice stacker,"My 18 month old had outgrown some of his early stacker toys and really enjoys wooden toys so I thought this would be a good choice. I have to say that although I have not had any trouble with paint or color coming off of the one we bought, I would probably not bought it after reading the reviews here. That said, I have and NO problem. My son throws the pieces (of course he does)and even when they hit the tile floor, I have seen no cracking or chipping. The colors seem fast and do not rub off on any of hte other pieces. My son really enjoys stacking these and we are enjoying going over the colors as he plays. I will say that the red ball for the top is pretty hard for him to get on. I would absolutely buy this again and am glad I got it. I do not let my child play with it unattended or walk with the stick. I am afraid of him getting poked.As an update, two of the rings have cracked and I have thrown it away for fear of pinching little fingers."
3,wooden toy stacker,"Although smaller than I expected, this toy is beautifully painted wood and has the potential to be a great learning toy. We could not however get past the ring holder. It just seems like it could be a real hazard if our child fell on it, or hit themselves with it. So we set that aside and let her play with the wooden rings by themselves. They are still stackable without the ring holder and she loves playing with them. This was our 1st time buying Melissa and Doug, and I didn't really see the big deal about their toys with this toy. We've since bought other Melissa and Doug toys that have exceeded our expectations and now I see why they are considered a great company."
1,save your money,"i bought this for my baby, based on the bright colors and being melissa & doug, i thought i would have no qualms with it.threw it away. paint chips, the wooden stacker pole scares me, she would put it in her mouth, i was so afraid of it impaling her or injuring her mouth. no thanks...this toy lasted less than a month in our house."
2,Ordinary Differeintial Equations,"I have Professor Saperstone as a math professor this semester for ODE which is why we used this book. There are no strong points of the book which I can say make it worth buying. Many of the sections are out of order, there 12 pdf pages of errata in the 1st edition, and some of the difficult concepts are explained in odd ways. For example, when explaining graphical analysis he did a long explaination of the preditory prey modeling which made the analysis quite difficult to understand. After a few hours I realized what he was trying to teach me was what I had learn in algebra II. It was really frustrating."
4,A handy book,"This is well researched book on pest control methods for those who don't want to use traditional OTC commercial pesticides. As a professional horticulturist, I have used many of pesticide types and am happy to have this book as a reference for other pest control options. This is a must have for the home gardner and home owner who would rather opt out of the toxic pesticide cycle."
4,absorbing from the start,"if I have any complaint about the book it was that it's too short. hungry for more, but understand why it ended when it did."
2,Curves a New Way,Follow the directions and you will make perfect circles and curves very easily with no fuss or stress. The 6 minute circle is true. You can really make a quilt with multiple perfect circles quickly. I was not happy about using glue. But it works and is worth using.
1,Do Not Recommend,Using this is too difficult. It definitely takes both hands and a lot of finagling to get the top and bottom lined up and hooked in. I'm getting a different gate.
2,Not Practical,"There is no way you will ever get this gate open with a baby in your arms. It is aesthetically well designed and flows well in the house since it rolls up nicely. However, it is not practical for a high/moderate traffic area of the house. We have it covering a large opening from the kitchen and constantly end up with either the top or the bottom hook attached but rarely both.The problem with the install is not complexity but rather precision. I finally got the install right after 3 holes in the wall. It is tricky since you really have to accurately line up the hooks in order to get good tension on both the top and bottom. If you don't have a level and measuring tape you will end up with a few holes in the wall/door."
5,Adorable Highchair,We orginally wanted the Expressions highchair from Evenflo--but they were sold out. I actually liked this one better. Our 4-1/2 month old daughter loves looking at the chair pad. It is very eye catching. Definetly not plain!!It was so easy to put together. So far-- we haven't found anything wrong with it. Well-- it doesn't roll very good on carpet--but hey what casters do. I wish it came with a mat to put underneath--but I think that comes separate.
3,Great for pattern drafting,"I found this to be a great book for the person who loves to draft patterns. Being a costume/fashion design student and an excellent pattern drafter, the books instructions are very easy to follow and understand. Although it gives somes tips on contstruction in certain areas of the garment, I wish books of this nature would offer more construction information."
2,Poor design,"Do not expect this to work as advertised. Altho it is made of metal, the design consists of 2 structural pieces on the outside, held together by flimsy/flexible metal rod/wire(?) that's supposed to be the rack. Once bottles are loaded, the rack caves in from the weight. And getting two to stack on top of each other? - even worse idea. Luckily I don't drink expensive bottles, so if a bottle does decide to fall out one day, it wouldn't hurt too bad. But if you actually value your bottles, get something sturdier."
2,Just OK,"The size is what I wanted, but it delivers very little cooling air. I put it in my bathroom wndow when showering."
5,Great stuff for strings and fun activities!,"I use this to help cut down on pick noise and slide noise when recording.It was also Great fun when my children were little..I would spray this on the linoleum floor and the kids,and myself on occasion while wearing socks and with a little running start, would slide super fast the entire length of the floor, which was approximately 20 feet! If you plan on trying this, Please be careful! It is literally slicker than ice!"
4,Interesting product,"I was hoping this product would eliminate string ""talking"" and had mixed results. It helped some but didn't get rid of the noise entirely. It also makes the strings feel nice as well. I will continue to use it."
4,"Last time I bought it was 20 years ago, better the 2nd time","Fun, spirited. The stereo effects are fun. 20 years was too long to wait for the CD version. Good music to vacuum the house with, nice and loud."
4,love it,"I was surprised at how much my 18 month old and 3 year old like this set. The xylaphone is wooden and so makes a pretty hollow wood sound instead of an aweful lound clanking when the kids bang on it. They have to learn to BE QUIET and LISTEN better to hear the different notes, which I consider to be of great educational value! The mallets are nice and small and light-weight; although the square heads leave dents in the wooden ""keys"" - round would have been better, but maybe a gagging hazard with toddlers? The kazoo is a huge hit with ALL age kids who encounter it!The castanets are too big for my 18 month old's hands, but he loves the clacking wood sound if someone else uses them.I plan to get ""box 2"" eventually!"
1,Poor Timing Circuits,"All functions on units work fine except for the timer on circuit. Of the two unitspurchased, one unit only stays on one minute when set to the five minute setting.The other unit stays on three minutes when set to the five minute setting."
5,Works great!,I knew I had a small gas leak and this device confirmed exactly where I thought it was after a water heater install. Great tool!
2,"Works well, but cheap switch fails","I have purchased 5 of these detectors for my employees who are home inspectors. While the detector is accurate, the dial which functions as an on-off/volume switch is cheap. The dial's wheel is easily stripped. We have replaced these with more durable testers."
2,"Good probiotic, great price, wish it didn't have fillers.","I was taking these as part of an SCD/GAPS protocol for digestive repair. It's half the price of recommended probiotics which I couldn't afford to take and I love the high amount of bacteria and the variety of strains, but I can't keep justifying taking it seeing that it contains maltodextrin and other fillers which will impede on my healing overall. Disappointed."
3,"Good content, disastrous index.","Since other reviewers have not mentioned about the index of the book, I would like to add this: do not use this book if you are among the people who make an extensive use of index. The indes of this book is in the state of frustrating chaos, being disastrously flawed hence completely unusable. I suspect the proofreader was sleeping when reading the draft. As the content covers many topics in a leisurely, detailed and easy-to-read fashion, I really regret that the quality of the index terribly mars the real value of this book."
4,A Gentle Prairie Miracle of Love,"Summer is a young woman who has just buried her husband and four precious children. Alone and heartbroken, she takes a temporary job teaching in a home. She is not welcomed by the grandmother. The townspeople are Mennonite and do not want an outsider to reside in their town. Summer turns to God and to the only few friends she manages to make, and finds that God is, indeed, the God of second chances."
2,From Back Cover,"SHE WANTED SOME POINTERS...Catherine Harris can't think of a time she wasn't in love with Luke Van Buren. Unfortunatly, he's too stubborn to see it. He treats her like a kid sister and clearly doesn't see her as a woman. Cat tells Luke she wants to meet Mr. Right - with his help!HE WAS THE PERFECT TEACHER...Luke can't believe his bad luck. He's watched out for Cat for years. Now she's older and gorgeous, the feelings he has sure aren't brotherly! So when she asks him to teach her the art of seduction...well, he's more than a little reluctant.But when could he ever say no to Cat?"
4,Awesome Book!,"I greatly enjoyed this book! And, just as other reviewers have said, in no way am I a violent person or encourage violence between people. But, I still find this book enjoyable and would also recommend it to a friend. Though, I wish I had understood that this book is basically all seven comics condensed, which also meant that it would be missing bits and pieces from the original comics. But, with that said. This book is the story-line of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and what made it so enjoyable for me was its dark-humor, thought provoking situations, and dramatized silliness!This book fit my humor, which was why I bought it and why I recommend it to others with similar humor."
3,Missing stuff!!!!,"While I love this series, and was so excited to see it compiled together, I was completly bummed out when I realized they took stuff out! The guy pooping his pants on a date? Missing! And they make refs. to it in the rest of the story! Why in the heck is it gone?Otherwise, a fantastic story and collection."
4,Ineffable,Funny? To some perhaps. Meaningful? To some perhaps. Philosophical? To some perhaps. Why don't you read it and find out for yourself?
5,different,well i have to admit it was the best comic i have ever read . It is different than all the rest which is a reason it is so good.
5,Sickenly Fantastic,"This is one of the most wonderfully disgusting books out there. Although as a first time reader I found myself completely surprised by my first readthrough, I found myself rereading the book just to catch my 2nd and 3rd reactions. Not for the meek individual. You must have a spine to read this.."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"JTHM is quite famous, so I thought I'd check it out. It has some good points:- excellent artwork- occasionally extremely funnyHowever these are not enough to make it in any way worth reading. It is extremely violent, way past the point of being funny or interesting. It's really quite sick and seems very bitter about little things too. It takes a lot for me to not finish a book, and only American Psycho and JTHM have that honour. It's sick, vicious, over-the-top, bitter, pathetic, unfunny, and at times downright evil. Only finished half of it, and would not recommend to it anyone."
5,Amazing,"Parents, don't be alarmed this ""book"" is great for getting your kid to read- it not only gets into the mind of the author and ""NNY"", but it introduces more ideas about heaven and hell and the irony of life.I love this collection of all the JTHM comics. Being a fan of Slave Labor Graphics, this is probably one of the top 3 on my list."
4,Great machine,"I agree with other reviewers about this machine. I do like the range of motion on the Chi Energizer a bit better, but I enjoy the extra features on this one."
2,"Not bad, but not really up to par","I thought the art was reasonably well-done, though it ain't James O'Barr's drawing. The story wasn't all that bad, pretty original, but it seemed kinda stupid to me. I mean, Confederate soldiers reincarnated as a biker gang. Not really all that far-fetched, but why would the Crow wait that long? I mean, let's look at our past Crows...one year, months, weeks, days, same day... I guess, revenge requires a sense of timing too, though it really didn't work for me. I also didn't feel a lot of the emotion I felt with O'Barr's story. I guess, I'm so used to the lyricism and poetics of the original, that anything less just seems like crap to me. Anyway, this book is work a look, but I honestly do not think that any Crow comic will ever be as good as the original."
2,"Parents love it, kids could care less.","I bought two of these puzzles--one for my grandson (4) and nephew (5). Although, I found the puzzle to be helpful in teaching them how to tie shoes, their attention span with the puzzle lasted only a couple of minutes. They also got frustrated with not being able to take the pieces out withought untying the shoes."
5,Seriously... it's Thomas Keller....,"If you're buying this book.... you probably know who he is... of his work this is the simplest... and thank god it's still complex enough to be THOMAS KELLER. Cooking can be a trade or it can be an ART. Thomas Keller is amazing. The book is beautiful, colorful, and very well made. HUGE... don't expect it to sit nicely with your other books ;) but with the work that he does it feels suiting."
1,Same as above. I only received one bottle. Not what was pictured.,Same as above. I only received one bottle. Not what was pictured. They need to change the picture. Why do they show a spray bottle if they are not going to send it.
3,Poco (Legacy),"This is a good CD as all of Poco's albums are. They didn't start going downhill after the first three albums, they just kept getting better and better! The combination of Rusty Young and Paul Cotton is fabulous and made Poco what they are today."
4,Great photos,The book was great in it's explanations about what techniques to use for the best possible shot. I'll be using it's techniques from now on.
3,okay,"This book is a little disappointing. There is a lot of fluff in this book, meaning sentences like, 'From selecting the right lens to focusing, maximizing the depth of field and metering,family portraits present numerous technichal challenges that must be addressed be the professional photographer."" I guess I feel it is a lot of extra reading that is not necessary. The second half of the book gets better, so it is worth buying for some of the info it gives, but probably not worth the money that it costs."
5,Great genie lamp,Great lamp for our aladin costume. Very durable for kids.I would recommend it as it it good quality for kids or adults.
4,Metroid Pinball Review,"Great fun. I would be helpful to know how to do the wall jump thing. Any suggestions? I'm sure there are more areas I haven't unlocked yet, but I'll keep working on it. I just wish I could save the game, it takes awhile to get the first four tables and by the time I get to the artifact table, I usually have to stop."
1,Vinyl Quality Poor,"This is a great record by one of my favorite bands, but the treatment on this vinyl is obscene. When I played it I noticed that many of the songs sounded off and i realized that the horns weren't being included in the mix. We can't even hear the female vocalist on ""Can you take me higher."" ""Somebody's Watching You"" also gets hatched; all you can hear in the mix is the rhythm guitar. I checked my record player, I returned my copy for another and both had these flaws. Get this on CD, because it deserves a better quality listen then what is currently available here."
1,In my opinon the worst remaster ever,"This was the worst remaster job I have ever heard the bass is all but gone ,the person or persons who did this hack job did not understand the importance of the level of bass in the track Sex Machine it is suppose be the main focus and it is all but muted to it's lowest level with the vocals and other elements enhanced if you heard Sex Machine in it's era you will be greatly disappointed,Sex Machine was the reason I bought this CD and I was really let down when I played it."
2,Not really good but had to do.,"Very stiff, won't stay on head, just not the best. Every have a bowl or plate on your head? Thats what this felt like. Like a oversized stiff, no balanced hat. Not a good product."
3,Great introduction - terrible support,I fully agree with an earlier reviewer of this book. I am only through to chapter 6 after getting it last week and it is a great introduction. However all the examples do rely on the author's own Python user interface library which does not work.So don't expect to be able to run much of the sample code in this book. But it's a great read if you want to learn the theory behind game and simulation design with Python...
3,Stainless-Steel Lazy Susan,"This product serves the purpose for me, but I thought it might be a little more sturdy than what it was. It holds 8 bottles of coffee syrups with no problems thus far.I read the problems with the rubber mat, and agree; however, you can't see the mat if you have items covering it."
5,AWESOME BABY,These shorts are awesome...Fit like they are suppose to...wish they had more colors though
5,Eve and her band really rock!,"Go out and see Eve and the band...Their CDs are great, but livethey are even better. Eve and Mark have an uncommon knack for writing catchy tunes. The band is very cohesive and has evidently a lot of fun playing. Everyone whom we introduced to Eve's music has liked her."
3,A little disappointed,I got this for a 2 year old boy. I was disappointed to find that the images where just a bit of paper stuck to the whistle. This is NOT going to last in the hands of a rough and tumble toddler boy! It would be much better if the images where printed on to the actual wood.
4,Train whistle,"These train whistles have a very nice sound quality [multiple whistles]. My granddaughter and grandson were going to visit Thomas the Train, so these were a definite must. Of course, we left them at home rather than drive everyone on the train batty!"
2,HB-35 a lost cause?,"The HB-35 lens hood works fine except:1. The lens hood casts a shadow on the photograph when on the the Nikon 18-200mm lens and the lens is set at 18mm while using the onboard flash of either the Nikon D80 or D90. I have solved this by using the Nikon SB800 flash with the head tilted at 45 degrees and the built-in bounce card deployed.2. The HB-35 does not fit tightly on the Nikon 18-200mm lens. In 6 months, I have lost three lens hoods walking through fields and woods. The Nikon Service Department was unable to solve the problem even though the lens is under waranty. Does anyone have a suggestion?"
4,Better Quality than Nikon's,"I've been using this for about 5 months. The plastic's stronger than Nikon's hood, and it attaches easily; however, it can be easily dislodged, and if you're not careful, you'll be seeing hood shadows all of a sudden."
5,"Simple, flexible, affordable remote","After receiving this remote yesterday, I setup the home theater (amp,TV monitor,HD cable box,CD,DVD,DVR/VCR combo) and the bedroom (TV,DVD,VCR) in a couple of hours. The DVD and CD were easy to set up, since they were Sonys. One of the drawbacks is the lack of a code for common DVR/VCR combos, but I just used the learning function to copy the most important buttons for that, the amp, the TVs and the other VCR. I also used the learning function to customize/add a few other features. Now, unless I need some rarely used functionality, I can finally put away the other 6 remotes from the living room and the 3 from the bedroom. 5 stars."
4,Great remote,I was looking for a remote to control an Olevia 232V and Dish Network box. This one did the trick. Between the built in codes and the learning function this remote can pretty much do everything. I especially like being able to turn everything on and off with one button. Can't beat it for the price.
3,"For the price, not bad","The Sony RM-VL600 is attractively priced and works pretty well. The only real issue I've had with it is a lack of a pause feature (if it's there, I can't find reference to it)when executing a macro. The problem I had was when I programed one of the macro buttons to turn on the TV and then select the input for whatever function I was associating with that button (blu ray, for example)the TV wouldn't even turn on by the time the command was given for the input, thus making the process fail.I did figure out a two button work-around. I programed the ""A"" button just to turn on the TV, then programed the ""B"", ""C"" and ""D"" buttons to do the blu ray, cable box, etc. It works well."
1,SONY Remote needs improvement,This is a SONY Product and you cannot even program in the code for the SONY Blu-Ray Player. What good id this remote?
3,I'm a programmer and this thing was Difficult to program,"While programming all the devices was easy, doing some more advanced things was extremely difficult. I am a programmer and very handy with all electronics and this could not have been more annoyingly confusing.For example: it has a feature that when you switch to the DVD functionality it will turn on the amplifier and control the volume on the amplifier while you are in DVD mode. That was VERY difficult to setup.(I ended up replacing the cable remote with a newer one and that was really simple to program to do the exact same thing)So this remote ended up just laying around useless (well unless I loose the other one somewhere)It is also too wide to fit comfortably into my hand.However it does do what it is supposed, if you CAN figure it out."
1,Would not control Sony DVD,"The remote would not control my Sony BluRay player (BDP S350) which I bought a year ago. It did not respond to any of the codes supplied by Sony, and using the search function also did not work. It would operate my Sony TV and DirectTv, so I assume the control was working. Sony support ""chat"" was prompt, but they could provide no additional suggestions. What a waste of my time."
1,COMPLEX-CHEAP-POOR DESIGN,"This unit will cause you fits. It does not work on most of the codes given and will end up in a box in your garage. If you have a system with many different manufactures, get a Harmony - not this. It is glossy cheap plastic. Is this really the best Sony can do these days?"
1,Lousy,This thing is so hard to match up with my TV I finally gave up. I have here a worthless piece of junk.
4,Great Value,Excellent remote for the price. Nice large buttons and layout. Well made and good looking.
5,Does exactly what you would hope it would do.,"Works with all of my devices and most of the preset codes worked, making programing it fast and easy. For those it did not have presets for the learning function worked flawlessly. Not to mention it's the right price."
5,"Versatile remote, great value.",I have two of these and found them to be very functional and easy to use. They retail for $25 plus tax and I have paid $17-18 for them on amazon with free shipping. I am interested in the Harmony remotes but can't justify $100+ for a remote control?
2,Sony RM-VL600,"I have a Home Theater Master remote now, that is far better than the sony to use with my 4DTV and dish set up."
2,Possible Choking Hazard,"This is a really neat pacifier chain--great colors and shapes, holds our child's interest, makes the pacifier VERY hard to lose, and no worries about the product being made in China. That said, I am sad to report that after only five months of use, the yellow bead closest to the pacifier is splitting down the middle. Our child does put the chain in his mouth a lot, but he has no teeth, so my guess is that there's an issue with getting the beads wet (bad design flaw if that's the case) or we happened to get an item with a defective bead. In any case, I hesitate to recommend this item without reservation, and would suggest that if you DO order this item, keep an eye on it for splits in the beads."
2,A dissapointment,"I found this new effort from Hobb sadly disappointing and dull.I appreciate her efforts to explore a new setting, but what she does with that setting is ...not much. The central character fails to engage, and the novel moves at a snail's pace. I really found it hard to reconcile this plodding story with the verve that characterized Hobb's previous work.In the end, I had to force myself to finish Shaman's Crossing and could only consume it in tiny chunks to avoid giving up altogether. There may be the roots of a good story buried here, but unless the pace picks up considerably, it's hard to imagine this series ending up in the same lofty realm as the Liveship, Assasin and Tawny Man books."
4,A Great Beginning,"OK - so I finished it. I'm really still trying to form an opinion. I'm pretty sure I liked it but it sure is a mellow Hobbs. I think this is the ""build up"" or ""set up"" book and the next one (two) will strengthen the story. I didn't like the military twist but yet she made that interesting enough to keep me reading - it was not a turn off.I would say, don't skip it - it is going to turn into an excellent tale."
2,Stop now.... not a great series.,"Like many others, i went into this series on the heel of Hobb's OUTSTANDING past efforts. But this book was a chore to finish. Dry, boring, no real plot. None of the characters appealed to me, the story was vague and confusing. I won't be reading any further."
2,Down the road of Eddings,"I suppose it just goes to show that the well of creativity for some writers definitley runs dry. David Eddings had two excellent series with the Belgariad and Mallorean, and now writes totally unreadable [...].After reading Shaman's Crossing, I actually wondered if Robin Hobb even wrote this book. It is the polar opposite of the Royal Assassin trilogy. Dull, empty, retread characters in an even duller setting of thinly veiled political sentiment. What the hell happened to the quality? Maybe these authors have taken their profits, settled on a nice island, and hired ghost writers."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"To say this entire series doesn't even approch the quality of her earlier works is an understatement. Endlessly reinterates the same themes, unappealing characters and a barely considered plot which goes nowhere.Based on my enjoyment of her earlier works, including the Megan Lindholm books, I persevered, waiting for something to happen. It didn't."
1,Too idealistic as usual,"I can see the same flaws as the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies. Characters who are so innocent that they stink. Then a coming-of-age which is being portrayed as an exploitation of that innocence. Then add massive amounts of pathos, guilt, shame, idealism, self-pity.....On the whole, you would feel like banging your head against the wall and pulling out your hair when you read her books. Avoid at all cost if you want to remain at peace."
5,Addicted to jewelry; love this book,"I LOVE jewelry & easy little creative projects and I love this book. I wear the washer-earrings all the time & always get compliments on them! The designs are really good. These are 'urban chic' but have good, clean lines so they're elegant as well. People always ask me where I get these pieces - they're suprised to find out they can *make* them! I'd recommend this; it makes a good gift too."
1,Don't bother with this one,"I tried three books getting ready for the PMP.The Rita Mulcahy book was the best by a long shot. The ""Head First PMP"" was a distant second, but for a ""visual learner"" I found that I really remembered the financial sections form Head First over Rita Mulcahy.The Exam Cram tests were not even close to the PMP exam I took, and the book was poorly writting. A waste of money. You would be better surfing the net for PMP exam tips than reading this book.Or by Rita Mulcahy's books and pass the exam."
5,I love this book,"The drawings are very detailed which is great. I'm an artist myself, but still love to color, and this one is chock full of so much detail, plus the little factoids are a great addition. It's so great, I'll probably just make copies from it. :)"
4,Mezmerizing ...,"Emotional originals run the gammat with honest, sometimes stormy, vocals and mezmerizing piano accompaniment. Powerful lyrics in ""Rain"" and ""I Won't Cry."" Romance is found ""Wherever You Are."" ""In My Heart"" offers a sweet instrumental perfect for a wedding. And lovers get lost in the passionate offering of the cover song, ""Dancing with the Moon."" Incredible."
2,poorly balanced,"These tools, although fun looking, are poorly balanced and fall over if they don't have enough room to rest on the counter. The handles are a little awkward in size and the bowls of the spoons slightly too deep. I like their look, but I don't like the design of them."
2,These tools have several drawbacks,"Food (especially eggs) stick and even worse, these tools are handle heavy so they easily fall out of a skillet making a mess."
4,Very decent lantern. Charge could last a little longer,"This lantern is very handy. It is fairly bright and has a night light feature which is nice. When charging, it doesn't really tell you when the charge is full, however; so I'm not sure how long it takes to charge all the way up. A single nominal charge (of about 2 hours charge time) is worth about 45 minutes of light. So if you're camping, you'll need to have access to an outlet. Note that the lantern will not turn on when it is being charged (unless mine is defective). Overall, I prefer a propane lantern which is not much heavier and lasts days. However, the electric lanterns are safer, of course. If you must go with an electric lantern this one is a decent choice, but be sure to look around."
1,DISPOSABLE,Impossible to find the right replacement bulb! I've tried every avenue from Amazon to the chains and NO ONE carries this bulb.When the bulb burns out (and it will in no time) it's land fill material.Coleman is not what it once was. Last three items were garbage.
1,lantern,What a piece of junk bought this about little over a year ago kept the battery charged but when I needed it during a power outage it didn't work test the battery it was ok bought new bulbs still didn't work. next stop the trash can.
4,Good News!!!,"Good news for those searching for a replacement bulb!!! (Coleman part no. 5010000244) THEY ARE NOW IN STOCK!!! I just ordered two - shipping is a bit steep, but I ordered two for a total of just under $15.00... My lantern is nearing two years old now and has been very handy in numerous power outages in that time. (I've operated the power switch many dozens of times with no signs of wear - it's possible that early units had defective switches)... Still using the original bulb and rechargeable battery (which. surprisingly, shows little or no loss in capacity!) With availability of the bulb no longer a problem, I'd now give this product 4 1/2 stars (if I knew how!) power outage here after ""Hurricane"" Sandy, I'd take the lamp to work to recharge (along with my UPS units) and was able to extend its charge using the ups to charge it! Bought this one direct from Coleman - may buy a 2nd now from Amazon..."
1,Crap,Item does not hold charge - purchased 4 and they are all dodgey - all of them have only been chared once and dont work for longer than 5 minutes
3,"Great While It Worked, But Coleman Stood by It","This was a fantastic lantern while it worked! Two levels, one very bright, one softer to save battery power. Charged well and the battery lasted a long time for each use. One of our favorite features was the nightlight. However, first the nightlight stopped working - apparently the switch was defective - and soon the light wouldn't stay on at all, just flash as you turned the switch. HOWEVER, we contacted Coleman, and their customer service was AWESOME! Coleman no longer sells/supplies this lantern, but they are sending us a completely new replacement - the CPX(tm) 6 Rugged LED Lantern Realtree AP Camo - which gives us the ability to use either the rechargeable battery pack OR 4 D-cell batteries - a $70 value to replace the original $50 lantern. Might want to choose a different lantern than the Retro Rechargeable, but be confident buying a Coleman!"
5,The Enemy Mind,"This book is a page turner! The detail, description, and imagination of the author is awesome. I couldn't decide between thinking the main character was crazy, or cheering him on! Is someone really watching US??"
1,Sheer torture,"The fact that anyone would even admit to liking trash like this is astonishing (It's most likely the Rosie/Oprah crowd). Barbra Streisand is one of the most pompous, self-serving, over-rated artists of the last fifty years. Songs like ""People"" and ""Don't Rain on my Parade"" reek of more sappiness than a Hallmark convention. If I could give this no stars, I would. Simply pathetic!"
3,Great inexpensive set for little kids,"This is an OK set for the little kids to play with while you are playing with something a little nicer. Hey, they are going to bang it up anyway and they will still have a blast with this. Do yourself a favor and don't buy any set for adults that has handles less that 28 inches. Best adult playing length is usually 30 inches."
1,STETHOSCOPE,IT DOESN'T WORK. I COULD NOT HEAR MY HEART. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS MY AGE AND POOR HEARING BUT I HAD A FRIEND TRY AND HE ALSO COULD NOT HEAR HEART SOUNDS.
2,Bad product or bad hearing.,These seem to work for my wife but not for me. I'm almost seventy so it could be just my hearing. It's frustrating when we play doctor. The quality of the product looks good and the shipping was fast. I would give them to my friends for free.
5,Cheap,The item came quickly and performed fantastically for the low low price. I would recommend for entry level use or a second Steth
4,"Omron Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope, Black","Very good performance, easy to use, very versatile. I chose this product because of its good reviews, and recommend it to anyone needing a standard stethoscope for home use."
4,Stethoscope for general use,"This is a chinese made copy of a low tech. medical instrument. As a copy it is 20% of what I paid 30years ago for a similar stethoscope. I am not a cardiologist but,to me, as an otolaryngologist it appears to satisfactorily transmit and amplify pulmonary, cardiac, and bowel sounds for general evaluation of these organs. The tubing has taken on a mild twist from prolonged storage, the instrument doesn't hang straight from the user's neck but this is cosmetic and perhaps not all would display this mild problem. The tubing is soft and the workmanship is the equal of a similar stethoscope I purchased in the 1970's."
3,heart,thank you for the stethoscope i ordered. it was exactly what it said in the description. i tried it out and i worked very well. it also came on time and i was happy about that.
3,Omron Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope,The stethoscope is just ok. At least for me it's been hard to hear the systolic at times when doing blood pressures.
5,Wife's new tool,My wife uses this stethoscope to check for bowel sounds on her horse. She says it excellent and she loves that it is adjustable.
5,Quick shipping time and no problems.,This Stethoscope is excellent the price was fantastic it got here quickly and it's everything I expected and More. If you're looking for a dependable good quality Stethoscope this is the one for you.
3,The New American Album,"I personally think she has done better CDs than this. By the way, this is the 'Love At First Sight' American ALBUM, not a single.1. Love At First Sight +++++2. In Your Eyes(JJ Smoothie Mix) +++3. Baby +++++4. On A Night Like This(Motiv&Natural; Vocal Mix) +++5. Can't Get Blue Monday Out Of My Head +++++6. Your Disco Needs You(German Almighty Mix) +7.

4,Crazy Fun,"These books are like the Forth of July, hot with plenty of fireworks.In this third novel about the Steele Street boys, Ms. Janzen never lets the action slow. To the point where the whole book basically occurs during one day! It's a hard concept to pull off, and I would have liked to see Creed and Cody get a little more down time, in order to really develop the emotional aspects of their relationship. Creed had such potential to be a really tortured hero, but you just don't get enough of the emotional impact due to the timelines of the story.Fortunatly, this really didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book much, even if you do have to swallow a whole shaker of salt, not just a grain, to suspend your disbelif over some of the circumstances.And one more bonus, Skeeter and Dylan! Good pairing on the opposites-attract in the secondary budding romance.All in all, these books, just like your favorite summer block-buster movie, are fast-paced, action-packed,muscle car filled FUN!"
2,Terrible editing of paper version,I don't often buy ebooks so not sure how often this happens but there are pages that do not flow. It gets interrupted halfway through a paragraph for what I can only presume in the print version is Call out text or text in a box showing examples.However the editors here have obviously not read the entire thing from start to finish. Or it has not been proof read. Also there is one paragraph (page 65?) that makes NO SENSE whatsoever.I should have bought the print version.
2,"Not ""Gentle""","I was told that this was an alternative to the CIO method but it really isn't. You just stay in the room while they scream instead of leaving. It even suggests you keep a towel handy because your child may get so upset that he/she throws up, but if that happens you are still not supposed to pick them up. I don't consider that ""gentle""."
1,Returned in a hurry,"Other reviewers described this book as offering conflicting advise and I should have listened! One glance and I realized this offered no help whatsoever but took advantage of desperate, sleep-deprived parents and added to their confusion."
3,ehhhhhh,This book was recommended to me by a friend but a lot of what I read I already knew and feel I wasted my money reading my grandmother's spoken words. But.... if you don't have a mother or a grandmother or a bunch of friends with babies this would be a good book!
3,Talk to your mother/ friends for advice before buying this book,"This book may be helpful for some, but it wasn't for me and my son. I first started putting my son in his crib awake and he would fall asleep until about 8 weeks. (He has never slept through the night). Then we started letting him cry a bit--this did not work for me or him! By the time he fell asleep, he was exhausted and I was a nervous wreck and couldn't sleep myself. I believe he is not sleeping for more than 3 hours at a time because of our hospital experience--a three week stay with routine feedings and tests all day and all night long. I rock my son to sleep now and it only takes about 15 minutes and it is a wonderful experience! My mother didn't let me cry myself to sleep and some of my friends don't let there kids cry and eventually everything turned out fine!"
5,wise advice,My daughter found this book most helpful. She wished she had read it prior to her son's birth instead of after!
2,first movie is good but the second is a joke and the picture is garbage,"Loved the highlanders movies and tv show,ever since they came out.first movie was awsome but the second was such a waste and confussing movie that made no sense.but after watching the second highlander on bluray I saw they really changed alot in the movie so it made more sense.still isnt as good as the first tho. Now with the pictures on both I dunno what to even say.the grain in the picture is so bad at times.it. looks like im watchingbit on a old tv with a vhs tape.for such a game changer of a movie you would think that the transfer would of been alot better"
2,Disapointed viewer,"I've seen all of Tim Hartman's best works, Musty Muskies, Slippery Salmon, Trite Trout and Wacky Walleyes to name a few, and I must say this is his weakest film since Waterworld, in which he played Kevin Costner's mentor, a role often compared to Yoda in the Star Wars series. (Though I think we can all agree Yoda couldn't jig his way out of a wet paper bag) Frankly I'm shocked that Hartman would release a film with such low calibur acting. I mean the fish aren't even wearing makeup for many of the scenes, and you can see that the female bass in the fourth catch is very anorexic. I look to Hartman's producer Big Mouth Billy Bass ""the singing sensation"" to recruit some talent for his next work."
3,It works,Once ever 3 to 4 weeks I would have to clean the tip out cause the syrup would clog it. My old pumps never did this. Still it works.
2,leaked in shrinkwrap after less than one year,"These batteries ruined one of my good expensive LED flashlights. The flashlight was stored at room temperature and batteries were inserted less than a year ago. To my horror the unused batteries were also leaking inside the shrinkwrap in the box of ""new"" batteries. I don't see an expiration date. They are made in China. They seem like a good deal at first, but I won't be buying these again."
1,"Lacks a standard contact bump, will not fit in flashlight.","These AAAA Ultralast batteries do not have the little bump on the positive end as you would expect in a AA, AAA, or any other battery.The positive end is almost completely flat. Strangely, the negative end has a weird counter-sunk hole with a bump in it, but that bump does not extend past the end of the batter.As a result, the stack of 3 of these batteries is just over 1/8"" shorter than a stack of normal-looking Energizer AAAAs. The button on the flashlight does not go down far enough to connect, and it won't turn on."
3,Cheap Screws,"It looks great, but it's just a half inch too short for under my cabinet (easy fix with a $2 square dowel from Home Depot). Also, be sure to pre-drill your screw holes--the screws that come with the rack are decorative and I torqued the head off one.It fits 3 ordinary champagne flutes per slot. My beer goblet does not fit."
4,LET THE RAIN FALL DOWN,"Former Bad Moon Rising guitarist, Doug Aldrich unleashes his new band BURNING RAIN and their solid debut self-titled release. Classic hard rock sound with a bluesy flavor. Featuring rocking tracks like, ""Smooth Locomotion"", ""Jungle Queen"" and the melodic mid-tempo mover, ""Making My Heart Beat"". Doug Aldrich displays his energectic guitar style with lots of power and attitude. Proving why he is one of todays hottest guitar players! The band also features former MEDICINE WHEEL vocalist, Keith St. John and Aldrich's BMR bandmate, Ian Mayo on bass. Fans of hard rock music will definitely get their rocks off with this one. Just hit play and let the rocking begin!"
4,Dog collar,"Great product, but to bulky for my small dog.It's soft and durable. Good choice of colors.Better for larger dogs over 20 lbs.Shipped and arrived quickly."
3,Just okay,"I'm really not crazy about this collar but it works okay. I bought the apple green in a large for my 90lb Doberman and it is very loose on his neck. I had to slide the adjuster as far as it would go to make the collar smaller and it is still a bit too big, while the collar is now very thick and bunchy because it is doubled up nearly all the way around. I can't really speak to durability because its only purpose is to hold his tags and I attach a separate collar for walking etc. I plan to look for a different collar sometime, not in a huge rush but this one is not ideal and a little disappointing in terms of fit. It does feel nice and soft and I like that it is made from natural fibers. But the fit and bulkiness are not going to work for us. I grabbed him by the collar once and the whole thing slipped over his head. Would consider reordering in a medium but will probably just move on to something else."
3,Beware sizing misinformation,"This collar is sturdy and soft and would be great if it fit the dog. Amazon doesn't list the adjustable lengths for the medium collar and the Planet Dog site lists incorrect lengths. The label on the medium collar says that it's for neck sizes 12""-19"". Since this is too large for my dog, I'm having to pay shipping again to send it back."
3,Doesn't fit,"Doesn't fit our German Shepherd Dog. The harness wasn't even close either, so we're not really surprised, just mad that we had to drive all the way back to the store to return everything."
4,Comfy,This is a great collar for sensitive dogs- its inside is nice and soft and seems very comfortable. May not be the best option for pups who like to escape their collar but for my guy it's just perfect.
5,Soft :),Now that my elderly border collies activity level is low this collar is perfect for her to lay around in and not be able to feel it. It's very light and soft allowing her to still wear her tags giving me piece of mind. Very nice.
3,don't listen to the snobs,"this is a pretty good, feel-good dylan album. countryish and fun and you can go to the thift store right now and find it for a dollar in the record bins. one of the snobs on this discussion probably gave it away."
4,Great bag for travel,"I bought this bag to have something when I travel, but don't need a larger backpack. You can easily fit a wallet, some cosmetics, cell phone and a book or Kindle in the pack. It doesn't hold quite enough for me to use on a daily basis, unfortunately. I have the pewter color, and I like it quite a bit, both the fabric and the color. It also has slots for credit cards, but not enough to completely replace a wallet (or my wallet, in any case!)."
4,Great little backpack,"I saw someone on the street with this bag thought it was the perfect solution to my sore shoulder (from carrying a shoulder bag). The bag is lightweight and because it's pretty small, you don't end up carrying too much extra stuff around. That being said, my only complaint is that the inner compartments aren't very useful for me. Other than the cellphone pocket, the inside pocket isn't big enough for much, and there's no place for a pen (I don't need 2 lipstick holders). There are slots for cards, but I only put in ones that I hardly ever use. The strap converts from a single strap into double straps with a zipper, which is very clever. There's also a magnetic clip on top which holds it together in case you don't zip all the way. I got the leaf green which is bright and cheery."
4,"Great metaphysics primer, dispells misconceptions about meta","This is an excellent overview and primer on metaphysics. One of the main themes being the common thread of metaphysical truths (ancient wisdom) at the core of all world religions. Most people unfamiliar with this subject have many misconceptions about what metaphysics is. The author very clearly dispells these myths. The book is both informative and inspiring. This book will surprise the knowledgeable, the seeker and the skeptics."
5,Good Solid Hook,I have used three of these hooks in a cement wall at my office. Each hook went into the wall well. They did tend to take quite a bit of force. I ruined the first one because I did not hit it hard enough with the hammer but with the rest of them a bit of extra force popped them into the wall right quick. Once they were installed we hung a few framed pictures (about 2 lbs each) and they haven't moved at all for years even with people bumping into them from time to time.
2,worst audio treatment I have ever heard,"Normally, I would read this type of novel in book form. However, I was doing a fair amount of long commutes when the audio of Comes a Horseman caught my eye, so I thought I would give it a try. Looking back... I wish I'd read the book instead.I agree 100% with the previous reviewer... the reader was about as exciting as a sugar-free gelatin snack without the flavor and color.Pure monotone throughout... impossible to focus on the different characters... no change in vocal inflection to dramatize climactic events. The reader couldn't even read the punctuation properly... sentences running together... commas ignored... questions and exclamations read with no enthusiasm.I would give the book a try... but not the audio."
4,Horrific series of events,"Shocking true story that unsettled my mind but I couldnt look away from the barely plausible escalation of events. The true story of a fast food restaurant manager receiving a call from a man who . However, the shocking part was that each successive action seemed like it could actually happen. Then you step away and think how in the world did we get here, there's no way this could actually occur. This movie also opens your eyes to just how much trust we put in authority. This is a scary, twisted film but definitely worth watching."
3,Agonizing,"This movie is based on reality, so it's hard to imagine people doing the types of things they do, without any real understanding of the situation. It's incomprehensible...but the acting was pretty good, even if I kept wondering aloud how the characters had no common sense to think the situation through."
3,Okay,The ending left me hanging - I wanted to know more about what happened with these characters afterward. A bit voyeristic but hard to look away from.
1,awful,"Ridiculous story line and awful acting. After watching no more than 30 minutes, had to turn it off. Don't waste your time."
2,Long and Boring! Pass on this and save the money :(,"The previews made this movie look very inviting and interesting, but to the contrary very disappointing! Long draggy unrealistic though this is based on a true story."
1,Gullibility and Stupidity Taken to the Absurd Level,"There are plenty other reviews of this film that will provide the story line. I do not believe it is worth the time to repeat it as I do not think this film deserves a lengthy review. There may be people as gullible and stupid as the characters in this film, but to find so many in the same location is such a stretch that it makes the film annoyingly unbelievable. The total absence of common sense exhibited by the characters is so unlikely as to taint the message of the movie. It is a shame the filmmakers had to go so far with the circumstances as to render the film worthless and virtually unwatchable by a person of average intellect. This film should make you even angrier with its exaggerated voyeurism than your waste of time and effort in viewing it. A good bit less gullibility and stupidity by the characters may have made this an excellent film. I think they blew it."
1,Dont watch it.. dont pay for it.,"Horrible and stupid movie.Actors dont even know how to act. Saddly this movie is based on true events, but this movie is way to bad."
1,The dumbest movie I've seen in years.,"Based on a true story? So what? I'm sure there are a LOT of ""true stories"" that similarly aren't worthy of being turned into a feature length film. If you want to watch a film full of dumb people being dumb - watch Jackass.After watching the first 10 minutes, I fast forwarded through the rest. What a waste of time."
2,creppy sad and distasteful,this movie was sad and terribly graphic to be honest it sucked i didnt like it i can't believe this happened
3,Too much of the same,After the 1st 15 min. of Becky's shakedown & abuse. I think the point was made and the abuse became repetitive & predictable. I thought the story could have develop the characters more and the police investigation of this case( and the 70 similar cases mentioned) would have been more interesting.
4,compliance review,Suspenseful and amazing how men get away with this. I felt like I was in the middle of the situation. Made me feel tense and mad.
2,Beware of the smell!,"I didn't read carefully before ordering - with the cutesy name I assumed it was lamb jerky of some kind. They are actually dehydrated lamb lungs. My dog did not like them. They have quite an odor, which I also wasn't expecting. Some dogs might like them, especially large breeds. I won't order them again for my medium-sized Shiba Inu."
5,Your dog will love these.,I have 4 Chihuahuas and they go crazy for these things.They have a smell that dogs can't resist.They can easily be snapped into smaller bite sized pieces for smaller dogs.They are perfect for all Dogs. Three bags for less than $50 is a good deal compared to Petco.These cost almost $25 per bag in most pet stores.
2,not worth your time.,"not worth the time. its more of a polishing product. if you seriously want to remove scratches on your discs that make it unplayable, send it in to a professional scratch disc removal company, they only charge at most $3-$5 per a disc. they use the commercial machines to sand yoru disc to brand new.its alot better than buying a new dvd or game. just google ""disc scratch removal""."
3,Partially works,"It very depends on the deepness of the scratches, I would say only the very superficial scratches can be repaired by Skip Dr. and the superficial ones usually are not a problem for playback, unless you have really a lot of them. A typical medium deep scratch will not be worked out enough, even after 6 times cleaning. In battery mode its running a bit strange, slowing down during the process, I dont know if its needing so much battery power or what..."
5,Excellent product for home use!!! Very Satisfied,I had this DVD which was in a bad shape with scratches and would skip tracks all the time making it impossible to watch the movie. This product cleaned it up pretty good saving me some bucks. It paid for itself with the first few discs I cleaned. Definitely recommend it for all!Skip Dr. Motorized Automax Scratch Repair System
2,"Doesn't repair, just improves a little.....","I ordered this product because I'm stationed in Iraq and the sand is damaging the DVD's. Just minor scratches nothing big, this product kind of cleans them but it doesn't fix them by any means. It says it will fix minor scratches, they must mean, micro scratches, because the DVD's I was trying to improve weren't scratched that bad. It did work a little, run the DVD through it a few times and you can get close to what the product claims."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This Piece of Junk,"This type of device has not repaired a single disc ever in my experience. I wasted a whole lot of time (believe me, it is a long painstaking process) and money. I hope that others will learn from my mistake."
1,worthless,Do not buy this. I have tried to repair over 5 dvd's and it hasn't repaired a one. In fact two got worse! I followed directions perfectly. Save yourself the $.
3,Good,"The producted was packaged well, wasn't exactly what I wanted, received what I order and it was delivered on time as tracking information stated...The unit was difficult to use and didn't seem to remove scatchs as advertised."
1,You get what you pay for,I just received this item 1 hour ago cleaned 4 DVD`s they did clean up good. Put in the next DVD and the thing just sat there it locked up......... until smoke started rolling out of it!! Motor burnout with zero misuse!! Cheap plastic weak motor. Only Positive the seller had me return it but it may be months before I see a refund
2,Not a good product,"Bought this Repair System to fix my grandson's DVDs. He is Autistic and likes to handle his own DVD, so they got really dirty and scratched. When I tried to fix the DVDs, it either didn't fix them at all or completely messed them up. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Does not include power adaptor or batteries but...,"Just received this item - shipping speed was fine, arrived on time. Was a bit put off to find that it does not ship with a power adaptor, nor the 6 AA batteries that it takes to run it (there was no mention of a battery powered option). I didn't see this in the description or on anyone's reviews, so wanted to share this with you. Spending another $7.95 on an adaptor puts this unit at over $40 with S/H! Haven't used it yet (need to buy batteries, not waiting for adaptor) but I hope it runs well!After testing this product my skepticism has been replaced by conviction! It successfully cleaned a large stain on a DVD, and after a second cleaning enabled the disk to play successfully.Summary: does its job well; would be nice if it came with the adaptor. increase rating to 4.25 stars. :-)"
4,Great machine,"I've been really impressed with how easy it is to use, and how well it repairs the scratched discs. The only thing I wish it had was an AC power cord included, so I don't have to waste batteries on it."
1,ZERO STARS!,"Amazon why can't I put ZERO stars? This product is the worst thing I've bought on Amazon since I started using Amazon in 2002.I bought it to clean scratches on old computer games & CD's. This product didn't fix a single skip. The only thing it did was leave cool looking scratches on the CD. So I shelved it for a year or two. I busted it out again and tried to clean up some of my son's DVD movies and the MOTOR STARTED SMOKING! Are you serious right now? I don't know what kind of motor this thing has, but it's weak.Digital Innovations company has been added to my black list because of this product.Black List:DirectTVDIGITAL INNOVATIONS"
1,Skip this Dr.,First Use: completely removed the protective coating on the disk but did nothing for the scratch on either CD or 360 disk. Second Use: motor would not even complete a single rotation. Third Use: motor began smoking and would not turn disk.Summary: Negative net worth of whatever they sell it for (it does come with a bottle of tap water - that might be worth something)
4,disc repair system really works,"We bought this system after an expensive game disc my 12 year old daughterwas using developed a scratch. She used the system herself to repairthe disc which now works. Since then she has used the system to repairvarious scratched CDs which now play with no problem. As some of thesediscs are quite expensive to purchase, the system pays for itself."
1,Great product for easily destroying your CDs and DVDs,"We used this product some time ago, and it made deep buffing marks in our CDs. It was still playable, but with lots of new scratches. More recently we decided to give it another try with a Netflix movie that was skipping with a few minor visible scratches. We felt it was only honest to explain to Netflix that there are now deep patterned scratches all over the disk because we tried to use the Skip Dr. I don't often review products, but even products that don't work don't destroy your stuff, and the Skip Dr has destroyed everything we put in, even after carefully following directions/using ample solution etc. Really terrible product (we threw ours away)."
1,Not what I thought it would be!,"Skipdoctor CD Repair KitI purchase this as a Christmas gift for my sister. We both used it. The first cd we used came out with lines across the whole cd, due to sanding method. I thought it had ruined cd. Then I had to dry and buff myself, Very time consuming.It worked for 1 or 2 plays, then started skipping again.Also, being battery powered, I had to change the batteries three times in 1 month. Another big downfall were the sanding disks. They have to be manuevered into the machine to the point your actually bending them to fit,as they are very thin. Thus, the disks don't turn strait. It looks like a bent bicycle wheel.The sanding strips looks like they were glued on to the wheels, after only a few uses, the strips came off were they were glued,with excess flap hanging off, while it was turning. Making it impossible to use. I will be throwing it out,if you have alot of cds or dvds to repair, I don't think this product is your answer, I wouldn't recommed it!!"
3,it does the job,This product was ordered to fix a windows install disk and it did the job. There are still some deep scratches i do not think that they will come out.
1,mistake!!!,Skip Dr. Motorized AutoMax Scratch Repair System THIS ITEM IS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE. IT MADE THE DISC WORSE!
1,"RUINED, Not Repaired, My DVDs!","I followed the instructions exactly, but the Skip Dr. machine still managed to make my 2 barely-scratched DVDs even worse. I bought the ZDAG / Simo machine instead and it worked right from the first time... it repaired the DVDs that the Skip Dr. had made worse. I am so happy now. Thank you, Amazon, for offering the ZDAG machine and thank you to all the reviewers so far who have given the ZDAG machine all 5-star reviews!"
4,A cute and fun action figure,"This talking Sumomo action figure is a nice piece. A small switch on the bottom right side of her head allows you to switch from the default sample phrase, to OFF, or her full phrase menu. A button above the switch allows you to play the phrases. The cloth outfit is a very nice touch. While there are some articulation points (head, arms, and legs) posing is extremely limited, it would have been nice if she could sit, bend at the elbows and knees, or grip something like her tambourine (which is not provided). She is top heavy as all the electronics is in her head, so using the base stand is a must. Overall it's still a fun piece for anyone's collection."
3,ok,bought as a gift for my mother and she was so excited.. until she found out it didnt really do what she wanted. but i guess it is just steam and not magic ..so its understandable. just wish it would have cleaned more of the gunk off stuff. easy to use tho.
2,Not adequate for most home cleaning,"I bought this steamer at a local store, and returned it after trying once. It is small, well-built and convenient to carry around. However, I found it to be inadequate for most household cleaning jobs. The heat was not enough and the pressure was not enough for cleaning bathrooms and kitchens. We are just 2 adults in our home and the house is fairly clean. Yet this tool doesn't have enough power to scrub and clean tiles or greasy spots that arise from everyday use.I ended up buying a canister steamer (1500 Watts) for around 100 dollars, and that works for us. I'm waiting for a powerful hand held steamer."
3,Euro Pro Shark Steamer,"This product seemed to be broken the second time I used it, but it started working again. The steam is powerful and it gets the job done. I probably need a little more time to decide if it will continue to work."
2,works good enough but,Mine worked good enough for window cleaning until it stopped making steam after first on-and-off 30 min use.
4,Euro-pro Shark Super Steamer,"Love this product so much I purchased Qty. (2)! Easy to use. Fast heating. Light and powerful. Use it in bathroom, kitchen, car, window sills, baseboards, etc. Just what I was looking for and could not find in retail stores. Planning to purchase another for upstairs. Love cleaning without chemicals!!"
3,I am keeping my fingers crossed so far....,"I am happy so far with this product. However a word of warning. Euro-pro covers this product with a 1 year limited warranty. Limited means you are responsible to pay for all shipping costs as well as labor costs for them to fix the merchandise. It is a terrible deal in that aspect. I am happy with this machines performance thus far. It is a complimentary addition to your cleaning tools. It will help replace the need for chemical cleaners in many situations. However it is not the answer to all your cleaning dilemmas. It has a decent array of attachments that come with it, and has so far already out survived my steam mop purchased at the same time from the same company. As I stated earlier the warranty stinks, so if you want to take a gamble then it may pay off."
5,Batman as a Warlord in fuedal Japan! Maybe.,"Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty, is the story of Batman as a samurai warlord set in feudal Japan which may sound completely nonsensical at first, but once you realize that it is an Elseworlds title, it all falls into place. This is an excellent story which pushes the boundaries of the comics art form and virtually redefines batman as we know him. Buy this and you won't be dissapointed. Peace."
3,Entertaining Elseworld Tale,This was a pretty good Elseworlds title going through three different Waynes lifes. And thier struggles with a certain Immortal.The first tale is from the Crusades and stars Joshua Wainwright.The Second Tale is of Bruce Wayne.The Final tale is of Brenna Wayne.The stories are pretty good and I'd pick the first as the best. The art is really good in this book and just overall an entertaining story.
1,More junk,"This item was broken in the packaging. When I went to exchange it, every other one of the Crystal Art items was ALSO broken in the packaging.Thanks again Rose Art for making more garbage."
3,Wish I could give them 5 stars!,"Like the title says I wish I could give them a 5. To begin with I wear a 13ee and have for as long as I can remember. What I do like: UNION MADE IN THE USA, 5 stars for that. Comfortable out of the box and they required minimal breaking in. The downside is that they do run long but not so much as to be a deal breaker, however they do run narrow and I had to return the ee for a eee which I have never worn before. The most annoying thing is that they SQUEEK...and it is making me crazy! I guess I will squeek along until they wear out and then try a different brand."
1,los cheapos,substandard poor quality not even useable. I have to return this and it says I cant because I opened the package the shirt was in. Well how would I know that the shirt is paper thin and doesn't fit without wearing it? This was a ripoff. Every other thing I have got through amazon has been great.
5,Great,"won' buy ffrom dept stores again. my husband wears these year round and it is hard to find them in the winter. came individually packaged and fit perfectly, nice colors."
2,Disappointed,I've been wearing Russell T-shirts & tank tops for 25 years. I still have a few from the first batch. Russell always put out a quality product.The current tank tops are disappointing. The material is very thin and the stitching at the seams is not the reinforced double stitching that they used on earlier tank tops. The pricing is a little cheaper but the savings wont offset the quality of the shirt. I would have paid more for a better product.
2,In a word: Chincy,"Yeah Just got these and tried these on. It is like every clothing manufacturer is trying to experiment with how thin they can make the material so that they can maximize profits and make you have to buy more when these tear or go bad.Whatever Amazon prime 12 bucks two shirts delivered free in 2 days.. The shirts arent soft. The material is thin.. not the WORST I have seen but really really close to being what I would term ""Bad"" Ehh..."
4,Good value,These tank tops are ideal for a good workout. They are neat and seem well made. The material is a bit thin but not a deal breaker.
2,There are better ones,"I needed a cheap tank so that's what I was on the hunt for and that's why I bought this. I guess I got a cheap tank. Sizes run slightly small but my biggest issue is how short they are. These just need to be 3-4"" longer. I would order up a size were I to order again, though I probably will not be ordering again."
4,Swings are very convenient.,Once your little one gets in this swing they will slowly drift off and give you some free time.
3,Looks good but looks can be decieving!!!,"I bought this swing for my 3 week old daughter. I liked the bright color and it matched the bouncy seat I had been given at my baby shower. I also liked the features of the swing. The box said it had 6 different speeds,side to side or front to back motion,a motorized mobile,and played different songs. When we got it home I was very unhappy with the swing. First of all it was to fast, even on the slowest setting. When we put the music on we could barely hear it with the volume all the way up and the mobile was just a few toys going round and round. The swing does not have much stimulation to keep babies happy. My daughter would not sit it in the swing, she would start crying when I put her it in. I returned the swing and bought the Fisher price aquarium take along swing which my daughter loves. I would not reccomend this swing to anyone."
2,Where is the bird?,The old model had a cute bird flapping it's wings and bobbing it's head.This one does not. In my opinion Its not as nice.
5,HER BEST CD TO DATE,"When I first herad ""Every time da beat drop"" I knew that her CD was going to be good. I was so upset when they pushed the date back. Originally it was supposed to come out in Sept. But I am very satisfied. I love tracks 1,2,4,5,7 and 10 is my all time favorite. Those songs are very deep, and when listened too (ladies) Im sure that you'll be able to relate on so many levels. Brian Micheal Cox, Jermaine Dupri, Swizz Beats, and Missy put it down. Again, she deserves 5 stars. HER CD IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,AN EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT,"This was a waste of money and time. I am a PGA Professional, and I don't have a clue as to why Andrisani (very well respected) wrote what he wrote. Tiger's swing is FLATTER and more ROUNDED now, NOT upright. Tiger credits Haney with helping him develop a better DRAW, not fade. He could not get the ball to turn over with the old swing (also a reason why he went through so many drivers a couple of years ago). In addition, Haney is the one who told him to make his backswing LONGER, not shorter, and also told him that it was ok to have extremely fast hips; in fact, he said to just let the hips go naturally.I also was not interested in hearing about Andrisani's criticism's of other instructors' teaching methods. Some of what he criticized are actually valuable teaching mantras from the likes of Jim Hardy (""The Plane Truth""), which coincidentally, is another book cowritten by Andrisani. He sounded more bitter at times, than objective."
2,???,"I agree with another reviewer here, Tiger flatten his swing. I don't know why Mr. Andrisani think Tiger changed his swing to more upright. Anyone who compares Tiger's 2000 swing and his swing now would see that Tiger's swing has flatten out.Yes, I do agree with Mr. Andrisani and think that Tiger has a fuller swing now than his old swing, which is more of a three quarter swing. But it is obvious that Tiger changed his swing plane from upright to a more flat swing plane and the fact that Mr. Andrisani thinks the opposite really baffled me."
4,Awesome Music,"All you have to do is take one listen to ""Under You."" It will get you hooked to their music. Very catchy lyrics and the beat to each song is amazing. Definitely recommend this cd to anyone who likes music period."
1,Not Worth Wasting Your Money,I spent a lot of money on this CD cause I thought there would be great remixes on it however there is just one remix (Amber Remix) and even this sounds very similar to the Kaygee mix. All the other remixes are on her album so I strongly suggest you just get her album and forget about this single.
2,Stiff and labored,"This series has received so much hype (not just here but everywhere). None of AF's shortcomings have been mentioned yet: the stiff fingerwork, the tempo rushes, the missed chords, the lack of real dynamics. She sounds stiff and tense, and that's how these recordings come off. As for ""insights,"" I don't hear anything markedly different from her peers. Things aren't helped by the clunky sound and the too-close miking. (I know we won't get the rolled sound of a Steinway from a Bosendorfer, but these recordings, all of them, still sound claustrophobic). Volume eight comes off the best overall, but in the competition of Arrau, Schnabel, Levy (who didn't record anywhere near all of them, but who should be sought out nonetheless), Richter (ditto), Kovacevich, et al, these are lightweight. (Interestingly, she does a very fine Op. 109 on a BBC Legends disc that's probably out of print now, accompanied by a ""Pastorale"" sonata and a mixed-bag Op. 111. If you see that, you should grab it.)"
5,Like visiting old friends,I loved the way Karen White wrote about our old friends but as supporting characters with a new main character to focus on. Well written and a very enjoyable read.
5,"don't think 'W' would be a fan, but i am","Boy Sets Fire has a different style, its not hardcore, emo, punk, rock, but meticulously fuses all of them to create something much more. Very political, these guys have no qualms in voicing their opinions which they do every chance they get. They show their disaprovement with corporate america as well as those currently in power through their powerful lyrics.While this may throw some people off, these political messages certainly do not take away from the amazing listenability. After the Eulogy was just a great record among an amazing collection they've put together. I recommend this to anyone with an open mind and an ear for great music.It would be great if those reading this would pick up a cd rather than burn it, I mean these guys formed the band in my hometown and they like all other non-mainstream bands could use the money unlike the metallicas and dr dre's who whine about music piracy."
1,"This is a major rip off, do not waste your money or time.","This is a shameless rip off. The only reference to Pokemon is how he too collects the Wisard cards and toys and is familiar with the TV show. He tell you to download images off the web or scan them in. All that is offered is rules to play a card game. The disket contains templates that are only squares or ovals evenly spaced. Any one can do that on Power Point or any other Program. There are no images, only pages stapled together. The disk is a floppy."
1,Nothing that I expected,The description says that it is 15X33. This is not true. When I measured it was 11X24. The picture and description doesn't say anything about the underneath being white instead of red. The fitted sheet was so poorly sewn that the first time washing it I'm sure it would have fallen apart. The fabric was see through. The return process was horrible and I was out restocking fees and shipping costs. Had it been properly represented I would not have ordered it.
5,As good as they get!,"This movie, featuring Vincent Price and Betty Davis, finds them both in one of the best performances of either's careers. This gentle story, about the relationships between friends and family in the winter of life gets 5 out of 5 stars."
3,Questionable reviews,"The two other reviews seem questionable. They read like an add for the book.Honestly, the book has nice illustrations. It is short on design princples, and long on examples. Check out Robin Williams Non-Designer's book as well."
3,"Still heavy, but moving away from doom","Left Hand Solution's third release, Light Shines Black, begins a departure from the classic doom sound of their first two releases, Shadowdance and Fevered, both of which were more akin to, say, Solitude Aeturnus with a female vocalist. Light Shines Black, however, has a more accessible feel to it. Make no mistake, this isn't rock-n-roll. The guitars are still downtuned and ultra-heavy, but the riffing is more upbeat and catchy, comparable on both counts to Ethereal Mirror-era Cathedral, moreso than the early LHP material. Add some Mandylion-era The Gathering to that Cathedral influence and you have a fairly good grasp of what LHP was after with Light Shines Black. With the exception of an unfortunate and inexplicable Eurythimics cover, the rest of the songs on this disc will have you either tapping your feet or banging your head with glee."
3,Please remaster,"By this time in Dylan's career, he ahd already changed too an electric sound. The sound in this album is a tiny bit more experimental but still very easy to the ears. The first 3/4 songs are pretty good stuff but it seems to kind of drop down in quality towards the end and everything starts to sound the same. I would still definitely recommend this album, but beware that this album has no top charters-though still a very well written album . Once this album gets remastered it should deserve another star, but you have to turn it way up to be able to hear it completely.;"
4,"Excellent Record, Very Pleased","I absolutely love Dylan's new style in this record. It has great moments, and in my opinion is a very easy record to listen to. I feel this album is underrated and is better than people claim. It's full of gospel, country, folk, you name it. And just like most Dylan records, you need to be in the right setting or mood. I mean it's kind of hard to go from listening to Freewheelin' Dylan to Modern Times. I highly recommend this album to anybody, it's almost a masterpiece."
3,a christian dylan,"well,as the story goes,bob dylan was all fubar'd and got into a motorcycle accident.when he was being hurled through the air,the last thing he saw was a neon sign that read ""jesus saves"".he decided to throw together this album dedicated,mostly,to the christian god.theres 2 songs i play a lot on this one.......""if not for you""-a cool love song where he rhymes words multiple times at an alarming rate.its so cool.the other is ""winterlude"",a sort of old timey,reminiscant,secret love song.the rest of the album is not bad those are just the 2 i always end up playing.it was the first bob dylan album that got less than 4 stars from me."
4,Brilliantly melodic and evocative,"Dylan does well here to move the listener to another place. Like Van Morrison, but more realistically, he employs the pastoral but keeps us grounded in reality. All the songs here are smooth and unfolding. From the smooth introduction to Went to See the Gypsy to the quick and furtive Father of Night, Dylan has a well crafted, tight fitting masterpiece that makes this a really fun album to listen to. The edges aren't rough and the sound is warm as he tones his voice down. His vocals, as in Nashville Skyline, seem more mature which lends the album a laid back feeling. This is absolutely one of my favorite Dylan albums and a must have!"
5,Belle Prater's Boy/,"Ruth White is a great author of Belle Praters Boy.There are some good characters in this story. The characters in the story are Woodrow, Gypsy, and Mrs. Cooper, Amos Leemaster.White also wrote many other books. I think Belle Prater's Boy is her best. Woodrow has an eye problem like my friend Kim had. This was a really good book. I hah fun read this book.(...)"
1,Logically unsound,"ok i got this book as a gift and the puzzle is fun when it makes sense. there however are several misprints in this book. it starts with the second and third puzzle having more than one solution. so i decided that the easy ones were just well easy. i decided to jump to the very last puzzle in the beginner section. after a very short time i came upon my next misprint. the second 3x3 square has the #4 printed twice. this is an impossible puzzle. the solution shows that one of the 4's should be a 6 if they botched the easy ones, i can only assume that some of the most difficult puzzles would have no solution either. i'd give the editor of this one a 60% because thats about as good as the puzzles are. its a good book to start out with because there are so many easy ones along with a good instruction on the basics of the game. dont pay over a dollar"
3,Makes cleaning fun,I have the scum buster & it helps cleaning the bathroom but the battery & charger do no have a long life. I've had my unit for about one year and the charger no longer works. Checked on the cost of replacment & it was double what the unit costs. Not to cost effective
4,Such a good thing!,"Don't let the title fool you, this is not a release of new 2002 mixes, rather a re-release of the out of print (in the UK) CD single with a brand new b-side. Tracks 1 & 3 are from the original single release back in 1991.Track 2, ""Such a Good Thing,"" is a brand spanking new track that the BBC used during World Cup 2002 coverage. IMO, the new track is fabulous. Upon first listen, it was OK, but like most great New Order tracks it gets better and better every time I hear it. It's vintage New Order, kind of Brotherhood vs. Technique, and IMO worth the cost of this CD by itself."
4,Unusual approach to bargello,"Please see the images I uploaded above. The author's take on bargello is more kaleidoscopic than most. These designs are very fresh but unlike other books, there's not even a suggestion how to use them except as pictures or pillows. However, they are dazzling. I recommend the book just to expand your horizons."
3,You could do better,"This book is well-written and has a lot of pertinent information inside, but I feel like I wasted my money buying this book. I have never really used it when preparing for the exam; instead, I have been using my undergraduate textbooks which are far more uselful in preparing for the exam. So only buy this book if you have sold back your undergrad books or if they were horribly written."
1,Poor recording quality,"The performance is fine, but the recording quality is poor. There seems to be someone's muffled voice surfacing often in the background audio. Best to avoid this particular recording."
3,Worth it for this price,"Although the main glass jar is too heavy, but overall it is a very good product. A product worth for its price."
3,"For its time a decent album, but better things were coming","From the funky cover shot of Barbra in a pickup to the (then)up to date collection of lite-rock songs, Streisand seemed anxious--and maybe even a little insecure--about moving into a new decade as her own woman and not just another contract-singer for Columbia. Indeed, the opener(Joni Mitchell's ""I Don't Know Where I Stand"")is a deep, tender ode to uncertain love, and Gordon Lightfoot's ""If You Could Read My Mind"" suits Barbra well. Not all of the material measures up to Streisand however, and stuff like ""Flim Flam Man"" and ""No Easy Way Down"" is just forgettable. Better things were coming, as evidenced on Streisand's more rocking follow-up disc ""Barbra Joan"". That's a better place to begin when examing this decade of the superstar's fascinating career."
1,Poor copy of real music,"As in the awful ""BJS"" album, the singer tries to find out what all the fuss is about in the youth market. The result sounds like a parody album. On some tracks, it sounds like a bad Karaoke performance.In particular, ""Free the People"" is painful, especially when compared with the Delaney and Bonnie original. Bonnie Bramlett, as idiosyncratic a singer as she is, still shows much better range than the famous Barbara.Likewise, the Randy Newman covers are vapidly done, with none of the menace or energy that Randy brings to his songs.This album is basically a form of Muzak. Live high energy music filtered and sanitized for the housefrau set.Barbra sounds much better when she sticks to corn and schmaltz.Fer cryin out loud, this piece of crap was in stores RIGHT NEXT TO THE ORIGINALS!Do yourself a favor and listen to the originals. If you can stand her versions, you might find something new to enjoy as well!"
2,Not worth the price,These fell apart with a few months. The stitching on the rubber on the toe came apart. Merrell is going down hill on quality
4,Great Performances!,"This DVD captures Campbell at what was probably the peak of his career. His voice is exceptional and his stage presence is right on. There are a number of his greatest hits included as well as some seldom heard additions. I liked the modified version of ""Galveston"" and his performance of ""Mary in The Morning"". The section pairing Campbell with songwriter Jimmy Webb is a treat. The two talents were a great combination. Campbell's rendition of MacArthur Park is one of my favorites.The DVD quality does leave much to be desired. The video is VHS quality and the sound is a little scratchy at times. However, for the price and the number of performances included I suppose these limitation should be overlooked.I believe this would be a loved addition to any Glen Campbell Fan's collection."
5,Travel Tea Mug Mesh Tea Strainer,"Item was received as described, in speedy time--given as gifts, the receivers said it was better than the $30 one they saw in a tea store. They liked the idea the infuser was mesh and removable."
5,"Amazing, especially for the $","This guitar is incredible, espec for the price. Being an on again/ off again player, this instrument has renewed my interest in playing again for the following reasons:1. Excellent workmanship. Hard to believe it is made in Mexico. Not that that is inherently bad, but aren't the American ones supposed to be better?2. The neck is elegantly playable.3. The sound is everything I could want.4. Versatility is the main thing. If you want a Santana sustain and warmth. It's got it. If you want a sweet jazz hollowbody sound, it's got it too.At this point I would take this guitar to the desert island over my PRS and all of the other expensive axes I own.Enjoy!"
2,Lazy Effort,"Don't get me wrong. I love TLC, they were especially cool back in the day, their clothes were tight, and their music was tighter! But I'll be honest about the quality of this particular video. The makers of the video obviously weren't thinking of the customers this time, were they? There wasn't much of anything included, just a few short interviews and an incomplete video collection ""Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg"", ""Baby-Baby-Baby"", and ""What About Your Friends"". They totally forgot ""Hat 2 Da Back"" and ""Sleigh Ride."" If I can't find these videos on this release, where CAN I find them? For real quality, buy CrazyVideoCool."
4,Very nice album from SV,This album is better then there new album. I really don't think this is a official album but it is very good and is one of the Top 20 for the entire year as far as I see. The Lyrics could have been a little better but the beats and replay is very good.
3,Just OK,"Is it really possible to mispronounce ""mia"" and ""mio""? In Non ti scordar' di me this singer accomplishes exactly that.Then there are wrong words: I think he means sempre and not sempro.The production values are fine, so if you put this on for background music and don't really listen to it, it's just OK."
5,the oc is the best show!,as many people found this season boring...i could say it was less rated than season 1 and 2...but this season isnt left out of drama!!! the kaitlin come back was genious! marissa kicked out of school too! volchok and marissa too! and marissa's death...as much as this season was a bit centered on marissa it was a good season..at the biggining i thought the season 3 episodes were getting exhausted...but then the finale changed everything! the Graduates was such a good episode...for Season 4 Marissa is dead...but Josh Schwartz will come back to write Season 4 and turn it to its old ways..so as i say i would think its a worth purchase object! for any oc fans!...if you are new to the show...start on season 1!
2,The worst season of the series,"Well, this is by far the worst season of the series and possibly the reason why the show lost so much of its fans. They try to reuse ideas that worked for season 1 and the second time around it seems old and boring. Personally, the character of marissa becomes extremely annoying and the series arc is dissapointing. But if you're an OC fan like me you'll probably still end up buying this season"
5,Excellent service!,I could not have been happier with the dvd season that I ordered from them. It arrived earlier than was anticipated. I would definitely order from them again!
2,Disappointing,"I loved and still love the o.c. but the third season was disappointing. very. first season was hands down the best. second season was almost as good as first but this third season is just full of crap. it's fine that they made it more dramatic, but it just didn't fit the o.c. concept of the tv show. they changed up way too much things in one season. ridiculous that marissa is never coming back, the MAIN CHARACTER! and this season had way too many antagonists. way way way too many. far from fun and exciting seasons 1 and 2, just a disappointing drama filled season set out for higher ratings but they fell and failed hard and their ratings declined like crazy back then when it was on air. if you have seasons 1 and 2 dvd set, of course you'll need this in your collection but be aware it will be disappointing to all the the o.c. fans out there."
2,"Nice enough designs, BUT......","Since there is no book description to-date, I guess I'll be the one to tell you: This book is a companion to the template set by the same name. The template set is NOT included but can be ordered (from the author) for $60, plus another $20 if you want a holder for them. The book relies on your buying the templates. It gives tracings of each in the back, so you could make your own, but as most quilters know, there is a big difference between homemade sheet-plastic templates and laser-cut plexi-templates, both in accuracy and safety. Just be aware: an additional purchase is almost certainly required with this book!! I wish they'd said that up front, and I'd have passed on this one."
5,Leggo my Legos!,"My son was brought up on Legos, and by the time he was off to college, thousands of the tiny colorful blocks were packed up to fill a closet to the brim. With the arrival of my first grandchild, now a very busy 15-month-old, I couldn't wait to get her started on a toy that still captures the fancy of her father. I'm happy to report that whether it is as a result of genetics or just plain good sense, my darling granddaughter knows good things when she sees, feels, and occasionally bites them. These large, colorful Legos keep her dextrous fingers working and her attention span increasing. And then there's always the fun of aiming them at their storage Bee container. One down side: Lucy the cat, who also favors the toy, has provided a premature and unwanted lesson in sharing!"
2,Package in good shape but two of them came broken.,"Two of the items came broke, Ralf Malf s foot was broken off. Richie's arm was broken. Could not tell broken until my Grandson opened the package."
4,Indispensable,"I found the book somewhat dry, and surprisingly unpassionate, given its subject matter, but neverthless a good handbook as far as a grasp of the main issues of Irish history are concerned. In an academic setting, nevertheless, I thought it indispensable."
5,worth every cent!,"This book is easy to read, easy to navigate and has great illustrations. Worth the price and an asset to any designers collection."
4,It makes sense!,"Of course! It makes complete sense. These activities have woken up the minds of the people I work with who can no longer keep up with ""regular"" programing. It is success every time. I love it, a great book for anyone who work with dementia of any type!"
5,Really helpbul book,"This is a book that actually does what the cover says it does. I found the directions clear and complete, and I especially appreciate the inclusive index. A nice surprise was the selection of coupons in the back for discounts and free photo prints which I had not anticipated."
2,terribly hard to fit,"these suck, and not in the good way, terribly hard to fit. and the ""amazing"" thermoplastic hardens so fast you cant adjust it at all..I do not recommend these to anyone, waster of 20 bucks and ruined my halloween"
2,not so smooth,"I'm not sure if other pen fans out there have noticed this or not, but every Sensa ballpoint pen I own (and sadly I own more than one) has the same incredibly annoying problem. The ink flow is splotchy. Whenever I write there are consistent breaks in the lines. Undoubtedly this is a problem with the ""space age"" refill, but I find it pretty intolerable. What good is a pen that is comfortable and writes under water when it doesn't write as smoothly as a Bic under normal circumstances?"
3,BORING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Almost 300 pages of nothing - including several pages wasted on the camparison of Nixon to Lana Turner (I still cannot make the connection). Morrow rambles on endlessly about minor details of the 3 main characters lives - and most of it is BS. This book was horrible - no wonder why it was in the discount section of the bookstore. What a waste !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Basic 101 of Three Politicians,"Wow! I really expected more out of this book. Anyone who knows the slightest thing about the three men already knew the facts that were published here. I expected the stories to be interwoven in an interesting manner or at least some new information presented to us. In this book, you get neither. Save some time and get three different books about these presidents and their fascinating rises to the top spot in U.S. politics."
5,Simply Stunning,"In the last year or so, I've become immersed in the Monterey Pop Festival and the blues from this time. I picked up Pearl because I love Janis and she's always been a genius figure in music. However, this album is one of the first albums to actually give me goosebumps. Listening to her voice, I saw so much versatility. She could get raspy and passionate in some of the tracks, while she could also tone it down and display her magnetic voice. Her backup band, which she helped choose, is a fantastic partnership to Janis.Get this album. Whether you get this version or the version with a whole disc of live cuts, please get this album. The additional liner notes comment on this being her most mature and polished work, and that couldn't be more right. Pay tribute to one of the greatest, most classic blues singers and buy this album."
2,Disappointed,"Amazon advertised this cd with 14 tracks. The cd I received only had 10. I chose it because it had the extra tracks. Will not return because it was so cheap, but very disappointed with Amazon."
2,Very disappointed.,"I grew up listening to her ""In Concert"" album, and bought the Pearl album based on reviews saying this was a more mature style for her music. I like her old style better, this sounds like she was trying to make a more pop sound for her music (although the singing wasn't much different). It not only didn't sound like what you expect from Janice Joplin, it sounded like a muzak imitation of her."
4,Great resource in Spanish or English.,"I have the English version and use it often with students having communication difficulties. I recommend it to teachers, parents and anyone needing information on autism and communication impairments."
3,Will there be a new edition?,Got this book for a friend in China. He runs a golf tourism company and thinks this should be on coffee tables of any true golf lover. I just wish there is a newer edition that covers to the very end of 20th century.
4,Love Thomas,Good movie-we all love Thomas! Have never been disappointed with a Thomas Movie. Love the ones where his mouth moves most!
1,"Blatantly avoids the word, ""Christmas""","I am not much of a religious person, but I was very much annoyed and turned off by the blatant attempts to avoid mention of the word, ""Christmas,"" in the title and throughout the video features. Come on! Christmas may be a Christian holiday, but it is now being enjoyed by people of many different religious background; to avoid mentioning ""Christmas""-- I assume so that non-Christians viewers and would-be viewers wouldn't be turned off or somehow offended--is rather ridiculous. ""Merry Winter Holidays?"" God, what a bunch of hipocrites!!!! The original Thomas character was created by a Christian clergyman, for GOD'S SAKE!!! If HIT entertainment keeps this up, I'll have to cut out Thomas from my two son's library just like I've cut off Barney from our household for being so annoying."
3,"Decent, but...","My boys love this video (they are 4 and 2), and they know it's about Christmas, but I've make sure to explain that some people think saying ""Merry Christmas"" is offensive, which is why they're saying weird things. I noticed that they didn't rename the Christmas Tree, but they avoided actually identifying ""Father Christmas"" (the costume Mr. Perkins wears at the end of the program), because ""Father Winter Holiday"" would sound just ""too"" ridiculous. So, as an adult, I find the show annoyingly anti-Christian (can you imagine renaming Muslim or Jewish holidays to avoid offending non-Muslims or non-Jews?), but otherwise my boys love watching the program."
1,Completely Worthless for a guitar player,"This book is completely worthless if you want to learn how to play (the guitar) on these songs. It's got some nice pictures and interviews, but that's about it. I wasted my money on this one."
5,Kitchen Selectives SM-500 Professional Stainless Steel Immersion Blender,"Love it, love it, love it! It does everything I wanted and more. Great at chopping! Good at blending, haven't tried ice crusher yet. You don't need a blender with this handy tool around."
2,Used to love it until the tent poles snapped,"First, the positives:The size is great! You can stand up in the tent. I am able to lay my air mattress down on one side, and place my suitcases on the other side, and still have walking room. The windows provide ample fresh air. It is easy for two people to put together.Now, the reason for the low rating:I have used this tent for three years. The last time I went camping, two of my tent poles snapped as I was taking them down. I have attempted to buy new poles from the company, and Coleman has stopped making replacement poles. They gave me a special number to call a place that specializes in making custom poles. I called there to find out that it would cost about $45 to replace 2 poles! I only paid $100 for the tent!! I have decided to purchase a new tent, since the replacement poles are half the cost of my tent...and I am skeptical as to how long the remaining poles will last!"
2,common sense,I bought this book after accepting a position where I would be working with teenagers. I didn't read anything I didn't already know from common sense. Very general and remedial.
2,"Redunkulous album, awful remaster.","The item itself deserves no stars, but the album deserves all of them--I compromised. Such a great album with such a crap reproduction of the actual sounds made in the studio. Unless you just want to hear the songs or you don't have a very discerning ear, don't waste your money on this tinny ish. Either get a record player, or buy the UK import CD with the original flag album cover. Much better remaster there... though I urge you to go analogue."
5,far to Underrated,"this Band should be far more known.everybody knows ""Time Has Come today"" but this Band was far more than a Commerical or Catch Phrase Group.they Blended Many Styles&were right there with Sly&The Family Stone,Jimi Hendrix,etc... at Fusion&Adding many styles into there work.History hasn't done this Band Justice at all they have Meant to Music as we know it.check this Out&Hear Music without a Label."
4,Fun fighting game,I played this game way back in the day. It's still as fun now as it was then. Definitely a good buy for the money.
1,piece of junk,"First of all, this game does not recognize my memory stick even though all of my other games do. Thus, I can not save anything and have to change the settings every time I want to play the game. The graphics are not good at all. Just not fun to play, would give it 0 or negative star rating if I could."
4,very satisfied,The belt buckle was just what I thought it would be. I purchased it as a gift. the reciepent was happy with it.
1,KEEP YOUR BABY,"A mother who surrenders her baby for adoption NEVER gets over the loss. In fact the pain gets worse with time and expecially after reunion. Mothers experience Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Disenfranchised Grief and the children suffer from Attachment Disorders. Adoption is a 5 bil unregulated industry in the US with the babies being the commodities and the mothers being exploited for their babies. Adoption is NOT a ""loving option"" keeping your baby is the loving and natural thing to do. Adoption is not natural. 80% of open adoptions close after 3 months of the adoption finalizing. Do not let anyone convince, coerce or brainwash you into signing those papers you will regret it for the rest of your life. Anti-Abortionists should be ashamed of themselves for promoting adoption and not promoting a mother to keep and raise her own child. This is coercion of the highest order."
3,Okay,"I love the earbuds. They stay in my ears no matter how hard I shake my head. I love the fact that the cord wraps around to one side. The only downfall...while using the 2.5mm jack to plug into my phone, the sound only comes out of one side (like a headset). Therefore, I can't really listen to music with my music phone. The 3.5mm jack plugged into my computer works great and has good sound. So, if you want something to use with your music phone I recommend the MX 203S. I just purchased one to use with my phone; you can hear music and phone conversations in both ears."
2,The Score - Where is Diana Krall ?,The background music in the movie was very good ? I was excited about purchasing the CD until I discovered the CD did not include the jazz heard in the movie. Does anyone know the song title sung by Diana Krall in the movie -and which one of her CD's it can be found on ?
3,Weak,"It can barely see Jupiter, much less Saturn and jupiters moons, Jupiter is a tiny barely viable planet no bigger than a ""bb"" on my 10mm high power piece, highly recommend a Barlow 2x, or the scope is worthless other than looking at the moon. It's only half or a third the power it advertises for and yes I'm in an ideal light condition area, obviously or I wouldn't have seen Jupiter, u can barely see the two verticle orange stripes, was the only way I knew I was looking at Jupiter, sad, get a xt6 or higher, this 4.5 is weak, also definitely not worth the money, same price on the manufacturers site so don't order from amazon"
4,Begginers Stargazer gift,"Gave this to my 13 yr old son as a Christmas gift in Dec 09, he has used it many, many times and still to this day finds it very interesting. Anything that can catch a teenageers attentin in this day and age without having a touch screen or earphones is a miracle. I would recommend this product for it's quality, as well as it's educational value."
3,This is *NOT* original flavor!,"This product as sold as ""original"" but it is modern fruity bubble gum flavored, *not* the ""original"" Dubble Bubble gum flavor from 1928 which was a mixture of cinnamon and wintergreen. That flavor was stopped when the manufacturer, Fleer, was sold to Tootsie Roll. Someone still makes small batches of the original flavor -- but this product is just ordinary modern Dubble Bubble, the same as sold in stores throughout North America. Amazon and/or the seller were kind enough to refund my purchase price but they continue to sell this product with the misleading label."
3,"not as good as atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese","""The Use of Man"" covers familiar territory for those who have read ""Kapo"": Post World War II Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, In this book, Tisma was unable to achieve the same gripping effect as he did in the horrific ""Kapo"". The narrative is rather aimless, and while it may accurately display the dislocation felt by many who lived through this brutal era in Balkan history, it does not make for engaging reading. If you're searching for a thrill on the scale of ""Kapo,"" look elswhere"
3,ME ...a mother goose keesake album,I love Mary Engelbreit's work.....The Mother Goose Keepsake Album wasn't what I expected....I thought it would be of better quality for the price and what I've always gotten with her other products...
3,"This is a great game, but let the buyer beware...","This title is the 6-CD version of the game on corrupt install media. There is a workaround available on the developer's website (egosoft.com) but it will NOT install cleanly without reading up on it first.Otherwise, great graphics and gameplay, and about as open-ended as they come!"
1,So many bugs. . .,"The game plays like a beta test. There's crashing and freezing everywhere, random glitches that stop the plot or keep you from doing things, TONS of features mentioned in the manual were never actually put in, many of the things in the previous game X2 were just omitted because they didn't have enough time, the economy bugs out after a few days, several different ships from different races share the same model, and this game features the worst character animations I've ever seen in a game. The latest patch improved frame rate somewhat and fixed the economy, but it also added a bug causing certain weapons to drop framerate to 1fps, and for many people, it randomly spawned hundreds of pirates and enemy ships (including destroyers and carriers) that would annihilate everything player owned.On another note, the graphics are pretty."
3,Its ok,"You can definitely tell this is early Nicolay production. Not as polished as the Foreign Exchange and Moonbaker's voice isn't very strong either. Its a decent album that has gone totally under the radar. Really no standout tracks on here. If you are a huge Nicolay fan and want to complete your library, I'd say go ahead and give it a try."
3,Re-Color it or Don't -- the Greyscale Stuff is Awful,"I found the shading they used to approximate the colors incredibly distracting. It muddied the art to the point where it seriously impaired my ability to track what was going on with the story. It may sound like a quibble, and you may be able to get past it, but I sure as heck couldn't.Granted, it may have been the work itself. Hey, I know Kirby is God (see Waid, Mark). I know Kirby revolutionized the form. I know it is sacrilidge to badmouth Kirby. I know all of this, but my God, he was a terrible writer. He's the George Lucas of comic books -- a visual genius with a tin ear for dialogue and a slavish devotion to convoluted (and usually unrevealed) backstories. Couple that with the half-tone printing I mentioned before, and you've got a collection only a die-hard Kirby fan could love.Okay, ""The Pact"" is pretty great. I'll give you that. If they ever come out with either a re-colored or BW line art version, I'll give it another shot."
2,Great Saga Spoiled by Black and White Printing,For those of you who love Jack Kirby....Skip this one. It takes his classic New Gods and deprives the reader of the colorful atmosphere and mood that made the series so special. Did DC think that new readers would purchase this in black and white? That color would be too expensive? I cannot imagine why the suits at DC decided to publish Kirby's work in this format. Wait for the color version!
4,Bridge Over Contemporary Waters,"After her first attempts at going more ""contemporary"", Barbra at last found her ""voice"" on this album. While some of the songs seem odd choices for the album now, at the time it was released, she was attempting to span the bridge connecting the melodic ""traditional"" style tunes of Bacharach and Legrand, with ""new"" music of Carole King and John Lennon. As one reviewer said at the time (I paraphrase here), "". . .while missing the mark as an album of contemporary rock/pop music, Streisand has proven that perhaps she should have been the one to record the Bacharach/David songbook, instead of Dionne Warwick."" Her accomplishment on ""A House is Not a Home"" clearly supports that supposition, while her rendition of ""I Never Meant To Hurt You"" is, arguably, one of the finest vocal performances EVER, and certainly the best ever made of that lovely and haunting song."
3,Great subject--mediocre writing,"An OCS friend loaned me this book and I couldn't wait to dive in. I had been through Benning OCS in 1965, and fought all around the same area in the Central Highlands, the Chu Pong AO, have even humped through LZ X-Ray several times. After finishing, I had three thoughts: (1) I would've been honored to serve under Rick when he was a platoon leader--he was damn good, and his men were lucky; (2) What an example he set on 9/11! He truly exemplified John 15:13, ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends""; and (3) the book really seemed kind of poorly written. There was too much about their Africa days and not enough about 9/11, too much about his two wives, and nothing about why Rick turned away from the Army later--even resigning his commission."
4,"Only book of its kind: yes, kids are sexual too.","Probably most parents will find this book to be ""too much about sex"" for their children - although nothing in the book is inappropriate. This is the only book I reviewed that mentioned nothing about pregnancy (there is a brief mention of fertilization). Instead, it's all about being familiar with your body (there are several drawing exercises, and a workbook is available to purchase separately), good kinds of touching, masturbation, and in general helping the child to decide for him or herself what ""sexy"" means. There's also some brief discussion about partnerships (heterosexual or homosexual). The drawings are simple lines, and there's very little clinical language. This is a great book for open-minded, sex-positive families to share."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I figured that since this was a new release it would be like the new Thomas movie, ""Master of the Rails"", which my son and I both love. But this is the old Thomas and this in itself would not be so bad if it wasn't a bunch of ten minute clips of holiday themed Thomas stories that begin with the opening music of the show and end with credits, only to begin again with the opening music and end again with more credits. You get the point right? If it wasn't for the free Take Along Holiday Thomas train that comes with it, I would have felt this a complete waste of my money."
2,not happy,This dvd isnt a new edition. Its an old version and I see that the toy comes with two magnetic clips on each side but nowhere can i find the other ones so that it can connect. Im really disappointed. My son loves the toy so much. I was really hoping that I could find the others so he can connect them
3,Not a happy camper,"Spin & Fix ThomasI ordered the Thomas Spin & Fix Train along with the Thomas Hero DVD for $54.97two or three days ago.When I went back on line (Wednesday Dec.16,2009)the Thomas Spin & Fix was reduced and now you can get the Thomas Holiday Express all three for $52.47.I realize they have the right to do this but it's the timing that bothers me."
3,Fiesta Dinnerware,"The color was not what I expected. The cup is too small for my use. Other than that, I like the set, but would not order it again."
2,Look else where if you want a good set of everyday dishes...,"The colors are nice but that's about where the appeal ends. They are extremely heavy for dishes making them harder to balance and hold, especially for children. They also become scratched very quickly and it's not just from stacking them, though that would be bad enough. Everyday use with your knife and fork leaves marks too. In general I found the bowls and salad plates to be to small. There is no lip on the bowl so you can't hold anything hot in it with your bare hands. I recommend looking else where if you want a good set of everyday dishes."
1,did not get,i ordered this item 5 months ago was told by amazon that i would get this item and it was avaliable and then after 5 months they tell me that they cant get it and it is still avaliable on there web site as far as im concerned amazon is not worth shopping if they cant hold there promises and say it is avaliable please take this very seriously when ordering from amazon thanks
3,A little off,"The sword itself is great for the price. The weight is nice and it shipped right on time. My sole complaint is that when I recieved it the blade itself was offset on the hilt. This makes sheathing and unsheathing problematic at times. I have yet to figure out how to loosen the bolt at the base of the sword to fix this issue as the decorative part at the bottom that the tassle attaches to makes for a very cramped working space. Again, for the price this sword was well worth it."
4,Maste Tai Chi Sword- Buy it.,"Master Chinese Tai Chi Practice Sword Well Balanced NewThis Sword Is amazing for the price. Great Balance, and a secure feel for practice, Though the tip is slightly sharp, Due to the way the edges are dulled. The polished steel is gorgeous, and it is well and securely packaged when shipped, so You have no worries about it being damaged on delivery. I have used it for practice of Wushu forms (Eight Immortals, Mainly) and for solo Tai Chi practice.Buy it. Great Deal for the money."
1,awfull,"this product is not worth the money, is very bad finishing, blade is opaque has no balance and paint seams to be made with college paint!my worts bought ever, and most important is not nearly close to the pictureDon't lose your money on it"
2,"Is not a ""learning"" or ""duplicating"" remote","I misinterpreted ""smart coding"" and ""MegacCode programming technology"" to imply that it was like the visor remote built into my car--that is, that you could hold another remote up to it and program it by copying the signal. Nope. You have to be able to program the receiver of the gate or garage door opener.Oddly, I have not found any garage/gate openers on Amazon that could learn, or duplicate, the signal of another remote as do the Homelink remotes now installed in many new cars. I did, however, find such a remote for ten bucks (twenty with shipping) on that most popular of auction sites. As I live in a gated community and did not want to pay the $70 for another remote, one that wouldn't be of use to me after moving, the inexpensive duplicating variety was ideal for my needs."
5,love it,I love it becuace now i dont have to get out of the car to open the garage door. I ordered it one dat and four day later its in mail box cant get any better than that.
4,Research,"Used this book for research for a paper in my masters program. Very informative, good information, and gives good references"
3,Jimmy's Got The Blues,"With ""Rituals"", Jimmy Dillon veers towards the blues, with mixed results. The dobro that pops up here and there sounds sweet and suits his voice well, and 3 or 4 of the songs are up to the quality of his earlier ""Bad and Blue"" album, but too many of these songs sound generic, and the overall shift to the blues feels like a marketing ploy. But after so many years of wowing them in the clubs while the labels remained indifferent, if marketing ploys are what it takes to get Jimmy Dillon's music out there, I'll take it..."
5,Another excellent volume from the American Poets Project,"William Carlos Williams: Selected Poems (American Poets Project)As stated in another one of my reviews, every single Library of America volume I've ever purchased (including volumes from the American Poets Project) have been of the highest quality, superbly executed and just plain beautiful.Already possessing several volumes of William Carlos Williams work, I purchased this compact, delightful volume as a gift for my oldest son (who shares my appreciation for both great literature generally, and poetry specifically). Upon its arrival (delayed, once again, by amazon's ridiculously slow delivery) I was more than pleased, and felt proud to be presenting my son with such a first rate representation of W.C.W.'s work."
4,plastic paddles are great,"These paddles are great, they are a lot lighter in weight than the wooden paddles, and they are the same size. These work at lot better than the wooden ones, since we use them in the pool and they are constantly getting wet. Over time, the wooden ones got rather heavy from getting wet and finally broke. The price is a bit cheaper than the wooden paddles and I feel they were a great deal. Comes with two balls which seem to have no bounce, but when you start using them they warm up and you get a good return off the paddles."
2,Poor Quality & NOT a Ping Pong Paddle,"When ordering these rackets, the reviews or vendor descriptions indicated that the rackets were good for use as ping pong rackets. We quickly discovered that the balls did not bounce well on the new ping pong table and that the paddles were of such poor quality that the first time the kids (11 year old girls) used them, the edges chiped."
1,unreliable,"After about a week of use it kept resetting itself to farenheit from celcius, and the battery had to be removed to reset it. Just pressing the toggle did not work. About a week later it stopped working altogether."
5,A child's-eye view of life in Mexico,"When Families of Mexico was released in 2006 (Families of the World series) the positive response was great enough to warrant a second disc that follows the daily lives of Mexican children and their families, resulting in this month's release More Families of Mexico. No familiarity with the first disc is required to enjoy this new release, as each episode stands alone.Very enjoyable, your children will get a great taste of Mexican culture, geography, lifestyle, and more.For full details regarding the latest three releases in the Families of the World series of DVDs (Guatemala, Panama, and More Mexico), please see my review of Families of Guatemala."
1,"Forget it, not even for hard core Wes fans.","Disconforme (Definitive Records) strikes out with this load of nonsense. This was a period when Hamp was recording commercial R&B records, a la Louis Jordan. Wes is barley audible on these recordings and does not play one solo.The remastered tapes sound good considering the primitive recording technology. The liner notes are awefull, however all personal and recording date information is well documented.Don't wate your money, not even hard core Wes fans will dig this."
4,For Newbies,"I think of this as a book for people who don't have much experience with making Thanksgiving Day dinner. Which, considering that there are always people for whom cooking such a dinner is a new thing, is good. I like the starters, especially the soups and salads, and I particularly like the desserts, which are mainly apple crisps, poached pears, and the like. Definitely worth consulting."
3,These types of films are usually about men adjusting to civilian life.,Interesting because it's from a female perspective returning home after being deployed and her adjustment of being back home .
3,Solid indie movie,"Good performances and an important issue. Not sure it's Academy Award material, however. But it is a good watch and makes one think."
1,NOt as described !!! Don't buy,"First of all the picture you see and the hitch is different. I could have bought this hitch for $30 less from ACE.This is cheating to me. And the most anoying and an acceptable part is ,in the description there is no statement that say drilling is needed. That is the only reason that I bought this thing. The drilling part cost me additional $60 .If your car is Dodge Grand Caravan, Town and country, Don't buy this hitch"
1,not as described,hitch did not fit and I am going to have to adapt it to the truck it will not work on toyotas!!!
5,Best receivers on the planet!,I've been using Reese hitches for years and have yet to find a comparable or better made one for the money. These are heavy duty enough for the most demanding tows.
5,Excellent initial experience with St. Benedict,"My mother gave this book to all her sons (including me) for Christmas a year ago. This was my first exposure to Saint Benedict and his Rule. At that time I had very little exposure to the monastic life. As I read this book I could really begin to appreciate the devout nature of Benedict and his followers. It is clear that these men who give up their lives for Christ, these monks, truely have a calling to this vocation.I really liked the interpretation that went along after each rule by Dr. Longenecker. This was especially valuable as I had not been experienced these teachings before. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the contemplative life."
2,"Performs ok, but underpowered","This product is ok, but you can buy better that don't use most of their production money for infomercials. Motor blew out when trying to juice a pineapple. For $100, you can get juicers with over 700watts of power, not just 350 watts."
2,wilco is great but this book....,lacks any true purpose other than to rehash information that is readily available on any music website online. I don't really see the point. Do a google search and learn about them first hand instead of spending your hard earned cash only to fill the pockets of the hack who put this book together.
4,Nice selection,"Music is something personal and I like most of the songs. It came on time and in good condition. I would have liked to see a few more of her all time hits, more like a greatest hits albam. Crossing groups and publishers is always a problem in this type of case."
4,Grace Slick,"For all of you Hippie Grace Slick fans out there, this is a totally must hear cd. I admit I'm obsessive/compulsive w/the Jefferson Airplane music and I think Grace has the most expressive gifted voice I've ever heard. The Great Society was her first gig. The band plays simple music compared to JA; however, not to be dismissed by any means. The GS has cool melodic mesmerizing songs that are reminisent of a time gone by, like no other. Before the coke, before the smack, before the hard drugs. Yes, it was a softer sweeter parade. The time when I was a teenybopper, life was simple, the cool groovy people were together and loved one another. The Eastern influence of the Slick brothers I really dig. Enjoy and thank you Great Society."
1,disappointing product,"I thought replacing some Christmas miniature bulbs would be easy, However, I could get none of these to work. Also, be careful opening the package-when I opened the package, the bulbs came flying out."
3,Nice convenience but tends to tilt,"I have a pair of these 30- inch-distribution trees and have found them helpful in getting my North Star lantern up high enough to allow me to see what I'm cooking on my propane stove. Still, 30 inches is a bit short for illuminating a camping area, though once perched on top of a propane tank, these stalks are close to the right height.Being able to run multiple propane devices from a single tank is a nice convenience, and I have not had any issues with the valves or connections after several years of use.However, one issue that gives me pause is the tendency for the tree to tilt or sway a bit because the ""kickstand"" that secures it on the tank seems to work itself loose. Also, I think these trees are bit pricey for what you get---at the very least, Coleman could throw in a canvas sling bag for storing and hauling. (I did not pay anywhere close to this price for either of mine, scoring the second one for $1 at a yard sale.)"
4,The smell ain't half bad.,"My wife loves this stuff. I have seen no mice since she started saturating the house with it. If she is happy, I am tickled pink."
3,Not Very Effective Against Rodents,"I purchased Peppermint Oil based on reports it would drive off rodents. It initially appeared to work but failed to continue to do so, even though it had been freshly applied. I guess the Nordic Gray's got used to the product's pleasant odor."
4,It does what it says on the cover,"As an experienced user of Outlook 98 I thought that there would be little for me to learn, how wrong I was. This book takes you through all the basic features of Outlok 2000, such as email, contacts etc, and goes on to cover much more including a clear and immediately practical explanation of using custom forms. All of the chapters cover the features in a very practical way allow you to immediately use the functionality of the application. Very highly recommended !"
2,A letdown,"I am a huge Eloisa James fan, but was not thrilled with this book and had to force myself to finish it. It is very clear even without ever knowing more books would follow that was her intention, a setup. Too much time was spent explaining each sister over and over again so we could truly get a sense of them. I felt that Tess really deserved a true story of her own, not one thrown into the mix of all the many explanations. I thought Imogen would NEVER finally run away with her love as we were told she would by reading the back cover. The story was very slow paced and instead of sitting down and finishing it the way I have done with all of her books prier it took me three days. Then suddenly when there are less than 50 pages left it grew interesting. It was truly a letdown but I hope the ones to follow will be better without all the explaining. We can only hope."
3,"Good, but not great","This is my first book by Eloisa James. She is an excellent writer, and I enjoyed this novel--my favorite genre, Regency romance--but I would have enjoyed it more if the pace hadn't been so plodding throughout much of the book. Too talky at times, too much dialogue, not enough action. But I certainly plan to read at least one more book in the Essex series."
4,Nice Set of Some Fine 1960's Tunes By A Semi-Forgotten Band!,"The best songs here still hold up well. They are ""Where Were You When I Needed You"", and ""Let's Live For Today. Both have some nice melodies and harmonies ,and lyrics that have some meaning even 35 years or so later! This is a fine Series that includes some of the ""second tier"" musical acts of 25-40 years ago, plus some really top acts of the time, like the Moody Blues and Supremes, and it's fine hearing some of these releases brought back to life! The Grassroots had a few top 40 hits, some of the best of the day too! So this is your chance to catch some of these fine releases that are otherwise somewhat hard to come by today!"
4,Oldies Lover,"If you want the original sound of the Grass Roots, this is the CD to add to your collection!"
3,Not her best-more typical romance novel,"I usually love this author, but I found this book predicatable, not very imaginative, and hard to believe the assorted plot points. Maybe she churned this one out more quickly and didn't give it the same level of thought. It's simply OK."
4,Sequel,Entertaining follow up to Falling Home. All in all a fair read. I would purchase again. It follows the same story line.
3,Enjoyable Read,This was an enjoyable read. Good escape and nicely written.I do look forward to a Karen White book and she continues to surprise me with new stories and likeable characters.
3,Good but not great.,Nice read but not as well writtenas I'd anticipated. I put the book down many times times because it was slow. The end gets better so keep reading.
5,Another one I couldn't put down,"This is the first book I read by Karen White and I hope to see more from her. Her writing style is starkly and humorously descriptive. An example is when one of Joe's children hands Suzanne his toy airplane and ""she reacted as though he'd handed her a large insect."" Perfect! Wonderful. I can both see and feel that reaction. Just what I want from an author. Good story, not too sappy, not really that predictable, a little non-believable in parts, but an overall good read. I didn't realize this was a sequel and I'm glad I didn't. I like the mystery surrounding Suzanne and Joe."
4,not low impact,"I actually really enjoyed the video and felt it was well done. It was a great workout and i liked the different levels. A word of caution- after doing the video for 4 days in a row my knees and ankles were killing me. I have a history of knee pain and had to stop running because of it. This video using jumping type exercises (butt kicks, jumping jacks, etc.)as its primary source of cardio in the ""cardiac interval."" One of the girls does the lower impact version, but i found this did not provide as tough of a workout as a I wanted and still left me with hurting knees. If you have bad knees like me this video may not be for you. But good quality video, 4 stars."
3,"Great workout, false 20lbs in 30 day claim","I first tried this workout when it was added to my ondemand menu with comcast. I have become skeptical of Jillian because it seems as if she just attaches her name to any product...i.e. her diet pills, any trainer/nutrition expert will tell you diet pills don't work and aren't safe.However the release date (2008) of this video is before she really started digging for cash.This is a killer workout, I have been doing the EA Active workouts and was getting bored, and Jillians routine involves a lot of combo moves which saves time (ex: lunges with bicep curl) And the intermittent cardio keeps your body moving.Don't fall victim to the 20 lbs in 30 days claim as this is not possible. You can safely lose 1-2 lbs a week, and honestly if you are overweight and lose 20lbs in a month, imagine how much excess skin you will have."
3,Disappointing,"I purchased this DVD with anticipation, but was disappointed.First off, the warm up exercises did not work opposing muscle groups, and to think of doing each section 10 days for a total of 30 days means a lopsided muscle use.Secondly, the routines were uninspired. Moves were basic, making them easy to follow; but the lack of imagination in the routines left me feeling a bit bored. Jullian's cuing was good and her safety explanations included demonstrations - a real benefit.On the positive side, this is a good workout for getting metabolism burn in only 20 minutes. I exercise to videotapes regularly, but still felt this one the next day. Having said this, though, I found the negative points to be sigificant enough that I have gotten rid of my tape after only 5 viewings. It is too monotonous and there are too many good workouts that are balanced and stimulating to have to make myself do one that is imbalanced and boring."
4,"Great workout, but cut to the chase",I love this workout DVD but they force you to watch the entire intro/promo before you start the workout. Next and Fast Forward are prohibited until you've wasted about 3 minutes watching them try to sell more stuff.
5,Awesome work out,Great workout. I had to slow down on it due to a heart condition but in the week I made it through I felt so much better. Seems like it was easier to breath and I could make it through without breaks. As soon as I can get my heart under control ill be back to shredding! Great workout
5,Great Workout!,"This is an amazing video! I do it with my friend who is not a fit and it allows flexibility in workout level for us, so we both get great workout in! It is a perfect video for the days I cant make it to the gym or a bonus workout when I do!"
4,It works,It is really hard! The first day I did it I was sore for about 3 days. I have only been doing this for about 3 weeks and I can feel my body getting stronger. If you want to get toned up its a good dvd to buy. I can knock out 20 minutes every day instead of spending hours and throwing away money at the gym if you're a busy on the go person.
2,"Seemed promising, but let down","When I read the reviews I saw that many people complained of knee pain, I blew it off and assumed they were ""old people"". I got through 17 straight days before I had to stop. The moves not only affected my knees, but my ankles hurt so bad that I was hobbling. I'm 23 and in good shape. I don't think it was the exercises themselves, but the pace. The video is so fast that you don't have time to focus on the movements and make sure that you're keeping good form. I would suggest a work out based on a number of reps, rather than a set time."
4,Great Workout!!,Boy does this give you a great workout. This is an excellent video to have when we only have a short time to workout. My calves were burning the next day. The only thing that aches are my knees and I think it is all the jumping we do. I have only tried workout 1 so I am looking forward to the rest of the videos. Great value too!
4,Good.,I think Jillian is great! The video is definitely what she makes it out to be..hard and it works! The only thing I had a problem with was the quality of the DVD...it must have had scratches on it because the video was skipping around..other than that it was fine! I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to lose weight.
5,Great!,I'm 13 days into the shred and I can definitely see a difference in my abs and arms! Recommend to all who hate hitting the gym
4,Laura's Review of Shred,"I'm in pretty good shape - I run Marathons. However, these 20 minute workouts KICKED MY BUTT!!! They are awesome! The only thing I would improve about this video is to have more workouts on it. I would have paid more to have more of a variety to choose from. Three workouts is good, but will get boring quickly. It would have been cool to have 3 different workouts at each of the 3 levels. Other than that, this DVD is GREAT."
5,Absolutely worth it!!,"I usually randomly pick levels on this, all the levels are tough and very effective. I have more tone in my arms and thighs and the ab work is great too but may need to be supplemented with more crunches and plank work. I highly recommend this dvd, especially when one has little time to spare. It is high intensity all the way if you do not stop. Thanks Jillian this is awesome!!!"
4,Is there any Jillian workouts that are great for men???,"I am 25 years old and have a 4 year old son, My husband is in school full time and works two jobs on top of that. Needless to say we both are to the point where we need a consistant daily workout from home because of the fact that we don't have time to go to a gym. I dont really need to loose weight but i do need to get toned bad!! and my husband really wants to loose weight and get firm in is abs. I have heard alot of Jillian's work outs and I just ordered me ""buns and thighs"" and the six week six pack ab work out. would any of these benefit my husband as well or is there something else that would really benefit him?? THANKS!"
5,The BEST workout DVD out there!!,"I just started this 4 days ago and it literally kicked my a** from day 1! I was so sore the next day that I could barely walk, and every day has been more of the same. I'm still on workout one because there are times when I have to push myself on some of the exercises to the point that I just want to stop, it's so hard. I have done a lot of other workout DVDs and this one is simply the most effective in the shortest amount of time. There are no breaks, no ""marching it out"" like so many of the other ones do. You will feel awful during and after, but then you'll feel AWESOME after a few days! Seriously, if you're on the fence about buying this DVD, just do it, you have NOTHING to lose but inches :)"
3,Shredded,"I did this workout, which I work out quite often 5 hours a week, and 20 min of this had me dripping sweat on beginner level. It was intense and I thought I was in good shape. I'm 36 and notice that on level 2 doing the plank jumping jacks made my ankles sore. I definitely have a good work out doing it but feel it later too."
4,Awesome,"At first, you want to stop. It's hard if you're not used to constantly working out, but this DVD gets you moving and sweating. You stop if you need to, but you Jillian doesn't let you stop. Sometimes, you feel like she's right there telling you to keep going, which helps. I did 2 days so far and I'm sore, but I feel great. I'm motivated to do this and can't wait to see results. You have to buy weights though, so if you don't want to spend money on ANY equipment, don't buy this, but if you can spare $15-$20 on weights, go for it. I like this DVD :]"
4,What a workout!!!,"I'm just getting started with excersize after having my 2nd baby 6 months ago. I was sore for a week after doing the beginner 20 minute workout. I think its a great video and a very intense workout. I'm happy I got it, but will work on some other videos with less intensity before making this workout routine. Great video for my collection. Wonderful workout if you only have short time intervals for working out. This video will definitely produce major results if you can stick to it."
5,30 days shred,"I run marathons, ride bike, go the gym regularly and thought I was in a somewhat good shape. This DVD brought me back to reality. I thought it would be easy and I could do the workout whenever I did not feel like going to the gym, but still wanted to do something so I would not feel too guilty. I was wrong, this 30 minutes workout kicked my B.. the first time I did it. Julian Michaels is great, she pushes you and you wouldn't dare stop early. I you are looking to get in shape and are ready to work hard get this DVD, if you are looking for an easy workout this DVD is not for you."
4,Will get you sweatin in no time!,"This is tough and you instantly will start sweating from doing this workout. I really love it, and the things she asks to do are fairly easy to pick up, unlike some of the other exercise DVDs I've tried (I always feel lost doing TurboJam). Just note that you will need weights for the DVD. The only thing that is s lightly weird for me is how sometimes you see the demonstrators doing the exercises in time with the music, and other times it's not in time. Really throws me off since I like to do the reps along with the beat."
4,Good workout,"I have only done the first stage (I'm hoping to get to 2 and 3 at some point!) and I really like it! Jillian is a great instructor and I love her motivating tid-bits. It is also great if you are in a time crunch to fit in a workout. In just 20 minutes, you'll have worked your arms, legs, abs and even fit in some cardio! I love it!"
5,Believe the Hype,"This program whipped me into the best shape of my life in record time. Loved the progression of the program, love that there was always a modification, love that I lost 2 pant sizes and had biceps and abs when the whole thing was said and done. Most of all, loved Jillian. You won't be disappointed in this one, guys."
5,Well worth the $,"I would highly recommend this video for those looking to tone and slim but who don't want to spend too much time working out. Each workout is only 25 minutes and it is broken down into three circuits, plus a warm up and cool down. In each circuit 3 minutes are dedicated to strength training, 2 minutes to cardio, and 1 minute to abdominal work. This format makes it easy for quitters like me to push through a hard work-out since I know whatever I'm having trouble with will be over soon. The three different workouts keep things interesting and pack a punch. The only improvement would be an extended cool down period -- I often need to stretch more afterwards."
1,Ruined my knees after 7 days,"I was so excited to try out this product. A friend of mine looked fabulous after having her kids and she let me in on her ""Shred"" secret. With little time to spare for workouts these days w/ children, I was excited to get quick results in 20 minutes a day. After just 7 sessions, I was unable to walk down a set of stairs without the inside of my knees feeling like they had pins & needles in them. I have NEVER had knee issues and am in good shape (I worked out through my 7th month of pregnancy). I got an orthopedic opinion and it turns out some of the exercises in level 1 (that's as far as I got) are AWFUL for your knees - butt kicks & side (forward) lunges primarily. The over-extension of the knee is awful. During the exercise, I remember thinking, 'this doesn't feel right, but I guess I just need to push through.' Well, if you feel this way, I would warn you to stop!"
4,great purchase,I received the item in a timely manner and in great condition. I was happy with the service and the item itself.
5,Great Workout!,"While I have never done/seen the workout personally, I gave this to my mom for christmas and she has really enjoyed it. She is an active person but usually just walks for exercise. The workouts really make her sweat and sore...and are easy to get done since they don't take a lot of time."
3,Had my hopes up,"Not as good as I hoped it would be. I heard a lot of jazz about it, but I was sort of under the impression there would be 30 days worth of work out variations and there are only three different workouts so that was a bit of a disappointment. It gets boring after the first two really.If you are in decent shape already, while the cardio aspect of the lowest level gets your heart pumping and gets you breathing heavily, it's not much of a work out. My arms were slightly sore for the first two days, but that was it. My abs didn't feel a thing in workout one.From what I've heard, they won't until workout three, but I am so annoyed with it already I haven't made it that far. Because it was not as effected as I had expected."
2,Not the best option,"I purchased this video so I could work out at home those days when I couldn't get to the gym. I'm in my twenties and on the chubby side, so I'm not used to working out. The exercises are a bit too hard if you aren't already in shape, which causes frustration instead of the desire to keep going. I wanted to feel energized but instead I felt worse than when I started, so I put the dvd away and decided that the gym was better for me, since I could start slow and work my way up. My suggestion is, if you're overweight and want a video you can keep up with, THIS ISN'T IT."
4,"Excellent exercise, however language issue in our household!","I am very pleased with the excercise & motivation in this DVD. HOWEVER, I do have a problem with some language that she uses that is not acceptable in our household. She calls one exercise A--[...] (we only use the words bottom or buttocks in our home) and before the cool down she states that, ""G-D knows you deserve it."" I am sure that this is not a problem for most people, however, we have a variety of ages of children in our household and do some exercise DVDs as P.E. So, if you have the same standards as us, be forewarned. If not, enjoy!"
5,Love it!,This dvd is awesom!!! Like Jillian says this 20 minutes per workout is like doing hours in a gym-Believe it! Jillian is the Best!!! Great dvd!!
5,Kick Butt!!!,"This is one of the best exercise DVDs I have owned. If you have ever seen the punishment that Jillian dishes out on Biggest Loser, then this workout is no exception. I thought I was in pretty good shape, but I thought I was going to die when I started. This DVD is a definite thumbs up for someone who is hardcore about getting in shape and up for a challenge."
3,"Good workout, not great, Jillian on the other hand.......","This workout is good, it's not great however. I am in good shape, workout 5-6 days a week and do cardio and weights.Here's my problem with Jillian - she is way to full of herself and it is annoying, here's some examples:As soon as level 1 starts, Jillian walks in with this ""full of myself"" attitude. Scripted of course; saying to the other 2 girls doing the workout with her, ""so you think you can handle it huh, we'll see"" - obnoxious.Then she gets really full of herself when she says ""I'm hoping you know me, (with a smug look on her face) I'm Jillian"" - not needed, come on.Shortly thereafter she says ""if you want to look like this (as she is pointing to one of the girls) watch her, and you'll get there in no time......right.....ya, right"" - are you kidding me, you are supposed to be encouraging people, not belittling them.So, if you can get past her annoying attitude, it's an okay workout, but not as good as Beachbody."
5,Great workout,Love it. Even at level 1 it is a great workout. Knowing it is only 20 minutes gets you through.
4,Deployed and PUMPED!!!!,"i am on day 4 of 30. i love this workout and started with Level 2. The workout is intense- and only 20 minutes! So basically, there is NO EXCUSE to not do it! Surely everyone has 20 minutes a day to give to bettering themselves- dont even lie! 20 minutes of a good A#$ whooping! YEAAHH!! :) Before you know it, the workout is over and youre feeling better than ever!i am deployed in Afghanistan and got 3 months left.. i am most def doing this for myself but i would love to surprise my husband!!. i am 5'5 and 174 lbs right now. My ideal weight would be 150. if anyone has any tips or a success story about losing a significant amount of weight in 2 months- [...]best wishes!-Jessica"
5,Will make you sweat!,"I used to do The Firm workouts which typically last 45 min and never really broke much of sweat. But Jillian's 30 Day Shred leaves me dripping in sweat after only 25 min. I have been using this DVD for almost 2 weeks now and have seen a vast improvement in my endurance. I have only lost 3 pounds, but more importantly I can tell that I am getting stronger and more in shape. I started by switching between the first two levels and now I rotate doing a different level each day. Some of the moves in level 3 are too difficult for me so in order to get a full workout, I substitute those tough moves with easier ones from levels 1 and 2. Overall, these are great workouts."
5,Get This Video!,"I ordered 30 Day Shred based on other recommendations and I think it's great. I highly recommend this for people who are beginning to lose weight or who are stuck in an exercise rut. You get a decent workout in about 25 minutes and you can modify it to your level of fitness.And the results - using this DVD and a low-calorie diet I am losing 2-3 lbs. a week. As far as I'm concerned these are GREAT results, and are double what I would see with diet alone. You will love this DVD!"
5,[...] Personal Trainer!,"I hate work out DVD's for the most part, I'm not coordinated enough to do aerobic dance-like moves, so this workout is more like a personal trainer is right there with you pushing you to your limit. I hate the disco-like music that accompanies most workout DVD's, but this isn't too bad, just keeps a beat to the workout. All you need is a set of hand weights and a mat if you don't have carpeted floors. Wanna get results and your butt kicked to work off the flab and get a good cardo workout? This is the DVD for you. No whining!"
5,I love it!,"I love it! My husband too :) oh, I use it, and my husband enjoys the results , lol ! I used to go to gym before, but after having baby, there is no time to leave the house. So only opportunity is exercise at home. Only after first week using the DVD my hubby said that my butt got firmer , LOL! I'm using second level now and I feel my body is getting stronger and leaner.I got this DVD only to get my body stronger and leaner, because 6 month ago I gave birth to my baby and I lost the baby weight already :)Overall, great DVD, but I am not sure if it is possible to lose all the weight it says, because I'm 5'7 and weight 122 lb ( same as pre-baby), so I don't need to loose too much weight, only to gain strength and get my belly and bottom back in shape....Good luck!"
5,"Simple, very effective, kick-butt workout!",I am an advanced exerciser and have a hard time finding challenging workouts.I love this workout because the moves are simple (no complex choreography to trip over) and very effective.I also love the integrated strength training with cardio. This is one of the highest calorie burning workouts I have in my collection.I actually do all three workouts back-to-back in one sitting which takes about 1 1/2 hours and burns about 900 calories.There is no time to be bored with this video. This is a fast paced workout with many quick sequences which makes the time seem to fly by.
5,Love It...even after a year!,"What a workout! I've been using this dvd, rotating it with a few others, for almost a year now and it still makes me sweat. Each workout is only 20-25 minutes, but it's definitely a workout. As you progress towards Level 3, the workouts incorporate more movement into each exercise. Where in Level 1 you would be in a lunge position and just move your arms, in Level 3 you would be doing lunges AND arm movements at the same time, so you're using more muscles and working the core. I'm not completely sold on the 3-2-1 method, but it does give the workout a nice variation. It didn't take long to conquer Level 1, but now I rotate between Levels 2 and 3 and have increased the weights I use from 3lb to 5lb and am very happy with the results. Since it's only 20-25 minutes, I'll usually combine this workout with something else (running, Wii Fit, or another dvd that focuses on one area)."
4,Jillian Michaels 30 day shred,"The video is tough but has easy to learn moves. The instructor is always talking and encouraging you. I could sure feel my muscles the next day, it felt good."
4,Quick and Effective,"The DVD is quick and effective. In the first five min. I was sweating and in need of some ice cold H2O. I work out four day a week in the gym, doing mostly intense weight lifting. This video incorporates both cardio and weight lift toning, which helps create a tight toned look that many woman want to achieve. Today was my first day doing the workout, so I don't have the physical results all the other reviews talk about. From the way I was panting and legs trembling I guarantee I will see wonderful results. Love Jillian's style and motivation."
5,Tough but encouraging,I really like this dvd. Jillian is right up my ally. She's tough and won't let you get away with wimping out but at the same time gives ample encouragement. I also enjoy the comradarie she has with the other participants. My only complaint is that the background is a little boring. I like outdoor venues best. I definatley recommend this video! :)
4,Hard,"This dvd is hard for me. The push ups get me everytime! But, it's definitely an effective workout! I yet to advance to any higher level than level one. Jillian is a tad intimidating--and it's just a dvd!"
2,Watch your knees!,"be warned it is mostly high impact (lots of jumping jacks).. I've always been very active, fit, lean and 33 yrs old and this workout affected by knees.. for this reason, I don't think I will stick to it."
5,A perspective from one that doesnt exercise often. . .,"Okay, let me start by saying that I don't exercise regularly. I try to get in 30 minutes at least 2-3 times a week rather it is walking, doing the elliptical, or just doing some cardio. I would say that I am in average shape but I could stand to lose 5-10 pounds.To say that this DVD KICKED my butt is an understatement! Level 1 was a struggle for me. I think I need a level -1. It was almost discouraging for me!! However, if you can stay focused and do what you can, it will pay off. It really is a great workout and you can definitely feel the difference. My legs were sore for 2 days after my workout!I'm not a big Jillian Michaels fan, in fact, I find her sort of annoying! But let me assure you she will push you in this video and you will get a good workout!If you want a good workout that will truly give you a feeling of an accomplishment this is your DVD!! Just stick with it and start shredding :-)"
4,Jillian's kick your butt more than 30 day thing,"OK... I'll be honest I like it so far. It was literally the hardest work out I've ever done the first day, but after I had done it for about three days it was great! I've lost 4 lbs so far and I'm seeing a vast improvement in my stamina in house hold chores and keeping up with my eight month old daughter. If you don't have any physical restraints like bad knees I say give it a try."
2,She should have done better,"I work out alot in my home gym using DVD's to get me going. This is the first time ever I heard myself wheezing after the cardio to core section. I think with all her expertise, she could have done better."
2,"bad for your knees, and not a very hard workout","I'm in fairly good shape and workout 5-6 times per week but want to lose 5 lbs, so I tried out this video on two separate occasions (did the first level day 1, 2nd level day two etc) and after the 3 days had dreadful knee pain which I never get with any of my other work outs (I do various strength training and cardio DVDs).To make matters worse, I didn't find her workout particularly challenging. I barely sweat at all and just when it was becoming a little challenging, the time was up on that segment, so never got to the point of having to push myself. I'm done going back to this video, a big disappointment overall!"
2,Okay Workout,"I haven't completed the 30 days yet due to various issues. The dvd is a good workout though. She swears (""@ss"") in the workout which bothers me. If you have young children you might not want them around so they don't hear it. I'm hoping to start the dvd again when I can find time."
3,"good challenge, tough on joints","I like how challenging this short workout is, but I find that my knees are killing me when its over, the jumping jacks and jumping rope really aggravates them. I'm ready to move up to a higher level but not sure that my knees can take it. Have never had this problem with a workout dvd before. I would recommend this to others that are pressed for time, its hard but you know you can stick with it for 20 minutes, it goes by fast."
4,Love it!,"A great workout for folks who want to push themselves. I saw real, immediate results. The only thing I would change is that you can't fast forward through the introduction."
2,Too much emphasis on shoulders,"I just finished the first workout immediately after a hard jog. I really like how she does circuits, but she puts WAY too much emphasis on the shoulders. A person should focus on the deltoids twice a week max. I also take muay Thai three times a week and Brazilian jiu jitsu twice a week, and I simply wanted to add a great cardio and abs workout to my regimen. I wish she did 3 min cardio and 2 min strength training instead of the reverse. I was very unimpressed with the cardio. I wasn't even breathing hard. So far, I am liking Billy Blanks Boot Camp MUCH better. I guess this would be a good workout for those who are not already active, though..."
3,Disappointing,"It is hard to submit a review for this video. I did follow it and enjoyed it - the workout flies by because she gives you no rest and you really break into a sweat. I was so hopeful for this workout and I stuck to it, but I had to stop. It is incredibly hard on your knees and it wasn't worth the pain and long term damage. I'd rather find a safer workout. My knees were killing me after 3 days of working out on level 1 so I took one day off and continued thinking I just needed to build up endurance - unfortunately that wasn't the case. I wish I could give this video 5 stars, but my knees won't let me."
3,Jillian kicks my butt- literally!,"With two small children, trying to get this postpartum 30 lbs off has been impossible. Neither will let me complete a 45 minute workout video. And they really won't even let me do Jillian's 20 minutes but if and when I can get them both asleep at the same time, I can squeeze it in! She seriously kicks butt. Even on level 1, I feel like my legs can't take anymore! Even after two workouts, I felt stronger and had more endurance. Don't know if it can live up to it's claims of 20lbs in 30 days, but maybe one day the children will let me try it!"
5,Fantastic Starters DVD,"If you wanna get in shape and get your body used to the basic exercise and heart rate it should be used to, this is an awesome workout DVD. It might be a bit tough in the beginning if you're not really used to working out, but that's the whole point. It pushes your body step by step to get to where it should be. There are 3 stages so once you feel your stamina is built on the first stage, move on to the next. Your body needs to be challenged in order to are results! If you feel some muscle pain, you're doing it right. I personally use the McDavid waist trimmer during the workout and I sweat 3 to 4x more in my midsection. Good luck everyone!"
3,"great, but...",The dvd is set up so that I have to watch their commercials before starting the program EVERY TIME. So much for 20 minutes. This is bogus.
3,Not for Everyone,"I understand the fact that the trainer thinks if you only work for 20 min, it should be a difficult workout, but not sure if all the excercises she does are safe. What hit me wrong right off the bat is that she encourages (actually doesnt give an alternative) jumping jacks. I'm no expert, but jumping jacks are NOT good for everyone. They can be very bad for hips and knees. Generally, the dvd is ok. Definitely not for the beginner though. I work out 5 times a week and the beginner session was a little hard for me at first. If you are intermediate and short on time, I believe this is a good dvd for you. Not good for beginners though."
4,Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred,"This is tough. It's difficult for me to get up & down off the floor and there is quite a bit of the necessary. Jillian is awesome! She takes no crap! Definately recommended. It frustrated me not to be able to fast forward to the beginning of the workout. You have to listen to the opening monologe everytime you go to work out. Other than that, indeed a work-out!"
4,Finally a DVD workout I want to do!,"I was definitely searching for a dvd that was more basic cardio, weights, etc...and less 'bouncing around.' I've completed several ABC boot camps and consider myself to be in pretty good shape with decent levels of endurance. That said, level 1 of this work out was relatively intense for a 20 mintue work out. I enjoyed the quick circuit mix-ups and I'm looking forward to the next levels of this dvd and trying out the 2 other dvds of Jillian's (No More Trouble Zones and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism). I will agree that the music is pretty lame. I think the Jillian could take the time to show some more modifications for people who want to do the work out but who are limited by bad knees, etc. I don't mind her 'bully' style. I definitely didn't mind scoring a deal on all 3 dvds for $24 on Amazon with FREE super saver shipping (after I added a $1.50 Degas notebook to my order)."
4,Shredded!,"Like all the other reviewers mentioned, it will kill your knees if you have bad knees and you don't modify any moves. I read the reviews and bought this with the expectation of a killer knee workout and I have somewhat bad knees. However, I just modified certain moves on level 1. For the static lunges/bicep curl I replaced that with a squat and bicep curl. I did level 2 once and I noticed my ankles hurt that day and the next... but I have terrible ankles due to several sprained ankles during H-S Basketball. I have had this for a month and I do it 2-3 times per week and Mtn bike on the weekend. I have changed my diet to lots of fruits and veggies and around 1500 calories a day and I have lost 10 lbs. I had a baby 9 months ago and NOTHING has worked until the shred, and diet changes. I have noticed my arms and legs are toning up. I would recommend it to anyone who understands that there can be knee problems and to modify some moves if you have knee problems."
4,Hard workout but gets easier,The first time I did this I thought I would die. After a few days it was much easier and I did feel alot stronger. I like that it is only 20 minutes. No excuse for not exercising because I don't have time. I travel alot so was able to do it in most hotel rooms because it does not take a lot of space. Only thing I don't like is not being able to skip the intro into the exercises. Others say it gets a bit boring but don't most exercise tapes after a while?
5,LOVED LOVED LOVED the 30 day shred !! :),"So I must say I am 23 years old, 6'4"" tall, female and obese. I have been an athlete my whole life but after finishing college I let myself go. I started weight watchers and was trying to find a DVD I could do at home. I found this DVD at big lots for $5 I was very excited, I ran home and started the DVD and did level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 10 days and level 3 for 10 days. I was absolutely drenched each and every day; I think I only took 2 days off in the 30 days which probably was very healthy. I lost 19.2 lbs in 30 days!!!! I HIGHLYYY HIGHLYY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE all shapes, sizes and ages! :)"
5,total kick butt workout,This workout is amazing...I've been working out for a while now...This workout was very challenging.I love it!
5,will kick your @ss,i dont know about losing the lbs with this video but you will definitely get more toned and lose inches. this workout is no joke. just because its only 20 mins dont be fooled. you will be panting and sweating by the end.
4,It works!,I used it for a month and lost some weight and gained some much loved muscle definition!It has 3 levels for beginners to experts.For the price why not try it?Remember to buy some hand weights though because they are not included.
4,Challenging but Doable!,"This dvd is great for all levels, I think. It pushes you to work hard but does not kill you (I did Insanity last fall and that one KILLS!). Even on the tougher aspects of this workout, you can always say to yourself, hey, there's only 20 minutes total...I can do this for 20 minutes! : ) I think it is a great workout...It will definitely get results if your diet is also in check. : )"
5,Jillian3,"This is a good exercise video, I would buy it again. If I stick with it, I am sureI will get the results I want."
5,LOVE IT!,"This was my first Jillian Michaels purchase and I absolutely love it. She is so easy to follow and it is by far an awesome workout. In just 20 minutes, you work out every muscle in your body. I love her 3-2-1 strategy so that one muscle group doesn't get overworked.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quick workout that REALLY counts."
5,Woow,"My friend told me about this DVD and I was skeptical in the begining. I have been working out for a month now. The first two weeks I was working out on level 1 and 2, the rest of the month I was working out on level 2 and 3 back to back. I can see my body is toned. This DVD is amazing. I wished I bought it long time back. This is definalty long term investment to me."
5,Hard but doable,"I've been doing Level 1 about four times a week for two weeks and plan to go to Level 2 tomorrow. This is a good, hard 20 minutes that definitely gets easier with practice. I feel stronger and more fit already and my clothes are fitting a lot looser. I definitely recommend this product, but it's not for wusses. Be prepared to sweat!"
4,Work Out With Jillian Michaels!,"Are you unable to afford the gym but desire a high-quality workout program? Try Jillian Michaels' 30-Day Shred. She's a tough trainer, but the exercises are simple to do and definitely effective. The advice and three workout programs provided on this DVD are worth more than the little bit of money you will be paying for it."
3,Okay... I Guess.?,"I purchased this workout DVD after I had my second baby. I did read ALL of the reviews before purchase and majority are true.Not really realistic.! Routines can be deemed as elementary but they are very basic and anyone can do them. But it gets boring by the second day.ALSO, if you're expecting to shed pounds in 30 days...she doesn't mention anything about what to eat or not to eat? Of course use common sense but it would be nice to mention SOMETHING!"
5,Fantastic,"To respond to one of the reviewers, this is a best seller because it gets results. I'm down 7 lbs. in the first 7 days doing this workout, along with eating right. Yes, I thought I would die during the first workout, but it's over before you know (20 minutes) it and is very effective. My stamina is totally different in the 10 days I've been working out. I'd recommend this to anyone, even beginners. Just start and level 1 and use the beginner example. And stick with it, because it works."
4,Wow,"I was a bit skeptical of this product, but I love it!! It definatly works you hard, I could feel it after the first day! Cant wait to start seeing the results"
4,A good workout,"This is a good workout, but does not seem to ""flow"". I prefer some of the step workouts that have good choreography to follow. However, this is a decent workout. It was definitely a good value."
4,Jillian kick butt!!!!,"Jillian is like she is on the show. It is tough at first. It says 30 day shred, but I only did it 3 times a week instead of everyday. My muscles were sore for the first week. You need a small set of hand weights and a mat for sit-ups. I liked the fast paced part of it. She changed exercises every 2 minutes. That way if it is difficult, I knew I could last for 120 seconds. Includes jumping jacks, took me back to grade school."
4,Good Work Out,This is a good 20 minutes work out. The ability to do each level is depends on your physical fitness. Try to keep up and do as many reps as they do and you'll be sweating your butt off.
1,STRESS FRACTURE - BUYER BEWARE!!,"On the 29th day of doing the 30 day shred, my two ankles hurt for two weeks straight - then my right foot hurt. It is 3 months after I stopped and it turns out I still have a stress fracture in my right foot. No exercise is worth being in pain for over 3 months."
3,lots of pushups,"i've heard good things about this workout, but i have wrist problems and there are a ton of pushups in this workout, so i've only done the 1st part. eventually, i'd like to do the entire 30 days."
5,wicked workout,"I'm an athletic person, and a stay at home mom. This is an AWESOME dvd. Quick, effective, really really difficult workout that will give incredible results. LOVED this. Hated it, but loved it."
2,Too hard for beginners!,"This is definitley a strenuous workout, but even the level 1 beginner routine is too intense for someone not already in shape. I hurt my knee almost immediately and then my back. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with weak joints."
2,Playmaker,"Well, this is not Colin's best. It is dangerously close to a thrown-together Hollywood hills soft core film. It is rare to see him play nasty. (He plays two characters actually, so his nastiness turns out not to be his real self.) There's some mystery, some twists and turns, some skin. The other actors are wooden, plot is thin."
2,Not thrilled.,"The premise was very interesting -- a woman put together out of the bodies of others -- but where Antieau takes this idea makes little connection with the idea itself. She quickly turns the story into a piece of feminist and New Age propaganda, harking back to an age of serenity when all women and men (clearly in that order) lived in peace and harmony with Mother Goddess Earth. There is no real plot, with what conflict there is (with the dark rapist/incestuous Father Lee) being all dull and predictable and wrapped up in a neat, tiny package at the end.Antieau's word-smithing style also irritated me. She writes in short, choppy sentences, which are regularly not even full sentences. It's like reading Hemingway but with his powerful vision condemned to a utopian New Ageism. On the other hand her choice of words can often evoke powerful imagery, but I found this redeeming feature to be drowned by the rest of the book's lackluster performance.Not recommended."
3,An interesting tale but---,"what was going on with your (apparent) menstruation fetish, Kim? I got sick, literally, reading about all of that ""stuff,"" on and on and------. If you're into the whole ""playing in a muddy field"" trip, fine, but keep it between you and yours. Women getting more aroused at that time of month? Men liking it better? As we say down here, ""Y'all,---YUCK!"" Other than that, and it must be said that THAT is a fairly major part of certain portions of this book, I enjoyed this book. It has an otherworldly feel to it that certainly gets one caught up in the story being told. Check it out, but guys be warned, you're going to wish that Tampax had been around in the days of yore."
4,Legally Blonde Soundtrack,I like the songs on it. It goes well with the movie. The customer service was great. The CD came on time.
3,legally blonde,"this is a really good movie. The soundtrack is ok. Only reason I got it was cause it had the song ""Perfect Day"" on it. But, this movie is one of my faves!"
4,Great!,"I like Samantha Mumba and Mya, but ""watch Me Shine"" is a song that is worth buying the CD for. I want to hear more from her!"
1,"OMG, How can you stand this crap?","This CD sucks. I wouldn't spend my money on this. All I can say is don't waste your money, buy somthing else."
4,Interesting...,"As I'm not too into geneaology and more into cemetery photograhy & rubbings, the second half of this book got more use from me. Great tips on doing gravestone casts and how to ""make"" light to get that perfect shot."
3,Reads rough,Overall story line was pretty good but it reads very rough. Does not flow/read smoothly. I am sorry she passed away. She had potential.
1,Zero,"This book was difficult to read because the lead charters were boring. I don't understand why both charters couldn't work together to solve the mystery of the bracelets instead of butting heads. Additionally, the love scenes were not interesting there was no fire. I have read other Thea Devine books and I was expecting fire works instead I got a fizzle. I hope Thea Devine next effort is more interesting."
2,If you want to go to sleep.............,"I bought this CD based on a review sticker on the packaging. This was a huge mistake. NME said that it was the chill out album of the year. Ok, if you like the kind of chill music that you can fall asleep to then yes I agree! Please do not buy this album expecting an Ibiza, Cafe del Mar, or Serve Chilled series sound. The main review at the top of the page is right on - this is more of a global trance sounding CD, not much else."
3,Hands on tour through Eclipse 2!!! Plugin Development,This book takes you through a tour on plugin development. The main disadvantage of this book is that it is for Version 2 and not Version 3 of Eclipse. Yes you can somehow manage to translate and find your way around. Anyhow this is quite annoying not always successful and maybe one wants to learn more about the special advertised feature of Eclipse 3: rich client platforms. A topic inherently connected to plugin development. Please give us a new version of this book.
5,Thorough and Credible,"When the author of the wildly popular ""The Da Vinci Code"" insisted that his novel was factual, he lit a firestorm among academics and theologians. One response, ""Cracking Da Vinci's Code,"" shot to the top of the bestseller lists. As the film soared to the top of the box office, pastor and theologian James Garlow returned with a dictionary style listing of information that readers and moviegoers will need, if they're interested in the facts, and just the facts. Thorough and credible."
4,heavenly,I can't really say until I've read it but it sounds wonderful. I haven't found a Love Inspired book that I haven't loved. I recommend them all.
5,national audubon North american birds: Eastern region,"Excellent guide for the bird watcher. Great for new bird watchers. This was a gift as I already have one. The person recieving the book states it is the best. He has other books, but this is the best."
1,My homemade toilet monster is about a million times better!,"I bought this product thinking it would be good fun, but found that it didn't surprise or shock anybody.I have found that a better solution is to break off the toilet handle, and then eat about ten cans of chili. That's a toilet monster that people will talk about!"
3,led test light!,It's worth the money better than you would get at Auto zone or some other parts store. I only wish the cord was longer but over all a good product
4,Great Guide!,This guide has been much improved compared to the guide for MMBN3. The only problem I have with this guide is that the boss strategies aren't always helpful.
5,Paul's best yet,"Do youself a favour:But Chris Tomlin See the Morning, Paul Baloche A Greater Song, The Vine Who May ascend?, Desperation Band Who Are You? and Hillsong United United We Stand and you have the five top albums of 2006. Put them on shuffle and you may think you are in heavenThis is Paul B's best yet. We are going to start singing 'Hosanna' in church soon, others to follow I am sure Well doneJohn SnelgroveHong Kong"
5,Great frame that's a little different.,"I'm really surprised at how nice and novel this frame set is. I originally purchased it with just a use for a project in mind, but now I think I'll get a couple more.First of all the worst part. It's smaller than it appears to be. The LARGEST picture size is 4X6, which is the orange tree in the product picture, and they go down from there.Good stuff - Well made, nice looking, and something different.2 pictures fit in each plastic frame back to back, so it's a new adventure every time you turn it. This would be great on some kind of motorized turntable. Otherwise turn it once a week or something and you'll have different views all of the time. The base is slotted all of the way across both vertically and horizontally so that you can position the frames any way you want, you're not stuck to what you see here.Definitely a nice way to display little snapshots you have lying around."
2,do more justice to the original!,"As a native speaker of both English and Japanese, I found myself frustrated reading this translation of a book that held many memories. Having read the original (a gift from a then-boyfriend), I wished to give this book to a friend of mine, who I knew would appreciate the story and messages within. There has been too much lost in the process of interpretation. I think I'll have to try my own hand at translation."
4,test cream,I have been using this cream for about a month and I think it'sbeen working well. I think I will be buying more at later time.
5,I like it,Works nicely I guess I mean it makes me horny but idk it feels good rubbing on chest and face and makes my face and skin super smooth and nice looking. It's more like a high quality lotion and not sure about the other benefits since Cialis Daily is the only thing that helps me and it works wonders. Get it online at [...].
4,Dreamy,"""All out of love"" was a chartbreker. This is his next single. It's also a ballad. It sounds almost like Michael Jackson's ""Earth song"".But I don't like the mixes. All 7 are bad. Boring and annoying."
5,great gloves!,"I have looked long and hard for a warm, waterproof, and tough winter glove. I could not be more pleased with these!!!! I'm a crew chief in the Air Force in Pittsburgh which means I work outside all the time. These gloves give me enough dexterity to do a lot of tasks that others cannot do with normal winter gloves.Also, I work in Pyrotechnics and I do several winter shows a year. These gloves are tough enough that they have survived 3 shows. A normal pair of work gloves you'd buy at sears would normally last that long before they are worn through. I still use these gloves every day at my full time job at the base. 6 other people i work with have purchased them already.Highly recommended....I'd also like to add that during a fireworks show i ran a nail through the outside shell of one of the fingers and they are STILL waterproof."
1,Could have been great....,"After only 2 weeks of light use the inner liner tore, before that the glove was great. Wind proof kept the cold temp at work from getting in, and had great grip. The fit was a little snug, even after measuring the hand and ordering the correct size.I might order another pair, but still not sure."
3,Multi Purpose Glove with a few flaws,These gloves are warm enough and seem pretty wind and water proof so far. The palms seem tough but the backside fabric not so much. Things that should be improved are the that the liners are loose and when you pull your hands out; the liners pull out too making it hard to put the gloves back on without some work readjusting. Also the finger tips have extra fabric on the tips making it really hard to work on anything small; I had to remove them when hanging Christmas light hooks and adjusting the volume on a car stereo can even be tricky. I always wear an XL glove and the XL in this case fits me well.
2,"Quality may be good, but size is what makes this not buy","I was very eager to wear these, once revived and tried to push my hands, but could not help it. I ordered the small size based on the product page description, but I could not slip me hand completely in. A returned and ordered medium this time, thanks to Amazon.After trying very hard on medium size, I was still not able to move my fingers and could not band my palm at all. I have returned back this size too. I wish I could have use it, though like the quality of material used."
2,potentially great gloves,"The reason I say ""potentially"" is because I haven't been able to wear these gloves enough to know just how good they are. The first day that I wore them, the liner came out of one of the gloves when I was trying to take it off. Now, I cannot get the liner back inside the glove all the way."
1,I am not satisfied with these gloves,"Do not have that size. In both cases it twice, first to a small size, and the second time I had a big size. I use no clothes. I lost my money. The deficit came in second place. I am not satisfied with these gloves. Was a place that I live behind a very expensive anyway. Therefore can not send it back. Are you conscious that you have sent me another one free gloves size L maybe it would be good."
2,Not for people with ears that stick out!,"I ordered these to wear while working out. I thought the padded earpieces would be comfortable and would block out other sounds. I was so wrong! Not only do the earpieces not fit my ears snugly, but they also hurt. I think it's because my ears stick out pretty far; the shape of the pads and the contour of the ear hooks are incredibly uncomfortable. In addition, external sounds are very apparent even while music is playing in the earphones. I do not recommend this product."
1,poor,"There are two things I absolutely love about Bobby Vinton's music. First, listening, you realize you never have to go to the doctor to ask for qualudes againSecond and far more important, Vinton's music gave John Paul George and Ringo something to wipe the floor with. If younger people don't understand why ""She Loves You"" sounded so fresh and brilliant in 1964, take a listen to some of these tracks. The fab four really were hard rock, and Vinton's songs puts this in stark releif.I can understand why people sixty and older liked this music; it was another world, a very nieve one, so the appeal of this makes sense.But if you grew up on rock after the Beatles, or even if you listen to Elvis and Chuck Berry, this stuff just dies a slow death in mid play, and makes you want to do the same."
3,"Good, but not the originals.","This is a great collection of his hit songs, but they are not the original final cuts. They are likely rerecordings from a later date. Personally I'm going to go and look for the real ""mcCoy."" For those who have an ""ear"" for the exact sounds of those 50s & 60s hits we loved in our youth, you'll notice the difference. If you don't crave perfection, this CD will suffice. bougie62@hotmail.com"
5,Good Cooling without need of add-on back plane,"A very good Fan/Heat Sink for those who limit the weight load on the motherboard. This item has the bonus of not needing the replacement of the stock heat sink support (located underneath the motherboard). Not as quiet as an orb design, but I can't hear it through my antec P180 case anyways. I'm running an 104 watt CPU that this heat sink keeps well within the optimum operating temps."
4,This was a little bit better than the debut,"While I don't agree with the main reviewer that reviewed the album, I liked Youngstown's sophomore effort. I liked the album kicker ""Machine"" where the group's toughness matches with the song's tough hitting beat, the loud heavy metal-like guitars and keyboards! The group had matured a bit in the singing. I like the one Beatles-like song (Grow Old With Me) that's on here--they actually sound good on it. It's unfortunate that the group broke up because this album was the next level for them. For this to be their swan song is a complete shame."
1,Self-indulgent twaddle,"I totally agree with the reviews by Sebastian and Berthap. I have read other, much earlier Jane Green novels before and quite enjoyed them for what they are (enjoyable ""chick lit"" about love and friendship etc). This one was dreadful though. I had expected it to change perspectives between the different characters but it is all told from the point of view of one very unlikeable vain, superficial character. She is the type of woman I would want to shake (or avoid like the plague) if I met her in real life. I also thought the writing was very lazy, ie, repetitive, contradictory, full of cliches etc etc. I think that after this and Jemima J (which I didn't mind but certainly didn't like as much as other Jane Green books)I will be staying well clear of this writer.My recommendation for potential buyers - don't buy this book, check out writers Sheila O'Flanagan or Elizabeth Noble instead."
2,Not high on my list...,"I patiently waited for this book to be released, because if you've read other Jane Green books then you know she's worth waiting for...But- I must say I was disappointed. I felt like I was constantly waiting for something exciting or unexpected to happen to the characters. I found the series of events highly predictable and almost imaginationless...I think most lacking was a true climax to the story. I don't think this is Jane Green's best work, but if it is the first book of hers you've read don't let it stop you from reading more- I promise the rest are better."
5,Straightforward and Important,"All too often, books on finding meaning in life and at work are made complicated by an author's belief that the more complicated the presentation, the more meaningful the author's underlying message must be. Dr. Pattakos avoids that common mistake. ""Prisoners of Our Thoughts"" is written in a clear and accessible style. As a result, Viktor Frankl's core principles come alive for anyone seeking the deeper meaning of their own life and work. I highly recommend this well written book."
1,Shallow,"Expected deep insight and useful suggestions.Got a superficial overview,simply lightly reiterating what the actual book is about....with exercises to practice. Useless, in my opinion"
5,Nightstand Favorite,"At last, a comprehensive guide for leading not only a more meaningful life but one that is more fulfilling and that incorporates joy as well! Dr. Pattakos provides methods for letting go of nonproductive thinking habits that are not conducive to a healthy and fulfilling life. Through reflection and purposeful thinking, Dr. Pattakos shows us how we can bring about positive and powerful changes into our everyday lives. This book has become my new nightstand favorite! -- Pam Grieco, Elementary School Teacher"
4,My husband loves these,I got these for my husband. He does farming with them and likes them. They protect his hands from scraps and scratches.
4,Stitching not as well,"The stitching was weak and some parts degraded immediately, leaving small pinky nail sized holes in a couple places...but since it first degraded (within two weeks of opening package) it hasnt broke down any worse after thorough usage. good gloves, common warmth...semi-durable as described."
2,Youngstown Glove,"These gloves are not what I expected them to be, the description that I read about them said that they were built strong enough for heavy work, But they just dont hold up to the work we do here in WV, they had a defective tear in one of the fingers right out of the box and I didnt want to take the time to ship them back because it was cold and I needed a pair of gloves and couldnt work without gloves. They would probably be an OK glove for snowmobiling or atv riding or maybe even skiing but dont get them for work."
2,NOT good motorcycle gloves,I bought these to use while riding my motorcycle because the description said 100% windproof. Well this morning I had to ride my bike for about 40 miles in 32 degree (Fahrenheit) weather and my fingers absolutely froze! I even tried putting a leather shell glove over top of them and that cut down on the wind but my fingers were still very cold. I had to stop 4 times to take off the gloves and warm up my fingers. I will agree they feel very good and are quite comfortable but I definitely cannot recommend these for motorcycle riding in cold weather.
3,Initial impression less than overwhelming,"Just came in from the historic early winter snow here in Md. Outside temps are just around the freezing point. I did light snow clearing from shrubs and deck, cleaned and setup birdbath- about 30 minutes total outdoors interspersed with several visits back to the basement. My fingers were cold at the end of this - colder than I would have expected them to be after spending $30 for these. They did keep my hands absolutely dry, as they were immersed in water in the process of clearing the birdbath. But when doing the snow clearing and when holding items which had an ambient air temp, they chilled quickly. I would not depend upon these gloves to keep my hands warm in the outdoors for any extended length of time."
1,"Great gloves, they just didn't fit","These are really nice gloves, but they would not fit any men that tried them on. If they could get their hand in the glove, then the fingers on the gloves were way too long. Same for women that tried them on. I ordered a size L."
1,Completely unusable.,"I don't know about all y'all, but these gloves are the worst I've ever put on. The inner liner is not attached to the outer shell, causing movement between the two. But worst of all, the thumbs are WAY too short, created a cramped feeling in the thumb. Add to this the liner issue and they are completely unusable. I've never had issues with gloves and thumb length in the past, so I'm pretty sure it's not a genetic issue. Good luck."
1,Unfortunate Defect,"First time I tried to use the product was in the Rockaways trying to help in the recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy. Unfortunately I didn't try the gloves on beforehand and when I got out there I realized they had sewn a left handed inner liner into the right handed glove. I kid you not. I was in some guy's basement trying to shovel out moldy drywall and other garbage and I couldn't even get my gloves on. I finally cut out the liner so that I could use the gloves and ended up throwing them away after because I was so pissed. Now I can't even return them.I imagine this doesn't happen that often, and otherwise they were pretty decent gloves, but as you can imagine I was pretty unhappy about the situation."
1,worst gloves ever,"i am a truck driver in the flat bed field. I needed gloves that would provide me with warmth as well as durability, these gloves suck more than words can describe. they literally shredded after a week. waist of money and if you buy these gloves after reading this review then just die now."
2,No gain.....,"Very stranger approach. Did not gain what I had expected but suspect the writer approached this suspect in self-promoting interests . Minor White has a much deeper view of Zen in regards of seeing and appreciating nature with respect: Be still until nature accepts your presence, and when you walk away ( may this be with a painting, drawing or photographic image or just an imbedded memory ) know that all this happened with nature's permission."
2,What is point?,"When I started to read this book, I was enjoying it. I thought it was new view on life and art. As soon as I moved forward, I realize than nothing new was introduced, except book appearance (very inconvenient by the way). If you want to learn drawing and see world around you differently, better to take book ""The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" by Betty Edwards (brilliant book). If you looking for philosophy or meditation, I think you will find better books around. Also original pictures in the book do not impress.Update: Just want to add. Author wow to draw without looking at drawing. He provide as an example his pictures with a lot of details and good enough quality. He just forgot to mention to naive readers that he spent last 20 - 30 years in professional drawing. So he!!! can draw automatically without looking at the paper, because he was doing it for most of his life."
4,Fresh and Sunny,"I have a huge knitting library and have been knitting for decades. While this is definitely not a book that will become your newest knitting bible, it has such a fresh and sunny disposition that it's hard not to love it. The patterns show a wide range, and although there are plenty I will never make, I enjoy just seeing things like a knitted silk evening gown! On the more practical end, while there is certainly nothing new about a simple knit hoodie (even with nice waist shaping), knitting it in the fiber suggested in the book makes both the knitting and the wearing a treat. To me, it is the kind of knitting experience you get when you go to your favorite yarn store, see something really cute that you never would have thought of on your own, and walk away with a really happy purchase and really happy knitting vibes."
1,Greetings from Knit Cafe,There was one section TOTALLY MISSING FROM THE BOOK. This was NOT mentioned in the description or I wouldn't have purchased it. Luckily the pattern I wanted was in the book. I am very unsatisfied.
5,Another Gift,This trilogy is another hit for a Christmas gift. The book combines 3 of Goldsworthy's works. Convenient and practical for storage.
2,For Spencerian scholars only!,"If you want a readable description of Elizabethan Ireland this will be a frustrating book to choose. Just too disorganized , too old fashioned , too Anglo-centric. Also too over priced evenfor a used copy. If you see it in a thrift store for a dollar or so , get it, otherwise forget it."
4,"Good program, needs an editor","This program works. I am using it to work with my 10 yr old son, who has seen wonderful improvement in his reading ability over 3 months of use. From that standpoint, I would give this book 5 stars. However, in the beginning of the book, Dr. Furr states ""I quickly realized that I actually knew very little about English grammar."" and I have to agree. I recommend the program highly, but I had to overcome issues of confidence in it as I came across typographical errors, redundancy, punctuation errors and misspellings throughout the book. This is a well-designed approach to a serious problem and would have benefited greatly from an editor who could have given this book the professionalism it deserves."
2,This did not help my struggling reader.,"I bought this book with hopes of helping my son improve his reading. The premise of this book is basically to read and reread the same passage twice a day for a week. This really seemed to help my son at first but after several months I felt like his ability to read unfamiliar stuff was no better than before. This book would be a good addition to a reading program but it did not help my child with word attack skills at all. I also bought the reading material that they sell to go with the program and found it to be very disappointing. The company neuro reading sells the ""books"" which are really just pamphlets."
1,Not happy,"How the devil do you expect me to rate the disc when it never turned up? Not happy, not happy."
2,Poster,I just received this poster and it is what is described. What I don't like is the yellow markings along the left side. I know this is a cheek poster but come on this is just poor workmanship. That is why I gave it 2 stars.
1,Amazon rip off,Buyer beware Amazon is selling the *8* year old second edition. Call the publisher American Map 508-230-2112 to order the third edition (published 09/04). Local streets and data are far more accurate in their current edition. I'm greatly disappointed that Amazon continues to sell such outdated references. This review posted 051605.
1,"A good premise, but poorly executed.","The Abductors: Conspiracy, by Jonathan Frakes, is a story of alien infiltration and abduction with total conquest of Earth as the ultimate goal. Frakes had a good idea here and with a little more dedication to the project it could have turned out very well. I found the grammar to be clumsy in many places, not refering to dialog which can be attributed to the character's patterns of speech. The short chapters were extremely annoying to me. At one point near the end of the book, characters were issued AK-47s and two pages later, within the same mini-chapter, were firing M-16s. The only reason I can imagine that this book made it to print is that the publisher hoped it would succeed on Frakes' fame as an actor and director of Star Trek TV shows and theatrical movies. It certainly couldn't do so on merit. I like Frakes, but this work is too amateurish and not ready for prime time."
5,Reppin for Savannah,"I moved to Washington, DC from Savannah. I used to hang out with 'flauge alot, until he got paranoid and rich and moved to Richmond Hill. Then when he was out in front of Pure Pain, he got shot and when I heard about it I broke down. Anyway, he is one of my favorite rappers of all time. This is a wonderful CD if you like real southern rap. It's not filled with candy and sugar like Nelly, or anything like that. It's real, and it's hard."
4,The Happiness and Sadness Of Love,"I must say I was never a fan of old T.V. movies but I have seen a few. And with most T.V. movies of the 70s the picture quality is not that great in the beginning but smooths out as the film goes along. Patty Duke and Frank Michael Liu both do a great job in this film although the acting is not all that great it is still very watchable.One thing I really liked in this flick is that Anne Baxter tries to hold the two together, very sweet! The ending is a little twisted and not expected but sad all the same. As one Amazon customer suggested must watch movie. I hope this movie comes to DVD."
5,Authoritative Book on Dealing with Shame,"Dr. Steffen, a licensed clinical psychologist, is the author of this in-depth yet easy-to-understand book. Dr. Steffen begins by defining shame and identifying some of its sources. She discusses the effects of feelings of shame on different aspects of one's life. Finally, she offers some introspective exercises to help people work through and overcome shame to find peace and self-forgiveness. A good book to help people self-analyze their emotions."
3,Adequate and academic,"I'm glad I read this book, but it is often dry and academic and sometimes a chore to continue reading. The best points are good drawings, a table listing crows and ravens of the world, and especially the references to corvids in art, poetry and literature. Shortcomings are that the book fails to recount many of the amusing and fascinating actions of these clever birds, the interesting behaviors are scattered through the lengthy text, and the book could have been edited and organized better. The author really packs this book with lots of information, perhaps too much. For example, the author wrote that a colleague ""recalls vividly how the spirit of a good friend seemed to manifest itself in a crow ... Tony was struck by the crow's resemblance to his friend Fred Harvey, who had been gravely ill in Santa Fe ... his friend died the day the crow arrived"". Now that's information you won't find in ordinary bird books!"
2,Hard to Read,"I think the publisher wanted to keep the look of the print book by embedding the original font. The result is sentences stretched unnaturally across the digital page and too much space (leading) between the lines. Unattractive and difficult to read.Also, there is an option in Indesign where you can remove forced line breaks... Why don't the publishers insist that this gets done? It would eliminate the two-words-running-together issue."
4,It's the only one so far,"Well, let's see. I'm beginning my MBA soon and am transcribing this into my computer for a little advance preparation. There are questions that my sole 200-level accounting course has prepared me to answer; some of the questions are written so poorly that you have to assume information (albeit not important info normally); it was obviously written by different people as the questions will change format/wording from section to section; there should have been an additional editing as there are repeated questions and small typo errors; and there are no ""interactive and prescriptive electronic review modules"" as stated on the back cover - at least that's what the publisher has replied to my e-mail. I cannot determine if it will assist me in my studies or in preparing for the CMBA, but I believe it is filling my idle time with a worthwhile task. All things considered I believe the next edition will have to be improved."
1,waste of money... just take the test,I was a student with Western Governor's University. The contracted with a portion of the tests from the Certified MBA. This was not necessary.
3,Knights Templar,"A good book referencing the history of the Knights Templar, although boring reading at times. I found it to be a good book for those who are interested in this particular part of religious history."
5,More letters from Pemberly,"What a delight this book is! If you are familiar with Austin's other works besides Pride and Prejudice, you pick up on who the letters are addressed to. This book is like receiving letters from dear friends."
2,Not as I remembered it.,"In my teens I had this album and dug it a lot. This early Cd release sounds very harsh. Almost unlistenable. Although, there are a couple of good instrumentals that hint at the direction Blow By Blow took ... overall this is a weak record. Perhaps,if I had been able to find an affordable and respectably re-mastered version it would have been worth keeping."
2,jeff does dylan?,"This is one of Jeff's duller albums even though Jeff plays great, has a terrific band with Max Middleton on electric piano and Cozy Powell on drums and Rod Stewart-soundalike Bob Tench on vocals. The problem is the songs. Jeff hasn't quite got his technique for instrumentals perfected (that will arrive with Blow by Blow), so the ones here sound tentative and odd. Other songs seem like throwaways--including the guitar god's cover of a very minor Dylan song. Strangely, two of Jeff's best ever songs are here: the bizarrely titled Ice Cream Cakes (the lyrics are never the point on a Jeff record) that features spine-tingling interplay between Jeff and keyboardist Max, and the over-the-top almost Hendrexian Going Down, with some of the most mindblowing feedback drones ever waxed. The album's almost worth it for just those two songs, but then again they make you realize how much better the whole project could have been."
4,A Great Inside Account,"Macmillan's work is how history should be written -- sparse prose, great detail, and highly entertaining. Anyone seeking to understand the relationship between the United States and China needs to read this book."
2,Runs small for size ordered,If you need a normal men's medium... order a large. Ran extremely small. Never got to try on them being waterproof.
4,I don't know how these will work,"Purchased these for my son thinking he would be working in crawl spaces again, but he probably won't be doing that as much now so it will be difficult to rate this product. We will keep them and we did receive them quickly and on time. They seem to be of good quality and who doesn't need a good pair of gloves when shoveling snow?"
2,liner bunches up when fingers are removed,"The lining of these gloves comes out of the fingers when you remove your hand. When I tried to put them on again, it took me a couple of minutes to straighten everything out--NOT what I need when trying to get things done. Too bad, because the gloves are well-constructed and seemed like they'd be great. Donated after two wears."
4,check,"I put the order with xl and send to me m is not good because the prdut is ggod but I can to use ,cause is short"
2,TOO SMALL,I bought these gloves for my boyfriends work and his hands fit any medium glove good but these gloves barely fit MY HAND and my hand is very small. I thought they would stretch out a little but they didn't and are very uncomfortable to wear because of how tight they are. I ordered another pair but in a larger size which cost me twice as much and hopefully those will fit...
2,No Wiring diagrams,"I bought the book in hope of obtaining wiring diagrams, this book offers none...I will use it for the 4x4 information though..Have always been disappointed with Chilton's repair manuals. I seldom ever used them before especially if there was a motors manual near by..."
5,Another great volume from LOA,"H.P. Lovecraft is perhaps the most influential writer of macabre tales of the 20th century, with writers such as Stephen King singing praises of his elaborate Cthulhu Mythos and other tales. Though not a complete compendium of Lovecraft's work, Library of America has compiled 850 pages of his most seminal and eerie prose. Arranged in a chronological order, this Tales volume allows the reader to track Lovecraft's evolution as a writer from the overwrought grotesqueness of ""Herbert West"" to the bone-chilling ""The Call of Cthulhu."" This book makes a great jumping-off point for one to immerse themselves in the world of Lovecraftian horror. If you enjoy this volume, try tracking down some of his more obscure works!"
4,Classic Lovecraft,"Even though this edition of Lovecraft's tales is very good, I feel it should have included more stories and maybe essays that he wrote."
4,Hardcover H.P. Lovecraft.,"I bought this book to replace the old and tattered paperbacks I had taking up space. I won't go into the stories; others have done that.The only things I can complain about is the thin paper of the pages that let you almost see the text from the page on the other side, and the fact that the book itself is small. I was expecting a hardcover to be somewhat more of a tome; this book is not. (However it would be a good book to sling into your backpack)On the plus side; the type is a good size on white paper so reading will not strain the eyes. The binding is pretty solid and the glossy black dust jacket screams class in a very understated way. And the price is right!"
4,Lovin' Lovecraft,"Great stories, cheap, neat little bookmark thing...The problem?Minor as it may be, the pages and binding are awfully thin to the point that the bible pages seem as thick as a pop-up book and you end up spending most of the time that would be spend reading on making sure you don't rip the pages as you turn them. This might not be a problem if I didn't have such sweaty fingers that ruin such ridiculously thin pages but, I do and as such I have to give it only a 4 out of 5."
1,Info Sys & Comp App CLEP,I agree with many readers about this book. It has nothing but exam questions that seemingly doesn't even relate to the named content. The only useful tool was the glossary. I borrowed the book from the library and thought it was a definite waste of my time.
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money!,"This book is the worst thing I have EVER ordered online. It is badly copied pages, comb-bound. It actually looks like it was typed on a manual typewriter - not very confidence inspiring for a computer study guide. The material is out of date. The additional recommended reading list did not have a book newer than 1989!!! It is just page after page of practice tests, which again are very dated. Don't waste your money."
2,kinda boring,"A collection of short pieces written by a man who knows his subject very well.I thought I was going to be captivated. But most of the vignettes are kinda boring: so-and-so's opposite number in the Wehrmacht was actually his cousin, this guy and this other guy actually met at a dinner before becoming mortal enemies, if this or that operation had succeeded, it would have brought the war to a halt, etc.It ended up being something of a chore to finish."
2,There are better shower albums out there!,"I bought this album for my best friend's baby shower and overall, I was really disappointed with it. The one thing I do like is the front cover - a really cute design and a place to put a picture of the mom-to-be or the baby. Otherwise, it is very underwhelming. The pages are relatively small (you could fit one 4x6 picture on a page) and so there isn't a lot of room for pasting bits of the napkins, ribbons, etc. Also, the invitation I used would definately not fit on the page dedicated to the invitation. There are pages for all the basic information (the scene, menu, guest list, baby gifts, crystal ball- prediction for baby, advice pages, wisdom from the grandparents, shower fun and games, shower keepsakes, and photos), but it was totally uninspiring.I got another shower album from Hallmark (the one with the sun on the front) and liked it a lot better - it even had a page dedicated to the wrapping paper from baby's presents (which this one didn't!)."
4,Great Baby Shower Gift,I bought this for my daughter-in-law's baby shower.It's very cute and is formatted nicely for recording a very special event.We put a picture of the sonogram on front cover.We also layed the album open on table for guests to sign during the shower...
1,Did not last,I ordered/installed this pump in November and in March I had to have it replaced. Not the quality I would expect from Bosch.
2,Mediocre chewing gum,"I bought this gum thinking it would kill two birds with one stone: that the chewing would help my ears pop during flights and that the ginger would minimize the chance of air sickness.An individual piece of this gum is so tiny that chewing it doesn't really move your jaws or pop your ears. Either chew two or three pieces simultaneously, or just buy a pack of Bubblicious at the grocery store before your flight instead.As far as the ginger, yes, the gum is better than airplane ginger ale that uses fake ginger flavoring. However, the gum shell is kind of hard and the ginger flavor just seems a little bit off. Not sure if there's enough ginger to affect your tummy.Fyi--this is actually the identical product as the Sea-band anti-nausea gum that's sold under a couple different names via Amazon (same packaging and everything).It was worth a shot. I'll finish the package. But I doubt I would buy it again."
2,not for denture wearers,"I bought this gum for my Mom last year. She had uterine cancer. She said it helped a little bit with the nausea but she could only chew for a few minutes and then she spit out. She had dentures. I never thought about that so I wanted to just warn everyone if you are buying this for an elderly person and they have dentures don't. Also, if they have advanced cancer like my mother did, I don't think any gum will help that much. I think you'd be better off buying some ginger cookies or ginger candy or even fresh ginger for them to nibble on or steep in tea."
4,works for me,"I've suffered from motion sickness as far back as I can remember. For years I have taken ginger root capsules before any trip longer than 20 min if someone else is driving. I saw these in a pharmacy last year (it seems they are no longer available locally) and decided to give them a try. They work for me. Also, my younger child suffers from motion sickness. He can't swallow capsules yet, but this gum works for him. It does have a strong, spicy flavor, (having some water at hand helps) but it goes away in a few minutes of chewing. My son asks for it because it works."
5,Marty Robbins Greatest Hits,I love this CD. It brings back very fond memories of my childhood when my mom used to wake us up with Marty Robbins songs. I love it!
5,The GREAT Marty Robbins,What can I say..I have been a Marty Robbins fan for many years and as far as I am concerned any song he sang was perfect.So sorry that he is gone. Miss him always..What a voice!
5,great book,"I like this book, has some nice pentatonic ideas you can use in all styles of music. I'm learning a lot from just one week of going through the book."
4,Great Addition to Any Music System,"This is such a simple way to get all the music you want on to an old music system. I've had my stereo since they were called stereos (and it had a actual turntable connected once). Since every song I like is on my Nano - and not all are on CD's, I wanted to hear them at home and not just directly in my ears. I tried just wiring the Nano into the inputs, but that was useless. This dock let me play the songs and the remote is great. I've since had to replace the old stereo and the dock is now the centerpiece of the system."
3,"Fitz Lives! and Dies, and Lives,.....","This book was an easy read; it had a good history of the Alaskan regions and dogsledding. I could picture Roger Daltrey in this book,(heavy Fitz involvement) and character imagery is important for a Highlander book. I had problems with phrases being repeated, and the predictable ending, but overall, it was worth reading. Good for a hot day in August!"
1,No instructions and does not fit!,"This seems like a fine filter but there were no installation instructions, no adapters and no specifications saying what type of threads the diverter valve requires. So, I have to drag it down to the hardware store and hope I find someone with half a brain that knows which adapter will work. Also, there are no help pages or instructions on the Purenex site to download.I am not impressed....So much for ordering something on-line and saving hassles and time.DP"
3,Not as pictured/not what expected,The product is not the same one that's pictured. If you are looking for something that filters out anything more than chlorine and some sediment this is not for you. The only thing it does is reduce chlorine slightly. It also seemed low quality/cheap and had a strange industrial smell to the filter. The tap where water comes out continues to release water after the tap is shut off. This means it slowly drains water on your counter.
3,"To much of this, not enough of that","Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles / Live!(single CD - 6 songs): I like this album but it is a frustrating album. These live tracks seem out of context with each other, as if there's something more going on that isn't being shared with us. The tracks on the album are fine, sometimes challenging (that is what we have come to expect from Santana) but this album seems horribly incomplete. Not knowing why they didn't make a 2 LP concert out of this (and not knowing what was left out) it is hard to say what kind of editing was needed, but it certainly needed something more (or less) done to it. One gets the feeling, listening to this album, that you are at the concert, but you're passing out on every other song. Not enough to give it four stars, but there are still some good stuff in it."
2,Not as good as I heard it was,"I heard a lot about this album but when I heard it for the first time only recently, I was very disappointed. No wonder Jimi ditched Miles. Santana's later concerts were of far greater quality. Take for example his 24min jam with Clapton on ""Eyesight to the Blind"" or even his ""Scareed Fire"" album. Useless hype for a mediocre performance. Maybe worth listening to for historical purposes but definitely not worth buying."
2,disappointed.,"I was looking for something to help me teach a design class to high school students, and have found this author's work helpful many times in the past. This book was disappointing and not particularly useful for high school students or to designers."
4,great for beginners,This book is a great help for me since this is my 1st year at theater stage design
2,NOTHING WORTH STAYING AFTER SCHOOL FOR.,"AFTER SCHOOL IS THE STORY OF A STUDENT-TEACHER RELATIONSHIP. FATHER MCCARREN ( SAM BOTTOMS) IS A YOUNG PROFESSOR. SEPTEMBER JOHNSON (RENEE COLEMAN) IS HIS TOP STUDENT. THEY DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP BUT IT IS NOT PHYSICAL. THE MOST THEY DO IS KISS. DO NOT BE FOOLED THINKING YOU ARE GETTING A SEX FILLED COMEDY. (ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD OF MADE IT MUCH BETTER). IT IS DEALING MORE WITH FATHER MCCARENS DECISION TO STAY TRUE TO HIS VOWS AS A PRIEST OR JUST BE A REGULAR MAN. ALSO THERE ARE SCENES THAT FLASH BACK TO CAVEMAN TIMES THAT REALLY TAKE AWAY FROM THE MOVIE. NOT THAT THERE IS MUCH TO TAKE. THIS IS NOT THE WORST MOVIE EVER, ALTHOUGH MY REVIEW MAY SEEM THAT WAY, IT WAS JUST VERY SLOW AND NEVER REALLY TOOK OFF. I WAS EXPECTING SO MUCH MORE AND WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I DID NOT GET IT."
1,Showcase,"This is an excellent showcase revealing attempts by elected representatives to appear as intelligent seekers of truth....and failing. But putting government employees to the pillory is popular in some circles and, well, that's ShowBiz"
