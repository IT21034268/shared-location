3,"Glass is nice, but leaky lids are a problem!","We love our Pyrex set because the glass is durable and doesn't absorb food odors or stains from tomato-based products. BUT, if you're looking for containers to transport your lunch to work or to take food to a party, look elsewhere unless you can guarantee that the container won't be jostled or tipped in any way. We were spoiled by our plastic Rubbermaid containers, which were perfectly water-tight, but with these, my lunch bag is a mess by the time I get to work, as the lids simply don't seal well enough. They're great for items that will go from the stove to the fridge for leftovers, but they don't cut it otherwise."
2,Cheap lids on new model,"I bought a set of these containers at Bed, Bath and Beyond a few months ago. They were excellent quality, sealed well, heavy lids.The set I just bought via Amazon have very flimsy lids that don't seal well and are the weak link in an otherwise good product. When these crack in a couple months, the whole set will have to be replaced.It really gives me the feeling that this company created a good product, attracted customers, then let us down by trying to squeeze out a few extra pennies of profit. Shame on you. I will not buy these again online."
3,Does what it saids.,"14 pieces means 7 containers and 7 lids. So don't be mislead to think you are getting 14 containers. Also the packaging is so so, one of my container arrived chipped."
3,Eh . . .,"I love pyrex for the microwave, and this set was a good deal at 19.99, but they would be better ifa) the small ones were stackable, andb) the lids were glass.The lids are sort of hard to get on and off, and have all the issues of plastic in the microwave.I have some older pyrex bowls of a similar size with glass lids with little grabbable handles on the side that I just love.Wish they still made those, they are perfect."
5,"A play for children, this will strike anyone","I've read and have directed this wonderful play by Aurand Harris. It's the classic tale of a little girl who is forced to accept her grandfather's death. However, she learns a valuable lesson when she runs into the woods and meets a dancing bear. The bear's life also seems to be running out of time, but he resolves to teach his dances to a ""little bear"" so that a part of him will live on. The little girl realizes the lesson and learns that her grandfather has left a little of himself with her. A great read and a wonderful way for children to learn about the immortality of man."
2,"Wha? Yeah, HoI is wayyyyyyyy better.","This game is knock off of Hearts of Iron. Only it's turn based and not done as well. In that way, it's basically a Civilization IV scenario, but not as cool looking as a Civ 4 scenario would be.Anyone who has played Hearts of Iron for 3 seconds will appreciate just how superior it is to anything this game tries to do. Most people complain Paradox games are just too complicated, no, they just like to get things right. It's display by tons of research.For instance, being able to have Rommel as my tank commander for Germany. Researching U-boats. Or triggered events.Not only that, but Storm is just clunky. HoI is done way better, flows naturally, and is completely open ended with so many more deployable units.I just don't understand rating this a 4/5 star game??? Forget that it doesn't do a good job with WWII as a subject, it's not a good turn based game (compared to other successful ones, say Civ IV) and it's not a good strategy game at all."
1,Big Scream TV: The Boo Tube! Volume 1,"Glad I did not pay full retail for these products, the previews looked pretty good but when you actually get the product the majority of it is pretty lame. Unless you like dumb and stupid I would not recommend these Big Scream products."
3,Su tamaño es reducido,"El tamaño es reducido considerablemente, aun mas alla de que se expresan bien sus medidas da la sensacion de ser mas pequeño d elo ofertado aun asi el producto es de buena calidad"
4,Good case but expensive...,"This is a good case by itself but Walmart provides some better and cheaper (almost 1/3rd the price) options. I would certainly recommend a trip to walmart before buying this so called ""OEM"" case online."
3,Great toy for boys,"I must admit, this toy is not durable for our 5 year old boy. The ends of the wings fell off, the cockpit hatch keeps falling off, when dropped, the nose cone has fallen off multiple times; however, my boys love this toy as much if not more than any toy they have. It is very large and they have so much fun flying it through the house. Our 2 1/2 year old is getting one for Christmas so that my two boys don't fight over it anymore. I have looked and looked for other toy planes this large and can't find one. So, I would recommend it for any family of boys as long as they are the kind that would rather play with imagination than perfection."
5,Really Great Knife,I got this knife for my college roommate's wedding gift. It was a really nice knife. A friend of mine recommended Buck and I can see why. This knife was really great and appeared to be built very well. The handle of the knife I bought was a little lighter than the picture and the sheath is a very light tan. It is a very beautiful knife. I would recommend it.
3,Action filled,"This is an entertaining novel, full of action. While there are not many twists to the story, it is a quite enjoyable read. Wolverine fans will like this one. The portrayal of Logan is true to the comics. The story moves at a fast pace and it is a quick read, I finished it on a flight from the East Coast to L.A."
4,fun,I almost felt guilty that I had so much fun reading this book. I read it in one day--couldn't put it down. I felt like I was spying on someone (and something) that I wasn't supposed to know about. Highly entertaining.
1,Kind of ho-hummmmm,"While there are some amusing bits in this book, I would not give it more than one star. This lady may be a great beauty editor (I am a subscriber to Lucky mag) but she is hardly a stellar author. So much of this rings false...come on, she wears a designer dress revealing her boobs to a FiFi Awards show and ""forgets"" she's been nominated and is ""shocked"" when she wins and has to accept under the lights? Puh-leeze! A lot of the book is the same kind of self-deprecating (but secret look at me) kind of writing. But since I got this at Bath&Body at 90% off the original price, it's not too bad."
2,Bad,Does not deserve to be in with the original Crow Movie. Storyline is crappy and the acting is poor. The City of Angels only redeeming feature is it had decent actors in it. Wicked Prayer was just flat horrible. I wound up tossing this after watching the video.
3,Buttons are already hanging,"This looks good, but buttons are not strictced properly. Other than this, this looks good"
3,Good and entertaining but little disappointing,"The Infinities line of Star Wars plays as a What If? storyline of the original trilogy of the saga. In this third installment, which I thought was one of the better ones, came a little short of being great, in fact the three books come out this way. In Jedi, it is very interesting to see how things would've played out if something different had happened. It was good to see this, but one of our favorite characters is sort of incapacitated, and the ending wasn't that good either. Also to note is that I thought the three books would be tied together storywise but no they are stand alone stories, a bit disappointing, but in general it was good and entertaining."
5,FULL OF WIN!,"We just bought one for my niece, but my daughter still has hers, six and a half years later. For a baby, so good to chew on, grab on, crawl after, run after, its uses grow. Its so soft you can toss it to a baby. My daughter still has hers in her bed."
2,"Booty bounce shake, move that thang to the side music","I first heard slip n slide a couple years ago at a club in FLorida. The beat sounds just like a more well known ""banned in the usa"" artist from back in the day. But the thing is when I heard the rest of the record. All of there songs sound like his. Yes it is that ""booty"" base music, and you may think all of it sounds the same anyway, but they truly bit his style and lyrics. They have a song called ""ride"" which sounds like his ""scarred"" just to name 1. But overall they did play it at the clubs and you can't help but to dance to it."
3,A Worthwhile CD,"Victor Feldman started his jazz career as a seven-year-old drummer, then added vibes and piano. By 20, he was leading his own bands, and amazingly for a British jazz musician, was recruited to a US band (he later worked for Miles Davis for a while). This is largely small-band work with Feldman on vibes, along with two pieces for a medium-sized band, with him on drums. Mostly good stuff, it's well worth a listen."
2,good but,"Good book on deal structure, but if you want a valuation number, check out ""Unlocking the Value of Your Business""."
5,"Great price, great product!","Does what it promises...creamy froth in seconds!Excellent build quality, and has a great stand too. Highly recommended!"
4,"Aerolatte Stainless-Steel Deluxe Edition Frother with Stand, Chrome","Attractive design. Easy to change batteries, easy to clean. Not as powerful as I thought it would be. Slows way down when used deep in cup. Best used near top of cup to catch the air. I tried to use it with non-fat coffee creamer, but bubbles disappear. Wife uses non-fat milk and it works great; she loves it."
1,Aerolatte Deluxe Edition with Stand vs Portable,"I ordered the Aerolatte Stainless-Steel DELUXE Edition Frother with Stand (Chrome) in order to haveit standing handily by my Expresso machine. I had the portable version. The new one has 1/3 thepower that the old portable version has and so it has become almost useless to me.Aerolatte 1 Stainless-Steel Deluxe Edition Frother with Stand, Chrome"
3,Does not live up to billing,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this has been a bit of a disappointment. Skim won't froth period, 2% will froth if cold, and whole will froth if it is tepid. If you are using this for something besides frothing milk for espresso, etc., this it might be o.k., but that is the lone reason for me for this purchase. I will be looking into an actual frother. Harder to clean up, etc., but botom line I need something that works, and this comes up just a little short."
3,Not the best way to froth your milk.,"I love the design and i really wanted to keep it since it seems to be very easy to use. But my luck was not constant - i use 1% milk and even when it's cold, the foam is not as good as it should be. And even if i get any, it would disappear in a matter of seconds.I used to have a Bojure milk frother and i had amazing rezults - not only i could use even half and half and get a nice foam, i use warm up it and sometimes i was able to get foam good enough for latte art.Very disappointed that i had to return it and start my search again."
3,Herirtices of Dune.,I have enjoyed the books fo the Dune series for years and finally have the full set.
5,complex craftmanship,"This is a complex book, with an intricate plot, a maze of well-developed characters, and descriptions wrought by a mature master of his craft in full command of his powers. At the detail level, Heretics of Dune is a better book than Dune itself, though it doesn't quite match the youthful energy of the earlier work. Nevertheless, this is a must-read!"
3,Not my favorite,"Even though heretics was not my favorite it is worth the read, especially if you wish to understand the remainer of the series written by his son Brian Herbert."
5,Olympus best mid level lens for 4/3 system,"This lens is simply a must have for landscape work. Optically it is better than the 14-54 and 50-200 that completes olympus mid-end pro glass. Focus is silent and fast. Only wish it could be wider as the 2x crop factor makes it a 22-44mm in 35mm terms, 90 degree FOV. For architecture I would recommend the 7-14mm, but at $700 it is still a best buy."
1,Very poor sequal to Carnage in New York,"I did not like this book at all. The apperance of the Green Goblin did little for the story and Carnage pretty much does the same thing he did in the first novel, which is try to kill Spider-Man. Carnage in New York was a much better book then this. Don't bother with Goblin's Revenge."
3,"eh,cool","im not really a big fan of mike patton really the only time i liked him was with dillinger escape plan but then i heard songs like rosemary's baby and experiment in terror and decided to check this band out.Unlike his other bands this doesn't have any crap like rap or hip hop right?His vocals are awesome well only when he screams cause im more into that but the other singing is cool too not into the jazz thing tough,so check this out you will probably like it i mostly just listen to rosemary's baby and the other few songs."
3,Rosemary's other baby,"... This is about as arty as (heavy) art-rock gets: a supergroup plays moody speed-metal interpretations of soundtrack themes. And they do it well. Instead of turning each song into a predictable overblown heavy metal song, they play it like it's a big inside joke.Which is fun. You've probably never heard half of these songs in their original forms (and you can hardly recognize the rest) but that doesn't matter. This album lives up to the reputations of all the musicians involved."
3,"Daughter loved it, but it's falling apart","We never put the batteries in this doll, so I can't comment on it's swimming ability. My daughter loved it to pieces, however, and played with it in the tub several times a week. She also loved the book that came with it. However, a few months after we bought it, the rubber on the tail started to rip. Last week, the ""skin"" on the tail came off completely. My daughter is really sad. She still plays with it, but always comments on her broken tail."
1,a little cheese with your whine?,"Whiny main character - oh no, she doesn't get a part in the play! Not a likable character at all. An excerpt is in our class anthology - students were bored and uninterested."
2,So-so,"This book is decent for diagnosing narcissitic traits, but it doesn't really give much advise on dealing with it."
3,Life's too short,"This book does an admirable job of validating what anyone who's been in close consort with someone with NPD already knows. It's also laugh-out-loud funny! It describes scenarios that the ""experienced"" will recognize immediately. Then it tells us how to 'cope'; how to create and don emotional insulation, etc. The question then becomes, ""Why would anyone want to do this?"" Life's about choices. If you're trying to come to a ""decision"" about remaining in a relationship with a narcissist, then this book will let you know what you'll have to do to try to keep some sanity! It gives no ""advice"" but, having been there, I will - ""run like hell and never look back""."
1,But why would you?,"Although I gave ""Children of the Self Absorbed"" high marks, I feel Nina Brown has made a grave error in writing this book.There is no way to a have a mutually satisfying relationship with a partner who has narcissistic personality disorder. These ""people"" are void of empathy and are the center of their own universe. You are nothing more than supply to them, you are there to serve their egos. If you take Brown's advise here and stop ""feeding "" them, they move on to a new victim. They can not love anyone and will not love you. I suppose if this is what you're looking for and you don't mind being an object, not a person, go for it. I just can't imagine why anyone who knows the insidious nature of narcissism, would ever want to teach you how to have a relationship with one. Narcissists are abusers and you need to remove yourself from their grasp, not learn how to live within it."
4,"Some great original songs, It's definitely different","There are some beautiful songs here that you will probably never hear on any radio station, they are worth the buy. Did not like the remakes of Clint's songs. Loved the remake of a song I remember from Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"". Very whimsical. It always cheers me up. Track number 10 is a gem of my life."
3,Good Mellow Music,"Well, this CD isn't too bad but is kind of inconsistant. The flow is erratic from song to song. I do like this CD better than most country music these days but I still would prefer Clint's oldest music (his first 3 albums).The best songs are: Been There, When I said I Do, Hand In The Fire, Love She Can't Live Without and Who I Use To Be. These songs are good and sound like the kind you would like to listen to to relax (Been There is kicking!). The other songs leave something to be desired. Bob Away My Blues, Galaxy Song, Dixie Lullaby and the two remakes of his older stuff (Burn One Down & No Time To Kill) are boring.I recommend this CD though as the good songs outweigh the bad and over all it is about a 3.5 on my rating scale."
1,Not a Country Music CD,"I was extremely disappointed with this CD. Contrary to other reviews, I found his experimentation with ""new"" styles disasterous. His voice, normally powerful and soulful, is hollow and weak and his accompanying music shallow. I was hoping for accoustic, unplugged music capable of showcasing his vocal talent, and found--instead--a superficial, sugary-sweet label induced CD marked by undercharged performances. For fans who appreciate Black's country talent, this CD belongs in the local used CD store (where mine is headed after I finish this review), not in your collection."
5,Most impressed with this CD,"I bought this CD because of the beautiful duet ""When I said I Do"" that he does with his wife, Lisa Hartman Black. I quickly loved the diversity of this CD-- it is not the traditional country album, but MUCH better! I quickly fell in love with the ""Galaxy song"" as well as the single ""Love she can't live without"". I am impressed these beautiful songs were produced without electric instruments-- they are all so beautiful, you don't even miss them! This is a must buy!"
3,Pretty Big,"its pretty kool cd, the lyrics are good and the beats are nice, just listen to the samples and judge for yo self"
3,A book with a minor heartbeat.,This was the 1st Brent book that I acutally cared about the main character. I cared what happened to her - but the things that did happen in this book were very forced and very predictable. That made reading this book difficult - it's not really longer than a short story but took me several sittings to get though. Average.
3,"Good, but not great","I've been played about all of the Star Wars sims games, but this one just isn't my favorite. Yes it does have absolutly great graphics, nice original music mix, and force feedback support (yay). But I found some of the mission designs to be just not credible, and the storline was definatly lacking. They didn't even finish it! Also, the big ""Death-Star"" battle in the end wasn't very good."
1,Physical Chemistry... not bad but not good either....,"Thomas Engel's Physical Chemistry is a book full of mistakes as well as stupid problems... The Quantum chemistry part is horribly explained(about 10 chapters). Which makes me think... perhaps the author can not explain the material because he does not understand it. Engel take some more quantum classes or repeat them, and then write a book about a subject you have not mastered. I want my money back."
2,"2 Red Hens Whole Roost Bag, I would not buy another!","The first impression of the bag is nice, seems to be good materials and a nice design with great features. Then you start using it and realize that all the stitching holding the straps/handle on come apart and unravel very easily. They need to take another look at finding a better method for attaching the straps to this bag because the current construction method is very bad. I did not have the bag long enough to test the durability of the rest of it, as soon as the straps started coming off I returned it to Amazon. I only had the bag for a total of 4 days. I am still waiting for my money to be refunded but so far Amazon as a whole has been great, unfortunately with this bag you just don't get what you paid for. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1 is for design, and because I can't say the rest of the bag is faulty since I did not keep it long enough to test that.I hope this helps in the decision making."
1,Where has Brookner been for the last century?,"While I have enjoyed many of her books, this was astonishingly poorly written and sappy. She cannot decide which of her unattractive, uninteresting, self-absorbed characters to concentrate on. She is writing about modern people in present-day England, but it may as well be Victorian times; the notion that passionate sex (not true passion) will be punished through the death of the innocent (though obnoxious) spouse of the main character and their unborn child. It all has been done before--long, long before, when it would have fit the age--and much more competently. I will be wary of my next book by Ms. Brookner."
5,After 60 years both sides are told for the last great Sea battle,To read both the American and Japanese with the full view of 60 years of released documents is aspect of this very balanced book.Evan Thomas writting abilities adds to these insights and makes this book a joy for WWII History buffs to read and re-read.
2,mislead by imus,"Picked up book based on imus's recommendation. He couldn't have read this entire book as he claims. Lifeless battle scenes,confusing geography,poor overall context makes this a disappointing read.Other than superficial insight into the Japanese military mind-set the book left me frustrated as the premise was so promising."
2,Grave disappointment,"One would hope that the journalistic skills of Mr. Thomas would be evident in this book. Sadly, it is little more than a compilation of notes scarcely held together with some biographical threads. It fails to capture the drama of the events, and gives the impression that the author took a trip, read of the events, made some notes, and decided perhaps there was some money to be made by packing it all up in a book. In the latter regard, he seems to have been right, but it is not attributable to either historical or literary quality. Furthermore, the maps are poor, fail to contain many of the details referred to in the text, and are inadequate. There are many other accounts of these events that are more accurate, engaging, and literate. Maybe this is why there are so many ""used"" copies of Mr. Thomas's book available."
4,good study of commanders minds,"This history book is a well written and carefully researched study of how the particular personality and mind set of various military commanders affected the outcome of various sea battles in WWII. It also confirms how following (or not following) the chain of military command contributed to these same results. I believe the author could have made better use of the too few diagrams. In particular, I was somewhat unable to follow all the events leading up to the sinking of the USS Johnson. Perhaps the author should have located these diagrams better with the narrative. Otherwise, I found this a worthwhile addition to my understanding of several major battles in the war."
1,I got taken,I was under the impression that this order was for 1 box of 4 quaker oats for $14.99. It turns out that it is only one box of quaker oats for $14.99. I have ordered this before and have gotten the 4 boxes. I now learn that they reduced the price to $8.99 for the one box. I really feel cheated and would not trust this company again. Sally Thayer
1,Just forget this software,"Software is ok, but don't believe in the rebates. It has been over 4 months now and 3 calls to their company and they have promised me over and over again that they had an ""overwhelming response"" and that it will come in 2 weeks. Now, 4 months after sending the rebate in, the status shows as processing on their web site. Poor company, unethical way of treating their customers."
5,Love it!!!!!!,I'm a huge fan of Zomtek Productions and I am so glad they finally made a dvd of one of their movies. As with their other projects this is also hilarious. Can't get enough!!! I hope they keep this up!!!
5,Packed full!,I received this book in great condition and in just about a weeks time. This book is packed full of information that I've never heard of before. I rigorously research different herbs daily so you can imagine how pleased this book has made me.
5,This tape shows how rap is supposed to be made.,"If you like Bay Area rap then this is the tape to get. Messy Marv and San Quinn are the tightest rappers in the bay. They are the ones who will keep San Francisco on the map in the rap industry. This is a tape you can roll to, mob to or get pumped to, it is the total package. If you like rap there is no way you can go wrong with the best rappers in the bay."
3,I Expected a Bit More,"I loved Messy Marv and San Quinn's contributions to the 17 Reasons Compilation, but this album did not quite reach my expectations, which may have been too high. I did not find the production too great, so their delivery was a bit watered down. These are two great rappers, so you might want to pick this up to witness their talent, but I'd rather listen to their other releases or compilations."
5,An amazing CD with an amazing story behind it.,"This is a cd that remains, while others come and go, in my cd changer. Having seen the two play Four Hand Piano at Disneyland many, MANY times, I bought the CD the day it came out and have listened to it more than any of my others I think. Amazing renditions of both classic ragtime tunes and popular music from the 20's (Black Bottom/ Charleston) to the 60's (Alleycat) But this CD and watch your friends get their copies :)"
2,PRICE IS TOO HIGH FOR A SINGLE BOWL,"Don't buy this item from Amazon. The price would have been reasonable for a package of two or three, even four. Imagine my surprise to open the shipment and find ONE bowl! These Pyrex bowls are my preferred kitchen storage, but I won't be buying them from Amazon again."
4,Easy to install - slightly quieter than my old Nutone fan,"This fan is actually cheaper than the previous Nutone ceiling fan that I installed 25 years ago in the kitchen above the stove. Installation is simple if you have easy access to the attic and possess some basic knowledge of electrical connections. I expected it to be significantly quiter than the old Nutone ""airplane propeller."" It is, but only slightly.Still, I recommend it. The fan does the job, and the price is right."
3,Works until broken,"I loved this product until it broke! I had only used it for about 3 months when the seal came off...that was fine actually, it just leaked more, but I still used it. However, when I arrived at my destination and looked through the plastic, I discovered that I'd lost about a third of my coffee! So confused, until I realized that the inner platic layer had cracked, and the coffee was now in the air space in-between the layers. Since this made it nearly impossible to get out the coffee, and it started to rot as I pondered what to do, I had to pitch the entire thing."
3,"Tastes great, if you don't mind","having to press it twice to get all the grounds out. I use the coursest grounds my burr grinder can make, but every time I make a cup of coffee I have to press it, remove the lid and get all the grounds off the filter, then press it again. I still get some grounds after that, but not as bad. Also, after only a few months of use the seal has stopped working so I can't use this as a travel mug anymore. I'll probably buy one of the Bodum Chambord coffee presses and a thermos."
4,Can Finally Drink Coffee Again,"Drank coffee for years - all of a sudden it started to bother my stomach. Boy did I miss my morning Joe until I found out about French Press brewing. I can now drink coffee without the oil that irritates my stomach. With this travel French Press, I can have coffee in the office also. Love this product; wish it kept the coffee hot longer."
5,Great cable,"This is the third spool I have purchased, and I have no complaints. It's 1000 feet of 18 gauge stranded copper wire, 2 color for correct polarity matching."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS FLOAM,"I was expecting something like Floam, but this is much drier and harder to sculpt with. I prefer the real Floam!"
3,Hmmmmm,"My daughter seems to love this stuff, but the foam pellets do separate out and it's hard to pick them up. It's kind of like having tiny styrofoam ""peanuts"" all over your house. We were given a brick as a present and I'm glad, because now I know I don't like it enough to buy it."
3,Not an Integrated Approach,"Although the book covers several introductory themes about the supply chain management, there is a lack of integration inside the book. The book contains several footnotes to different articles and books. It made me feel that the book was written in a somehow assembly manner."
2,Review of Tamagotchi Egg : Useless Advice for the Shell,"This book lives up to its' title in full. There is nothing in this book that could be useful. It does have a Tamagotchi name section, but they are all spelled wrong. It is a waste of a reader's time. I would not recommend it to any one."
2,Jamming,They keep jamming on me and shooting two nails at once then they both get stuck in there and im spending more time trying to fix them and having guys standing waiting or they are fixing them so spend money on them im not happy
3,Lightweight but has nail issues,"We bought this for a home construction project. While we really like how lightweight it is, we had problems with the nails. They have been a bane to our existance since the gun frequently jams up and you have to stop in the middle of your project and unplug it to continue. While that wouldn't be a big deal if you are working on a small project, it is a bummer when you are trying to work at a steady pace on a large construction job."
5,Good mix between theory and practice,"I was looking for a hands on book. It is a pity I had to buy also the software ""The Investment Portfolio"" which should be included, and also I missed the answers to chapter problems. After a couple of weeks I feel I could advise in making and managing a portfolio."
2,Mostly nonsense,"Corporate America does not endorse the customer having control of their experience. However, public schooling does give the power to the children. Power which, incidentally, neither the children or mentally sound adults want them to have. It's pleasant to take the 'higher ground' against business, corporations, and people that have children, but when responsibility for children has been abdicated by society...someone will step in."
5,Perfect,"Amazing knife. Built well, smooth operation, sturdy and very strong, nice comfortable grip, and comes with a pouch that can be put verically or horizontally onto your belt. Perfect."
3,"Great content, poorly constructed","Love the book but the first time I opened it all the pages fell out of the binding. Amazon was great about sending me a replacement, but it too fell apart after being opened only about 3 times."
1,Cheap ingredients that actually make your cat gain weight,"I fed my cat Iams Weight Control for 3 years before she died of stomach cancer. In that time she only lost weight when the cancer started. Her coat was dull and rough.That experience led me to research feline nutrition both online and by talking to animal nutritionists. If you read the ingredient list in Iams Weight Control, you'll see that most of the first few ingredients are corn and other grains. Cats are carnivores and need a high-protein diet, not a high-carb diet. The extra carbs are stored as fat. If you have an overweight cat, steer clear of Iams and go with a high-protein, low-carb, grain free premium food.My two young cats eat a variety of high quality food. I feed them 3-4 times a day and they are at a perfect weight. Their coats are shiny and soft. You can feed your cats a lot better food than this."
4,good pc,"I like the machine, but I don't like the win XP Media edition. I removed 20 or 30 games from the hard drive. I created the CD Rom installation CD's and tested them by reinstalling the operating system. I had to reinsert several of the CD's two or three times before they would read correctly. I like the ability to buy just the PC, keyboard, and mouse. My monitor, printer, and speakers that I already had were fine for this system."
5,Amazing results,"Great product! My skin is hard to adapt, but this product is amazing. The touch is inctedible after 3 days!"
5,defies the genre,"I originally got this game as a demo before demos were even popular. It only barely worked on my system, but I was so hooked I ended up completely refiguring my computer so that I could play the real version. There you have it. It's quite good."
1,No more monthly fees please!,"I am an old school D&D; fan and love online gaming. I am sorry though, $40+ for a game and then a monthly charge and a small lvl cap that people reached in mere days?? I don't care how much fun a game is, LOSE the monthly fee! There are tons of great FREE online games./off soapbox now."
1,"Sadly, not impressed","I tried it, then cancelled it. It was too much initial work, not enough play. My comparision was based on Diablo II==100%"
1,Dissapointment is an understatement,"I got this game as a birthday, and was very excited to try it out. Needless to say I played the game for nearly a week before giving up completely.The idea behind it is great. An MMORPG that doesn't revolve around killing endless amounts of rats and pigs to level up. It promoted party-based adventuring to the extreme. The modules/quests were self-contained. Everything seems just great.But the execution for this game is extremely poor. The quests just aren't much fun. The combat system is ok. The way leveling is done doesn't make much sense, especially for a game based on D&D.;I dunno, I found this game extremely boring (even for an MMORPG). This game was my second time trying games in the MMORPG genre, and it'll definitely be my last...Don't waste your money."
1,Nothing to do with D&D,"This game wasa) A let-downb) A total rip-offAt $50 and a $15 monthly charge, I had high expectations. Instead I get a weak, first-person shooter disguised as a RPG. My main beefs:1. Combat system is horrible. Monsters jump around in real time, and half the time you can't target them. Trip, dodge, etc. don't work and are useless.2. Spells are difficult to cast in combat and the interface is clunky and bug-ridden. I frequently had to exit the game to get inventory problems worked out.3. No solo adventuring -save for the ""practice adventure"" in the beginning.4. Monsters make no noise -for $15 a month, I expect to hear a Goblin grunt!I've purchased many video games over the years. This one will go into a special shrine entitled ""worst game ever purchased.""The game is absolutely mindless, with no story line, and no sense of atmosphere."
1,Try Neverwinter Nights instead!,"After reading some of the reviews I've decided to stick with what I know is a great D&D; title. For those who are hesitating to purchase this game, or have and found it disappointing, try Neverwinter Nights by Bioware. It still has a community that is alive & well. New content is being released by Bioware & its community frequently. There are still active open servers & plenty of guilds to join for a more ""tailored to your liking"" experience. NWN Diamond has 4.5 stars from its customers. I purchased it as a pre-order and after nearly 4 years I'm still having a blast.Plus unlike DDO, NWN is not a pay-to-play game. It has provided me with truly limitless adventures and countless hours of enjoyment."
1,Poor quality control by Lenox,"I have received two of these through Amazon (one as a replacement for the first) and in both cases the center ""basket"" design is off-center. I measured it... they're clearly off-center. Amazon was wonderful in working out the return.Updated review: I have since received one of these directly from Lenox, and it too has an off-center ""basket."" This is clearly a design flaw in the product."
1,New Great Taste--Not so great--in fact pretty bad,"Spearmint altoids have been my favorite for years. My local stores have not had them much lately, so I was thrilled to be able to get them online.Wow....how disappointing.They tasted so awful with a very artificial type of flavor.I have also recently bought the wintergreen and peppermint, and these are still pretty good.But why did they have to go messing with the spearmint!!I hope they go back to the Old great taste."
1,I don't understand the hype,"I just purchased some of these mints at the store. They don't have that great of a taste and they aren't strong at all until you bite into them, and then the mint flavor quickly disappears and doesn't leave your mouth minty in the least bit. I don't know where all these high reviews are coming from. They taste like cheap mints in my opinion. I've had better."
1,Curiously BAD .. new great taste!,"Is it possible to obtain the ""Spearmint Naturally Flavored"" my favorite for a long time. I just bought a dozen pack to stock up and they were ""New Great Taste!"" but curiously bad. Oh My Oh My, these are bad. Don't like them at all. AND they are Naturally and Artificially Flavored. Why did you ruin a good product? Could I trade you these ""New Great Taste! Same Punch!"" For some old really great taste and delicious, I can't even give them away, no one wants them once they taste them.To your new great taste ... I say NO THANKS, I'm done with Altoids if this is your way of changing a good product. You show the old box on your web site but that is NOT what is now in the store!They are way stronger than the US dollar at the moment. If uncle keeps borrowing money, mints can remain curiously supreme.By the way, my favorite is ""Ginger"" but of the mints, it WAS Spearmint."
2,New Altoids Spearmint,"Altoids Spearmint has been my favorite mint for many years. It has become increasingly hard to find the Spearmint tins here though. I will usually buy several tins whenever I can find them, not knowing when I will find them again. I finally ran out of my supply and went looking for a refill. I was able to find them at CVS. I noticed the label said NEW GREAT TASTE.....Well, I won't exactly say YUCK, but these no longer taste like Spearmint at all. I don't know what they are using as a substitute for their original Spearmint oil, but is is a VERY POOR substitute. I now have two tins of these mints to eat. They are edible, but nothing I would buy again. Such a shame ! ! !"
5,A picture of a time becoming increasingly nostalgic.,"This narrative provides a commonality of experiencefor the servicemen of the WW2 generation and offers'a testament of loyalty and sacrifice to futuregenerations of Americans.A ""must read"" for historians and descendents ofWW2 personnel."
1,Miserable quality,"These so-called adapters are of such poor quality, it is not worth your few dollars to get them, even with Prime. They are not milled to the standard 3.5mm plug spec, and you may run into the problem I did, which is that it ruined the device I plugged into. I'm handy with the soldering iron, so I will be able to fix it, but this purchase will cost me more to repair the damage than I saved by not getting the Monster adapter."
1,Complete Drivel,"The author was more impressed with his being a team leader that doing justs to the historic Peshtigo fire. The mundane radio calls and flash backs didn""t help his effort."
4,Can find cheaper elsewhere,Good product. Smells nice and keeps away bugs. Amazon is expensive. I just found this product in a two pack at Bed Bath & Beyond for half the price!
2,What could be more boring than a fishing show?,"Sure, it was supposed to be a spoof on a fishing show. Imagine creating a home movie that spoof's your grandmother doing laundry and petting the cat. You wouldn't waste your time... which begs to question why these guys did. Willem Dafoe manages to once again bring a brilliant performance to an otherwise graham cracker production. I wouldn't return it to Amazon, but if John showed up at my doorstep and apologized, I would gladly accept. It gets two stars, because I reserve the 1 star rating for anything with Bill Paxton."
5,Fishing?,"Advanced Comedy for those not amused by anything in the theatres. If you do not like your comedy spoonfed to you or you don't enjoy being clubbed over the head with comedy, this is for you! I grew up watching fishing shows with my father and I always hated them. John Lurie has taken something I despised and made me laugh out loud many times watching it. The Commentary by Lurie is a blast as well!"
3,Fast-paced story...,"I liked the fact that the whole story took place in a very short amount of time (about one day), and included some looks back into past events which lead up to the current happenings.My main complaint about the book is that there was not more Alan! I am a big fan of his character, but don't care too much for Lauren's character. Some of the minor plot details are a bit far fetched, but it's not too hard to overlook and remain caught up in the fast-paced action. Overall, I was a bit disappointed, but not enough to stop reading White's work."
3,Definitely not his best,"I have read his series from the beginning, and this one I found to be quite disappointing. The ""twists"" that bring you to the surprise ending just wouldn't work at all. Emma's character is too syrupy, especially at the end, and the regular characters, especially Adrienne and even Raoul, were off-character and not terribly believable in this book. (Yeah, Adrienne's going to be checking Cozy out after what happened with her husband. Uh-huh. And Raoul would just happen to show up at the emergency room with that under his arm at the critical moment. Yep.) I'm just disappointed."
2,"Weak story, weak characters, weak book","This was my first SW book and probably my last. The plot was interesting for about 30 pages and then simply stopped being interesting. Unbelievable characters - I hate it when the protagonists in a series have earth shattering, life threatening experiences in every book - and the McGuffin held my interest for about 0 seconds. Too much put into too many pages. Additionally, what drove me crazy were all these similar sounding names of the main characters (Casy - Cozy, Sam - Scott). And there were too many characters, 2 policemen, 2 lawyers, very confusing. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the fact that I read it completely and didn't throw it out after 50 pages as I usually do with duds."
4,High Energy Suspense,"The story Stephen White tells here spans only about 24 hours (with a few flash backs), and that is about all the time it took me to read it. A fascinating premise, interesting characters, and dialog that moves the story along almost effortlessly contribute to a fast and enjoyable read."
2,Boring,"I thought this book started out interesting, but it kept getting more and more dull. I finished the book anyway, because I thought it would get better towards the end, but it didn't. I don't recommend this one!!!!!!"
5,Wonderful,This was a movie even my kids liked. It was something that the whole family can enjoy and it goes well with the book entitled: From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. My kids read the book and then watched the movie to find the differences and similarities. Great reading and great movie.
4,GOOD REFERENCE BOOK,"This book was one of five that I purchased to learn Netware 3.12 from ground zero. It has been the best reference book of the lot, though it has not provided answers to all of my questions and problems.I gave it four stars because it does not contain the answer to my current problem, at least not yet."
5,Great Pantyhose!,"These pantyhose are the best I've ever found. They fit well with no bagging at the ankles or anywhere and are very sheer. I got tired of trying to find my size in the color I wanted at local department stores and ordered them online so I could get exactly what I wanted and as many pair as I wanted. Even though these are very sheer, they last a long time. I bought 6 pair of City Beige and 6 pair of Black. These will last me at least a year. I wear them to work and on dressy occasions on weekends. I don't feel comfortable with bare legs and bare feet in dressy shoes, so I wear these pantyhose and get the bare look because they are so sheer."
1,Battery-Eater,Bet the designed circuit or the one that I bought has problem. It is a battery eater even it is off. Every few days batteries have to be replaced even it hasn't been used if I don't take the batteries outta it. So far my battery cost more than this camera.
5,Great Book 4 Competive Swimmers!20 stars,"I loved it, and as a competive swimmer myself I found that the book was exactly like what I go through when I swim. I wish it did not go out of print!! :-("
2,Verbose and poorly written,"We used this book for our materials science class, and while it contained a lot of information the information was very poorly presented. The text would often refer to figures and tables nowhere in the vincinity, and it was written in such a way that it was extremely difficult to follow. They didn't emphasize the important parts, so it was unclear what we should've known."
1,Rednecks can write??,"This book was the most homophobic, intolerant book I have ever laid my eyes upon. The Authors of this atrocity need to realize that there are some people in this country who aren't Christian, and don't want to be oppressed by your religious rulings.If you don't like homosexuals (someone who is born with a biological, hormonal imbalance in their brain and who is not prone to a choice on sexuality) then you can sit at home and complain about it with all your intolerant friends.Acceptance, please."
1,"This is My One Commandment,","This is my one commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you. John 15.12.Listen to Him, no him."
1,who is afraid of the big bad homos?,"Now who do you think would be afraid of the big bad homos trying to take over the world? My first guess would be people insecure about their own sexuality.Its okay to be gay. You don't need to be afraid. If exposure to and tolerance of homosexuals threatens you, you might want to examine your motives instead of the motives of your so called enemies. I think the problem lies within the authors, not the community he tries to condemn."
1,Very sad that anyone would believe such paranoid tripe...,"Move along, thinking folks, nothing to see here.More deluded paranoia and preaching to the misguided choir, strictly for the sort of people so gullible and brainwashed as to be able to believe the childishly absurd claims made herein.The audience for this alleged ""book"" consists of those with severely limited thought processes, and those who enjoy a laugh.It's bad enough that there are persons so fundamentally corrupt and deceitful as to argue that >> not being allowed to violate the rights of other citizens by cramming absurd superstitious beliefs down those others' throats << is a violation of THEIR rights - that's sad, indeed. But that there is anyone over the age of eight who is credulous enough to buy such laughable humbug, that constitutes a national tragedy!"
3,Good....but not on par with what I expected,Big Bone fan but this album takes a slight step back from their previous album.
2,This is not a come back.,"I have listened to Bone Thugs back in the days from their first album ""Faces of Death"". In comparison to their older albums (their first five albums) this album ""Stenght & Loyalty"" cannot compete. There is a lot of R&B incorporated which is not what most RAP/Hip-Hop listeners are looking for; R&B that is not top of the chart worthy (with the exception of ""Lil' Love). Bone Thugs don't need to drop the R&B, but they need to start making more RAP/Hip-Hop style melodies/beats. I am sorry to say, in exception to a few songs on this album this album is a disappointment just like their other albums after ""BTNH Resurrection""."
5,If you are a real/true Bone Thugs N Harmony fan this is a must buy!,"Owning every single album Bone Thugs N Harmony has released the following is my 1-10 scale ( 10 being best ) regarding each track.Flow Motion - 10+ ( The best song on this album...period! )Bump In The Trunk - 10Wind Blow - 10I Tried - 9Lil Love - 10 ( The Mariah and Bone colaboration is always a 10 )C Town - 9Order My Steps - 7 ( It's nice that you love the Lord but don't over-emphasize this sooo much )Streets - 99mm - 9Gun Blast - 9Candy Paint - 9So good, So right - 9Sounds The Same - 9Never Forget Me - 10Just Vibe - 10*Would this album be better if Bizzy Bone would be included? Of course it would and anyone who says it wouldn't is living on a different planet but working with what they had this is one excellent album!"
5,LatinGuyInTheBayArea,If you love Bone Thugs-N-Harmony you will really like this new album. I listen to it all the time on the way to and home from work - (It's got some slap) now go out and buy it~!
1,Zareba K9 Electric Fence Charger - Don't Buy This Unit,"Very disappointingZareba K9 Fence Controller for Zareba Pet and Garden Kit. Just doesn't work, and after several calls to the manufacturer's tech support group - who are pleasant and helpful, they said to return it (but from the techie's comments it sounds like they get a lot of complaints about the K9 unit.) And NO, it wasn't my wiring, since my 17-gauge galvanized wired fence line with porcelain insulators activated just fine as soon as I connected it to a Havahart charger SS-725, which, unlike the K9, has a conventional ground terminal."
3,Original text and some serious misprints,"As other reviewers have noted, this is a translation which de-Confucianizes the I-Ching and goes to a literal interpretation of the original text. Be aware that there are some serious misprints in the matrix of hexagram numbers at the back of the book; you'll have to either use their symbol/code system to look up your hexagram, or use a matrix from some other book. The Huangs also differ in how they read a moving line in the coin toss method (i.e. if heads are yang, three heads equal a moving yang line, other books read three heads as a moving yin line). This probably isn't a problem as long as you decide which system you'll use before you cast your coins. I gave it three stars because I found it most useful as a background supplement to other versions that I use (the I-Ching Workbook by R.L. Wing and The Complete I-Ching by Alfred Huang), but depending on your situation, this barebones translation may work better for you than it did for me."
5,Epiphany,"Keen writes of a defense of wonder and rationale for those who do. We are all too pressed for time, but if we were to take the time to wonder we gain perspective and, in my case, a certain calm . . . a memorable book that I first read some years ago, but one that kept coming back to me so that I wanted to re-read it now."
2,ALMOST SCARES YOU,Ghost Story wants to scare you but it just misses right to the end. Krige is excellant I must admit as the ghost. The story line is very good and the book must have been very good but the way the script was put together for the movie was awful. The movie never really scares you except for the scene at the end when Krige (The Ghost) goes down in the shivery water trapped in a car. An average horror movie at best.
4,A little too much 'in your face.',"A very fine ghost story, as was the book, with a great cast. The only flaw, and it's formidable, is the occasional appearance of the ghost as a rotting corpse. The best ghost stories infer, hint, tease. For instance, the original film version of ""The Haunting"" was so much creepier than the second one. Despite the flaw, I enjoy ""Ghost Story"" and recommend it be watched in the comfort of a warm house on a cold winter night."
5,"Everything good said about this book is true, but . . .","But they forgot to tell you one important thing. Make sure you have read his other books first!!! CC the masterful magician tells many of his tricks in this wonderfully written book, and if you read this first then go read his other works it is like being told how to pull a rabbit out of a hat, then watching a show where he uses the tricks that were just demystified. Great book!"
5,A quote from a Kirkus STARRED review.,"""...a deeply moral and philosophical work with important messages about life, death, relativity, heroism, and why bad things sometimes happen to good people. Essential for the many fans of Crutcher's work, and new readers will go from here to his fiction."" ---Kirkus Reviews, STARRED REVIEW, April 1, 2003"
5,Finish Line Degreaser,"Bought this to use with the finish line chain cleaner.It does what it says.I've read some reviews that complained about it leaving a whitish residue on the chain, but I don't really care. It does leave a bit of a whitish residue but it seems as once you oil the chain it's fine.Would I use something like simple green? I probably will try that once I use the rest of this up.For now, it does the job and does it well."
5,Great chain degreaser,I needed a really good degreaser to use in my chain cleaner for my new-to-me bike with a very difficult to remove grease that was used by the previous owner. Other Finish Line products had performed very well for me so I decided to try this degreaser and glad I did my chain looks new.
5,Lenox Autumn,I ordered this Lenox Autumn China for a Christmas present. I had never ordered china through Amazon and was not sure about the vendor. I was very pleased with the product and the speed with which it arrived.
4,Kids' Quest Bible Review,"The product was in pristine condition, like new, and turned out to be all that it promised in the advertisement."
5,Exceptional Bible for children,"Zondervan has always been known for its excellent products and this is no exception. What a wonderful Bible for kids ages 5-12, and even for adults! Written at a third garde reading level, this Bible is easy to understand and I enjoyed reading the answers to questions that kids (and yes, even adults) ask about God, heaven, and the world around them. The use of blue and red for the print is eye catching and easy on the eyes (and yes, much less boring too) The illustrations are cute and made me smile often. A dictionary and topical index is included. Parents and grandparents, no need to hesitate on the purchase of this particular Bible. Much time and effort has been expended to make it as easy to understand while being true to the original text as possible. I even recommend this to adults who find themselves confused by other versions."
2,needs to work on the beats and lirics,they need to get some better lirics like CHEZINA (el mejor) and some beats like THE NOISE or PLAYERO
1,Poor Quality,I would suggest paying a little more and getting a better quality toner cartridge. Since installing it I have been getting black spots and specs of toner all over my printouts and copies. I would not purchase these again.
4,No-risk choice,"Okay, maybe there are cheaper alternatives, but I'm just leery of using anything but a factory replacement toner cartridge in my business printer. I don't do a lot of printing, but when I do it has to be fast and look good. For almost four years the process has been the same: When I run out of toner I take my spare cartridge off the shelf, order a replacement from Amazon (which arrives in just a few days), and life goes on. I don't measure output in quantity, but I know the quality will always be good. There may be cheaper alternatives, but I'm willing to pay what looks like a very small premium for peace of mind."
1,Low Cost but Terrible Quality,"There is a stripe running down the middle of every page, the ink is inconsistent (leaves streaks, dark and light spots) and prints some material illegibly.Tried a second cartridge with the same results.Contacted seller and their response was:""Unfortunately the problem may be that you let the cartridges sit for too long, as they do have a shelf life. t this point there is not much assistance we can offer""I suggest that they send cartridges that sat on the shelf too long or they are just poor quality. I bought these in November and used them in March - a 4month shelf life, hmmm, that's not mentioned anywhere - in fact on end of the box there is a ""Use Before"" date that is blank.I'll never buy these again."
4,Works like it should,"This is our second toner for our Brother 2070N. This is working just like the last one we got. We are not power users, so these usually last several years for us."
3,"Clean and crisp at first, then dirty after 1000 copies (give or take)","When I first received this product, I was happy with the quality and the cost savings. However the quality deteriorated in less than one year and with approximately 1000 copies. The print quality is horrible now, so I'll have to bite the bullet and replace this product sooner that I had expected. With all the good reviews out there, I may have received a lemon."
1,CARTRIDGE DOESN'T WORK WITH A BROTHER MFC-7220,"Don't order this ""generic"" less expensive cartridge as a replacement for a Brother MFC-7220 (multi-function printer/copier/fax)cartridge. Worked OK for a few days but copies were very smudgy with black outline on edges. After a few days, repeatedly received a ""drum error message"" and with resultant printer jams. Finally gave up trying to print with this less expensive cartridge and ordered the Brother brand cartridge, which works fine."
4,brother what a cartridge,"The Brother TN350 Cartridge is a very easy to change With little mess or fuss, and provides thousands of fine prints before having to be replaced."
3,Holy Moley,"Wow, the product arrived on time and functions very well. After reading some of the other reviews I am glad that I spent more on the ""Name Brand"" Brother cartridge."
5,"Toner from Laser Tek services, Fargo No. Dak.","Item received in two days. Still using the toner and would use this co again. I used another low cost toner from a Ca. supplier and the toner was used up in two weeks. I'll never use them again. I thought that a Co. from No. Dak. would be more honest and , by golly, I was right."
5,Great toner,"Genuine Brother toner or inkjet cartridges are the only way to go. Every compatible I have ever purchased gave bad print quality and needed replacing MUCH faster than the branded items. Pay a little more, but get a huge amount of extra savings in the long run."
2,disappointing,"This book is clearly a compendium of articles and as such is poorly organized and repeatitive. The articles themselves are fine, but they don't work in book form. The author spends a great deal of time on his ""magic"", home-brewed ammunition and custom-built revolvers, which simply aren't a viable alternative for most people. It is certainly worth the read, but it is disappointing because I'm sure that there's much more to learn from Cirillo than is presented here."
2,Meh,"This book was required for a Spectroscopy class I just took. The explanations were OK, but they were way too basic for the class and didn't go into enough detail. I ended up buying Bernath's Spectra of Atoms and Molecules midway through the term, which provides a much much better (more rigorous) explanation of rotational, vibrational, and Raman spectroscopy. I think the reason that Engel was required for my class was because it also covers NMR, which Bernath does not. A pity."
3,dishwasher magnet,"I purchased this magnet for my daughter-in-law for a gift. Sorry to say that it was good looking, but would not stick to her dishwasher. I told her to put a little double faced tape on it and it should work for her. I have not heard back at this time. It really isn't worth the trouble to send it back to the company that sent it to her."
4,Great to have!,Works well as long as you can convince your family to use it!The stainless steel makes it hard to see on black dishwashers in dimly lit kitchens but it's not too big of a problem.
3,"It works, mostly",It is a reasonable design but it doesn't stay put all that well and it does require that you change it manually. I could easily live without it.
4,Buying after borrowing,"I'm buying a copy of this book after returning the library copy. The writing is clear and easy to understand. Common problems (example: middle valve sticking on a trumpet) are identified and covered, simplifying diagnosis."
5,Beautiful,"I will just say that this is a beautiful work. Piazzolla is a master of emotions, he really knows that music is the universal languague of the heart. Particularly breathtaking is Milonga del Angel, a slow, rather melancholic tune. It makes you think of a rainy Buenos Aires on a dark winter night...What can I say, stop wasting your time, get this CD, lay on your couch and be prepared to be transported by this genius of what the heart and soul sing..."
4,Comprehensive and Fascinating,"What a fascinating and readable story. The addition of conjectured dialogue, authentic letters, and numerous thoughtfully placed photographs gives this mammoth biography the feel of both a novel and an A&E; special.It is near impossible to condense this book into a review, but I will say what beguiled me the most was the concept of how the extent and grandeur of Houdini's worldwide fame--in his own lifetime--was conceived and flawlessly executed by his own will and brilliance in an age of no television and no Internet.The thoroughness of the book is what makes it impressive. It's also what makes it hard to finish. For the length of the book, I can't see how the authors could have made it more exciting, but I can't help thinking that some of the details could have been cut out for the sanity of the reader. I would liken it to the most interesting textbook I've ever read."
4,Secret Life of Houdini,This book was purchased as a Birthday gift. I was pleased with the presentation of the book itself. It had heft and new information on Houdini. Pleased.
2,Interesting Life made Less than Interesting,"There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating. Too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages."
4,Serious and complete,"This is a very serious and complete biography. I bought this expecting something more for the masses, lots of rumor and sensationalism. In fact, it's a very thoughtful book, with lots of detail and very little speculation, presenting many of the lesser known aspects of Houdini's life, including his campaign against spiritualism and fraudulent mediums, and his extraordinary physical prowess. Not everything was a trick. Many things he accomplished by sheer force of will. Houdini was clearly much more multidimensional than portrayed in movies and popular references. The book also includes many details on the culture and other celebrities of the time; the extensive information on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was especially interesting. I give it 4 stars only for the fact that there are no footnotes or references. I understand that the authors chose to put those on their Web site, but they're much less useful separated from the book they document."
1,Wrong Discs Inside,"I ordered this product and found that it had 2 disc#1, 2 disc#2, one disc#3 and no disc 4 or 5. I contacted Amazon, who sent a replacement that had THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. Likely a manufacturing error, but a huge one. I can't believe that it was a coincidence. They must have made this mistake on a lot of these sets."
3,My mothers favorite show,This not my favorite show but my mother loves this show and i cant wait to see her face on christmas morning when she opens it up.
5,how can you not love this,"Some of the best comedy I've seen in a long time. Each episode stands on it's own, Though having some history is helpful but not necessary. I have all 6 seasons and must admit I do watch them often."
5,Love this season,I love this season. I have all the seasons up to season 5. I will be buying all of the seasons as they are released.
5,Hilariously funny!!!!!,"I found the Big Bang Theory by chance, but when I started watching it, I just couldn't stop. Season 5 is great and I can't wait until season 6 is released!!!"
5,very funny,I have all the other seasons. I hate all the commercials when watching on the air. Love having the shows without commercials.
5,Great season,"Totally worth every penny, never gets old. I catch jokes the third time around that i never even hear the first time."
5,Great season,I am a huge fan of The Big Bang Theory. I had to get the latest season on DVD. I always get an extra copy as I wear my copy out.
5,Bazinga!,Just hand all the Emmys and Golden globes to this cast/crew. They are without a doubt the best on television. Great laughs!
2,less than OK,"The show itself is wonderful and I have been watching it in order from start to finish. My DVR didn't record this particular show and I could not figure out any other way to watch it right away. So given all that I was on the desperate side. The quality was not good. I got the story line, but the quality was ""jerky"" and fuzzy. I hope I never need to watch any more episodes this way."
3,A little dissapointed,I received the correct product but the wrappings were ripped open and the cover was bent. I was dissapointed because this item was a Christmas present.
1,Should have been left in the garbage,"We picked this up at the library because my daughter loves the Harry series of books by the same author. After reading it through once, I couldn't believe such a book was still in circulation. It not only teaches children that it's OK to throw all kinds of things away instead of fixing them, but that it's futile to try to fix things - *and* it states sprawling out and creating landfills in protected areas like marshlands is OK because then there can be more ""parks and playgrounds."" I was beyond repulsed."
5,Everyone should read this book,"Instead in inuendo and accusations, This book says exactly what happened, event by event over the last 30+ years to erode the democratic society we live in."
3,A fun book for those interested in the beginning design process of creating a MUD,"The book starts simply and builds complexity. I would disagree it's a ""hack"". It's a very good start on the foundations of MUD programming, but for those who are still doing this (all 3 of them) you'll find that the complexity of the systems and design patterns used will be far different from what is illustrated in this book.Still, it's fun. Buy it. It's a great start."
4,A touch of class...,"Brian Howe is the man who resurrected Bad Company from a bar band status in the eighties to a platinum-selling act again,due to his great voice and musical abilities.If you liked his work with Bad Company between 1986-1993,you will like this album,full of inspired and mature songs that easily prove Brian's mettle."
2,Lyna Rainbow,"I just love this game it is fun to play. I enjoy doing puzzles and it just seems to amaze me. The only problwm is I wish was a longer game or had more to it. I got through the entire game in one night. If there is a part two to this game I sure hope it has a great huge extension, but I still love it. I play it over, over, over, over, and over again. Can't get enough of it. Chaou."
4,Pretty terriffic!,"I read this book with my son and he sat still and read along with me -- he seemed very interested in the stories! One day, I ""caught"" him reading the book all on his own! How wonderful! I will definitely recommend this book!"
2,Works but Nothing Special,"I had a 'live and learn' moment with this bottle cap opener. I saw a similar one at a party and decided to purchase three for Christmas presents. I unfortunatley did not read reviews nor did I realize that this was coming from the UK, nor did I realize that the shipping costs were astronomical (almost more than the cost of the three openers.) My order was placed on December 8th and after three days I was notified that I would recieve them by January 7th. Obviously ridiculous and after an email to the seller through Amazon, I was told the openers were on their way and I did, in fact, recieve them after 10 days. I also expected the openers to look like the picture. They did not. It's a plain opener. It does not say Worlds Greatest Bottle Opener. It's plastic. It works, but it's nothing special. Disappointed for sure. I'm usually smarter about my purchases, but have always had good luck with Amazon and just let this one slip by. So...live and learn."
4,book,book has great music. We were a bit surprised when it came that it was so small. You can't really read the music unless you copy the pages bigger.
3,"Low Cost, but works okay.","So the handle actually has a mini tripod built into it, but its kinda cheap. Unscrewed it from the handle and the cheap plastic barely wanted to screw back in. If you extend the tripod all the way, dont leave it any place windy for it will surley fall over. Works great indoors, but for small cameras or lights only. The picture showed a DSLR camera on the handle. There is no way i would feel comfortable leaving the camera on the handle for any amount of time."
2,"Cheap, junky - but hey, cheap junky might work on a back-up with a small camera","Bought this because of price - came damaged and returned - the last fellow yanked off the cap where the teeny leetle baby tripod sleeps, de-threading the cheap plastic in the process. So, hey, its only a tripod. Might work for you. I suppose if it wasn't damaged I might have kept it. But it really is flimsy. You have been warned."
2,it's supposed to hold a real camera?,"my husband insisted on ordering this particular tripod. i read all of the reviews and was still leary of getting it. he insisted--and now we have a tripod that is the flimsiest thing ever. i sincerely think that the only camera that this tripod could hold might be the one on my cell phone--indoors, out of the wind. the camera case is only large enough to hold a small digital camera, but there isn't any sort of protection or padding in it to keep said camera from being bumped or broken. (think glorified fanny pack) the only upside to this item is the way my husband rolled his eyes when i said ""i told you so!""."
3,decent starter,"i just starter photography as hobby. to get steady positioning, this tripod works pretty well. will recommend to other beginners over any other tripod in this price range. added advantage of the side bar mounting capability and the presence of a mini tripod. wish the bag attachment was a bit bigger in the shape of a holster to hold a real slr camera in it. overall good enough for starters."
4,PRETTY GOOD EFFORT!,"This is 56 year old Burns' debut CD. When released in 1999 it was chosen as Blues Album of the Year by the National Association of Independent Record Distributors and what a fine effort it is. Firmly rooted in traditional blues, Burns treats us to 14 mostly original tunes that feature some nice guitar work and infectious vocals. A worthwhile addition to any blues collection."
5,Glad I purchased this one.,"Almost purchased this book many times, but just could not get myself to pay retail price. When I was it for less than ten dollars including shipping, well I could not pass that up. I do not read many books on decorating from cover to cover. But, I sat down with this one and did just that. I enjoyed it very much. Finally a different view on decorating, it gives examples of room make overs for different clients, taking budget into account. I highly recommend this one."
3,Not as good as Family Devotions 1,"I loved FD1, so I bought this book with high hopes. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed. Where FD1 has thought provoking questions that spurred discussion among my family, FD2 asks uninspired, almost silly questions. (Where FD1 would ask a question like, ""Based on todays reading, how do you think you should treat those who's views you disagree with?"", FD2 asks questions like, ""Do you think God loves you?"" Well, DUH! Next!) I can not recommend this book for family devotions. However, all is not lost! I CAN recommend Josh McDowells One Year Book of Youth Devotions to use for family devotions. Excellent, thought provoking."
3,Mundane and Obscure Selection,"This is truly a rather timid and obscure selection of James Bond 007 movie posters for the 2006 calendar. The prototypes from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and LIVE AND LET DIE are mildly interesting but are definitely no eye catchers and that's what is wrong with this 2006 collection. These posters are dull and mundane. The GOLDFINGER and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE posters are quite handsome pieces of artwork. The Japanese composition for ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is well thought out and striking. These three are excellent standouts. However, the rest are just plain ordinary and uninspiring. DIE ANOTHER DAY refuses to go away and OCTOPUSSY looks a bit repetitious if you get the pun. Now, if we could only go back to 2005."
3,"King Diamond : ""Abigail - 25th Anniversary Edition""","*** - THREE STARS==================This CD smokes, and I've always held ""Abigail"" in high places when it comes to King's music. It's my favorite King release without question. This CD is a must purchace....As for the DVD portion of this sepcial edition release, I must say I was highly disappointed. It's simply not very good. King Diamond is an excellent studio band, but they certainly leave alot to be desired in a live setting. Not impressed. It's basically live bootleg footage of the 1987 tour, but the sound / visual / and overall performance is painful to watch....This is certainly not as good as advertised. Buy the CD by itself and save the money unless you're a die hard King Diamond / Mercyful Fate fan..."
4,Great,"The only reason that this got 4 stars is because i don't think the book translates in ""i am"" hungry or thirsty...You have to say Yo tengo hambre o triste. Otherwise this book is short, sweet and to the point. Great for toddlers attention span."
3,"simple book, a little boring",My boys are not crazy about this book. I love that it is in Spanish and English so all family members can read it to them in their prospective languages but it doesn't seem to grab their attention in either language.
2,to short,"it did not have many feelings, happy:sad hot:cold hungry:thirsty silly:sleepy when i bought the book i thought it would have more feeling. It seems a bit limiting to teach such a small amount of feelings in a book called How DoI Feel."
4,Decent Book,I was looking for a spanish book that talked about something other than just objects. I also like the drawings and that the book is very simple. My 1 year old can really enjoy it.
5,Best Folding Knife Ever,"Lost the first one. ordered this one the next day.Right Size, right Blade (&sharpe;)Easy and quick opening.Best Folding Knife Ever"
1,The first one I got wouldn't work.,"After waiting 10 days, I finally got this (what happened to my Prime 2-day shipping?). After fiddling with it for 20 minutes, I couldn't get the paint to flow past the tip. I tried to return it for an exchange, but Amazon's website wouldn't let me, saying ""We don't allow return on products containing ""hazardous chemicals"". Interesting, since they had no problem sending it to ME. In this case, any ""hazardous chemicals"" had dried up so there is nothing to worry about. I ended up chatting customer service and they agreed to send me another one. They even send me a return shipping label so I can send back the old one. We will see how the second one works out. I have a white one of these and it works fine."
2,Lots of hyperbole,"I found the claims in ""Chew on This"" to be rather exaggerated (as were those in ""Fast Food Nation""). The food available at a McDonald's or Burger King, or any other chain restaurant is healthful, and it is not uniquely prone to making people fat--unless they overindulge. Further, I wonder where the hamburger and steak and chicken we buy in the grocery store comes from? This book makes it seem as though only such restaurants get their beef from feedlot-fattened cattle, or their chicken from birds kept in cages, which I really doubt. The book is well written, and certainly will appeal to young readers' imaginations, but I think the views of the food industry are certainly skewed and inaccurate. I prefer positive nutrition messages--e.g., how to fit the foods one loves into a balanced and healthy diet."
1,waste of money,I had read a review of this book and thought it would be a good buy. Wrong. Printed on cheap pulp paper and poorly written with almost no content. Catchy title is only a way to separate you from your money and seems to be that was what what was intended by the publisher.
2,Item misleading,"The book title showed words in english and spanish, leading us to believe it was written in both languages. It was to be a present for a little Peruvian boy just learning english. We were disappointed to find it was only written in english."
4,just wondering...,im not really writing a review but i just wanted to check if neone noticed that this books ending is just like the ending of north and south by elizabeth gaskell? i mean it doesnt EXACTLY end like it but the things that occur are very similar... is this book supposed to be a spoof of 19th century industrial novels? maybe some other aspects of it are similar to other novels mentioned? i would like someone to comment on this
1,"this book is a waste, mistitled","I don't how anyone could come to the conclusion that this book even begins to fit its title. Out of the 365 figures showing the various ""techniques to fight a grappler and win"" only about 10 of them are even on the ground! The rest are mostly somebody standing up at arms distance apart! If anyone thinking of buying this book thinks that you will learn attacks on fingers, face, ect... from being on the ground, think again, this book is worthless as soon as the fighting turns to ... grappling. Save your money and buy something more informative from positions other than facing your opponent directly 3 feet apart."
1,This book is a joke!!!,"If you are naive enough to believe that you can beat a grappler by using the pressure points taught in this book go to a grappling school and try it. You will be proven thoroughly wrong and submitted the second you hit the mat. The best defense to grappling is knowing your opponents offense, which means you have to be a grappler to beat a grappler."
3,Pro and Con,"Hey Guys, I have not read this book, but I see there are a arugement going on. Grappling is one of the basic of fighting along with blows. UFC is not a playground, the rule are set to keep UFC ALIVE! I would study this art and see what i can do if it comes in handy. If it doesnt come in handy i will. TELL YOU this book is a waste of time!"
3,Perhaps surprisingly interesting...,"I managed to see this film quite by accident: late night on cable TV. Even at 3am, I managed, not only to be intrigued by the film, but also entertained. This is a simple movie, a funny movie, and it seems that there's no real pretence or desire to be anything else but simple and/or funny. Despite very little depth to the protagonists, I found it hard not to be attracted to them because of their veritableness and senses of humor. It's very down-to-earth, and very likeable. Worth seeing just because it is funny than the average modern 'comedy', and most of the time it eminates more feeling than the contrived, schlock, big-budget products of the Hollywood machine (see James Cameron). END"
5,passion and poetry,"I bought this because of Andrea's review, and I'm glad I did. This CD of Argentine music in a folkloric style is superb. It's wildly romantic, exquisite poetry set to beautiful melodies and played and sung with heart and soul.These songs are about passion that knows no bounds. There is so much love in this CD, it will overflow into your heart and warm it...and there's no limit to the times I could hear this, it's a work of art.Nocheros says in their booklet: ""...amor y arte son los fuegos divinos que dan aliento al alma""."
5,Proud to give as a shower gift.,"The parents receiving this item were delighted with it. It is sovery well made, and very easy to use in every aspect. The colorsare attractive and all the features extremely well designed andpractical.THANKS ALSO FOR YOUR VERY PROMPT SERVICE. I really appreciatedits quick and safe arrival."
4,"18"" x 24"" Winsor & Newton Stretched Canvas 6 Pack","I buy this product for my sisiter, she likes to paint and she say it is good for the job she is doing, she realy liked :-)"
5,Great value!,"I have ordered these stretched canvasses in different sizes several times, and they are a great value and quality! I have seen other reviews where people received only one canvas...I have not had that problem at all (knock on wood!). I will continue to order these as needed (the shipping is fast and convenient with Prime!)"
2,Inconsistent Service...,I have purchased this product twice.The first time it came complete: 6 canvases. No problem. Happy.The second time it came incomplete: 1 canvas. Pissed.I am purchasing it again. Let us see what happens this time...Update: The order just came. Incomplete: 1 canvas. Pissed again.
4,Vicious but missing something.......,"First of all let me say I'm a fan of these guys. For sheer brutality in a pretty extensive catalog of music you really need not look much farther. If you like fast, thrashy, aggravated, blast-laden death metal with a sense of melody this is it. The production on this disc rivals any of their others...the mix comes through your speakers like a tornado. The sound is huge and air tight allowing for very little room to breathe but the problem I have with it is the same problem i have with all of their other albums...the guitar production really is left to be desired...really muddy...think early Entombed without the clarity in the higher register. The drum work is as aggressive as it has ever been if not more and are mixed perfectly...in fact i would probably go out on a limb and say they maybe have one of the best recorded drum sounds on the planet. Not their best stuff but i would say the most aggressive to date and definitely worth a listen or five"
2,Captain of My Heart,"This will probably be my last book by this author. An unlikable heroine, an accident prone hero, added to an impossible plot, equals not very good."
1,This album ruined Face to Face forever.,"Don't buy this album. Don't buy any previous Face to Face album either, even though the previous albums were great. Face to Face needs to be punished for this crime against humanity. I'm just glad that this attempt to reach a wider audience has blown up in their faces. No new audience will accept it and their old audience has now rejected them because of it. The loose out on every level. Ha ha ha ha! Whah.. ha ha ha ha......."
2,I thought this was supposed to be face to face?,"Well I have to be honest. This one leaves me unimpressed. I was all excited, as usual, when I saw that face to face had another one coming out. Naturally I was expecting more of the sound that I love. But unfortunately, you wont find it here. I understand that musicians want to grow, want to do something different once in a while, but sometimes it just doesn't work. This is one of those times.I have to admit that I really didn't give it much of a chance. Maybe it is better than I think after all. But the only way that is possible, I think, is if you listen to it and try to forget that it is face to face you are listening to.Otherwise, if you are looking for anything like, say, ""Nothing"", hearing this one makes you think you will never hear anything like it again from this band."
1,horrific,"When i purchased this cd I put complete confidence in my favorite band of the time, FTF. I was utterly dissapointed with my purchace. I bought a fifteen doller single.(I know what you are being the only good song on the cd.) I never would have thought that FTF would turn classic rock to get a shot at the mainstreem. I thought maybe I would keep it for my new romance cd- to slow dance to and all, but only because dico-round won't give me any money for it. I love FTF, but this isn't Face to Face- it's Trevor Keith's Anthology. Don't buy it"
2,I hope it was an itch they scratched,"Well, I must say that this album does have a couple of good songs on it. I personally liked ""Overcome"" and ""Burden."" But all the rest of the songs are some sappy, overdone things that you'll probably skip over after the first 30 seconds.The syphonic sound with strings layered over the wimpy guitars are way out of character. I felt like Yanni and Kenny G hijacked this project.I was just beginning to believe that intergrity existed in the music industry, and they go and sell out. Oh well. I hope it was just an itch that they scratched, and they'll get back to making F2F music. If you want a good Face To Face album, get their self-titled CD. That one's got drive and energy on every song. It's 100 times better than Ignorance is Bliss."
2,Different is NOT better,"I anticipated the release of the new face to face studio album for 2 years. When I first put the disc into my cd player, my heart sunk. I had feelings of dread in the back of my mind ever since I read Trevers post on the web site about a ""different"" type of CD. I couldn't believe this was happening. I never heard of a band changing their sound, in their prime. I guess you could say the move took courage, but it wasn't a good idea. Although I have to admit there are several songs on the CD which are quite good, they're not interesting. The bottom line is that the reason face to face was so great is that they had their own niche in the world of music. They were the only band that could write such great melodies with such amazing punk energy. This is why they were one of my favorite bands. Now they're just another rock band. Weather the songs are good or not, there's something missing."
1,What the #$*! happened to these guys?,"Well. I bought this cd with such high hopes, thinking that Ignorance is Bliss would be an incredible album, but, I was wrong. It reminds me of soft sounding Pearl Jam songs. The song writing isn't even that strong. I can't think of anything decent to say about this. I'm sure a couple people who are die hard Face to Face fans will read this and think to themselves that I'm just pissed off because its not fast, but thats not the case at all. It just doesn't catch one bit of my attention. I recomend to anyone who wants to buy a Face to Face album, that they get any of their older ones, just don't make the mistake I made and spend money on this cd."
1,I felt like if I had lost a friend,"THE GREAT PUNK IS OVER. WHAT WAS FOR A DECADE THE GREATEST BAND, IS NOW COMPLETELY LOST. IN THIS ALBUM YOU CAN NOTICE THE ""FACE TO FACE"" BACK THERE... SOMEWHERE, BUT IS LIKE IF THAT FIRE IN THEIR SPIRIT HAD RAN OFF."
2,nice try,I have been a fan of Face To Face for about eight years. I've liked pretty much every album they have released and I won't say I dislike this one even though it is by far the worst they have. Most likely they wanted to grow as a band and stop playing tired old punk rock but what they should realize is that's what there good at. Some songs on this album are good but some ar so cheesy it's hard to listen to they sound like really bad Bush songs. I give the guys credit for the effort but fellas don't try this again stick with what your good at.
2,2 stars for the effort,"It is difficult to listen to this album. 'Don't turn away' is one of my favorite albums and they really departed not only from their genre but also from their style, which makes them unique, and is why I liked them in the first place."
5,Review of Veterinary Anatomy of the dog and cat,"This is yet another excellent marraige of illustration, photography and text for the novice and clinican alike. The format is easy to use and references are well documented. The photographs are equal to that of virtual dissection. Provides a Great study aid and reference for the practitioner."
3,"Good, but with one major goof...","While reading this tome, consider the commercial link the author should have noted: For each monthly issue over several years a Scottish Whiskey company awarded a fairly costly bottle of single-malt to the personal ad judged most entertaining. I adore droll, clever, under-stated British humour. My book collection reflects this. Yet my cynical mind wonders how many personals were composed simply for the contest?"
5,Great Bassinet!!!,"This is a great bassinet...the music soothes my daughter to sleep, the lights are not too bright either. It is easy to change the sheets and has a storage area under the bassinet. The only drawback is the mattress is real thin, so we bought another mattress (it was only $15)."
3,Budget Fax,"I need a fax only several times a year. Therefore, I didn't want to spend a lot. I had a similar item from Brother previously. However, even with infrequent usage it didn't hold up very well. It appears to have been redesigned, i.e smaller and more attractive. I'm hoping I'll have better luck with this one. One fax sent, so far so good. :-)"
2,Jamming problem,"This is a nice and compact fax machine and very cheap especially if you buy the off-brand toner for $5 each. The main problem I had was it keeps registering the document jam even if there was nothing there. And it would not clear it unless you open the cover. I could NOT use it until that is done and the jam message gone. I called Brother about it and they sent me a replacement that works (refurbished one). I have Vonage and I was not able to get it to work. My faxes went through on my line but got a message that says Poor line. And the recepient never received my faxes. Oh, well. Vonage said that they can get it to work, but I gave up. I am now using the Brother fax as a photocopier. Good luck!"
3,cannot receive fax,although they adv. you can use tam if you do hook up tel answer machine you cannot receive fax. false advertising.
4,"Good value, reliable operation","Several reviews of this machine have claimed poor print quality. You can improve this easily by switching from ""standard"" to ""fine"" or ""very fine"" -- read your manual. Have had no paper jams either copying or faxing (up to 8 pages faxed all at once without hand-feeding). I agree that you get what you pay for here -- and for my purposes that has been plenty!"
1,Don't bother...,"Trust me, you don't want this machine. The print quality is mediocre at best and the document feeder is non-functional. I have to stand over mine and feed one page at a time, which can be tricky because if you're too fast it puts two pages onto one and if you're too slow it ends the transmission. Get a REAL fax machine. I will."
5,Sending A Fax,"I bought this for my property manager because his broke, he wanted something simple and not connected to the computer, this fit the bill.He's happy and so am I."
5,Very Pleased,This fax works really well. It was delivered quickly and the step by step instructions made it easy to set up.The price is unbeatable. All and all an outstanding value.
5,"fax,copier","I bought this at Amazon for my son-in-law.He uses it for his small business,and says everything works great with it."
1,Not worth it at half the price.,"Fax quality is poor. Copy quality is worse. Jams easily both scanning and printing. Prints a full page report for every fax sent (or attempt). Will not retry failed faxes. Requires a very clean line to transmit/recieve, so it fails repeatedly when sending/recieving out of town faxes. Also, beware the very short time period to claim rebate.Simply put, this machine is garbage."
5,Brother Fax-575 Review,I am very satisfied with the item. It functions well and was very reasonablly priced.
1,The machine never worked right.,"When you buy a machine you expect it to work. I was told first it was the ink, then I was told (after the warrantee was expired) that I wasn't using Brother ink. I still have all the receipts! Customer service holds were almost an hour long, and then I'd get accused of using some illegal ink. I won't buy another Brother product."
2,poor receiving fax,"The Brother FAX-575 was purchased at Amazon, however their service was great, but the fax receiveing quality was very poor. I didn't want to have the problem of using print cartriges of this sort. I'm happy with the ink jet method. The sending was satisfactory, just slow."
3,It's okay - just,"The book itself is pretty ordinary. It arrived pretty knocked around as the supplier just popped it in a mailing envelope to save money rather than packaging the book properly to protect it the way Amazon does. But apart from that the binding and finishing is sub standard anyway with the gluing coming apart at either end where the end-papers join on to the body of the book. The text is crooked on the pages, and page 51, well the left edge of the text is unreadable as it disappears into the spine. Fanning through the pages the text and page numbers jump up and down like a fiddler's elbow. The book in and of itself isn't worth more than a few dollars, but the gift of the writings of Jane Austen make up for it. If I'd seen this in a shop it would still be there. Fortunately I work in the printing and publishing industry so I can get the book repaired to some degree."
4,Good workout,"I've owned this for about two weeks, and have used it several times already. Assembly took about 20 minutes and was very easy. In the two weeks I've had this, I agree that using it is noisy, but I believe it is due to the tread on my mountain bike tire. I'm going to try switching to a smoother road tread to see if the noise decreases. Either way, I'm very happy to have bought this as I've already lost weight and am able to ride for a longer time at a higher speed than I was with the first few uses.I recommend buying a block for the front wheel, too. Not for balance, but to level the height of the front wheel with that of the back wheel."
3,And one pill makes you...............,"The Jefferson Airplane's first 4 LPs, remastered for your listening pleasure. The first two have both mono and stereo mixes. Historically interesting psychedelia, but was this box really necessary, at an outrageous price?One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small, and the ones that RCA gives you, makes you greedier than all. Apologies to Grace."
3,"Wine, Women and Banks!","PASSION V. ARROGANCE is like the journal of one woman's account of love and commitment to herself, her partner and her dream. This is the story of two entrepreneurs, both women, trying to find their place and make their dream of a successful winery in the Midwest come true, instead they come face-to-face with the realities of success and of failure. The author shares the ups and downs of owning a business and the circumstances which lead to its ultimate demise. She also shares a very personal and poignant side of her relationship with her partner Angee. PASSION V. ARROGANCE is not a comfortable read but it is honest and insightful.Author Margaret E. J. Broderick has done entrepreneurs (and lovers) a favor by writing this cautionary tale of business, banking, bottom lines and continued faith.Vannie(~.~)Work & Family @ BellaOnline.comhttp://www.bellaonline.com/Site/workandfamily"
4,Small bowls - perfect for light portions or kids,We bought these bowls to add to a set we already had but found out that these are smaller than our existing bowls. I have found that I like them and the versatility they give us for smaller portions. They are in between a normal cereal bowl and a ramekin in size. Very easy to clean and store.
2,Short version.,"Oops. This is short version (first showing in Japan, later complete version was released). Some cast deleted, but credit roll was listed.This version is nothing, sadly.French release complete version DVD never released in France (only 2 Video Box set, but not easy to get now).I hope Complete version will be release some day.... (that version is 5 stars, but short version is nothing...)."
4,Excellent overview of Linux system programming,"300 pages - not encyclopedic - but a rich, thorogh introduction to Linux system programming and how to go about it using Kylix. Well worth the money."
2,The dial is not clear,"I ordered this item and returned it. The color of the background of the dial is so close to the ticks, which makes it very hard to see the time."
2,So so product,I ordered 80 pounds of this product to feed my winged friends. Two of the bags were fine but the other two had some spoiled seeds. I won't buy again in such a large quantity as by the time I found the product was defective the 30 day return policy had expired.
2,"Easy to use, but very disappointing fuzzy pictures.","Lousy autofocus - I replaced the camera once and the new one is no better. I am sick of fuzzy, hazy pictures!I consistently get MUCH better sharpness and quality with the Fuji SnapShot disposable cameras, as well as the Vivitar focus-free cheapie. Same shot, same time, same place they both put this camera to shame!Even with ASA400 or ASA800 film, the pictures typically turn out too dark and with poor contrast as well. If pictures are worth taking, they really should turn out better than this!"
2,GARBAGE,My drum unit lasted for only 3000 pages approximately . Replaced it with another one lasted even less number of pages. I will try not to buy a brother machine again.
1,Defective--we had to return---,"The drum was completely defective. It was not useable and had to be returned. We have not yet received the replacement - so we cannot comment on the replacement yet. We were disappointed in the quality, as this was supposed to be a new unit, of which there was no way it was."
3,Don't make mistake I did,"Don't make the mistake I did. While the Amazon description is fairly accurate, the description of this drum unit on other sites led me to believe it was a high capacity toner replacement. It is NOT. It is simply the unit in which your toner cartridge sits. It is not a toner cartridge."
2,"""Change Drum Soon"" = you might get 4,000 more copies","I had a ""Change Drum Soon"" message for over a year, and the original drum kept working fine. I finally had to replace the drum at 16,080 copies because of some smearing/double imaging.This trick, plus the tape-over-hole trick for extending toner cartridge life, reduces your consumables cost by 40%. Well under 2 cents per page...better than any other laser printer I know of.**12-30-09: The following trick is obsolete. HL-2040 is no longer sold** -->> The brother HL-2040 printer often goes on sale for 65 to 70 bucks. Just throw away the printer but use the DR-350 drum and the starter toner cartridge ($25 worth of toner)."
4,Saving money is possible,I went with this drum unit to help me save money. 1500 pages later and the drum unit is still going strong.
2,A Wrong Note,"Ms. Hahn mistakenly played B-flat in bar 36 (the sixth note), the first movement of the A minor concerto (Track 7, 0:42). This note should be a B natural. The Barenreiter edition used for this recording, the Eulenburg edition, and the Heugel edition all show B natural in bar 36. A facsimile of Bach's neatly written original manuscript leaves no doubt that B natural was intended."
5,Exhilarating,"Having lived with the magisterial Grumiaux recording of these works for so long, I been thinking of getting a differing version with up-to-date sound for some time now. This version from Hillary Hahn fits the bill perfectly. Some of the tempos are fast, but one quickly gets use to them and what is left is the feeling of exhilaration. There is no feeling that she, or the LA Chamber Ensemble is rushing. The slow movements are expressively preformed without becoming syrupy,as often is the case. Hillary Hahn's tone is flexible and radiant throughout. Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra is a marvel of precision and alertness, matching the soloist enthusiasm every second of the way. The sound quality is the best I have heard from a Deutsche Grammophon recording; the bass lines are especially clean and clear. Needless to say, I love this CD. I hope that Hillary Hahn has plans to do the Bach Sonatas for Violin & Keyboard in the near future."
5,So much fun!,"This is the CD that spurred my dive into classical music (I have a rock/pop background) and I have not looked back. I know the tempi are quicker than usual for these pieces; but I think classical music is in need of more alternative approaches to the standard repertoire. This CD is a breath of fresh air, a lot of fun and yet played ""perfectly,"" as is always the case with Hilary! Enjoy!"
1,Disappointing,"I heard Hilary Hahn live, here in the Netherlands and I was stunned by the performance. She played Bach, the second Partita. It was amazing. I was looking forward to listen to her Bach violin concertos. But when I heard them, I was really disappointed. She plays them technically perfect, but this is not what I heard in the music hall. Her violin concertos are not inspiring. They have no soul, no meaning. I wish she played them like she plays the Bach partitas.A dissapointed Dutchmen"
3,Will You Hurry Up Already?,"Like other reviewers, I agree this is way to fast. It's as if, she is just trying to get through these pieces as fast as she can. Like it's like hurry up this is boring, as if she would rather be doing something else. I know that's not what she intended, but to my ears that's what it sounds like. This is the 4th Hilary Hahn CD, that I have purchased. I've liked most of her CD's, but as a result of this recording am beginning to doubt her interpretation of many of these pieces. Like many other reviewers I am not an expert by any means, but I am thinking that being as young as she is affects her interpretation of the music. Maybe I will change my mind later, and maybe I am just used to hearing Bach a certain way who knows? To sum up my feelings, I will say she is an amazing violinist with huge potential, but like any fine wine needs time to mature. Time will tell for me, and maybe for her as well, but for now 3 stars is my verdict."
3,repetitive listening makes it boring...,"...because this doesn't need to sound modern to be just ""right"". The ensemble sounds crystal clear (due to sacd technology) but that's not enough. It lacks the true feeling of the classical period instruments and interpretation. Playing the notes in order doesn't make a music to be good... this need something else, with conductors and/or keyboardists like Christopher Hogwood, Trevor Pinnock or Christoph Rousset. Certanly miss Hahn has something interesting to show about her technique and approach, but this is not a great match."
4,Rich in feeling -- but tempo is too fast,"I love Hilary Hahn's playing of Bach (and of everything else she touches), especially her debut solo recording. As usual, her playing here is full of feeling and vitality and is technically amazing. However, I have to agree with other reviewers below regarding the tempo. It may be that I am used to a slower tempo for these works, but I found the speed of the outer movements jarring. That being said, the musical intelligence and brilliance of this delightful young lady makes it worth the purchase."
3,Nothing special,A summary of all the details known to mankind about Kathrine but nothing special and no new inside. Great for someone with no background knowledge
2,Quantam Leaps,"While they start with A-B-C's... they leap to E-F-G without including D. While you're flipping back to see where you missed it (it wasn't there) they leap to L-M-N-O and you can't figure out how.The book should be named ""GOLIVE -- TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE DUMMIES.""Because that's how you end up feeling when you file the bookstore receipt."
1,"Terrible - Mistakes, Someone Write a Better Book","I am shocked at the positive comments about this book. For a third edition, it is pretty sad to see the major mistakes found in this book. The mistakes are not just typos, the mathcad excamples are incorrect! This leaves the hapless student to fix the errors and waste his/her time focusing, not on the subject, but on coding error. Furthermore, the author regulary just gets lazy (IMHO) and starts to do examples, fundamental to a student understanding the concepts in this book, solely in mathcad. So there is no traditionaly worked out problem, just mathcad examples, making them non-referencable for homework and more importanly for concept. The only reason this book is out there is because our professor couldn't find another book on the subject."
4,book,did not know this book existed but it fits into my book collection so I bought it to keep the collection current
1,Garbled edition,"While Corwin's work on New York and Dutch Reformed religious history is broad and valuable this edition of one of his main texts is a disaster. Produced through a computer system that attempted to read the original edition, the computer became totally lost in addressing people's names, places, and dates. Some text is unintelligible. Buy a different edition."
1,how many sock puppets does it take????,"should be the opening line of a bad joke, but when someone MENTIONED in the book, maligns the SUBJECT of the book, while hiding behind the sweetness and light moniker ASKSPIRIT, me thinks something smells rotten in stinkville.pee-u!!!!"
1,Cat got his tongue?,"I felt the same way about the authors use of a cat metaphor to discribe gifted research mediums....too bad, if anyone could raise the bar on this profession, I thought someone with his credentials could do so, but I guess not.Cat got their tongue? Why no opinion on their website?"
2,Good for the fact-minded people,"This was an informative book included with many statistics. I didn't care for the book just for the fact to it was too scientific for my liking, but that's exactly the point of it, so it might be just perfect for you."
5,Need more from allison but the book was enjoyable,"I bought the book because I am a fan of the show medium.I had no Idea she was a scienced based medium. Actually, I had no Idea there were such things. I found the book great because It introduced me to the world of research mediumship. I also found it neat to see the real alison dubois at work. I wanted more , the book was a little short"
4,Gives me hope for the future,"In the book Dr. Gary Schwartz says ""If ever there was a need for humanity to seek help in solving its pressing problems, it is now. Research mediums, appropriately trained and tested, could perhaps serve us by making it possible to bring forth essential wisdom and guidance"".Incarnate beings giving messages from the other side are able to see things that I can not. This information could make a difference in the direction for human beings to take and help us not to destroy the earth and ourselves along with it. Some of the messages are message of hope as well as warnings of catastrophes.I am grateful that research is being done to verify information being received from people that have passed on. We are in changing and challenging times and I think that books like this help with the transition."
5,How To Guide,"When I first saw this book online I thought, ""What could possibly be in this book that I don't already know?"" I came back to it again later and decided to buy a copy of it. This is basically a manual, it makes it so easy to use that I only needed to read through it once because the information is so accessable and easy to understand. The best part is the Allowing section. I was struggling with doubts the most. The information in that section made it easy to over come them. I have passed my copy on to a few friends who were struggling as well, and now we are all starting to see results."
2,Very little information and I've read it before.,Unfortunately I took the recommendation of a top rated reviewer who liked this book and I bought it. The information has been gone over before countless times. I would much sooner buy any of Wayne Dyer's books over this one.
5,The Law of Attraction by Michael J. Losier,"This book is ""hands on"" training and actually teaches us how to apply the law of attraction in our lives. I recommend it to anyone who has studied and tried to use the law of attraction without much prior success. An excellent read, it works well when used in concert with ""The Secret"" and/or ""The New Earth,"" as well as others. I can't say enough good things about this book. You simply have to read it and apply its methods to see real and positive changes occur in your lives. Happy reading!"
5,Law of Attraction,"Michael Losier's Law of Attraction is one of the best books out on attracting what you want. The books is concise with a three step, no nonsense approach.There are two audio CD's available. One done by Michael. This one is excellent. The second one is read by Hugh Gallagher. The reader's voice is a monotone, and if I hadn't heard Michael's reading, I probably would not have listened to the entire Gallagher CD."
5,great book,"thanks for the book, it was very nice and refreshing to try some of the activities and learn the secret."
3,Just OK,"I was really excited to get this book & it does have some good information in it. It just wasn't very big and I was looking for something that went into the subject a bit deeper. Ok for the price, but a little dissapointing."
1,Absolute Dissapointment,"Do not waste your money on purchasing this book - there is so much wasted page space that this should have been marketed as a pamphlet. As far as content goes - there is none. The cover and title make it appear as though the book holds promise of providing usable information with regard to the law of attraction - it is misleading. I find it hard to believe that someone would pass off something as poorly written as this book as being worthwhile in learning/understanding the concept of the law of attraction. Needless to say, the book found itself in the garbage! An absolute waste of time and money - a great dissapointment."
3,"Good, but has been eclipsed","This is a very good book. However, other authors in this genre, most notably Develop Irresistible Attraction by Connie Domino, have eclipsed Losier's work.What Connie Domino brings in are very important energetic aspects such as forgiveness. Forgiveness is one of the most important methods that effect manifestation. Forgiveness is as important, perhaps more important (based on the work of a Man for Gallilee) than removing doubt or negative self-talk. Connie has done her homework and refined other approaches such as the one in this book. Also, word for word, Connie's book has much more meaningful content."
2,Like a very meaty seminar handout - not what I expected in a book,"I wish I'd realized how flimsy the material in this book is. In that case, I wouldn't have bought it. What there is in the book is useful, but there's hardly anything there. Expect something the length and depth of a seminar handout. There are really only two extended examples in the book to illustrate its ideas."
2,only recommended for beginners,If you've never heard of the law of attraction before this book would be for you. If you have ever read another book about this subject don't waste your money. The book is very simplistic with one or two paragraphs on a page and lots of blank space. This book was definitely not worth $15.00. The basic information is good but not anything new and not presented in a way that kept my attention.
2,Not as exciting,"This book is only a few pages long. There are some good pointers, but nothing to get excited about."
1,Size matters,The transformer I got was a 9.99 transformer. It was tiny and not worth the price so I returned it. The size of the transformer should be in the description.
3,SWINDLED ON AMAZON!,"I can't believe that after years of successful purchasing on Amazon, that I finally fell victim to swindling! I really believed that for this outrageous price, we were getting the oversized transformer! We were sadly disappointed to find that this toy, which sells at Target for $9.99, was the size of the palm of your hand! Unbelievable! I won't be back."
5,And one thing more . . .,"I agree with all the rest of the reviews, but there is one thing I need to add. Moe's relationship with his wife is sweet, tender, vulnerable, and memorable. It is so refreshing, in a book that deals with the dark side of life, that Coleman creates a realistic, functional, loving relationship. A breath of fresh air!"
3,Now 16.,"I think this is one of the better CD's in this series, at least lately. A lot of the other Now compilations are bland. There were a lot of good songs on here, but of course, there are going to be the not so good tracks. I will indicate which those are in my thoughts about the songs.My favorites: My Band, Naughty Girl, Move Ya Body, Everytime, Ocean Avenue, Meant To Live, Where Are We Runnin'Average to me, but still listenable: Dip It Low, Hey Mama, Freek-A-Leek, Slow Motion, Leave, One Call Away, Take My Breath Away, The Reason, Redneck WomanHorrid tracks: Hey Ya, Dude, HeavenNo opinion: Just Like YouTo improve this, I think Roses should have taken the place of Hey Ya. Usher's Yeah or Burn could have been on here and Janet's All Nite (Don't Stop), I do agree with another reviewer that mentioned those songs because this would have been better with those.All in all, not a bad CD, but still room for improvement."
3,impressed...i guess,These NOW mixes are getting and better.Some of these tracks are more then 5 months old but whatever...Here are my reviews and the their Billboard Hot 100 peak positions...correct if Im wrong!1. My Band - D12 #5 B- ANNOYING2. Hey Ya! - Outkast #1 A+ Classic3. Naughty Girl - Beyonce #3 A-4. Move Ya Body - Nina Sky #6+ B+5. Dip It Low - Christina Milan #10+ C-6. Hey Mama - Black Eyed Peas #28?

3,The Fifth Season,"A slow read, but I always enjoy anything written about this area and by this author as he is very acurate in his geography."
5,Good deal!,The plates are just what I expected and arrived promptly. They were also cheaper than ones I'd previously purchased elsewhere.
1,ONE PLATE!,"After reading the customer reviews, I assumed that for $24.37, there MUST be six plates. WRONG. The large box arrived an hour ago and it felt very light. I was shocked to find that it did indeed contain just ONE plate. It was a very nice plate but for $24.37???? I don't think so. I've already shipped it back to Amazon."
4,Symphonic Excursions,"Symphonic Excursions is one of the most mature CDs that has come out of the North Texas collection. Being a collector of the Klavier CDs, this is a ""must have"" of the collection. The brilliance of ""Masque"" to the beautiful tone quality of ""Song Without Words"" is unmatched in the band world."
2,This album I would say only deserves 1 star or none!!,"Out of all their CDs this one I would say is the worst!!! I only found 2 out of 10 interesting which are, Paloma Errante and Caballo Mojino. The other ones are just not good enough. I love this group alot. It makes me feel bad to write a bad review of their albums, but it's the truth."
4,Excellent Discussion of Shenpa,"I have been through this book twice now, and envision turning to it several more times -- perhaps just particular parts that I feel slip out of my brain too easily.Her discussion of shenpa is particularly excellent. This Tibetan word, usually translated as attachment, is uncovered in detail with humorous and helpful stories. Shenpa is that experience of tightening we feel when someone says something that pushes one of our buttons or triggers our anger, or touches a soft spot, etc, and is the source of a lot of conflict.Pema Chodron gives a few suggested practices for dealing with the experience and I have to say I find them both simple and challenging.What would our family and community life be like if more people were introduced to these ideas and agreed to be more mindful about practicing them? I can't imagine, but would love to see it!"
1,Broken after first use,"This 'platter' is the size of a dinner plate so the use of the word 'platter' is a misnomer. After the first use I had hand-washed the platter and it was air drying in the rack. It was free-standing and no other item was touching it. Several hours later, while I was watching TV in the next room I heard a loud cracking sound and went into the kitchen to investigate. The 'platter' had split into two separate pieces. Knowing it was made of a glass material I had been handling it with kid gloves and keeping it separate from other items to avoid any type of offensive contact. This is very disappointing since I had received it Thursday (in the most extensive bubble wrap cocoon I have ever seen) and this was a Friday evening. So, I won't be ordering any Corelle again, needless to say. Very disappointed."
5,"Perfect, simple platter",We needed a set of these for various dinner parties. This worked out well. They aren't terribly exciting but do exactly what you need them to do.
4,Keep an eye out,"Snatch this up if you can find it! I can't imagine what it would sound like to someone who didn't hear it in the `80s, but for me it was an important record. I've enjoyed the LP version for so long, and got so used to hearing the anthology as a single listening experience, that the altered song list on the CD just doesn't sound right to my ears. I was especially disappointed to see that one of my favorite tracks - Maria Marquez & Frank Harris' ""Canto Del Pilon"" - is not on the CD. Nor is Voice Farm's ""Mamma Made Me Do It."" But there are still some great songs here; including the mysterious and hypnotic `anonymous' track, ""Billy Bee."""
3,"Like the brand, camera OK","I purchased this camera from my mother when she went digital. I like this camera, but the auto focus drives me nuts. As someone who takes lots of pictures of wildlife as i hike and horseback ride, it is frustrating to not get the picture because the auto focus won't focus for a quick shot. I have gotten good shots, as did my mother before me but we both dislike the auto focus.I will say that this camera is a very durable camera, we have been through some difficult horseback rides. ONe of which the camera in my saddle bag came off of the horse and still takes good pictures (except for the occasional issue when it won't focus on what I want it to)"
3,not what you expect,its got alot of what you might want but it dont have diagrams showing where all the electronic wiring is. thats what i need!!!!!!!
1,Review Judgement at Bridge,"If you have read other very good bridge books, you will be disappointed with this one. It is written in a dull, hum-drum style, is repetitive, relies primarily on example hands, and there is little depth to the analyses. I cannot recommend this book for anyone with more than a superficial understanding of the game of bridge."
1,txpinkshoes,This is no more than a cereal bowl and I needed something for a serving bowl. Such a disappointment. I did not order the other one that others had described as a cereal bowl and here this turns out to be that way. Such a terrible dissappointment. Mine also arrived only wrapped in bubble wrap - NOT in a box --- which made me wonder if Amazon sent me the right item. I love Lenox but this is NOT a serving bowl and too expensive for cereal bowls. Don't be fooled like me.
5,Definite Page-Turner,"It's a fascinating story that illustrates the actual development of the American West through the experiences of one manufacturer -- not your typical ""corporate"" history. A wide array of interesting photos compliments the very well-written text. Chapter 8 was particularly good."
4,Azure Bonds,"Action, magic, intrigue, qualities I like in a novel. All of that and more were included in this interesting story."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Reasonable DnD tie-in.While being a gamer at the time, wasn't that keen on the idea of reading DnD books. Gave this one a try I think because a friend had it, and Grubb's name.It was ok, with a mystery set-up and some standard DnD type characters with some decent variety.If you really like DnD books in general, I am sure you would rate this higher as it certainly isn't bad."
2,Not what I expected.,"This tape isn't about bloopers, it's more of a highlight film. I found the music annoying and even though it had some nice saves and some intense fights, I only enjoyed about ten minutes out of fifty."
4,"good story, well-written, pleasant summer reading","recommended, pleasant summer reading. good story, well-written, nicely told. donna huston murray has a fine touch with her pen."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"This latest Ginger Barnes Mystery is as enjoyable as the previous ones. Although Ginger loses her home field advantage, she proves to be a capable amateur sleuth even on the road. You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy Ginger's knack for unraveling this mystery. Donna Huston Murray scores a touchdown in my book."
2,"Like the other reviewers, I don't recommend this camera","This camera is a pain in the butt to use. Like the other reviewers, I also have problems with the lens. With brand new batteries the thing will behave strangely to the point of wanting to throw it away. Then right when I am ready to do just that, it will work again. There is a sliding cover over the lens to protect it, which is great, except when you go to close it again because you have to push it into the lens barrel. Overall this camera feels very cheaply constructed. The image quality is average for a point and shoot, ranging from decent color and sharpness in perfect lighting, to washed out and blurring in every other situation. I recommend looking elsewhere. Even the Nikon FM10 which is an SLR with interchangable Nikkor lenses can be found used for $150."
4,"More short, simple, and readable Potato Chip editorials.","Once again the texts of several of Charles Colson's BreakPoint radio commentaries are collected into the book format. As with A Dance with Deception, which I finished a short while ago, the short editorials focusing on the difficulties with maintaining a fundamental Christian world view in a seeming increasingly harsh and anti-Christian world are readable and, more importantly, thought provoking. Recommended."
4,"long jams, spontaneity of youth","I like this set, which is THE FIRST TWO CD's better than the following set of 3rd and 4th CD's. Sound quality has been well mastered, though its ancient source is apparent. Very loose, informal jam sessions-so if your a person who wants singles go elsewhere. Jazz fans may appreciate. Both releases sound like Jack Casady on bass. He is awesome but a much harder, driving, rythmic and melodic force than Phil's relatively more experimental style."
5,Time Jumpers,"Saw the Time Jumpers first show at their new location at 3rd & Lindsley Bar and Grill on June 11th. Vince Gill is now a member of the band and sang 4 songs with each of the musicians doing their solos. What a band and musicians. All excellent and great entertainment. The cost was only $15 and the food is very good and inexpensive. A show not to be missed. Only on Monday nights. Doors open at 7pm, show starts at 9pm and goes non stop for 2+ hours."
4,A weird little gem of an obscure movie,"You may have to be a fan of Penn & Teller and have a kind of understanding of their warped humor to enjoy this movie. But if you are a fan, you will probably enjoy it very much. You also have to take it for what it is: a low budget 80's movie with some bad acting (particularly among the bit parts) and a lot of Penn & Teller specific jokes. If you can get past that, it is a fun movie. The film follows P&T through a series of practical jokes they play on each other, with the pranks becoming more and more serious until things get out of hand with an ending that is actually quite poignant and surprising. Along the way there are some stand out comic scenes, particularly P&T in the airport, a parody noir scene with Teller using nun-chucks and the bizarre ending. It is certainly an unusual movie. I would recommend it to any P&T fan, or anyone with a dark sense of humor and an appreciation for camp."
3,Saving Grace,"Photography is a hobby of mine and a rather passionate hobby to be sure. However the photographs represented here are commonplace to say the least. There is no life, no vitality in the visuals. This is the world of James Bond. His world is dynamic and resourceful. These images are unfortunately contrary to that vision. Month after month you will find nothing better than that indelible image found on the cover of this calendar. They are getting rid of Pierce Brosnan and I just wonder who or what is next. Possibly the publicity photographer? The value of the Bond continues to diminish. Perhaps the one small saving Grace (excuse the pun) is that introspective shot of Grace Jones from A VIEW TO A KILL."
3,SAW IT ON PUBLIC TELE,"When I saw this it was constantly interupted by the channels hosts asking for donations over and over and over and over and over.......so about 30 min. of the DVD was not shown in lieu of this. At the end of the show I heard a snipet of ""Pressure Drop"" hoping it would show up on the track listing, since I've yet to see them perform it. It even listed it in the shows scrolling credits and of course it's no where to be found on this DVD. I'm sincerely disappointed."
2,Not much new on this disc,"I also saw clips from this on PBS recently. And from what I saw there and in the tracklisting, most of these performances were already seen in ""Rude Boy"" and ""The Essential Clash.""Where's the brilliant Saturday Night Live performances?? Why only one song from the ""Fridays"" show? They performed four. Same with the Elizabethan Suite. Only two of the four songs performed there are included. And ""Tommy Gun"" isn't even a live clip.Of course, any live footage from The Clash is going to be impressive, but I wish more new stuff was on tap here."
2,Too Bad...,"...the LIVE footage is great. Raw, energetic, unrivalled. The narration is moronic and it treads on the performances. You're better off picking up the From Here to Eternity: Live CD."
2,Not Impressed,"I was hoping this would have more objective information (matching statistics, salary info, residency requirements, etc) but instead it's just a bunch of personality stereotypes and nonsense. I regret buying this book."
2,"Too much about C programming, not enough about compression","This book's target audience is the novice C programmer who needs to implement data compression of some kind. The authors go to great pains to explain exactly how the code works, but they don't do as good a job on the algorithms themselves. If you are a competent C programmer and/or have any formal training in algorithms, this is probably not the book for you, though it may be a good jumping-off point if it's the only book you can get your hands on."
5,Poignant and Powerful Williams' score,"John Williams' score for Saving Private Ryan is different from most war films. Yes there is action and the music reflects that, however most of the cd is filled with understated music that makes a powerful impact on the listener. Perhaps the most enjoyable tracks are the first and last called Hymn to the Fallen, which is a touching memorial to those who died both during D-Day & during World War II. It is these two tracks that are the most memorable on this cd. Overall, I have to say that I found this cd to be totally enjoyable and a touching tribute to both the fallen and the survivors."
5,lets have a BIG hand for John Willams,"once again John Williams composes a powerful score to go with a powerful film. Several people said the movie was bad, and then that got reflected onto the soundtrack. The film was good so were the songs, and if you don't like it, well, that's just the price we pay for the Hippie Generation's stand on war. Yes, that's right, I'm a Gen-Exer. This movie, this soundtrack, they are patriotic reminders of the brave men, sometimes boy's, who lost there live's for us, for the freedom's we take for granted. If you don't think you'll like the CD, listen to the sample's, they are good song's, if you don't like them, tough. That's all I have to say, goodbye."
3,Not the best of John Williams.,"This soundtrack is a bit disapointing,except for the incredible beautiful ""Hymn to the Fallen"",one of the best pieces of music ever written in the world.They should have released the ""Hymn to the Fallen"" single,cause the rest is boring.The score for ""Seven years in Tibet"" is much better."
3,"good, but not good enough","Personally I loved Saving Private Ryan. But the soundtrack is a little bit slow and kind of a yawner. I love the 1st, 2nd, and last track, but the rest is not like a usual John Williams style of music. it is slow, and slow moving.I understand the need for simplicity and quietness in the movie in regards to music, but I feel the battle scenes could have been spruced up a bit with Williams style battle music, or at least a memorable theme. Other than that it was good. If you like quiet scores, then this is a good one for you. But if you are like me and enjoy heavy brass and furious strings, then avoid this one."
2,Sounds like a typical movie soundtrack album...,"I admit it. I read all the extremely positive reviews, and was duped into thinking that this album was somehow set apart from all other movie soundtracks. So, I ran out, and purchased it. However, after listening to it, I was truly disappointed. There is nothing striking or significant about this piece. The movie is outstanding, and the music within the movie context is fitting. However, extract the music from the movie, and what you have are 10 tracks that all sound about the same. To sum it up in one word...boring. Now, if your interested in powerful, moving music that stands apart, might I suggest the Schindler's List Soundtrack...the violin solos by Itzhak Perlman are truly outstanding."
4,Short interesting stories.,"Even though I read this book a few years ago, I remember it was Not a chore to read it. Some stories were more exciting than others, for the new True Crime reader you'll enjoy it- Easy reading, no big words you might expect from a reporter."
3,Nice price,"Well, the price is very good. It is less than 1/3 of the price of the 6' Dynex cable. The cable looks solid and feels heavy. However, I have to say in terms of image quality, this cable is not as good. With the same player, same DvD and same HDTV with the same settings, I tried the cable and the Dynex cable I got from Bestbuy (because I can't wait to get the order, so I bought one at a local store, I need tow cables anyhow), the Dynex cable is definitely better in image quality. The color is a little be shifted towards purple with this Axis cable."
5,"Solid product, at a great price.","After looking at similar cables in local retailers, I was a bit leery of the price -- but these are solid and the picture quality is great."
1,I want my $$$ back,After 3 weeks of use the cord shorted out and the coffee cup would not heat anymore - does anyone know of a heated mug that will last for more than a few weeks?
3,worked great -- UNFORTUNATELY ONLY LASTED 2 MONTHS,"This heated travel mug worked great. Unfortunately, however, in less than two (2) months it stopped working!!Heated Travel Mug - 12V and USB Compatible - Red (Red) (7.6""H x 3""W x 3""D)"
2,seeing is believing.,"i am not here to tell people what to buy or what not to buy. it is a 4 dollar part that is used to protect your engine, which might be thousands of dollars if it break in anyway.i highly recommend people search youtube videos using tags like oil filter compare, or something similar. there are tons and tons videos of people who crack open numerous oil filters and show you the inside. simply put, Fram is always, ALWAYS, the most cost cutting and worse out of any filter comparison that i have seen to date. (side note, Honda's oil filter look just like Fram, but cost double, what a bunch of blood suckers)spend a little extra now, can save you a lot later. my advice."
3,Good beginner's compilation...,"...but if you want the really Nitty Gritty on Creedence, get the 2 Chronicle compilations.However, those 2 albums neglect the awesome ""Keep On Chooglin'"" that is included here, because of it's use in the Hunter Thompson semi-biopic ""Where The Buffalo Roam"". And ""Keep On Chooglin'"" is a good enough song that should've been on Chronicle 2, in place of the extremely unnecessary ""Susie Q (Part 2)"".If you got the Chronicle albums, get this for ""Keep On Chooglin'"". That's it."
5,Some of the Best,This is CCR at its best. They've been in so many movies its about time they were all on one cd.
5,Addiction Theory: Beyond Psychology to Social Root Causes,"This is a top book. It analyses the addiction patterns of individuals from the perspective of the addictive patterns in society as a whole. Ann Wilson Schaef goes beyond analysis of the ""problem"" of addiction to a very encouraging vision of another way of being alive, one that is mostly forgotten in our numb modern society. If you are looking for some ways out of the cycle of addiction, this may be an important roadmap for you."
3,Good on tiny details not so hot on the big picture.,"If, like me, you are no expert on Eastern Europe, then this book is reassuring in that it proves someone out there is. However it really does nothing to help weave a broad picture for the reader or to explain well the context surrrounding the events. I certainly felt less confident about my knowledge of the region after reading it than before.There could be more overview and less detail and this book would not have suffered for it."
3,Ten Years?,I find it hard to believe that it took Donald Asher ten years to research this book. He provided useful information on a handful of colleges. The rest of the book was mostly filler. I did not have any sense of his personal experiences at the institutions he visited. This book was not worth the price.
5,Love this stroller,So after 3 kids and 10 strollers we found the absolute perfect one! My 3 month fit in it and so did my 5 yr old! It's got higher handles and steers unbelievably well - even one handed! And it's so light! It relcines almost all the way flat. It litterally fits babies to big kids. Can't say enough about this stroller!!! LOVE IT!
2,Coaching Youth Softball,"A more appropriate title would have been ""The Psychological Aspects of Coaching Youth Softball"". This book's strength is in that area. However, I was very disapointed in it's minimal discussion of specific drills (batting, defense, base running etc.)"
3,Psychology of Coaching,"This book is a great book to discuss the pshycological aspect of coaching. The book discussed what it means to be a coach and how to deal with parents. It did have a few drills at the end of the book that were somewhat helpful but overall this book didn't have a lot of useful information for myself. If you want a great book for coaching, buy ""The baffled Parents Guide To Coaching Youth Softball""."
2,"Really, theres nothing worse than a boring adventure novel","I checked out the 1976 edition of this book about a year ago from the library. Ironic that it is coming out now because they are doing another Kong movie.This doesn't surprize me, though, because the book is terse, slow, damn near impossible to read, and, ultimatiely, boring.I love the original King Kong, but it seems that from the start, most of its tie-in and re-incarnations have been sup-par at best.I recommend reading this for its historical interest - it is the ORIGINAL novelization - but the newer paper backs they are coming out with for the movie are probably much better."
4,Fascinating,"This book is an interesting introduction to the science of mycology written for non-specialists. It covers numerous aspects of the field, including such topics as fungi as pathogens of food crops, mycotoxins, fungal diseases of humans, yeasts, and mushrooms. Hudler weaves historical information together with the biology of the fungi he describes. Although the book assumes no specific background knowledge in mycology, I did find a few sections a little heavy-going. I found myself wishing I had reviewed Biology 101 before reading chapter 1 on classification and naming, for example. Overall, though, the book is extremely informative and enjoyable to read."
3,A Breezy Light Read That Hits The Nail On The Head,"As one of the other reviewer's said -- ""I liked it, but didn't love it."" However, it is a near perfect characterization of upper crust New Yorkers. I felt it had a Gatsby-like thread in that the two few ordinary folks (Jil, Frankie, Judy and Charlie) are profoundly affected by the goings on of the rich and famous. The main difference is that unlike the poor Gatsby characters whose lives are ruined, Wasserstein's ordinary folks roll with the punches and are too cynical to be hurt by the elite class.As for 9/11, I live and work in Manhattan and saw the Towers be attacked and fall, firsthand. Many friends and associates were lost that day. I lived through the sad, sad days and weeks afterwards. Beyond a mention of 9/11 here or there, this book could have taken place in the go go 80's or 90's. The book revealed none of the real 9/11 pathos that truly existed in the city.Still, it's a fun romp through one of the greatest cities in the world."
1,If you are Italian DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"Typical obvious (re-)placement and (recently all too common) Italian American as disgusting, classless, filthy villain/movie producer makes this book a real disapointment.So boring to make the Italian the new interchangeable bad white guy...tired and boring."
1,A sad end,This is not Wendy's best book. It might be her worst. No it is definitely her worst book. Wendy had a talent that she never really utilized. It is sad. Her end was sad too. Weny you take care girl. Write the big book you have in you and email it to us. We your fans will wait.
1,don't bother,"I am a fan of novels curtailing the lives of the glamorous, but this was disappointing. It had a promising start, but then just went nowhere and ended suddenly in a terrible mess. Save your money; I wish that I could recover the six hours of my life that I wasted on this novel."
4,Loved It.,"I never read anything by Wendy Wasserstein before but I really liked the title, characters, story, and the ending. It's so much fun reading about rich New Yorkers, and everything weaves together very nicely in this book. How great to have a look at a lifestyle that you crave knowing about and loathe because it seems so superficial. Wasserstein gives the characters life, and leaves you liking them in spite of their styles. Very compelling and would make a good movie. Definitely worth reading."
2,Not reliable,"I bought this to replace another Rangebooster in my home. The signal is erratic. Sometimes I get good signal. Most of the time the signal is weak. By the way, it is located about 10' from the router."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH GH3!!,"We had one of these adapters anyway and just bought Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock yesterday. The adapter does not work with this game. The PS button brings up the console screen, but no scrolling is possible and it takes control away from any other guitar connected. If you can actually get it into gameplay, the symptoms are similar to those experienced with other Guitar Hero games (no star power deployment using tilt, etc.). DON'T BUY THIS if you want to play Guitar Hero on PS3; suck it up and get the new wireless guitar(s) made for the system."
4,SockAnimals,This was the cutest book I have ever seen. It shows a story and directions about some really cute Sock Animals. I first heard about this book on the Carol Duvall show and decided right then and there that I had to have it. And the instructions were easy to follow. Great for those who love to make puppets and those with kids.
2,Too much secondary characterization;,"The hero Cougar a half breed scout and heroine Libbie, a spirited spoilheiress interacted very well together. When they interacted.I kept on reading the interplaying of secondary characters Phillip and Ndolkah more so than Cougar and Libbie. I was confuse as to who were the main characters in this romance. Phillip. or Cougar, Ndolkah, or Libbie. I thought Georgina Gentry spend too much time describing the interaction between Phillip and Ndolkah and not enough of Cougar and Libbie. When I read the abuse kicking scene that Cougar received from secondary character Phillip. I wanted to throw the book across the room. This was my first Georgina Gentry romance. This will be my last."
2,Kenneth Cole boots - 1.5 sizes TOO BIG,"stylish boots at a great price, but the size was far larger than advertised and now i am out $10 shipping and without a replacement size in stock. They were at least 1.5 sizes too large. Normally i wear a 12, so i bought an 11.5 - they were actually closer to 13."
1,Ladder of Rivers,"The copy was signed by an unknow individual, and I was not informed before I spend 85 dolllars on the book."
4,Teeth in a Pickle Jar,"I enjoyed reading this book. It touches on some serious topics in a light-hearted, witty manner. I particularly liked the ""Mamma"" character, with all her quirkiness and idiosyncrasies that would drive most of us up the wall...it reminded me of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" except that Mamma is Italian.I also liked the fact that the main character, Megan, is fortysomething. not exactly gorgeous, but she still managed to hook up with a younger man.I finished this book in two sittings. Once I got into it I found it difficult to put down."
4,Light-hearted reading,"This is a book written by a woman for women, Yet, as a male, I enjoyed it. Firstly, it was witty. Secondly, it dealt with a romance between an older woman and younger man that was originally plotted and sounded believable. There is an element of pathos in the story."
2,Why I was dissapointed in this product.,"I bought this for my child because it combined a craft like project and gardening. I was very disspointed to find that you cannot use the markers or the paint provided in any way with this, as the tray it comes with is plastic and just comes off. It comes with many seeds, however only enough soil pellets to plant 8-10 seedlings. This just frustrated us more. I would not recommend this item."
5,Great product/gift idea,"The Wild Divine Project has always amazed me and has given me the opportunity many times now to provide a gift for those ""hard to buy for"" people on your gift list. A much needed product in a sometimes stressful world."
2,Price ???,3 - 4oz bars cost appx $2.00 (supermarket)3 - 4.5oz bars at $6.00+ seems out of line.Is this an error?I would rate this as good except for the price.
3,What Happened to Sly and Robbie?,"When I read the description of this CD, I thought it would be a sure winner (after all, Sly and Robbie are one of Reggae's premier rhythm sections). However, the bass and drums on this CD consist solely of programmed beats and basslines, and does not sound much different than the rhythm tracks on my Casio keyboard. What happened to these guys? Why don't they play on real instruments? Monty's playing is fantastic, but the overall sound of the CD is a bit disappointing."
3,Class Dismissed.,"I really wanted to love this story more than I did. The idea is cool: a sci-fi prep school in the near future where drug regimented post grads are mysteriously being murdered, and two unlikely allies are required to work together to solve it.I was all in, but something about the ending fell flat for me and left a bad aftertaste. I think the problem was everything in this story is superhuman, and the ending is so normal. It almost ruined the whole book for me. I enjoyed the journey, but I won't read it again."
1,Wild World of Sports Bloopers - Baseball,"This ""bloopers"" video was not even close to being funny. There were several segments that where shown multiple times during the course of the video, I guess to make it longer. I was sorry I wasted my money on this video."
3,What are you looking for in a hostel?,"The title is correct in stating that this book is opinionated. If you have opinions similar to the authors, this book will be of great help. Personally, I don't agree.There is a hostel close to me which I visit occasionally. It's out in the woods, the middle of nowhere. It's great for quiet and solitude, and is surrounded by hiking trails. It was given 2.5 stars out of 5, because the house-parents are too strict (I've never found this to be the case. In fact, one didn't mind at all about an accidental mess, just as long as it was cleaned up.) and because ""there's nothing to do"". There seems to be an emphasis on ""partying"" which is something I have never expected at a hostel.The factual information is accurate, and for that this book is useful. I just think there are better choices in a hostel guide."
5,"""naranja"" is correct in spain","Great book, my toddler loves it. And there are no mistakes.For clarification: the color orange is ""naranja"" in Spanish from Spain. We call the fruit and the color the same in Spain (just as they do in English!). I know in Latin American countries they say ""anaranjado"". But that does not make ""naranja"" a mistake in the book. It is correct Spanish, found in the dictionary.It was just probably translated by a Spaniard.I was shocked by the review by a teacher saying that she tells her students that the word ""naranja"" is wrong. I would never tell my toddler that ""anaranjado"" is incorrect, even though we don't say it that way! It's just a proof of the diversity of the Spanish language. Shame on this teacher who says she uses ""naranja"" as an example of bad translation - and complains of seeing the mistake frequently. No wonder, since it is not a mistake. She should instead explain how different Spanish-speaking countries use different words, and all are correct."
4,good book for young children,"Sorry, but I couldn't find anything wrong in the book with the Spanish name for the color orange, which is naranja.Small book, good size for little hands, pleasant to read, with bright color illustrations."
2,OK reading,I did not care too much for this book due to the fact that the stories were short and not very interesting.
2,too many errors to ignore,"While the topics in this book have up until now been more relevant to developing Asp.Net than any of the other books (that basically teach you how to use Visual Studio.Net), there are an amazing amount of errors and typos. I have read about 150 pages and despite the decent treatment of development topics, I'm going to have to put this book down and start looking for a new book on the subject. While I understand that it's probably a good thing to have a product out there early in the game, I'm honestly a bit surprised that the editors at Que let this book get out of the door."
1,Don't waste your money!,Both my daughter and nephew refuse to drink out of these bottles. The nipples are really hard and it seems difficult for them to drink out of them.
2,bad!!!,"Every one of these games, except for Sim Safari absoloutely sucked. They didn't work, they were boring, they had no point, I suggest to just buy Sim Safari and save your money!"
5,Porsche Fan,"As a long time fan and witness to many 956/962 racing wins, and one who has met some of the drivers mentioned in this book, I highly recommend this book to Porsche racing fans. One of the surprising aspects of the book is its insights into the personalities and technologies that played out during their dominance of this era. Very insightful and informative, lots of quotes from drivers, engineers, CEO's and designers too. Many color pictures adds to the enjoyment !"
2,My thoughts,"I purchased Liquid Lightning directly from Amazon. For me, the taste isn't better or worse than many of its energy drink competitors. But in regards to the energy boost that it provides, I would have to give it a 3/10 compare to adrenaline or monsters. The cost isn't worth its overall quality for taste or energy."
3,Reminds me of cough syrup,"This is definitely a potent drink, but its taste reminds me of cough syrup whenever I take my first sip. After that you hardly notice it, however. Good deal if you can get it on the cheap and need an energy drink to satisfy your cravings, but if you are a novice try red bull, hansens drinks, or my favorite steven seagals energy drink."
4,Much Cheaper Somewhere Else,I'm about to buy this tomorrow (at the Toys R Us near me) but wanted to share that this toy is on average about $70 online. And at Toys R Us (when in season). I'm shocked it's $150 online here! Look elsewhere!
3,Much smaller than envisioned,"It's a nice product but really small. Only one toddler can fit in it at a time. I'm pretty small and I can't really fit in there to play with my son. I have to sit on the ground next to the sandbox to play with him. In hindsight, I wish we'd just built a wood sandbox with a lid on our own. This will be too small once we have another child.Other reviews mention the lid blowing off but I haven't had that problem. I live in Northern California in a super windy area and the lid hasn't come off once in two years.The lid doesn't completely seal so you will get bugs in it from time to time. The lid also blows yard debris in through the gaps in the lid so I have to pull leaves out of the sandbox a lot. The lid is basically for keeping birds and cats out.I'm shocked to see it listed for $240 here. The same sandbox runs $60 at a national toy store."
5,General audiences. It was a wonderful movie regarding animal rights.,We watched the movie only because we have a home in Florida where the filming of the owls took place (next door). It is amazing how all the people bring their large zoom cameras to film the owls. In the Spring there were 2 babies that would come out of their hole and the parents stood on guard on perches that were built around the roped off area. The movie was a positive example how we should conserve our wildlife habitats.
2,"Sorry to Say, I Couldn't Give a . . .","Produced by Jimmy Buffett, and based on Carl Hiassen's young adult book of the same name, ""Hoot"" tells the story of the a group of teenagers' efforts to head off development and save some dwarf owls. All very inspiring stuff, but somehow the cast of young actors never made it come alive for me. It was fun seeing Tim Blake Nelson (O Brother) again as the construction superintendent."
4,Read the book too!,"to the person who wrote the editorial review : if you'd read the book, you'd know the cottonmouths have their jaws temporarily stuck together, so they CAN'T eat the birds, or harm anyone! {Mullet deglues them afterrecapture & before he releases them back into the wild)"
5,Twain for your brain!,"Twain never grows old or becomes obsolete. Carmudgeon though he may be, his opinions are always interesting and his points of view unique."
4,Innocents Abroad,"On a recent cruise in the Mediterranean, I was told by guides and fellow travelers that Mark Twain's Innocents Abroad was a must to read. Twain is always a treat to read and the parallels between his travels and travails and those of a 21st century tourist are striking. Would recommend for any before or during a European tour - especially one on water."
4,It's says it's a free gift,"The pan for this price is okay. I like the Hoffritz better. I think Amazon must have purchased a buy out of brownie pans calphalon could not give away. If you go to cooking.com, with a certain purchase amonut, you get this item free."
5,Awesome book!,I purchased this to give as a gift. What a great book for firework enthusiasts! Arrived a few days after order placement.
5,An excellent high quality and durable Bokken for those into serious sword training.,"As a student and instructor of Kenjutsu and Wakizashi-jutsu I have had the pleasure of using numerous types of training models, both wood and plastic. This Cold Steel Bokken is one of the best on the market for the price. I found it to be well balanced and durable. The weight feels close to the same as with a real Katana and Wakizashi.I have used this model for many years while teaching my Kenjutsu and Wakizashi-jutsu classes in the past and found them to be excellent training weapons. If you are serious about training in the Japanese sword arts, you cannot go wrong purchasing this Cold Steel sword model.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Wakizashi-Jutsu: Official manual for Bushi Satori Ryu)"
5,Well made,"Pretty cool product. Its very well made and very sturdy. Although it cant cut you, getting hit by it kind of hurts."
2,Durable item.,"This item is very durable, but protect the hands of accessories is not suitable, and it will bend, if bending the need to use hand adjustment."
2,Not as it appears to be...,"When I saw this item I thought it would be a perfect stocking stuffer for my wife. However, when the item arrived it did not look like the picture. Instead of being silver through and through, the mother in the piece has a white strip going down the front of it. This is not what I ordered and it is not visually appealing. Had this been clear in the picture, I would not have made the purchase."
3,starter sleeve,I purchased this product because I start track meets in the spring time. It only lasted for one season. The stitching came apart.
2,Hand Wipes purchased from Amazon,The major problem is that they dry out much too quickly. They need a softer paper or cloth that holds the moisture longer.
2,I was very disappointed.,"Only about 1/3 monsters have an illustration, which is particularly disappointing since most of them are obscure monsters from (non-Greek) mythology whose names mean nothing to me. There aren't really any guidelines about the monsters' relative power either. Additionally, monsters you'd expect to find (goblins, orcs, minotaurs) are absent. On the whole, a very disappointing product."
3,"It's not a Clancy novel, but that's not it's purpose.","If you want to read a gripping novel on the next U.S. war scenario, this book will disappoint you. If you are looking to delve a bit further than the printed word and think about the scenarios themselves, that is, if you want a book to make you think about our current national defense strategy and the state of affairs in our armed services, this book will do just fine. The former SecDef has outlined several plausible scenarios where the U.S. is caught short due to our current (and drastic) reductions of the armed services. One problem I have with the scenarios is that Weinberger overplays the use of nuclear weapons. He minimizes the thought process a foreign leader would use before employing such a weapon. However, our current national defense strategy is to fight, and win, two seperate regional wars/conflicts simultaneously. Read the book, examine the scenarios, then think on your own. Can we meet the objectives of such a strategy?"
5,Long Tine Noritake User,The Noritake plates replaced others in our existing china. We love the pattern and the plates. We've had this particular set over 5 years and use it everyday. Couldn't be more pleased.
2,Where are the improvements?,This controller is worse than the MS Sidewinder I bought around '96. The only decent thing about it is that it uses the USB port. Much too basic for many of the games that are out there today. Probably would be good for Ms.Pac-Man or Pong. Thumbs down!!!
1,6?!,"There are only four buttons and two triggers. That is NOT enough for any game! I recommend the Microsoft SideWinder Game Pad USB. It has the same Plug and Play capabilities, but with 4 more buttons. I think it is a little more expensive, but trust me it is worth it."
2,contrived and kind of sappy; nothing to do with Buddhism,"I bought this book because I have been looking for something Zen-related to read at our wedding. The Zen masters are rather silent on the issue of romantic love, though (not really a surprise). So when I spotted this book, I was hoping someone had scoured the work of sages and poets and come up with some good texts. But I have been disappointed. Craze gives us some quotes by modern authors, and a lot of flowery prose that he wrote himself. To put ""Zen"" in the title is really a misnomer. Some people might enjoy it, but it's not what I was looking for."
3,calphalon,its nice set... but who needs 2 round pans? i would of perfered a pizza pan with the cookie sheet.
1,What can I say?,"This should get zero stars.I found this CD in a used bin years ago. I've tried to listen to it twice. This represents the absolute worst of Frank Zappa's legacy. It's just... wow. Words can't even describe it. The only thing I can think of is that it's worse than _The Man from Utopia_.I should have left it in the bin. At least now that I have it, nobody else can be subjected to this."
3,Doesn't keep time,"I purchased this clock to sit on the tv stand in order to read the time easily. It's nice that you can change the colour(for me the green is easiest to read) but I did need to adjust the angle of the clock. It advances approximately 5 minutes every week, which gets a little annoying to keep track of and/or change weekly. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,not worth the money,"I could have gotten a similar alarm clock for $1 at Ikea. This clock is cheap, small, and not very loud. Don't waste your money!"
2,Runs Fast!,"I bought this clock at a local mass-merchandiser. It was pretty cheap and had a color changing feature, something I liked. In the end, I returned that clock because it ran fast. In the (less than) two months I've owned it, the clock went fast about 4 minutes... Can't have that happening on such a simple device."
1,not visible from couple feet away,The clock was on a shelf and I couldn't see it from even two feet away. I returned it.
4,Vowell is hilarious,"This title is not as entertaining as Assassination Vacation, but it is still classic Vowell -- very witty, satirical, and great to have on a long road trip. I loved her critique of Tom Cruise!"
1,Don't be duped -- nothing original here,"There's nothing much going on here, so I'm surprised why so many people find this book so interesting. Vowell's no deep thinker and there's nothing particularly funny about what she says. This book comes off as the mildly entertaining musings of someone you might meet at a party -- but not particularly want to see again. (And, oddly, despite a claim to have an essay on Buffy the Vampire Slayer on the inside of the dust jacket, no such essay in in this volume.)"
4,Excellent Writing,"Sarah Vowell's collection of essays entitled Partly Cloudy Patriot is a refreshing commentary from a liberal who actually thinks and can express herself rationally without sounding argumentative. Her opinions are well laid-out and she refrains from any of the typical mud-slinging that one would come to expect from a book with a political bent, which actually makes it easier to think about the things she is saying rather than trying to defend or justify one's own opinions. Wonderfully written and thought provoking, I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in recent political history but wants to avoid all of the childish bickering."
4,Very Pleased,"I am very pleased with Sterling Silver Loving Family Heart Gift Necklace - Parents and 3 Children. The pendant is small, but I prefer smaller jewelry so it is perfect for me. The chain was a better qualify that I expected for the price. It is a short chain, but you can switch the chain out if you want. It shipped quickly even on the savers plan! A great piece for the price!"
2,Disappointing character,"I didn't like the main character. She was a product of a dysfunctional family with a tragic sexual abuse background. Every response she had in the storyline came from a totally unconvincing response to her childhood rape. All of this is glossed over with ""down-home, back to your roots"" platitudes. I found nothing quaint or folksy about any of the plot. Alma compromised what integrity she had in order to gain approval from her Appalacian kin. She was a victim and responded in kind which is all too typical of victims. This novel leads us to believe if one returns to their dysfunctional past, somehow it is freeing and we become better in the process. This book does prove that being a victim of rape does not make one noble."
3,Not bad despite the awful beginning,"The romantic plotting is rather predictable, and there isn't awhole lot of what I normally think of as ""mystery,"" butCollins describes Appalachian scenery and relationships with a realistic mixture of detachment and affection. The character developments are done well, particularly Alma's as she discovers that she has become one of those spoiled rich girls she despises so much and struggles to salvage the tatters of her integrity.The book is more of a trial drama than a murder mystery, but that in conjunction with the colorful characters and the mountain backdrop would make the story a fine movie."
5,"Great belt,","If you have to constantly go through metal detectors, this belt is great. The velcro fasteners make it truly fit vs those belts that just have holes."
5,great for [...] fans! ^_^,"i have been keeping up with srini's stickers since i was 14 (i'm 20 now!), so i can't tell you how cool it is to have gotten 462 of them for under [...] bucks! ^_^ i used to try to scrimp and save and only buy the ones that i thought were essentials, but now i have most of my favorites and tons more!yay, srini!update: after using the stickers for awhile, i discovered they are not so good at sticking. they usually peel up w/in an hour or so. it's great to have them, i just wish i didn't have to carry tape around when i want to use them."
2,Not so sticky,"The stickers have many great sayings, but they're not as sticky as ones I've bought at record shops and other places. In a collage of stickers gathered from many places, these were the only ones to peel up on their own (within two days)."
3,3 star review,"This book was not the best tool to use for studying the Praxis II. It helped to reorganize my thoughts and think about concepts I hadn't seen in a while. The book, however, gave no problem-solving practice and did not resemble the items on the test."
1,cheap chinese junk,"Received quick by Amazon. Box was fine and well packed. Speaker was in 3 pieces as stated by another reviewer. The center(speaker and center portion), the cone, and also separate, the back of cone attached to mounting bracket.The way this junk is designed, you have the bracket bolted to the back portion of the cone. A screw goes through the back portion and screws into the speaker magnet, and the speaker/internal center holds the cone against the backing section. Well, its WEAK point is on the plastic by the screw head. It was broken off. They dont mate flat together, theres a gap. This gap allowed too much pressure and the center of backing cap broke.Tried super glueing it. Same results, it breaks again. I will be going to the store to track down a longer screw and big washer, this will work for sure. Stress distribution is the key.Sounds 3/5 but i didnt expect more. Smaller than I was expecting. Cheap speaker to wire connection."
1,NOT good,"Got it and it came in 3 peices and could barley hear anything out of it.got to lazy and never sent it back but just a waste of money, could have just been the one i got, but just a heads up"
1,Not worth half the money,"The book is nothing but a collection of blunders. Here is a sample from Part II On page 22 author gives the complete commands for fdisk in almost one page without any explanation at all. As if that was not enough, the very next chapter repeats the same table - again without any explanations, but with one difference - most of the commands are bb - Edit the disk labelb - Toggles the DOD compatibility flagb - adds a new partitionb - Creates a new empty DOS partition tableb - quits without saving the changesb - Creates a new empty sun disklabel.This is probably the simpler of the mistakes, as the editor can be blamed for this. Throughout the book you will see mistakes simply because the Author himself has not understood the concept. Like mixing up between Partition table, boot record and superblock. It came as a surprise to me that many people gave good rating for this book. Frankly I suspect foulplay here. It could very well be the authors themselves."
1,Terrible!,"This book is filled with errors. I was going to be nice and give it 2 stars, until I read this on page 122 about vi --> ""Who wants to work with such an application when word processors such as Microsoft Word exist?"" Are you kidding me? Has the author ever even worked with Linux before? I've read over 20 Exam Cram/Prep books before and this is easily the worst one. Go buy O'Reilly's LPI in a Nutshell. It covers both exams in one book and is much much better than this."
1,Are you kidding,"The book is a non starter. It will be silly to beleive that this is all they ask for the exam. Because there is absolutely no solid information at all.Towards the end you will feel that the authors wrote this book while watching Jerry Springer show. They simply did not seemed to care about it anymore.Page 285 - The only information about Samba is a half page print out of the homepagePage 286 - 287 : unnecessary lengthy /etc/hosts file are printed 3 times. Page 282 : half page printout of homepageRight from the beginning, the book is crammed with serious mistakes.My estimate is that if the authors try hard for about 2 years, they will start to understand linux. Then they will have to spend another 5-7 years to become good in it. Only after that should they even think about teaching linux."
1,wonderful pack of mistakes,"Page # 236""A zombie is a process whose parent has terminated and cannot clear references to the child process""He even goes one more level and says...""chare 1870 1 7 17:25 ? 00:00:01 kwmThe output of ps indicates that the process is now a zombie and is owned by the init process""This clearly shows his ignorance about the basic definition of a zombie process. What else do you expect from someone whose only experience is clicking some silly microsoft buttons. Shame on you authors.It makes me so angry that some cheap MS guy managed to get guy 40$ from me for this useless book.By the way a zombie process is a process which is already dead ( and hence the name zombie ) , but whose parent is still alive, but has not yet asked for the process termination status. ( So the OS still keeps parts of the dead process' process table thinking that some time later the parent is going to ask for the status - wait system call. This results in the wastage of system resources )."
3,Loving Family Pendant,My wife was very pleased with this pendant but I don't feel that it exactly lived up to my expectatoins. From the online photo it looks like the entire pendant is a polished silver but in fact the inside of the pendant is more rough and not the smooth polished surface of the outside. Not a big deal but it would definitely have been nicer if the entire pendant was a polished silver.
5,Mother Child Charm Neclace,I just love this and I am sure our daughter-in-law will love it too at Christmas. We started our shopping early this year. It is a very unique design and seems to be great quality. I have not seen it other places. Perfect for a mother!
4,"Sweet and small, but lovely as well.","While the necklace is small as other reviewers have stated, and a little flatter than the photo reflects, it is still graceful and sweet and nice quality. I am overall pleased with the product and would order again if need arises."
4,should be shown in classrooms,"This is the only documentary I have ever seen on the historic Brown vs. education decision. As an educator, I think it should be shown in contemporary high school classrooms to help our students understand that it wasn't that long ago that racial prejudice was institutuionalized in this country, and what a struggle it was to even start to bring about change. This video is a little on the long side, but can be watched over several class periods. An excellent discussion started and educational tool for the high school classroom. Teachers of history, psychology, street law, and civics classes should seriously consider making this a part of their curiculum."
5,buy in target waaaaay cheaper,"Target is selling this same exact pack for $9.... i made the mistake of not listening to the user that posted it originally and i ended up overpaying by $11. I give the movies 5 stars, just dnt buy em through here."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Broderbund's Calendar Creator 12 could be a great product IF there was even minimal support, which there isn't! The program worked OK until Microsoft updated their .net framework this year and now the program won't start. It seems the only way this software is ever updated is with (guess what) - a NEW version! Which of course you can buy again. But I've decided this will be my last version (and it's my fifth!)."
2,Dare I say....,"that I found this ... well ... boring? I suppose, on the one hand, I should be glad that Ms. Wright had a relatively uneventful and happy life, despite growing up both black and disabled in the mid-20th century rural south; but, frankly, happy and uneventful lives don't make for very interesting reading."
2,"half way through, and may not finish","Susan Andersen is one of several authors whose books I buy automatically. After this, however, I will wait to read other reviews before I buy. I have thoroughly enjoyed her stories in the past, especially her suspense genre. I am half way through this book, refuse to give it up, but am already thinking about what I want to read next. Boring, boring, boring."
1,Impossible to understand,"I took Warren S. Warren's freshman chemistry course at Duke with this evil book. It is basically a list of equations. You will not be able to figure out the problems, and since there is no solutions manual or anything comparable, you will not find out how to do them, either, unless you are a brilliant, brilliant person, in which case you should definitely buy this book. Otherwise, stay away.This book is a summary of his lectures, and let me tell you, he is a terrible lecturer, so if you need this book for class, look forward to not knowing WTF is going on."
4,Slow Delivery& Pretty Banged Up,"Took a long time to get to me at school, but that seemed to be a general amazon trend. I saw the book and it was in pretty bad shape, although to be honest, I cannot remember if it sad good or like new. However, I still think good was a stretch..."
5,Teeter Hang Ups F5000 Inversion Table,Inversion table is as described. Is easy to set up and use. Well balanced and you feel secure. Padded ankle bar is a plus. It has helped with my lumbar spine.
2,In a word... Disappointing,"Don't mistake me, I loved most everything about this series-- the characters, the twists and turns of the story, even the music (bought all THREE CD's). But I hated how it ended. It just failed to tied together everything that has been going on in the story. I saw this version of the ending, as well as the one called ""Rebirth"" (where Shinji spends most of his time screaming-- yes, screaming). Genesis 0:13 doesn't explain certain images-- like Katsugari's and Ritsuko's corpses (you'll see that in ""Rebirth""). The Instrumentality Project sounds like pure BS. It merely accomplished what you'd hire a shrink for, so I was left wondering why they had to employ the Eva for it. Also you'll still be wondering how the ""Second Impact"" came about, where Yui Ikari is, what the point of SEELE was and what the Eva was really built for."
4,Best Lil Whorehouse In Texas,Loved the movie..brought back some great memories from watching it from way back..lol. I even bought it for a friend as a gift.
5,Worth it just for...,"Charles Durning - a spellblindingly brilliant turn as the Governor - that not only steals the show but fully deserves to mentioned in all those ""best moments from the movies"" polls. No matter how many times you'll watch him I guarantee that you'll wind up smiling everytime. Classic."
3,Just a good book,It doesn't contain all the admin stuff about Solaris one would like to know but is useful.
3,"Bought it, returned it.","Like another reviewer, I found that the headset jack was defective. This was 50% of my reason for buying the phone, so I returned it. Also, the sound quality was adequate, but not great. There was a constant background of white noise. I wish it had worked, because it combines some great features."
3,"Looks cool, but performance and features are weak","Range on this phone is somewhat disappointing... even just 50 feet away, I noticed dropouts and the occasional ""Out of Range"" indicator.The phone's microphone is way oversensitive, even holding it against my face would cause annoying feedback - there is also an excessive amount of background noise.The menus are a pain. Redialing is a 3 or 4 step process. It would have been nice if a dedicated ""redial"" button were included.For $100, you could probably do a lot better unless you're going on looks alone. In that respect, it's a great phone."
1,Hardly counts as cooking,"Nearly every recipe relies heavily on canned soup, processed cheese, bottled sauce, etc. Not my idea of home cooking. I'm donating this one to the library book sale."
3,no cd cover,"When I received the CD I ordered I was disappointed to see that it had no album cover or back. I have purchased this album before, when cassette tapes were cool, and it came with an album cover just like the one pictured for sale. I love Buck-O-Nine and so when I received my CD I was more than happy to open it up and listen to it, which is what I did. I would have returned it, because I do want an album cover with my CD, but I was too excited to hear this album again. Yet, it was a disappointment to open up my package and see a case with a CD and no cover or back."
1,"Cheaply made knife that rusts easily, made out of brittle steel....","I am stunned. Buck is suppose to be a top quality American made knife. However, the blade is brittle and noticed that there are little chips and notches in it already. (I didn't use it on anything hard or metal). Not only that, but it gets rusty VERY easily. I have hade to clean it with CLR two times already. I'm very dumbfounded overall, and will not be purchasing anymore Buck knives in the future."
1,Too big!,I had to return these because they were too big. They seemed strangely out of scale considering they're supposed to match the set. Beware since the creamer is more like a gravy boat and the sugar bowl is very large also.
3,Flush cut adapter,"Does the job, but tends to break due to design flaws that could be corrected by manufacturer. Breaks quickly and often. No better option that I know of though."
3,Jury still out,"Bought this device for removing baseboard. Blade plunge cut into the wall behind plus, I had to shave down some metal to properly retrofit the the blade to my reciprocal saw. I just don't know about this. It might be good for another purpose but, I am not quite sure."
5,Glad I found these,I don't know why these things are so hard to find in local stores but I am happy I found them here. I use these all the time and the extra larger size is not stocked in my neighborhood stores. They work and I am not about to change brands based on local availability. Keeps my floors looking great!
4,Good military science fiction,"I found this novel to be a page turner and difficult to put down. It kept me up pretty late for that reason. The story is told well, written well and paced to be exciting. I am happy to see that there is one more book in the series."
4,world needs to read this blog,i am very impressed with the articles and mix of humor. thank you for bringing this current issue to the people.
5,Great technical atlas for the urologic surgeon!,This book reaches almost all operative techniques in Urologic Surgery. It begins with basic principles and includes percutaneous and prosthetic urologic surgery . It's a good tool for students and residents or specialists looking for a fast review of almost every surgical procedure in the urology armamentarium.
2,Not the bargain you imagine,"The price compared to the bookstore is great, but after purchasing and taking to class I realize why. It's missing several chapters at the end of the book. The hardcover you find in bookstores has at least 3 or more chapters. If your class doesn't go that far, then you're good. If it does...well then you're going to have problems. Everything else is fine, but you will be missing key information."
4,Hornblower series,"Winston Churchill read the Hornblower series every two or three years. I am sure that, like Shakespeare, the series celebrates humanity - and the luck that sometimes accompanies bravery. The self doubt that any reasonable person has to battle from time to time rings true. Most people will see themselves at one time or another in his predicaments."
4,Bought the set,"After a friend gave me the first book in this series, I liked it so well I boughtthe entire set. (Some are out of print). I found it well worth the effort tofollow this engaging couple's adventures while living in Ireland."
3,They're ok...,"I bought these bags when I ran out of the Lansinoh ones because they looked easy to pour from. They are a little easier, but the plastic is very stiff and cheap feeling and they smell very plastic-y too. I only used a couple then went back to Lansinoh."
5,Great buy!,These bags are easy to use - just open the ziploc. They are convenient - they stand on their own and take up very little room in the freezer. I've been using 3 of them per day for 4 months and only one has had a leak.
1,I wouldn't buy again,"I have the First years breatpump and bottles however these bags are a bad product. I have had several break/rip when trying to open to store milk, several I didn't realize te zip lock didn't seal and lost all te milk when it slowly spilled out. They are a cheap quality feel and had to poor from. I will not buy these again."
5,great bags. fantastic standing feature,These are great little bags at a great price. The best feature is that they actaully stand up making it very easy to pour your milk into them and very easy to measure out your milk. I had no issues with them leaking or coming open or anything. The storage system for these bags works with all bags and I have to say its pretty fantastic too.

5,An Amazing Man!!!,"While his younger Brother Medgar gets more attention. This man is a Mississippi legend as well. He is not afraid to admit his vices, his faults, and his triumphs. He is a college grad, fighter, ladies man, pimp, Civil rights Leader, Politician, a man who although he follows non-violence, is not afraid to confront White Racists or African-Americans he disagrees with. It is a interesting life story."
3,Not bad,"I am an intermediate - advanced fingerpicker.I purchased this book after going through ""fingerpicking guitar licks"" by the same author (still cant play pineapple rag properly). This is not the same type of book. Where ""licks"" provides progressive incremental little ditties before tossing you onto a song, this book is really a ""here is some nice tab to play"" book. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the style of fingerpicking that this book and the author represents. Dont expect this book to contain lessons as in ""fingerpicking guitar licks""."
3,~*An o.k. book*~,"I had to read this book for a banned book assignment, but I probably should have read something like Go Ask Alice instead. ""Izzy, Willy-Nilly"" was sorta exciting in the beginning when she describes the car crash, but after that point it gets pretty depressing and boring. This book was thought-provoking though, that's for sure. I mean, what would I be like if I lost a whole leg?!The teen characters' dialog don't really seem like something I, a 14-year-old, would say. BUT, it does show how even though your ""friends"" might leave you cuz you're disabled, you can still have a great shoulder to lean on (literally), sometimes whom you'd least expect (in this case non-pretty & non-glamorous and smartie Rosamunde). AND, if you are disabled, if people really know you, they won't even realize the crutches. =)"
3,A different book,"I thought this book was very different from the ones I've read in the past. When i finished the book, I thought to myself: that was a really good book. Then, about a day later when I had time to reflect on it I thought differently. This book was about a teenager who loses pratically everything becasue of a drunk driver. She doesn't achive much and all she really does is cry about things. I thought the real person in the book was Rosamunde-her new friend-. She decided to help Izzy who was a brat. I wouldn't have done that. But- the reason that i'm not giving this book 1 star is because this book taught how disabled people really may feel, so now I won't stare or feel sorry for the person, I will just ignore there disablility."
1,What was the point of this book???,"I had to read this book for summer reading and found that it was really BAD. Izzy went on a date with a senior who she didn't really like and then went home with him even though he was drunk. She got in an accident and lost her leg. Abandoned by her ""friends"" she befriended an ""odd"" girl named Rosamunde who she'd never really liked before. Izzy was too absorbed in being liked and ""nice"" and I didn't understand why she would't take a ride home with the guy she had a crush on when he offered. I thought that the Izzy in her head that did cartwheels that she was always mentioning made no sense. I found the parts where Izzy was in the hospital really boring, and her parents bugged me. Instead of being happy that she'd made a friend who visited her and kept her happy, her mom was worried that Rosamunde wasn't Izzy's type. The story had no heart... it didn't make me like the characters, it didn't make me happy, it didn't make me sad, it was just boring."
3,Realistic but slow paced,"I just finished reading this book and I found it to be a very realistic portrayal of the vast majority of teens attitudes today. The main character Izzy suffers a terrible injury at the hands of a drunk driver. After the injury Izzy's ""true"" friends can hardly stand to be around her. They move on with their lives and show more compassion for the drunk driver than they do for her. The book does a good job of illustrating just how tough life is after a traumatic injury. The book also does a good job of showing what real frienships are all about when it delves into the relationship between Izzy and Rosalmunde. My only complaint with the book is that it tends to drag in spots. The end of the book was rather well written. I would strongly suggest this book to high school aged kids because I think it does a good job of illustrating the dangers associated with drinking and driving."
4,All Wilson footballs made in Ohio???,"The video on you tube showing footballs being made does not say all footballs with Wilson on them are made in Ada, Ohio. He says all game footballs are made there. This ball is a decent little football but it is not leather as described. Otherwise, it is a replica of ""The Duke"" and is fun to throw around with little guys."
3,It was okay.,"I watched a show and the owner said that all the footballs were made and processed in Ohio, and that he would never outsource jobs. I was shocked when I saw that the ball said, ""Made in China."" Other than that, it's a nifty little football."
1,old and incomplete,This is an out dated book {1998}and was not helpful at all. I live in Northwest Houston and this book did not even list what is a well established private school with over 500 students that is in my area. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone looking for a private school if they want current and acurate information. It is a rip-off.
4,excellent LA PI story,"i found this one by accident in a used book store, never read anything by arthur lyons before. enjoyed it tremendously! people who like hard boiled detective stories, especially ones set in LA, will probably enjoy this. i'm now looking for other arthur lyons stories but they are almost all out of print."
1,The user reviews tell a story...,"I just wish I had read the reviews before installing this product.I installed this product when I realised that my DSL connection had to a number of trojan horses on my system and a slew of hacker attacks. I downloaded a 'free' 30-days trial version and installed this. I had a tough time having it installed properly to work with my DSL....and THEN the nightmares began.A few days into the trial, annoying pop-up windows start appearing every so often asking if you'd want to purchase it! (Why the hell do you call it a ""30-day"" evaluation??). It irritated me so much that I decided to uninstall the program. And I did the ""mistake"" of using the Windows 'Add/Remove Program"" to install this. That screwed up my Network and Dial up connections, got all kinds of winsock error. I'm still stuck and now I'm told I'll have to uninstall and re-install the network drivers.Just don't buy (or even try) this product!!"
5,Sherlock the legend,"I love Sherlock holmes since i was in 6th grade.. English class. Once i saw this figure and the rest of the reviews i had to have it!, Ive read plenty of sherlock holmes novels and still do. Mr. Holmes standing with his Pipe next to my Mac, Great figure for a collector not for play."
5,Lot's of fun for Daddy's little helper!,My 4 year old has had this for about 2 years. It is still going strong and he loves it! The weed trimmer sound is great and the swirling lights on the bottom simulating the string are really cool! The little light bar also stops easily when small fingers get ahold of it. This is also also a really great gift.
1,failed to proivide correct product or refund,I ordered a replacement battery for my portable phone. The product sent to me was the wrong size and for a different company's phone. I emailed the company and received a single email asking for more information and have not heard back from them despite additional emails directly to them and separately through the Amazon mechanism for having received a wrong product.
3,Not in love with this one.,"This writer makes it somewhat more difficult to get through the book easily.It keeps jumping back in time and takes awhile to get to the point throughout the story. I did finish reading it, but sometimes wanted to just toss it down."
1,Exploded in my purse and ruined smartphone!,"One of these pens exploded in my purse and got all over my white Blackberry. The ink is impossible to remove. I could have traded my phone in or sold it for about $200 and was getting ready to do so when this happened. Now my phone is worthless. Thanks, Bic!"
5,An Old Favorite,"Everyone knows these pens.I grew up using them, and the blue and black were always around the house. Remember when they were spelled Crystal instead of Cristal? A friend of mine used to carry a red one with her wherever she went. We always wanted green but they weren't sold around here. I always notice these pens when they show up in movies or tv shows, too. In Sixteen Candles, Samantha throws one at her brother, and also uses one to take a quiz.Yes well the pens are still basically the same as always. They write the same. I noticed a long time ago that the more you use it, the better it seems to write. I'm not sure if that's true with the new pack I bought, because I've only just started using one of them. But that's how they used to be. As the ink gets near the middle part, the pen writes smoother. It was always fun to see the ink go down. Oh, the nerdy joys of pen collecting."
1,AAAAAH...I CAN'T BELIEVE I BOUGHT A CASSETE PLAYER FOR THIS,"ok, i think maybe a 12 year old may benefit from this tape. this whole freaking tape was common sense just about. i learned one thing in this whole tape. i don't think the other reviewers were reviewing the same thing. there is nothing good about this tape. please believe me and dont get it please."
3,"Not the best, but has some nuggets","This book outlines, in excruciating detail, how to manage basic point and figure charts. The only part of the book that can't be found on the internet contains subjects on optimizing the charts and recent (ca. 1994-97) analyses of profitability of the charts.Read Dorsey first (Point and Figure Charting), and if you want to really get deep, read the last couple chapters of this book."
3,Light reading,"This is the first in a series of murder mysteries written by Rhys Bowen. Constable Evans is a policeman living and working in North Wales. The author knows this part of the world very well, and writes in the style of Agatha Christie. This book served me very well as light reading while travelling. Rhys Bowen has also written another series of murder mysteries with an Irish heroine by name of Molly Murphy. Both of these series are very well worth while."
2,Hamish??,"When I started reading this book, I was aghast at how similar--nearly identical it is to the Hamish Macbeth series by MC Beaton, which I adore. And that's the problem.I spent the entire time reading this book comparing it--unfavorably--to the HM series. I saw that the Evan Evans series began in December of 1998, while the Macbeth series began publishing in Feb of 1999, so it's not as though MC Beaton saw this book and feverishly began working on copying it.MC Beaton's Macbeth series is just more humorous, the characters have more depth to them.This book was ok. Probably won't continue on in the series."
2,untitled,"The title is misleading, the tricks presented are very elaborate, require too many props. Althought some people may enjoy them it was not what I was looking for."
5,The Best Six Sigma Book I've Read,"I am writing to congratulate you for your outstanding work on the book you have written about the Six Sigma Business Scorecard. I have spent the past week reading it, and I've realized what a fantastic tool it is.I am a Six Sigma Intern, and I work at Recofarma, a Concentrate Plant of the Coca Cola Company, located in Manaus, Amazonas - Brazil. I was trying to create a Massive Communication Plan for Six Sigma within the company and one of my ideas was to create a Scorecard for Six Sigma, then I looked for related material at Amazon.com and your book appeared on the top of the list. It surely was a great investment."
5,possibly the MOST uplifting Science Fiction I've read EVER!,"Being a long-time sci-fi fan, I was totally unprepared forthe world that David Brin writes about in Earth. Having readquite a few shoot-em-ups in space and the *life will just belike living in a garbage can* depictions of the future -- Iwas stunned by the intricacies of this book.The ending will ABSOLUTELY blow your mind -- it did mine!"
1,Pretty much unreadable,"This is a horrible mashup of a somewhat interesting but very standard SF novel about a team of scientists attempting to deal with a black hole that threatens to consume the Earth, and a whole lot of gibberish about Gaia, ridiculous social changes, and heavy moralizing about what humans have done to the planet. Although I have very much enjoyed Brin's Startide novels, it took me three tries years apart to get through this thing. It got easier after I learned to just skim ahead and skip all the parts not directly related to the black hole."
1,Not Worth the Effort,"I really did not like this book. The end was good, but the long slog to get there wasn't worth it. The POV jumps all over, with many characters existing solely to express the author's pontifications. I had no problem with the science, and enjoyed the extrapolation of the future from the culture of the late 80s. The expansive growth of the internet is just about spot on, but then he ruins the effect by creating new swear words for his characters to use. They just sounded silly. Most of this book seemed to go nowhere and have no point. The plot gets lost amid the countless warnings and philosophical statements of the author. Characters feel like vehicles for the author's opinion, not real people. It got old, fast. I can't recommend this book."
2,"Vaguely interesting, but too long","After 200 pages or so I put the book down. The parallel stories were plausible, the future Earth was well developed, but it just felt like my time would be better spent reading other books. The characters weren't engaging and the book is just too long, so it felt more like a chore to read it than a pleasure."
1,Earth,"The story is fine, just as I remembered it. However the readers do a horrible New Zealand accent, makes us sound as if we come from the Australian shores. Not only that but they just mangle the Maori pronunciation. Spoils what would be a world first, Tangata Whenua as protagonists in a a Science Fiction novel"
5,HEAVY,"I know that a book has affected me when its ideas keep popping up in my conversations. Earth is one of those books, because it covers so many issues that I consider to be hot topics: privacy, the information super-highway, restrictions in scientific research, evolution of consciousness and the future of the entire human race.I read a couple of reviews here criticizing the shallow characterizations, but all of the characters seemed like real people to me. It has a great villain you'll love to hate, and loads of intelligent people having intelligent conversations.If you don't like books that jump back and forth between several sets of characters and plots, then you won't like Earth. I happen to enjoy this format, to see how the various people and situations merge in a grand finale; and believe me, this book has a heck of a grand finale!"
2,An aged singularity potboiler,"This book hasn't aged well; it has been a long seventeen years and the technical and ecological references are quaint (where not obsolete). The ostentatious earnestness of the ecological message of book can be tiresome: I found myself muttering ""yes, yes, I got it, yes, now get on with the story."" Oh yeah, the story: the ""oops, I dropped the black hole"" plot has been done many times since, so this book has had a certain influence: Paul McAuley's ""How We Lost the Moon"" and Bill DeSmedt'sSingularity. From a technical standpoint, read McAuley. Skip this one, unless you enjoy mystical preaching about the environment, with dated arguments."
4,Makes You Wonder!,"This book was entertaining and thought provoking. The premise was unusual. The sci fi elements were pretty well explained and seemed believable for the most part. Mostly though, I liked the morality issues which seemed to weave their way throughout the story. The different shades of right and wrong in all the hues of gray! The author provided 'food for thought' and made me re-examine some of my own basic beliefs in the process. While enjoying an entertaining and scarey story I was also able to flex my imagination regarding our planet and some of the social aspects of our existence as a species. Recommended!"
4,I'll read more Brin!!,"I hadn't read anyhthing by Brin before, when I saw EARTH at the library, I judged it by its cover. It turned out to be a great story with well developed, thoughtful characters. The end was not too ""out there"" (just barely) but he made it sound plausible. I was very happy he didn't end it on some cliche ominous note. I liked his vision of our future. I'll enjoy being a little old man there. My only wish was that, in a book this long, he had included a list of characters to refer back to."
2,"Nice, but some safety issues.","I like the size and power of this smaller unit, but have a couple of concerns, strong enough that I returned it to the store. The chute for continuous feed is too low and it would be very difficult to get a bowl of any size underneath it. Also the lid easily popped out of the safety lock that is required to run the machine. Do not know it this is a machine feature or a defect on the one I tried. Hope this helps someone."
4,Whistful Christmas DVD,"I saw this movie on TV and decided to buy it for next year. I get a longing at holiday time for happy endings, so this DVD just fit the bill. Next year I will enjoy the movie, knowing that I have a copy and don't have to wait for it to come on the TV. For others who want a copy of favorite shows, I would recommend it."
5,Call me Mrs. Mircle,The second part of this movie is move than excellent to be watched. Time is worth watching this again and again and watched at least more than ten times
1,Internet Guard Dog Pro,Stay away from this product. It took my Microsoft Internet Browser 5.5 hostage. I had to format my Hard Drive. I also tried the Office 2000 version and the same. MaAfee has no patch available to solve this issue. They are claiming that upgrading to version 3.12 will work- I wouldn't take the chance for the third time....
2,disappointment,"I came across this book in the library and while it was an enjoyable and somewhat informative read, I was sorely disappointed when I tried two dessert recipes--Lime Custard and Orange Tuiles. The measurements given didn't seem quite right to me but I followed the recipes to the letter anyway. It wasn't a case of the recipes just not quite working or simply not tasting all that good. They failed miserably; the custard tasted awful and the batter for the tuiles was way too thin.I couldn't help but question the accuracy of these recipes from the outset simply because most chefs of the caliber/type in this book oftentimes can't give you exact measurements for their dishes. Also, why would they want to give away their trade secrets?In the end I'm left with the sense that this book is more style than substance and I'm so glad I didn't shell out any money for it."
3,Good product,"The ""Ace"" knee support is very good. ""Ace"" however needs to be more informative as to sizes. Rather than sml, med, lrg they should specify a ""range of dimensions of what it will best fit."
2,It is really a narrow view,"Regards Obi divination this book offer a narrow view of this theme. The introduction is well done, with myths about obi, however there is few information about how to use this powerfull oracle. It doesn't explore the nine positions, the segments position in opon and also the Odu asnpect. In despite of Obi Oracle is not for cast Ifa as we do with opele and not for we speak through òrúnmìlà the Odu messages and orientation is an olodumare tool and for this reason is allways present and usefull and Obi can be used as an Oracle for we talk with the Ori and Orixá and receive consistent information and orientation for our lives, avoiding to handle with expensive Ifa works. One can find here some useful information when he wants to work with a Orixá oriented Oracle, which is, in fact, very comom. But be advised for the lack of information for understand the Obi Oracle."
3,Good for engineers starting the career,"The book is a mix of economical and technical aspects of chemical engineering design; so is good for graduates starting the career or for practicing engineer interested in economical aspects of plant design. For me the good companion book for these engineer is ""Conceptual design of chemical processes"" by J. Douglas or better but out-of-print ""Applied Project Engineering and Management"" by E. Ludwig."
4,"if this is my neighbor, let's HOOTENANNY every saturday night!","This is a fantastic disc. I don't notice any parts that sounds as bad as my neighbour as the first reviewer apparently heard. This is of the highest quality throughout. Now it is one man with a very good voice singing with only his acoustic guitar for most of it, but I don't find it much different from his quality recordings of the 50's. This is old-time cowboy music at it's finest. It compared with the legends of the 40's that I was familiar with, like Bob Wills, Sons of the Pioneers and Gene Autry. Not a big band like Wills, no harmonies like the Sons, but outstanding music nonetheless. If that is what you like, this disc is dynamite. Almost of the songs are written by Snow, and they stand up to other greats of the time in my opinion. If you read this far, you should definitely buy it! 4 1/2 stars, just a notch below the aforementioned legends."
2,Not as good as the real thing,"I bought this CD expecting something very similar to an original cast recording. However this CD has little to no resemblance to the offical soundtrack. The lyrics are the same, and the vocals are somewhat similar to the real thing, but instrumentally this CD is lacking. It sounds like the CD was put together using a keyboard. However, for someone not quite as picky as I am this is a great listen, the words are moving and the music, though not holding to Webber's original score, is good."
2,"dated, not sensual at all...","A lovely cover. Promising even. Then the 'essays'. I couldn't tell one from the other as the message was the same and, after the first two essays, thanks Midori, I got the message and felt no desire to read any further. The book was somewhat amusing, not educational as Midori wrote of things we can figure out without her input. I found it a ;et down. With the title beginning ""Wild Side Sex:', I found no wild side sex at all. There are much better books on this topic than this one."
1,"Another terrible book, like Osterbrock","This is another of the books I had to use for my graduate ISM course. I dont know what the problem is, but every book Ive read on the ISM was terrible at explaining things (because confusion in this subject is very easy), and none of them have an INDEX thats worth a crap. So dont expect to be able to do the homework problems in there.Dopita is written a little better than Osterbrock, and there isnt the ridiculous amount of tables strewn within the text, but its not MUCH better."
3,NO BLACKMORE,"I BROUGHT THIS CD A FEW YEARS AGO FOR $50.WAS REALLY UPSET, NO RICHIE PLAYING.HOWEVER YOU DO HEAR WHERE HE GOT SOME OF HIS IDEAS FROMNOT BAD CD BUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO BLACKMORE"
3,bittersweet honey of a tale,"Soinbhe has created a readable, interesting alegorical tale for young readers in A HIVE FOR THE HONEYBEE. She uses the social structure of bee society as a mirror image of our own, though it is a stretch to identify with insects that are ""hardwired"" to perform their alotted tasks. At any rate, the book blends fact and fiction seemlessly into a bittersweet tale that provides both fantasy and information, not an easy accomplishment. A fun read with marvelous illustrations, but WATERSHIP DOWN stands alone as the champion of animal alegorical tales and social satire."
1,Reduces signal power; isn't worth a cent.,Splitter reduces the signal power of the audio feed and cannot keep up with high quailty signals. When connected to a blu-ray player at 5.1 DTS the audio was very choppy; intensity of the optical coming out of the splitter was half that of directly out of the cable. Would not recommend for high quality audio.
1,Doesn't work,I figured for the cost it was worth a try to see if this would actually work. I plugged both my DirecTV box and Blu Ray player into this device and then into my Onkyo receiever. I could only get 1 of the devices to work no matter what I tried.I first turned on the DirecTV box on along with the receiver and the sound worked fine. I then turned off the DirecTV box and turned on the Blu Ray player and no sound at all coming from my receiver.I reversed the way the inputs were plugged in and now the Blu Ray player gives me sound but the DirecTV box doesn't. Seems as if only one input gives me sound.I emailed the vendor and they were nice enough to send me a replacement and it worked the same way.
3,Decent comedy flick,"Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan make a decent pair in this movie, and I was happy to see several familiar faces from oher places (such as the actress who played Ann in 'Parks and Recreation' It has some funny parts, and is fairly decent for a cop movie. The characters are all-around likeable, and Tracy Morgan's paranoid character feels to me like a commentary about today's society where so many people are lax about adultery, I could see his concerns and insecurity especially when some of his wife's actions seemed suspicious. I also liked the other character and how he wanted to do the right thing for his daughter. Overall a fun flick, 3.5/5 stars."
1,Waste of time and money,I am a Bruce Willis fan but this movie was full of bad acting and crass language. I'm sure it might appeal to teenage boys who love bathroom language but not to the rest of us.
1,CopOut,"This movie was a disappointment and really not a star on Bruce Willis's cap. The script is shallow, acting hollow, and a waste of time and money. Seemed to be a study of how many people would assume Bruce was up to par to have their pockets picked."
2,Cop Out,"I like buddy cop movies,that's why I wanted to see this one but it was so bad.Pretty boring and not very funny.I did like the scene where Tracy Morgan did that line from Robo Cop in the begining but that's about it.Sean William Scott wasn't that funny in this movie either.I thought he was annyoing.I bet Bruce Willis didn't like Tracy Morgan in real life,not just in the movie.Never will I see anthor movie with Tracy Morgan again.They should have paired Bruce Willis up with someone else.Don't even watch this movie for free!"
1,A.K.A. Throw Out,"I was surprised that Bruce actually did this movie, I guess all movie stars have at least one bad movie in their pocket.This movie was poorly written, it was just full of bad words and this is it. The only good addition to the film was Sean William Scott. He brought comedy to which the movie needed but it was still trash and not worth my $2."
4,It's so so,"This movie has it's pros and cons. More cons than pros. Most of the jokes fall flat, and it feels like Bruce Willis phoned in the entire movie. But still an enjoyable movie."
2,Cop Out,"I think we might like it but we were unable watch all of it because halfway into the movie the sound does not match up with the person talking, drove us crazy."
2,So-So,"It got my attention at first, but only because it screamed Lethal Weapon. Unlike Lethal Weapon, it wasn't endearing and I think they tried to hard to make the characters look like Riggs and Murtaugh, but without the charm.It's hardly the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's far from the best. I can see why the cable company gave it one star."
4,The Brat Pack Review,"These films are my all time favorites and I was glad to see a collection for purchase. The only thing that bothered me was the sound quality. I don't know if it was my television or those movies, but I had to keep turning up and down my volume. It really seemed like it was the movies. The one that was most noticable was, The Breakfast Club. I think it is still worth purchasing this collection versus buying them separately. It is more cost effective this way."
3,No Pretty in Pink?,"I bought this on a whim when it was on sale because I always enjoyed the John Hughes movies with Molly Ringwald. Admittedly I'd never seen Weird Science. It doesn't deserve to be in the same box as Sixteen Candles & Breakfast Club. I don't think a Sixteen Candles/Breakfast Club/Pretty in Pink combo exists, but I might be wrong. I did appreciate the way these movies were packaged so much that I went out & cut up a copy of Pretty in Pink to create my own John Hughes quadfecta."
2,We want special features!!!!!,"Yeah ok, so Sixteen Candles has the original soundtrack, while that is a very good reason to buy this re-issued DVD, it's not good enough! I have both 16 Candles and The Breakfast Club on DVD from it's first release and I will hold on to them until Universal releases a special edition! I want a REUNION commentary, featurette, deleted scenes, alternate scenes, outtakes, videos etc! Until then I am not spending more money on these dvds. I'm hoping when the 20th anniversary rolls around we'll get something worthy."
2,Weird Science?,"Pretty in Pink should have been bundled with this set, NOT Weird Science!Stick to the theme, people!Weird Science would have been more appropriately-bundled with a film such as, Zapped!Also, where are all the special features?"
4,Super!!!,"I not only received the items, within a few days, but the movies were in great condition. The only thing was the case, it had a small dent to the bottom of the package, but no biggy. The movies were still greatly visable. Thanks again."
2,The prequel is better...,"Once again we meet Courtney Von Dragen Smith, who's all grown up and entering college...in Wisconsin?! Courtney is a likable character, and is shows in this diary of her first semester. However, I read Truth or Dairy (the prequel) earlier this year, and even I couldn't remember who some of the characters were she constantly mentions. It would have been nice if the author had woven in a quick explanation of who Jane and Beth were just to refresh our memories. I felt like this book could have been MUCH better, but instead, the characters are so thinly drawn that you never care much about them."
2,Turned off by non-stick surface,I was excited to order this product at a great price. I liked that it was all stainless steel. I ended up quite dismayed that the interior was non-stick. It was very strange--non of the advertising or manuals mentioned it at all. I contacted Fagor and they said it shouldn't be non-stick. So I got Amazon to send another one. It was non-stick too. So I returned it for a refund.
4,Good pot,"Seemed like it didn't work at first, but then it worked fine. Very nice and roomy. Doesn't seem to cook beans as quickly as my old noisy pressure cooker though, and I am worried about the pop up button melting over time though as some other reviewers have mentioned."
1,Won't build pressure,"I have owned two other pressure cookers, so I have some experience with them. It appears well made. The only indication that it's reached full pressure is the small yellow button that (silently) pops up. That's when one is supposed to start the cooking time for that meal. If you're not there to witness the event, then cooking time will be off. I've tried to cook with it about 10 times and could only get a proper seal and pressure twice or so. I reviewed the manual, the trouble-shooting guides and still come up with a plain ole' regular pot. When I was in a pinch for time, I was left with a hungry family. It's a beautiful pot, but just too much of a hassle to use, and too unreliable when on a tight schedule."
5,I'm very happy,"I must be one of the lucky ones who actually received the product I ordered. I've been researching pressure cookers for a while and I've found this model to be top of the line of second level pressure cookers. The first line being Kuhn Rikon, WMF, Fissler and similar models. I've done mostly stocks, bolognese, and baked beans so far and have not had any difficulty. The aluminum disk at the bottom aids browning. Pressure cooking is safe if you know what you're doing so make sure you read the instruction manual and make sure you hit Miss Vickies website for recipes and additional safety information."
1,Piece of junk!,"The first one of these we received was completely broken in transit. So we sent it back and got a replacement. So we tried using the new one, and guess what. The top would not seal and the meal was totally burned. Wow. I paid HOW much for this? This is totally pathetic. THis piece of *&%#$ is so poorly made that it can not possibly work. DO NOT BUY THIS. It is cheap junk."
5,So much nicer than my old Mirro!,"No ""jiggler"" noise like the old unit I had, just a soft hiss of steam escaping. Has 2 pressures (8 and 12 pounds), versus the old 5, 10 or 15 of the Mirro. Potatoes cook quicker, dried beans are a snap! Easy to clean, plus it looks really modern and snazzy. ;-)"
4,fast faster fastest,i bought this cooker because i wanted to save a little time and I've always heard pressure cookers are the real deal. well... this Fagor 8qt pressure cooker is the real deal. Its fast and efficient i've used it 3 times(thanks to miss Vickies cookbook)and it is top notch. I cooked about 8 russets last night for mashed potatoes 14 minutes... i would have given it 5 stars but the handle on the steaming basket pooped off when i tried to take it out of the cooker after things had cooled down. easy to fix with a pair of pliers by adding some more bend to the ends but I shouldnt have to do that... oh well its still a great deal I am looking forward to making many more delicious dinners in record time.~X~
5,Fagor Pressure Cooker,"I am areal cook,and was afraid to try a pressure cooker.After reading your online reviews I ordered the 8 Quart Fagor pressure cooker.I ordered this item primarily to make chicken soup.It is easy to use and performs beautifully!!!"
5,"A good unit - well designed, does a great job","I had purchased a Cuisinart electric pressure cooker, which I did not like - you can read my review under that product. I returned it and bought this one, which I like much better. No problematic electronics, larger capacity but smaller and lighter - easier to store and less $$$.It's easy to use, cooks enough for leftovers - which will get eaten! Pressure cooked food is easy, fast and tasty.This one is simple to use and has a good capacity - you can only fill a pressure cooker to around 60% of capacity, so a 10 qt. cooker can make around 6 qts.You do have to wait for it to get up to pressure before turning on the timer - you don't go off and leave these things. But the results are great, some of the best food I've ever made.If you want to try pressure cooking, this is good unit."
1,Review of Praxix High School Social Science,"This book contains one practice exam based on the author's overview of all the social sciences. While reviewing my answers, I discovered a few errors on the answer sheet. I lost confidence in the book, and stopped using it."
3,Decent,"The bench is decent, I can't say its a sweet deal but for the amount of money you are paying, I guess you aren't being ripped off either. there is no installation manual so you have to put it together based on the exploded diagram. also the way the machine is made, for those people of shorter stature, the back and bottom are very uncomfortable. The straps dont come down very far and when you try to do tricep exercises, its easy to hit your head. on the positive side, even though it is uncomfortable, this machine does give you a good ab/tri workout."
5,You Won't Be Sorry with this Book,"This book is great.I've been reading (and making) Ms. Tribole's Recipe Makeover column in Shape magazine for years--and have always enjoyed the results. She doesn't dissapoint, with both great-tasting recipes and practical tips that you can start using today. I also like the fact that you don't have to run out to a special store for ingredients--you can start eating healthy just from your local grocery store."
2,"Healthy, yes; simple, no.","The recipes in this book are healthy but they are not neccessarily easy or quick to prepare. If you are cooking for others they may be fooled by the ""sneak"" ingredients but after all the shopping, chopping, & measuring entailed in preparing these dishes, the cook sure won't be fooled. Many recipes are very difficult to prepare without a food processor and some ingredients are not to be found in the average grocery store. I was hoping for recipes that required less preparation & simpler ingredients. The book was not a total dissappointment; the recipes were tasty but if you are looking for shortcuts to good nutrition, look elsewhere."
3,"A good, but not great book.","I read the authors earlier system admnistration books. They were helpful in preparing me for certification years ago. There weren't a lot of test prep manuals back then since Solaris had not appeared on the manual publishers radar screen. They gave me the basic information required to pass the certification test, I did however supplement the book along the way. I did the same with the Solaris 8 book. Since I have been a Solaris administrator for a couple of years I only needed something to highlight the differences. Don't expect a great amount of detail but it is a good book as an overview of the subject."
2,Ugh,"So far, I am not impressed by the CBC Lecture series. I haven't read every book, but so far all I have read have been painfully pretentious. They thrash around facts, but don't tie them well together. They end up sounding silly, pompous, and in the final analysis, fail even be fascinating.This book falls into these pitfalls. It thrashes around a lot, and drops a lot of thoughts, but fails to be compelling or unique."
1,`Ole Jimbo is Right Folks!,"I agree with the previous reviewer--this just stinks. I'd rather be forced to watch the movie ""Ice-Cream Man"" over and over again until everyone was about to commit suicide except for me. Then they'd say ""How can you take it!"" and I'd reply ""I listened to the Toronto Musical Review play selections from Rocky Horrow... I can take ANYTHING!"""
2,Much Dissappointment!!,"I enjoy using this website to buy toys especially because ofthe reviews that I find are a big help. This is the first toy in 5 yrs. of being a Mom, that dissappointed us so much, I had to write in. My son wanted this for Christmas, and he hashardly touched it.. It falls apart everytime we move it, it looks like so much more fun on TV! My husband and I laugh now, every time we see an ad for it, because we think it's a piece of garbage! It's collecting dust in the toy room, and I will donate it to Good Will my next trip..Neither of my sons have any interest in it at all!"
1,junk,"My son BEGGED for this toy, only to bring it home and find it completely boring. It is a complete piece of junk, not worth the ..., or even on sale for .... It looked so much more exciting on the commercial!"
5,Fun time,"My son wanted this for his 4th birthday and after reading the reviews I was a bit skeptical but we are very satisfied with the toy. I don't seem to have as many complaints as some of the other reviewers. Assembly was a bit annoying, had a hard time getting one piece on and the decals where annoying to place - put them on before you assemble. Our set seems to stay together just fine. He loves waiting to see if the shark will catch his car. (The shark doesn't catch a car every time) The sayings make him crack up. I see that it is selling for $56 I did not pay that much; that is a bit pricey for this toy."
5,Fantastic Present for a 6-year-old!,"I read reviews of this toy stating that it fell apart easily or was difficult to assemble. I disagree!! Sure, an adult should put it together, but if your child is anything like my son, he'll take it apart and put it together himself time and time again. He ""helped"" me put it together, and he can slip the large pieces apart and back together when he wants to move it to another room. Just about all of his cars fit the toy just fine, including his Bakugan! He loves watching to see which car gets eaten by the shark. Since the shark is mechanical, not electronic, the batteries and sound don't need to be on to play with it.And the shark sounds have an off switch!! Yay!"
1,Not Happy!,"This was bought as a gift and I hate it. I used it only a few times because the contents mix with the other slots, so you have no idea how much formula your putting into the bottle."
2,Hard to get formula out,"The lid is almost flat, so getting all the formula out of the spout requires a lot of shaking. I've spilled a bunch of powder on more than one occasion. We have a Munchkin one that has a more tapered spout that is much easier to get the formula out of.Also, this is a cup with a 3-compartment insert. This makes it more annoying to wash since you have to take it apart and basically have another cup to wash. Then you have to squeeze the insert back into the outer container pretty hard to start using it again.We're going to throw this one away and get another Munchkin one."
3,Better to be used as a snack cup,I bought this as a formula dispenser but I think it will serve better as a snack cup. It does not hold enough formula if I am going out on a one day trip or so. Moreover formula doesnt easily come out of the opening. You have to shake it 5-6 times. But I found it helpful coz I can mix formula and cereal in one compartment and use it while we're outside. and we need not carry the cereal tub separately.
5,Very helpful while out and about,"I have used this dispenser a lot while taking my baby out. Three compartments are independent from each other and contents do not mix between the compartments. The item can be sterilized (we have Avent steam sterilizer and it is helpful). I have read that some customers have difficulty taking the powder out, but it was quite easy for me - I turn the piece upside down and knock it onto the bottle couple of times to empty the compartment.. It seems it will be quite handy to store snacks later on, so definitely a useful item in a diaper bag :)"
2,Some bad horsies get C's in class,"I don't totally buy into the vintage thing, but this pedal sounds way too digital. Has none of the percussive qualities of the intro model Dunlop Crybaby. However, it seems ultra sensitive, great for that underwater sound that comes with quick foot movement on the pedal. I kept the Bad Horsie 2 for about five days to give it a chance, then ended up returning it.There was a little glue strip along the top of the foot switch that attracted a bunch of hairs and dust. Hard to clean off.I play guitar and bass, and although the product description reads that the Bad Horsie is useable with bass and keyboard, I thought it sounded terrible on my bass. My Boss ME 50B has way better wah capabilities, and a stand-alone pedal should beat out a multi-effects pedal."
3,soso,This item is very good.The system of automatically off when I remove my foot is useful.But the middle-low range sound is week.And the high range sound is too harsh.So you have to operate this exquisitely.
5,Stunning Compendium,"For once you can judge a book by its cover: both are stunning! I know of no other scholar who has so magically wedded a meticulous eye with a continual consideration for the lay reader. Reading this book you feel the presence of an author who truly loves the Classical World, in its broadest sense: encompassing literature, history, philosophy, and sociology. Whether you've always loved the classics or always hated them, I urge you to read this book."
2,Could have been better,"Whilst I concede the Mr Leckie's prose style is easily-paced and therefore Hannibal is the kind of book you could probably read in a single afternoon, all this book really achieves is to prove you cannot write a fictional biography of one of history's most captivating figures in a mere 241 pages. I had high hopes because a full third of those pages dealt with Hannibal's boyhood where the author is at full license to use his imagination given the lack of historical detail for Hannibal. But it almost as though Mr Leckie gets bored and rushes through the end in order to begin writing Scipio. Historical inaccuracies aside, the life of Hannibal deserves a better account than the author has attempted and I think it is safe to say that the definitive fictional biography of Hannibal has yet to be written. If you like historical fiction set in the Roman period buy it, if not, don't."
2,A very disappointing experience...,"I couldn't wait to get my pressure cooker. But not only did it take the maximum time to get here, there was also no free educational video inside the box. I returned the pressure cooker immediately because it had no controls on the handle as shown on the online photos -- the very reason I ordered it in the first place."
1,Ready for RICA: A Test Preparation Guide for California's Re,This book is not worth the paper it was written on. I read it from beginning to end and thought I was well prepared for the Rica after scoring very well on the pre-test. Needless to say I was badly mistaken. The pre-test was nothing like the actual test in anything except its structure. I would avoid this book and purchase something that has questions modeled after the actual RICA.
1,RICA book was mis-represented,"I wanted a RICA test prep book and spent a few extra dollars on a book that was in a ""near perfect"" condition. However, when I got this book it had excessive highlighting, worn, and had a coffee stain. I was extremely dissapointed and wish I would have spent less if I was getting a poor condition book."
4,Enjoyable But Calibast?,"I'm a lady gamer and enjoyed Kingmaker a lot. I downloaded the digital download version from Bioware's website, which DOES require a live connection to save and load. Overall, the mod was fun, but I found the romance with Calibast (who is a dwarf with flame on his head), something called an Azer, a little over the top. I prefer my romanceable henchmen to be more than just comic relief. Still the game was fun and engaging, and I would recommend it if you are waiting for NWN 2 to come out and are experiencing a lull.4 stars. Read the mod requirements carefully to make sure you have the required software and hardware before installing."
3,tarnishes,The charm tarnishes extrememly quickly. It is a beautiful design but turned a yucky bronzey color within in a month.
5,Nice pendant,"The mother's body is 'frosted', which I wasn't expecting when I ordered it. But I gave it to my mom for Christmas and she loves it."
5,Special,My 6 year old son picked this out for me and he checks every morning to make sure that I am wearing it! I am very happy with the quality of the pendant and the chain is very nice as well.
2,MCP Review,"It did have it's little glitches, but when it worked it work very well, I had to move up to Music Center Live when I changed my operating system to Windows 2000Pro, and it had problems with the effects not working when I would finish a mix.My biggest complaint would be the lack of support from Data Becker, I wrote them twice asking simple little questions , and never got an answer, I think I'll try Cakewalk next."
5,Loved it!,"I was very happy with my purchase. It was well packaged and arrived before the expected delivery date.It was even more beautiful in person; my 2 1/2 year old daughter looked amazing in it. The best part, it is easy to clean."
4,Good Quick Book full of examples,"Pros:1. The book really gets you to the code quickly which is what I like.2. The book features code in both VB.NET and C#(Francis B Gallagher from catonsville review incorrectly mentions that it does not contain code from both the lang. The author mentions on pg 42 that due to space constraints he will list only one lang or the other. The ""other"" code is available on the website.)Cons:I did not give it 5 stars because it assumes that you have already worked on ASP before and keeps making annoying comparisons throughout the text."
1,Sloppy editing,"I bought this book recently to learn ASP.NET and feel I have mainly wasted my money. In the main the author simply has not put himself into the place of the newbie he aims the book at.Rather than give opinions, let me quote specific examples from an early chapter. Listing 4.1 gives code to be added to the page_load method. When you try to run it it doesn't work. You find out 3 pages later that you should have added a group of ""using"" statements. It would have been easy to add these lines to the snippet, or at least give a forward reference to them.In the same snippet you're invited to open a database named ""pubs"" (Publications) The following snippets perform various functions on this database. But this is not a standard database, and you're given no details of how it's put together so you can mock up your own in Access or whatever.I advise against this book."
1,"Don't buy this item, get a Linksys wrt54g v2 repeater with DD-WRT","Amazon is a great service, i've had no problem with Amazon but i setup this item the day i got it then the next day i tryed setting it up on a different network and it never worked again. After calling Tech support on the phone 2 hours thay said it was defective. I sent it back to PC Universe and they refunded the actual cost but i ate the shipping from PC Universe to me and the shipping back to PC Universe by FedEx (not fair) so i could have almost bought a Linksys WRT54g repeater that works with the shipping expence. The Linksys repeater works without connecting a lan cable, just sit it anywhere & power it up.Hawking can kiss my grits, neva neva again will i buy their products.I reccomend the Linksys WRT54g V2 (wifi repeater)< search on ebay.thanks Amazon you are great"
2,Wireless range is a huge disadvantage,Pros1. Easy installation; works according to guide2. Power adapter is light weightCons1. Extender range is too little. My Dlink router is way more powerful (18dB). I was getting similar signal from my router and the extender at point 3 (1 -2- 3 with 2 being the extender and 1 is my router)2. No option to adjust antenna power (dB)3. Unstable connection when wireless security is deployed4. Cost is NOT justified. A simple directional antenna is more effective alternative and costs a fraction
1,Configuration Nightmare,Spent 3 plus hours trying to configure this range extender - to no avail. The included software did not recognize this hardware and manual configuration failed as well. Unable to reach tech support on the phone. Should have checked the reviews on this product elsewhere (e.g. CNET) - as it is it's on its way back to Amazon tomorrow.
1,Not worth the trouble,"I work in IT and I find this piece of equipment to be ridiculously complicated. I think eventually it is possible to make it work correctly but there are many many things you can do wrong in trying to set it up. My first one worked well for a few weeks, but then started giving only an intermittent signal. Tech support talked me through about 6 troubleshooting steps over 3 calls and finally had me send it back. It took 2 weeks to get an RMA# and then only after I called them to say what's up. I sent it back and again two weeks before I called again and they sent one overnight. I guess they don't do anything unless you complain. This new one seems to work fine except I can't get it to successfully extend an encrypted network of any level encryption. An unsecured network extends very well, but who wants to leave their network open? So it's back to tech support to see if they can explain what I'm doing wrong."
2,"If you invented this product, buy it. Otherwise beware.","I am a Mac user and found this product impossible to configure according to the instructions. Before I bought this product, I read a number of conflicting reviews about the ease or difficulty of configuring the product. I erred on the side of thinking I could do it, and I erred in thinking that. The instructions for Mac users are vague and incomplete and I could not configure the product to work remotely."
5,As Advertised,This product was easy to install and is working fine. Instead of 1- bar we now have 3 bars on our deck behind our home (which is why this product was purchased).
4,Worked Well,"I previously had a Belkin repeater that stopped working after a year or so and I finally got around to buying the Hawking after giving up on the tech support at Belkin. I had it up and running in about an hour or so and it seems to be working very well. I am not a wireless expert and their IP directions were a tiny bit odd (they thought the default wireless would be 192.168.0.1 when my experience is always 192.168.1.1 but once I changed it and followed their directions for all the other items it worked great. Also the sign in on to the Hawking was a bit different with devices than the manual said w/regards to passwords for devices but was able to figure that out too. Will come back here if when I have to reboot my wireless network it gets lost or anything but optimistic for now. Definitely increased range to part of my house w/poor signal, too."
3,so so,the games are so so -- I am not happy that the disk has to stay in the computer - I was under the impression that you could just load it and be done with it.My husband plays it more than I do - there are only a couple of games on the disk that are worth playing.
1,Won't stick to the tile,"I bought this because I thought it would be great for storing toys. I never even put any toys in it and I am returning it immediately. It won't even stick to my tiles. If there is a grout line where the suction cups are supposed to stick, it won't. If you buy it... keep your receipt because you may end up returning it too!"
3,Sticking situation!,"We bought this to replace another brand that stuck on the wall. I made sure to scrub the bathroom walls really good before trying to placing this in our tub. When I tried to attach the suction cups to the wall..they wouldn't line up with the tiles. One side of the Cubby was sitting right on the grout line keeping it from making full contact with the wall. I found out if I angled the cubby just a bit, it would make full contact with the tiles. Unfortunately, the suction cups won't stay on the wall at all. We ended up just leaving the cubby in the tub until the toys are dry and then storing it in the corner of the bathroom because it kept coming unsuctioned and falling off."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"This book was GREAT! It is sooo unlike stevie to be exited about a school report.And what she finds about Veronica is amazing!This book is a MUST for stevie-lovers(even though i am more like Lisa,for i get very good grades and am a begining rider in western)!"
2,Where's the yogurt?,"I purchased this product with the idea that I could insert a quart of luke warm milk in its cardboard container straight into the unit along with starter of course. Since I eat a lot of yogurt and prefer organic yogurt, this seemed like a wonderful idea.However, the milk never became yogurt. The bottom curdled some, while the top retained a consistency of thick buttermilk. This was after 48 hours. Thinking it was something wrong with the milk, I tried a different brand. I also tried a different brand of starter. No luck. Frustrated because I could never get the top of the milk to set, I tried milk in small plastic containers which I stacked inside the unit. Again, the bottom container became yogurt - sort of. The top container remained buttermilk. The real issue with this product is that the heat seems to come mainly from the bottom.I can make yogurt easier using my oven."
4,Good choice,"I'm glad I chose the one quart maker rather than fussing with individual serving containers. The Salton is simple to use and works well.I came up with a good idea for eliminating some of the whey to thicken the yogurt. When you are ready to refrigerate, remove the lid and place a piece of cheesecloth over the container. Secure it with a tight rubber band around the upper edge. Leave it inverted over a bowl in the fridge. By the time the yogurt has cooled you will have drained a lot of liquid. Wash and dry the cheese cloth and use again."
5,perfect yogurt maker,"It's easy to use, and really works well. It's probably the best yogurt maker in the price range. I also like the idea that the inner container can be taken out and put in fridge or freezer."
4,Good Product,I have been using this very effectively and my son likes the yogurt made with this. If they had a timer for shut off it would have been even better.
4,I love it,"Homemade yogurt is the best and it is so easy with the Salton. I like the fact that it makes 1 qt. at a time instead of individual 6 oz. servings. Like other reviews, the lid id not that secure and the serving spoon is worthless, but who cares it works and it's better than using a light bulb in an ice chest like I've heard others do. An empty 1 qt yogurt container fits in the unit, so multiple batches are possible and it gives you a secure lid too."
1,"Great tool for $20 or less, but at the current price?","I have two of these, and they are great. I bought my first one for about $10-15 about 12 years ago, and then they went on clearance for $5, so I snatched that one up. It's easily well worth the purchase price of up to $30 if you're going to make yogurt more than a few times a year. But at $99-250? That's insane. It's not worth that. If/when mine go caput, I'll be using my Excalibur dehydrator, or my induction hob with a water bath, or a thermos."
2,Product Problem or Amazon.com Issue?,"This is the second Salton YM9 Yogurt Maker I've purchased. I bought my first one nearly 20 years ago and absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, the heating element is failing, so I purchased a new one via Amazon.com. The new one doesn't function any better than the old one did, and takes from 10 - 12 hours to cook a batch of yogurt (compared to the 6 hours it should take). I suspect that the one I just bought is defective, but the shipping cost to return it will negate any credit I would receive. I'll be thinking twice before I buy another item through Amazon."
2,"Too small, useless","So small, it holds just a quart of milk(4 cups). The milk has to be boiled (it doesn't do it). It just keeps the milk warm. You can make yogurt yourself without it. You can use container with lid to keep the milk warm. You don't need to pay money to keep the milk warm."
3,Disappointed with this yogurt maker,"I purchased the Salton YM9 based on the many good customer reviews. I've made my own yogurt for years, most recently using another Salton product - a 5-jar unit found at a thrift store several years ago - which worked very well. The YM9 was purchased not quite a year ago to replace the 5-jar unit, thinking it would be simpler to use one rather than 5 containers. I found that the YM9 gets so hot that it curdles the yogurt, rather than producing a smooth, consistently set yogurt. Trying it with a Mason jar instead of the plastic insert didn't make a difference; neither did using several different combinations of milk/yogurt starters, and trying to fine tune the incubation time. Possibly I just got a lemon; I finally put the YM9 away and am again using the 5-jar unit, and getting perfect results again."
1,Why is the price so ridiculous?,I like shopping at Amazon for convenience. But this price is really dumb. I see it on other websites for $16-$25.I noticed a complaint that BlackSheepDeals has had other pricing issues.
5,Awesome product!,"I not only own this machine, I now have 4! My son was diagnosed with Crohns disease so he eats a lot of yogurt for the good bacteria it provides. He eats sooo much I had to buy 4 machines and make 4 quarts every other day to keep up with him! Use a mason jar rather than the plastic insert, it works much better. We also make cream cheese from the yogurt. This machine is invaluable. We let ours cook for 24 hours which removes any remaining lactose for those that can't tolerate store bought yogurt."
3,Overheats! Oven light is cheaper and better,"With so many people liking it its difficult to beat it. For people who can see the reason, try setting the yogurt in oven (heat off) with light on. Oven light generates enough warmth that far superior that this tiny expensive gizmo that overheats. I have one lying with me but I have switched back to oven light. So unless you live in Antarctica or does not have oven (even non-functional since you don't require it to heat) with light bulb, save your money. And since most people already have ovens with light, its clear I am not representing ""special interests"". Also the oven method consumes less power (only tiny light bulb), important to those who care for conservation."
4,Great Yogurt,"Yogurt-making requires considerable preparation before you incubate it. This product is an incubator, no more, no less. However, it's tops at incubating the yogurt! I made mine with goat's milk, and never tasted better.Although it has a dial on top that tells you how many hours you plan to incubate, it would be nice if that was instead a simple timer that would go off when the hours are up. But I suppose that would be a different, more expensive model.All in all, I'm pleased."
3,"Does the job, but short on the details","I have successfully made numerous pots of yogurt with this yogurt maker. The basic machine works well and reliably, however the details are a little lacking. The lid to the pot doesn't fit well, which can be a nuisance if you intend to use the yogurt straight out of the pot. The spoon is entirely irrelevant. The cable does not clip into the underside of the machine. And I was disappointed to find that the timer does not turn the machine off, it simply reminds you what time you started / intend to finish the yogurt. Having said all that, it does do the job."
5,perfect little machine,"I highly recommend this yogurt machine to any one who wants to keep & have home-made yogurt in their refrigerator any time.I followed a technique of a reviewer who had this machine.Without heating the milk, I put refrigerator-cold milk and 1/3 cup yogurt starter (brown cow brand) into the 1 quart plastic container, stirred it until there were no lumps in it and turned the machine on at 8 PM and got my yogurt ready at 8 AM. in 12 hours I had a great tasting, creamy and home made yogurt."
5,I recommend this to moms,This yogurt maker 100% worth the money I paid. Now I use it every other day. It's so easy to use and the yogurt tastes great. My tow two boys love it and most of all it's soooooooo healthy.A mom
1,garbage,"It was not like I was thinking, I tried to make yougart, the way the book told me to do. But after 12 hours of trying, it came out the first time time put it in the maker."
4,Love this yogurt maker,"I've had two of these one quart yogurt makers for about 5 years. One for the house and one for the RV. I make yogurt about twice a week and it always comes out great. I use a 4 cup glass measuring cup to heat in the microwave, and let it cool on a rack for one hour before incubating.I don't like heating in plastic containers, so I use a glass jar I purchased pickles in. It's 56 ounces, so I cann make 5 cups each time. The metal lid didn't fit, so I just use a piece of foil to cover the top.I often make Greek yogurt and yogurt cheese by straining the yogurt.The price of $176 is ridiculus! I paid about $13.95 each, and it included free shipping from Amazon."
4,Solid. Entertaining. Different.,"First things first - I am reviewing this as a book on tape.I am a big reader of mysteries and police dramas and I appreciate it when someone comes up with a unique twist and this one pulls that off in spades.This is the 8th in a series of David Handler books about a novelist/crimesolver named Stewart Hoag. You do not need to have read the other books to follow along.The book gets a 'B' overall - an 'A' for the plot, a 'C' for the fairly lame police characters.The book on tape is read by Gene Corbin who does an admirable job. The cover says it lasts approximately 3 hours, but in reality it's more like 2 hours and 40 minutes."
3,Liked the nipple butter...,"I used a lot of the nipple butter during my first month, but did not need the tea...I had plenty of milk! I thought the booby tubes would be great, but was disappointed. They did not stay warm long enough and I ended up taking hot showers and using a heating pad when I had problems and discomfort. Save your money and just buy the nipple butter."
1,BROKEN five out of six,"This is ridiculous. I ordered these glasses as a Christmas gift. The packaging is a complete joke. The bottom of the inner box is smack up against the bottom of the outer box, and the ""lick and a promise"" paper wrapping of the glasses also does not protect against drops, nothing really underneath each glass. I can't even ask for a replacement, it is so obvious that they will arrive broken with each shipment. Amazon and Spiegelau should both be ashamed of this situation.PS Amazon customer service is great and they managed to get me an unbroken replacement set in time to be given as a gift. Great work guys! But I'm not revising the rating, this is a bad gamble and people need to realize that. The packaging is totally inadequate."
4,"rare and brutal, haven't seen it","I have read about this film in ""Sleazoid Express"" by Bill Landis, who saw it when it played on 42nd Street. He was impressed, and he's seen hundreds of lurid and violent movies. I'd like to see it, but not sure how to play it - I have a regular DVD player. Maybe it'll be reissued someday in the USA format. Landis says the end, where the two girls are raped and murdered by the gang, is so sickening that any audience would be, and was, even on 42nd street in 1980, stunned."
3,An English Mystery with Plenty of Humor and Surprises,"This is a very skilful yarn that starts with a murder in the English countryside, at a progressive school for ""difficult"" boys and girls. It turns out that the school building was once the country home of a corrupt Member of Parliament, Johnny Bogue. Bogue was lost in a plane crash during World War II, but he apparently left something of great value hidden in his former home. Charles Applegate, a new teacher at the school, and Hedda Pont, a very refreshing heroine, get tangled up in the quest for Bogue's ""fortune"", opposed by a group of sinister characters who reminded me of the gang of heavies in ""The Maltese Falcon"". I was most interested by the well-drawn characters (many of them eccentric - the book is quite humorous), and especially by the gradual revelation of the personality and history of Johnny Bogue. (By the way, you won't find out the exact nature of Bogue's fortune until the very end.) Recommended."
1,Save your money !!!,"Range is HORRIBLE, and that's being nice.I have a 3 story house and I lose reception one level away. Waste of money, very poorly constructed."
3,speigelau chard glasses,The opening of the glass is too small to get your face (and nose into it) poor detail in transmission of bouquet and finish of wines. Diva chard glasses are much better for the same money.
1,Be clear that these are not teaching CDs . . .,"From the professional reviews and descriptions of these CDs, it is not made clear that all four CDs in this set are designed to take you into a guided relaxation/trance state. The aim is to achieve their objectives through a trance state. If you are looking for teaching CDs, you need to look elsewhere. If you are looking for something to guide you through their topics using trance or deep relaxation, these may be very good."
3,A bit disappointing to this long-time fan...,"I have wanted to add another Stewart CD to my shelves ever since John died four months ago. However, I am not enthralled with ""Lonesome Picker."" I do like ""The Road Shines Bright"" and ""Daydream Believer"" but the other tunes just don't grab me. I think his ""California Bloodlines"" and ""Willard"" and ""Gold"" releases are all superior to this one. As a fan since the moment he joined the Kingston Trio back in 1961, I am pained to note that John did have, as a solo artist, some indulgent tracks that just come off as pretentious. His ""pretty good"" songs far outnumber his failures, however, and the occasional brilliant lyric makes up for a lot of mediocre moments in his catalogue."
3,A good gadget,Easy to carry on a trip and easy to assemble when needed. I have a bad back and never know when it is liable to fail - it has saved me on a number of occasions.
1,Great idea but poor quality,"We have this bedrail for our daughter. I liked the idea of having a 3-sided bedrail, as she often crams her head to the top of her bed. However, the metal part on the side of our bedrail also snapped and she fell out of bed. I saw another review in which this also happened. Perhaps there is a design flaw or this product is of poor quality. She's not a big girl, only 34 pounds (about average for a 3 year-old)."
2,There are newer works on the market,"Jennings used to be the only quick reference Syriac lexicon but in all candor it's nearly 100 years old, (circa 1926). It is a fuzzy reprint of a lithograph, and the text is nearly illegible. Coupled with the small Serto font and dithered-out vowel pointing, some of which cannot be read at all, one has to labor visually to find and associate terms. I shelved Jennings in favor of the Williams ""Lexicon to the Syriac New Testament"" by DFI Publishing this year. Williams is a new work, accurate and concise, and has exquisite print and vowel pointing printed in a beautiful Syriac font."
2,Poor quality control,"All 6 of of the glasses in my set were at least slightly misshapen, one was positively a mutant! The stems were not centered, and there were, for lack of a better description, glass tumors where the bowls meet the stems. The glasses were also thicker than I expected from Spiegalau. Other Spiegalau items I've purchased have been superb, so this could very well be an anomaly. ..."
3,Not an anomaly,"I'm just letting you know that if you order these glasses you can expect the ""buldge"". All other stemware I've purchased by Spiegelau has been beautiful but all 6 in my set also had slight imperfections, buldges, and an odd thickness where the stem meets the bowl. Maybe one could see this as ""character"". If you want these glasses to match a set, shop around...."
2,Well Intentioned But Scattered,The heart is in the right place as the filmmakers want to show how hard it is to have a healthy diet while loving on food stamps but the film's message is scattered jumping from the ills of mass produced foods to their inability to add cheese to their favorite meals. Would rather watch Food Inc. or read an article on the issue rather than watch this.
5,I am extremely happy with this purchase I have made from A2ZCDS.,"This is a groundbreaking CD - who would ever have thought of making such rarities available to everyday people? I have a friend who prides himself in his collection of old recordings - well, I guess my set of Edison Sound Recordings CDs will shut him up for good. I particularly enjoyed the Popular Instrumental Music, being a fan of military marching stuff. I'm extremely happy with this purchase I have made from A2ZCDS."
1,WARNING- NOT A CD,"I need to warn you all, those who didn't notice or don't know the difference. According to the product page, this is a CD-R, not a CD. CDs are pressed, just like vinyl albums. CD-Rs are burned with lasers. CD-Rs don't last as long, and don't play in all CD players. The risk isn't huge, but it's there and you need to know about it."
2,Needed this for class,"I got a used one for something like $17 or $18, and it was NOT in good condition. It was covered in highlighting, a name on the cover (in pen), random comments throughout (in pen) including some random notes about the former owner's boyfriend. I kept it because I didn't want to mess around returning it and trying to get another one after class started, but I was not happy at all with the quality of this book.TLDR: Beware of ""Used-Good"" condition books. They are often in terrible condition."
2,not recommeded,"this product looks good, but u don't gt wat u seen....... from experience this product is every expensive, actual price should be $10.00 or removed from amazon for customer protection... the grip looks like som1 jst glued the product/ very thin..... think i got a faulty pakage"
4,dropping in with some guy,"There are many great things about this book. It's humorous, gripping, and you just do not want to put it down. I rely enjoyed this book. I give it our stars. It is a must read . Even if you do not like sports you will like this book."
5,Fine Glasses,"These glasses are excellent for serving port. They are delicate, however and require extreme caution when handwashing them. My set of 6 is now a set of 5. However, they are extremely nice and well priced and I highly recommend this product!"
1,my thoughts,"I found this story had very little substance.I like to be entertained and also informed,culture, location, personal interaction.Not interested in sexual details.I just got bored waiting for the story.Alannah"
1,Defective product - ridiculously quick disintigration,"I suspect these bands were exposed to UV or heat while in storage. Most broke immediately, the rest broke within 3 days of use. Plastic elastic braiding bands are meant to be hardy and long-lasting for binding the ends of braids. Instead, these broke more than four times more quickly than the ordinarily weaker black rubber bands I use as short-term ""break-away"" bands for the hair root. (And the black rubber bands I've been using are more than 10 years old). Extremely disappointing performance and not worth even the Amazon ""add-on"" price."
4,Nice glasses,"Got these dirt cheap when Amazon first started carrying them.Think I got these and a half dozen of the Spieglau Chard glasses for $25 TOTAL (less than $3 a stem!).Original intent was to use them for everyday stuff and save the Riedel for special occasions.That attitude does them a disservice. They are almost as nice as the Riedels, and even at $50 for 6 are half the price. Still a very good deal, even if not the steal I got."
2,Not good red wine glasses - too small,"I thought these glasses from Spiegalau would be like the Vino Grande glasses of that brand I have purchased previously from other sellers. Those original glasses compared very favorably with the Riedel Vinum line, but were more sturdy and fairly priced at about $6 per stem. These Vino Grande stems are more like white wine glasses - the bowl is too small for fine red wine. They also feel thick and less delicate the old glasses. I'm returning mine and looking for alternative stemware.Update - in looking around on Amazon, the glasses I remember now appear to be carrying the suffix ""Magnum"" and are no longer available on Amazon."
4,Good Flags,"I ordered a few strings of these flags to decorate my room! while some of the flags are printed lightly, the flags themselves are pretty good. Everyone keeps saying that they leave strings everywhere, but traditionally, they are supposed to... as your flags fray, the wind is supposed to carry away your prayers on the strings that leave it."
2,disappointing,"these are much smaller than the photos show.the size of each flag is maybe 6x6.be sure to open the package as soon as you get it. we waited & when i went to return, unfortunately it was too late.c'est la vie."
2,not happy,These were definitely a disappointment. Each flag was so small and they have been unraveling since they arrived. They were very inexpensive so I guess I should not have expected better quality.
5,Definitive Reference,This book is a must have for Mid-level SunOS and Solaris administrators. Most of the commands work the same on opensolaris and SunOS x86.
1,The Worst Book on System Administration Ever,"Only reason I didn't give this book a 1 is because I'm too kind-hearted. The first edition of this book reeks just as bad as this one does. One can get a better read and more information from the man (Manual) pages. All in all, a total waste of money. I'd rather buy a barrel of manure! In a word: ugh!"
4,Gathering of the Nations,"I was fortunate enough to attend the Gathering of the Nations in Albuquerque in 1999 while on vacation. I went to a dance festival and was mesmerized by the powerful culture of the Native American cultures in attendance: their drums, singing, and dancing. As soon as I heard this CD was out, I bought it to forever remember going to one of the dances. Though it is not the same from the CD player as it was live, this CD stills embodies a lot of the festivities that week. If you are not really into Native American culture it might not be something worth picking up; however, if you like powwow music this CD is definitely a good buy. IThe only problem is that some of the meaning of the songs is lost on me, as I am a casual observer of the music and culture. If you like the CD, go to the festival in April."
1,don't waste your money,"Story Reader books are usually really good, but not this one. All the songs in this book are really cheesy and doesn't relate to the the individual stories, i.e. snow white or mermaid. My daughter loves songs, but with this book, she just doesn't want to open it. I wished the ""true love songs"" would have true love songs. False front cover I would say. Songs from the individual disney stories would of been great, but no go for this one....skip this book and enjoy the original songs from the DVDs!!!"
2,disappointed,"book wouldn't work with cartridge. didn't seem worth it to send it back, when i tried to use a different book to trigger the new page 3 yr old wasn't interested."
5,Revealing,"The first work of this highly talented female musician. Heather Nova has recorded this album at home without a band. But even in the studio with a band, it hardly could have sounded any better. The music of Heather Nova is emotionally as well as spiritually deeply touching. Each song is a revelation of the soul. My favorite songs are Bare"", Spirit In You"", Glow Stars"", Ear To The Ground"" and Talking To Strangers""."
4,Good resource,"I am a FNP who uses this text as a resource when I need to go back to the basics of pharm and put the pieces together- this is more than a ""drug guide"" and less than a PDR as far as information provided."
4,Simple Read.,I really thought that this book was quite easy to learn from. The format is not what I was used to but I quickly caught on the lay out. I would recommend this (although it is now grossly outdated) to the entry level practitioner.
5,Great portable nailer,Honestly a great finish nailer to use. It has lots of power and is really easy to handle with no air hose and compressor. If anyone is interested in this finish nailer I would highly recommened it. I have both the bostitch and a dewalt finish nailers and they don't compare to this 18 volt dewalt model. One down side of the nailer can be the weight which is a little over eight pounds but you seem to get use to it. I got mine brand new at Lowes for $339 and it came in a pack with the 18 volt dewalt circular saw.
4,OK for $,"I was hesitant. Used with my old Minolta XG, it works well. I'd read a few negative reviews in camera forums, but for $$ it's worth it. I think negative reviewers were AP/UPI wanna-bes."
3,"Pretty weird, but not bad..","Alot of people trash Rieber for his views but I love what he's doing, although I have to agree the writing is a bit odd and Jae Lee's art isn't helping at all. I can never get used to Jae Lee. When you put Jae Lee with the writer of ""Books of Magic"", you should know what to expect.It's an interesting spin on Cap, I say go for it, but just remember Rieber was going to build something out of this storyline, and he was never able to complete it, thus the volume after this goes in a totally different direction and will likely never touch upon these topics again. As far as I'm concerned it's an uncompleted work."
1,Don't buy this book,"This storyline comes with a political agenda. If you like having someone else's political views rammed down your throat in a puerile fashion, this book is for you. If you like to make your own decisions on politics, look elsewhere. Marvel allows this ""writer"" to undue over 40 years of characterization (next to Superman, Captain America has been displayed as one of the most patriotic figures in the comics genre), to produce this storyline which I'm certain is entirely consistent with the writer's extreme views. Even putting this aside, the writing is poor, the art is no more than adequate, and the story drags. If you are looking for a good Captain America storyline, try some Kurt Busiek/George Perez Avenger Compilations. This book is a waste of money."
4,Get rid of that big tank,"I bought the outdoor version of this product because I live in one of their eligible Zip Codes. And I love it outside without the extra work of the indoor venting. I bought the 6.4 gallons per minute to handle the main house and the guest house. I have been using it for nine months now. Whom without solar needs to keep even a well insulated water tank hot?The build quality is quite good. Great efficiency cut my gas bill significantly. Short payback when you include the tax benefit.The reason I take away one star is the poor documentation which resulted in an install that needed rework. The poor documentation was aggravated by lousy phone technical support. Bosch should know better.You need to plan carefully for the location and for the diameter and for the kinds of pipe. Distance matters as pipe diameter varies by the distance. And if you put it in a place that is not in easy and comfortable reach, spring for the remote. I did not because it seemed lazy, but I was wrong."
1,Not a book that can be recommended,"This book simply does not explain;and not for student. If you really want to buy, tryModern Advanced Accounting By E. John Larsen."
4,wine enthusiast,"I love the size of these wine glasses and the price. My only complaint would be that they are fragile. I would have liked them to have been made of a thicker glass, however, for the price they are excellent."
5,buy 'em,"Over all glasses seem well made, though I did notice some imperfections and blemishes in the glass. I am raising my rating from 3 to 5 - as I use these more and more I like em more and more."
2,excited then unhappy,"We were so happy that we found something that would hold 3 kids, well the first weekend was great. Second weekend it got a small leak by the zipper. Next weekend filled it up and the hole got bigger about the size of a dime and wouldn't hold air not even for one ride. So shipping when I bought it was $26 and then I had to pay $18 more to send it back. By the time we get it back fall will be here, so I hope come next summer when we can use it, it doesn't get a hole in it right away."
3,Not expensive for a collector's edition title,"Graphically, the game is only a step up from Generals...Fortunately, EA can run an online network to play this game on, unlike Relic's recent failure with Company Of Heroes. Don't get me wrong, CoH is a GREAT game, but playing it online is an outright joke. Even if C&C3; isn't as good as CoH, it will at least be....PLAYABLE!The C&C3; demo is pretty fun, but I'd never rate a product based on a demo so this game gets a 3 star from me until the final release."
3,"Tiberium Wars: Quick, but fun","It was rather quick for an Electronic Arts game, but still fun. I recommend playing it in Normal or Difficult mode to get the most out of it. I love the Command and Conquer franchise that EA has set up, and look forward to their next release."
3,Helpful,"I took a personal interest in religion this past year and was looking for a book that would help explain the Unification Church to me. The first book I bought was very long and confusing, but this book was great. While it did seem that the followers of the Unificationist Church were being portrayed in a somewhat negative light, I still feel that the history of Reverend Moon and his ideas were well described. A very easy read; I recommend it if you would like to understand and read about the religion, but do not wish to have a dictionary next to you at all times."
3,"A practical, neutral and simple guide","Easy to understand, logical and informative. I am against every type of cult and sect, so I think that this collection of books should make everybody clear how difficult it is nowadays to believe in ideas or in Corean false messiahs, who have a bomb factory and who proclame onw nation higher than others (Cor > Jap > the rest > communists). Well, I recommend this book to everyone."
1,Disappointing (redux),"As those before me have mentioned, this book does not deliver on its promise of ""offer[ing] step-by-step advice for students on how to prepare and present their portfolios."" Rather it speaks in broad strokes on the importance of a good portfolio without really giving one any guidance of how to get there. Furthermore, the images seem to have little relation to the text they illustrate, rather they just seem like singular examples of flashy work.The authors mention that architects are generally visual, and that text should serve images that speak to the viewer. They manage to do the opposite here, with the bulk being devoted to droning text and the images offering little narrative and no clear insight on how to achieve the desired product. Read Harold Linton instead."
3,libro muy caro...para lo esperado,sus fotografias son blanco y negro y pequeñas....muy poquitas hojas de ....informacion y no muestra muchos ejemplos de portafolios....sin embargo hay cierta informacion iinteresante...y se le puede sacar provecho.....
3,Not as clever as the original...,"My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES the first Stinkyface book, so I got him this one for Christmas. I was a bit disappointed with the story. My son wanted to see the Sinkyface skunk and it's not in this book. At the end the mother says ""Merry Christmas StinkyFace"" and that's it. The book is mostly questions about Santa Claus and snow. There is a dinosaur - or Christmas-saurus it's called - and that's my son's favorite part. All the illustrations are good - very similar to the first book."
1,Not what I ordered,"These were not the correct product. They do not fit the fryer I own and the labels were covered over and hand written. These are useless to me, not satisfied. People should not mislabel items for sale."
1,Tao of Davis Miller,"If your a Martial Arts fan, you'll be kicking yourself in the head after buying this book,but If you want to read an uninteresting story aboutthe author then you will not be upset,even the reviews on the back cover are a con and written about a different book."
1,The Tao of Bruce Lee,"I've just finished reading this book and I honestly didn't like it at all. I got the feeling that the writer wrote the book for the sole purpose of trying to destroy Lee's reputation. Sure, Bruce had a lot of flaws, we all do. However, he didn't need to concentrate on JUST the flaws for nearly half the book. He interviewed many different people who knew Lee, and made a ""Top 10"" worst moments they had with Lee, where they whined about the days Bruce wasn't nice, or when he did or said something direspectful. Nobody's perfect! Leave the guy alone. If you want to read a good book about Lee's life, this is not it. John Little's work on Lee is MUCH more informative and his books are a lot funner to read. He concentrates on the good parts of Lee's life and personality without disecting all the little flaws in Lee's life."
2,Like a Bad Summer Movie,"Omnipotent villians ... who create wildly complex electronic destruction machines that conveniently fail to work properly when needed to further the story line ... an absurd female character whose only job is to have a flat stomach and ""perfect"" breasts (he mentions that a couple of times). Amazing how the lead character can go through a gruesome day filled with massive explosions and multiple corpses and show up at the beach house ready to mate. This book is like one of those movies you oughta wait to watch on HBO."
3,Good first effort,"I don't give out four or five stars easily so do not take 3 stars to mean this is not a worth while read. The writer has talent at ploting, and his characters are not bad, but I feel like I have been down this road before (FBI profiler chasing serial killer). I did not feel this book added much to the genre. There were no great surprises but it did keep my interest. I probably would wait for the paperback, but I will also look for this authors next book; there is a talent worth watching here! I just finished an interesting thriller: ""A Tourist in the Yucatan"" you might want to check out."
3,not deviant enough,"DEVIANT WAYS is an inventive enough thriller-- the killer knows technology and how to use it to maximum effect--, but Credibility takes an extended Caribbean cruise along about halfway through the novel; one begins to wonder how this psychopath is able to overpower whole families with seemingly effortless ease and rig up all these elaborate devices undetected, especially when he blows up a whole neighborhood. The characters aren't as convincing as they could be (compare the FBI agents to those in Connelly's THE POET), especially the killer who, for the most part, remains just a shadowy figure throughout most of the novel. The ending is fairly decent, but if only the rest of the novel had been as twisted and creepy as Chapter 24, he could have really had something.PET PEEVE DEPT.: Add Mooney to the growing list of authors-- Michael Connelly, Christopher Reich, and Robert Walker among them-- who think ""ahold"" is a word."
4,True to heart,"I'm not much of a reviewer, I liked this book. I love reading John Irving's books. The way he writes is soulfull. I enjoyed this book because I love to read storys of how people live their lives. All the twists and turns.... I truely love to read John Irving. I hope a new book will come out soon."
1,"Okay, place me in the minority.","I ran out to buy this book as soon as I read an early review--the NY Times, I think. Besides, one of the main characters has a name similar to mine, I liked Garp, and I've always admired a writer who is a Renaissance Man, able to write knowingly of wrestling, running, lifting weights, etc. However, my 17 bucks was wasted, I'm afraid. The book plodded from chapter to chapter, character to character, towards an ending that was all but announced in the first chapter. Overall, Widow was a tedious, mechanical read that was more demanding on me than my matching John Irving push up for push up."
2,"I Tried to Care, But Just Yawned Instead","I gave this book three chances, the last after taking a two-week break from it. It just never grabbed me. The first 200 pages are witty and interesting, but as the hum-drum bore of a protagonist gets older, she loses her appeal. There are some glimmers of good reading in here, but overall this is not nearly Irving's best."
4,Made me want to read all of Irving's work...,"This was the first John Irving novel I read. Since finishing it I have read Garp, Owen Meany and Cider House. I would have to say that Widow is my favourite. It was the incredibly detailed and complex (Ruth) characters that made it such an intriguing read. I can't believe the people that are carving this book... It makes me laugh when people say how poorly the book was written and they have trouble putting coherent, error-free sentences in their reviews."
5,An Addict for Three Days,In the Summer of 1998 John Irving may just have been one of the most brilliant authors alive...
1,At least I bought it in a sale,"John Irving is a very talented storyteller which is why I bought A Widow for One Year. However, I couldn't even finish (in italics) this book. I became annoyed early on when Irving describes Eddie as carrying ""a heavy duffel bag and a lighter, smaller suitcase"". Unfortunately he does this about ten (in italics) times in as many pages. After the third time I was mentally screaming ""ENOUGH ALREADY. I GET THE PICTURE. 'LUGGAGE' IS OKAY NOW."" Irving's constant use of italics is also extremely (in italics) helpful. I couldn't have possibly worked out the nuances of the conversation for myself. NOT. Combined with the thin and dreary plot, this work is not exactly a page turner. More of a page churner."
2,REPETITIVE WRITING MARS INTERESTING PREMISE,THIS STORY STARTED OUT WONDERFULLY WITH STRONG CHARACTERIZATIONS AND GREAT DETAILS. THEN IRVING WEARS OUT THE READER WITH INCESSENAT ITALICS (AT LEAST 5 ON EVERY PAGE!) AND AFTER THE FIRST TWO THIRDS OF THE NOVEL IT DRAGGED ON AND ON. HIS EDITOR IS OBVIOUSLY AFRAID TO TELL IRVING THAT HIS BOOK WAS 200 PAGES TOO LONG.
3,"Entertaining, but not as good as Son of the Circus","This book kept me entertained, but it lacked the humor and wit of a Son of the Circus. The Ruth character would have worked much better for me had Irving not skipped straight from age 4 to age 36 with only a few references to her formative years, and the constant harping on her breast size was unnecessary. I did enjoy his continued ability to weave a stories within the story, though. I'd call it a decent vacation read."
3,"Unremarkable, but you have to read it from front to back.","This book has been marketed to be par with Irving's World According to Garp book. But the only thing similar would be the human condition of the main character growing from childhood through adult. It lacks a lot of the fine writing in Garp. There were many times I felt like I was just trudging through the book, but you do have to finish the book to the _very last sentence_ before you get a complete sense of the book. It's not one of those books where you encounter a great experience reading the book, but you do have to reach the last page before you reach a point of satisfaction. A lot of the book makes dull reading, but it may be worth a look just to experience this start-to-finish effect which is in itself well-done."
2,Still a hopeful (less certain) fan.,"I found this novel to be very disappointing. After struggling with ""A Son of the Circus"" (and, finally, giving up after 100 pages), I was eager to read ""Widow."" While I did finish the book, it was not a page turner. I've read the other reviews at this website and, while fellow disappointed fans pretty much covered the flaws in ""Widow,"" I noticed that no one mentioned one blatant message that I could not escape (though I tried to deny it):Mr. Irving does not like women.I had heard about a review that called Mr. Irving a misogonist, and I regretfully agree with that description. I will think carefully before tackling a new Irving novel in the future. For now, I too will re-read ""Owen Meany"" -- by far Mr. Irving's greatest novel."
4,Noooo!,"While at times the story dragged, interest was maintained by my faith that there would be resolution. While Mr. Irving provided closure at several junctures, he leaves us with the mother of all cliff hangers, resulting in a slew of expletives. Still, a very good read."
2,I knew it wouldn't be Owen Meany and was STILL disappointed,"John Irving seemed to be presenting his story of Ruth Cole as if from a great distance. His narrative seemed often to be building up to something - as if it were all deep background -- that never happened. Astounding coincidences aside, the narrative was so sparse, so clinical (and pretty crude)that it was really difficult to relate to any of the characters. For example, it was hard to imagine why Ruth Cole and Hannah were ""best friends"" as they acted like they only hurt and annoyed each other. They didn't seem to understand or to comfort each other. It was as if Irving said they were best friends, so they were, but there was no reason to believe. I did like the narrative devices that Irving used, including Ruth's postcards and journals as a chapter, and one of her short stories. It enriched what was otherwise a sparse narrative. In all, the first section was the most compelling, the rest... not so much."
1,"Garbage, a waste of time","Thankfully, I borrowed this book from a friend. What trite garbage. After reading about 200 pages, I had to force myself to skim it to get through the rest of it. The first few pages are well done. Unfortunately, Irving goes nowhere from there. The predictability of the plot is something I would expect from a very, very young writer. Boring-----"
2,No! No! No!,"I am a huge Irving fan who reads most of his novels at least once every two years, but I have to be honest: ""Widow"" (along with ""Son of the Circus"") will probably be a once every three or four year read. Like so many, I loved the first section; it is Irving at his best - the characters are rich and their hearts are alive. But once everyone grows up, the tale turns into a disaster. So much of a disaster I wonder if Mr. Irving isn't playing some sort of a game with us. Immediately after closing ""Widow"" - like someone washing down horrible tasting medicine with their favorite beverage - I began to swallow up the glory of Owen Meany again; Franny and Family will follow."
5,A tribute to the strength of love in any family,The believable characters and the depths of grief and love are portrayed in this book better than most I have read before this. John Irving has a unique slant on the human condition and a depth of understanding for the intricate dynamics in any family--disfunctional or not. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and missed its characters when I finished it.
2,And the point is...?,"This book was one that I didn't want to put down because of the strange and sordid things that happened to the characters, but once I reached the end, I wondered what the point was. I couldn't identify with the motivations of any of the characters; they didn't seem to evolve much at all throughout the book.This was the first book I've read by John Irving, so perhaps meandering is a trademark of his. In my opinion, this would be a good book to take on a long flight, but it's not a book that will change anyone's life."
3,Can Unlikable Characters Really Live Happily Ever After?,"I was reluctant to add another opinion to the plethora of reviews on this book, but as a John Irving fan, I feel compelled to analyze why I didn't enjoy this book. As other reviewers have pointed out, some incredibly unbelievable events drive the plot. The explicit depictions of sex didn't bother me, but the whirlwind love affair between Ruth and Harry just didn't ring true. Several parts of this book really pulled me in, such as Rooie's story and the fling between Marion and Eddie. But there were many long stretches when I just didn't care about what happened to the characters. The last 5 pages are deeply satisfying, but they aren't enough to fully compensate for the sometimes tedious chapters that preceded them. If you're looking for a really good Irving book, pick up The Cider House Rules instead."
3,Loved the beginning - lost me at the end...,"I am a true fan of John Irving. I was, however, disappointed with ""A Widow for One Year"". I found the beginning of the story (first third of the book) to be entertaining - but I thought the storyline really went down hill for the reaminder of the novel. I didn't care about Ruth and I thought the portrayal of Eddie was ridiculous. Additionally, I thought far too much time was spent in Amsterdam - focusing on ""My Last Bad Boyfriend"" (horrible title!). Finally, I wanted more from the ending. I remain an Irving fan, but would not recommend this book - especially to first time Irving readers."
3,Good Reading with a lull in the middle,"I have always loved John Irving's books and couldn't wait to read ""A Widow."" The book is exceptionally good for most of it's tale. However there is a lull about 3/4 into it...and then it is rushed to a finish. It is a good read...but I felt sort of like an endurance race finishing the book."
2,Dissapointing,I absolutely love John Irving. The Cider House Rules and A Prayer For Owen Meany are my two most favorite books of all time. I was very dissapointed with this book to say the least. I'm not sure how to fully explain my thoughts on the book. It seemed like just when I was starting to like the story or a character something would and I wouldn't like the character or the direction of the story. I tried very hard to like it while I was reading it and it never happened. I agree with what on reader said about it lacking warmth. None of the characters seem to have any passion behind anything that they do. It seems like they move on sick compulsions.
3,"Comfortably Irving-esque, but lacks his usual spirit","I am happy to report that Irving is back from his hiatus seen in Son of the Circus. His Dickens-like style flows evenly throughout Widow, and he develops some good characters in Ruth and Eddie. But, I found this book simply enjoyable when I was hoping to find it moving -- as I did with Owen Meany and Cider House Rules. Widow's cental character is a woman, which is new for Irving, and he does a convincing job with her, but I found him attributing most of his energy to achieve humor with the male characters. I don't think he's comfortable yet in giving women the laugh. If you are not yet an Irving fan, you would do better to start with A Prayer for Owen Meany, or Cider House Rules. If you are an Irving fan, wait for the paperback to discover the enjoyable, yet mild Irving charm in Widow."
3,Where did the cop come from?,"I too am a huge Irving fan, and though I am not disappointed with Widow for One Year, it has left me confused. I did enjoy the glimpses of previous stories and familiar places, but Ruth's character seemed more ""surfacey"" than previous main charcters. I did not care about her, nor was I led to some understanding of her motives. I felt as though Irving stayed in the shallow end of the pool with Ruth.I could not help but feel that this story began in Irving's mind with Eddie. This character's motivation and events were the best part of the book for me. My favorite being when Eddie is contemplating asking Hannah to share the house with him. Eddie's character felt like familiar territory, classic Irving.I believe I will give Widow a second read this summer. As a woman, I probably expected more from Irving's Ruth. I may have missed something, but, figuratively, where did the cop come from anyway?"
1,Not My Type,"I picked up this book based on numerous good reviews on the internet, plus, john irving is a renowned writer. However, I couldn't bring myself to continue reading past page 20. The characters are a bit too weird for me. I believe this is my first & last john irving's book."
3,"Unfortunately, not one of Mr. Irving's best.","I am a big fan of Mr. Irving's work, but this novel failed to live up to the standards set by his previous work. While it was entertaining in a Danielle Steelesque kind of way, Mr. Irving's choice to write this novel from a woman's point of view ruined the book for me. Ruth's character was not only difficult to sympathize with, but her thoughts and actions were so obviously written by a man. I usually look forward to reading any new novel by John Irving; however,I was truly disappointed in this one."
1,Not a Fun Ride!,"Like waiting for a long time for a bus , I plodded through this monotonous, boring story waiting for the 'masterpiece' to appear, it never did. I wanted to give up on it many times but felt I'd already invested too much. I had not read a John Irving book since the Hotel New Hampshire (which I loved) and I had high hopes for this one.I found the characters one dementional and the plot unbelievable. Other than Marion the characters were neither likeable or compelling as well as inconsistant (ex: Ed emerges as a confidente youth after his summer with Marion only to come back 30 + years later as a bumbling hack?). I also found it all highly predictable. I was so sick of hearing about those picture hooks, and photos, UGH!!! Possibly the most intersting story, Tom Coles involvment with a mother and daughter he never even goes into. I really feel I wasted good reading time, I should have just walked!"
3,entertaining - not particularly moving,"John. . . Could somebody shake him violently please? I won't go on about feminism or breast references or male empowerment - it's pointless. As a woman and a fan of Irving's I have been patiently trying to put method to his madness. Owen remains a favorite, I buy used copies by the truckload and pass them out to the un-Meanied. Garp had the same magic. Unfortunately once again ""Widow"" is a failed attempt. We revisit less defined or believable (tired) repeats of Irving Standard characters. The book was more of a night of TV then any literary journey. Try again John."
1,Boos from a fan of many years,"This book is an embarrassment. Irving must know that since the paperback version has an interview with him appended as a feeble attempt to explain to us why he wrote such a bad book. It was also offensive both in storyline, character development and presentation. Mr. Irving, please cease your habit of emphasizing words via the use of italics. It was distracting at first and then just plain annoying. I cannot believe this mess was from the same author of Owen Meany, Garp and Ciderhouse. I am so terribly disappointed and angry at the time I spent trying to find out if anything of any merit was being said."
5,The perfect red wine glass!,"I bought 12 of these for myself in January and love them. After several blind tastings we even determined the wine actually tastes better in this glass. They feel great in the hand and on the lips.I have been washing in the dishwasher on gentle, top rack. No problem. They are all still in perfect condition.Highly recommended!!!!!!"
5,Astonishing experience,This is one of the best guided visualizations I have ever experienced. Truly remarkable!
1,It's not wool,"This product is not wool. How can you call a sock that is 30% wool, wool? It's like like calling an artificial christmas tree real because it contains a wood truck that makes up 30% of the weight."
4,Love it,"Since I bought this case Ive put on about a thousand bicycle miles while it was housing my Barretta 92. I kept the gun and case above my left hip and even though the gun weighed almost 5 lbs quicky forget that it was even there.It forms to the body nicely. The nylon version is well made and well thought out. The straps sometime loosten up a little and they sometimes need to be readjusted (minor problem). There are three other compatments for storing wallet, phone, pepper spray, ammao etc. If you can afford the price, its a quality piece."
4,My son loved this book,my 4.5 yr old son loved the story. it shedded light on how not all animals have to be scary or bad
2,Very shallow overview of MBTI and matches,"I first came across this book many years ago, without any familiarity of MBTI. I tested INTP in this book, and was so upset by the overwhelmingly negative description of that type (and all NTs for that matter), that I cried, and then I rejected the entire system. The book seemed to stereotype people in horrible ways, and I related to no type in it. The descriptions are caricatures, and the advice for meeting types & getting along with them is cliche.Years later, I revisited MBTI, only to discover through much better tests that I am an INFP. Reading other material helped me learn much less biased views on my types and others, what my strengths/flaws/needs as an INFP are in relationships, and who might make a good match for me. In contrast, this book pigeon-holes people and gives you a mental block on certain types. I give it 2 stars for introducing me to MBTI, albeit poorly, because I find the typing system fascinating in general."
1,Broke after 1 week,This toy was fantastic fun - for one week. My 5 year old son loved it and was surprisingly good at controlling the boat. He did not crash it once and it zoomed around in our pond giving several hours of fun during the week we had it in the summer. However it stopped working on the 7th day (was it observing the Sabbath?) and despite replacing the battery pack it just would not work again. I tried contacting the company and asking for a replacement or a refund but they ignored me. I would not buy this boat again or deal with this company. A big fat waste of $40.
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this boat for my 13 year old son he was so excited to start using it but he tried out of the water to make sure it worked but it didnt. To get it to work you have to put it in the water so he did that and it worked great. But the next weekend we went camping and they have a pond. Thats when it started showing problems. It doesnt have very much range as far as the remote. And it went really slow. So we got back home and he used it in our pool but then the left motor kept pulsing and he tried to turn it off but in kept doing it. He had tried doing everything he could but turned out to be a piece of crap.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS PRODUCT IS JUST ANOTHER HEADACHE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Didn't run for long...,"I purchased this boat as a Christmas gift for my boys. It was a blast playing with this boat out on the lake at first. But, after half a day the right propeller stopped working. Then the battery wouldn't hold a charge. The worst part was I sent it back to distributer and they never reimbursed me my money back! They informed me that they never received it even though I sent it through UPS. The over all experience was awful."
1,pieces missing - and it boat not work....,"The remote control device was missing the antennae when it arrived. The vendor didn't respond to requests to send one, so we bought a replacement antennae at a local hobby shop.The boat still didn't function. We weren't sure if there was a wiring issue, but everything appeared to be in order. The propellers would spin very briefly with a short burst, sometimes, but in general it was completely unable to operate.It doesn't appear to be very durable, and we weren't sure it would have lasted very long anyway.This is the first item I have ever bothered to return to Amazon.com!"
5,Much needed Info for Guys who need a Change!!!,"The Mack Within really helped me to not just understand women but how to also better my self. Thinks Tariq I really learned alot from you, Keep on Going your the man!"
3,Tariq is not right about everything,This book does gives good advice however I dissagree with Tariq Nasheed on somethings like he says never ask a woman for her number instruct her. Women don't like what to be told to. And I don't see how women can have a problem with the nice guys instead they what these stupid bad boys. Back in the old days they had classier smarter women unlike conservative girls this generation.Women turn down guys on purpose to make themselves feel empowered (like their better then men) PLEASE!
3,What happened to the original music???,"It is one of the best, if not the best gundam series ever. BUT, for whatever bizarre reason, the original opening and ending songs have been deleted. WHY???Otherwise, I would give this series 5 stars."
3,Average!,"""Literacy and Longing in L.A."" by Jennifer Kaufman and Karen Mack centered aroud Dora, a recent divorcee, currently unemployed and she indulged in binge-reading. Basically, Dora locked herself in her apartment or more specifically, her bathroom, for days, ignoring calls and sitting in her tub, just reading. Her social life was basically visits from her sister or mother and her trip to the local bookstore. At the same time, Dora found herself becoming attracted to the local bookstore's assistant, Fred, while still harboring some feelings for her ex-husband.The book was written pretty well, as the main character, Dora was well developed. There were also many references to books which may delight some readers, and bore others. However, this was a rather slow read for me. Half way through the book, I found myself struggling to finish it as I was not very engaged."
3,Self-preoccupation in L.A.,"I thought I would enjoy this book because I had such sympathy for the book junkie heroine, especially her escape into ""book binges"" when life threw her curveballs. But sadly, I am afraid it is ultimately just your average chick-lit, with a few well-known quotes thrown in. The story is far-fetched, the narrative stitched together - Yes, the middle of the book when she forms an interesting relationship with a woman and her granddaughter is the best and most vivid part - but the contrivances that bring them together are unbearable. Finally, there is no arc to the book at all, just the meandering of a woman with what I call ""rich people's problems"". If you would like a truly enjoyable literary book of another kind - skip this and check out ""Special Topics in Calamity Physics"", by Marisha Pessl."
2,Disappointing,Just another Cinderella story. The authors drop literary names and quotes the way the other books in the chick-lit/ contemporary romance genre drop high-end designer names. The book has nothing whatsoever to say about literary works it references; they are just another layer of treacly frosting on a cardboardy mass-produced cake.
4,great tool for the money,"The nailer arrived in like new condition. I've used it for one roof so far with little complaint. The nailer is light enough to stay on the roof without sliding off, but has plenty of power. I used bostitch nails and had only a few misfires, mostly due to bent wires on the coils. If you are careful loading it, the gun does not jam or misfire. The gun has good depth adjustment, is accurate and very light and compact."
1,Avoid this tool and company,"I purchased this reconditioned tool on 12/15/10, I used it for 2 days beginning 1/24/11, and it failed on 1/27/11. It bypasses air, when trigger is pulled, no nail. I called CPO, they no longer honor the 30 day warranty. I called Bostitch Service and they said take it to CO (287 miles away) or send it at my own expense to Louisville, KY. They also said I could take it to a Authorized Dealer in ABQ, NM so they could ship it to KY. I called the number they gave me and it has been disconnected. I looked up the name on the internet, got a different number and have been calling for 2 days, but they do not answer the phone (no message option available). I will never buy from Stanley Bostitch again, and do not recommend this tool."
3,"Not quite ""reconditioned"" enough","Great timesaver on shingle installation....when it worked as designed.A lot of time wasted clearing out jams. Piston/driver was worn.Could have been due to off-brand nails, but I doubt it."
1,Don't do it.,"Bought this nailer to do my roof. Unfortunately I waited till the cooler weather to do it so I can't return it, Nailer fired about 50 nails then quit. Now I'm screwed.Update-----After a week being repaired I got my nailer back. No charge for the repair. Maybe if it stops raining I can do my roof. Add a star for repair service.Nice day, no rain, took my nailer and some shingles up on the second story, nailer fired 21 nails then quit. Same problem as first time. Back to repair service. A hammer is looking like a much more reliable way to do my roof."
1,"Overhyped, heavily mixed, homogenized sound.","The sound is heavy and thick. Baaba's voice is totally drowned in tens of mixed tracks. No wonder, it took two years to produce the cd. The disc is heavily processed and homogenized to sound like every over ""world pop"" disc. Total disaster. To hear the real Baaba try ""Djaam Leeli"", his album with Mansour Seck."
1,These rice cakes are heavy and don't taste good!,"Quaker rice cakes far surpass these rice cakes in taste.The ones I ordered on Amazon were not good. They were heavy, crumbly and tasted weird."
2,Dislike Vocal,"I gave my cd away. Too bad it couldn't keep me interested after a few plays. Everytime I heard Robin Fox's voice, it made me sick to my stomach. She really seem to have a problem letting her voice out and she sounded in agony.I think if they leave her out and make the cd more instrumental then many people will come to like it. That's what attracted me at the first place. I can now see why it's taking Robin Fox along time to have a new album release. Everyone knows that you can't last with a computerized voice (I recommend Fragma, DJ Enjore with Engelina, or 4 Strings if you're looking for some trance music with vocals)."
2,"pricey, motor stick's in plunge base.","Hi, I purchased this plunge base to basically assist in fluting for mantle's. The only complaint is screwing the motor into the base is tough. Getting the motor out of the base is almost impossible.I have to spray silicone lubricant on the connection and two BIG STRONG MEN have to use all of their strength many, many, time's to extract the motor."
4,open mind? or closed heart!,"Every track on this C.D. holds something of a surprise for everyone. It's hard to put it simply. This has a wonderful mix of vocal & instrumentation, horns-harmonica-guitar to pedal steel. And almost a comical play on words. The production lines{re}bass and drums has to be some of the best offered anywere today. Dance-sing-cry. Do all these things I suggest you buy it. You will be well rewarded. Myself, I will keep this C.D. close at hand always. After all WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHERThanks for keeping the music playing! G.S.G. 04/19/00"
4,By the hair of my chinny chin chin,This works great to get rid of these little hairs that start popping out on your face and chin making you look like a cat fish if you don't pluck or pull them.
1,Turbo Tax pulls a fast one!,"After using Turbo Tax for over 10 years and receiving a free federal e-file via reabte, TT has eliminated this feature claiming, believe it or not, that is what their customers wanted ...lol. Yes, I wanted to pay 10 to 15 more dollars to use their product. And nowhere on their packaging do they mention it now costs to federal e-file for TY 2005. You buy the software, you open it, discover the added cost and probably can't take it back to the place of purchase. Tax Cut here I come."
3,Perhaps the best out there but still in need of improvement,"I've used Turbo Tax for many years now so I can compare this to previous versions. For the most part, it's the same Turbo Tax you're used to. You're asked questions and you proceed through the workflow of doing your taxes by doing each section (e.g. Income, Deductions, review etc.)What I found awkward was going back and examining parts of my taxes once they were done. Say you get another 1099 in the mail or just want to see a summary of what you've entered. You're forced to step through the interview again to see or update any old data. I'm no Turbo Tax professor so there may be a better way but I still find the interface somewhat awkward if you don't just finish the thing in one complete run. I like to review sections and make sure I've entered everything properly. It should be easier and unfortunately it's less easy with the 2005 edition then it was before."
2,Basic Macintosh Version - Round Off Flaw Found,"This review is for Turbo Tax Basic for Mac/PC 2005The software is easy enough to use but either out of curiosity or self abuse, I checked the results manually and found a round off flaw contained in the program. If you are self employed and use Form SE (Self Employment Tax Form) the program fails to round ""up"" correctly. The mistake favors the individual and not the Feds. This is a math error and the IRS can red flag it.I remember several years ago I purchased the Deluxe or Premire verson and the program recommended that I might consider putting $300 into my IRA in order to lower my tax bracket, it was great! However subsquent versions did not do this, after which I only purchase the Basic version."
1,Won't Run,"I installed TurboTax Basic 2005 on my old PC (Pentium 2 running Windows Me), and when I try to open a return file I get an error message and TurboTax closes. I tried contacting Intuit for assistance, but they aren't being helpful. I've never had such problems with previous years."
4,Good start up tycoon game,"if you are unsure of tycoon games, and want a game that is easy to play and gives you an idea what tycoon games are about then this game is for you. If you are familiar with tycoon games and want a challenge then this game is not for you. The game only has one mode in the beginning which is classic game which is story mode. You must go through the entire classic game to unlock all cities. Once the cities are unlocked it goes back and revisits whatever city you choose using the money you won previously in that game. Once classic is over it is rather boring. Yes. classic has some fun story tale twists that are fun to choose different options on, but that is also limited in the options.In conclusion. this is a great tycoon beginner game, but if your used to other tycoon games that move at a faster pace you will want to pass on this one."
2,Boring for adults,"Perhaps the problem is that I bought this game for myself, and I am over the age of 8 years.The character art started off with promise but rapided declined into something miniaturized, boring and with about as much visual stimulation and interaction as an ant farm. I gave this game about 30 minutes of attention, before I decided that I could not bear looking at the boring, small figures of townspeople running up and down the streets of the village any longer.Then, I deleted the game from my computer and decided to give it to my 8 year year old grandchild. I will let her know that this game does not require much participation. If she gets bored, she can give it to someone younger than herself.Don't buy this game, if you are older than 8."
2,Failed Quickly,"This pump worked great for first couple of times I used it but within a few weeks of receiving it, it failed me twice during the same trip to the river with my inflatable boat. First one of the metal bands holding the bellows fabric slipped off and allowed the air to escape the bag. I managed to get this fixed in the field with a screwdriver I just happen to have on a multi-tool. Later once I was on the river I tried to pump up an inner tube only to find a tear in the side of the bellows right below the metal band that did not fail. I did patch the hole but it has not held. So after less than a month the pump is almost worthless."
2,Gibberish,"As an orthodox Catholic, I share some of Kathleen Keating's concerns and views. This being said, however, her book is a hopeless mess. It's riddled with off-the-wall speculations, paranoid delusions, risible messages from unapproved apparitions, and the crudest theology imaginable. The sooner I can put this absurd reading experience behind me, the better."
1,rip off:-(,This poster was horrible. I could have had my 5 yr old son draw me a better one. It was very disappointing. You should be ashamed of selling such a bad product. I wish I could have given you a zero.
2,Bring back the stories about ordinary cops!,"Joseph Wambaugh's earlier books were renown for their black humour which would sometimes be so good that you would laugh out loud. He told stories of cops walking the beat and living on the edge.As the years passed, he seemed to strongly veer away from this sort of story and go towards stories with cops as a side attraction but novels that were more about human nature.In this novel, we are in the Golden Orange, an area where the very rich people play and we get to see Winnie, a former cop and current alcoholic who is down on his luck, who meets a wealthy woman who has secrets.The book itself is not terrible or anything, it is just ordinary. There is very little humour and it just seems to me like the author was writing about the people that he spends time with. The problem is that the wealthy tend to be rather dull......"
3,money and the evil sides,The Golden Orange was a vivacious book that dealt with human emotion in both positive and negative ways. The toll that money takes on human spirit is very evident in this compilation. The use of symbolism is mysterious and links the book together all the more. The characters are described in such a way that you develope feelings for them. The Golden Orange is a well thought out book and the twist in the plot adds even more corruption to the pages. The book fools you in a way that you find amazing after the last page is read. Greed and luxary is the main focus for some characrters while for others it is excitement and a new start on life. The setting and description of the Golden Orange give you a real sense of the rich and the bad blood attitude. All in all the book is worth the time to sit and relax with.
5,Great Quality,"I actually bought this product to use as a cover for my outdoor fire pit. No other fire pit cover fit mine because the design of my fire pit is tall but slender. I took the risk and ordered this product because the shape seemed to fit my purpose. I absolutely love it, the quality of this cover is great and will definitely last for many years. I highly recommend this product and the other covers by this manufacturer. I also have the grill cover by this brand."
5,radio,I think that the motorola fr60 is the best. The whole family has them. we use them everywhere we go.........
3,What do you expect for $79.95,"This lens has serious purple and green fringe problems under contrasty situations, it is difficult to focus due to the minimum f/8 aperture, the images are soft and all of this gets worse when fitted with the 2X tele extender. However, the Opteka 500 can provide some reasonable results under optimum conditions. The lens barrel and tripod collar are well made and the lens has a nice weight without being heavy. While it is not a professional lens by any stretch it is a pretty good deal for $79.95.I doubt that I will keep this lens for long because I need more quality than this lens can deliver for my work, but then I was not expecting it to."
1,Does not work with Nikon D5000,"Although it is listed as compatible to Nikon D5000, it doesn't work with the camera. You will get missing lens message. In full manual mode, you cannot change aperture ( +/- button + dial ), resulting in blurry pictures in broad daylight, using a tripod.About the product:Lens is nicely constructed and T-Mount provided with it, is totally flimsy.While ordered as new, lens and ring had signs of wear and tear. Minor cosmetic scratches on lens and a bad T-mount.About the seller:To return INCOMPATIBLE product with false claims, YOU NEED TO PAY minimum 15% restocking fees and return postage.If it was EBAY, buyers protection would have saved me from buying a wrongly portrayed product. Not on Amazon."
4,They're not from England!,"Just to clear something up that was mentioned by another review, the Tender Idols are not from England. They are from Atlanta, Georgia.Anyway, that's not really the issue. The Tenders Idols have been around for a while (check out the haggered face of the guitarist - he looks like John Lennon after Yoko had sucked the life out of him) and Distressor is their third album. It's also their best, possibly because they have themselves a fairly new - and extremely talented - bassist in Joe Jones.Distressor is a mix of everything associated with Brit pop with a little punk and heavy rock thrown in for good measure. It's nothing very innovative or particularly new, but it's a very well produced album that is the kind of CD I like to listen to when I write. They're a solid band who deserve to start getting some recognition soon."
3,Abandoned Concepts/Underdeveloped Story-lines,"This trilogy got progressively worse for me. The first book (REEFS OF SPACE) I really liked and it was my favorite, but by the time I reached the final pages of the third book (ROGUE STAR) I didn't really know where the authors were heading with it and I really didn't care.I felt they had abandoned some earlier concepts a little too early, and perhaps could have pursued and developed other story-lines further. I hate when that happens! Abandoning one really cool concept or story-line for a lame one. I couldn't buy into that ""infant star has a crush on a beautiful woman"" thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It ate her boyfriend and that's why it has feelings for her. Still not sold."
4,A little misleading,I was expecting 12 bags at 6 oz each. I got one big plastic bag with all the candy in it.
5,CREME SAVERS are the BEST,I love the Creme Savers Hard Candy. I wish they would bring back the Butter Toffee and Cream flavor. IT IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!Why are so many flavors discontinued?
5,Way beyond other Crowley books,This was the best book I've read on A. Crowley. L. Sutin added an immense amount to what had been written about Crowley - he went way beyond the previous research on Crowley and conveyed it in a style that made it a pleasure to read.
2,Oh Please!,"Sadly, while it will make many Thelemites happy by being nicer to AC, this book is a simpler version of Symond's ""Great Beast"". If you want to read any original thinking or new research on AC's life, you won't find it here. The lack of footnotes, and over all simplistic style makes this a real disapointment."
4,father of evil yeah baby,"headbangers this is the reason why you all bang your head in the name of the devil this is the reason you fornicate and do drugs. you wanna proper introduction to magic, the occult, prophecy, drugs, satan, promiscous sex, and demons you should check it out but be warned you'll never be the same after you explore the dark truths bad things have been known to happwen and changes in your morals are sure to follow."
5,I'm gaining weight from all the waffles!,"I live alone and cook for myself, so this is just a great little appliance that doesn't take up much room and changing the plates doubles the features. Mine came without any instructions (later T-Fal promptly sent me one), but I forged ahead and it really couldn't have been simpler...or better. Although I use a non-stick spray initially, it's never once stuck. Cleanup is made easier if you wipe overflow with a damp towel as it occurs. The pocket sandwich feature is terrific. This has been an affordable, worthwhile addition to my meal prep."
4,Bargain that works!,"It makes pocket (almost Panini) sandwiches and it makes waffles.Not many cookers out there that do both, and this one does them well.Is it as good at toasting sandwiches as a $100 Panini Grill? No, but unless you really do a lot of that, who needs it?The sandwiches work really well, and the waffles are good.It only does two at a time, but again, unless you feeding a lot of people...For under $30 this is a real bargain."
1,My Wife Doesn't Like It,"Unfortunately, my wife did not share with me how much she disliked this unit in time to return it.The sandwich maker inserts are molded for diagonally cut bread. You can't just stick a full sandwich in it -- and it only takes really small slices of bread. Forget about putting your Orowheat premium bread in it.Waffles stick to the waffle inserts and tear apart when opening it -- despite our best efforts at seasoning it with canola oil. I will check with the manufacturer for warranty help with this issue. (UPDATE: I shipped the unit to the manufacturer's repair facility and they replaced it.)"
4,"Very nice, but not perfect.","Out of 7 breakfasts a week we have pocket sandwiches at least 3-4 times, so i guess we like it. ut it took us time to learn to make goog sandwiches without hot cheese floating onto the counter top, as we like to put a tol of stuff iside. It's pretty easy to clean ( unless you have melted cheese all over the counter), so i would say it's a very useful thing in out kitchen. The ony thing i hate about it - it doesn't have on/off switch and plugging/unplugging the cord is really annoying. Oher than that - very good, would recommend."
5,Wonderful sandwich maker,I absolutely love this sandwich maker. The removable dishwasher safe trays are very convenient. We use it on a weekly basis. Good buy for your money.
3,At least better than her recent few,"I have to agree with previous reviews. This storyline was mediocre, somewhat boring, and one dimensional. Nell especially bored me. There were no undercurrents or tension or anything very complex like the emotions we experienced in Golden Girl or Guardian. I forced myself to finish this book, believing that it would improve. It didn't. And what happened to all the subtle humor JW used to sprinkle in her novels? At least this one was better than the disastrous last few contemporary novels JW wrote, as well as the historical White Horses which I thought was one of her worst romance novels yet."
2,Depressing,"Depressing . . . She has no one who loves her, he only has his grandfather. Later on in the book we find his father & mother. I don't want to give away the plot but this book I did not enjoy. I tried, several times . . . I thought it would be good but it just kept going back toward depressing situations. His father, her father, his adultery, never could get a feel for where this book was going. It ends with a good conclusion but I did not enjoy the ride."
4,John Harkes: A True American Success Story,"What can I say about this book? Well, I can tell you that it is an inspiring story about an American-born soccer player who with soccer in his blood, goes out and accomplishes his dream. He tells about how he grew up playing in the soccer crazed town of Kearny, New Jersey to honing his craft at the University of Virginia to taking his talents to the professional level in England and later back to his home country of the U.S.A. He tells about his triumphs and disappointments at all levels of his career. It's a great read for those who are soccer fans. When reading this book, I felt like I was actually there with Harkes as he tells the excitement of World Cup '94 and the disappointment when he was dropped from the U.S. National Team and did not make it to France in '98. I encourage fans of ""the greatest sport in the world"" to buy this book."
5,This book is awesome,"I've always admired John Harkes, but it wasn't completely clear to me why he was left out of the World Cup '98 squad. This book tells that story along with the rest of John's career. This book was so fascinating I read it all in two days. It is now one of my favorite books, I reccomend this book to anyone, Harkes-fan or not!"
1,Hmmm...2010 reveals...,"Let me start this review by stating that I have not read this book. As a soccer fan, it has always been on my list as one I would like to read, but after looking over several excerpts, particularly about the World Cup omission, something struck me as strange and very negative in his story, and I just never clicked the purchase button.This week Coach Steve Sampson and teammate Eric Wynalda revealed publicly that Harkes was dropped as both Captain and from the World Cup squad as he was having an affair with Wynalda's wife. I'm quite certain this was discussed with Harkes, along with other issues, as his reason for being dismissed. His confussion on why he was removed is uncalled for. Looks like time has shown Sampson and Wynalda to have taken the high road in what at the time could have become a complete embarrasment for Harkes.If you're going to write your autobiography, be honest, even if it doesn't show you in a favorable light."
4,Perfect fit,"These are a perfect fit on my CJ and just about right degree with a 4"" lift.Only got 4 stars since they are made out of Aluminum instead of the preferred steel."
5,Very satisfied,"I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I chose it because of the reasonable price and the oil-less design. The reconditioning is either very thorough or they started with one that was hardly used, because it is indistinguishable from new. I've only used 1"" staples so far, but at 90 lb. air pressure and with the adjustment on minimum, it drives them effortlessly and consistently to the same depth, and is a pleasure to use. It doesn't even make much noise. If I were a pro and was really going to use it a lot, one that uses 1/4"" wide staples instead of 7/32"" would probably be better, because 1/4"" staples are available in more stores and in wider variety, but at the rate I'll use them and with the rapid delivery from Amazon, that is a pretty trivial matter for me."
2,"Sorry, this one didn't do it for me!!!!","This is the second book for Jennifer Weiner. I had been waiting for this one for a long time as I adored ""Good in Bed"". Unfortunately, this book was NOT what I was hoping for. Although the writing style flows and can sometimes be witty, unfortunately, the storyline was boring. I just did not care about any of the main characters and in particular Rose.It seems to me this story has been told and retold before. Nothing new here."
2,If you don't have a sister-you might not like it.,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't get into this book at all, maybe it's because my only sibling is a brother? And he wasn't too interested in my shoes...There are no likeable characters in this novel-except for maybe Simon. I couldn't stand the main character-Rose. She is sooooo spineless! And her sister, Maggie is way too selfish to be real! And Rose finds any reason to excuse Maggie's horrible behavior. It's positively frustrating.I usually keep my books after I read them, but I sold this one Amazon!"
5,Better than Good in Bed,"I loved Jennifer Weiner's first book, ""Good in Bed"" and highly anticipated her 2nd. I disagree with most of the other reviewers here that this second effort was disappointing - in fact I think it was better than the first. I loved the way the characters of the two sisters changed over the course of this novel to embrace more of what they originally disliked about each other. The love story is sweet; the conclusion of the book is one of most satisfying I have read. I was truly disappointed when this book ended. I read 3 books a week and this was the best I've read this year - I really loved it."
3,Good not Great.,"This is my first Jennifer Weiner book and I had high hopes. My friend Sara said it was a good one...The book started on a risqué and yet high note. It made me chuckle a little bit and than at the same time as I read on a little sad. Maggie defiantly has some issues to have herself used the way she does. Reading further the relationship between Maggie and Rose touched a little bitclose to the relationship I share with my sibling. It is not exact and we are not set fully like the pair but I could defiantly relate and that does make the book a little closer to home for myself and probably others.While I found the book enjoyable it wasn't one that I couldn't put down. It was just okay. Not bad not good, just there. I got a little lost at some of the chapter switches but that could have been my own personal lack of focus. And while I did not think the book was fantastic I will be giving the author another shot and I will defiantly read some more of her books and see where they go."
4,On the Beach,"I read this book on my vacation to Jamaica. It was the perfect book to lay on the beach and read. It took me a few chapters to get into the book, but then I was home free. Loved it!"
3,In Her Shoes,"Not much to say about this book....It was good, at times It was bad, blah, blah, blah.I much rather read GOOD IN BED again then this book."
3,A movie type of book,"This book was enjoyable enough, but I felt like it was more like a movie script--written for mass appeal, predictable. There wasn't much depth to any of the characters. I wasn't bored, but I won't be reading it again, like I do most books I enjoy. I will probably see the movie, just because it seems like this book may be better as a movie--so I can see some emotion in the characters."
1,painful shoes,"I loved Good in Bed. I hate In her Shoes. Can't believe the difference between these two books. The story is choppy and nothing new or fresh is here. In fact, the main characters are downright unlikeable. Rose is not a character that we really get to know or care about, and Maggie is about the most horrid sibling ever. She goes beyond the point of redemption, and walks all over Rose to the point of ridiculousness. The book just veers way off course as it goes on, getting more and more unbelievable and cliched. The storyline with the grandmother does not work...seems like she was trying to appeal to as many demographics as possible and it just falls flat. I skimmed through these pages because they really didn't move the story forward. Overall, a big disappointment. I think this writer is capable of a lot more. Hopefully, her next book will be better, but I won't be buying that one in hardcover! Save your money on this book....not worth the $20!"
3,It was ok..,"This book was nothing like Good In Bed ( Which I think is one of the best books ever written), this book just lacked something. I found myself skipping pages...skimmimg unitl I found the story line I was looking for. Some parts were cute and I fell in love with Rose's character, but I just couldnt get into it."
3,Not as good as first book,I like Jennifer Weiner's writing but this book was not great at all. The challenges the characters faced were unrealistic. She could have dug deeper and made the characters more believeable. And the relationship with the long lost grandmother was anti-climatic. Better luck with Good in Bed. That bok was great.
5,Fantastic!,"I read Jennifer Weiner's second book In Her Shoes before I read her first book Good In Bed. As soon as I read In Her Shoes, I was hooked. I found the dynamics of this sister relationship intriguing. I continued to find myself reading ""just one page more"" because I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book and I'm looking forward to the moving coming out."
2,Oh Please!!,"I found this book ridiculously trite and predictable. The only character that was well thought out and represented in a believable way was Rose (not surprising as it seems that this author can only convincingly write about female characters that are based on herself). I was consistently annoyed with the characters in the book and more often than not my attention was drawn away from the story by the awful descriptions of the clothes the women wore (who wore a catsuit out of the house after 1992?) If you want to read a book that deals with sibling relationships in an original an entertaining manner, I suggest The Savage Girl by Alex Shakar."
3,Ho hum CD,"This CD wasn't all that in my opinion. I mean, it wasn't the worst thing Jeff has put out, but it's marginal at best."
2,Milk Toast Jazz Lite To Fall Asleep By,"5 Stars? What disc did you guys buy? This is the most careful, don't take a chance, leave your chops outside the studio disc I have heard in a while. It epitomizes cream puff light jazz where solos are strictly forbidden. The thing is, I know these guys can play better, but they sound like they have been told not to. Pity because some of the grooves are pretty good, they just don't go anywhere. I will keep this disc just in case I decide to install an elevator in my home, then I'll have the right music."
5,Where's the CD???!!,"I bought this on day one in '75. One of, if not the very best Lampoon musical parody albums they did. Why is this not on CD like most of the Lampoon catalog? Perhaps because those holding the pursestrings never settled with the estate of late-great singer-songwriter Tony Scheuren, who contributed a few tracks to Lampoon over his too-short career and life. His contribution to this album was the Neil Young parody ""Southern California Brings Me Down"" -- the best Neil Young song that Neil Young didn't write!"
3,Woops,I was not aware that there is more than 1 series of tenchi muyo. I bought this thinking it was the series i watched when i was a kid that i liked so much but it was actually something else. A little disapointed but its still good. Just another anime to add to the collection now.
5,Very Powerfull Supplement,I have been using this product not in a very constant way but nevertheless I have seen very good results in stamina and weight loss. I really recommend this.Flavor is very sweet (you need to mix it with just 8 oz of water) but is not bad.
2,sluggish/fatigued,"Item did not give me a pump/energy. The product did give me an upset stomach, sluggishness, gas, cramping... I take the product early in the morning on an empty stomach so that may have something to do with the issues that I am having."
5,Delicious and Effective,"I was skeptical before initially trying N.O. Shotgun. My first workout on it was awesome. I had insane pumps. Some of the product's critics claim that all you'll get is a pump: There is no long-term benefit to using the product. I disagree.I'm at my leanest ever. Every time I diet to these levels, my muscles are flat and I look like a waif. Since using N.O. Shotgun, I've kept my muscle density.It's also a powerful pre-workout stimulant. I drink it with several ice cubes into my shaker bottle. It tastes fantastic and gets me amped. This is especially necessary since I have a very stressful job. I drink Shotgun on the way to the gym and during my warm-up. After a few minutes on the treadmill or bike, I'm in ""workout mode.""This is the best pre-workout supplement I've ever taken. Highly recommended."
3,Good ... But!,The Astronaut Chocolate Ice Cream with Chocolate Chips tasted very good. I would have given this item a 5 star except for one problem. The paper wrapped in all of the items were ripped and the ice cream were in pieces. Thus the but!
1,Haskell couldn't review her way out of a wet paper bag,"I have trouble suppressing a chuckle at the ponderous, self-important titles of Haskell's review books. Despite the grandiosity of the title of this one--""Women and Men and Film and Feminists"": oh, is that all? Just those?--this book is not much more than simple recounting of the casts and the plots of movies she likes. You can probably get more critical information on the Lifetime or Oxygen websites. It's like she's turning film criticism into a parody of the institution itself. It's kind of sad that real feminist film critique has to be lumped in with this ""Dear Diary / Love Molly"" pablum. Oh, well. Maybe that means I can get *my* diary published!"
3,not bad for beginners,"I used this product for my dj gigs. I bought this product a year ago and I just blew my sub speaker which was at my expense. If you are just starting out, this is a great setup and it performs very well.. the sound quality isn't the best but its a cheap setup .. even though I'm replacing this setup with another system, I'm still getting a replacement sub and I will keep using this one for extra sounds or just for smaller cheaper gigs."
2,Disappointed,"I found the book started out really good. I was thinking to myself ""I really like this"", as the story was unfolding through the eyes of the people most affected by the murder.But after about half the book, something happened, it felt like the author lost interest and didn't know how to finish it. There was a stand still in the investigation and a stand still in the development of the characters. And the case was closed by a total fluke.I think Elisabeth Hyde can do much better next time!"
1,"Immature, unlikeable main character.","I was excited to read this book because the title indicated that it could be a compelling book. Instead, it was so boiler plate that I knew from almost the outset who was responsible and it was a chore to have to read through it just to find out what I already knew. Also, the characters were just dull or in the case of Meagan, annoying. The entire plot of her involvement in questioning a suspect was unbelievable. Actually, the entire book could have been a high school writing project."
3,Good short introduction,"Although Colin Wilson does engage in the occasional non sequitur, and is perhaps not always sufficiently critical about the implications of some of Gurdjieff's stories about his own life, this is still a good, workmanlike introduction to Gurdjieff's ideas, life and work. In the last chapter, Wilson critically, yet sympathetically, consider Gurdjieff's ideas. A good place to start, or just to get a feel, for a remarkable figure."
1,If you are easily betrayed ...,"Anyone who might believe that the men who don Mickey (or Minnie) outfits and dance around the World of Disney are all ex-college heterosexual football jocks, might also be shocked (and entertained) by this wasted ""journalism."" Corporate America is seldom what it seems, and Disney is a corporation."
1,Not worth the money!,"And yet another duo trying to cash in by using the Disney name. Don't waste your time on this book. Are all Disney cast members child molesters, rapists, con artists and virtual low lifes? I think not. Let this dynamic duo of ""authors"" make their money off of someone else's name."
3,Interesting,"This book, so far, is an interesting book. Although I haven't finished it yet, I find the information useful. The employee viewpoints and facts will make my next visit to Disney World a more cautious one."
3,Warning! Extreme conservatism ahead!,"Parts of this book are great. I loved reading about safety issues in the park, Disney pretty much running the surrounding area in Florida, the increasingly sexual nature of Disney heroines. There is so much wrong with Disney, the authors should have stuck with these true problems.However, it appears that there is an ultraconservative agenda beneath it all. The authors go on to ""expose"" Disney's ties to more mature films and alleged promotion of homosexuality. The case is not well presented for either. Also, the suggestion that a handful of child sex abuse charges against people with ties to the company means that the company is rampant with such persons is inflammatory and irresponsible. Child molesters are everywhere! Disney is not the problem.Had the authors stuck to legitimate claims, the book would have been much stronger."
3,Too Much Opinion Sullies Book,"The authors did a great job uncovering several seedy tidbits of info on Disney. I was pretty surprised at the ""New"" Disney. Their apparent lack of concern for serious crimes certainly betrays the public image of the company.I have to admit, I read this book with a pre-conceived idea of Disney - the company annoys me. Even diehard fans will admit that the company has strayed from Walt's original vision. My favorite chapter of the book detailed how Disney stole the Lion King.The book suffers when the authors' own conservative ideas creep into the sentences. It is way too clear that the authors probably lacked objectivity when they wrote this book.Overall, a decent book, but hardly a must-read."
1,The authors are full of it,"Note that this book appears on the web site for conservative books. That should be the first sign of how biased this book is. Like all conservatives do, the authors distort things to their own liking and try to brianwash the gullible public. If Disney employs homosexuals I think they should be applauded. No, I'm not gay nor do I agree with homosexuality but I believe in being fair. What made these authors mad is clearly that Disney is becoming increasingly liberal (which I think is a good sign) and are offended by all the positive advancements of the Co. Don't waste your money, if you belive what this book says then you might as well believe that 4+4=13!"
1,Pure Trash,This book was written by two individuals with an obviously tainted agenda.I bought this book and returned it the same day!Disney fans look elsewhere!
1,journalism so shoddy it must be called opinion,"Disney has 51,000 employees and 17 million visitors annually at Walt Disney World alone, but only two or three incidences of assault against children could be uncovered by reporters following the Schweizer's leads.This book is clearly shaped more by the Schweizers' desire to see the world look more like the 1950s than the 1990s than it is by real people's experiences with the Disney Company. If they insist on referring to it as journalism, it is frightfully bad journalism at best.The one star is for entertainment value."
5,This Is A Must Read!,Terrific techno-thriller. The books zips along at a brisk and exciting pace without losing anything by way of intelligence. A rare find.
2,not their best effort,"too many punk bands that weren't very good in the first place attempted to make the hardcore/metal crossover, only to end up sucking even worse. this album is one of those..."
1,you suck,where is my lighter fluid?????? i hate you guys cause you did not give me any lighter fluid with my zippo....never again....
2,Evaporates constantly,"Save your money and buy Ronson lighter fluid instead. I have a Zippo, and I pretty much have to refill it every time I use it now. I used to use Ronson fluid, but moved and couldn't find it locally, so I bought Zippo fluid instead. The Ronson lasts weeks between refills. I won't be buying this again."
2,An odd theory in book form,"What kills John E. Walsh's book is that he spends the first half of his book debunking others for their half-cooked theories on Poe's death and their basis on speculation rather than evidence. The second half of the book is Walsh's own half-cooked theory on Poe's death based on speculation rather than evidence. What does save this book is that it does give a fairly good overview of the wide spectrum of theories on Poe's death. Stop about halfway through, and it's a fairly decent, readable book.And to the ""doc"" who posted: many doctors have considered this case over the past 150 years and each has come up with a different final answer. His alcoholism is not a fact and is in wide dispute, and he may have been sober for at least a year before his death. Case closed...? If so, we wouldn't have entire books, like this one, trying to solve the case."
5,"OUTSTANDING, OUTSHINING, INCREDIBLE","LOOK, I DON't NEED TO WRITE ANY FANCY DESCRIPTION OR ANYTHING LIKE I DO FOR OTHER CD'S. ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS IF YOU BUY THIS YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.THERE ARE 2CD's OF SOME OF THE MOST INGENIOS MUSIC EVER RECORDED AND ALTHOUGH I LOVE EVERY SONG ON THIS, I CAN GUARANTEE YOU, THERES SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE HERE...."
5,"The demonic, apocalyptic sibling of ""24""...","Like the finest work of Stephen King, Skipp and Spector establish a fine ensemble of characters and make us feel for them, knowing that any one of them could be the next to suffer a horrific demise.The characters are unaware that nothing will be the same after the events in the book, unaware that their world is slipping away...The book is disturbing, gruesome and impossible to put down. Once this book's tendrils ensnare you, God help you if you have other things that need to get done.""The Bridge"", arguably Skipp and Spector's finest work as a team, is a modern classic, proving them to be more than mere ""splatterpunks."" With this book, they cemented a place for themselves amongst horror's elite."
3,Grand Warfare of Impotence,"This book is ambitious which is great. My main problem is that it is rambling. The author seems to want to paint a great canvas of Medieval Warfare but every time be begins to reach a crescendo he retreats into a dialogue of minutiae that has nothing to do with the over riding theme.This book has a catalog list of battles, tribes and tactics. Too bad they are not connected. I found his writing style very difficult to stay interested.I also found the lack of Mongol History in the book interesting. The Mongols had excellent strategies for dealing with Islamic jihadists. What no description here.Clarence"
5,I am glad I bought the Omaha Indian Music: Hethu'shka Songs 2-CD Set.,"""These CDs should be used to teach the present and future generations about our variegated American heritage. The Omaha Indians have been relegated to the sidelines and are largely ignored today, but we walk on the soil they safeguarded against intruders before we came along. Their music reflects this, and the pride and pathos is unmistakable. I'm glad I bought the Omaha Indian Music: Hethu'shka Songs 2-CD Set."""
1,Does not last very long,"I read the reviews and decided to give this product a try despite the ratings because it was inexpensive. I learned my lesson. I love the design, it fits in the car cup holders, it's easy to clean because my hand can easily reach to the bottom to wash it out. However, I bought three of these and the bottom fell off of every one of them within a short time, and that caused them to leak. They are all in the trash now."
2,Very cheap,I bought this right here to replace a mug that looked exactly like this one. The one I had was stainless inside too however. This one is plastic inside. The inside plastic does not keep the coffe warm for long. Fair enough you can see that in the pic. The bigger problem with this cup is the lid. The hole to let air into the cup is way to small and covered up by the sliding clip on top. This makes it very difficult to get coffee out of the cup without sucking. I found I had to take the lid off to finish my coffee -- by than to drink was pretty cool and I just put it in a ceramic cup to finish my drink.
1,Beware,"I bought the individual volumes 1 & 2. Combined, they have the exact same run time as the Complete Series set according to Amazon. However, the episode ""Imprint"" is not included in either volume. I wrote to Starz/Anchor Bay and they claim it IS on the big set. What a ripoff! It's bad enough they said they'd never release the full season in order to sucker people into buying the original individual releases. Now they pull this nonsense."
4,Nady RPA-6,"This portable sound system is just what we needed to take to a church gym to announce basketball games. It does everything we need and the volume is actually enough for that large of a space. It wouldn't handle a rock concert, but for announcements and playing the typical jock jams music in the background, it works great. When we're done we just wheel it out to the car. We can also use it around the church for meetings or to provide sound for a video or movie with a video projector."
4,",,","I found this book really enjoyable, though i believe the first book has better. With more action and everything."
4,Fun At The Race Track,"In SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN Nick starts out to clear one of his reporter friends who has been accused of murder. The killing is actually the work of the syndicate and is connected to racetrack gambling.William Powell and Myrna Loy return in the starring roles and they are supported by another large cast which includes Barry Nelson, Sam Levene, Donna Reed and Stella Adler. Dickie Hall appears as Nick Charles, Jr. who is now old enough to talk.W.S. Van Dyke serves as director for the last time in the series since he died before the next entry was filmed in 1944. Van Dyke will be remembered for his direction of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald in ROSE-MARIE and NAUGHTY MARIETTA."
3,nwobhm reissue......and bonus tracks,a cool band from the early 80s to have their cdreissued by metal blade with bonus tracks[cool] if you like the oldies in metal and looking for some thing to pick up then this is a safe bet.songd let it loose kicks it off cool song and china run one of my favs so if your sick of hearing metallica pull of these classic covers and want to hear it done right pick up all of the metal blade re issuse coming out.
5,A is for Abomination! H is for Hulk! H & A are for Hugely Awesome!,"This is the best Hulk book I own! Abomination is my # 1 favorite Hulk villain of all time, Hulk is my 5th favorite comic book hero topped only by Punisher, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Tigra, the art and writing is excellent, the hate, love, rage, friendship, and will in the book are solid, the suspense and intensity is out of this world-NUFF SAID! GET THIS COMIC IF YOU ARE A HULK FAN! HULK COMICS DO NOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS! YOU WILL HAVE SPENT YOUR MONEY ON A WORTHY ITEM! END OF STORY!"
3,Super Reader,"A female Grendel is the last of her clan. The rest of them committed suicide when the Grendel ruler was assassinated by his lover, as they had failed in their duty.Susan, however, took and different path, and went looking for the mightiest and incorruptible Paladin, the Grendel Prime.The various Grendel states have degenerated, so plenty of problems just staying alive to try and start bringing some order back to things."
2,Not sure what the fuss is all about,"I was disappointed with this game. The reviews I read before I played rated it very high, as starting a new genre, etc. I found it stilted, predictable, and rather boring. Some of the clues just screamed at you; Phoenix would have to be a halfwit not to take note of them. The graphics were cartoonish and childish. Don't waste your time or money."
5,A must read for anyone with hepatitis C,"The Hepatitis C Help Book is a collaboration between two of the best known and most knowledgeable practitioners working in the hepatitis field today - Misha Cohen O.M.D.,LAc. and Robert Gish, MD. This is a well-rounded and comprehensive guide that should be in the personal library of anyone dealing with hepatitis C, and can easily be used by both patients and health care providers. Highly Reocommended."
3,Have to try it once,"After numerous opportunities, I tried out an Anders Osborne product. Perhaps this wasn't representative. It certainly wasn't impressive. Unless there is more to Osborne than the formulaic approach to blues exhibited here, I won't need to try it twice."
5,i would gladley pay a buck for each tip,"When you consider the time and aggrivation these tips save you at the bench, you cant really say its overpriced. i have been a student at revere academy and know what people are willing to sacrfice in time emotion and finance to learn this information in person. this feels like pennies to me in comparison. i use these tips everyday and it must be said, i am a better and more efficient jeweler for it.if even one tip out of this book saves you time on a piece of jewelry then you have already paid for your book. this is not fluff that will look pretty on your shelf with high end photos of fantastic jewelry.... that was saved for other books. this is the real deal actual useful information you can use right away. as for the adverts in the back? they are great resources and im happy to have the information. these are companies that endorse revere academy and are endorsed by revere academy, not just random folk who wanted to buy adds in a book."
3,Way to big,I must have missed something on the products details. I was expecting something smaller. I still liked it. But it is not an average size. The only thing is it will take longer to cook.
5,Nestor Torres wins a Grammy,Congratulations to Mr. Torres for winning a Latin Grammy for his CD This Side of Paradise. It is the most beautiful mix of grooves I've ever heard. This man makes the flute sing!
5,Love the plot,"I like the new take on Resident Evil Capcom has decided to go with. This is unlike any resident evil I have ever played. Killing ""Zombies"" is actually a part of the storyline and you even get points for doing it. The upgrades you get from the merchant are nice. And even though there is a lack of the T-virus, I still get a sense of fear and terror from all new villains and monsters.I can't wait to try this on the wii, because the PS2 version is stil pretty fun."
3,Could have great...,"Although the gameplay and graphics are fantastic it lacks the post-apocalyptic feel of Resident Evil 3 or the stark reality of Code Veronica X but what really disappoints is the terrible dialogue. After periods of edge-of-your-seat gameplay some of the things Leon (the main character) comes out with are real mood spoilers, caricatures of the very worst action films, almost to the point of comedy (which isn't intended). This is important because this kind of game is all about mood and anything that spoils the mood spoils the whole game.That aside its a great addition to the series and one that will keep fans playing for hours. That said, If Capcom were to invest in proper writers this would have deserved 5 stars and be one of the best of its kind."
3,fun for awhile but it will get boring,I was excited when I first bought this game but after beating it 3 times. And unlocking everything I really don't want this game anymore
4,"Hot game, really no complaints","I am going to keep this short and sweet. The gameplay is realistic enough and fun, you can't move and shoot but no biggie cuz most of your opponents move slow when they are close. The weapon selection is great, the difficulty is challenging but ridiculous, the story line is cheesy as F#$k but once again who cares when you can blow a guys head off..."
5,incredible horror game,"This game is incredible. I can't even count how many times I have been scared out of my wits playing this! There are a lot of freaky unexpected surprises, and nothing is ever predictable or repetitive. Basically, it's scary and will get your adrenaline going.This is probably one of the best horror/action games around. High re-play value."
1,the gamecube version is much better...,"if you are thinking about picking this up i'd go for the nintendo gamecube version over this one. the graphics look much better and it plays smoother on the 'cube (plus playing on the gamecube means you can use the best video game accessory ever made= the ultra-dope wavebird wireless controller) . the game was designed for the gamecube, and the weird architecture of the ps2 didn't help the shifting over from that console. the game itself is fantastic but be aware that it is much better on the gamecube."
1,horrible,"why is this game being reviewed so well? i thought it was horrible, the game is frightenly repetitive, it gets boring after the first level. I thought it was a failure and forever scared me away from resident evil. my advice is to stay away!! horiblle, HORIBLE GAME!"
1,Terribly Dissappointed,"After numerous attempts to fly this plane, it refuses to take off the ground, acts more like a remote control car than a plane. After hand throwing the plane, it stays in the air for maybe 2 minutes and then crash lands. The material easily breaks. The foam is not sturdy. I strongly suggest you not buy this product. I'm only sorry you cannot return this product."
3,Inexpensive and elegant watch,"Inexpensive watches that don't look cheap are hard to find. This is one of the few inexpensive elegant watches out there. The watch has a very simple design, is very subdued and fairly small.It looks good against paler arms, and with darker dresses.Interestingly, there is a diamond at the 12 o'clock position. At under $20 I suspect this is an artificial diamond, but who's looking?UPDATE: I reduced this to 3 stars because the face plate is weak. Under normal use the faceplate got scratched and then cracked. Otherwise the watch was very promising."
3,Where has all the steel gone?,"I am so disappointed in Tonka--namely Hasbro. I bought the TS4000 truck for 20.00 at Toys R' Us first and despite the reviews, I ordered the Classics from Amazon, because the only steel part on the TS400 was the yellow dumper.I was hoping that the ""classics"" truck would have more steel parts. My brother's late 1980's Tonka dump truck was all steel except for the wheels and the grill.Here is the difference between the TS4000 and the Tonka Classics--NOTHING except the size. The classics truck is bigger than the TS4000. Still, the only steel part is the dumper.I am returning the classics truck. I wouldn't have minded paying double for a toy made like they made them in the old days."
4,"My old nemesis, back to its former glory","How gratified I was to see the metal Tonka dumptrucks available to a new generation.My twin brother had one when we were tots in the late 70's, and he neatly demonstrated its extreme durability of construction and mobility of the parts by seizing the lip of the cargo tray, whipping it around like a nunchaku, and hitting me in the face with the hood of the truck. If parents have doubts about the durability of the toy, let me assure you that the cartilage of my nose yielded before that truck ever would. At 35, I still bear a deep scar across my septum from this fine product.The child I intend it for today has no siblings as yet, but as an old master of Tonka-fu (the fire truck with extensible ladder makes an excellent weapon for blocking and tangling, I later found), I intend to train him well in the use of this toy. This proud martial arts tradition shall not die out in my time."
3,IT'S OKAY BUT IT LACKS THE INTEREST A READER LOOKS FOR.,I WAS NOT IMPRESS WITH IT. NEEDS A LITTLE MORE SPICE SO WE CAN FEEL THE FLAVOR.
4,moist heat neck rest,This product sat on the shoulders better than the other neck style but it's drawback is that it does not retain heat as well as another product I have used.
3,My experience with the DSC-S60,"The camera has very good software to manipulate it, it's very very easy to use. Because I didn't read before I buy this camera i didn't see that the box don't bring rechargeable batteries and of course the charger neither. The camera takes very good pictures but you can't move because the picture don't see very well, it's very annoying in a good time to see your photos move it. I always buy sony and I would like to say that this camera it's very good all the time, but no, for me it's better spend more money and to buy, for example, the Sony DSC-W5, until now this is a very good camera for me. I hope this opinion help you people."
4,Son Loves It!,"My son loves the book and now loves Ernie too. It's short, to the point, and is easily understood by a two year old. The only negative feedback that I have about this book is that it keeps saying ""Ernie goes"" or ""Ernie has to go"" and isn't more specific than that. It's too easily misunderstood by a child who is used to going somewhere or going bye bye. Adults say ""I have to go."" frequently, but he has always heard ""go potty"" ""go pee pee and poo poo"" or ""make pee pee and poo poo"". So, anytime that it says Ernie ""goes"", I read it as ""goes pee pee and poo poo"". It also says that Ernie unsnaps his pants and goes. My son has never worn a pair of pants with a snap, so he has no idea what that means. And, in reality, just unsnapping your pants is leaving off a major step: the pulling down of the pants. I don't want my kid to unsnap his pants and go, I want him to get his pants all the way down and then go. So, in lieu of ""unsnaps his pants"", I say ""pulls down his pants""."
2,Potty Book for 2-1/2 year old son,"I bought this book for my son to read while potty training, he enjoys it but it is extremely vague in the actual process of what goes into the potty training process. For example it skips from Ernie got a new potty to when Ernie ""has to go"" he sits on the potty and ""goes"". I pretty much don't even read the words but rather am descriptive for my son, I will read it ""when Ernie has to pee-pee or poopie"". I would not recommend this as a real learning experience for your child, but as I said my son does enjoy looking at it."
1,"It's a baby's book, not a toddler's book","The topic of potty training is very much appropriate for a 2+ year old but the book is not written at a 2+ year old's level. This is very much a baby's book. I guess it would be good if you wanted to start exposing your baby to the broad concept of a potty. As far as using this book as a teaching tool to help potty train a toddler, forget it."
3,It didn't help me,"I have bought this book when my son was 2 years, but it didn't help alot. However as a book it is very attractive and full of fun and I think it may help in case the toddler is ready for training so is will motivate him."
4,Great Book!!,"I really like this book. My daughter got it for her first birthday, because I want her to be aware of potty training for a while before she does it. She is very interested in this book. I also like that it teaches them to wash their hands when they are finished. Would reccomend to people who are potty training little ones. Also very reasonably priced."
2,OK but not as helpful as I had hoped,"This book is very short and not as instructive as I had hoped. My son likes it, but, it hasn't gotten the message through."
4,"Cute, Short Potty Book","This is a cute book about Ernie growing up from a baby to a big boy. It's best feature is talking about leaving toys/playtime to run to the potty. My 2 1/2 year old son had it memorized by about the 3rd reading and requests this book often. This is not an in-depth potty training book for kids but rather an ""easy read"" to help motivate your child to use the potty chair."
1,We are NOT amused,"I've a VERY large bone to pick with Laurie R. King with regard to her new Kate Martinelli mystery (The Art of Detection) which I'd been anticipating for years. Mind you, I read and enjoyed the first two or three Mary Russell Holmes novels, then tired of the trope entirely. Kate, however, has been a constant if often shrill delight. So, what do I find in the new Kate? Sherlock Holmes, that's who. Not ONLY is the mystery centered on a Holmes theme but there's a pastiche Holmesian novela taking up about a third of the book.We are not amused. We may never again trust King."
2,Missed the target,"I have read and loved all of the Kate Martinelli mysteries, until this one. It went well until the ""Sherlock Holmes"" manuscript was wedged in. After that, the book became dull and predictable, with the only bright spot being at the very end, when Kate and her partner Lee were whisked off to city hall for an impromptu wedding."
3,Doesn't Live Up to Its Promise,"Because I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes and also of Laurie R. King, I was eager to read this book. Perhaps it's wrong to have great expectations for a book, even based on good reviews, for I found this one of the most disappointing King books I've read. In general I enjoy when a plot jumps forward and backward in time, but the way it was done here didn't hold my interest. I found the past more interesting than the present. The book seemed to move at a slow pace, perhaps a victim of its structure and intentions. And, as another reviewer has mentioned, the ending didn't feel satisfying because there's hasty, perhaps faulty, thinking on the part of Kate Martinelli. I would recommend any of the Mary Russell books over this one."
4,Was exactly what I needed,"We had found a power wheels jammin Barbie Jeep by the trash in our neighborhood. My wife talked me into picking it up and having a look at it. We took it home, cleaned it up, painted it. Then, needed a replacement battery because the old would not hold a charge. Ordered this battery here and, once charged it has worked perfectly. The kids love it!!!"
5,Great deal,Fantastic deal! Was looking for new battery for awhile not and came across this. So glad we found one for our son's four wheeler toy. that thing is ten years old and still runa great just needed a new batey for it. now my younger boys are able to ride it.
3,No good without a charger!,"IF YOU DONT HAVE A CHARGER, THIS PRODUCT IS NO GOOD! AFTER BUYING IT, I STILL HAD TO GO AND PURCHASE A SEPARATE ITEM, ITS CHARGER. I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING IN THE PRODUCT INFORMATION THAT TOLD ME THAT WHEN I bought it!"
1,"For unimaginative, noncommunicative couples","A series of meant to be erotic stories. However, they're told as though by people who are ashamed to talk about sex, which wasn't much of a turn-on. All phallus were ""big"". How imaginative is that?! If you're someone who can't talk about it with your partner, this may be a place to start. There is a lot better material out there. Go, get it."
5,G.G. old stuff rules!,"This album rocks if you like low-fi style bubblegum punk. Before G.G. became totally unhinged he recorded what I consider to be several pop-punk classics. The Jabbers were a good band that G.G. purposely overshadowed. I also like the the early G.G. whiney vocals and immature lyrics. Some of the tracks are really good, and the rest are so bad they are good."
3,Too small,"I was looking for a small pie for 2 people or so. thinking this can be a perfect size, but I don't know whether Amazon sent me the wrong size or maybe 5in pie pan is that small! It's just a personal pie sized pan, nothing special. So I do not feel the prize was worth it. Now I have to go buy one that's actually big enough."
2,High Pitch was irritating. Enjoyed the first 10 Minutes...,"Ok, when the film started I was really liking it. It then SLOWLY drags on downhill. About 85% of this film takes place in a Police Caravan watching the lead actor sitting and bored. I share your pain...The lead Actor was good although he appeared as if he would rather be elsewhere. Basically what you have is a Killer, a young Policeman with a high pitched ringing in his Ears which frankly had me mute the film a couple of times and a long drawn out investigation that leads nowhere! The only action was in the first and last scenes. I generally like the Australian films but this was a regrettable purchase. :("
2,Star Trek Game,This game wasn't quite what I expected it to be. The game is not as user friendly as the Elite Force and other Star Trek games I have played. The graphics are slow and hang up from time to time which makes game play harder. I know for a fact it is not my graphics card. I think the technology is just older. Graphics were nice and there were cool features of the game. Just not quite what I expected.
4,"Good, A Solid Shooter","First off: I would like to give this game 3 and 1/2 stars but that is not possible. Its a pretty good game but it does have some negative characteristics.Pros: The level designs were great, very pretty. You do get to explore DS9 itself. You get to run around inside the Defiant, which was pretty cool. The use of the Tricorder in the game was a neat idea. Modulating phasers; another cool idea. You have the option to play as one of 3 characters, each character has a different series of adventures. People and things ""blows up real good""; nice damage effects. The game ran fine on my machine (I have a 3Dfx card). This is always a plus, ha-ha.Cons: Avery Brooks didn't supply his distinctive voice to the game. Too bad! In my opinion, some of the levels were too difficult at times. I spent too much time walking around in circles for no good reason. Some of the levels turned into ""find the key"" adventures. I'm tired of that little game plot device!"
4,"Merry Andrew, wonderful old movie","I had sen this movie when I was about 10. it had an infectious silly little tune....I bought this movie to see if I remembered it, and I did.....Danny Kaye in all his silliness"
3,other ways to start with La Piaf...,"I've bought this DVD in Brussels, Belgium in the european version, which is region2. There is no dubbing in it, so if you care for that and understand French, that's a possibility.It's title in french is ""UNE VIE DE PASSIONS""and even has an hour extra footage.There is NO english talking in it at all !Also : nowadays it's not too strange to buy a dvd-player which is region FREE! If you have on , than buy a GRRREAT Piaf DVD , titled ""L'HYMNE À LA MOME "" on EMI:7243 599030-9(5) , which has20 (!) songs by Piaf, from all parts of her career,including some very rare film clips in which she sings too. Even some of the clips are in color! Now THIS is worth buying for any fan, it's beautifully made and a real treasure.This DVD also has lots of extra's ,like over one hour private home movies and 10 minutes film-news clips. Hope to have been of any help for the fans here!"
4,pensieri da Staciella,"E un vero piacere per me quando ascolto a chisto disco perche le canzoni mi fanno ricordare Sicilia. Ma chisto disco manca solamente una canzone speciale, ""E Bruciata La Terra."" 'Sta canzone era cantata dal figghiu di Michele quando sono in Sicilia. Chista canzone e una canzone di Sicilia antica, rappresenta la cultura siciliana, e veramente e una canzone beddissima."

5,4.1 mega pixs,"I feel I got a good deal on this camera through Amazon...149 bucks out the door and the quality is exactly what I thought it woulkd be. Came quick, too.Bobby"
4,"Like camera, need better instructions in user guide.","This is my first digital camera and I am loving it. It is very easy to use and I am happy with the quality of pictures. Sometimes the directions in the user guides are a little vague. Figuring out what to do for different uses would be faster and easier if the directions were clearer. Also, being a new user of digital cameras, knowing which memory sticks are compatible with this camera is confusing to me."
5,just what i needed,"i wanted a camera that wouldn't be too clunky to carry in my purse, but i also didn't want it to have too little ppi capability. this is perfect. great pictures, great mobility."
3,A very comprehensive book in the related area.,"A very detail book of Music from period before 300 A.D to the beginning of Music Renaissance. Concepts are often illustrated with musical examples and with historical background provided.It is written in a style apt for advanced music students. Not recommended for amatuer and even music student who want to learn the ""basics"" of Medieval Music"
1,How to fold a wife beater?,"I was getting ready to order this book, when I checked out her website. She has many videos on how to fold various articles of clothing. One is entitled, ""How to fold a wife beater."" There are so many other terms she could have used, IE tank top, muscle shirt, etc. But she chose one that is offensive, low class & certainly not professional. I've since chosen not to purchase her book."
2,McDojo in a Box,"This is a joke! No one can ""earn"" a black belt through home study. I can only assume that the other reviewers are either shills for Freddie or are seriously deluded. From what I have seen of Fred's ""style"" I can give it two stars for being at least a form of physical exercise. If you really want to learn to defend yourself or learn a martial art save your money and find a decent school. [...]"
2,Fairly predictable.,"Not much of a mystery. You know who the bad guys are as soon as they are introduced. The main character is a putz.If you want a much, much more interesting read about game wardens, try the non-fiction stories by Terry Hodges. The real life adventures of game wardens in his books are 100 times more engaging than this."
4,Great story,"What a great story! If you enjoy the outdoor activities like hunting & fishing, you will really enjoy this story. I can't wait to read his other books. I like to read them in the order written."
1,Positive reviews?,"I used the reviews here to influence my decision to buy this book. I should have read the negative ones. Although I think there probably were some people who liked this book, I don't believe the positive reviews. This was one of the worst books I have ever tried to read. Uninteresting characters, including Joe Pickett and a story I could just not get into. Download a sample if possible and make an informed decision."
2,not that good,"I almost stopped reading Open Season after the first half as I tired quickly of the cardboard characters and slow plot. The story recovered in the second half. I did not appreciate the misspellings, ""is"" for ""his"", or the injured character who was dead on the next page but then alive in the following chapters."
2,Did I read the same book?,"I admit it, I was sucked in by the hype. There is nothing original in this book, other than the fact that the main protagonist is a game warden. The writing is average, at best, and the plot and characters are predictable. I am mystified by all of the good reviews. Don't waste your time."
2,Why are the reviews so good?,"I tried this novel based on other reviews, which I have come to depend on when buying from amazon. In this case I was disappointed! Joe is likable enough, but the plot is predictable, there is gratuitous sex, and I was bored. Don't bother reading this one."
5,state of emergency,"i have been a huge fan of die form for many years now, and i am totally blown away by this cd single, rain of blood. the music makes my heart skip a beat. this is one of those cds that touches you in a way you have never been touched. the song, rain of blood, off of dulaity, is one of my all time favorite die form songs, plus the other tracks found on this single are equally mezmerizing. it isn't too often that i come across a cd that has such an impact on me emotionally. if you are a fan of die form, you must buy this cd.. and if you are not a die form fanatic, you should be! die form takes gothic/industrial/fetish music to a whole new level. it is like nothing i have ever heard before."
1,"Skip this one, even if you like the VSI series","This book is neither very short nor a proper introduction. In this case, the title is totally misleading.With respect to length, the book drones on and on, and took me a surprisingly long time to finish considering the modest number of pages.With respect to being an introduction, the author seems more interested in showing his expertise rather than guiding those new to the subject. He spends a lot of time on esoterica, while failing to clearly present the basics of linguistics.For a truly good introduction, I suggest ""Teach Yourself Linguistics"" by Aitchison, which is well organized, concise, and covers all of the basics. Also check out the excellent audio/video linguistics courses offered by ""The Teaching Company."""
2,Mediocre,"Amateurish cover art, poor editing, uninteresting characters. I've read almost everything in the genre of eschatological fiction and I have to say this is ultimately very skippable. Read We All Fall Down by Brian Caldwell or The Christ Clone Trilogy by James Beausigneur instead...there's a reason those titles keep popping up over and over as exemplary.I actually got about 10 pages from the end of this and thought 'You know what? I don't actually care enough about what happens to finish' and set it down.The main character stands out as particularly generic...how many hard-bitten, coffee-drinking reporters have we read about over the years?"
5,Not To Be Missed!,"If you are a fan of guitar, if you are a fan of gospel, if you are a fan of music from the heart, and you haven't heard this disc, you owe it to yourself to set things right. I was lucky enough to have been at the convention documented here, and believe me, this is the cream of an extraordinary crop of songs heard over the weekend. You'll hear a typically dynamic and virtuosoic performance by The Campbell Brothers, a young Robert Randolph (who declared his intention to be rich and famous), and many musicians who play only in the church - and there's not a dud among them. This isn't music to sit quietly and nod off to. It's music to stand up and be moved by - soul-stirring music in every sense of the phrase."
3,"Before their peak, with flashes of work to come","I'm a serious EST fan and came to this album late, after much exposure to their later work. So, I hear this as something like ""they hadn't quite matured yet"". But some parts are really interesting, and there are some styles and techniques that don't show up in more recent recordings, and I'm really glad I have this. As a part-time student of jazz bass in general, and Dan Berglund in particular, I listen to something by EST every week, and Winter in Venice is in my listening rotation."
3,Great mixing fork...,The fork itself is great but they aren't kidding about the hand washing. It went thru the dishwasher once and all of the silver coating washed off!! Now its a dull gun metal gray....
5,worth the money,Fans of season 1 and 2 will like season 3 just as much if not more. The only complaint is that disc #5 (commentary disc) won't play in my dvd player
3,"Not the original members, but still good.","Buyer beware. Contrary to what some reviews/lists on amazon say, this isn't the original line-up of Sweet Savage. This was recorded in the nineties without Vivian Campbell. The remaining original members are all present, however and despite the very digital production, these songs are all solid NWOBHM. They stick with their vintage set list, so this is still worthwhile to those curious about this band's history. To my knowledge they only did one recording with the original line-up. That single is long since out of print and it would have been nice to see it included here, but ah well."
2,Disapointed,This disc I thought had Vivian Campbell on every track and it did not.Some of it is weak.Plus some of the songs are missing that later became Dio tracks.Checkout my band Curse Of Disobedience also.
3,Fun toy didn't last long.,"My kids enjoyed this while it worked, but it only lasted a month or so and then it wouldn't work anymore."
1,Horrible Excuse for a Study Guide,"This book does not even deserve 1 star. There is an error on almost every page of this book. I have included examples of some of the errors I found.Example from page 3,""1970-to Present Trends-Preventative medicine, wellness, physical fitness, and education that is more scholarly, more specialized, and more applicable to all segments of population such as elderly, handicapped persons, and those out ofUpon turning the page I found there is no more information provided to finish this statement.Example from Page 6,""Cognitive Development Goal: (Idealism philosophy)-deals with acquiring knowledge and ability to thing and interpret the knowledge.""On page 93, the definition of Muscular Endurance is mislabeled as Muscular Strength.If you enjoy editing other people's work then maybe this study guide is cut out for you."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This is a cute idea, but a very poor quality product. The edible glue didn't work very well, but we managed to get the seeds on the cardboard. My 8 year old daughter made one, and hung it in a tree, anxious to watch the birds dig in. We never saw a single bird come near it. Not even the squirrels were interested! The first rain destroyed it. My daughter was very disappointed after all the work she put into it. We never bothered to make the second feeder in the kit."
1,SAD- Did not get what I ordered,"I ordered this and did not get what was pictured in the ad.I did not Recieved the book or cover with the cd. When I went to install this on my computer I had problems. I called up Quickbooks to get help becuase non of the help features would work, They told me to return this cd becuase they did not support 2006 and 2007 any more. I email the the seller to return the next day and he would not give me a return. His ad said that would accept return with in 7 day of purchase which he did not hold to."
3,Quickbooks Pro,"Not a user friendly program. Requires a good understanding of business accounting. Difficult for beginners. Does not come with a comprehensive ""how to"" manual. But still, it is a good accounting program."
2,Love QB but 2006 has been nothing butheadaches,"My company has been using QuickBooks for at least 5 years and up until the 2006 release has only really had problems when we upgraded for about a day getting the file converted. We loved QB and it has worked well for us. Until 2006. This software has been one bug, glitch, or problem after another. Many of the customer/vendor search options are gone. But mostly there are so many bugs. Every time we sign in we are always told we have paychecks to send, EVERY TIME-even when we don't which is 90% of the time. Our friendly reminders (i.e. Don't forget your W-2s) never go away, even when we say it is done. We can not create an accountants copy from our computers anymore- now it is only from the server. There have been more problems but these are just what I have been dealing with this week. Qb is a great program but 2006 sucks!!!"
3,"Somehow, Quickbooks 2006 install crashed Windows XP","While installing our new Quickbooks 2006, we began getting error messages (""can't copy DLL file""). So, pressed the abort key (offered by the installation software). Quickbooks installer then showed that it was uninstalling itself. The system hung and then, rebooting the machine, we were shocked to find that Windows XP had been damaged and would no longer function (hangs during boot). The hard drive, etc. are fine, as we can access the computer over our network, but XP won't boot fully.Of course, Quicken (India) refused to take responsibility and we are forced to take the computer in for service ($125) or just reinstall Windows and all programs on this machine (4 hours of work plus some minor lost data)."
5,Hard To Find In Our Area,"For years, my mom has kept some of these in a bowl in the living room. My niece and nephews go crazy for these (I do too). For some reason they became difficult to find in our neighborhood. Thanks Amazon, we have our silly little treat back again."
4,Lucky to find the replacement!,We visited my parents last Christmas and they gave my little boy a Kawasaki Power Wheels Bike by them. I Charged the battery and when we returned home we lost the charger. The battery lasted a lot so I was looking for the charger and the Amazon description (color of the batteries and the Voltage) helped me a lot. The new charger arrived and it also has some recommendations so we the parents do not forget when charging the battery. The charger worked perfectly fine. I recommend this product and its seller.
4,Classic Cuban conjunto sounds with a New York salsa twist.,"Johnny Pacheco returns to the conjunto sound on this CD.Hector Casanova's powerful yet laid-back vocals and improvisations add plenty of spice. I can't give this a 5-star rating because the track ""Prestame Los Guantes"" condones domestic violence (you should just hit the skip button on your CD player when it comes).Otherwise a great CD from a salsa legend."
5,Loved this tube,"Its big enough for 3 average size men. It has good handles and a ridge on each side so you can brace yourself with your leg. It will submarine with a slow start and if your leaning forward, which we did on purpose because it was so much fun."
4,So far so good,"Just like others have stated, at the beginning, this float can sink. When the kids got used to it, it is fun to play. The material looks and feels tough."
1,Wrong item...,"I ordered this item twice, because the first one I ordered was not a Red Lobster, but a Green Turtle was sent instead. The second one that arrived was also a turtle instead of a lobster. This an item offered by another seller (911DRUGSTORE) and fulfilled by Amazon, so the shipping was quick, but the stock is wrong, so I let them know about the problem and they're checking on it. You might want to give them a little time to correct their stock before ordering this item."
3,"A step forward, but not all there","This book doesn't quite live up to its title, but is nonetheless a significant step forward in the literature of web technology. It is one of the first books to treat the building of web sites as an exercise in software engineering, and is strong in describing how to apply an organized development methodology to the construction of a web site. Given that most Web books focus on the construction of pretty pages, this is a not an advance to be taken lightly.Where it falls short is in the promise of actually teaching the reader how to architect a web-based system for high performance and scalable operation. Like most Web books, it focuses on the user interface aspects of the system, and relegates the much more difficult server and network architecture portions to a minor feature of the book."
1,Worked good for three months.,Worked well until the blower motor went out. It now gets hot when plugged in but will not spin. This product work well until it broke. now to get it replaced I must pay to have it packed and shipped back. Then they say they will test and if bad replace with me paying shipping. Just doesnt seem fair. I do not have the time to wait for testing so I am going to buy a different brand. maybe from a company that will send me a new product until they are able to verify what I a saying is true.
4,Harsh and Human.,"Richardson crafts a skillful read of his journey from a Little People of America convention through a year of continued association with several of the people he meets. As he explicitly states, Richardson isn't out to show holy triumph over physical limitations, but rather presents his subjects and self in all of their imperfect, neurotic glory. The conventional-sized mother of a dwarf needing expensive and painful surgery becomes consumed by her daughter's needs and develops an internet obsession as her family fractures. Richardson honestly grapples with his physical discomfort regarding dwarfism. Strangest of all is his description of the borderline stalker relationship with ""Andrea"", his unrelenting and militantly-opinionated correspondent. Tall or small, they're all a bundle of nerves and it's a fascinating read. Drags a bit in places, with tiresome but necessary repetitious descriptions of e-mail correspondence, but well worth checking out."
2,Not good,"Had made my own out of cardboard before buying this. Trust me, the cardboard worked much better. This stuff is OK if you don't have, or can't make, anything else but it only partially seals. The material is too stiff and it's very wavy/wrinkly. Doesn't seal all that well. It's better than nothing if it's all you can find but my cardboard version was better."
4,Good,"Product as described, but I needed to use more nails than instructions said for the seal to fit tight. There were enough nails, but I didn't need to use all of the seal. It should help in the cold weather as I had alot of space between the door & door jam. I'd buy again."
5,Keep The Hope Alive,"I read this book back in November of 2006 and was fascinated from the first page. What could be more exciting than to be hot on the trail of something that the experts say no longer exists, armed with information that says it still does.I'm reminded of the book ""The Lost Grizzlies"" by Rick Bass about the search to discover grizzly bears living in southern Colorado where they have been supposedly non-existent for years. A tuft of hair, a pile of scat but no pictures and no video.I find the possibility of finding the Ivory Bill even more exciting than the search itself. Here's to the dreamers and hopefuls who keep the hunt alive. Whether searching for Ivory Bills in Arkansas, grizzlies in Colorado or bigfoot in the Bitteroot I applaud those undeterred spirits who fuel the fire of the search and help fill our shelves with stories of adventure and hope."
4,Learning Language Arts Through Literature-Tan book,"This book is easy to use and has the daily, step by step instructions needed to teach your 6th grader Language Art skills. The daily lessons are not time consuming but may not have enough practice if you have a slower student or one that does better with more practice. At the end of each week there are review activities if additional practice is needed which may be all that is needed for some.It is very easy to implament. The daily lessons are not time consuming but the answers are on the same page as the instructions so I recommend getting the student book as well."
4,Seems to be great quality and action,"This was on my son's Christmas list, so I bought it for him. He seems to be well pleased with the action and quality. He plays well with it."
1,How babies are made,I bought it for grandchildren but my son will not use it. He feels it is too grafity for five and seven year olds.
1,LEAVE IT TO UNIVERSAL TO RIP US OFF AGAIN!,"Just when you thought Universal couldn't get any lower, they pull this one:In 2001, Universal/MCA released the excellent, FIFTY-TWO track""All The Leaves Are Brown: The Golden Era Collection"", which contained the best-audio, complete M&P; four album collection (with extras!).So what did Universal do? They pulled ""Era"" off the market, took the same audio master, whacked out a third of the material and substituted this THIRTY-THREE track release in its place.There are still used copies of ""Era' floating around on this site, eBay & Half. My advice: Track down one of those sets and get the complete M&P; recordings."
2,not the original or the real the mopeds or mopes,"Well, once again proving that fine musicianship does not a great rock band make... these scandinavian mopeds have layed down more slick and clever tracks to the dismay of us crazy real raw rock and roll lovers. Just compare these poppy new wave-ish tracks to the bruteish intelligence of the ""real"" mopeds also known as the mopes. An electric duo from the east coast usa broke up in 1987, blasted crazy punk rotten psychedelic grooves and ironic bombast. You can checkout a new site dedicated to their memory for free mp3's( www.themopes.com ) and compare for yourself. The old dive bar heroes or these newer well meaning popsters?"
5,Morison the Magnificent,"Morrison's run on Xmen is fantastic. He understands and appreciates many of the characters and fleshes out their personalities well. The only character that Morrison might have researched a tad more is Beast. In the first volume, Beast is not nearly the fuzzy blue intellectual brimming with witicisms that we all know and love. Morrison does, however, correct this by the later issues. At first, New Xmen with Morrison is a bit of a slow start, but following the storyline through to the end, you see that it was well worth it. Intricate plot lines are followed through to their logical conclusions if you read the entirety of Morrison's run. A necessary read for lovers of Whedon's ""Astonishing Xmen"", as many of the plot devices referred to there (such as Cassandra Nova; Emma's secondary mutation) start here. Worth reading through to the end."
3,Hmm...,"This was the weakest story arc in Morrison's new X-Men run.It begins with the weakest issue of his entire run, an issue that does not seem at all to be even remotely close to a Grant Morrison comic book.Chris Bachalo's art is the most radically different from any of the other 8 artists on the series. While Igor Kordey's art was not great, it at least fit in with van Sciver, Grant, Jiminez, Quitely, Yu and Leon. Bachalo does not resemble them stylistically.And the story itself is probably the weakest in Morrison's run.That being said, this is still better then most of the non-MOrrison x-books that are for sale."
3,Not a great product,The frog did not fit my faucet. The bag that holds the toys is not big enough and does not stick very well to the wall.
4,Laughing at bedtime!,"This book was laying on a table at my local library when I picked up not knowing what a treasure it was. My daughter enjoys this book and laughs at Momma Chicken as she scares the bear, alligator and tiger out of Lulu's bedroom. Its so funny to see her laugh at these things and I feel it gives her confidence that her Momma will scare all the monsters away too. I am not giving the book 5 stars because the inside front and back cover illustrations do appear a little scary, even though it depicts the same characters inside the book, but my daughter doesn't seem to mind. :)"
4,"A good sequel to ""Rock Swings...""","I cannot understand how so many of the reviewers who posted so far would give low ratings to this new CD.Paul Anka has been in the business of making music for half a century now (since his teenage years), and he knows how to take any song (standard or contemporary) and put his own stamp on it. Most of the songs chosen for this CD are well-suited to the big-band backings crafted by the likes of Patrick Williams, Randy Kerber and John Clayton (Jeremy Lubbock did the string charts on others).Anka doesn't ignore his own rich songwriting legacy here...enlisting the services of fellow Maple Leafer Michael Buble on ""You are My Destiny,"" given a modern swing vibe courtesy of John Clayton's arrangement. And Jon Bon Jovi helps ""My Way"" sound fresh in this day and age...in my opinion, this song brought me to tears, just like Sinatra's version did many years ago.Call this ""Rock Swings, Part 2"" if you wish, but hey folks...the current title says it all!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"This is a cheaply made piece of junk. The materials and craftsmanship are well below average. It just feels cheap. The first problems I encountered were with the water bottles. Sometimes they leak, sometimes they don't work at all. It's just not a good design - very unreliable. Next problem, the motor started making noises after only a few months of continuous operation. Eventually the motor burned up completely after only 5 months of use. Seems like this unit was not designed to be run continuously. If you only plan to use it a few hours a day, it might last you a couple of years. Don't waste your money on anything from Essick Air. They don't build quality products."
1,Bad motor,"I purchased this unit for my daughter. It is very loud and roars on the ""quiet""setting. She is waiting forinstructions from the company in order to send back the defective part for replacement."
2,Women With Attention Deficit Disorder: Embracing Disorganization at Home and in the Workplace (Paperback),"For a busy person with ADD the book was difficult to read. I did scan through the book it seemed to give some good information. For someone without AD/HD it might be readable. I'm sending the book off to my sister, who is highly gifted, and believes she may be ADD. I'll see if she can get through the read."
4,"Great book, but needs a proofreader","This is a wonderful book, full of insight and empathy. As I was reading it, I kept thinking, ""Wow. How did she get inside my head?"" My only problem with it is all the typos. They were a little distracting for me. I hope for the next edition that the publisher hires a professional proofreader before going to print."
2,Too Much Detail,"This book had way too many details and took too long to lead up to the major plot. The back describes an ""explosive moment"", which turns out to be a so-so moment in the last few pages of the book. The entire first 90% of the book is useless details about the characters.I only kept reading to find out what the explosive moment was, only to be disappointed."
3,"Semi-addictive, but not a must-have.","Have you bought every other musical theater CD there is to possibly get? If you have, this is a good one to get. There are some great songs that you can't stop playing over and over....and then there are songs that you can't stand. I liked ""We've Got Time"" a lot...and all of the songs from ""Lavender Girl"", and a lot of the ""The Flight of the Lawnchair Man"" to be good...but I thought ""The Mice"" really was lacking. I like that O'Keefe guy's other CD, ""Bat Boy,"" and if you like the ""The Mice"" portion of this CD, i suggest you get the ""Bat Boy"" CD. Get this CD and try it out...It's worth listening to, but it's not one of those ones that gets stuck in your CD-player...Also, just a little tidbit...The store I bought this CD at was right next door to where this show premiered in Philadelphia...Just in case you wanted to know."
5,He's Done It Again,This is Osborn's best work to date. A fascinating book....and I saw a side of the Vatican I never had experienced before.Great read!
3,Entertaining,"The author makes the best of the characters it creates and touches sensible issues within the Catholic Church. The good thing is that the author does not make political statements but creates a story with numerous interconnected characters. I think the story had a clear plot and it was interesting for the most part, however the resolution is very anticlimactic and it makes the conflict of the whole story not dramatic at all. It is a fun read, but dont expect a thriller or highly political argument."
5,REQUIRED READING,"With a great plot and characters, this book moves fast. It should be required reading for everyone at the Vatican, as well as anyone who thinks the Vatican is a little unreal and doesn't seem to have much in common with ordinary people. I certainly agree with the book's plea for more human popes like John XXIII."
3,Oval bracelet review,"Pretty bracelet but really small. I didn't realize 7.5"" really isn't large enough for an adult."
4,"Easy to set up, works fine so far","I bought this as a second remote for an existing door opener. It took about 2 minutes to ""synchronize"" with the opener. Very simple process. It has been used regularly for about a month, and so far no problems. The worst part will be opening the remote to get the battery replaced...they did not make it very easy to pry open without marring the ""case."""
5,It opens my garage door!,"I accidentally left my old remote control on top of my car while it was raining outside. It died, so I bought this replacement. All I had to do was synch it with my garage door, which consists of pressing a button on the unit in the garage and on the remote. Now, it opens my garage door when I press the button every time!"
5,amazing retelling,"I truthfully could not stand the original series. It was hard to follow and irritating to watch. I basically wanted to kill all the characters, especially Shinji. The anime is truly horrid and really doesn't deserve the praise it got.Eva 2.22 is different. All the characters are LIKEABLE. You can actually somewhat relate, and not have to deal with a certain completely psychotic flat character. The new character, angels, as well as the re-imagined angels just enjoyable and make it a great series.I personally can't wait for Eva 3.33 due to how the story is setup and told. Eva 1.11 and 2.22 are so well done that they are truly memorable for their store, rather then the original anime which was memorable for it being incredibly stupid and confusing."
2,This one got by me,"This is one which seems creatively great, but, I couldn't get with it.Might be my old age."
1,MONAURAL DUB and weirdly not from the center speaker,"I have to talk about the sound of this particular version produced by Funimation.This is the very first time I noticed such atrocious sound recording in my dvd and blu-ray purchasing history.Yes, it is 6.1 True HD, as it showed on the screen of my 7.1 ch amplifier.BUTThe Japanese dub comes ONLY FROM THE LEFT SPEAKER, whilethe English dub comes ONLY FROM THE RIGHT SPEAKER.It really feels sick that you hear all the conversations only from one of your sides....Otherwise, probably thanks to the original Japanese blu-ray production, the sound effect, music and all other sound components are just perfect.I imagine that Funimation is responsible for this most horrible possibly imaginable decision of monaural dubbing.I have not personally checked the Amazon.co.jp version, but it must be that the dubbing is stereo.I strongly recommend you NOT to purchase THIS PARTICULAR VERSION produced by Funimation. They should not look down upon the customers!"
5,A Movie for Eva Fans & Everyone Alike,"Evangelion fans have a very tragic experience following a series that has had its epic highs, and epic lows. Without spoliling the ending, if you're a fan of Eva on any level, it is well worth watching this one through to the end (before and after credits).But, if you're not an Eva fan, Eva 1.11 and 2.22 represent the latest iteration of one of the greatest series of all time. This is the Star Wars of Japan, and truly deserves an equal footing of international recognition. If you haven't watched Eva yet, it's time to start. While watching the TV series (and 1990s movies) is strongly recommended, it's far from essential.The Rebuild of Evangelion was designed for a broader audience, and Eva 2.22 runs with that concept in jaw-dropping excellence. While some scenes are dripping in computer generation, Eva 2.22 stays true to its hand-drawn roots. Stop reading this review, go buy it!"
5,Epic,"Before anyone watches it, I would highly recommend that you watch the original series and the movies that go along with it. This is the second part of the rebuild series that are based in an alternate timeline, so those new the Evangelion series it would seem very rushed.This part of the series seems to start off a little slow, but you shouldn't worry cause it takes off flying once it reaches a certain part of movie. I greatly enjoyed it and would recommend it to any fan of the Evangelion series."
5,Great DVD,"My wife and I use this DVD often and we rave to our friends about the workouts, we look forward our daily workouts with this product."
5,Great Beginner Workout,"I don't know what else I can offer that the other (at this time) 130+ reviewers have already mentioned. Although I've moved on to more ""advanced"" workouts like P90X, I still put this disc in the player from time to time when I'm exhausted after work, but I need to maintain the routine of working out. Nice, straight forward workout, especially if you're using a weighted vest for added resistance. Leslie speaks constantly throughout the entire thing, so you're never bored. I used this when I first started (and was terribly out of shape) -- it's a nice bridge for those who are new to exercise that want to try more aerobic workouts, but need to build up the endurance necessary to complete them."
5,Heart pumping workout esp good for bad knees,"I decided to try Leslie's ""Walk at Home"" dvds after developing knee problems. I'm 38 and moderately overweight. I have previously been a gym rat and was doubtful that I could get in shape (again) by ""only"" walking at home, but I was very pleasantly surprised! The walking speed is fast and the workout is high energy throughout. I can do the entire workout at high intensisty without my knees holding me back, whereas taebo and the biggest loser cardio workout were too much - I had to skip too many steps bc of my knees.I have grown a library of Leslie's Walk at Home dvds and trade them out to avoid boredom. I like Leslie's sunny disposition and encouragement and the miles go by quickly. I highly recommend her dvds for beginner and returning exercisers. They are a good, heart pumping and sweat inducing cardio workout that can be done at home. I add some strength moves and situps afterward to roundout my routine."
3,Not what expected,"I'm a fairly experienced wood worker and wanted to get into some ""Rustic Furniture"" building, I've seen many pieces locally and thought I'd give it a try. What I was expecting was furniture built with tenon joints that would look nice in any home. What the book is, are a bunch of plans to build very very very rustic looking furniture. What I mean by rustic is raw unpeeled log/sticks unlike anything I've ever seen. This is not the rustic type furniture you would see in a lodge or expect to see in a log cabin, if that's what you're expecting, which I was this book is not for you."
2,Poor description of content.,Did not contain the information I believed it would. Better description of the contents would improve it. Do not believe it should be grouped with the tenon cutter. Very little information in the book pertained to log furniture.
4,Very Funny Book,"Even though the category is ""Gay & Lesbian"", these plays do not fit the category all that well...so if you are looking for gay or lesbian plays, this probably isn't the book for you. If you are looking for funny plays, this is the book for you. All of the plays in this book are good, though some can get a wee bit boring at parts. I especially like TALE OF THE ALLERGIST'S WIFE and PSYCHO BEACH PARTY, though all of them are great."
2,May overlook the power of God,"One omission in ""Divided by Faith"" troubled me -- it did not seem to leave room for the work of God, a concept crucial to evangelicals, no matter the hue of their beauty.Our cross-culture ""Bridging the Racial Divide"" group spent two months trying to discuss ""Divided by Faith."" The rock on which we continued to crash was its apparent hopelessness that a multi-ethnic church can prosper and grow long-term.We believe God commands us to unity (JN 10:16 & 17:21), and has the power to fulfill those commands. Our group is now studying Clarence Shuler's ""Winning the Race to Unity."" Without minimizing the difficulties noted by ""Divided by Faith"", Shuler manages to retain hope, which makes all the difference (MT 19:24-26.)"
5,Chamberlain 956CB Multi-function 3-Button Remote Control,"I have found this product to be extremely easy to program. It works perfectly, and keeping it on the keyring instead of in sight clipped to the sun visor discourages theft. I am very very satisfied with this product."
3,Great Idea but has a problem,"Unit worked great and improves security over a button left in the car that could be stolen.One big problem however, is the door can open without you knowing if you carry the unit in your pant pocket, or even handling the unit laying it down on the dresser etc. it needs a delay time of a second on pushing the button so just bumping the button in your pocket etc. doesn't open the door without you realizing it."
5,Great service,"Needed another remote for our opener. They were fast, helpful, and knew their stuff... I'm keeping them in my contacts!"
1,Bad range of the system,"Bought a replacement Transmitter and receiver system from AAA remotes, CA . Problem was the Liftmaste 9* serie transmitters is that they work on 390 MHz and that frequency is currently jammed by the military and the range of the transmitter gets very small that you have to touch the door before it recognizes the signal. AAA remotes is aware of this and keeps on advertising the 9* series as an good replacement system and does not put any disclaimers near the 9* serie products. AAA remotes did not want to replace/exchange for the 315 Mhz models. They really horrible at their customer service and this policy. I definetly recommend never buy from this organization."
3,Nighttime view,"Gauges were easy to install. I did not use mounting bracket, installed directly into dash. Work well, but hard to see white needle at night. Would be easer to see red or orange needle."
2,Do not use with small caliber hose,I bought this along with a coiled 75 foot hose...and it did not work very well...not enough pressure so it just runs out of the wand and not spray like rain. Have not tried it with a regular hose
1,"Nice book, too bad Amazon's stock is all damaged...","While the book is great, I have received no less than 3 damaged versions of this book from Amazon. Clearly their entire stock is messed up as each replacement they have sent has the same problems. Namely, sticking pages where glue leaked from the spine during binding, scuffed and soiled covers, and heavy dings or crushed spines. Order from someone else!"
5,Cotton Pickin' Blues,"Tommy McClennan and Robert Petway, rough-voiced singer-guitarists with similar styles, were part of the last wave of down-home blues guitarists to record for the major labels in Chicago. McClennan was the more prolific of the two. Indeed, he contributed several standards to the blues repertoire, including ""Bottle it Up and Go,"" ""Whiskey Headed Woman"" and ""Crosscut Saw"" (later covered by Albert King), all included here. Petway's recorded legacy includes ""Boogie Woogie Woman"" and ""Rockin' Chair Blues."" Neither was an accomplished guitarist but made up for their limitations with boisterous panache. This is good-time blues played and sung with a lot of enthusiasm."
2,"Looks great, awkward to adjust","Although this product looks beautiful in the shower, and works well, it is awkward to adjust the water temperature. The cap of the handle has to come off and then there are screws to turn, etc. My contractor complained a lot. At the first adjustment, the water was barely warm enough to get in. He had to turn the water all the way to hot to make our shower useable. We do keep our water heat low to save on bills. Still, our contractor really hated it."
5,Mary & Max,I'd seen this movie before I ordered it and loved it.I bought 3 copies (2 for friends) so that probably gives you a good indication of how good I think this film is!It's brilliantly made and is funny and emotional. Easily as good if not better than Wallace & Grommit.
5,A must read,"Explained so much, why we say and do the things we do, and how to start the road to recovery."
2,May not work for everyone,"This book is an invaluable aid to those who feel forgiveness is their best way to find healing, or for those whose personal beliefs demand this, but it's too simplistic to work for every trauma victim. Some victims find the pressure to forgive their tormentors to be an additional burden, or an addition to their pain, or an insult to their suffering. Therapy must be tailored to the individual and this method just doesn't work for everyone."
4,great fim,"Great fun putting it all together and such.. Postage was slow but want do you expect when you go cheap, lol"
3,Push button ease!,"My orginal motion detection panel crapped out on me both ways so, I ordered this as a replacement. Mine worked for a few months and now the motion detection part is out again (can't see) but still opens garage fine."
5,dog loves the thermo-bed,"jade loves laying around on the pad. whenever we are upstair she lays on the pad, it seems to take the stiffnes out of her hips. thanks"
5,YUMMMMM,"This is the second time now that I'm ordering a case of these gummies! I love these, the flavors are very good and if you like some tartness to your candy, then these are perfect. These are also soft to chew so you don't feel like your teeth are going to crack when biting down on them. When the case I'm working on now is gone, I will order another one! Enjoy!"
3,You love it or hate it,"To be frank, if you don't like romance, you probably won't enjoy this book, despite it's science fiction overtones. Fans of the movie know what to expect from the typical Japanese horror, however, for the open minded: a good read."
2,Songs may be Don Williams but he is not the only singer of songs,"I just received this CD in the mail.I like the songs on the CD Title Where do we go from HERE?But when it was down loaded to my computer the title comes up""Spend some time with ME"" I know that the songs may be DonWilliams but they are not sung by him. A very few areYou misrepresented this CD. Not happy about thatThank you"
2,Very small and not enough information!!!!,"I was looking for a book that contain lots information about bags. I thought this would be the one, but it wasn't !! It has a couple of interesting quotes and some good information in the first 10 pages but thats it! On top of that it is very small which I wouldn't have minded if it would have contained more historical information. Although the pictures are pretty good and it has a couple of rare purses. I decided to keep it for my fashion archives."
5,Positive Vibration,"5 Stars is not enough for this one. 4 live tracks and 34 incredible tracks for the price of a regular CD. What's not to like? Digitally remastered in its full glory, Gold is...well..pretty much all of the revered hits(e.g. No Woman No Cry) as well as some lesser known, yet just as archetypal efforts such as Crazy Baldhead. The more intense Marley fans might scoff at this 2 CD set as too commercially appealing.I, on the other hand, think this is perfect for any Marley enthusiast who doesn't feel like buying 20 separate CD's but wants to experience Marley from his austere beginning to his untimely death. The ingenious layout of Gold delineates its tracks like Stir It Up from his first independent album all the way to Buffalo Soldier and Iron Lion Zion that were, of course, released posthumously. Solid."
4,I actually liked it,"Clearly, I'm in the minority when I say that I enjoyed this book. Yes, it was incredibly improbable that any of these things happened, but hey, I read a book to escape from my boring, realistic life.Although I will say that I found Kate increasingly annoying as a so called ""therapist."" I only have a Bachelors in Psychology, but come on, half of her decisions and thought processes are not realistic in someone who is highly educated in psychology and family therapy.But anyway, I found it a real page turner, simply for the entertainment aspect."
2,Love and the serial killer.,"The premise for this book is so absurd I can hardly believe there was a story to go with it. After reading Fielding's 5 star GRAND AVENUE, I wanted to read everything she has written.Kate's sister JoLynn opens the paper one morning and decides she will fall in love and marry the serial killer who's handsome picture is plastered all over the front page. His trial is moving along and JoLynn decides to meet with him to give him her support.The rest is totally absurd with little merit. I find it hard to believe the same author wrote both of these books. The one redeeming aspect is that this author excels at creating living, breathing, characters, even the ones that behave in the most unbelievable manner. Kelsana 4/23/02"
4,Synopsis,"Missing Pieces is Joy Fielding's most perfect accomplishment so far. Every bit of narrative and dialogue is skillfully crafted--nothing brings the reader up short. The narrator has a true voice, one with which woman can easily empathize. All the charactres are believable. Even though the author carefully plants the appropriate clues, the ending still comes as a surprise. M.B. McArdle"
4,"Once again, Joy Fielding did not disappoint","Having read several of Fielding's previous books, I was anticipating a thoughtful and mesmerizing novel - I was not disappointed! I found ""Missing Pieces"" hard to put down and entertaining throughout. I liked her style of closely examining Kate and her family members while keeping up the suspense. Perhaps I could relate to this novel because I am similarly situated to Kate, with a teenage daughter. Although I thought she made some poor choices in overlooking or ignoring her family members' behavior, I found this totally believable. It is hard to see what you don't want to be present in family members."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"My very first book of Joy Fielding and I truly loved it. Her characters were very real, very human. Contrary to another review, I did not find Kate Sinclair stupid, she was guilty of something human beings are guilty of doing, not wanting to see the reality of her family's faults. The fact that Kate knew and did not admit it to herself just made her more human, being a therapist does not mean that one does not have their own personal demons to deal with. This book was not only a suspense novel but it was also about real human beings dealing with real family relationships."
2,Keep Looking!,"I ended up purchasing two of these. The regular profile one did not seem to fit correctly, so I purchased the Low Profile as well. I am not please with either. They are bulky in your mouth, and do not stay in all night! I often find mine on the pillow in the morning. I will keep looking until I find something better!"
2,"Good idea, not so good design (for me anyway)","This was my first dental guard. It is adjustable. Although it took me a while to find the best setting. It felt very uncomfortable in the beginning but I kept trying to get used to it. I could feel that my jaws were being trained to relax. I also liked the material it is made of. However, there is either something wrong with its design or I should have tried a different model. The biggest issue was that the side wings were rubbing my gums around the gap between the two parts of the side wings. I had to stop using the guards for a few days, treat my gums with a gel that's usually used by people who wear dentures to heal gums. I kept trying a few times until my husband decided to fix it with boiling water and spoiled it completely. Regardless, I wouldn't be using it anyway. One of the reviewers for this product had mentioned same problem that I have had. I think it does not suit people with sensitive gums and, possibly, smaller jaw(?) size."
2,Scrapes my Cheeks,"The outer sides of the device contain the adjustment slider for the bite pad. It has relatively rough edges. I wake up with an irritated swollen spot inside each cheek where those edges rubbed against me. Other than that issue the product works great. It stays in place for me well. I don't have a grinding problem but a clenching and chomping problem, so that might be the difference. I will try it one more night. This will be the third. Then I will try to get a refund if it continues. I'm not optimistic. My cheek is already feeling the leftover soreness from just putting it in."
1,Ouch,Even though I read the reviews that this was bulky i decided to try it anyways. Within two days my TMD was worse. I recommend the dentek one you mold in your mouth. I have tried four and this one works the best.
1,Dont waste your money,This is junk; does not fit in your mouth or does what it claims to do.It is hard and bulky. It is definately a waste of money.
2,Under-impressed,"I thought this would help with my nighttime grinding of my teeth, but it just isn't comfortable and I really regret spending the money on it.Guess it is cheaper than getting one from the dentist, but I still don't think it was worth the price."
3,Not for me,"I got this mouth guard after my dentist told me I grind my teeth and suggested I get one to prevent further damage. I liked the fact that it didn't have to be boiled and had the bite pads. However, I have a narrow mouth and the guard fits awkwardly. I can barely talk and on more that one night it has kept me from getting to sleep. The guard has also caused my gums to bleed and some of my teeth to shift. All my issues come down to the fit really so if you can find one that's the right size this can be a really good mouth guard."
2,Buy the Secure-Comfort or Dura-Comfort version instead,"Tried this night guard and it kept falling out in the night. Finally woke up one day and it was broken in two (where the adjustable bite pads attach to the guard is the weakest spot). This guard doesn't stay in place well enough for a side sleeper to use. Maybe if you sleep on your back or stomach it would work. I am using the Sleep Right Secure-Comfort now and am having better luck, the extra wings that it has helps to keep the guard from falling out or moving around in the night. These are very comfortable night guards, much better than the boil type in my opinion. Couldn't get to sleep with the boil types, they are too bulky and uncomfortable.Keep your receipt if you buy any of the Sleep Right products - there is a 3 month warranty (6 month on the Dura-Comfort version)."
2,Comfortable fit but it caused my teeth to shift,"I bought this night guard to use while I was saving to have my dentist create a new replacement custom guard for me. This product is pretty good for the price. I found it much more comfortable than the ones that must be boiled. It stayed in place as I slept. It's easy to clean. It prevented my teeth from grinding against each other. Overall, I was initially very happy with it.Unfortunately, I had to discontinue use after less than a month due to the uneven pressure from the bite guards causing the teeth directly in front of the bite guards to shift. I would wake with sore teeth and a bite that wouldn't correctly align. Generally by the end of the day my bite would seem to work itself back into place, but I worried about long term effects so I stopped using it."
2,Not so impressed,"I had spent several hundreds of dollars on a dentist-made guard but was never happy with the fit. So, I decided to try one of the other options out there. I was drawn to this product because I have a smaller mouth and thought it would be perfect for me. It turns out that it wasn't quite what I thought it would be. It held my mouth open at an awkward angle, so my jaw ended up being more sore in the morning than without it. Also, the strap ended up bothering my gums. While I think the concept of this product was great, it still needs to be tweaked before I will buy it again.I ended up finding one that fit better: Dr. Brux. It's a lot more expensive (runs $49.99 - $69.99) but I am extremely happy with it. It seems like it would be more bulky, but I find it is more comfortable than any other night guard I have tried."
1,not comfortable!,Not comfortable at all! my man wouldn't wear it ! Still sleepless :-( but we did find a doctors one at walmart
1,Awful,"I purchased this product in hopes that it would hold me over until I had to purchase a dental mouth guard from my dentist.I wore the Sleep Right Mouth Guard for to nights and could not do it any longer.I intentionally bought the 'Slim Comfort' Guard as I do have a small jaw.Unfortunately the headaches caused from wearing the guard were worse than grinding my teeth at night.I stopped wearing the guard and immediately threw it away.I do not recommend this product, pay the extra money and get a mouth guard from your dentist.Two thumbs down."
1,Don't waste your $,Uncomfortable. Choose their cheaper model instead. I ended up throwing this one out and switching back to the old one.
2,yucky,"After reading all of the positive reviews for this product I was really looking forward to being able to purchase an affordable device for teeth-grinding, as the price quote from the dentist alarmed me!However, upon receiving this, and trying it out, I found it impossible to use without gagging-sorry to be graphic.The product description says that there is a 30 day money back guarantee, thank goodness, so I emailed seller BUT got a very curt reply, via blackberry no less, that I needed to contact the company that makes this on order to return item, and get a refund from them, NOT the seller. At least the curt reply gave an email address to contact. I found this annoying and time consuming, and probably will not buy from this seller again, Dental USA."
5,Loved Lengthen Your Stride,"I loved this book. The price was high, but worth it. I saw a detailed intimate view of the Kimball presidency, and felt that I really got to know this great leader. The Kindle version leaves somewhat to be desired as it splits up sidebars and footnotes, thus making the story line hard to read. I persisted though, and felt that this book strenghened by understanding and testimony."
4,Buffy's not the only gorgeous blonde in Sunnydale.,Bears a striking resemblance to actress Julie Benz who portrays Darla in both Buffy and Angel.
1,Bloody Thing Leaked,"Try a Kodak or Fuji disposable underwater camera.I particularly like the Fuji. They don't have flashes, so everything looks blue in the pictures, but at least they don't leak."
1,I wish I had read the other reviews first...,"Bought 2 of these in the airport as I left for holiday (because they had a flash which the Kodak ones did not, and advertised themselves to a greater depth). Now reading the other reviews I suspect they have a manufacturing default which renders them useless. Neither camera could advance the film properly, so that I only got 5 and 8 shots out of the two of them. It looks like you are taking the pictures as it advances the numbers on the top, but in reality you only end up shooting shot after shot over the same piece of film. My cases were water proof, but the film cartridge looks like it leaks light, as the un used film was still streaked. It's sad as we had some great shark and turtle dives. DON'T BUY THESE - get the cheaper Kodak at this end of the market!"
2,not so great...,"This product sounds promising. It's adequate if your bag is held to the side (hanging straight down); but if you wear your bag cross torso (messenger), it just plain does not work."
2,not so great,"Binoculars work great, but not camera. I recently bought this for a sporting event which was indoors and pictures were mostly too dark to see anything, unfortunately I must say outdoor pics were not that great either. Pics need to be taken with plenty of light and steady hands (in which case pics are okay but not for price paid). The software was pretty good (very minor glitches). The screen displays are easy to read and follow. I really liked the idea, but there needs to be more improvement."
2,Not as good as their first album,"I just read all the reviews for this album and I must admit that I am really surprised to see that almost everyone liked this album as much as the first one. In my humble opinion, there is just no comparison. Apart from three or four boring songs in the first one, all the others are real gems. The songs are great musically, some of them make me laugh histerically, and some of them make me want to jump and scream (""Puto""). I expected to find more of the same in their second album, but unfortunately I haven't been able to find it after repeated listens... :-(The songs in this album just don't grab me musically or lyrically. In my case, I will be playing the first album for years to come, while I will let this one collect dust."
3,Fun play but very annoying disc requirement,"Overall very enjoyable casino play with fun extras like tournaments and prize boards. Great quick help and advice per hand on many card games. Slots least enjoyable (poor, too busy graphics on many, no win sounds). REASON FOR DOWNGRADE is REQUIREMENT to put cd in drive in order to play - very annoying and several times has given error message so have to re-input cd. Also little slow to load at first, and when go to prize boards. Other than those problems, though, overall one of better casino games."
1,Control Plate,This was a waste of money. Not at all what I expected and is very combersome. still sits in the closet unused and unopen
3,succint and good for a newbie,"For a newbie - this is an ideal book.Good to get you jumpstarted and the checklists are useful too!though,could have used more detail in portions.. good effort - waiting for a next version!!"
3,Unbelievably Well Made!,I recently purchased the Tail Gator set and I never imagined a BBQ set could be so well made. The handles are real solid wood and the blades are stainless and clean up in a second. A friend of mine bought an imported set and they could not hold a candle to mine. The blades were flimsy and it had a cheap feel. My Tailgator set weighs almost twice what the import does. Overall I rate this set tops. The nylon case is also great because I can store all the utensils together and stuff them in a drawer. The nylon is real heavy as well. I think this set will make a great gift.
5,Marketing is King,"Ali Pervez has produced a precise and easy to read tutorial on the value of marketing for everyone. We all find ourselves using the very concepts that he presents with real world examples. This positive and motivating book was fun to read, and re-read. I highly recommend it for a broad audience - it is certain to make a difference."
1,Old School Thinking,"I realy hate to say this, but this book was not worth the purchase price. The authors are not up to speed with today's concepts and technology. They hate assessment in any form. They don't get the difference between testing and assessment. There is no recognition of social media or similar.The popularity of this book is riding on the coatails of Bolles, but honestly it makes me question his other books.I was hoping to recommend this book to my students, but no way, no how."
3,handbook,i ordered the book for a class. we never used it. i still have it because i think it has valuable information
5,did the trick... fast service,I placed a new hard drive into this new hard drive caddy and set my laptop virtual memory (swap file) to write to it. WOW!! What a difference in speed! No need in upgrading to a new laptop to get that extra speed boost. Just get an extra drive and caddy like this and upgrade your RAM if you can.This product works perfectly and arrived quickly. I recommend it.
2,shipping disaster,the product is fine. the problem is I attempted to order 3 3 packs and only 1 available. my daughter ad to have these for a trip and none were locally available- result = shipping cost far exceeded cost of product.
4,Great but can't use with reservoir or vent,"I love these lids. The only drawback is that you can't use them with your reservoir or vent in the bottle. So you have to carry the bottle insides, cap, and nipple separately."
5,Glass baby bottle travel caps,They work just fine; no leaks!Would recommend to anyone wanting to carry the bottles without worrying about leakage.Thanks!
4,Item as described,It took a little bit longer than I thought it would to arrive but they were as expected when they were received
3,It's a movie.,"I'm super excited that there are more choices when it comes to queer movies. That being said, this is just another queer movie. But keep up the good work and continue to make movies."
1,An item to avoid,"The Meade CaptureView has two features that should annoy most of us. First of all, it is powered by two AA batteries, but claims to be unable to prevent the batteries from discharging and harming the device if the batteries are left in while the device is off.Secondly, its USB interface is apparently a version of the USB mass storage standard altered to prevent it from working with anything but Microsoft operating systems. For a company one often associates with scientific interests, active discrimination against users of Mac and unix seems unwarranted."
5,one of the best books i have read,"when my friend suggested this book to me i was rather un-enthusiastic to step out of my comfort zone of authors....boy am i glad i did!! this book took me along with birle and orien...i was right there feeling all the hapiness, pain, laughter, romance and sadness. an excellent,excellent book which made me laugh and cry...cynthia voigt, i congratulate u on such a wonderful work I LOVED IT!!"
4,Purr..,"Prance is probably the cutest of the old floppy-bodied Ty cats. He is likable with his gray stripes and bright blue eyes. Mine has messy fur from years of play, and will always be a favorite of mine. I recommend him to collecters, though I can't guarentee that young children would prefer him over a newer Ty cat."
1,Austen just doesn't get the X-Men,"This was just about when I realized I just couldn't justify blowing money every month on ""Uncanny X-Men"" anymore. Chuck Austen, although he has shown some talent on books like ""Superman: Metropolis,"" is totally wrong for this series. Iceman and Polaris are written entirely out of character, Havok's relationship with ""Nurse Annie,"" which bordered on the necrophilic to begin with, just went into plain goofy at this point, and Austen went to great lengths to essentially cut out the heart of Nightcrawler, one of the few characters in comics to devoutly express any religious faith whatsoever. This isn't an X-Men I want to read, and I'm gone as long as Austen is around. Thank Heavens we still have Grant Morrison writing ""New X-Men""... for now."
4,SUPERB APPENDICES!,"The apendices are the better part of this book. It contains all the kills, missing and killed pilots, commander,e tc. I only missed the exact number of missions flown by each pilot, it could have it also. Very easy reading, the black & white photos are amazing."
5,Lots of useful info,"I bought this book used and recommend it highly for those with a Maxxum 7d. It will help to uncover a lot of the very advanced features of the 7d, which I consider a camera way ahead of its time."
5,Supreme ear candy,"Ok, ok, this is almost a duplicate from her 2000 best of, right down to the cover photos... except this time the picture that was on the front is now on back and vice versa...This time around we get 18 songs, no ""megamixes"" (filler, like last time). The songs added on this go 'round are ""Will You Marry Me"" (why yes, Paula, I will), ""One or the Other"", and ""Ain't never Gonna Give You Up"".Right from the get go, these songs leap out of the speakers and are just in your face. The production is busy, lots of things to pick out and latch onto with each listen, but the important thing is you can dance to it.And then there's Paula her self... Ah. The greatest voice in the world? No, but perfect for these songs. What she lacks in technique, she makes up for in spunk, very infectious.These songs are as catchy as a cold. Even if you can't stand her, I bet you know at least a dozen of these sonic bon-bons.She is Paula! She will not be denied!!!!"
4,Great oven mitt,"I picked this up a while ago at CVS in the discount bin... I think it was $0.99 plus tax.Anyway, I love cows, and this was cheap, so it was an impulse buy. I use to to get things out of the oven, upwards of 450 degrees hot, and it works, though I do feel my hands getting rather toasty inside.Not much else I can say about an oven mitt..."
2,Garbage,This Product is only good for after market alarm systems. I tried to use it for my factory alarm system and it will not work. Just blinks blue really dim.
5,"Excellent, truly valuable biography","I enjoyed enormously this book: it doesnt try to sell a myth or an epic and doesnt ""side"" with Deng. The author is a former diplomat and an ""old china hand"" and the reader can fully benefit from a deep, thoughtful and unemotional analysis by an insider.The book is factual, doesnt try to prove any theory and gives you also an excellent overview of the whole Chinese history in this century. I particularly enjoyed the shrewd analysis of all the characters and of their motivations, as you would expect it from the eyes of a professional diplomat gauging his counterparts."
4,"a senior joke book, my folks will be hearing from this for a long time to come","a joke book, on getting old, instead of old jokes themselves. some are good jokes some are just ok. but it is a nice book to read. so far my mom likes some of these jokes...the one about not being ready to see the future even if i could get out of this chair is ok with me. i haven't read it all yet, but i am reading it. my all time favorite joke book is Milton Berle's Private Joke File. it is all full of one-two jokes, with real quick punchlines. i loved it. so i have a lot of joke books now, looking for that great laugh again. don't take life too seriously you won't get out of it alive."
2,"get it right, amazon!","Obviously, the description amazon gives of this movie is the wrong movie description. This is an historical drama about the Roman emperor Nero. It suffers from not knowing whether Nero was a bad guy or a good guy gone astray and spends most of its time developing a silly romance that comes entirely from the not very fertile imagination of the writers and none at all from history. Production values are generally high with some good acting at times, but the script is plain silly. I wrote another review of this for amazon that they never posted, so I won't go into all the details of why it is silly again. Suffice it to say the writers would have been better to follow the historical facts and forget trying to use their imaginations."
2,Mr. Nero's Neighborhood...,"Just for the record, this film, like it's predecessors Julius Caesar and Augustus, was well done, well thought, and entertaining to watch(which is why I didn't leave this one with only one star). However, I could rate it no higher than 2 stars because of how altered and almost sanctified the portrayal of Nero's life and reign actually were. I mean, from what I've always read...he was always nuts, not only persecuted Christians but declared himself the enemy of God, etc. Here, we're forced to believe that he was some sort of victim and succombed to the pressure of bad choices only to be ""redeemed"" in the end. Entertaining...yet a highly inaccurate portrayal of a tyrant and one of the 1st century church's most bloodthirsty persecutors. So if you're a historical buff...you may want to pass this one up."
4,An important if difficult work,"This is a complete study of all the poems attributed to the bard, Taliesin, and reveals the depth and wisdom of the poetry. It is well researched and meticulously translated and stands next to Fire in the Head by Tom Cowan as being important for modern practitioners of Celtic Shamanism. It is, however, a circuitous and difficult read, as all the Matthews works tend to be, and requires the reader to ""stick to it"" to work your way through."
2,Movin' Too Fast,"When I was working on this film its working title was ""Lost In Plainview"", it might be nice if that title was also identified with it. I'm sure that cast members would appreciate it.The film has a lot of action and keeps you guessing throughout. The acting was good and the storyline was interesting."
3,Time consuming,"Like in other reviews I have also found that a yellow gunck builds up on this piece. I do love the Dr Brown bottles and noticed a difference in my baby right away when I began to use these bottles, however there is alot of pieces to clean and on this particular piece I also have to use a q-tip to clean it about every other time I wash it to clean all this yellow build up off."
2,"Grows mold, yuck!","We totally bought into the whole Dr. Brown's thing for my daughter. We have been using them since she was bout 2 months, and she's now 15 months. For our next baby, though, I plan to use Advent or anther brand. This part in particular grows mold, so I have had to buy them over and over again. There's a little dimple type thing in the middle that you can't clean under, and it becomes gross. If you only have a few bottles, and wash them right away, you're probably fine. However, my husband and I both work, so we have 9 bottles, and wait until they are all dirty to run the dishwasher. I didn't realize it was mold at first, and was so horrified with myself once I realized it."
4,inserts,It is great that I can buy parts and supplies separately. My original ones turned yellowith after 6 months of use
5,Great introduction to the subjects!,"This book is a rarity in mathematics - a technical book on a difficult subject that remains entirely readable, even to non-specialists. Rather than the usual 300 pages of dense text and inscrutable proofs, the author gives examples, straightforward proofs, and a writing style that borders on the (gasp!) conversational. Highly recommended, especially for non-mathematicians needing to learn K-theory. :)"
1,"Wrap This ""Rapper"" and Trash It","This is a real car wreck of a movie and its easy to see why it never got a theatrical release. The Director deserves most of the blame, but there's plenty to go around. The only copies of this film likely to sell will be to people who worked on it, trying to get every copy off the market so they can sponge the stain off their resumes."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"I haven't found a Sulky product yet that didn't do what it was supposed to. My only warning for this product is to keep in mind that this is a heavier weight stabilizer than what you may need. When I'm embroiderying something light-weight, I use Sulky's Solvy Water Soluble Stabilizer and spray it with 505 Spray and Fix. When I'm embroiderying something medium-weight, I use a medium-weight stabilizer and spray it with the 505. The advantage of the Sulky Sticky Self-Adhesive is that is provides a stronger hold on the fabric than what you may get with a spray fabric adhesive. P.S. With the Self-Adhesive, my needle got ""gunked up"" and I needed to clean my needle more often than I do with the spray on."
1,Don't bother.,"The side effects are absolutely unbearable. I only took one serving of it, and the caffine has made me so jittery and anxious. I can't stop shaking and i've got an absolutely terrible headache. There are bad reviews all over the place on this product, claims that the caffine is too high, there's no significant appetite suppressant, and worst of all, no significant weight loss, even in those who have used it for over 6 months! In my opinion, worst excuse for a ""natural"" weight loss supplement out there. Save your money for health food or a gym membership, it would be much more worth it."
5,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!","This was one of the absolute best books I've read in a long time. It provided me with the relationship fiction I love reading while at the same time tackling some serious issues. I felt myself crying, rooting for and cursing out the main character, Aja. Ms. Billingsley is a vivid writer who had me engrossed in her lyrical storytelling abilities. I look forward to reading more books from this writer! Definitely go get get this book!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"This ""book"" is more like a booklet. The lettering styles are either repeating ones I've already seen or so elementary, I wouldn't use them. This book was really disappointing, coming from such an experienced author."
5,PERFORMS AS EXPECTED,"We had a similar item on one of our wedding registries and it was still outstanding afterward. I had also read several unfavorable reviews in regard to that item, many of which stemmed form it having plastic parts.I had previously seen the Oster at Costco during one of my many visits so I purchased this for my husband who loves to make milk shakes and HE LOVES IT and has had no problem with it and its ability to make a shake to his liking. I also was able to get it at COSTCO for $19.99 which is significantly lower than the prices I've seen advertised."
5,Terrific Book - No Excuses!,"I guess I'm somewhat taken aback by some of the reviewers who apparently read the book to their children, or got partway through it, without having looked it over themselves first. Sorry, that's just irresponsible. The book is a fabulous treatment of a terrible subject that your children ARE aware of, and this helps explain how ordinary people became heroes that awful day.My 6-year old first fell in love with this book when he was 4, and he knows enough about 9/11 to know it was a horrible event. His dad (me) was next door to the WTC that morning, so he and his brother lived through waiting to hear from me with his mom.The book is sensitive and touching. It's a great book and I highly recommend it. If you think your child might have a problem with ANY book, you should always read it yourself first."
3,Thanks for making me cry me head off in front of my child !!,"The publisher of this book should have added a few more words to the title of this book - "" A book about Sept.11"". I had no idea that Fireboat was about this horrible tragedy. In no way was I prepared to encounter this subject unexpectedly and I soon was sobbingly trying to get through the rest of the book.It seemed like a light and breezy book at first, then a slap in the face a page later.I don't think this is a badly written or illustrated book, but people should be prepared to deal with our their own emotions before reading it.I got this book from the library - I should have read the Amazon reviews first !"
1,Worst customer service ever!!! Don't Buy this,"I am surprised this product is still on SALE!!!!The manufacture said it was a DISCONTINUED item.It was my Christmas gift from my husband and exactly one month later broken. (120 lbs of girl, workout-45min, 5 days per week).Even with warranty, the manufacture refused exchange or replacement parts because it's discontinued product.And the lady, answered phone, had no knowledge about CUSTOMER SERVICE!!Basically, it was waste money and ruined my Christmas feeling.Also Amazon site should stop selling this product ASAP and why there is no negative or zero stars available?."
2,"Paul Newman's first movie, but definitely not his best!","This is another one of those high-budget biblical movies made back in the fifties. This was the first film for both Paul Newman and Lorne Greene who play Basil the Greek slave and Saint Peter, respectively. Some of the characters portrayed here are mentioned in the New Testament, but many of them (including Newman's) have to be Hollywood-fabricated ones. The plot is fragmented and really doesn't tell much of a story. The movie props and backdrops look cheap and historically-unconvincing. Jack Palance's role as Simon the Magician seems so out of place in this film and his acting really isn't the greatest. After a while, this flick becomes so uninteresting and dull that it becomes so easy to get up and leave or change the channel and look at something else."
1,"""War is murder"" quote",You can't read the quote which is a super bummer because it is all about how war is murder. VERY disappointed. Had to give it away to a granola teacher friend. Wish the image or the description text allowed you to know what quote you are getting. The poster itself is a decent quality but I'm so disappointed in what I got that I can't even stretch it to two stars.
1,Not a good experience with Poster Revolution,"Did not have a good experience buying this product. Had to contact Poster Revolution after the shipping date had already passed to find out what happened. When they replied back they said something had happened and the poster had gotten damaged. I had no problem with that, but they then claimed that there were no more left in stock to send out to me. They flat cancelled the order and now when I look for the poster on Amazon it says there are several available and the price went up! Will not be buying from this seller again and do not recommend them to anyone."
2,Starts Off Great........then goes to life support,"The first couple of chapters in this book are simply terrific .The scenes where the author picks up his new motor -home and drives it across country are laugh out loud funny.Then he starts following the NASCAR season (2002) and well......(shrugs) I found myself checking to see how many pages were left in the book.Bear in mind both the author and his wife had media credentials from NASCAR.And this is the best he could do ? Jeeesh.As a fan I look to writers to tell me what I don't have access to.I look for ""inside"" stuff and human interest stories.There is precious little here I didn't already know.If you follow NASCAR there is nothing new here for you to learn.If you're just starting out ""Fixin To Get"" and/ or ""Daytona"" are better."
2,"Interesting subject, tedious author","MacGregor seems to think he's a cross between Hunter Thompson and Tom Wolfe. He isn't. He isn't even close. So you've got to wade through clunky metaphors that last for paragraphs just to get to the meat of this book. The meat is pretty good since the guy did do his research. If you don't mind skimming through the indulgent crap, which is more than 50% of this book, it's an OK read."
1,NOT FOR NASCAR FANS,"I saw the author on television and it was a great interview. As a college educated NASCAR Fan, I could hardly wait to get the book. Reading it was another story. Reading this book is quite laborious -- definitely not pleasurable reading. The author appears to be trying to use every word in the dictionary. After a couple of chapters the book is on the shelf."
3,Good for keystone demonstration,"I got this game to use as an object lesson for teaching the concept of the keystone. It worked well for that. I'm not sure how fun it would be in terms of a board game - it came without rules for the game, but they're probably available online."
1,Quackery,"Aside from a possible placebo effect.. This stuff will do NOTHING to help you sleep. Youll probably have better results taking 4 cheerios. The ""medicine"" is too diluted to have any effect.. Its like tossing a tossing a tic tac into the Pacific ocean and expecting a cup of it to give you fresh breath. Ive seen researchers consume the ENTIRE box of these Before their lectures to prove that it has no effect at all. Its 2010, people."
2,It did not work,I have been having trouble lately with fire ants. I put this around the area. It did nothing to combat the fire ants.
5,Great for pest control without dangerous pesticides.,I used this when there was a horrible county wide flea infestation. We had almost immediate relief and without the dangerous pesticides to worry about. The dog and cat were flea free the rest of the summer.
2,Not good outdoors or drafty areas,"I used this along the perimeter of my front door, but since it's a powder, it scatters all over when the wind blows. I don't recommend it for outdoor use unless you don't mind it blowing all over the place. This product did manage to keep ants away, but I have yet to see any dead ants. The tip doesn't really help with any sort of application precision...the powder mostly comes out in poofs.It might work at keeping bugs away in areas that aren't exposed to drafts. I like the fact that it's ""earth friendly"" but I need something that I can line my windows and doors with and not have to worry about insect powder blowing AWAY from where I need it most."
3,"It keeps ants away, but doesn't get rid of them...","I am having ant problem in my yard. I like idea using organic bug killers around my fruit plants. Once applied, ants won't walk on the soil with powder. However, they just simply walk around the powder and continue invading my yard! Also, it is rather messy to use.After I'm done with this bottle, most likely I'll just get one of those organic insect spray instead."
3,Ok not strong as I would have liked.,I used Safer Brand 5168 around our flower garden when I noticed a couple of trails of black ants trying to move in. I placed some of the powder down as a barrier around the garden the ants for the most part ignored it. I came back two days later and still found a few ants going back and forth across the white powder. It looked like it slowed the ants down but not eradicated them as I was hoping. Maybe it was the batch I had it wasn't as quick as I would have liked seeing in getting rid of the ants.
4,An organic pesticide option,"I have a wife, four children and a dog living in my home with me and it's very important that I keep bugs out while also avoiding harmful chemicals. When I saw this brand name I was worried that it was another company trying to trick consumers into thinking that they were getting something safe to use but really the product was full of unsafe chemicals. I'm happy to report that this product lives up to its brand's name.While there is a blend of bait mixed in with the diatomaceous earth, the product is still certified organic for gardening and farming. Diatomaceous earth is ground up hard shells of fossilized algae that cuts and dries organic material so bugs that walk across this stuff get cut up even on exoskeletons, and absorbs the moisture on and in the bugs dehydrating then to the point of death. It also kills when ingested.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product and how well it works keeping the bugs out of the house and keeping my family safe while inside."
5,"OK for outside use, but don't see that it is foodgrade DE","I will not use poisons in any way shape or form. I really love using diatomaceous earth. However, it does not appear that this one is a food-grade DE. I won't use any in the house around my cats, unless it is food grade. This worked pretty well outside on the ants. Once it is used up, I will clean it out well, and fill the container with food grade diatomaceous earth. If you're looking for outside uses, this should be great. Just be careful not to breathe it. I have also used other things made by Safer Brand, and have always found them to be very good."
4,"Drugs, sex and Rock&Roll...","Colm was a normal guy who moved to Dublin, 'The Big City', from Limerick to begin a new life. After almost being run over at the train station and checking into a Bed&Breakfast;, he goes bar hopping. Well, in this case pub hopping.He meets a girl from a band. Most vampire fans can guess the rest. The story is short, only 115 pages, fast and tragic, but the best vampire stories are always sad - who ever heard of happy vampires? Besides members of the Malkavian Clan, of course.I took one point away for two things. One, vampires in the novel could still drink, eat normal food, have sex and all that. Kind of makes them a tad too normal. The second was the character of Colm's all TOO fast adjustment to being a vampire. He slipped into the part too easily for me to believe.I hope the author writes a few more books, maybe creating some of longer length and greater detail. With less coke use."
4,Quick & Easy Movie to Watch,A very easy going movie Randolph Scott towards end of his career made Westerns his fortay supporting cast is good as well and you knew bad guys were going to get it
3,Decent Randolph Scott Western,"A Lawless Street is not on par with the great Westerns he made with Budd Boetticher, but it is decent in its own way.Scott plays a marshal of a town that is barely holding on to lawfulness. His ex-wife, a traveling performer, comes to town at the same time that the two town bosses hire a killer to take care of Scott with the hope that the town will once again be wide open, and they will benefit by making lots of money.The killer makes a play on Scott, and the town doctor allows the bad guys to think that they succeeded. The story goes from there. Scott is solid and reliable as always, and Angela Lansbury is beautiful as Scott's past and current love. This is not one of Scott's best, but it is an entertaining, fun western."
3,rateing lawless street,".The movie is great, as all his movies are. He is one of my favorites. He sure did his part in the service, and also as and actor, and took care of himself money wise by investing."
2,Dated plans & limited ideas,"I bought this book hoping for plans and ideas for built-in shelves and storage units. The book does a fairly good job explaining the construction basics involved, but it is woefully bereft of ideas. The book is published in the early 1980's and the projects which are illustrated have not, for the most part, stood the test of time. If you are looking for building ideas and examples you can show a builder, this book is not a good starting point."
3,A dated treatise,"I am a great fan of most of Bahnsen's books and articles, but this one was of little help to me in the current moral warfare that is raging across the world. Bahnsen makes a very fine presentation of the biblical argument, but actually falls victim to his own presuppositional approach by assuming that there is something remaining of a consensus of morality on this issue. The book is a little dated [Bahnsen died at a very young age some years ago], and the battle against homosexuality has intensified immensely since his writing. Were he still alive, I would ask him to write a new version of this work.I rated this one down a bit because it simply set forth what I already knew about this issue, and gave me little help going forward. I would have liked to have seen more work by Bahnsen on the foundations and bases for morality. There was some treatment of that vital issue, but nothing new. Liking Bahnsen's writings so much, I am a little displeased to have to rate this one down a bit."
2,"Yes, something's missing","Like a number of other readers, I felt something was missing in this story; it seemed very dark and somehow didn't affirm much that was positive or hopeful. Family tensions seem shelved rather than resolved, and Catherine seems almost to let go of her love for her first husband along with her grief. For a better look at what Rice can do, check out ""Follow the Stars Home."" Even better, get the Hallmark DVD adaptation of ""Stars,"" which tells a slightly different story."
5,Good stuff,The book came fast and it was brand new. The book was crisp. It's a soft covered book but it still made that new hard-textbook sound. :0)
5,Why aren't there more?,"My eight-year old son loves these books. He is not an avid reader, so it is wonderful when we come across a series that excites him. I only wish that they would publish more!"
1,"Don't buy this sticking ""pasta""","I like wheat free pasta and tried this one. It's horrible. It's sticks to the bottom of the pan while you're trying to boil and it sticks to each other despite me adding olive oil to the water. It never cooked properly. I had to throw some away as well. This product sucks, especially when you're used to Trader Joe's excellent Rice spiral pasta."
3,medicore cheap camera,The camera is your basic low end camera.It doesn't work at all on closeups in low light.It's best for daylight indoors/outdoors and/or pictures of things 5 feet away.Software is basic but easy to use.
1,can't a person register a vote for less than 1 star?,"this cd is horrible, don't waste your money on it. the worst song is scarecrow, how offensive. if i were that guys parents, i would sue!"
1,You have to be kidding me.,A half-retarded clown gets killed accidentally by some kids. The kids grow up and the clown comes back from the grave. He feeds THEIR kids ice cream voodoo dolls that he made and once the kid takes a bite his/her parent suddenly turns into ice cream.Need I tell you more? Worthless.
4,"One of the best books on the subject, but you need to know German","I finally got to get a look at this item in the Library of Congress recently, and it's probably the best single pictorial work on the subject of the Sarajevo tragedy of 1914. Virtually every page is crowded with high-quality photographs and artwork, many of them rarely if ever seen in U.S. works, and the book appears to be very well organized. The only shortcoming of the book for an English reader, and the reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars overall, is that it's available only in German. Also, it's very VERY difficult to get, but if you're interested in the subject of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and you manage to get within range of a copy, grab it!"
4,"Hank Aaron = Hero, Barry Bonds just a good baseball player","Honor Hank Aaron and his achievements. A great baseball player and a noble individual. Contrast Barry Bonds. A great baseball player who relied on steroids and, by all reports, a miserable person.I found the hat size ran a little small. Quality is good."
5,Yep.....another Greatest Hits package......,"......and it's coming on the heels of the recent 'Journey' collection.While I'd LOVE to see some new product from Donna, I'm always excited when a FANTASTIC hits collection is released. This is probably the best and most comprehensive of the bunch. While it seems as if they were going for the most complete collection of single releases, there are some questionable omissions (Winter Melody, Rumour Has It, Walk Away, Cold Love, Who Do You Think You're Foolin' & The Woman In Me).Also, I would've preferred the ""single versions"" of 'MacArthur Park' and 'Hot Stuff' instead of the ""promotional single/extended versions""My only other gripe would be that the song credits mis-list the singles from the album 'Another Place And Time' as from 'This Time I Know It's For Real' (which is the title of the first single....NOT the album).Other than those minor complaints, this is a top-notch effort worthy of a place in any great CD collection"
5,A Treasure Chest of Fresh New Innovative Ideas,"I never dreamed kids' crafts could be so much fun. The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions is by far a cut above any other childrens'craft book I have ever seen. In fact, it is almost ashame to called it just a craft book. The ideas are fresh new and innovative. Not only do children have fun they actually learn as they create.Hats off to the authors of this wonderful book."
2,"I'm not too sure about ""Ultimate""","My 8 year old son and I bought this book after seeing the wonderful projects on T.V. I thought it would be a great way to keep him busy and allow us to make things together. Although the book claims that the items used in the projects are found right in your home, I always found myself having to go out and buy the ingredients. Out of the ten or so projects we have done so far, only 2 have turned out right. I must say, even after following the directions to a precise T, the results have been a big disappointment."
5,Outstanding!!!,"This is an amazing addition to the wonderful DVD of this concert, I was so thrilled to find it available and have not taken it out of stereo since I bought it. Love every minute just like I did with the DVD. Pure heaven and total class!!!Janet"
1,terra nova,why does terra nava have 4 discs for only 46 minutes? that is a lot om money for a short period
4,Extras on DVD,"I hope when they'll release the DVD there'll be also included Michelle Branch's music video for the beautiful ""Another Sun""."
5,Exciting Family Show,"I was unsure about this show, so many things on t.v. are so gross. I imagined when a person was killed by a dinosaur we would see every bloody detail of a body being ripped apart! Not so, Terra Nova is exciting, a great love story and wonderful charecters with a lot of depth, yes people die but it's done in a way that is realistic but won't give you nightmares. Can't wait for more!"
3,Why bother?,"This was a pretty good series, but it doesn't make sense to buy the DVD when it is an incomplete story. cancelled too soon, there will be no satisfying ending for fans."
1,Where is the Blu Ray of this series??,"Where is the Blu Ray of this TV series? It's a OK series, but I wished that Fox had given some thought of putting it on Blu Ray!!"
5,If you like campy sci-fi....,Nothing in this show makes sense but I've watched the series 3 times already. Stephen Lang and Jason O'Mara are great but the visual effects are lacking. The extras are okay but I wish more deleted scenes had been included.
4,Great book with good quality printing.,"This soft-cover book is written like a children's textbook, but Hine's photos look great all throughout. There are quite a few full-page prints, roughly 8x6 sized. I'm very satisfied with the purchase; only Aperture would print a book with better quality reproductions, and that's out of my price range right now."
5,Backward compatible with DCT640,"I have a DCT640 and my one year old tossed one of the phones in the toilet. The LCD never worked again on it, and they do not make DCX640 any more. I ordered one of these and it worked! The phone book would not transfer, but everything else worked fine. Even the the old charger works with the phone. One of my other DCX640s has a button that sticks, so I just ordered a second one of these. Its nice to have backward compatibility! Good job Uniden."
5,Good addition to my existing system,This was the perfect phone for me to expand my two phone Uniden wireless system into a three phone system. I will be purchasing another one soon.
