5,Finaly Coming to America!,"Tactics Oger is a asome game. I own the super nintendo version, was never translated from japanese. I can tell that the game has a rich story line, and (even though I cant under stand what they are saying) the battles are fun and interesting. Most of the people who worked on this game later went on to create Final Fantasy Tactics wich has an Idenical battle system. I have been wating for them to create a (translated) GBA port for Tactics Oger Sence the GBA came out, finaly my wish has come true."
2,axis and allies,"Its a great game, only one spends more time splitting up forces to make enough game peices to battle or to place down for purchases, when one buys for new replacements. I called the company and they dont sell more game pieces. This game sucks only because there is not enough battle pieces to play the game. I am forced to buy another game just to enjoy this game! I want to play not spend 20 minutes trying to figure out where to make ends meet to get the game pieces I need. The company could have doubled up on game pieces. THIS IS THE ONLY FLAW IN THIS GAME !"
5,"Excellent account of Jordan's formation, Abdullah & 1948","While much maligned, Avi Shlaim writes an honest and cogent history of Abdullah, Jordan, British involvement in the Middle East and the conflict between Palestinians and Jews leading to 1948. His viewpoint, which many in the dwindling ""Peace Now"" movement share, needs to be understood. The history he writes is like nothing you will get reading mainstream writers like Bernard Lewis. Don't be scared away by those who say Shlaim's writings are ""radical left-wing propaganda."" It is nothing of the sort...simply an opinion based on what we should know any ethnic group is capable of doing to ""others."""
3,Other Opinions,"If you find this book interesting, then check out Gavin Menzies book:""1421:The year China discovered America"". It may shed some different light on all of the Portguese and Spanish explorers. It seems the Chinese explored the whole world and mapped it while the Europeans were still thinking the world was flat and full of sea serpents. The Portguese were the first to receive maps from the Chinese(called the 1428 maps). The Chinese explored and mapped the ""Straights of Magellan"" nearly a century before Magellan."
4,Dixie Chicks Storytellers,"I have never seen this group in concert, so that is why I bought it. They are a talented group of young women and I enjoy every single song. As for the stories, now that I have heard them once - I will probably just skip over them - they weren't that interesting to begin with - but the songs are great!"
2,bored,"Seem like it was written by some sympathizer for jones. Sappy & presupposes dialogue. The was no butler available so blame it on the ""go for"" builder? Come on. I really couldn't get no satisfaction or Stones music score."
5,Powerful Little Vacuum,"I have another one of these I use in my motor-home. I was looking for something that would work around the house for quick clean ups.We have three corgi, and they shed a bunch.This is just the ticket for a fast clean up. Lots of power and it works great on the upholstery.Love it."
1,not even as effective as a dustbuster. :(,Not even as effective as a dustbuster. Very dissappointing. Returned for full refund.
2,It just sucks!,"My husband purchased this vacuum because he thought it would be just what we needed for the one room that has carpet in our house. He also figured that Eureka had a good rep. Boy was he wrong. This vacuum is loud, but that's it. It talks a good game but it left behind a lot of dirt. I was very disappointed because it was a good size and a great price. But now I know you only get what you pay for no matter the manufacturer. I'm going back to the good ole' Dirt Devil."
3,Eureka Easy Clean,"It works well, I guess my rugs are pretty dirty because I have to empty it every time I use it.Otherwise it's exactly way I need for quick pick up. Now I need to by some filters for it."
4,Good for small jobs,"I bought this vaccuum looking for a cheap alternative to an expensive, larger vaccuum. It has worked out just fine. It is smaller, so it is easy to store and it works well on my wood floors and carpet. I have two cats, and it sucks up their hair just fine. Sometimes I have to put a little pressure on it, but overall, it works great."
3,"Lightweight near-toy, but has a special place in my home cleaning routine.","This is dustbuster with a handle and a lightweight plactic roller thingy on the end. I've found it useful for one thing and one thing only, and that's vacuuming the carpet stairs that lead down to the basement. ""Scrubbing"" them with a hose-with-attachement is a prolonged and unpleasant process, and of course the stairs are too narrow just to vacuum with the upright vacuum. So this little vacuum fits those stairs perfectly and gets a lot of stuff off of them. Other than that, it is absolutely no substitute for a real vacuum."
5,very good product,"I had used a same Vacuum for about 7 years for home cleaning. One day the handle was broken and I kept using for several weeks until I got this same model. It is small and light, easy to move around small home, it works very well on blanket and floor, filter is water-washable and reused. Perfect vacuum for small home like dormitory."
4,Great for Small Spaces,We got this to use in our 32 ft. motorhome. It does the job on the small carpet areas and gets in between the furniture easily with its small head. I use a small brush to remove the dust and fuzz from the catcher area when I empty it.This doesn't take much storage space which was important to us.Minor complaint: the catch that slides up and down to remove and replace the dust catching chamber is difficult to move.
2,Too heavy,"As we have two floors, I bought this for upstairs and to use on the stairs. I too heavy to easily maneuver the stairs and doesn't get into the corners. We have pets so lots of hair flying around. I wanted something that I could use like an electric broom, that would be fun to take out every other day. This is not it.It's just too heavy and bulky. I might as well use our big vacuum. But for the price, I guess it's worth it to use once in a while."
1,Using a broom and dust pan is more effective,"I am sorry I bought this vacuum.The canister is too small, cord too short and suction weak .I will have the on/off switch fixed on my 18 year old lightweight vacuum, as it is 10x's more effective.I am very disappointed."
4,Amazing Vacuum,i love this vacuum. I Cant believe my carpet had so much dirt !. Lets see how long it lasts
4,Hard Floor Star,I am COPD patient so I tire extremely easy. This unit is very lightweight with excellent suction and very good on my hard floors.The worst thing about this unit is the latch to release the container to empty. It is cheap and takes a little finagling but the unit is inexpensive. I would recommend this to anybody who needs an auxillary unit for quick & small jobs.
1,Weird Sizing,"I bought this pair of crutches for my 6 year old who is 4'1"" tall. The product sizing says it fits children 4'2"" to 4'8."" I thought that they might be a little too big; but how much could 1 inch really matter? I'm not sure where the manufacturer got their product sizing from because these crutches were TOO SHORT for my son on even the tallest setting, not to mention the fact that the length from the underarm to where you place your hand is oddly short. I don't see how any child over 3 feet tall could use these. Not exaggerating at all, my 16 month old can practically fit in these.I ended up having to buy a different pair and now I'm stuck with a pair of crutches that I don't think would fit anyone who doesn't have 10 inch long arms."
4,Great Pictures,"This book has some great pictures. It is the best book on Jeep history I've seen. I especially liked the part on the Jeepsters.I liked this book alot better than ""The story of Jeeps""."
2,Cute but unsteady,"This walker is quite cute, but the ""legs"" of it don't lock into place. I went to move the walker last night, picked it up, and the walker came apart. How safe is that? The price is a bit high, so I assumed that the quality would also be higher -- but the fact that it can come totally apart by just moving it is alarming. If you need a prop for a picture, then this will fit the bill. Other than that, you should check out other products!"
3,Cute but could be unsafe,"We just bought this for our 8 month old daghter today and while the assembly is easy there were some broken clips that hold the seat on. This could have resulted in injury if I hadn't noticed it. The car is so cool I did not want to return it , so I customized it a little bit by puching holes in the seat and using some strong twine to attach the seat. We are going to call the customer service number on Monday and complain, and maybe get a new seat, and hopfully get them to recall and replace these seats with some better quality seat clips before any babies get hurt. This car walker was made in China, and with all of the recalled toys from China lately I am also concerned about possible led in the paint, who knows. It seems like a good walker and it has many features, that make me want to keep it, and I still think it deserves at least 3 stars. I really like the wheels, and how easy they roll on our wood floors."
1,horrible product,"This walker is made so poorly. First off, the windshield didn't fit into place properly. The seat is attached to the walker with some cheap plastic and is already halfway detached. The little pieces of plastic are breaking off one after the other. My son is 22 pounds and the manufacturer falsely claims that it holds up to 25lb. I am returning it after having it for just one day."
2,OK as a walker (NOT on rugs!) poor as a bouncer.,"OK, this thing took about 7 minutes to assemble and did not require the instructions. It's that easy. The problem - unlike many other walkers, the wheels are small and have little clearance. When on a carpet, they just don't move that well. On a hard floor, they're perfect. The baby can hardly move on the carpet, and the slightest threshold stops the walker in it's tracks.It has height adjustments (the accordion looking supports) that double as the bouncer. Only not that well. A real bouncer works much better. This also leans forward when bouncing and moves around. Tried it once as a bouncer and never again. Yea, it has a cute factor. If you're not going to use this on carpets, and don't plan on using the bouncer ""feature"", then it's OK.Quality - So so. The ""windshield"" pops off easily, and the entire thing feels pretty flimsy. NOT worth the money - at all!"
2,Confusing gameplay,"I had lost interest in this game after a few trys. I found it difficult to move around the ship, and the instructions don't provide much help. The gameplay is confusing and difficult. There were some funny scenes, but not many. Beautifully rendered graphics is about the only plus to the game. So much graphics that it takes alot of hard disk space, and you have to keep swapping the CD's. The game needs a better interface, as the one they provide just makes it that much more difficult to understand what exactly you are supposed to do to solve the game. I give it a thumbs down."
5,Forgot One Entry,"I forgot one entry in the list of Izora & Martha's recorded works:1991- Luther Vandross puts out an album called - ""POWER OF LOVE"".It featured a duet with Martha Wash, the old classic song""I (Who Have Nothing)"". I believe Tom Jones was the original singer of this song. Sylvester put out a disco version of it on his 1979 albumcalled- ""STARS""."
3,"Two Tons O' Fun ""Get The Feeling"" cd","I am glad to have this on cd and my review in now way is against the seller as the seller has nothing to do with how this cd was manufactured. It does not state this cd was remastered and I knew that before I bought it. Having stated that, this cd has hiss in the background and there is not enough separation between the speakers of the various instrumentation on this cd. It's better than having it on vinyl, just a bit. If you're able to record the long versions of their songs from vinyl onto a cd, then do that. They'd sound as good as this cd's sound quality."
5,"I have had this kite, the best kite ever and so easy to fly even off off bridges or over water!","I have had this kite and I give it 5 stars hands down!Pros:No sticksDurableCompactColorfulTail soundsWater ProofYou can fly it off Ped BridgesFly it off of the roof of parking garagesFly it Over waterFly it on your bikePops up on it's ownSimple for children to flyStays up to with good wind you can tie it up and fly a secondCons:Company no longer in businessout of stockI simply loved this kite, i was so easy like pulling a ballon out of your pocket!... and when I flew it down at the river it was so strong in the air the string broke, my fault:(I bought a prism para-foil yesterday and I want some of my money back. The prism para-foil is top heavy and flips upside down and falls! many other cons to the prism brand be wary."
3,"Hard, Hard, Hard!",THIS GAME IS WAY TOO TOUGH!!! The enimies are near impossible to beat! Your Robopon Get scrapped befor you can even attack! I still like that you can make Robopon Though. So this game still has some good points.
4,mopping the floor,these are great to clean tile. Just spritz a mixture of vinegar and water and wipe with these terry mop heads on the mop pole.
2,NOT the same as original SH-MOP. NOT 100% cotton.,"These 3 mop covers come in a plain clear ziploc bag. No SH-MOP logos anywhere. More importantly, the tag inside the mop cover says: 85% Cotton. 15% Polyester. The original SH-MOP cover that came with the SH-MOP is 100% cotton and is labeled Comsentech. BEWARE THESE ARE KNOCKOFFS! Totally lame. I give it two stars because they *seem* similar just from looking at them. But who knows how long they will last with multiple washings. And how well they will perform in the long run. I was expecting authentic SH-MOP covers. I got fake knockoffs. Shame on you ClickyHome."
4,crest white stripes,"Crest Whitestrips Premium Plus, 10-Day Dental Whitening Formula System, 40 Strips. Works O.K., if I remember to do it"
3,"Well, they work","First and foremost, these things deliver on their promise to make your teeth ""noticeably whiter"" in two weeks. I'm not going to complain about that.However, I have noticed the following things:-These things are insanely hard to get into your mouth the first few times. It's a shame there's no ""spare"" strips included, because you're likely to waste a couple. The lower strips especially are prone to getting crumpled up and ruined while trying to stick the damn thing to your teeth.-The gel tastes terrible. I recommend brushing your teeth shortly after you remove them.-You can't really talk, drink, eat or do anything with your mouth while they're on your teeth- even swallowing is difficult at first.-The packaging does not stress that you need to use them TWICE A DAY. I made the mistake of using them only once a day until I luckily saw the note on the package.But, like I said, my teeth look quite a bit better, although this isn't a substitute for brushing."
4,"""East Coaster"" Looking to use Rammed Earth","I purchased this book in order to find an optimistic source on the subject of rammed earth. David Easton does have a positive attitude about the subject. I enjoyed his enthusiasm. I enjoyed the 10 or so pages of color pictures and the many black and white pictures through the book. Like another reviewer, I felt the book lacked some good engineering sketches and some good pictoral illustrations of the forming systems. I was encouraged enough by his book to want to build a rammed earth house somewhere in the coming years. johnkurtz@comcast.net."
4,padded toilet seat,"This item is comfortable, easy to install, easily cleanable, and appears durable. Wish it had matching hinges, tho (they are white on a blue seat)."
1,"Watch on PBS, no specific information on the DVD, Buy the Book Though!","Dr. Hyman's book and longer program are more valuable than this DVD.. and that content is very good, detailed and helpful. I recommend if you want to take advantage of his teachings, skip this DVD and watch this exact program on PBS. Buy the book and his longer program that has greater detail. This DVD is an introduction only, you won't get any specific information from it."
3,"Solid, but not amazing.","This is definately not a complete Greatest Hits collection from Fat Larry's Band. Most of your favorite songs are here but you're missing 'Zoom' and the totally awesome 'Act Like Ya Know'. Like I said, this is a solid release, but not amazing by any means. Pick it up if your a completionist."
2,Fat Larry's Band - Greatest Hits,"Known to music historians as an obscure disco band from the late '70s, Larry James or Fat Larry and his band, was a talented drummer and songwriter who put out a few notables titles on this 1995 compilation. ""Lookin' for Love"" is a dance-floor shuffler in the style of Heatwave's ""The Groove Line"" while ""Here Comes the Sun"" is a personal R & B/dance favorite that sounds incredibly crisp on CD for the first time. When this title was available at brick and mortar stores, the CD was rather expensive due to it being affiliated with an independent label and distributor. It was rare to find this compilation used, but I was fortunate to find a sealed copy on Amazon Marketplace for a reasonable price. I rated this CD low not because it was a terrible compilation, but that the only songs I knew were the ones listed in this review."
5,Readers also Smile,"As usual I was extremely pleased with this Wallander story. The plot is complex, the characters are believable, and I enjoyed each and every page. There is only one more of this series that I have not reads -- I am feeling a. It disappointed already."
4,Henning Mankell Honest Writing,"I love the Kurt Wallander. I get tired of the young foxy female detective and the young sexy male detective and how they spend half of their time shooting smoldering glances at each other and their barbie and ken physical perfection. It was a very good story and the characters are well drawn. The story unfolds well I don't like it too much when the hero goes in without backup, like he does in this one, cause that's stupid, but the rest of the story saves it. I enjoyed this one"
1,This bok is misleading!,"This book lead me to believe that it would give some funny quotes and words from the austin powers movies. However, it had a lot of nonsense stuff in it. I love ustin Powers, but i did not love this book!--"
2,"Not Much to read, Middle Schoolers will like it","This book takes place in a high school, but I found this book to be a very trite portrayl of high schools. Future delinquents will find this book touching."
1,Hard to believe book,"What happens to the main character, Rob, is highly unlikely. I mean, he gets into Harvard with a bad attendence rate and horrid GPAs, it is not possible in real life to get into Harvard, of all colleges, with that sort of record. The writing style was rather dull, not my type of thing. Overall, if you like a little fantasy and sci-fi in a high school setting, you may want to read this. As for me, I didn't like it."
2,What....¿?¿?¿?¿?,"I am 14 and i was very dissapointed by this book. At the start I thought that it was gonig to be really good. When I got further into it I was just asking what? The title leads you to believe that there is a meaning behind the title, but there is none. It just can be reversed to dog was star. What is that supposed to mean. I do not suggest this book to anyone, I suggest you find a more enjoyable book. There are so many out there."
3,Great Summer read,"This is a fun read. The characters and places are well written. Lots of references to New Zealand. The style is light, a bit like Sue Grafton. It will keep your interest, but you won't have to work too hard."
1,nothing new....,Yet again this information is not hard to come by. It like reading techniques watered down from Self realisation fellowship.
1,Doesnt Work,"This doesnt work, the light comes on, but no picture, hoping that a new av cord will do the trick, sucks I have to buy something else to make it work"
3,"Good language description, few useful ideas","You will get a good description of T-SQL, but few if any ideas to help you move on. I would have liked some tips on dealing with SQL SERVER errors. ""Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 Programming Unleashed"" which I already had gave me more useful information. Furthermore, the book also seems to be aimed at C++ programmers. Since I work in a Visual Basic environment, ""Hitchhiker's Guide to Visual Basic and SQL Server"" was a better buy for me. The bottomline: A good beginner to intermediate book, not particularly indicated for VB programmers."
3,Good advice from another owner,"I had problems with water leaking out of the black rubber piece on the back of the machine. Per another reviewers advice, I pulled it out and turned it so the hole was facing down...no problem right away. I was relieved since I was annoyed everytime I brewed coffee. I have had no trouble with coffee leaking out...I don't use the extra filter since we use filtered water from the fridge dispenser. Overall, fine for the price."
2,Rubs Off and Stains,This product rubs off of your skin and gets on to your clothing (or any other fabric -- like a chair or a car interior) and stains the fabric. Not recommended.
2,not as expected,"It would protect your skin from sun.Other than that I would not like to use this product again.For those people who doesn't like to put sticky, greasy, foundation like skin product.... DO NOT USE IT!!!!It feels like putting thick greasy cover on your face all day long and smell like wearing a powdered coins (zinc and titanium dioxide) ... but too strong. I tried to wear it since I feel like wasting $$$$ but I can't anymore. I rather give it away to someone who like it.I think it's really important how you feel when you apply on your face or body as important as how affactive it is...."
5,A truly non-greasy sunblock that does a great job,"This was recommended to my by my daughter when I complained that I don't like most sunscreens because they make my face shiny. It does not have any chemical blocks in it but uses titanium dioxide and zinc oxide instead. I have coverage all day (I do work inside with a lot of walking outside, too) and it is never greasy. My daughter skied everyday for 2 weeks straight using this product and it is the only time she has NOT developed a goggle tan. So, it does really work. We both highly recommend it. Worth the cost."
4,Finally!,I had tried so many different kinds of sunscreen /sunblock but would always end up with redness and rashes on skin (face/arms and legs). This one really works well for me. After a long while of trial and error... I finally found the right one. I gave it a four-star because I would prefer it even better if it's in a clear cream. Overall - it serves the purpose. The price came out cheaper compared to health stores I went to. Yes! I would recommend this product.
4,Very good product - something I would buy on my own,"I'm very fair skinned and I burn very easily. Due to earlier teen years of baking in the sun, my face has been permanently damaged from the sun. As a result, I do everything I can to avoid getting any sun on it.This product, with its high SPF is just what I needed. Thus far (after a couple of weeks of testing it on weekends), it has done its job. I'm getting a bit of color but I'm not burning - granted the color is limited since it's such a high SPF, but hey, I'm not trying to tan like I used to. I'm trying to protect myself from further skin damage and possible skin cancer.I like the fragrance free aspects of it as well. My face is very sensitive and I've had no problems with usage of the COTZ sunscreen.Good product. Recommend it."
1,No buy,"Weird color, makes skin look a little off and it made my skin hurt so i stopped using it, i wouldn't buy it again and have an extra tube"
5,I have vitiligo and really have to be careful,"Because I have a skin condition that makes me extremely sun sensitive, I have tried a lot of sunscreens. This is my favorite."
4,Effective sunscreen,"A small amount goes a long way with this effective sunscreen. It is accurate in reporting the dangers of UV-A as well as the more familiar UV-B in contributing to skin damage and possible skin cancer formation. The top must be removed in order to squeeze the contents (no nozzle or flip cap top), but it comes out easily and is comfortably dispersed onto skin areas without too much rubbing in. Doesn't leave any sticky residue or unpleasant skin discoloration either which is a plus. Convenient size and make, OK for the price."
1,"Sickly tint, not sweat-proof","I am really fair skinned but the pale off-white tint in this sunscreen makes me look even paler and sickly. I could live with that, but after an hour in the sunshine, sweating just lightly, I took off my sunglasses and saw 2 bare spots on my nose under the sunglass pads with the whitish cream pushed downward like a wrinkled sheet into 2 blobs on my cheeks. I've never seen even thick make-up that pushes into globs like that. I didn't use very much to begin with and rubbed it in very well. I have never been so embarrassed in my life. This is sooo not worth the cost!"
5,very good sunscreen,"I love this sunscreen. It goes on very smoothly, the light tint is perfect for my fair skin - doesn't make my face look white like a clown's (in fact it seems to make my skin look better) - and it is odorless. I am happy to know that with its spf of 58 and effectivenss against both uvb and uva rays I am well protected. I also think a tube will last quite a while since it doesn't take much to cover my whole face."
1,"Drying even on hands, RASH on FACE And NECK","This product caused a rash on my face and neck so it is not as advertised "" for sensitive skin"" and it dried the skin worse than being in the sun! I would not purchase again.Why is it so difficult to find a good sunscreen?Very frustrated..... had hoped this would be a great solution with all the 5 star reviews."
1,Ugly effect!,"IF you have extremely sensitive skin and can find NO OTHER sunscreen, you might want to try this product. It works. That being said, do not believe the claim that it dries clear. It is like a very light-colored foundation make-up and leaves you looking rather sickly. It also leaves your skin feeling greasy. I ALWAYS finish products and hate to throw things away, but after 2 applications, this tube went into the trash."
5,"Haunting, mellow, virtuosic, rare, and dang hard to find!","Bought this in 1983 from the Musical Heritage Society as an LP.Probably available in France.Complicated fingering. It's one of those ""Boy I wish I could play like that!""All original. Non-traditional. I've never heard these songs played by any other Celtic musicians. It is NOT Irish."
4,Covers the Bases,"This volume gives the GED student plenty of reading practice in fiction and nonfiction. In conjuction with the reading practice, there are also a sufficient amount of writing activities. Some explanatory text is included in the book, but most of the this preparation publication consists of reading passages followed by activities. In the back of the book are answers, most without explanation or embellishment.I think that this book is best used with a GED tutor to guide the student and give feedback and evaluation on writing activities. For grammar and usage practice, one will need a separate volume. This book covers critical thinking skills, nonfiction prose, prose fiction, poetry, and drama."
4,Have read about 95% and I think,"When I search strings like ""statement command"" it finds the phrase(4 cases exactly). However, the highlighted phrases are a few word off-focused. That is, in the following text snippet,'The Show Next Statement commmand...'""Show Next"" is high-lighted instead ""Statement command"". In this case, two words are off-focused.Additionally, quite a few graphic titles like ""Run to cursor"", ""Step Over"" are hard to recognize.Lastly, I felt a couple of pages are missing although I don't remember exactly where they are.As a overall judgement, I don't regret buying this book. I'm reading this book on my Android smart-phone, too.Take care,"
2,Impossible to finish the book,"For 313 pages I thought this was a great book. All the code worked and there were no problems at all. Then in the 18th chanpter, after entering code to save a PRODUCT I started to get errors. None of the book code from the CD for subsequent chapters works either and there is no errata for this book on the book website and no way to contact the author. While I did learn something in the first 313 pages I consider the whole experience a waste of time since it is IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH THE BOOK OR COMPLETE THE APLLICATION."
1,Laughable,Low budget is one thing...laughable is another. This is a total joke. Stop reading this review and move on to the next movie. Not worth the blank DVD it was copied to. They spent more money on the DVD box cover than filming this abomination.
2,Horrible!!!,"This is the most worst starfox game I ever played! The story line is hard to understand,has good graphics for a ds game,fun multiplayer mode and on single playermode you have to draw lines to get to you enemys. Thats right draw lines! Come on! You could have made this game better nintendo! Do not buy this game! Go buy starfox 64,starfox assault and starfox snes. Thats all!"
4,good little pick up,The game is a fun pickp . i would recamend picking up a copy well you can still find one at a good pricerice.
4,Be Wary Of Real Shipping times,"I have to say that I am disappointed in the Gathering Ground LLC (Gaming Broker)on this one, I ordered this product from them because it was amazon prime Eligible and I got my order in 6 hours before cutoff time for next day delivery (said by amazon ""arrive on Thursday April 26th"") I woke up today to look to see if it was out for delivery and.....SHIPPING SOON....was still displayed on my orders page with the estimated delivery time changed to tomorrow. So I could have chosen free two day shipping on this one and, supposedly, got it the same day, as always, I am absolutely sure the cards will come in perfect condition, they always do from Gaming Broker and its affiliates but not getting it the day I paid to get it was more than a little disappointing...so my advice, be aware that even with prime's next day delivery tag, you may not get your order until 2 days after ordering it, therefore be cautious about paying for next day delivery."
4,Great value for the money,"This compact system is perfect for my child to use with her iPod Shuffle. The sound is not the best on the market, but decent for the price and primary audience. This is a far superior alternative to many of the other i-accessories on the market that will work with a Shuffle, three of which we tried before settling on this one. The only shortfall is that you can't use the Shuffle with the alarm clock. I realize this is more of a limitation of the Shuffle than this dock, but Emerson could be more explicit in stating this in the ad. Overall, I'd recommend this for a child's room, small office space, or use while travelling."
4,great item for ipods,We have two different ipods in the house (original ipod and a new nano) and both easily adapt to this system. It was very easy to install under our kitchen cabinet. You can also take it off the mounted bracket and carry it anywhere. The sound quality is great and it's very compact. I would definitely recommend this item.
2,OFF SEASON,The premise of man hunting man has been around since THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. SEASON OF THE HUNTED doesn't add anything new to this scenario nor is it especially well done.The fade out direction wears thin and exposes the sloppy editing. The movie looks grainy; the background music is annoying and obtrusive. Usually reliable Muse Watson (recently a semi-regular on NCIS) is a victim of the poorly conceived script; the rest of the cast just can't act. The gore is obviously fake.SEASON OF THE HUNTED is not worth your time.
3,"Good mouthguard, but a little bulky","Good overall mouthguard, but it is a bit bulky due to the size of the breathing holes. As a result, it feels a little like your jaw is hanging open, which leaves you a little more open to getting knocked on the chin. Overall, comfort is good, but it takes a bit to get used to. I may go for a thinner one on my next purchase."
2,Good protection but limited air flow,It is great for protection but has very limited air flow. If I get put in a choke the mouth gaurd collapses on itself cutting off air flow. But for sparring the gaurd suffices though can't get enough air during heavy session.
3,ruined,"I followed the instructions to a T, put the guard in my mouth on the bottom teeth first. Then bit down slowly, insuring my teeth were going in straight... But when i pulled out the mouth guard and cooled it, it was crooked and the sides were flat. Tried to reboil but did not work at all! Never reformed shape or anything... I had some tap out mouth guards 2 for 14 dollars and those work ok, but i need something i could breath easier through. This was 14 dollars and a total wast of money. I would not buy this one again."
4,Works as advertised,Provides solid protection from tooth damage ini sparring while providing much needed center port to breathe. I would buy it again.
2,Lasts only 15 months,I have had to replace every 15 months. Quality is awful. Toothbrush is effective but uses batteries once a week. This is after a 7 time usage. Does anyone know of a similar product that is made to last.
1,Only received one set of Hydrabrush replacement,"Item was listed as containing a ""4 pack"" which I thought meant 4 sets of brushes. Only one set was in the box. I received a response from ACTIVE FOREVER but not Oralbotics. I waited for a response from Oralbotics but never received one so I returned the item. Great return process with addressed, postage-paid label. Thank you Amazon."
5,Summary,The product was great. It was exact description. Was easy to set up. Had fun and was happy with everything
2,"Seen one, seen them all.","This unusual compilation lacks interesting narration and contains poor construction. Even the clips, unuseful ones chosen from other movies avialable on other videos, are unfunny."
2,worked great for a few months then died,"I was very happy with this item, I only used it for a total of 5-6 times ... but went to go use it today ... and it won't start/work .... maybe a short in the wiring ? ="
3,"Small, but as advertised","This product arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect condition. It was also as described. Unfortunately, for my use, it is simply too small. The handles are only 1"" around (my mistake for not reading the add closer) and the space between the two handle grips seem very small to me. Perhaps it is because I have not used one of these in a while, but I recall the handles being larger and farther apart on the ones I used in the gym. Overall, I would not buy this product again. Not because it is not well made--it is exactly as described and appears well made. Rather, my personal preference would be for a device that is simply larger so I can get my elbows back farther when doing sitting rows. The price of shipping was a bit ridiculous as well but again, my fault for not paying more attention."
3,goalie pads,"These pads are great for the price. I'm 5' 10'' and got the biggest pads possible,they come up about 5 inches past my knees. The only thing is, when you drop down to butterfly, it hurts your knees pretty good. Grab some regular old knee pads and put these over them and you can drop down as quick and hard as you like. I skate with these and they work pretty well with skates, again, can't beat the price."
3,"Pretty Pictures, but...","Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: ""I followed Amateur and College Rodeos in the late 60's."" I've been in the Arena, behind the chutes, and gone down the road. 'Twas an addictive adventure and I loved it, and still do today. Pro Rodeo is one of the few sports I still follow. Hence, my expectations were high. I should have paid closer attention to the reviews. If you want flash over substance, the photos are nice, but if you want the real nitty gritty, opt for Greasepaint Matadors, On Down the Road by Bob St. John or Rodeo! by Fred Schnell. Much, much better choices."
1,An awful reprint of a great book.,"The editors of this reprint can perhaps clean the glass of their scanner, or (maybe even) retouch their scans before printing.This is a great book, but you better buy a used copy of the original edition instead of this grimy reprint."
1,Great tools but lousy batteries,"I purchased this set in May 2008. These tools are very well built and although they're a bit too heavy, their power more than makes up for their heft. Battery life was great when new but after ony two years of very intermittant use (once every couple months) the V28 batteries no longer hold much of a charge. I'm going to try to get the bateries replaced under warranty with the improved M28 batteries."
4,"Really Great, Until the heroine didn't get her revenge.","I like the book from the very begginning. It is a must read for all book lovers, not just for sheldon's fans. But why didn't she got her revenge? The President got away with what he did to her."
1,Pure and Unadulterated Schlock!,Wow! This is a truly bad piece of writing. There is simply no way the reader might suspend his/her disbelief. This is a story about messing about in the highest places in the land. But the yarn is bereft of reality or even the possibility of reality. Pure garbage. Save your money.
5,MORRIS SERRERO,"THIS BOOK IS A VERY SURPRISE IN THE END, YOU NEVER SUSPECT ABOUT WHO IS THE REALY GUILTY"
3,I was kind of disappointed,"Not one of his best! Sydney Sheldon's first books are much better. Nothing can top ""Bloodline"" or ""Master of the game"" or even ""If tomorrow comes"". He should take more time to write his books, I do not mind waiting as long as I know that when his latest book will come out, it will be as good as one of his first books. I didn't really like ""Best Laid Plans"" - I guess it's because I am not really into politics. Anyways, I bought it in hardcover and I was kind of disappointed. I could have waited for the paperback to come out."
3,The Best Film I've ever read,Sheldon's latest novel is easy reading. I read it in two days and enjoyed it immensely. However one cannot help but feel that th author has capitulated and written this with one eye on the film royalities he will no doubt receive.This book is perfect train journey reading since although engrossing it asks little of the reader in terms of imagination and empathy.
2,"So-so plot, disapointing writing","It seems again Mr. Sheldon has given the public and his fans an out line for a television mini-series instead of an actual novel. Large margins, double-spacing of text and chopped up chapters make this a quick read if nothing else. Where is the author of ""If tomorrow comes', 'Master of the game' and 'Bloodline'? I secretly suspect his secretary is working overtime to churn his last few books out. While I will continue to read Mr. Sheldons novels, I no longer look forward to them as I used to."
2,this is not the best from sidney sheldon.,"sidney sheldon is a very good writer, but the best laid plans didn't leave to my expectation. i think that this is a book that was rushed. his last three books are not that good anymore. his earlier works are very good. i read all of them. my favorites are windmills of the gods, if tomorrow comes, sands of time and the other side of midnight. i hope his next book, tell me your dreams will be equally as good as those four."
3,Kept me awake on my way to work and back,"I was really interested in the revenge part of the book. I didn't like the fact that I had to figure out where the president was during all the murders, and did eye patch man give him the ecstasy????"
1,"This book was not released, it ESCAPED!","Truly, this book is awful.Plot twists? Maybe if you're a 2nd grader.This is a terrible, terrible book.The publisher can keep my money, I wan't my time back."
2,Get a better chanter,I bought this chanter excited about playing and when i opened the box I was pleased with the looks. (thats why I give it a two star. But when I tried to play i could not get one clear note out of it. Also the reed was split down the middle. spend a bit more money and get a quality chanter.
2,Ok for a begginer - BUT!!,"I wrote this review a year ago ""This is an unexpensive practice chanter and the sound is not specially great, but it's enough for a good start. I live in Costa Rica and, as you should've guess, it's impossible to find a bagpipe teacher in this country, but this product gave me the basic knowledge I needed to star learning to play.""I had to change my mind!!At first I was having fun playing this thing but, when I started to play a little more seriously, I realized that this is not a good instrument if you really want to learn to play the bagpipes, it's samaller than the regular chanter and the quality of the sound is poor. I bought a Gibson long practice chanter for about 90 bucks and my playing skills realy improved."
1,Horrible,"Can you say disposable underwear? Because that is exactly what I did after opening the package. I ordered these through Bealls Florida online store. What I got resembles the picture but wasn't assorted. I got 2 green and 1 yellow. The worst part is the fabric was rough, almost paper like. Very thin with a thread that you can literally count. The fabric was so bad you can see areas that are thick and others thin. They are not lustrous or silky as the picture seems to show. The size was way bigger then what I ordered. These are simply generic rip offs from china. Even the branding ""Carole Anton"" was missing from the tag."
3,Hard to Tell since I am the Patient,"As an Early Dementia (55yo) patient in Early stages, I had hoped to review this item before giving it to my family for communication guidance in the coming years. If I picked it up a year ago I am confident that I could have understood the contents, but now I can't."
5,A Must Read,"This is a must read for anyone with friends or family suffering from Alzheimer's Disease or other dementia, whether or not you are a care-giver. Enables understanding of this dreaded disease, and communication with those who suffer it. You will be wiser and more compassionate after reading it."
2,Disappointing... very basic info,"Maybe I had a mistaken impression when I read about this book before buying it. I thought it would give explicit instruction for activities & interactions that caregivers could do with someone with Alzheimer's. It gave no suggestions of topics or activities to do with Alzheimer's patients, & it did not tell me anything I didn't already know about Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It's a general read for someone who's a beginner & hasn't been dealing with AD or researching it on their own for awhile. If you know nothing, this book might help you. If you're already pretty well informed, it's a waste of time."
3,A Qualified Success,"Startling detail is the main strength of this book, but is, unfortunately, applied only in patches. The easy writing style makes this rather long book a surprisingly pleasant read. On the minus side, however, is the decidedly unquestioning admiration the author obviously has for his subject, which leads him to skate over matters such as Grant's drinking. Add to this the sketchiness of the material on the general's pre-army life and you have a book which can certainly be recommended, but only with reservations."
4,Grant Under Rated,"Having been told Grant was a drunken General and President,I find he is one ofthe unsung heros of American History"
2,just another Grant book,This book basically says nothing new about the man. Most of his life is covered but there is nothing that has not appeared in other Grant bio's. There was more to the man than Smith took the time to uncover no matter how many sources he used.
4,"Grant: the ""enlightened"" President?","As a true son of the South, I took a deep breath when I plunged into my first Grant biography. I must admit I completed Mr. Smith's effort with a new appreciation for this wonderfully flawed man. The sections on Grant's formative years and the Civil War chapters move with a nice pace. Smith's inspection of ol' Sam's days in the Executive Office offer a different twist - he portrays Grant as a near-""enlightened"" leader, witnessed by Grant's attempts to ease relations with various Indian factions, as well as attempting to champion the burdens of the freedmen. He does, quite fairly, take Grant to task for the myriad of scandals left at his doorstep. Well done, and a nice intro into any further study of ""Unconditional Surrender..."
4,Rocking Christmas,"The songs on here are both good tunes. The Christmas song is by far the better song though. It is just a really good Christmas tune, and kind of catchy. This album does rock though, I would buy permission to land first though to see how you like them. There is some pretty good guitar work on here which I enjoy being a guitarist myself and the solo in I LOVE YOU 5 TIMES is pretty good. It is worth your money.IF YOU LIKE THIS MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE GREATEST REVIVAL ROCK BAND SILVERTIDE!!!down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.The DarknessJetHurricane PartyParchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)and the best new band Silvertide"
5,Excellent product,My four-year-old son absolutely loves this drum set. We were very happy with the quality and the quick delivery. I would definitely recommend this product. Lisa in CT.
4,An Interesting Civil War Book,"This is a well written book - part of the Civil War Chroniclesseries. It is based on letters written by Major Isaac N Smithof the 22nd Virginia Infantry, who was involved in fighting theUnion forces in Western Virginia. He makes very scathing comments on General John B Floyd and suggests that the efforts of Robert E Lee to get Floyd and General Wise to co-operatecaused his (Lee's) hair to go grey!I found all this very interesting as actions in W Virginia seemto receive liitle mention in general histories I have read.The final chapter deals with his work in the Confederate SecretService after he resigned from the army.The book has some good photos and paintings and also detailedmaps covering the battles mentioned."
1,Dies in 3 or 4 years,"I loved the 28-volt batteries at first but found if you don't use them regularly, they won't charge up fully. After 4 years my initial two batteries would only hold about a 10% charge. At $160 for a new one, I'm switching to a Panasonic hammer drill (I've had my 15.6-volt Panasonic drill for 10 years and the batteries are still great). Anyone want to buy a Milwaukee 0724-20 hammer drill cheap?"
2,High failure rate,"I sure love the way they work, when they work. We've gone through multiple batteries. (All covered under warranty, FYI). They work fine until one day we put them on the charger and the charger indicates defective. No reason is apparent, and so far I can discover no helpful information on why this happens. We have gone through four packs in the last six months. But like I said in the beginning, when they work they work great."
5,Couldn't be more satisfied,The perfume I ordered arrived quickly and was packed really well.I thought the purchase price was great!Couldn't be more satisfied (unless it was free:)
2,buyer beware,"Please note that this is a ""historic"" recording. That is, it has poor dynamic range and clarity and is recorded in monophonic sound. So, from an acoustic point of view, this is quite disappointing, particuarly as the seller did not provide any indication that this was a mono recording or ""historic"" in nature."
4,Holy Cow: An Indian Adventure,This book is a rare mix of first-hand explorations of seven major religions and a frank appraisal of the contradictions of contemporary India.
1,A Very Disappointing Read,"As an Indian raised abroad I was very excited to read this book. I thought that I would share similar experiences with someone who, like myself, was not raised in India. I was sorely disappointed to read the author's degrading commentary on life in India. I felt that it was exaggerated to the point of disrespect to the Indian culture. Ms. Macdonald should not have written a book on her travels to India if she had nothing positive to say. I would not use her book as an indication of what India is like.....her words ring untrue."
3,Marginally amusing,"Good beginning, mediocre middle, fair ending. This book had potential until Macdonald starts rambling about her umpteen religious non-conversions. She definitely captures some of the essence of India and Indians though. I would recommend it if you are traveling to the region."
3,"Emtertaining, good but not ground breaking","I enjoyed Macdonald's travelogue of India. Some of her asides and observations about religion seemed a little forced. This is one of those travel books where the author tries to create a thesis and make her adventures fit into that preconceived structure for the book. However, I got a very good sense of how Macdonald adjusted to this very different culture and came to love it. I recently read Justine Hardy's Bollywood Boy which covered much the same ground but was a little bit better."
2,A book to read after you visit India,"Having lived in India for years I approached the book with hightened expectations that I never found. I have yet to find a book that captures the feel of India in words. This book falls in that category. Definitely a book to be read after your visit. The author's observations are too opinionated and simplistic. Suggest that first time travelers to India stick to the popular travel guides, be open minded and form their own opinions."
4,Where are the shades for his third eye?,"I haven't finished the book yet, but so far it has been a very enjoyable experience for me. It is intresting to see all the different perspectives that people have about my country.I would also add that I think the cover is very cool! Hey even X'men James Marsden got his optic beam idea from Shiva."
1,Obnoxious and condescending,"Macdonald's book deals with a fascinating topic, but her approach to it is shallow, smug, and dull. Her writing style is overwrought and clunky, and her persona is unbearable.Almost every chapter has the same repetitive structure: Macdonald hears about some aspect of Indian religion or culture and decides to investigate it. At first she thinks it's stupid and pointless. But by the end of the chapter she realizes that though it's not for her, it does have something to offer. If she asked for some blessing, she will have received it by the end of that chapter or the beginning of the next. As you can imagine, this structure gets very old very fast.The author's attitude toward India and Indians combines the worst of both the old and the new West: patronizing sneers at a culture she doesn't understand mix uneasily with breast-beating over her own pain at seeing poor people and a greed for exotic eastern spirituality to fill her inner shallowness.(...)"
2,Just OK,"I thought it was just OK - I thought it was mostly cliched, but had enough in it for me to get almost to the end. I thought the ending didn't really match the rest of the book, like it was written by somebody else. It took me back to India, so I liked that, but it was all a bit self centred for me."
2,Not her fault!,Sarah obviously sees the world through the Western norms and thus cannot understand what makes India or for that matter other multi-cultures tick. It not really her fault because she is from a country that has cleansed the local population and traditions to meet the Western norms which according to them is the 'civilized' way of living. Rather than comment on her ridiculous analysis based on a crash course on India and its diverse religions I look at this as a reflection on how India has allowed all views and religions to co-exist albeit with occasional hiccups. That according to some maybe a tad better than fitting all into one straightjacket norm that is defined by the occupiers! It would be interesting to see Australia with an Aboriginal prime minister!!
1,Not for serious readers,"I felt sad after reading the book. That I've lost money on this book!This is both prejudiced as well ridiculing in style. For serious readers there are many well-written and enlightening books on what India is.This books sounds like a ""drain inspector's report "" written in a scorn language."
1,Completely Insulting,"Within the first few pages of the book, i began to understand the author's purpose, simply debase a culture not her own. I grew up in India and i simply could not understand where all the supposed descriptions were coming from. Real beauty or the ability to see it does not come from having a closed and prejudice mind. The beauty that the author looks for is the generic beauty, found all over the world, but India has the beauty not only by the wonderful environment but the spirit of the people as well. This book really does portray India as some kind of savage land and that is something i cannot put uo with."
5,Best book for SCJD,"I am preparing for SCJD & believe me it is one of the best book on market. Javaranch.com is another great resource apart from book. Buy it if you are doing SCJD. You won't find many good books on SCJD apart from above one.BTW: I have SCJP, SCWCD & SCBCD certification to make a point."
3,The Sun Certified Developer Exam,"This book provides compelete guide line for SCJD exam.Offers valuable insight into the core material covered within the SunCertified Developer (SCJD) exam.Introduces the newest features madeavailable by the J2SE 1.4 release and offes discussion of logging,threads,NIO, RMI, regular expressions, Swing and more.After preliminary overview of the SCJD exam project requirements, readersare introduced to a sample project that will be devloped throughout the book,with each project component developed alongside the relevant new J2SE 1.4feature.Which helps to understand better.Sample chapters, Downloadable source code and table of contents are aviailableon line."
4,Good step by step...,"It shows everything you have to know. It's well written and easy to understand. Definitely a big help for getting SCJD. Even you're already Java programmer, reading this book will give you time to refresh your memory and organize your knowledge."
2,"Horrible consistency, and colors don't blend","The consistency begins as jelly-like and devolves to watery and lumpy over time; shaking or stirring does not help. Also, my daughter loves to mix her own colors, but these colors are almost impossible to mix: yellow + red = yellow/red, not orange. We have used other washable finger paints and not had these problems. I would not recommend these to anyone and will never buy them again."
1,Worst Finger paint ever.,"Please do not buy these finger paints. They are the consistency of warm jello, and you can only use them one time after they are opened. NOT worth the money."
1,Poor Product,"I generally love Melissa and Doug products, but this finger paint is horrible. It stains surfaces and skin. I cannot remove the stains from my son's high chair tray or from our bathroom sink. It is a weird goopy consistency - not like paint at all. It liquified and was unusable after a week (and our house is not hot in the middle of winter). All in all, a terrible waste of money. Very poor quality product."
2,YUCK!,"This stuff is so clumpy it is disgusting. The colors do not mix together at all! I got this as a gift, otherwise I would return it. Totally unuseable. (But I gave it 2 stars rather than one because my son still loved mushing it in his hands.) Not worth it though. Don't buy this."
2,Be aware of the unusual sizing chart,"Be aware that size 8-10 is for age 5-7! When I placed my order, the sizing information was not posted. I made the mistake of ordering a size 8-10 for my 9 year-old without that crucial information. The length fit him fine, but he was busting out of it literally! The quality was poor and flimsy. The mask was too small for his head and hard to see out of it (fortunately we did not need it because we had bought the outfit to match a Hasbro's voice-changing helmet that we already had). The belt was way too big even for a grown up. I gave it a two instead of one because the pictures turned out very well despite of the disaterous outfit."
3,need to read,"I have had this device for about a year now and I have been happy, for the most part, with it's performance. Everybody wants to know what it is and so forth. It's so small and mobile, makes for easy travel. On top of that it is surprisingly very durable. The only drawbacks I'd like to note for you are the zoom is not very powerful and the pics when taken in zoom function are not crisp. Additionally the software that is needed to run the product through my computer is nothing to brag about. Actually it slows the rest of the computer down so much at times it will lock my system up. Overall I do recommend to all the purchase of this model and for the price it's a fair deal."
1,dvd did not work,"dvd did not work- it sticked and stayed on the same picture, cleaned disc and put back in and still did not work, if you do not resolve this problem i will not reorder anything from you."
3,It's pretty but...,"I bought this to highlight the waterline. It's a pretty peachy-pink and does give my eyes that wide awake look. This does look pretty on, but I will be returning it because it causes a film on my eyes."
4,Good enough...,"As budget compilations go, this really isn't too bad. If you're looking for something to put next to _Chronicle_ in your collection, you could do much worse than this. I remember buying this on cassette for about three bucks at K-mart, years ago when I was young and broke. It saved me money, and gave me a copy of ""Keep On Chooglin'"", one of the band's quintessential recordings, and nowhere to be found on the oft-touted _Chronicle Vol. 2_. ""Porterville"" is another great song egregiously overlooked by that compilation. And there's plenty else here to enjoy, what with ""Wrote a Song For Everyone"" and Wilson Pickett's ""Ninety-Nine and a Half..."".""Ooby Dooby"" was tacked onto the cd version as an extra track, and as somebody else pointed out, it doesn't really add much. But virtually everything else here is top-drawer material, and for the budget-conscious individual, this makes a solid second Creedence purchase."
3,"Stop! Do not buy this book- ""updated"" version is obsolete","I give the book three stars due to content, but the numbers are all obsolete. The information is now seven years old! OBRA laws have changed, gifting laws have changed, estate tax laws,...you name it. Save your money and buy soemthing that has been updated NO EARLIER than January '03. I am a financial planner specializing in this area, so I cannot- with good conscience- recommend that people adhere to the outdated information in the book- talk to an advisor who is up-to-speed on the new rules."
1,"Worthless after Feb 8, 2006","Dear Worried Reader,On February 8, 2006, President Bush signed a law called the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. This law makes sweeping changes to the ability of seniors to transfer (gift) any assets to their children and grandchildren. Following the advice of any book written before that date can cause a catastrophic loss of Medicaid privileges when a senior citizen is most vulnerable..when they actually enter a nursing home. Do not use this book as a reliable guide to current law. elder law attorney Chicago, IL"
3,Out of Date but Useful,"Provides a useful outline of Medicare law but is out of date. Forexample, it does not have the current estate tax exemption of $1,500,000 and the scheduled phase out. I was left wondering what else is out of date?"
4,Not quite what I expected but still pretty good.,"After seeing the movie ""Amazing Grace"" I wanted to know more about John Newton and his experiences. There are some spiritual gems in this book but, even though this autobiography was updated to 21st century language, I found Newton to be overly pious--even feeling worthless.I was hoping for more details on his years as a slave trader but the sensitivities of the time probably prevented details that modern readers expect.Although I was disappointed in some ways, I didn't expect many of the moving spiritual thoughts Newton expressed. Maybe some of his experiences not described were so sinful and embarrassing that was the reason he didn't go into detail."
2,could be so much better,"this dvd is not anamorphic widescreen so if you have a 16:9 tv your gonna get pinched off ( black bars all around the picture ). If you have a 4:3 tv, this is a decent buy for the price.Also, like the other reviewer said, no 5.1 mix at all.so much potential...."
2,"""Time is Tight"" stinks!","I bought this for ""Time is Tight"" but it seems to be an extended play version. It would have been better to just play it like it aired and extend that, but NOOOOO, they didn't! On top of that, they are off key and out of sync at times during the tune!They didn't exactly pick the best songs for this disc either."
1,stale daler,again the same old daler with same old tunes and same old dance sequences.even the extras dancing around him appear same. i will not recommend it to even the die-hard fans of daler.
5,Just what i needed,Ordered this book on May 30 th and in a matter of days it arrived and was able to get started with some work.Very detailed and looking foward to the work ahead.
3,Acqua di Gio,"I bought this item as a gift, it was a request. I don't know how I like it, but the recepient was very happy. it arrived promply."
5,Beautiful form and function!,"This is another great pan. See my review for the 8"" saute and you'll learn more. I have 5 Anolon Professional pans now, cook a LOT, and these are flat out the best and most reasonable priced pans I have found. This one for [money] is a steal (as if the 8 inch for [money]). They look terific, cook terrific, the handle never gets hot, and clean up well. What more can you ask for? Great pans, highest praise."
5,Positively uplifting.,"Although most of the lyrics are not specifically ""religious'"" there is no mistake of the church influence in this recording. What makes it so special at its best is that the songs seem sincere and earned-there is nothing superficial about Mavis Staples and Pops Staples positive vibes. The band is tight and yet the songs seem spontaneous-a wonderful combination. I don't think The Weight or The Dock of the Bay are particularly effective-they aren't bad, but they seem out of place here. The last half of the record seems to pick up steam as we here one great message song after another. It takes a special gift to take uplifting songs and make them seem real-the Staples have the gift."
4,Well-made quality case,"I bought the brown leather flip case about 3 weeks ago and it's really very nice. The stitching is perfect and the leather is high quality and it looks great. The snap is high quality and when the case is closed it holds the visor securely. My only complaint is that the opening for the beam function does not exactly line up with the beam though there is room to maneuver the visor so that the beam works. Also, the visor does not sit perfectly flat within the case. These are really minor issues and overall I would highly recommend it."
1,Worst ever,"I had a pair of these for many years. When they finally wore out I bought another pair. Big MISTAKE!Somewhere along the way they cheapened these slippers. After a few weeks, the lining came loose and bunched up. Very uncomfortable. Finally, after a few months (less than one year) they wore a hole in the sole.Don't buy these!"
3,Evans open back men's slipper,"Pros:*Comes in wide and large sizes that are difficult to find*Conforms to your foot quickly*Open back makes slipper airyCons:*Linen wears out quickly by toe and ball areas*soles wear out quickly if you go outside to fetch your newspaper or to bring out your trash can(s)Bottom Line:*If you have an odd size foot, you have little to no choice elsewhere*If you are looking for durability and have a usual size foot, this is not for you"
3,$10.50 for standard size springform,I would have liked this better at $5. I need to adhere to a cheesecake recipe for my first try so this cheap but serviceable pan is an okay purchase. I have baked two chiffon cakes in this and the release has been fine.
2,tastes great but is unhealthy and expensive,"It is pricey and has high fructose corn syrup in it. I dont see why they dont make it more natural, is it really difficult to make it HFC free?"
1,Did no work,This item was an item suggested to me by gateway and it did not work.. everything on the package said its compatable wit my computer and it sitll did not work.
3,The new SkyFi2,"This was a replacement for the SkyFi2 I purchased about 3 years ago. (The old one was stolen)The old one would transmit thru the Fm modulator to my auto stereo perfectly. This new one must not have the same type of modulator, as it won't transmit to my auto stereo. It does, but fades in and out and usually with a LOT of static, just like there was no antenna hooked up. It will work fine with the cassette adapter and the gizmo that you have to run out and put on the outside antenna. I don't like either of those methods. I like XM radio, but not the changes made to this SkyFi2 receiver!"
5,Great for people with long commutes.,This is a great satellite radio. It comes in clearly and is reliable. Good product.
1,A piece of junk-- never worked-- awful install instructions,"The unit I received was defective from day 1. The only button on the receiver that worked was the on/off button. I called Delphi and they told me to return it to the retailer. That makes me mad, since I bought it on Amazon I have to pay shipping to/from the retailer for a unit that is defective.I wonder why they don't test units before they ship them.I noticed a few other Amazon reviewers had similar experiences, their units never worked. Unfortunately, their reviews were buried beneath a number of glowing reviews, so I never saw them when I was making my purchase decision."
2,Xm satelitte fm reception,[[ASIN:B0009NMQ2I Delphi SkyFi2 XM Satellite Radio Receiver and Car Kit]]Enjoy my product and have had it about 2 years. Use in home and auto. My problem is with reception in auto when in large city areas the FM reception is terrible. Local FM stations drown out XM signal and it is useless until I get out of the large city areas. Have tried using the other channels but to no success. What kind be done about this?
1,not so perfect after all,"I purchased this item last year. At first I was extremely pleased, but after less than a year the TransTherm base separated from the pot. Since was still under manufacturer's warranty and I had always used it according to manufacturer's instructions, I contacted WMF America. I contacted them several times via email, but only got the run around. Finally I contacted them by phone, only to be told by the customer service rep that this rarely happens and when it does it is rarely covered by their warranty. However, if I wanted to ship it to them, they would be happy to look at it and then tell me they would not cover it. I contacted the CEO of the American division and never received any response at all. How disappointing. They clearly do not excel in customer service and do not stand behind their warranty."
5,"Awesome pressure cooker, first time user","I just received this gem today. Upon opening the box I immediately noticed the construction and build quality which is second to none. This is my first pressure cooker. I had been considering this one and the Kuhn Rikon. I can't compare them side by side (I have never seen the KR in person), but I can't imagine that KR could be any better than the WMF. So far I am very pleased with my purchase and look forward to using it more and more."
3,Handle broke twice,Generally I like the cooker and have bought several for my family and friends. However Later I found one flaw with it. The handle is plastic and thinly connected with the pressure control part. It is easily broken and it costs $80 to replace. I had to replace it twice.
2,why show just clips?,"No, I haven't seen this DVD but judging by the description it is mainly clips of Stooges' MGM material. My gripe is why not release these films in their entirety? Years ago when people still used VCR's, I taped most of this stuff from TNT and TCM. They aired Fugitive Lover, Dancing Lady, Mert & Marge, all of the MGM shorts, Meet the Baron, and Hollywood Party in their entirety. So Turner has these movies. Keep the clips."
4,Rockin Rory!,"Rory Gallagher was the greatest guitar hero to come out of Ireland. It's a mystery why he was never as huge in America as Zepellin,Deep Purple,Clapton etc. As a performer he blew all those guys away, and was the most energetic musician I ever saw play live (opening for Rush !, what a crime, he should have headlined!). Top Priority is top Rory, a great mixture of classic rock, bar band boogie, the blues, and his great story telling songs with images of his view of legends from America (gangsters,cowboys etc.). Rory need to be in The Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame maybe more so than any other blues rock artist at this point."
3,Iron and Silk,"A nice movie that shows some of the contrasts between the way we live and the things that we take for granted can be quite different in other cultures. This is the story of a young teacher, Mark Salzman, who goes to China to teach english. He finds that China is not at all what he had expected, in some ways it is so much more. It explores the relashonships that this young man establishes and how they evolve. There is also some stunning martial arts footage in this film, this an easy movie to watch and should be enjoyable for most."
5,"dated, but excellent for seeing where the field began",This is a wonderful book that spawned a new sub-field in ecology as well as providing a major theoretical approach to conservation issues. Island biogeography provided us with a new way to view biodiversity as it related to space. A wonderful book.
5,Unique History of Japanese Americans in Oklahoma,"This excellent family history was written by my younger sister. As Catholic Japanese-Americans raised in Oklahoma in the 1950's, we knew we were an extremely rare demographic group. The circumstances of our grandparent's arrival in Oklahoma, and the resulting large, highly-educated, and socially aware family is indeed worthy of documentation. This book accurately and sensitively examines the issues of Japanese-Americans in the World War II era, who did not undergo the same treatment as those on the West coast. My father served in the unique 442nd Japanese-American infantry unit, the highest-decorated unit in US Army history. This book is an easy read and will retain a unique place in the stories of American immigrant families."
3,Basic inexpensive feeder,"The feeder was poorly packaged for shipping and came broken - when I went to return and reorder, it was out of stock so we nailed the piece back on. After a squirrel jumped in it, the feeder rope gave way from where it was attached at the bottom, so we had to fix that as well."
4,Good looking and functional,This looks great and the birds love it. Only problem is that the squirrels love it too - but I've given up trying to keep them away.
1,Horrible Product,The kit does not fit a 1994 nissan sentra xe. I wasn't even able to use it because it is meant to be used when you are putting the receiver where the A/C controls are. Don't buy it.
4,"A ""Best Of Live""","Rose Tattoo and AC/DC: the two big names in Australian Blues-rock. But compared to Rose Tattoo, AC/DC would be a progressive rock band ! Yes, Angry Anderson & co play the most straightforward three-chord blues-rock you can imagine with an added punk-attitude. Without the ever-present slide guitar they would probably sound like the Australian version of the Sex Pistols ! Now that all genres are being mixed together and with the right video on MTV these geezers could finally become the hype !"
4,check the date when you buy,"i didnt realize this is from 1994. otherwise the book is fine, but some roads have changed around me."
1,The Last of the Savages,"I found the book dull. Neither the story nor the characters were on any interest. In fact, I found no redeaming qualities in any of the characters. Had I been a Preppie or a Yalie, I would be pounding on the author's door complaining about how we were portrayed. The author insisted on using two long words when one short word would do. I guess that shows his great intellect. I would not read any of his other books."
4,It was better than I had expected it to be,"I was a little unsure if I would like this movie or not. I am a huge Halo fan and love the Halo games and when I watched this movie I actually really enjoyed it. There were a few things that seemed like they could have been done differently and I thought that it was a little slow to start off, but it picked up pace quick enough to keep my attention."
3,Halo 4,"This movie only gets 3 stars based on the amount of time it took for the real action began. For those who play the game, they know the action is immediate. I would like to see more movies like this of Halo but with more of what the actual game provides."
2,Not Bad if you Had Played the Game,"Not too bad but if you had not played the game, you'd be lost. Looks like it's set for a follow up."
3,Could have been much better,"Movie did get better toward the end, but the early half seemed like a bunch of high school kids playing at making a movie.The concept for Halo is great for making an action Sci fi movie and we should have expected much better for this movie given the Halo game's popularity."
2,Too drawn out,"It was only about the last 10 minutes that were ""exiting"" and engaging, where it started to really look like halo, using the same characters. The rest of the movie was VERY long and DRAWN out.....too much time spent on details of character building that had no consequence to the theme/outcome of the movie."
5,Perfect companion to the Halo experience,Exceptional audio and video quality. A well acted compelling story with brilliant production value. A must have for any true fan.
1,Teens action,"This is a new trend to make movies for teens. Mix of simple story, breeze of love, and easy action. After watching 60 min of boring training part, you will be confused to find out that most of characters die in last five minutes by the falling rocks. The Hunger Games is exactly the same style of movie by tempo, design and actors. They add some cult-like mood from Starship Troopers, and new product for teens is ready. It is OK, why not? But, as a consumer my concern is why they choose Halo 4 (violence space-shooter game) as a basis for it? I am the Halo gamer who like to see the alien blood everywhere and I need Halo movie be like that!"
1,Has anyone watched this trailer?,"Has anyone watched this trailer? I just did to see what it is all going to be about, and can you say Starship Troopers? Don't get me wrong I love Halo but this looks like a total rip off of Starship Troopers. I would say rent this before buying. But again thats just my 2 cents."
5,loved it!,"I am not interested in any HALO games or anime, but this was really good. They really should continue the movies just like this one, not animated:) Glad I rented it!"
4,True to the HALO universe,"I have been a HALO fan for years and enjoy the books and games. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this movie - unique story, good acting and quality special effects. However, this is not an action movie, although the action picks up at the end. My wife also enjoyed the movie and knows almost nothing of the HALO universe. Hopefully we will see 343 make another film."
5,Awesome,"If you play the game it, its a must see... It brings the game ne go relief and background about scenes in the game. Pay attention to the names.."
4,Exceeded Expectations,Having no history with the Halo games I was a little hesitant to rent this film. I read the reviews and gave it a shot. This could have been a stand alone movie. It was well worth the time and money.
3,not a bad movie,It does have some swearing so if you have younger children be aware of this. Otherwise it was enjoyed by kids.
4,Awesome,"For the budget and actors, I thought this was so well done. My wife knows nothing about Halo and she loved every minute of it. Wish they could have explained it a bit more because you may have questions if your not a gamer."
5,Awsome!!! I hope they make more of these for Halo Fans.,I really like all the Halo games and have wanted to see a movie like this for a long time.
4,Good,Entertaining. A fun twist to see Halo in live action. The scenes are beautiful and Master Chief is so cool.
5,Simply Amazing,"I went into this thinking it was going to be lame CGI, with lame acting. The characters were truly awesome and believable. The storyline great, and the leaving me wanting so so so much more. I wish they made this into big screen movie/movies. I have always wanted HALO to go to movie form and this did not disappoint. All smiles!"
5,"Casca, the man that is forever, above all, a soldier","Incredible reading. Myself being a soldier, I can identify with this series of books. Recommended to me by a fellow NCO, I went to the trouble of finding the first five books and read them in five nights. I will find the rest an read them. Incredibly gripping and accurate detail. I recommend them to any military history buff. I enjoyed the first five immensely."
1,Jim,"This timer is extremely unreliable, the timer keeps losing time and the off pin does not turn the timer off, it just stays on."
2,"Outdated info, and seems to have a bias against WLS","This book had some interesting info, but the anti-WLS bias is evident throughout the book. SO many negative stories and ""personal testimonies""...I started thinking, if WLS is so bad, why do they still perform these surgeries?I realized that I had to take this book with a grain of salt, and also remember that is COMPLETELY outdated at this point (2010). If you're thinking about WLS, don't bother with this book."
1,Negative Slant on WLS,"This book focuses so much on the negative of gastric bypass surgery that it makes me wonder if the author's research was up to date with the current procedures, death and complication rates. This is the first book that while claiming objectivity was actually negatively slanted. The personal stories were horrifying. For a more objective and thorough book I would suggest ""WLS for Dummies""."
4,A good beginning,This 2 volume series is a good accompany to any European history survey course. It gives a good general overview of historical data and lacks the detail that would be required for higher level course work. The author is opinionated at times which can allow for alternative perspectives which the student/reader may not possess.
2,Hard to read,"While there are a lot of details in this book, they are not presented in a very linear order. Timeframes will jump between 500-1000 years from one paragraph to the next! It's hard to keep track of when, why, and how events occur with all the details and time jumping. Perhaps a good text for a high level college class or if you have previous knowledge on this part of history, but not good for intro level classes!"
2,Civilization of the West,when I purchased the item it came in great speed to me but instead of receiving the 7th edition that I thought I was ordering I received the 6th edition. Which if I knew I would not have ordered from this person.
4,Good Starter,This book was very helpful in getting me started. I didn;t have a background in video but needed to do some work related projects. I found chapter 6 (editing audio) for seperating audio tracks helpful and chapter 7 (transitions) a big help for adding great effects to my videos!It taught me what I needed to know about editting video with this powerful Adobe tool! Love the Bible series.
5,This a quality pan!,"Having no idea what a good pan is, I bought this on other's recommendation. They weren't wrong! This is a heavy, well made pan with a very nice lid. This was my first purchase of this brand and model. It won't be my last."
4,Nice camera bag,"I really like the size of the bag and the fact that I can fit my DSLR camera in the bag with my long lens attached. The bag is comfortable to carry, and I have room for several extra lenses, filters, and other small items. I had previously tried a Slingshot 100 bag, and even though it was very comfortable and easy to access, it was way too small to carry what I needed. The larger Slingshot bags were too bulky for my needs, so this bag was a nice compromise.The bag can sometimes be a little difficult to open due to the fabric flap that covers (protects) the zipper. Also, the velcro separators can be a pain to remove to get to any items under them. However, even with these small issues, I still like the bag."
5,Great for Jerky,"I use my Snackmaster to dehydrate jerky. The 500 watts lets me use up to 7 trays at a time, and only takes 8 hours. You do not have to roatate the trays, unless you want to do them. I run it while I'm sleeping and when I wake up the jerky is done. These dehydrators stand up to years of use."
4,a real workhorse!,"I used this all summer long drying my herbs and tomatoes. I probably had it running every other day with no problems. Now that my garden is done, I'm using it for jerky. It is very quiet and I have no complaints."
4,Great for Jerky!,I recently purchased this because I make Venison jerky. It was quick however I have to agree with one review on here! Be careful about the temp settings cause my jerky came out as crunchy as potato chips!! That is the only reason I did not give it five stars!
5,Great value purchase!,"I purchased this dehydrator a few weeks ago & have made several batches of jerky already. The unit is a little bit of a counter-space hog, but the option to extend up to 12 trays makes it worth it! The four trays the unit comes with will fit approximately 2 1/2 lbs of raw jerky (about 1 1/2 lbs dried), in case anyone is wondering if it is large enough without the extra trays. The machine is very, very quiet compared to other dehydrators I have used in the past & seems to dry jerky a lot faster too. Trays are easy to clean, and so far I haven't had any problems with anything sticking to them.I highly recommend this product. Great results for the price!"
2,Deformed bottom tray,We purchased this dehydrator as our diets have changed over the years and we are trying to eat more Raw and less processed foods. This machine was great for about 1 week. We now have an issue where the bottom tray deformed from the heat and the top trays can not sit on top of them evenly. Disappointed customer.
2,Not Happy,The product works great. The trays all fit together great. The Bottom stand doesn't fit though. So when you stack up the trays it will be a little wobbly and off center.
1,Honda CR-V Remote review,"This product though not broken when it arrived was not in good condition. It is old and dingy, most of the bottons are faded and unreadable. Should have returned it but was too busy! Not a good deal for the price."
5,Wonderful Collection,"My daughter would not sleep without her nite nite train when she little. Over the years we lost the cassette we had. She is 11 now and I found the CD so I got it for her as a keepsake.Well, she uses it every nite again!!!!!!"
1,Save Your Money,"This book is stretched between a technical manual and a coffee table book way too tight. Hunn covers the larger manuf. with research that could be found on any historical website, and briefly touches on the rare and obscure in general descriptions. Do not rely on this book for technical information. Simply order specific parts lists for the motors you have. I would like to know if Hunn's other book was better as a picture book, as this one was too poorly written to be of any enjoyment."
3,It was better towards the middle to the end,"I think Jimmy Fallen is funny as heck. But this ""Best Of"" was slow moving in the beginning then towards the middle it picked up."
1,How does this guy continually get away with it???,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews listed here. This guy is not funny. I don't get it. I don't see how anyone can seriously give this 5 stars. As a life long fan of SNL, it pains me to see this guy continually grunt out a very bad Adam Sandler impression....and no one seems to notice!! If I had known I could make a living at it, I would have ripped off Aykroyd's bits years ago!"
5,The Best of the Best,"WOW! This DVD is so great! Speaking as Jimmy Fallon's Biggest fan, this DVD is the perfect addition to anyone's Jimmy Fallon collection. If you love to laugh, then you'll love this dvd. The Best of Jimmy Fallon features all of his finest moments as well as what we've all been waiting for, the moment Jimmy got Lorne Micheals to laugh with his Sandler impression that landed him the job. Plus, we get audio commentary by the man himself!And I said to myself, What a wonderful world! I am going to run my ass to the store and grab it the second the doors open!!Vanessawww.fallonized.com"
2,sucks!,"i have to be honest, also. i mean jimmy fallon is just not funny. maybe he can play a villian in Sin City 3 though :):):)'2 stars since it is SNL :):):)"
2,Being Lucky,"This book left me with a lot of questions about the main characters,Jonathan and Kevin.Also, the title,""Because You're Lucky,"" disturbed me. What does luck really have to do with a child having a good home, loving parents, and nice friends?? I enjoy most of the author's books, she is a fine writer. This particular book,did not end or set too well with me."
3,Pretty,"Its very small, but very noticeable in public and lots of people will stop you and ask you about it.The lcd screen makes the pictures you take look better than when they appear on your home computer screen in .jpg format.The serial connection is what you can expect of a serial connection, pretty slow.The flash is detachable, that comes in handy.It can take up to 32mb smartmedia flash and with that you can store maybe 200-300 pictures.It defaults to 1024x768 resolution, you have to manually set it each time you turn it on to do 640x480 if you want that res.The picture quality is amazing on up close shots, but fades and blurs on medium to long range shots.the flash will only do good in a medium sized room, doesn't flash strong enough for a large area.The batteries will drain quickly if you use the flash each time, or the lcd screen alot.i got this for 50 bucks so i thought it was a great value!"
5,Tylers Review,"This is a very nice cameraand i have used it every day since i got it.i take it everywere.im only 13 and i can operate .my lil brother is 7 he can operate it,this is a great camera becasue it is light weight and it has a nice col0r and design.the only bad thing is that the battery drains realy fats.o yeah and on the specifications it says that the camera does not have a self timer but it does."
4,Everything I needed to know I learned from the Toltecs,"As a Spanish teacher I am always interested in cultural beliefs and practices of the ancients. I think much can be learned by going back to simple things such as these four things.Ruiz has a nice style, but the only drawback I found was the first couple chapters took away somewhat from the impact of the rest of the book. The stars are lights, lights are stars, etc was kind of out there. I found myself putting up with that part to get to the wisdom I found later in the book.I found these four agreements useful and I loved the book overall. I just think some people won't get to the good stuff because the first part is so abstract.It's only my opinion. :)"
3,Good for People Who Don't Find Time to Read,"These cards basically outline the major points made in the Four Agreements book. Since I had already read the book and remembered most of the points when I bought the cards, they were a little disappointing. However, if I had not read the book at all or if it was many months later when much of the information was no longer retained in my memory, I can see where these cards would make it easy to recall things on a daily basis. They make a great gift for someone who has never read the book. Actually reading The Four Agreements was much more satisfying though."
1,Beyond bad,..and not in a bad/good Plan 9 from Outer Space way at all. This is an absolute classic example of wasted film money. Truly terrible...truly avoid this rubbish.
5,better than triancinolone for chronic skin inflammation in 73 y/o grandmother,"For two years, my wife has had about a 10 cm chronic skin lesion on her lower leg. Probably a result of banging in to the dishwasher cover when it was open and she was not paying attention. She had been to the dermatologist many times, with several different steroid Rx, some more potent than others. The redness and itching would come and go, with flaking, disomfort and recalcitrance (that's a doctor word that means it won't go away). Starting this Derma product abut two months ago, the lesion appears to be gone. We must wait and see if it returns, but so far, this product is dynamite."
3,Ignores Mac,"While I like the book, the fact that it is ignorant of Mac (9 or OSX) commands is disappointing. Basically, Photoshop books today respectfully address and discuss both PC and Mac issues. This is standard. All the great Peachpit Press books, for example. If I had known that the author was a PC guy and not going to address any of this, I would not have purchased it. The cover makes no mention of this. Additionally, there are other errors in the book as well (as in directing you to a disk file which is misnumbered).Maybe this is my pet peeve, but I wasted time today figuring out how to do this stuff on a Mac when I wanted to be figuring out Photoshop techniques instead.There are other books which are just as good...if not better. Next time I'm sticking with Scott Kelby for this type of book."
5,Another great read from Ernest Holmes,"I haven't read an Ernest Holmes book I haven't liked or loved. This was no exception. For anyone who is a follower of Science of Mind teachings or wants to learn more about it, this is a great one. I wouldn't recommend starting with this book, but definitely add it to your reading list!"
1,Not Too Impressed,"Bought my cat these and the golf-ball looking sponge balls. The golf ball sponge is really well-made, these not so much. The black spots of the soccer balls are poorly applied and the sponge is poor quality...one cat kick or bite and these will fall apart. I took the rest of them away from her. She loves her golf balls and they have lasted through all her antics with no show of wear and tear. Spend the money and get the other ones!"
4,A Familiar Bird,"I have a special interest in this bird since I flew as a crewman on them when they were first deployed to the far east in a ECM role. (Electronic Counter Measure). It had been the first navy plane equipped specifically for ECM work. The book does touch on the use of the plane but is focused more on the its design and development history and physical details of the aircraft. A reason for the limited detail of the planes use could be because ECM patrol activity was and is highly classified. It surprised me to find a book dedicated to the P4M since less than twenty aircraft of this type were produced. The most important role played by the aircraft had been its use in ECM work, both in the far east and in Europe. The book will be interesting to aircraft buffs, particularly those interested in obscure aircraft types and uses.."
2,An eye-opener,"Interesting, if for no other reason than to see for yourself the nature of the ""true believers"" of the Left. We now know that Americans participated in Stalin-inspired Trotskyite hunts within the ranks of the International Brigades. While Merriman almost certainly met his end at a Nationalist firing squad, how many American Reds met their end at Merriman's orders? The writing style of the book was in the nature of a justification of a cause that was morally bankrupt, even in the context of fighting fascism. I recommend the book to anyone who wishes to better understand the mindset of liberal thinking . . ."
1,>>>> VERY DANGEROUS!!!!! <<<<,"I have had one for a few years and was using it last night.. I heard a pop and noticed that it seemed to be jammed because I couldn't squeeze the 2 small levers any more. Well, the popping sound was the spring breaking inside and flying into my nose like a nail gun!! It sank a good 1/2"" into the skin inside my nose and when I pulled it out blood just poured out of my nose like a water faucet. I was close to dialling 911 since I had never seen that much blood spray out of my nose before. Luckily I got it to stop bleeding about about 30 minutes. I STRONGLY suggest you do not use these until they modify them to avoid springs from shooting out. I can't imagine using these on ear hair or eyebrows?!?! I would be blind or deaf right now!!!"
1,Terrible Scam,"I ordered a bouquet of flowers I saw on the Internet, the name of the item: ""Seasonal Color's Bouquet"" Pay attention, it says ""BOUQUET"". But, when the flowers were received by my daughter, there was no bouquet but a box with a few flowers. I sensed the big disapointment of my daughter who was celebrating her 40th birthday. I wanted to surprise her and I got her terribly disapointed instead. I was absolutely left down by this terrible company.This company should show the exact way the flowers are presented to whoever is receiving them, otherwise they are terribly misleading people and we all know the name of such action : SCAM.I will never again order anything from this company EVER !Lita Bryant"
2,Aerosmith Performance,I bought this because there are very few DVD's with Aerosmith Live. This DVD first and foremost is half talk with people from the UK - very British accent and basically says these guys were great but a bunch of Drug Addicts. It said released this year but the information ended in the Early 90's. The only thing that has a bit of shine of light - is the history of the albums made by the band. Otherwise I am very sorry I bought this and feel cheated for the money spent. The FAN club members for Aerosmith should have a bit of outrage over this release!!!
5,Glide,"I grew up listening to this as a teenager, and the track ""Glide"" was, and still is the jam. As for the other cuts, I'm sure they are alright, but buying this album means having that one super funk classic in my archives, and that was worth the price. Glide gives off the feeling of cool urban modernity mixed with the hard funk groove that has somehow gotten lost in more recent styles of urban music.Scott Comar"
5,Young children loved it.,"Would you believe I recently shared ""As You Like It"" with my second and third grade second language learners and it was a huge success. They were enthused about the plot and the characters from the first reading, they never got bored. I guess it says something about Shakespeare's writing.We ended up doing a little rewriting and turned it into a reader's theater, I don't think Shakespeare would be too upset with our adaptation.We're presenting it with a cast of sixteen next week, hope ""we break a leg.""It's amazing to here the children talk about Rosalind and ""Ganymeade', as well as the evil duke and the happenings in the Forest of Arden.Lets see if this stays tucked away in their young memories when they have to study the bard in high school and college."
3,Confusing to someone new to the craft,"Being new to the craft, this really confused me. To me alot of the spells seemed to be on the edge of taking anothers free will.Then, again, that's just my opinoin."
2,Poor performance in low light situations,"I'm afraid I had to send mine back because it didn't do well in low light. The owner's manual recommends a camcorder light for all indoor settings, and specifies that a light is required for anything darker than an office with fluorescent lights, or a room lit by fluorescent light. I found this to be true, and the camcorder would not work at all indoors unless there was plenty of light. Since I sometimes use my camcorder for museums and other indoor settings, it just wasn't appropriate for my needs. When I called the Samsung help line to make sure I wasn't just doing something wrong, they explained that this was just a limitation of this model.Other than this limitation, it's a good product with lots of nice features for a great price. It was easy to hook up and run, and the sound was good. It's compact and solid-feeling. I gave it two stars based strictly on the fact I had to return mine because of the lighting needs."
5,Product exceeds the advertisement,Outstanding color and finish. This is a first rate piece of furniture that fits in with some rater over priced Ethan Allen furniture that I have.
4,"Great Songs, Great Playing and Improvising, Too Many Arpeggios","I looked forward to buying this set, but was disappointed when I started listening to it. Tatum loved arpeggios; I find them irritating -- an elementary and unmusical way of filling in the end of a phrase. Some songs have as many as 10 -- makes me scream with disgust. The great jazz pianists never use them -- Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck, Marcus Roberts, George Shearing, Andre Previn. I could name more, but you get the idea. If I could edit them all out, I'd give this set 6 stars if Amazon allowed it. I even toyed with the idea of selling the set, thinking I could never listen to it again. Now, I listen to just one CD every month or so -- that way the arpeggios don't bother me so much. I didn't want to be critical enough to give it 3 stars, because everything else about Tatum's playing is the best, and the choice of songs is outstanding."
3,"Awesome movie, terrible dvd","Woohoo 50th annoversery of Godzilla, a DVD with a free soundtrack cd. What more could you want. A LOT! I love this movie, ever since a kid I've loved it. BUt ADV have released the movie with no trailers, interview, no anything. Not even scene selection, you must fast forward to whatever scene, hell, there isnt even a menu. And to top it off its a cut version. My old VHS copy contains more scenes of the monsters, why on earth did they take them out!? Anyway, I'd say just by the video and copy it over to dvd. AT least that way you can add your own menu and some trailers from the internet."
2,"Decent, but highly overrated.","Summary: It's 1999, and Godzilla, along with the rest of Earth's mightiest monsters, must fight to stop the world from extra terrestrial take over.Often held as being the ""Godzilla Masterpiece"", this movie falls short of being an epic. True the scenes with the monsters are interesting as always, but they are few and far between with a lot of rather boring human action spread throughout. Even the giant monster battle at the end is more like a brief skirmish.Overall, not the worst in the series but certainly not the best, either.Next is ""Godzilla's Revenge""."
2,Des. All Mon.,"The Plot is exelant, but the picture is realy, realy, bad. They don't even show mothra as an adult. Only larva! It's like the movie ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"" only with a lot more monsters such as Mothra, Manda, and Gorosaurus."
3,Starts out stupid but gets better.,"Alright,the hype was too much.I had great expectations.I think this film could have been so much more.The acting was below par but not awful.There was also too many spaceship scenes and that took alot away from the story.The scenes of the monsters rampaging through the world's cities was just about 30 seconds combined.WAY too short!The final battle scene,however,saved the movie.Just that scene is enough reason to buy this movie."
1,not worth the cash,"Dont get me wrong, it is a ggod movie. However this set is the dubed version DVD no menues and a music CD. Basicly you will be paying extra for the CD because the movie is 10 dollars."
1,"Watch me was better, but this one was terrible.","Very predictable plot, only fair writing. The review that said ""serial killer fiction"" was right on the money. Gory for no good reason, and the serial killer is really poorly motivated (don't know what that reviewer meant about a view into a serial killer's mind -- what nonsense).This one was not worth carrying home from a plane trip. Pick it up in the first class lounge at JFK, where I left it."
3,My so called life goes on fail,What happened to angela? oh I could not stand her in this book I loved the twist of fate with brian but thats about it. I would love to see this book written again but with more realistic people like in the show
5,Rory does it again !,"I only saw Rory Gallagher once. Shea Stadium, opening for Robin Trower and Jethro Tull, 1976. It poured down rain and I fell in a puddle.Anyway, this album was recorded about that time, and it is an excellent represenation of live Rory. Irish Tour was another great one. A blues-rock master captured at the top of his craft !"
4,Feedback,DVD arrived safely and securely and timeously. Enjoy learning and practicing the Wild Goose routines and to spending time each year with teacher.
3,SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM ART,"Instead of the usual acoustic quartet Art's group here consists of Cal Tjader's group-- Mr.Clare Fisher electric piano, Bob Redfield guitar, Rob Fisher bass, Pete Riso drums and Poncho Sanchez percussion. Cal Tjader himself joins the group for the final three lite bossa tunes. Does he bring the extra percussionist with him or was he playing all along. This information is from THE PENGUIN GUIDE TO JAZZ RECORDINGS which dosen't like Clare's tone but praises Art for his playing on Cherokee."
5,This is history.,"I have listened to these two albums probably hundreds of times. I see Big Star's influence in all kinds of modern rock music. Nirvana. Afghan Whigs. REM. Superdrag. The Pixies. Counting Crows. Matthew Sweet. Alex Chilton practically gave birth to the leader of one of my other favorite bands, the Replacements. These song sparkle and shimmer with life. They convey desperate teenage love, boredom and heartbreak again and again, as well as the sometimes morose feeling one gets when trying to define his or her place in the universe. Chilton and Chris Bell reference drugs in one song, then God in the next. And while the lyrics are mostly sad, rock and roll redemption comes through on every track. If you really want to understand rock and roll as it is today, buy this CD and see where it came from."
4,Unfairly neglected back then,"Big Star definitely puts the power in power pop. Songs like 'Ballad of El Goodo', 'Thirteen', 'September Gurls' and 'Back of a Car' are outstanding pop, plus the songs are timeless. For a history listen of R.E.M.'s and other 80's jangle pop group sounds, this is the signpost album. Contrary to what was said below, I believe Big Star blows Badfinger away in the music department, though Badfinger wasn't a slouch either. I've had this CD for years and I still play it regularly. Not only that, my kids love it - and they weren't even born when Big Star was around!"
2,So whats the big deal!,"Well I have been hearing of this lost pop group for about 3 years now in various circles and underground music puplications. So I read the reviews in these pages and decided to finally order a copy of Big Star #1 Radio City. Boy was I disappointed! I even put myself back mentally to 1971, I was 17 at the time and I still heard just a ton of unstructered hap hazard cliche licks and 22 tracks of filler between the two good cuts."
4,a masterpiece,"These are my favorite Big Star albums by far, and they really show how the band was different from any other American group that I can think of at the time. #1 Record is my favorite because it epitomizes the band's stylisic range: it contains relaxing, beautiful songs such as Watch the Sunrise, pop-aspiring songs such as When My Baby's Beside Me, and a should-be classic rock standard, Don't Lie to Me. Radio City is also a great album, but other than September Gurls, You Get What You Deserve, and I'm In Love With a Girl, I get the feeling that many of the other songs, while still good, seem somewhat repetitive (not O My Soul, but that's also not one of my favorites). #1 Record deserves 4 and a half stars and Radio City 3 and a half, but I'll just give them both 4. Big Star is vastly underappreciated, and these albums are a masterpiece."
2,Not for beginners,"This dvd is about 50 total mins, with the breakdown of: introduction- 4 mins, core work- 19 mins, leg work-9 mins, full body work- 12 mins, cooldown-6 mins. Poor production quality, irritating instructor, and I wasn't loving the flow of exercises. I felt like there was an annoying amount of deep breathing exercises in the beginning and then most of the other exercises required either a lot of flexibility, or were just hard. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone looking to get their feet wet with pilates."
2,Great Idea But Device Not Very Accurate,"I like the idea of having audio alerts for distance, speed, calories, etc. when running. Unfortunately I found this device's GPS tracking unreliable and inaccurate. I ran a course of a known distance, and on several attempts using this device I got several different milage and speed results. In addition, my split times were all over the place. Also, viewing the maps on their website showed varied locations. Thus, while I like the idea, I would not recommend this device until their GPS issues are improved.I have since tried a Garmin GPS device and found it to be very reliable."
5,"All I Can Say is ""Wow""","I have become a huge fan of A. C. Arthur. The book ""Unconditional"" was amazing. Abigail was stronger than she realized. Along came Mason, who had issues of his own. He came unbeknownst when she needed him the most. I felt the uncertainty of life when faced with the diagnosis of cancer. Ms. Arthur set herself apart with this book. She pulled me end and held me from page to page. This should be a movie. It will reach a broader audience. It should premiere I October, for breast cancer."
1,Filter does not do its job...,"The filter screen is quite coarse. It will catch pieces of cork and crusted sediment, but all of the fine sediment passes right through it. You start with a cloudy wine, filter it, and it remains just as cloudy."
3,Lots of recipes but no pictures!!!,"I bought this book as a present. I am middle eastern and my friend loves to cook our food. There were lots of great recipes in there but no pictures! When you click on the ""Look inside"", it makes it seem that there are pictures in the book that go along with the recipes but that is not the case. There are a few unrelated pictures but unfortunetly none that go along with the recipes. That would be fine for me because I know what the food is supposed to look like. However, if you are someone who'd rather see what the food is supposed to look like or wants to cook a food you've tried in a restaurant and need to identify it by picture before making it, this book is not for you."
4,Tasty and simple,Tasty and very simple recipes!! A great starter for those wanting to learn the basics of middle eastern cooking. It is the Betty Crocker cookbook for Middle Eastern cooking!
3,more like two and 1/2 stars,"This is the first Sandra Brown novel I have read. I read it because it was #1 on a list of romances of the century. The hero in this story, Cash, is vulgar and unappealing. I could not relate to the romance of this novel because i found him so repulsive. For the majority of the book, the heroine, Schyler, is spineless and a bit of a door mat. I just could not relate to the characters. I will read more Sandra Brown, in the hopes that this one is not a reflection of all her work."
5,"The steamiest, sexiest, novel by Sandra, I loved it.","Slow Heat in Heaven is the steamiest, sexiest novel I have ever read by Sandra Brown, I loved it. The story kept my body tingling, heart pounding, my imagination working overtime. She makes the reader feel the sexual tension, the angry, the disbelief, the whole nine yards. I love this book so much, I can't give my girlfriend back her copy until I get a copy of my own. I can't stop rereading it."
1,Skip this book,"To the earlier reviewer from Seattle that claims this book gives the romance genre a bad name: I couldn't agree with you more. This book is cliched and overripe. Kept waiting for the best romance of all time to unfold. It doesn't. The ""surprise"" ending is one the reader can figure out by the end of the first chapter. The familial relationships are contrived. The Louisiana Cajun setting is interesting, but the characters are not original or engaging. Let me put it this way, ""For those of you who like Sandra Brown's style & storylines, this is another book you will like."" But for the rest of us, leave this book ON the shelf."
5,This will have you breathless...,"I have the originals of most of Sandra Brown's books. This is the most erotic and sexy book I've read of hers. Others have been sexy, but not to this degree. A deep secret is forbidden to all but a few and this being in the swamps of Louisiana in a town called Heaven, there's a whole lot of hell going on. You think you know something, but you find out later you didn't. I've read this one over many times and love it more each time I read. Go ahead... take a little taste of 'Heaven'!"
2,for non painters,"this book and aviva gold's ""painting from the source"" are the same. they consider the final art work not such important than the creative process itself. the book is useful as a healing therapy involving art, but can not be considered as a source of imagery and worthy themes to paint. Against painter's crative blocks, the book ""the blank canvas"" could be better. If you are an artist looking for inspiration, look elsewhere."
1,Link Broke,Chain broke when 55lb dog ran and hit end of 15' lead. Would not buy product again for a large dog.
5,technologically ahead of its time,"Hard to add to what's already been written. I've been savoring this CD for 15 years-- I agree with an earlier reviewer who essentially said this was the height of the trio format, although I gotta give Brad Mehldau props, too.The thing (besides the playing, of course!) that's always stood out for me is the quality of the recording. Given the date (1961!!), the sound is outstanding-- right down to the crowd noise. It sounds as if it were recorded last week. The sound of LaFaro's playing in particular is exquisite.This should be right next to Kind of Blue on everyone's shelf."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I am not as enthusiastic about this album as the reviewers that wrote before me. I often find the Bill Evans trio to be unbalanced, with the drums taking more prominence than they perhaps merit. I was tempted to give the recording three stars. However, I recalled some of the better flashes of brilliance: the absolute, near-telepathic tightness of track 01 (Gloria's Step), the intensity of track 03 (""solar""), Scott LaFaro's compelling bass solo on track 03, and the sublime compositional content of ""Jade Visions.""Important historically, so I recommend it to jazz lovers. Everyone else should be wary: decide whether you like it by listening to the sample tracks on Amazon before purchasing."
3,Too Dark for My Tastes,"First, I confess: I'm not a big short story fan. I prefer the longer works, which have time to develop characters and drama. The characters in these short stories left me feeling like they were detached from the world around them - sort of a surreal existance. And a bit too dreary for me. I like works that make me think, but these just felt ... bleak. And there's enough of that in the real world; when I read, I read to escape."
4,"Interesting, and good","Of all my sea salts this fares well. It is strong and has a slightly different flavor than plainer varieties. Truthfully though, I'll reach for Fleur de Sel or Himalayan Pink before this one. But if you want to try several, I'd recommend giving this one a shot."
5,RACHEL GIBSON HAS BEEN ADDED TO MY FAVORITE AUTHOR'S LIST,THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT FIRST EFFORT. I LIKED GEORGIE AND JOHN AND THOUGHT THAT MS. GIBSON DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF MOVING THE STORY ALONG. I ALSO LAUGHED QUITE A BIT WHICH WAS VERY REFRESHING. I HAVE OFFICIALLY ADDED RACHEL GIBSON TO MY LIST OF FAVORITE AUTHORS AND LOOK FORWARD TO HER NEXT WORK
3,Cute but Kindle version has numerous typos,"If you can get past the typos (completely incorrect words and punctuation), it's a fun read. A little long but light &fun."
4,Alyssa Bruce,I loved this story. The ONLY thing I hated was the the handful of typos. They drove me absolutely crazy !!!!
3,A quick read....,"I finished reading this book yesterday and I'm giving this book 3 stars. I thought the heroine Georgeanne Howard was in interesting, sympathetic. and likeable. The hero John Kowalsky to me didn't seem as well rounded as Georgeanne and I didn't see WHY he liked Georgeanne except for the fact that he SERIOUSLY LUSTED after her. Every time he saw her he wanted to have sex with her. I thought that was annoying. Only once at the end did he in any form say that he loved Georgeanne. I couldn't understand why he loved her, except for the fact that she was the mother of his child Lexie. I also didn't like the part in the middle where there was a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING that could have been explained in Georgeanne had let John explain. I like to read romances where there is more of an emotional connection and no so much a physical connection. So in that respect this book disappoints."
3,It was a romance,It was a good fluff book. Not much thinking required. I would have liked a little less back and forth with the characters or it to be played out a little different.Ok for a romance.
2,Could have been better,"I started out really enjoying the book, but I didn't like the 'I hate you but lust your body' attitude both characters appeared to have. In other romance novels, of course the lust is prevalent, but there is usually some inkling of how the characters feel internally, even if they don't orally express their feelings to each other. I loved the daughter, but I didn't like John being able to stay away for seven years and never appear to even think of her. Then when they are reunited,and realizes he has a daughter he wants to marry her? A little stretch there. The book was okay, but could have been so much better."
2,Needs editing,Many errors throughout this story made the flow of reading difficult. The story was kind of bland with no real peaks. It changed perspective often without a clue or additional paragraph spacing to indicate a change.
5,simply good,"I have owned this book in hard copy for a really long time and when I saw the great price on Kindle I had to snatch it up. One of the reasons I fell in love with Rachel Gibson, you won't go wrong."
4,Cute book....,"Easy read, good book after a hard week at work. I quite enjoyed this book. It was nice to read an earlier book of Rachel Gibson, her writing style has improved over time."
2,"Save your $20, useless for locating aircraft.","The sub title ""A guidebook for locating historical aircraft sites in California."" is misleading at best. This book won't locate ""squat"". It gives vague lists of aircraft with NO location directions / maps. (I counted 3 actual directions in the entire book) No maps, latitude, longitude or Township Range & section, nothing for the rest. Example: ""1940s North American P51D #44-73698 USAAF is located in Providance mountains. Site is unmarked."" Well,... Gee thanks, now I have only to search the entire mountain range. The book breaks CA down into regions of about 22,500 square miles, maybe I'll just search the entire area and blunder upon the aircraft listed. The author knows a lot but does not share it. If you want to locate aircraft, save your money."
1,Atopalm MLE Body Lotion,Doesn't work! You want a good all over body cream- try VANICREAM. My whole family uses it; even my 2 yr old son who has bouts of mild eczema.
3,Great learning toy but shapes don't fit together,"I love Melissa & Doug toys because they are educational, innovative and lead-free. However, though this toy is great because of the educational aspect and the magnetics, my son and I were disappointed that the shapes don't align and fit together properly because they have rounded tips. This makes it hard to make the patterns it comes with. If your child would be frustrated because they want it to fit perfectly, then you might consider their other pattern block sets in the wooden box. They have a Beginner one and another one which has more pieces. These have straight lines because they are not magnetic. Here are the links to these two products.Melissa and Doug Pattern Blocks and BoardsMelissa and Doug Beginner Pattern Blocks"
3,"Fun, but...","After only a few uses, the paint is chipping off the edges of the pieces. Also, the pieces get stuck in the frame, under the lip. Like, really stuck. I'm all for the kid figuring out how to fix problems on her own, but this one is just annoying. I had to use a screwdriver to get one out. Seems like the issue could have been avoided with a slightly different design."
4,Fun Read,Really enjoyed another one of Monica's books. Fun read with some deep underlying messages.Looking forward to reading the sequal now :)
5,Interesting and Delicious,"This is a wonderful cookbook. For those of us who thought buttermilk was just a tangy milk product full of fat, THINK AGAIN. In reality it is better for you than regular milk and has less fat. It makes recipes tastier and better for you too. This book starts out with the history of buttermilk and takes us in to why it is so good for us. Very interesting reading. The author gives us ideas in the introduction on how to make special cooking butter that saves calories time and money. Then come the recipes. They are easy to read and follow. They are delicious. I am looking forward to using this book for many years."
4,Non-cumbersome approach to studying the Bible.,"This is an excellent work for a new believer or for any woman (regardless of race) who is in need of a little persuasive encouragement when it comes to actually STUDYING the Bible. It's short and easy. You could easily read it in a couple of hours, which is a good thing if you don't have a lot of time on your hands (such as moms, students, etc.) and want to grab hold of some techniques to quickly get started. The techniques, by the way, are not complicated at all--very manageable--just simple steps to draw out God's message. The author also gets personal. She reveals the journey which brought her to the realization that she (and we) need to be a little more proactive when it comes to Bible study. I highly recommend this book."
2,Pathetic Sound,"I own an older Polk center speaker, which I bought after comparing it to other center speakers in the store. I've had it a few years. I purchased this speaker based on reviews on Amazon.com. I expected great sound, based on its 5-star ratings. I was disappointed. Voices sounded tinny, with no fullness. This means poor bass response. The highs were clear, maybe too much treble. I requested a refund."
5,Great value for an MP3 player,"I was a little apprehensive and was not really expecting a lot from an affordable MP3 player but this is great. Initially I just wanted a handy and tiny player for my trips to the gym, but I practically use it every chance I get. Great sound for such a tiny thing. FM reception is great too."
1,Not User Friendly,"When I opened the package, the blade fell out and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get it back together. I have not even been able to try this product out to see if it really does work or not!"
3,loading is difficult,"Product is great, but with arthritis is difficult to load. Suggestions appreciated for that task. Will have my spouse give me a helping hand"
3,ok,"It worked okay the first couple of times but the blade became dull very quickly, I had hoped and expected it to last longer."
3,"Does its job, but cuts skin in the process","I recently ordered the Tweezerman Safety Slide Callus Shaver with Rasp and at first sight was reluctant to use it. The shaver is not bad at all, but the blade sure as hell is. I needed to peel off some dead skin, so I tried to lightly slide as directed on the instructions, and it would continually want to sink in deeper causing bleeding. The product works, but it hurts in the process."
5,Love it!!,"This thing works great! I feel 2"" shorter now, and my feet are as smooth as a baby's bottom. If you are troubled by rough, calloused feet, buy one of these and get busy. You'll be glad you did."
5,"Outstanding, intuitive introduction to applied statistics","Although now somewhat dated, this book remains the best general introduction to research-grade statistics for the nonspecialist. Kachigan has a special gift for giving intuitive motivations for difficult techniques. If supplemented by a good problem set, it provides the best available general survey for most MBA-level students, and should be readily accessible to undergraduates.It would be really nice if it were brought up to date to accommodate tree-based methods, local regression, bootstrap, and several other ""modern"", computer-intensive techniques. Even so, it's my choice for my MBA class."
3,"Not bad, but a little predictable","The premise of the book seemed a little strange at first - why would anyone want to trick their fiances like this?! Seemed kind of weird. But once the plans were put into action, the results seemed pretty predictable. However, it was fun reading, and moved pretty quickly, didn't drag. I liked it enough to read other books by Celia Brayfield!"
4,I would buy it again!!!,"I have not completely finished the book yet. If you follow it correctly it will take you several weeks. It really makes you think about your life and gives you new hope. I don't have a horrible life but I can feel myself slowly getting to a place that just feels great! I have noticed a change in my life already. Positive thinking and forgiving really does work!!Some of her theories are a little ""out there"" (like picking our own parents) but I just look past them and move on to other things.Buy it if you are truley ready to be happy and make serious changes in your life. You have to be ready to really look at the real reasons why you are the way you are."
1,It's the SAME THING...,"... as You Can Heal Your Life. It's disappointing because it's pretty obvious the author just wants to make money. Oh, sorry, but she isn't qualified to help us heal- find a therapist!"
4,Entertaining book!,"This is not really a nuts and bolts kind of business book, although there are some concrete ideas peppered throughout. It's more of a morale or confidence booster for the small business owner / entrepreneur. It tries to help you avoid pitfalls and build enthusiasm.I would say it is best for two audiences:1) You're a small business owner and are feeling stressed, down in the dumps or afraid failure is around the corner. This is a good book for helping you think creativily and not lose your focus and drive.2) You're thinking of starting a business and you've read a bunch of books that make the whole thing seem daunting. The book will help you rediscover the entrepreneur that is maybe running a little bit scared inside you.NOT a primer on running a business, incorporating, bookkeeping, etc. It is a little bit more ""touchy-feely"" than a lot of business books, but I enjoyed its breezy style and found it a nice tonic for some of the stuffier (but important) other books out there."
1,Extremely poor,"This book will teach you everything you need to know about putting a database on the web except how to put a database on the web. It describes how to make a basic database and how to make a basic web page, but whenever the subject of actually connecting the two comes up, the author says the scripting is too hard and you should hire a consultant.This book is a complete waste of money."
3,"Good info, if somewhat outdated",Good basic info for getting your feet wet in entertainment - but many of her examples are about 10 years out of date. This needs a new edition.
5,great movie,"Great movie, great price. Awesome kid movie about friendship. Good for adults too. My wife and I really enjoyed it."
3,Not bad at all.,"An enjoyable story. Focuses on relationships, neatly ties up at the end. I would think if you want more of the sense of the hurricane itself, you may enjoy Isaac's Storm instead."
4,Opened my eyes to what happened...,"I found this book to be very interesting and captivating. Although I have lived with hurricanes all my life in SW Louisiana, I had no idea of the magnitude that struck Galveston in 1900. Although the characters were fictionalized, this book is based on true events. After reading it, I did more research on the storm and what the people in Galveston went through during that time. So the story drew me in and made we want to know more...and to me, that is a ""good read."""
4,Loved it!,"Really enjoyed this book. Very educational. Suspenseful as well. I couldn't put it down. The fictionalized parts, mainly the love story component, were fairly predictable but still a great read. Gives a good picture of what it must have been like during this horrible disaster."
5,Wonderful houseboating magazine,"Just received our first issue of Houseboat Magazine and read every word. Some terrific and fun articles, such as revamping an older boat complete with detailed photos, and naming one's boat, providing lots of inspiration. Printed on quality weight glossy paper. Happy to be new subscribers to this fine publication."
2,"good brother, bad partner","i agree with saki. it was a good book but i dont understand why the hero loved his sister more than the heroine. his kindness to his family does not make up for what he did to alana. he never even said sorry. even after chapter 27, when he found out that alana was good he still continued to treat her the same way, he was still taunting her knickerbocker background. this book was well written but it's true that when it comes to romance it was disappointing.i was also wondering, in the end when alana was about to pack her things and leave, she was feeling sad when she was thinking of ""the tender times she and trevor laughed together"". what was she thinking about??? there were NO tender moments before the third to the last page of the book! even in the last page, the hero never smiled at the heroine. if you want to read about a great brother, then trevor is your man. but if you want to read about a good partner, stay FAR away from him."
2,"Good book, but...","...you never know if he loves her or not. i think that's the problem with the story- even in the end he was still mean tp her, w/c is bad for a romance novel. on th other hand, u are sure Trevor loves mara which is kind of funny. I think that's why other readers are upset becaus they dont like how trevor was willing to sacrifice alana for mara. everything he did was for mara, mara, mara, mara, etc. even in the last page of the book u can tell hed do ANYTHING for mara but for alana ur not sure. for trevorm, everything he does is for mara, mara, mara,... always. Some find it sweet but i dont bcus it's all done by hurting alana- are u forgetting this? Poor alana >:("
4,Good book but the end leave you hanging...,"Barbara Paker, makes Miami and the Cuban community come alive, however the ending leave you with a lot of questions. Let hope she continues the story line in her next book."
3,Worthwhile,"This is a decent and interesting novel to read. I got drawn into the characters almost immediately and found some of the literary devices pretty clever. However, the scene where the main character performs felatio on a corpse I could have done without. The conclusion was also not particularly satisfying."
1,Spare me ...,"Mann has really gone downhill with this one. It ranks right alongside the worst of Anne Rice for readability. The writing stinks, the story stinks. Was this really written by the author of Men from the Boys?"
5,Stimulating,"I had purchased the book several years ago, but just never read it. Picked it up a few days ago and began reading -- and I couldn't put it down. I was challenged, motivated, inspired -- to examine my own Christian walk. These young men were living examples of Jesus Christ -- to people who may never have heard a ""preacher"". Their ability to deal with their frustrations, differences, and disappointments in such a Christ-like manner really touched me. I want the Epic Life that they found!!!"
5,"If you like WEEN, VODA is heavy duty for your rocking machine!","These guys are super hi-energy on the fast tunes (eraser, bring the vapor) and totally off the wall on the groovier tunes (is it boiling, crack rock). I bought this disc at one of thier shows in Kalamazoo MI in 2001. It was one most favorites out of my 150+ CD's, then.. one day.. it was gone! I thought I would never hear crack rock again. Its one of the best strange songs EVER!But I've been searching the web in vain every few months in hopes of finding it. After almost a year I found it, and I've been rocking in ever since!"
5,Ella and Duke swing hard on this outstanding recording,"This is one of my favorite Ella Fitzgerald recordings because it is the one on which she swings the hardest. I think this recording gives us a glimpse into Ella's talent for swing that made her a sensation at the Savoy ballroom with Chick Webb's band in her early career, but with the addition of mature musical artistry that she had developed in the intervening years. I read somewhere that before a joint appearance with Ella, Sarah Vaughan was warned not to get into a vocal battle with Ella on a fast song because ""she will tear you up."" From this recording, one can hear the wisdom of that warning. The Duke Ellington band also swings harder than usual. I think Ella, the band, and the receptive audience pushed the performance to new heights in swing. In addition to some of the swingingest singing that she ever recorded, Ella also delivers one of her finest ballad performances on the hauntingly lovely ""Something to Live For."""
5,new edition is out!,The reprint is finally out and available on the Brooklyn Museum website. Don't know when Amazon will get it!
4,"Very Good book, Good service and a fair price.","Except for postage costs increasing the price, this sale was excellent.Two thumbs up."
4,Much improved,"Contrary to a previous reviewer, I think Fast Moving Cars is a step up from their previous material. O.K., maybe they rocked a little more in their previous efforts, and they lost some of that raw adolescent appeal, but they show much more mature and developed some writing here (James' lame effort ""You Know Everything"" notwithstanding). And, I may be in the minority here, but I think the more lush production by Justin Niebank really enhances their sound and those great melodies. In my opinion this is their best album."
4,Took awhile,"I had seen the PBS special and got hooked. So I got he CD. Don't understand all the songs, but the ones I do move me to tears sometimes. He sings heartfelt. Second best album I ever bought, wish I could get it on tape for the car."
4,Montez mellows out,"WATCH WHAT HAPPENS was originally released in 1968 as A&M SP 4157 and was his last domestic release on the label. Although it's a studio album, some of the tracks have crowd noises which make them sound live. Montez' vocals definitely had matured by the time this album was released, compared to his early '60s rock and roll teen idol sound from ""Let's Dance,"" and the mood of this album is subdued, compared to that of his earlier A&M albums' party atmosphere. A complete reissue series of this vocalist's work should also include THE MORE I SEE YOU- CALL ME (A&M SP 4115), TIME AFTER TIME (SP 4120 - reportedly due for Japan import release), FOOLIN' AROUND (SP 4128) and the 1983 A&M of Mexico release, with all tracks sung in Spanish, CARTAS DE AMOR."
1,How old is this product anyways....?,I gave it one stars for this reason; the kit is so old that its only compatable with cassette decks only. No where in the description does it mention this and sadly this is the only kit i know of for my car. The stock deck had a casette but damn i didnt think that they didnt make a new product for this by now...
4,Nice Little Amp.,"I don't know why this has such a weak rating. I am a musician thats on the road once in awhile. I use this to warm up real quick before going out, or if I'm writing music and want to hear something other than the strings ringing when I'm by the computer. This has really helped me with alot of stuff. It's not a amp to buy if you wanna use it like you're primary amp. It's just a little toy to warm up on or carry around with you when you need it. Like if you where to go on vacation and wanna play real quick it's there. The sound isn't too bad for a 1 watt amp. I personally love this little amp. It's well worth $40.00 bucks in my opinion."
1,Mini Marshall,I was very disappointed with this item. it sounded like one of those old am radios my dad use have
1,poor quality,"I bought this item for my strato because I am traveling around and I needed a more handy amplifier. It lasted less than a month. I do not know what is wrong with it, but the only sound that this MS2 is producing is similar to a fart. It saddens me to hear my guitar sounding like this. It is very cheaply made and it is overpriced considering the poor quality of the product."
3,Watch out! The Teletubbies are coming!,"My 22 month old LOVES watching Teletubbies on PBS. I thought I would try a DVD and see what she thought. She likes it, but it doesn't hold her attention for very long. Also, I bought this three pack and probably would have been good with just one."
3,Wood flawed in my set,"The pencils work great, but in my set the softest pencil had a design flaw. I think the glue they used to connect the two halves of the pencil together was too hard, or too much. Whenever I sharpen the pencil, it catches on that glue seam. Because the ""lead"" is so soft, that jolt tends to break the charcoal just within the wood. This leads to never-ending (very, very careful!) sharpening, and a pencil that I probably only got about 25% use out of."
3,good choice,Good choice for beginners but needs more detail. Explainations much better that microsoft excel help!! I still need more info though.
1,excel formulas and functions for dummies,Did not give me the information I needed to set up a data base and transfer the base to a mailing in word. Disappointed wasted my money.
1,Terrible,"This cable makes a fuzzy image, it may not be shielded. Whatever the case the seller wouldn't respond to my question about returns either.."
3,"Pricey, and you really only use the nail scissors","I think this is pricey for what you get, but I think that all the kids nail kids I've seen are also similarly over priced. The nail scissors are nice, and work quite well. I just wish they were a little safer. i am constantly worried that I'm going to leave them out and my baby or toddler is going to hurt themselves with it. I wish the scissors themselves had some type of built in cover. The nail clippers are fairly useless, they broke almost immediatley after I used it for the first or second time. And I've never used the other products. But the nail scissors are quite handy and work well."
1,Warning... Terrible waste of money,"I, like another reviewer, bought this on the basis of one sole good review, and no bad ones. I must say, this product is absolutely terrible. Very bad sound quality with a buzz in the background. To add insult to injury, you cant even close the battery lid after you open it the first time around!"
5,Sterling Silver Boy Head Charm,"We are extremely happy with the outstanding service we received from ""Sabrina Silver"", as we just received our two charms, packaged beautifully, and in RECORD TIME! Please accept our sincere appreciation, AMAZON AND SABRINA SILVER, for all your EXCELLENT customer service! It shall be our pleasure to do business with you again, at the very next opportunity! Most Sincerely, Dennis & Patricia, Green Valley, AZ :)"
2,Better off reading American Psycho,"Here's a book about a man who has everything - wealth, good family, but he wants more. The main character has sinful urges that he tries to fight off unsuccessfuly. Sound familiar? Well, this was written before American Psycho, but this book takes forever to get into the good evil stuff and is a lot less descriptive. It is drawn out, but Selby does a good job of painting a picture of this man's mind and making you want to see what this is capable of. But it comes so late in the book and by then you are like, yeah so? Eh, decent read for fans of Ellis masterpiece."
4,Into that dark place again,"I was immediately pulled into the story of the young intelligent Manhattanite and his dark habits. Selby again delivers a stream of powerful inner monologue that humanizes his character even as he seems to lose his humanity. The character's descent is incredibly convincing and you empathize with him at every stage of deterioration. It's a very absorbing story.However, it isn't quite Last Exit to Brooklyn. It isn't perfect. In my opinion, the story went on too long. The last third was only needed to drive home the spiritual theme, which was better left implied.That said, this is a powerful story and very enjoyable read. This isn't a portrait of a psychopath (one who lacks conscience). It's a portait of a man possessed."
4,Soulful,"As always, Selby manages to write from the heart and from the depth of his soul, honestly, though often overwhelmingly brutally, exposing the evils of humanity and the demons against which we humans fight daily.In The Demon, Selby follows the life of Harry White, a confident and an intelligent businessman rising on the ladder of success. Throughout the novel, the reader experiences Harry's grievances and his denial amid his self-destructive, sociopathic behavior. His constant battles in balancing his family life and his work life lead to his demise and his emotional downfall.Selby engages and encompasses his readers' attentions with his infamously unique style, and takes them on a journey of understanding and, hopefully, self-discovery to those who connect with his writings."
4,Entertaining Exciting Awesome Band,"I had never heard of this band until I saw them on the brotherhood tour with Los Lonely Boys. While LLB BORED the crowd with over two hours of loooooooooooooong ass guitar solos....ozomatli had the crowd jumping around and clapping and truely held everyone's attention to the end of their set. this band is truely entertaining to watch...all ten members are always doing something different. The singers are talented, musicians are talented, awesome band...........you won't be disappointed as they rock out to different songs...something for everyone. sorry for the broken thoughts...mind is working faster than my fingers."
3,dom.,"i mainly liked the dominatrix chic , she was cool and cute and yum, enough said.....enjoy the beating men.."
5,Good horns...,"These are good horns.The tone could be a little lower and they could be a little louder, but they sure beat the heck out of any stock horn.Theyre the best you will find in the price range.Any negative reviews are probably just from people who dont know what the hell theyre doing.You cant just bolt it on and run a wire to the compressor, there is a lot more work involved than that.If you are not mechanically inclined dont try to install them yourself, otherwise go for it.I think theyre great...."
5,Words that come to mind:,"1. Shows the absurdity of my thinking I knew how to parent...2. Shows that ""Parenting Skills"" is king of oxymorons...3. ""A-yun"" is now my decorating style of choice...4. ""To Halliday"" is the verb I now use to describe the hide-&-seek of a preschooler's laundry...5. I now extend the 10 second rule for fallen food items to minutes, maybe even days...6. I smile every time I see a babysitter with young children...7. I smile WIDER every I see a mother with her young children...8. I have totally fallen in love again with my stay-at-home wife...A WONDERFUL read, Ayun... I rolled on the Maypo-&-Cheerio-encrusted floor the entire time, cover-to-cover... Give us more, please!"
3,OK... not what I expected.,"I thought this book would be more along the lines of the ""Girlfriend guides"", by Vicki Iovine, but basically it was one mothers story of having and raising her two children. This author seems likable enough, but I just didn't really relate. She seemed more bohemian than my friends and I. And being a ""suburbanite"", I also couldn't really relate to her way of life in the city. If you're an artsy type, and live and work in the arts, then you'd probably find this book more interesting. Ayun Halliday also writes in kind of a disjointed sort of way, alot like a run-on sentence. This made it hard for me to follow at times. Overall, this book was amusing enough, but definately not a great read for me."
1,Expected better,"I disagree with most reviews posted here for one major reason. I absolutely cannot relate to the mother in this book. My days as a stay at home mom of 2 toddler boys consists of shopping at Target, potty training and praying that I make it through dinner time without losing my voice, my patience and my mind. Halliday, however, writes about the perils of getting her children into the perfect private preschool, hobnobbing with stay at home socialite moms, and the trials and tribulations of her husbands advancing career. Not a bad book, just not good for those of us who would have liked to use the 3 minutes of peace we sometimes have to read about somebody else in the same boat."
4,"Wonderful, this tome!","It is rare that a book so squarely centered in the personal is written without contrivance, egomania or grandstanding. Ms. Halliday writes a book here that is honest and welcoming, inclusive and generous, written with clarity and precision. I, for one (my husband for two), am honored she would bring forth such a treasure.I don't find the comparison to Bombeck accurate, as Halliday doesn't have the same raucous energy on the page. She has a lyrical style and grace in her documentation that evokes Neruda, Cade Bambara, Wright, de Beauvoir or Joyce.This is an exceptional work for anyone who loves to read, and most expecially mothers -- of any parenting philosophy.Three unreserved thumbs up!"
4,"Great product, Lousy Customer service","I love my DLX Assistant. I have had it for many, many years. The power has been lost however because it needs a new belt. I have contacted the manufacturer many times about how to obtain various replacement parts and never even get a response. That is my only disappointment with this product; lousy customer service on the part of the company that makes it or distributes it."
5,Manhattan GMAT is the best!,"This stuff isn't taught at high school or college. I learned soooo much from this book, it's just amazing.CON: Not free. I didn't buy it before taking my 1st test. (Scored 480 and studying for 2nd test)"
5,An amazing book,"This book has everything you could think of and more. It gets into specifics such as not only shoes but tennis shoes, pumps, loafers, etc. Everything from the stars to ecology to animals to things around the house to kinds of tools. This is one of the most usefull translation/dictionary books I have seen. If you like to visualized instead of reading a word this is very helpful."
3,To many Keys!!!,"Ugh...this is not at all what it would appear from the titles! If you want endless, mind-numbing and annoying tinkly piano pieces, this is your CD. I bought it for the quiet ones, and there are several. I would like to rip the tuning the piano pieces off of the CD and start again. It seems the people in the 17th century want music that made them nervous and hyperactive and have seizures!!"
1,Very disappointed,"I'm very disappointed with this product. As another review said the top portion is very weak. I have only had it in a medium strength wind and it is bending. I'm concerned about what will happen in a strong winter wind. Also, I got this flag pole specifically because it would fly 2 flags. However, when trying to attach a second flag. we had to put the top of the second flag in the same place as the bottom of the top flag. I expect that I'm going to have to replace the pole. I also got the holder that corkscrews into the ground. It too did not work as described. We were able to work around that problem."
1,JJ Flats fall Flat,I should have taken the other review to heart...the new recipe is HORRIBLE...i can't even give these a 1 star compared to the old product...WHICH IS WHAT IS SHOWN HERE...the old packaging and the old product...if I could return these I would ...to say they are horrible compared to the old recipe is being kind...go back to the old recipe.
3,AGhost in the Family,I thought that this was a good book. I liked how Betty Ren Wright described the book. After every chapter she leaves you with an exciting ending. My favorite part was when Chad was sleeping and the snake came after him. The main characters are Chad and Jeannie. She gave them great names. I think that this book needed to have illustrations to show the reader what was going on. This book was exciting and full of adventure. I also think that this book needed to be longer. Anyone who enjoys mysteries would like to read this book.
5,Nice color / price,"I like the color a lot. It's a nice dark bloody red color. If you apply 2 coats, it would look very dark and you can only see a tinge of red under the sun. I did not use a base coat or top coat, and it lasted 3 days before it started chipping off."
4,Lindo color,El color es muy bonito y las uñas quedan brillantes!Le doy 4 estrellas porque en los extremos se me ha desprendido un poco y solo tengo 3 dias con el.
4,Finding Christ through new lenses,"In the search for the more authentic Jesus, William BArry provides an excellent work for moving beyond the Biblical Jesus to a Jesus with skin on! BArry's chapters start with the familiar and gently challenges with the unexpected. It's as though one rediscovers the amazing qualities of an old friend! It calls us to look at Jesus with new lenses. A book well worth reading for ones own devotional studies, but also one well worth using for small discussion groups, where Christians are searching for a more real and challenging experience of Jesus."
1,Clearly they dont use their own product.,Clearly they dont use their own product.the pinching tip can not be used to grab a staple in a railroad tie or fence post and pull it out.The bull nose can only be ground out to a pointed tip in order to grab wire/staples etc...
5,Fencing Pliers,"Purchased these for barb wire fencing. These are a good size. My wife has small hands and my are medium. We both are able to handle these plies and get our job done. Seem to be well made and not cheap looking, a great tool."
2,wrong picture and description,"This is a high quality product at a competitive price, however the picture and product description are not accurate. This product is good for the Glock 9/40 or HK 9/40, and it is a double magazine holder with the roto feature. (allows you to tilt the holder and mags forward or back for faster reloads/better concealment. However the picture shown and product description is for the paddle version of this product, but this is the 6900RB, which is not a paddle version, but instead a belt version. The only difference is that it doesn't have a paddle that can be slid inside the pants to secure it over the top of the pants and belt, so to put it on, you must take your belt part of the way off and feed it through an opening on the back of the holder. The website accurately describes the product as a 6900RB, but they describe it and show a picture of the 6900RP."
2,Too Big,"I found that this holster sticks out pretty far from the body. If you're looking for easy concealment, this is not the best option."
1,The Classic Citroens,"As a new customer, unfortunately this book can only be read to page 12 or so after paying for it even. Amazon has been re-installed to see if that is the problem and the book has been downloaded again, (and on multiple devices) but it can't be read past a certain point, (9t stalls and you can't go forward or backwards) so from this point of view I have to list myself as a dissatisfied customer - who is not sure who to report this to in terms of a refund or whatever has to happen."
5,A DEFINITE SLEEPER,"This was the very first album I bought as a teenager at a neighborhood discount store. Little did I know how much I would love it. Aside from Want Ads and Stick Up, little was heard from this group after these hits. But this album showcases their talent. After the arrival of the CD, I regretably got rid of my vinyls, and letting this go was one of my biggest regrets. The one song I never got out of my head was Who's It Gonna Be, a haunting tale of a woman who forces her 2-timing man to make a choice because she can't take sharing him any longer. After 20+ years, I still remember how much I truly enjoyed this album..Don't Count Your Chickens, All The Kings Horses.... This is one of those rarities of buying an album (I'm dating myself) and finding one hit after another on it. I'm so excited to finally see it on CD. BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!!!!!"
3,Brother Jim,"The last album Milt made for Pablo (May 1985). Jimmy Heath and Harold Vick join him on the front line, playing tenor and soprano saxophones. Vick is passable on soprano, though he doesn't create much warmth on the horn; on SLEEVES both play soprano and Heath sounds uncomfortable. Milt is featured on three tracks, one totally alone (LULLABY OF THE LEAVES), which as is usually the case on solo performances finds Jackson all over the place; the restraint afforded by the rhythm section on his other features (ILL WIND and HOW HIGH THE MOON) is welcomed. Joe Pass shows up on one track (SUDDEN DEATH), with the horns sitting out. The playing on this CD is acceptable, but it's not an essential Jackson CD."
1,These are FAKES!!,"Don't be fooled. These are unlicensed fakes, using the trademarks illegally. The real ones include scabbards and are made of functional carbon steel, not stainless steel. There is a place for lower cost look-a-likes, but sell them for what they are. Defrauding people by lying about what you are selling is a crime. ""Forgotten Realms"" and ""Dizzt Do'Urden"" are trademarked names, falsely associating them with unlicensed products is blatant trademark infringement."
5,Touch of Healing,"Very interesting book- It all makes sense. Great information on a somewhat lost art of healing. Even in my embryonic stage of knowledge of Jin Shin Jystsu, I can see that it works, and cannot wait to read more-"
5,HANSON up close and personal!,"Great! I've only seen it once, but I loved it! I was at the Seattle concert, and now I can see and hear what it was really like. You can see how much they've changed since MoN, in a good way. A must see for any diehard Hanson fan! :)"
5,This book have 6 stars!!!,IMHO this is the best book on the subject today. It was written for Photoshop CS2 but you can use it with any other Photohsop version like CS3 and CS4.If you want to learn how to design digital wedding albums this is the book. Don't waiste your time and money on other books like I did.The author is a professional book writter that became a professional photographer so she knows the art or writting books from A to Z and this book is the proof.This is a six (6) stars book.
1,reality check time,"""These include giving every parent the right to a year's paid leave""-WHO is going to pay for this? And why should the childfree be discriminated against and have to pay into this as another tax-so they can work the year to help supplement the year of pay given to parents. In what world is this fair?"
3,Liquid Fence,I have only used this item a short time. I am not sure about it yet. When I received the package the top was loose and about 2 oz. were spilled and what a mess and smell.
1,HORRIBLE SMELL!,"I just used this product. And while I didn't expect it to smell nice, I have to say IT SMELLS HORRIBLE!It smells like a' mixture of rotting flesh and vomit, and that is no exaggeration.I mixed the concentrate in my garage, and had to use my leaf blower to evacuate the smell as it left my workspace unbearable.I hope the smell tapers off, because as of right now I don't want to even been in my own yard it smells so bad. If it does and works, then great, but my first impressions are that this product is hardly useable. It seems like someone took a bunch of horrid smells and tried to combine them until something worked. Is there any science involved here?Sorry neighbors - eek!"
1,pretty useless for me,"If you have a std onguard lock, then this might work for you. But if you have a thick lock like the pitbull. then this won't work for you."
1,Definitely too flimsy for the job,"Mine lasted six weeks, and simply snapped when putting the lock in. Be prepared to carry this in your pack or lash to the frame."
5,Beautiful,"VH1 (Inside) Out is great.Every Warren Zevon fan, and even if you are not a fan, will love it."
1,Obsolete product--no longer updated or supported.,"SystemSuite 4 is no longer supported or updated as of a couple months ago (sometime around October 2004.) If you want SystemSuite, don't buy this old version, get the latest one (at the time I write this it is version 5, but check www.v-com.com for the latest)"
2,Book misses the point,"I was very excited to read this book, to see the other side of the argument. The book raises some intriguing points about him, especially into the methods he uses to make his movies. However, the authors fall into the trap of politicizing their arguments and basically do the same stuff they fault Moore for. I do feel the title is in poor taste, especially since it was Franken and not Moore had started the tasteless phrase."
1,A bigger piece of poo does not exist in print!,"It's truly amazing how many people will stoop to saying whatever sensational things they can dream up to make money. MM has his faults and truly is self centered, but you have to love his liberalistic attitude, and his willingness to expose the truth. I got the book for free from someone that was unfortunate enough to pay for it: A politics professor that was going to present it to his class. After reading it, he of course gave it away, and he is a conservative. If you love sensationalism and are looking for fuel for your hate fire, this is great kindling!"
1,This book is nothing but redneck made up fiction,"This book sucks. Michael Moore is a genius. The authors of this book are nothing but disgusting, miserable George W. Bush supporting clowns. Watch them do a silly dance for a banana children. Oh, and this book is just evidence of how scared to death the Republicans are. Come November, they'll all be sorry."
1,"Sad, Sad, Sad","It was inevitable that with Michael Moores increasing success, someone would come along with an attempt to discredit him. There are many criticisms that can be levelled at Moore. Sadly, this book covers few of them. I don't expect this book to make any difference to his success. people who already dislike him and/or resent his success, will buy it to see their prejudices confirmed. All I can say is: I am glad I didn't have to spend money to read my copy."
4,Not too shabby.,"This is a very entertaining book. I'm tired of Michael Moore's propaganda masquerading as investigative journalism. David Hardy does a good job of toppling this media titan with some long overdue criticism.Wow. 230 1-star reviews for this book already posted on this website. As I have said on many occasions, these misguided hate-filled people need to find something constructive to do in their free time. It's so sad."
5,Good book,"It's difficult to write a good book on this subject because the authors are putting facts accurately as opposed to lying to make a good story. Nevertheless the authors do a good job exposing manipulations. And yes, Michael Moore does lie and manipulate facts; nobody non-communist should have any doubts especially after his recent promotion of health care in ... Cuba."
5,A must have for every home.,I really don't need to add much since most people here have said what I'd say. This is an excellent book that should be required reading. It's about time someone showed Michael Moore as the liar and manipulator he is. The man has lied about his own friends. Any man who lies about his friends is going to lie about people he hates. Moore is just a tinfoil hat away from joining the like of those like Nick Redfern of Three Men Seeking Monsters. (My apologises to those who where tinfoil hats.)
1,How Desperate Can You Get?,"Pathetic, poorly written, non-existent editing, overall just plain moronic content. Michael Moore may be overweight, and yes he is white (so what? is Hardy a racist?), but he isn't stupid, and he can always lose weight. Unfortunately it doesn't look as though Hardy can grow a brain at this late date, as he obviously couldn't think up much of a title without copying Moore.If you are a right wing uneducated extremist, this is the book for you to pat yourself on the back with. All others, avoid."
1,Baseless and published for attention!,"Trust these words from a former die-hard Republican - This book is a publicity stunt and published only for attention and out of anger...not truth.Democrat, Republican, Independant...it does not matter.The administration I voted for has lied, misled, bullied, manipulated, terrified and destroyed America.The Democrats are lucky to have Mr. Moore.We Republicans, who do we have? Anne Coulter? Oh...hooray. Another loud mouth, opinionated lawyer with no real grasp of the reality Americans are living everyday.I don't care whether you like or hate Michael Moore. This book is a waste of your dollars...period!"
1,HA HA HA!,There's a lot of people scared of Michael Moore and will do anything to discredit him. His detractors can't dispute all the facts he presented so they had to resort to character asassination. So pathetic really.
4,Informative,"I was suprised by the information I found in this book. As a person who watched Bowling for Columbine and Farenheit 9/11, and allowed it to make me see the ""truth"" differently, I was embaressed to learn the lies Michael Moore has told.Many people say Michael Moore has done this country a great service by bringing the ""truth"" to the public, but when confronted with his lies, retract and say at least he makes people think. But lies are lies, and spreading fallacies about out nations leaders is a huge disservice to the country.I found this book informative, my advice......watch the movies, read the books put out by Michael Moore- then pick up this book and use the facts to make up your mind."
5,I would give 5 stars just for the title! :),"I totally agree that Michael Moore is a big fat stupid white man! Unfortunately, there are many people out there that believe the garbage coming out of his mouth. It is up to us, the right minded people in America, to keep on speaking the truth about hateful extremists like Michael Moore, and tons of other liberals like Susan Sarandon, Barbra Streisand, Sean Penn, George Clooney, Ben Afleck, Sheryl Crow, Bruce Springsteen and so on.....Anyway, good job David Hardy on this well written book."
3,Our polemic is better than your polemic!,"First let me qualify this by saying that I do not like Michael Moore. I admire him as one of the greatest propagandists to ply the art, but his is still just a propagandist. His work is deceptive, selectively edited, and built solely to support his world-view and to feed his ego.Aside from my personal feelings, I found this book to be a little wanting. In exposing Michael Moore, Hardy & Clarke tend to use the same rhetorical tactics which Moore himself uses. The way the book is structured leads me to wonder if it wasn't meant as a backhanded compliment to Moore's own writing style. All that aside, I really did enjoy this book. It's fun to read. Just like it's fun to eat too much chocolate, or to watch your personal foes get hung out to dry. I think the authors have done a good job over all, but there is definite room for improvement."
5,Balances out the lies of Moore,"I will admit F911 is a great piece of film work. Unfortunatly, it is filled with lies. This book attempts to expain what is behind Moore's need to distort the facts to further a radical political agenda. Don't get me wrong, the right is guilty of this with it's many radio talk hosts. The problem is that Moore is a danger to the United States."
2,"Oped, little else!","This reads like a ""patched together in a hurry"" collection of highly opinionated editorials by writers with right wing agendas and basically little or no actual research. Hate for Moore is the main theme, so it takes away any reliable credibility. At least Moore's books and movies have humor in their obviousness to allow one not to take things so seriously. These ""articles"" read like angry ideologues venting hate and venom for no other reason than they can. No self-respecting newspaper or magazine would publish this stuff so most if not all is probably gleened from the web, which we all know is oh so accurate all the time.It is quick reading, poor writing and for the most part irrelevant except to strike a blow at Moore, who I suspect is laughing his you know what off at the immaturity of it all."
3,On par,"Well written as an opposition to what's his face...""Michael Moore"". While masquerading as documentaries, his books are anything but. It is not exactly the greatest book, but Michael Moore doesn't exactly rate the greatest book being written about him."
1,Let's Be Grownup,"I'm staunch conservative Republican but let's face it; the Bush presidency was ill gotten and has proved to be extremely harmful to our republic. The fact that Moore presents issues in a less than text-book documentary way does not lessen the fact that he is bringing the dirty truth about our current administration to masses (i.e., the Americamn people). Moore should be applauded for this."
1,Parlour Game,"Only for those who want to believe that this guy is not ""right on."" Try this...take any of Moore's books and substitute the following words ""Reagan"" ""Bush"" or ""W"" - for Clinton. Then read it for the rrw (right wing wackos) - they will agree with everything...then watch when you prove the sentiments were about Republicans! Better than throwing p-nuts to zoo animals!"
1,Plain and simple,"Bush is unfit for presidency(Fahrenheit exhibits this thoroughly) and he's done a lot of damage to this country. This book is an example of quick cheap money, unbacked by thorough research and is a total waste of time. One question: How can a complete and utter retard be regarded as a fit leader for the strongest nation in the world? Wake up America."
1,Why isn't anyone on the right funny?,"Say what you want about Michael Moore, but at least he's funny. This book can barely conceal its anger and is about as funny or insightful as a Pauly Shore monologue written by William Safire."
5,Michael Moore really is a big fat stupid white man.,"Cmon, Face it, the title alone brings out the truth in the book. Michael Moore is a man who hates America, and now he's fueling the fire of the Trendy Democrats across the globe. Cmon, you democrats have no voices for yourselves, you are just controlled by the media. This book is good one to throw at any whiny democrat or liberal. Truthfully, I rather have a strong, powerful leader like George Bush instead of a ass kisser like John Kerry."
3,Slightly in Favor of the Right,"Clearly, in reading through the reviews and looking at the ratings, this book has split the reviewers along partisan lines. Leftists give the book ""1 star"" and the right-wingers give the book ""5 stars"". Average rating at the point I am writing this review stands at ""3-1/2 stars"" -- go figure.In any case, this book succeeds in what it has set out to do -- make us think about what we are being fed. Careful omission of facts from most authors and media spin artists can make any argument seem plausible. Enjoy the book with a grain of salt!"
5,Just the facts mam.,"This book is an excellent read for everyone. It does an great job of documenting the history of Moore's lies and distortions. One of the funny things in the book is that they are able to predict the wacko conspiracy theories in Farce 911 before it was released. The authors use facts and site their sources all throughout the book. The Mooreons that are trashing this book without reading it need to read this book most of all. Hey I watched Moore's crockumentary. Can they say they read this enlightening book? I'm sure they can't, because they prefer to live in their narcissistic dream land."
5,blood money,"if the quote from Moore (about how those who chop heads off as being the new minutemen and how it would be good for the blood of Americans to flow so we can be forgiven for rescuing Iraqis from the torture and rape and genocide that was the monstrous dictator Saddam Hussein's regime) doesn't convince you that Moore is just out for blood money and bloody fame, then this book WILL if you read it,.... the facts are all there ... Moore is a traitor and a bloody baffoon who has no soul apparently, Moore is the embodiment of doublethink where lies are truth, and truth are lies .... Thank you so much Mr. Hardy, and Mr. Clarke, for shining the real truth for all to see."
1,Interesting insight into Right-Wing hysteria...,"I'm no great fan of Michael Moore's. However, I think he's brought up some points that all Americans should ponder.I just love that the Right-Wingers are so freaked out by the onslaught of anti-Bush writings that they stoop to writing a scathing book about a regular old fat guy with a marginally independent thought process.If you don't like him, don't see his films or read his political commentaries. End of problem."
5,Handy,"Handy and sturdy. It's very useful for lifting, pushing and pulling lots of hot things, both outside at the grill and inside at the range/oven, toaster-oven, or microwave. Has a good grip too."
4,The Amazing Jimmy Rowles,"This LP highlights what made Rowles such a genius. I recall Whitney Balliett calling him the Lewis Carroll of the paino, or something similar. His phrasing and ability to inject hunour in his playing was what made him the choice of so many musicians-the album he did with Zoot of Lady Day is astounding. In any case, I digress. Lilac Time has some simply beautiful moments-The Theme from Arrest and Trial is an untold gem, and one that only Rowles would have known about-pure poetry, and am surprised it has not been done by others. He reworks Night in Tunisia magificently, vocalises sweetly on Ella and Buddy Johnson's I Wonder Where Our Love has Gone, comes up with a sweet number in Belfast, and his playing throughout is vintage Rowles. If you wantto understand jazz piano, listen and get to know Jimmy Rowles-that's where it's at."
4,Crowder-ish,"Very cool CD. Totally a Worship CD, as all of DCB's are. DCB Makes you rethink worship, not all worship bands make you do that, but I guess the most important thing is that bands worry about worship, for it to be just Worship to our Lord and not worship to the band itself. Loved it."
4,good,"i am a catholic who generally sticks to secular music, finding christian music to generally be a souless carbon copy of more original secular bands. i'm tired of hearing about the christian limp bizkit, and the christian snoop dogg or whatever. im waiting for a good bunch of christians to get together and make something interesting. this album shows some promise, the songs are diverse, and sometimes EVEN SUBTLE, something that is largely absent from christian music. i was of course upset on reading the endless references to the dave matthews band in the other reviews of this album and so i felt i needed to write my own. its a good album. it stands on its own. i couldnt find even a ghost of dmb anywhere on the album. i think the references to dmb must just be because crowder named the band after himself. thats all i could come up with."
3,"Great voice, songs okay",I think her voice is wonderful but did not particularly enjoy the songs. They seemed to sound the same after the first few.
4,Canadian Classic,In Ontario when we think of Mary Cook we think of Liar Liar. We have all heard her tell these stories in person. These are great fun stories from a great personality and a great author.
3,ONLY ONE EPISODE!,"This is truly an amazing show, and I was very excited when I thought I bought an entire season, but this dvd is only 47 minutes, containing a single episode...A very good episode, but that's still pretty low! 8("
5,"Passionate, Compassionate Military History","In this time of war, I found this book to be important because #1, it seemed like the first down-in-the-weeds view of the Gulf War and #2, it immediately struck a curious, human tone in dealing with inhuman events. While I understand that some feel this book to be biased towards Marines, I thought that it presented a balanced view of the modern American fighting man--his colossal screw ups, his foibles, his prejudices, in short, his humanity--themes that seems all the more important considering the ongoing Iraq War. THe book is full of strange stuff--Marines trying to kill their own officers, horrific friendly fire, American Marines converting to Islam, Jewish-Americans serving under Saudi officers, etc. This book seemed to be a larger, broader version of JARHEAD--an alternate view of the Marines Corps and the Gulf War."
4,"A virtually unknown battle, until now.","This is a very exciting account about a much forgotten battle. I found it very engrossing and hard to put down. It does a great job at conveying the chaos and devastating lethality of modern combat.Also recommend:""Thunder Run: The Armored Strike to Capture Baghdad""""The March Up: Taking Baghdad With The 1st Marine Division"""
1,A good title for this book,"You may feel baited and switched if you buy and read this book about Barb Ehrenreich's perfunctory attempt to find a job. It's not just the fact that the young woman on the cover is definitely not the much, much older Barbara Ehrenreich.I read the book and wondered what her point was. It's hard to find a job? She is perplexed by the odd rituals of job hunting, rituals that include such exotic tasks as preparing a resume, writing cover letters, and interviewing for jobs.There were so many times when I wanted to hug her and say, Barbara, it's not YOU. It's not your tacky tote bag that's holding you back. It's hard to find a job. Because she does her job search in total isolation, she has no feedback, no consolation, unless you count her career coaches.Where does all of her anger originate? She is defensive beyond belief."
3,"Eh, not up to the standard...","I read the reviews of this book before I bought it but I loved Nickel and Dimed so much that I got it anyway. I do have to agree that it isn't really in any way about ""working"" in white collar office jobs, but is simply about meeting with career counselors and coaches, and attending job seminars in search of a powerful PR job. After the fifth or so meeting with career coaches telling her how to sell herself, I got quite bored. I enjoyed the part where she met with the AFLAC recruiter. I wish the book had contained more interaction with (potential) employers. That was the interesting part of her previous book."
3,A bit of a letdown,"Don't get me wrong: The book was good and I enjoyed it. It just didn't have quite impact of ""Nickeled and Dimed"" and was a bit bland. She never actually gets a real job here and that becomes the moral of the story. There's some good messages and things, it's just not as substantial as NaD. I'd still check it out though: Barbara Ehrenreich is a good writer."
1,A waste of time...,"I'm 1/2 way through and it's hard to keep going - I've been skimming the last 30 pages or so. While the premise is interesting, the details bog down into boredom. So far all she's done is visited numerous worthless career coaches and attended numerous worthless ""networking"" meetings & seminars that usually don't involve any networking. Many of these are church-affiliated, so she spends time mocking christian views on the job-seeking.The main issue I have is: it's possible for any job-seeker to endlessly spin their wheels in these ways and reading about it is just not very interesting. It does give a sense of the daunting task job hunting can be for professionals, but there are better books on the subject out there."
1,THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE!,"not only was this book depressing, it was mainly a log of the process of looking for a job when you are old and only slightly experienced. it is perfectly useless and completely awful."
2,Reread Nickel and Dimed and skip this sleeper,After reading Nickel and Dimed I was intrigured to read on about Ehrenreich's take on corporate america. What this book does instead is explain what a pain it is to a get a job in white collar america with only a bachelors degree. The entire book goes on and on about how unsuccessful resume coaches/writers and paid/free networking events are when it comes to getting a job. No kidding. This book is nothing short of an F quality sequel to a successful #1 seller. This book will do nothing for you other than waste your $24.00. If you do want to torture yourself at least save yourself the money and check this sleeper out at the library. A better use of your time would be to reread Nickel and Dimed.
1,merely scorn and contempt.,"If you're looking for some inspiration, look elsewhere. It's not self-help and it's not an expose on any aspect of job hunting. This book will make the unemployed white collar worker consider suicide. The author can barely contain her contempt for business, business people, and, well, anyone who isn't her."
2,disappointed,"I enjoyed Nickel and Dimed so much, I was excited to read Bait and Switch. I was sorely disappointed. If you haven't read Nickel and Dimed, you should. However, I would not recommend Bait and Switch."
1,on-track better and easier to use than systemworks,"i had systemworks previously but decide to buy systemsuite after reading a revieuw article in pc magazine-it is easier to use,works well and you also get more tools for your money-but you should be selling version 5 now it just camme out"
1,DO NOT HONORED THE PRICE AT AMAZON WEB,"AT AMERICAN PEARL WEBSITE THEY HAD AN EXPENSIVE PRICE FOR THIS RING, TRY TO BUY IT BUT THROUGH AMAZON BUT WHEN SEND A QUESTION THEY CHANGE THE PRICE ON AMAZON WEB AND THEN NEVER ANSWER MY EMAILS. I'NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER AT ALL!!!!"
1,CHEAP CHEAP- STICK WITH CARTERS BRAND,BEWARE:1- These are very thin poor quality2- They are NOT true to size. The 24 month is like buying 12 month size3- The arm holes are not very big.
2,SMALL,These run super small. My son can wear 3 month carters but in the gerber he is in 12 month. That's how small they run!
3,smaller than it looks,"the product will probably fit a preemie or your baby for 1-3 wks, not for 0-3 months."
2,More limited than I expected,"This card is less useful than I had hoped. It does one thing fairly well and that is give you directions from one point to another, assuming it chooses a reasonable route (a common problem with similar products). However, the memory size limits how many roads it shows. Points of Interest are limited and hotel/food information is only by interstate exits. And the direction finder sometimes crashes the Palm.To sum it up, it's useful, but limited, and not a good value."
4,Nickelodeon Episodes,This is not a stand alone movie. This is a compilation of several Nickelodeon episodes (including the titular zombie show) that have scary or spooky themes.
1,my ears are bleeding,"One star is generous. The only good thing about this recording is that Cullum's butchering of Lover, You Should've Come Over might be enough to rouse Jeff Buckley from death so he can put a stop to it. His rendition of Radiohead's High and Dry left deep ruts in my eardrums that have yet to stop bleeding. Sometimes an artist can take a song and make it his own, but in this case, I suggest sticking to the real thing."
2,When I am Emperor,"Imperial Decree #3,744: no-one shall be permitted to sing Cole Porter until they have reached the age of thirty-five.I believe no further explanation is necessary.My innate benevolence stands in the way of my offering a candid appraisal of the youngster's Chet Baker ""aspirations"".Best he stick with the Radiohead, as I am certain Thom Yorke appreciates the royalties.I thank you for your attention.You are dismissed."
5,Why the need for labels,"I spend alot of time reading reviews before buying and I shop alot on this site this is the first time I feel compelled to share and ask.....folks why can't we just let go of the need for labels.... I could not care less if this cd should be called Jazz or Pop I couldn't careless if his cover was better than the orginal or not. What I know I care about is how I feel when I put it on and its so rare for me to put a cd on and not feel the need to skip cuz the next is going to be just as good. Sure I love Vaughn, Holiday, Sinatra, Elton and Radiohead and all the others we attempt to measure Jamie against but Jamie is just Jamie and I like it quite fine. I think you will find him quite special."
1,Would the REAL Ben Folds please stand up!,"It's unbelieveable to me that this high school musical, pop- jazz-ISH record is getting the hype that it seems to be. With the plausible exception of the co-written ""All At Sea"", basically this is a covers disc with a couple ""original"" ballads thrown in. And the choice of covers would make their original performers and/or writers roll in thier respective graves.It would appear this guy is most talented at pulling the wool over radio programmers eyes with his embarrassing stage high jinx. If y'all think Kenny G is jazz and Justin Timberlake is pop...then this is for you!"
2,Maybe he's better live?,"With all the hype, bought the cd and was a little disappointed. His voice is not one of a classic crooner like a Michael Buble or Tony Bennet.Jamie does have some appeal however with the different sound of his voice. Track 2 and 5 sounded best."
2,Nothing fascinating...,"I wasn't really satisfied, to be honest. People seem to be attracted to the smooth jazz background and unique singing voice that Jamie has, but some of the selections...Granted, the tracks are well played, but ""Singin' In The Rain""? It seems like a joke. And his originals aren't much out of the ""look what i can do"" range. Call me ignorant, but it's just not up to par with some of the greater musical talents that are offerec today. There's nothing overly fascinating here that you couldn't get from any of today's other alt-pop chart toppers. Keep working on that...music thing, Jamie."
4,Interesting,"Interesting artist. Interesting album. OK, here's the deal: You add in some Elvis Costello, then you add in some Joe Jackson and finally add in some Billie Joel. Voila. WHat'd ya got. Jamie Cullum. Check it out. Tell me I'm wrong."
4,HAVE YOU READ THIS BOOK? NO? REEEEAAAADDDD IT!,"This book is wonderful! I think that it has a terrific moral and that everyone who likes adventure should READ it! I truly would rate this book a 4 1/2, beacause I love it, but it is not as good as some of the books I've read. Everyone: read and learn!"
5,The kids will beg to keep reading!,"This delightful tale set in Ancient China during the Tang Dynasty depicts the story of a young prince setting out for his first journey into the world. He embarks with a cache of oddly plain gifts destined to convince the leader of a supposed utopian kingdom to reveal his secrets for success. Along the way, the prince faces various hardships that challenge his strength and unveil a greater person inside than he knew existed. Hilarious humor and sarcasm are interspersed throughout the captivating dialogues. My kids would never let me put it down without an appeal for ""just one more chapter - pppppplllllleeeeeeeeaaase!"""
3,So Much Potential...,"I thought the latest release would have addressed the critical design faults in previous versions, but they remain; the design of the software is so complicated that it burdens even a configuration which can handle almost anything I throw at it.I can certainly see the potential for TMG to be vastly superior to any other product in the genre, but at the end of the day, I will always favour a succinct and unencumbered design.Configuration: version 5.11; Windows XP; P4 2.6GHz; 1GB RAM."
2,Not worth buying!,"This book does not deliver any new ideas or hints on how to entertain. What I find very disappointing is the book's styling; most photos are black and white, small and not very good. You can't even see the decoration suggestions very well and to me they look very loveless. All in all the book looks very old-fashioned in a kind of nineteen-sixties look - but not in a nice retro way... Another negative point is that there are just a few recipes - and they are not very original. The only good thing in the book is the resource guide in the back."
1,Connectors broke on first use,"The connectors broke on first use, rendering this almost completely unusable. Now I have to wedge the connector in between two heavy objects just so the connection is made and can hold a charge. Stick with the crade if you can find one..."
3,awkward fit,"I've had this for less than a month, and already one of the 2 metal contacts has broken off. I bought the cable after reading the reviews on the cradle, which said it was awkward to fit the Palm into the cradle and that the cable would work better. I find the cable fit is tenuous at best (even with both contacts), and the fact that I'm already going to have to get a new one (or a cradle instead) is not a good sign."
5,THE GREATEST BOOK EVER,"With Fire and Sword brings back the glory, triumph and spendor of Poland - once the ""savior of Europe,"" - which is now looked down upon by many people. Sienkiewicz paints an intimate, entertaining, funny, sad, and searing portrait of a nation in the throes of civil war. His characters are memorable and unfortgettable. Yan Skshetuski,Pan Zagloba, Michal Volodyovsky, Prince Yeremi, and Longinus Podbipyenta will always be part of you. Sienkiewicz mixes action, comedy, and melancholia to make a truly great novel"
3,Job well done BUT not for me....,"A good album if you're into progressive style trance tracks but that's not what I'm in to. Having the BK name on it I was expecting hard thumping beats but thats not what you'll find on this album. True this does prove that theres more to BK than hard house. If you're looking for classic BK, UK hardhouse tracks then this isn't for you. On the other hand if you're into trance and/or progressive stuff you'd want to pick this up. BK is a great dj/producer after all and this album proves that he's also versatile."
3,Clive Barker's - Nightbreed,"I'd seen this movie when it first came out back in 1990, before I was in high school. Since then, I've developed an interest in books, and some of my favorite authors are Stephen King, Dean Koontz, and Clive Barker.I'd recently read Clive Barker's Cabal, the story in which Nightbreed is based on, and decided to watch this movie again and see how close it came to the book.As far as the movie goes, it's not that bad, pretty good actually, and it's fairly close to the book. I personally like Hellraiser (both the book-The Hellbound Heart-and the movies) better than Nightbreed, but if you're a Barker fan, or a fan of horror in general, I don't think that you'll be disappointed in this flick."
3,"Great movie, horrible DVD","This movie is absolutely worth seeking out, even when actual effort is required to find it, as it seems to now be out of print. The DVD treatment is awful with zero extras, old school cardboard snap case and less than stellar mastering... but it's almost certainly the only edition of it we're ever going to get. Clive Barker's best work as a filmmaker by far, and quite possibly the best film adaptation of one of his works, even if the lead actor Craig Schaeffer is pretty horrid."
3,Imaginative horror...,"An exceptional follow up to 'Hellraiser', Clive Barkers 'Nightbreed' is an entertaing horror yarn with some impressive FX. The storylines pretty good, but the film seems almost too short. I was surprised by David Croneberg's performance (I persoanlly feel he's a better actor than he is a director). The ending leaves doors, wide-open, for a potential sequel, infact 'Nightbreed' deserves a sequel. Watch out for Craig Sheffer who appears in the latest 'Hellraiser' film, 'Hellraiser: Inferno'. Which also stars Doug (Pinhead) Bradley, who co-incidently starred in this too."
2,Lee Aaron = Pat Benatar Wannabe,"Bleh.This album was loaned to me by a friend who said that I, as a longtime headbanger and goth rocker, just had to check it out. So i borrowed it, spun it... and shut it off halfway through.I fail to understand the whole paradigm driving Lee's work. A Canadian with a voice like a country singer belting out heavy metal songs about Texas outlaws? This makes no sense. Her voice is beautiful, but lacks real passion, snarl or heavy metal fire. The band is not much better: strictly formulaic 80s pop metal, with predictable song structures and vanilla lead guitar riffs.I used to wonder what would happen if Pat Benatar hooked up with a real heavy metal band & let it rip. If this is the answer, forget I asked the question.I hope Lee's subsequent albums were better. Much better.Bleh."
2,Lousy.,"In general I'm a big fan of movie music, but to tell the truth I expected more from this one. This soundtrack is incomaparable to say Lord of the Rings or Star Wars movie music. It lacks depth and emotion and power. Unlike emotionally potent melodies present in LOTR soundtrack the Eragon is pretty dull and uninteresting. I get the impression that the entire album is in fact a variation of a single theme called Eragon. I get the feeling that entire album has only one very long and boring track. I hope they'll make better album for the next movie of the Inheritence Trilogy."
1,Very uncomfortable headset,"I had high hopes for this headset. However, it is a VERY uncomfortable headset. Good sound quality, but I had to returned it."
5,Best everyday carry for the money,"I have the medium and large versions of this knife. The medium is perfect and is my preferred EDC. The large is good but somewhat stiffer to open and close. Get the medium and you will never know it is in your pocket. Also, both of these knives came razor sharp and have retained their edges well."
5,good knife,i use this for work stays sharp. the locking mechanism broke but buck fix it no problem. don't put to fine of an edge or it will chip.
1,Very bad quality !,"I used it for maybe 10 or 15 times and air compressor is dead.I bought it while I was in US and install it on my new VW Golf V (in Europe- I'm seaman ) , I spend few hours to install , and now I have to spend one more hour to dismantel it, and trow it in nearest garbage bin ."
4,Solid book.,"Some details are left out...and some fighters names are misspelled. But, overall the book gives solid bios for many great fighters. More detail should have been paid to Olympics boxing coverage though..."
3,technology alone doesn't save a game,"Yes, this game does have good graphics. It also has loads of technology up on Civ II. However, technology doesn't always make a game better or more fun to play. Let's face it, if that were the case there wouldn't be people scouring the internet for copies of King's Quest 1.This was my first experience with the Civ games, and I didn't like it. There were too many military units, and it seemed by the time you finally finished building one it was obsolete. Also, the caravans were, well, annoying. You had to build dozens of these little caravans to trade amongst your own civ!!! Civ III addressed this problem by only having to build roads around your civ (so much simpler.)While Civ III IS still new and fairly expensive, I would tell people to buy it instead. Or if they couldn't afford it, I'd tell them to get Civ II. A Civ game just isn't a (good) Civ game without Sid Meier."
2,"Go for Civ III, instead","This game was not made by the creator of Civilization, Sid Meier, and it shows. The AI is shoddy, the interface isn't what it should be, and the game just doesn't feel like Civilization. For me, the worst part is the map generator. It's always putting continent-sized swamps and mountains everywhere, so that half the map is uninhabitable. It just doesn't feel like you're playing on a real world. Plus, you can't use pre-generated maps (at least, not easily).....In addition to all that, the units will drive you crazy. All of the ""special units"" are only visible to certain otherunits. So if you want to defend against slavers, or spies, or televangelists, etc, you need to have a different anti-special unit for each of them in each of your cities. Ugghhh!Before Civ III came out, I would get this to tide me over until it was released. But now that Civ III is out, don't even bother. Just get Civ III, you'll be much happier, believe me..."
1,Why aren't there cards made for Zire palms?,I want and need cards for my Zire 21 palm. I need a Dictionary/Thesaurus card and one of these translator cards. Anyone who knows where I can find 1 please tell me by e-mailing at americanidol111@yahoo.com
5,Excel made easy...,"This book not only took the mystery out of spreadsheets, but made me a spreadsheet junkie. I keep it by my desk for reference. A definite for people who want a quick start into the world of spreadsheets."
3,Terry Stafford it Ain't,"I bought this CD because of the cover ofthe Terry Stafford song, Amarillo by Morning.I have to say that Jansky's voice just soundstoo low for the part. I much prefer Stafford'soriginal recording.If you like religious music, then perhaps thisalbum has some appeal. Otherwise, George Straitoffers a more faithful rendition of the original song."
5,Marie,I bought this devotional for my 5 year old daughter. We both love it. I would highly recommend it for young girls.
2,Not enough,"This devotion book just doesn't have enough to it - the devotions are too short, there's not enough meat to it. My 7 year old is bored by it. Keys for Kids, a devotional magazine, is more to her liking."
5,Our Father,"As the other reviewer, I learned The Lord's Prayer when I was old enough to talk but I never understood it. Praying the Lord's Prayer for Spiritual Breakthrough truly opened my eyes. I always wondered why we prayed at night...""Give us this day our daily bread"" when we were about to sleep. This book will truly give you a true understanding of asking God to guide your steps throughout the day as you by communicating with God through The Lord's Prayer."
2,"Works good, after a while, then BOOM.","I got this one a while ago. First time it didn't flash the firmware correctly. Got the unit replaced. Then find out it had the wrong firmware TO BEGIN WITH. Get the correct firmware, ran like a charm. Then all of a sudden it just stopped working. This is only after about four months of use."
2,We'll never know if it would have worked,"Maybe this product is terrific at what it does, once configured. My experience with Belkin tech support, the documentation, and the firmware was very, very bad. After 24 hours of frustration, I finally returned the WAP. Then I spent an hour recovering my original configuration.Note that if you are trying to use this device as a range extender, you will probably be interested in the Super Secret ""range extender quick start guide"" on the Belkin support web site. It's not included in the box.My impression is that engineering designed a good product, tested it in very narrow circumstances, then told the tech writers what to write down. Clearly no one tested the documentation."
5,let us dance and dance !!!,"David M. and Albert C. as Moca give us a teaste of what I call a real disco-house music. This is a type of music I want to hear in clubs. Absolutely perfect for dancing and mixing, with a characteristic for this kind of music beat. propably the best dancing piece this year (so far)"
1,Far too easy on mass-murderer Saddam Hussein is this author,"During Saddam's dreaded Anfal Campaign the Iraqi dictator murdered 182,000 Iraqi Kurds in just one year. This gets no mention or hint from this Christian clergyman-author. Also, Meyers gives the UN sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War of 1991 a thumbs up like they helped really keep Saddam in check. Actually, Hussein starved thousands of Iraqi Kurds to death by manipulating these very sanctions.On other matters the author claims that acts of homosexuality are not condemned by the Holy Bible except as being things like idolatry-type practices. There are several Bible quotes from the author discussing the subject of homosexuality but he predictably left out Romans 1:21-27 which calls both homosexualty by men and lesbian practices by women unnatural!"
3,Like Dante's Inferno,"Disconcerting and jarring, The Curse of Mesphisto's Seed by William P. Haynes is a masterful story. The characters of good and evil play a game of cat and mouse as redemption is found, then is lost again. The Curse of Mesphisto's Seed draws you into a complex world that twists and turns and compels the reader to remember your religious dogma taught at every Sunday school class.The story is written from a detatched point of view which I found unsettling. Several times, I had to let previous chapters digest before reading more about the Devil, Mesphisto, his spawn Elliott Stevens, and God and His angel representative, Mark Talbot. I found it disturbing and profound, but maddening to read.I rate The Curse of Mesphisto's Seed 3 stars for William P. Haynes efforts. This is a book to be read with one hand on the Bible, reading Revelations and the other hand, caressing a religious symbol of faith."
3,DO YOU REALLY NEED IT?,"So is this really worth the money for the elusive 'B' sides? The jury is hung. Part of me wants it simply because it has HOLE stamped on it, then again for this price you can pick up a ""hole"" lot more music. Buy it if you're mad on Courtney, otherwise there are better CDs elsewhere."
5,Have comfort will travel,"This is one of the greatest investments I've ever made. This baby isn't just for enjoying a drink on the beach while soaking up rays (although it's a marvelous tool for that pursuit). I've used it to camp, to accomodate one more of my teenage sons' friends when cots, air mattresses & beds are at a minimum, and everyone fights for this hammock. It's portable, lightweight, packs up quick and easy, and I don't know how I survived before it arrived on my doorstep. Awesome product!"
5,Awesome--Fantastic,"Even though I am not a member of the six nations but am Cherokee, I found this book to be very uplifting. Reading it in English is one thing but seeing it printed in a native tongue makes it all the better. The native words emit waves of feelings from worlds that have gone before. It puts into words what we as a people need to listen to and take to heart and practice in our daily lives."
2,Public Domain Popeye,"Widely available in the public domain, this 1954-57 collection shows the spinach-packing sailor at his most formulaic. The latter-day Popeye cartoons produced by Famous Studios lack the spontaneity and freewheeling humor of the Max Fleischer shorts. ""Popeye's 20th Anniversary"" emerges as a typical Famous cheater while ""Floor Flusher"" and ""Spooky Swabs"" (the final theatrical release) are passable at best. However, the Soaky toy commercial is a nice touch."
1,what IS it?,What's the point of buying this kit on-line if you can't even tell what's in it? I wish they at least had a list of the stuff included.
3,Too much production ruins it,"I applaud this band and love a lot of their chops, writing and ethos. This could've been one of the best albums of the year. Their arrangements kick, but they've tried to gimmick every single song with too much reverb and 60's echo that often ruin what could be a straightforward garage rave. This works on a few -- ""Sleepwalking"" ""Ode to LA"" and ""Love in a Trash Can"" to name them. On others it smothers the tune and by the end of the album you're massaging a headache trying to find the song through the effects. It's definitely worth a listen, but you have to cherry-pick. I hope they mix it up better next album because they've got a strong and unique vibe."
3,Debut From A 20-year-old Rockstar-to-be,"It is unmistakably Bryan even when you listen to this with title and artist name undisclosed. Before the debut in 1979 he had been a songwriter so the album as a whole sounds as if Bryan were impersonating someone else's singing styles. Win Some And Lose Some and State of Mind are Rod Stewart styled tracks. With a little more luck, Give Me Your Love and Don't Ya Say It might have been used for major artists such as Bee Gees or Earth Wind and Fire. Wasting Time and Remember are surely close to some of Reckless tracks. While he shows his brilliant songwriting skill in this one, the vocal arrangement doesn't go well with instrumental parts. By the time ""Cuts Like A Knife"" had been released, however, he seemed to have acquired the technique to conquer such incompatibility. Such minor faults apart, you can really enjoy this upbeat album.Essential for Bryan Adams fans and debut album collectors."
1,For beginners only guys,"It's not for Experienced Programmers. If you are a VB programmer then this is a good book for you but if you are working with C, C++ or Java then get another one like Professional C# or C# and the .NET Platform."
5,The Best,"This is absolutely the best Zucchini cookbook available. There are so many wonderful recipes that cater to all dishes - Appetizers, Dinners & Desserts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has too much Zucchini and not enough ideas. After getting your hands on this book, you will find that ""Zucchini : You Can Never Have Enough""."
4,Good Enough for the price,"The items I REALLY wanted doesn't exist anymore/yet.This is good enough.I really can't complain, for a $50 item.Yes, when the battery runs low, the memory of where/which track you were on after shut-down gets fussy. But, I haven't noticed anything else worth whining about."
1,Poor Quality- made us mad!,"I just bought it new! But this DVD stopped working at the ""Moon Festival"" episode. The quality of this product is bad/ poor. My kid is loving this DVD, but she is mad that she can't watch the whole story."
1,sexist,I dislike girls where is mine also this is very sexist hopefully no one will buy it but who knows
1,"Don't let the fake French name fool you, it's a piece of junk","I bought this item because I really liked the way it looked and it seemed to hold a lot of dressing. After about the 1st or 2nd washing, the plastic gasket slipped off the neck of the stopper. It now continues to move all over the stopper, and prevents the stopper from snugly fitting into the bottle. The gasket is just a tad too big and too loose for the stopper. It doesn't take an engineer to figure out what's wrong. They have a defective product, and decided to release it for sale anyway, rather than fix the problem."
5,Hope this guy stays around?,"What's lacking in today's country music is style and originality. If you purchase this CD, you will not only get these two things, but much, much more. Keith Harling has yet again put heartfelt emotion into all of his songs. His previous label released him because of poor sales. Fortunately, Giant Records realized his talent which allowed Keith to put out another great CD. Let's just hope country listeners appreciate his music as much as it should be. If you want to listen to a country artist who truly deserves to last in this business, it's this guy right here. Buy it!"
1,Can do much better.,"Sorry Keith,your first album blew me away,I was that impressed, that I didn't even listen to your follow up;Bring it on,and I just went ahead and purchased it.This cd is nothing like the first;Write it in stone.You have great potential and I hope that in the future we will hear more of the quality and effort,like you put into your first cd,I'm sorry to inform you I regret bying;Bring it on,however I will be watching and awaiting your next release with great anticipation."
4,Real Indian head nickel?,"I'm not sure if the nickel is a real Indian head nickel. The action on the clip is good, however."
4,Kewl,"I love all of it except the joystick, but that wasnt a real problem. everything about it is excellent. The speakers really blast the game and the screen magnifier really helps."
5,"Fun, Factual, and Fascinating",Mr. Stanford has written yet another fascinating and gripping book about human origins and primate behavior that is easy for the lay person to read and understand.
3,Significant Others: The Ape-Human Continuum and the Quest for Human Nature,"While the author has many axes to grind-not all related to the subject, the book is worth reading."
5,A good book by a man with a passion for the subject,"Loren Coleman is a writer who believes what he writes, and has spent a life time in persuit of the the truth of bigfoot. I found the book to be well written and informative. It was not a white wash of the subject either. There was enough skeptical information presented in this book to make even hard core believers think hard before accepting rumors and stories as true. The book gave information on various bigfoot like creatures that don't fit the common bigfoot mold, without becoming disjointed. It's a very interesting subject that will never be fully settled until a bigfoot, alive of dead is found and studied"
2,Where's the beef?,"I wonder about all the reviewers who gave the book five stars. Have they ever read a great novel, one that would truly merit five stars? Are they friends of the author? I considered giving this book one star just to lower the average customer rating to a more appropriate level.The reason I did not is that the book had one positive attribute: it was funny. I must admit, there were times that I laughed out loud.On the other hand, the plot was amateurish and predictable, character development was poor, and the sarcasm often became tiresome.My overall impression of the book is that, like diet cola, it has plenty of flavor but very little substance."
2,Disappointing,"Can't believe all the five star reviews this one got! Was VERY misled by the raves on this site! Agree wholeheartedly with Richard Landau that this is a very sophomoric novel that really goes nowhere and is VERY predictable. Perhaps if you were in college in the 70's and a part of the CA scene, this might strike a cord. For the rest of us who are older (and I hope wiser!), the book is a real lightweight. Sorry."
5,It's about time!,"Thank God somebody finally wrote a book about this.I found this book to be extraordinariliy meaningful. It helped me get through a very tough time -- my friend's father committed suicide and I wanted to help her, but I didn't know what to do.The book, which I recommend to anyone who has ever felt awkward in trying to help a friend cope with loss, offered real suggestions from people who have been there. It was friendly and practical and I appreciated that.A compilation of about 200 people who have delt with a death, the book packs punch and drips in credibility. It's most definitely a must read for anyone who wants to help a friend."
4,Really Great Tool,Really Great Tool am impressed. i've tried pretty much every brand out there . From ace strippers to klein.It seems like a really sturdy product so far.The strippers are covered with some really thick plastic.hard enough but also feels soft in a way in your hands. It does what it supposed to do. The only thing am dissapointed is that i didn't really look for the things i wanted in a stripping tool.It's my first irwin stripper so its a test tool for now. I wish they made the 2 small holes on each side right above where it bends that way it would be easier to bend wire.But i guess i have to buy the industrial strippers with the crimp to have the hole. Its not a big deal but i would of been 5/5 if they had them there. Great tool overall.
5,Worth it,This DVD has a wide variety of Popeye cartoons. I would recommend it to any one who loves Popeye cartoons.
4,One Of My Favorites,"I believe this is a re-issue (one of numerous) of the album Once Upon A Time. The previous review is correct in it's assertion that there's very little, if any, between song banter which has been edited out. This is rare for a Kingston Trio live album. However, the music is top notch. The vocals are right on target. In fact, this and Live at the Crazy Horse are my two favorite KT live albums. Worth checking out."
3,flimsy,Kinda flimsy!!! Thought it would stay open by itself but you hafta have a lunch box or something solid to keep it from collapsing in with the top open.
3,know your purchase...,"My boyfriend is a big fan of Cheech and Chong whereas I have only heard of them and am not familiar with their movies. When I did a search on Amazon I found this ""Greatest Hits"" pack and thought it was a great deal. However, we have yet to watch ""Still Smoking"" all the way though despite several attempts. I believe that this 2-pak is a way to sell the bad movie with a great one. My advise is know what you are purchasing before you wind up disappointed like us."
1,"Get The Double Feature from Paramount for less dough,READ ON!!!","The one star is NOT for the C&C movies,it's for the package,this is NOT their greatest hits okay(Up iN Smoke is a no brainer but Still Smokin,hmm well it Is better than Corsacan Bros by a landslide,it's just thier two films for Paramount in abox set!!! But save yourself some green stuff(I mean money by the way!)and buy the Double feature(the one in the yellow packaging) THAT has the same two films and is a hack of a lot cheaper to boot and is more space saving as well!!!"
5,Bible Story Time,"My 3 year old asks for her bible story. The story lessons are very simple, practical, and appropriate for my young girls."
4,bedtime reading,"My daughter (age 5) loves for me to read a few of these every night. Sometimes I edit them while I'm reading, and we seldom do the activities that accompany the readings, but they work pretty well for communicating basic Christian values and good behavior."
2,"For Maximum Enjoyment, Go Deaf","Okay, I'mma lay this out for you:You must really, really, REALLY love hokeyness and midi files to like this album.And that's it."
3,Count Me Out,"I really enjoyed the Ode to Pres where Clark Terry gives us those ""mumbles"" on his horn. I already have so many of the Basies' recordings that I always have to check to see if it's in my library. Some are. No way for me to buy the album, but If you want Count's piano without the album, go for My Main Men."
2,Not very clear!,This book contains 10 ideas for games which seem to be what every child would enjoy. The problem is that most of the figures used in the book to give construction details leave a lot to be desired. Most of the photos are black and white and difficult to see any detail. The drawings are also in black and white and are also very difficault to follow.
5,The Whole World Wears Blinders,"This is an awesome personal story of someone tied up through friendship to the victim of a hate crime. It also details the further victimization of that friend through the media that so many of us rely on for the truth. This book is about Romaine Patterson from youth to adulthood and her experiences as a friend of Matthew Shepard's and the Shepard family. This book should not be mistaken as a personal account of Matthew's short life. Way to go Romaine, our community could use many more like you."
1,Not very helpful,"This book is not very helpful. After reading the entire book, I felt I had not learned more than I had by casually glancing over the program. It does not go into very much detail and leaves many questions unanswered. Don't waste your time with this book if you're looking to really understand the nuts and bolts of Quicken."
2,tag huer carrera,"unable to figure out how to keep the date correctly set. Seems that every morning it's off by one day, either ahead or behind. great looking watch though. Also, took a while to figure out how to keep it wound. seemed that it ran slow overnight but I have that figured out."
2,Good reference material but not much practical instruction,"The Rhapsody Developers Guide is more a conglomeration of a large set of OpenStep documentation than it is a practical guide to Rhapsody development.The first section of the book is an interesting introduction to operating system design. This section is interesting reading for anyone who hasn't had a good introductory course on Operating Systems at the undergraduate level.The second part of the book regurgitates much of the reference information found in the OpenStep AppKit and Foundation Kit framework guides. The advantage to the Rhapsody Developers guide is that it puts this information in one volume with a comprehensive index.Unfortunately, however, the book contains little practical information on how to use the ""Yellow Box"" frameworks that are the heart of Rhapsody."
2,The Chelsea Whistle,Growing up in Chelsea myself I find this book to be a gross exaggaration of the truth. Michelle's family life was the slum not the streets of Chelsea. You can't blame your dysfunctional life on Chelsea.
3,a third attempt shows true writing skills....,"tea's first two memoirs are full of action and sesationalistic experiences with lovers, drugs and prostitution. where you really find out about the skills of a writer is their ability to make the quieter, less thrilling moments of life interesting. tea's ability to do this is best discribed as average. though i appreciate her story of growing up working class in a poor neighborhood outside of boston, it was somewhat of a struggle to get through this book. i would venture to suggest that tea is certainly an important voice in young, queer culture, she's just not always so well spoken."
5,Long Awaited,"As a dedicated Reginald Hill fan, I was thrilled to learn that this series had finally been formatted to play on US TV.I was not disappointed, what great casting. Could watch them over and over,"
3,Bla Bla Bla,"As a fan of British misteries this falls short of dull and uninspired. I sorry that I need to be hooked by the end of the first eppasode, instead this series left me stating ""is that it""."
4,GOOD SHOW,"Dalziel and Pascoe season 2 is well worth ownimg,it has 4 shows 90 minutes each and who done it type stories.Warren Clarke as Dalziel is very good and the last story in the set is Exit Lines which it looks like he may have killed someone in a hit and run accident,but never fear the real case will be solved,the other three stories are good too so check it out you might become a fan of D AND P."
4,It is a great reference for beginning Access Programming!,"This book is great and it was simple to follow and the pictures in the book make it a good buy adding value to the customer. Also, Good descriptions in the Macros section make it easier to find what Action you need. VBA couldn't be explained any easier. May need to watch for a few flaws in the graphs unfortunately but that shouldn't be the only reason for buying this book."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this player as I have had multiple components from Onkyo in the past (including DVD players) and they have all been really solid.This unit, however, has been nothing but a dud. For a unit of its price and supposed pedigree, it is extremely finicky when it comes to reading DVDs. Too often I insert a disc, wait 30 seconds, and get ""Bad Disc"" on the menu. But when I take that same DVD to my Mac, it works just fine. Error correction is extremely poor - discs that read just fine on other players either stop or skip on this player.Just last night, my wife and I were watching a movie on this unit. Our daughter woke up, so we stopped the movie. 10 minutes later when I tried to restart the movie, the Onkyo told me it was now a ""bad disc"".Forget it. I'm finding another player."
3,Great story but editing is atrocious,"I have the Kindle version, so I don't know if my comments will apply to the printed books. I like the story and sections of it are gripping. Being a historical novel, parts of the battle for Guadalcanal have been omitted or only briefly mentioned, but one definitely gets a sense of the action. Sometimes the fictional dialogue gets kind of hokey. I like that the author included the naval actions, but am disappointed that there are so few details about the heroics of the Cactus Air Force.The big problem I have, however, is with the atrocious editing. Typos abound and are very distracting. Names and places sometimes get mixed up. It definitely detracts from my reading experience to get confused by these errors and have to go back and carefully sort things out, trying to decipher what the author intended.Still, all in all, I enjoyed the book. Too bad all the errors diminished the story itself. I would have rated the book a four, maybe a five, otherwise."
5,Very Entertaining!,I got hooked on this with the first season - you just get hooked!! I can't wait for Season 3 to come out!
2,This is the Canadian version,"I received the Canadian version of this product. The episode summary insert was not included in the package, as in the US versions of Episode One and Three. The Canadian Home Video Rating (14A) and the Canadian distributor Maple Pictures logo are the obvious tipoffs. I have no way to verify if this is the same content as the US version."
1,Title,"Just another terrible dramedy from Showtime. How they manage to market themselves as a ""premium"" network escapes me."
2,Adequate but incomplete account of Hazel's early career,"It's unfortunate that there is so little published materialavailable about Hazel O'Connor's fascinating rollercoaster of acareer.Having seen Hazel perform and tell stories about her lifeand career, I know what the readers of this book back when it first came out did not know: that she was being screwed left and right by the music industry. Also, that her brief popularity was about to surge downwards due to forces in that same music industry.Nonetheless, the book is short but full of interesting anecdotes, some light, some dark (notably her account of being raped in a foreign country). It is certainly an easy read, seemingly aimed at teenaged fans.If you are a Hazel O'Connor fan and can get a copy of this book, do so because it is unlikely you'll find much more about her. I wish there was a more in-depth and complete book to recommend."
3,Will the author please test and update the code sample!,"I bought the book a week ago and got disappointed immediately after I downloaded the code from APress. Most of the code won't work at all. There are many compile erros and obsolete method calls.If the author care about his readers at all, please test and update the code sample. Readers of this book wants to learn about GDI+, rather than how to debug.The book looks like a term paper, too many double spaces and code listings to make up the pages. Nevertheless, it does contain useful information. So without much other books available on this subject, this book is still a buy."
1,18v replacement pack,BOUGHT THE BATTERY FIRST THEN DISCOVERED MY CHARGER WAS BAD. ORDERED A CHARGER AND AFTER 30 MINUTES IT QUIT. GRADY'S REPLACED WITH ANOTHER AND IT ALSO QUIT IN 30 MINUTES. THEY ARE GIVING CREDIT TO ME BUT I MUST RETURN THE BATTERY PER THE RETURN POLICY. DISSAPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCTS PREFORMANCE.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,"Was adverised to fit my drill and whenit did not they changes the advetisement and did not return my money. I have just given them, $79.00. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM."
5,A rare artist...,"I saw her live the other night and she's awesome. I liked it so much, I went back the next night to see her again I was that impressed by her. I picked up her cd and liked it. But she is one of those rare artists who blows you away when she's live. If u like her album, seeing her live is no comparison. She brings her emotions into the songs and she's amazing. Her songs are real and honest to herself. She has a range of sounds, ballads to rock. ""Song You Wanted"" starts off slow and melodic and about 1/2 way through it picks up. ""Liar"" is also an up-tempo rock song. She is a very talented young lady. She's been compared to Ani DiFranco, Alanis Morrisette and Jill Scott. If you like them, you'll love her. This is her second album and she is ready to start working on her 3rd. I recommend that you geth both."
5,So easy,Awesome pool float. Blows up in seconds. Only took me 3 breaths to blow up the outside ring. I love floating in it while having my body partially submerged in the pool.
5,kelsyus water hammock,"I bought two of these and found them to be easy to blow up and use. A little harder to fold than to unfold but I got it done and storage doesn't take much space. In use, they're great, comfortable to lie on and you don't need to balance yourself, as you do with a more solid type of float. These appear to be generally well made of reinforced material but I did have a problem with the mesh weave on one of my two. I notified the importer in VA and they quickly sent me a replacement, no questions asked. I'm well satisfied."
3,Not as big as it seemed...,"...the picture. I thought it would be bigger. Your practically laying in the water being hold up by some floaties. Probably would hold a large body, but is really easy to fill , since there is not much to it."
3,"Love the Raft, but poor quality construction","These rafts are perfect for the pool, by far our family favorite and tough to find. The mesh lets you stay cool in the pool, and yet get some sun. The first time I used this product the fabric on the outer edge ripped. Poor quality construction. For $25 for a raft I expect a little more. I won't be buying Kelsyus products again."
5,Every Woman Should Read this Book!,A rare voice of reason and compassion. Dr. Dixon-Mueller gives us a chance to look clear-eyed at the facts . . . and the facts speak for themselves. Every woman should read this book! -- along with every single person involved on either side of the debate. Bravo!
4,4.5 on the star chart.........Hmmm maybe a 5. GET IT ANYWAY!,"IT'S GOOD MUSIC!!! that's all you need to be concern with. Personaly, I think she did justice to the remake of Nat King Coles song ""Tenderly"". Nice grooves, tight beats and excellent production. It needs to grow on me a liitle more. I haven't really given it a chance. Hell, I can't get past the 1st track without repeating it. The last track ""Changes"" has got to be one the best drum & bass tracks I've heard this year. My quest for SOMETHING DIFFERENT has expanded my music library to the wildest of genres and this one fits perfectly in my pile of sweet ear candy.oNe"
5,Best cd this year,"Ok I say this because I truly believe it. This cd has the perfect blend of genres. Greatness is no *Illusion* when it comes to Soulstice. They've passed up the chance of becoming famous by not listening to the conformist ideas of their previous label and they did what they wanted to do, which was create beautiful music. So buy the cd and take a trip into ""Electric Soul.""..."
3,Buyer,"My wife says the stethoscope works well, but she could hear feadback she believed to be from the two tubes rubbing together. It is also a little heavy."
4,know what you are buying,This looks like an excellent book - I have just started dipping into it and it is what every practitoner needs - lots of practice wisdom. Just be aware that the actual copyright is 1989. I assumed that it was a 2009 revised edition - in fact it is a 2009 paperback edition of the 1996 Free press hardback edition. It is not a second edition. Pity - I would love to see what James has to add.
5,great,great wrestle mania the special features are great cool that Jesse the body ventura was the narrator of the mania of wrestle mania i ordered this DVD for the great main event and the other matches
4,Kurt Angle should use more moves like he used to,"I'm not sure if Kurt(my favourite wrestler)got worse from his neck injury(he's still fast)but he used a few moves(except mat based), Against Eddie he used belly to belly suplex and 1 of rope, german suplex. Where's the missle drop kick or moonsault of top turn buckle, waist lock take down or that sick inside out german suplex. Watch the street fight on King Of The Ring 2001 and you'll see what I mean. Anyway the match was the best of the night and I think it's alot better than the overated triple threat match. It started of fantastic with Shawn and Chris Benoit then HHH ruined it. HHH needs to retire because since his quad or something was torn from his leg he got werse I heard(I got into wrestling in mid 2001 so I never sore him wrestle before because he was injured).The Cruserwieght match is underrated, Christian/Jericho was was surprisingly great."

1,One of the worst,"I don't know what others think, but in my opinion the WWE has been going downhill for many years. I mean the amount of build up for the matches at Wrestlemania XX was slowly diminished as the matches began. c'mon, lesnar and goldberg was pathetic and kane and undertaker was a joke. Barely any of the matches lived up to expectations. How in the hell is Eddy Guerrero still champion. There is no way that eddy guerrero or benoit can carry the company like austin or hogan did in the past. Wrestlemania was once an event where legends like Bret Hart, Hogan, Macho Man performed in classics that are remembered to this day. Unless you truly enjoyed the event, it would be better to just rent the dvd. Hopefully vince will one day release the previous wrestlemanias on dvd."
5,Well........,"Since some ppl ruined wresltemania 20 for me i am going to ruin wm21 for them ,Batista vs Triple H:Batista WinnerUndertaker vs Randy Orton:Undertaker WinnerKurt Angle vs HBK:Kurt Angle WinnerJohn Cena vs JBL:John Cena WinnerAkebono vs Big show:Akebono WinnerTrish Stratus vs Christy Hemme:Trish Stratus WinnerMoney In The Bank Ladder Match:Edge WinnerRey Mysterio vs Eddie Guerreo:Rey Mysterio"
5,Turn this one up to eleven!,"All I can say is Rock and Roll is Bach and better than ever! Sebastian Bach continues to amaze with his incredible vocals and overall presence. The live songs gives one the feeling of being in the crowd, drums booming, guitars blaring and Bach whaling like he has for the past 10 years. This kid doesn't miss a beat without his former band mates, as this disc is a refreshing taste of how music was meant to be heard, loud with passion and excitement!"
3,"Eric is great, this video is not","In this video, as many other have mentiomed, Eric shares 10 concepts that have defined his style, and there are many performances that are just mind blowing. The problem with this DVD for me was that it is not an instructional tape per se. You won't get a lesson from him in the traditional sense, he will share many of his ""secrets"" and I especially found that the chapter on chords was insightful, but there is no proper teaching, no tabs, no slow speed, etc. Just picture having a conversation with Eric and that's it. More like an interview I'd say. The video qualityn is great, excellent sound and settings, terrific band and music, but not much instruction for $31."
3,Excellent concepts,"This book explores excellent concepts of all values as human and only socially ascribed by gender. It is a important look at what make us alike. However, the writing is circular and at times the logic is ill supported. I recognise that it is typical of feminist writing to be created delibrately in the context of 'a person wrote this' rather than by some all knowing authority. I have read much good feminist writing that does that. This book does not. Many of the small supporting conclusions that the author makes (especially in regard to 'primitive' societies) seem emotional and shallow. The writing style does a great diservice to the wonderful concepts it attempts to display."
1,these can catch the house on fire,just read where these bulbs will burn out and the ballast will catch fire and shoot fire out the side 4 feet long!
2,Low quality,I bought three packs of eight a couple months ago and now only two thirds of them are still working. The first one burnt out a couple days after putting it in. I would advise buyers to look elsewhere.
2,Disappointing color temp,"I gave the 4-pack version of these a try as I continue my search for a CFL bulb with as pleasing a color temperature as typical 60W soft-white incandescents. Maybe I'm just more sensitive to it than most, but to my eyes the light generated by these has a harsh, slightly greenish tint to it. They also suffer from about a one second delay between when you flip the switch to when they actually turn on. Tried multiple bulbs in the pack and they were all the same. For now I'll stick with the NVision bulbs from HD which at least turn on instantly."
1,"Perfect for use in the outhouse, better than toilet paper!","Vile, disgusting piece of manure! Filled with gratuitous sex. Portrays a degrading picture of Lilian Jackson Braun. Save your money and buy a book worth reading!Mine will go in the fire next time we use the fireplace."
5,"Another fun Read ""ghost~writer""!","I was a little confused as I didn't realize there was another 'The Cat Who' mystery series out there, but it seems we have another fun read from Mr. Braun on our hands. Some may say the author is by another name but they have probably never heard of a ""ghost~writer"" either! Mr. Braun has shown he can adapt to the language of the age by spicing things up a bit. I found it another fun read and look forward to more 'The Cat Who' novels."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY...,This book is not funny! The only amusing material in this book was a description of the main character trying to give his cat a pill. What a waste of money!
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!!!","I've not been this disappointed in a book in a long time. I managed to get through 2 chapters before I pitched in the recycling bin. The story had great potential, but was filled with references to sex acts, boobs, and genitals. I don't see how this book would appeal to ANYONE that has read any of the Cat Who books. Don't waste your money on this garbage if you're a Jackson Braun fan."
1,A real stinker!,"""The Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun"" enjoys the dubious distinction of being the worst book it has ever been my misfortune to read. I only finished the wretched thing because of the rave review it received in Publishers Weekly -- I kept hoping against hope something funny or clever -- or both -- would happpen. It didn't. The only place I even cracked a smile was at an exchange on page 142:""I mean the name for some totally amoral, skank-ass, saliva-dripping poon-rat.""""I think the term is: Member of Congress.""The above exchange will, I believe, have a wider resonance in this election year (2010) than previously, when it would have been pertinent primarily for those of us living in the DC Metro Area.To call ""the Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun"" puerile or sophomoric would be high praise indeed! The best use for this book would be to use it to line a litter box -- it could be called ""The Cat Who Expressed a LITTER-ary Opinion.""I award this stinker of a book five -- five SKUNKS!"
5,Delightful art and whimsy!,"A delightful assortment of Kliban's excellent, witty and whimsical art featuring cats! Essential for cat lovers and fans of light, cheerful art. Cats indulging in various human activities but with a unique cat-style approach."
4,Just like the old days,I bought this video because I had one about 15 years ago on VHS. It worked then and it is working now.
4,Surprisingly good,"I have to admit, I was skeptical. I did not think this was going to be a good video or a good work-out, due to the poor quality of some celebrity fitness videos I have tried in the past. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this video. It is a challenging workout, high quality, and fun to do. It does require a bit of strain on the knees, so I don't know if I'd receommend it to someone with bad knees. Overall, though, I think it is a tough, fun workout and an excellent video. With her trainer's help, Cindy Crawford is very good about safety tips and explanations and actually seems to enjoy the workout. Definitely worth it."
2,Doesn't work beyond two months,I purchased this doll for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas and within one week it was not working. I returned it to Amazon.com and they quickly sent another one. That one worked for about two months and now it doesn't work.
2,Disappointed,Text looks grainy.Using Clear type makes it looks even worst.I had chance to compare it with Sony 18'LCD side by side - can't compete.
5,My niece loves this book!,"I bought this book to read to my four year old niece. She wanted me to read it over and over. She said, ""I like bibimbop!"" and she had never even tried it. We made a list and went together to an Asian food store to buy the ingredients and made it for dinner. (Using the recipe from the book.) Everybody loved it!"
2,Should be placed in FICTION,A warped sense of reality is what plagues Conason. He delights in supourting his view with mirepresentation and half truths...never looking at the whole scope of goverment and framing ideas and situations to suit his purpose despite how farfetched and misaligned they are...I recommend SPIN SISTERS for a truthful account of what is going on!!!!!
2,polemicist2far,"As an unabashed liberal, who voted for Al Gore, and-- gasp!-- even George McGovern, it is time that somebody write a book answering the Ann Coulters and Rush Limbaughs of the world. However, this is not the book, and apparently the writer is not up to the task.This books seems hastily put together; a ""clip job"" so it seems. And in targeting polemicists of the right, Mr. Conason does not answer with reason and fact. Rather, he answers with polemics of his own. He engages in ad-homenim attacks, selective use of facts, and overblown rhetoric.But most of all he does little if any original reporting or research, simply quoting others. The conclusions are his own, but hardly unoriginal. As someone who liked ""The Hunting of the President"", the difference between that book and this that there appears to be no hard work done.This is an important topic, and ordinarily capable writer, but unfortunately the writer was not very capable in regards to his publication of this book."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I read this book and Ann Coulter's Slander book one after the other.I'm not American, so it was an exercise of personal interest, rather than something I'm emotionally involved in.By way of comparison I found this book to be somewhat more rhetorical in nature than Coulter's, and less founded in examples and references. As an analytical writer myself I have to admit to preferring the well documented style of Coulter's book.I can see that Americans are pretty divided one way or the other over which perspective they hold, but to a foreigner they're both interesting books.I really wanted to like this book too, but I just found Conason a little too heavy on rhetoric, and a little too light on providing well documented examples and references."
5,"Big Lies Promised, and Delivered.","Joe Conason shoots, scores, nothing but net.This was one of those books I couldn't put down. He takes on some of the biggest lies the right wing propagandists and agitprops have delievered, and one by one, disassembles them. Unlike the right wing bleach blond polemists, Joe provides not only well researched answers to the charges of the right, but does so in a seamless manner, with more documentation than you could hope.I had an initial criticism when I finished the book, in that I wish he provided us with some ideas as to what we can do about the mainstream press being stenographers of the right wing operatives. But I came to the position that Mr. Conason has accomplished that task, by his countless examples of shoddy journalism."
4,Eddie Murphy Collection,"This was an excellent product. I never realize what an Eddie Murphy fan I was until I purchased the Eddie Murphy Collection. It was a great way to enjoy action and comedy into a great blend. I did not have to stop with just one movie, I had other choices to choose from. These movies are all to be classics and a great way to remember and appreciate the 80s and honor it with the respect it deserves. Thank you for the opportunity to enjoy the collection and remember Eddie Murphy for the classic comedian he is and appreciate his talents."
4,Good - Kind of small and not energy efficient,It's a bit pricey for the size - but overall it looked very nice.It's my fault for not reading that it's incandescent light where it requires one of those small lamp lightbulbs where it didn't deem to fit an energy efficient bulb.
5,Terra Cotta Plant Pot,Very nice looking and exactly what I expected. It was a gift and the recipient was pleased. Shipping was quick.
4,Great introduction and a nice read..,"A great introduction to the history of economic life as well as a reference to numerous phenomena that play a vital role yet remain unnoticed in our everyday life. I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested as an easy and joyful read.On the other hand, the book could benefit from a more structured approach, both between its chapters (which are somewhat loosely connected) as well as within its chapters (in terms of concepts presented and frameworks considered).If you're just starting out on evolutionary economics or on the interplay between sociology and economics, this would be a good and interesting book to look for."
5,"wow, what a book!","I'm an economist who researchers, thinks about, and writes about these issues all the time. It has been a long time since I was so impressed with an author's creativity. He helped me see ordinary economics in a whole new fashion. One of my favorite books."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This watch is an older model that they do not sell anymore. The pictures say that it is ""gunmetal"" in color, but it is actually light green. It was in good condition, but very dated looking. I would recommend that you buy one from a store so you can see it first."
3,Well amazon sent this too me too late,I did not know this was so late and i opened it and found I had already seen most episodes. I think it may be a good idea not to acept back ordrs for dvd releases.
3,Great CD!,"I love this CD it is awesome. My favorite songs on there is ""The Great Beyond"" and ""Man on the Moon"" this is one of the best CD's I got. I have never seen this movie and I have been wanting to see it but it's not in theaters anymore but I still love this CD."
5,Fantastic Sountrack. R.E.M does it again!,"First off, when people are reviewing this, remember that it is only a soundtrack with the goal of promoting a movie. First, I love the new R.E.M. song, The Great Beyond, and I admit that is the reason I bought this CD. But everything else flows so completely well. The dialogue makes perfect sense where it is, and will probably work even better once I have seen the movie. The brevity of it (37 minutes) bugged me at first, but I have now come to appreciate it as it is easily digested in one sitting and never seems to be dragging on. Remember that this is supposed to be more a timeline of Andy's life and not an R.E.M. album and not a CD full of catchy radio tunes. Just sit back, relax, and remember Andy Kaufman and you will enjoy this immensely."
1,Kaufman the hack,"Once again Kaufman uses my good name to get places-the only reason to buy this MoonMan record is the songs by the real talent, Tony Clifton. Believe it, leave it, be it."
4,Qualität in Reihe !,"seit vielen Jahren höre ich Richard Thompson. nach seinen wunderschönen Alben mit Linda und den Soloalben der letzten Jahre, nun wieder ein Glanzlicht. Hört euch die Spielfreude beim ersten Song an und Danny Thompsons Bassläufe - herrlich"
2,You can't blame the execrable Froom for this yawner.,"As a long time fan, it's sad to comment that old rt is verging on becoming just another sensitive, intelligent but DULL singer/songwriter. This hook free endurance test is a big letdown, especially since I thought the lackluster nature of his last few discs was due to that overly-fussy master of empty sonic effects, m froom.Well, actually, the well has run pretty dry. Of course it's still better than most records of its type, but the heights of his early gems are but a dim memory at this point. This is just the kind of bland coffee house fare that the NPR crowd just eats up. I think he has lost touch with the celtic/british folk and rock fusion that made his work so unique. Too much time living in America? I don't know, but this is the last time I buy a rt cd without listening to it first."
5,Never disapointed with Mr. Thompson,"I am certainly never disapointed with any of the recent releases by Richard Thompson. This CD also delivers to form - several gems and absolute beauties on this one. I am astonished that this prolific musician has produced SO MUCH significant music in our times - how lucky we are to have him in our graces.My absolute favorites on this album (and there are many) BATHSHEBA SMILES, UNINHABITED MAN, THAT'S ALL, AMEN, CLOSE THE DOOR & HOPE YOU LIKE THE NEW ME. These songs raise the hairs on the back of my neck everytime. Wow... This is one great collection of songs."
1,Attitude,"Too much emphasis on aggression and chops, that gets you a lot of street cred in the guitar hero world, but is inclined to be grating on the nerves. I have put on Affif's tracks for my musically literate friends who sometimes ask ""Why does he play everything so fast?"". Seems like his playing is inherently too competitive, which, in my opinion, is a quality incompatible with the real aesthetics of music."
1,Amazingly huge waste of money,"My daughter wanted this doll for Christmas and did not get her. She then saved her money for months to be able to afford to buy Allysen on her own. The second time my daughter played with this doll, the doll lost her ability to ""converse"" with us. After serveral frustrating tries to play with her, my daughter gave up and asked if we could sell her to get her money back. She seems great in advertisements, but do not waste your money, she will not last long!"
1,Aggravating Allysen,This is a very frustrating doll. Does not recognize commands and is very difficult to start over or even to turn off. My 5 year old picks this doll up and always ends up throwing it down in frustration. It's too bad this was marketed for I'm sure it must have surely still been in the testing stages! This doll was a good idea but has ended up costing a lot of hard earned money to go to waste.
1,BIG waste of money,"My daughter saved up birthday & holiday money to buy this doll. She has it ""programmed"", but hates it because it does not recognize her voice responses. She tries to play with the doll, but always winds up in tears of frustration and anger. She now uses Allyen's accessories to play with her more simple dolls. Yes, simple dolls. You know - the dolls that allow little girls to use their imagination during play. I just can't believe this doll cost SO much and is SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!!"
2,One of the weakest western series,"I have seen a lot of TV westerns, but this is not for me. I do not like detective or police stories and this series combines traditional western with police work. I like Audie Murphy, I have nothing against him. He is always easy to watch. His pal, Guy Mitchell, is not a big help. I have read that this series was supposed to be violent. It is not that violent, which is a good thing. Of course, tastes are different, but I prefer Have Gun Will Travel, Bat Masterson, The Rifleman and many others."
2,Product did not work for me.,I could not get the thing to work on my computer after countless tries and help from my manufacturers customer service. I went for the good price but ended up getting a refund anyway.
3,smaller than they should be,"I bought these to mail DVDs in. I picked the size that fits DVDs for other brands of envelopes, but this was slightly too small and couldn't do the job. Otherwise there is nothing wrong with the product, but if you are going to buy it, go bigger than you think you need."
4,Good variety/starter pack.,"I wasn't really sure what sizes I would need to ship items I was selling, so this seemed like a good option. Most of the items I had were very small, so I haven't found that I've needed to use the larger envelopes, but it's still good to have them to experiment with and see which size fits what. It's a good starter pack for sure, though you may want to check dimensions before purchasing if what you're shipping is a common size as some of these seem unusual."
5,"vitally important, a must-read and act-upon book","""A Reason to Vote"" opened my eyes to the state of our democracy, and how we the people have been denied any substantive choice of leaders by the crushing two-party system and by the tyranny of special interest lobbies. However, more important than exposing the problems, Mr. Roth offers a practical solution that empowers his readers to turn around the deplorable state of politics and government in the USA: The Natural Law Party. ""A Reason to Vote"" is so powerful it has even inspired me, a person who could be described as usually apolitical, to join the Natural Law Party and run for office!"
3,Not too hot...,"I have to say I am not a big fan of these Shawn Trautman videos. On the plus side, they are very easy with lots of repetition. But, I find them very dry. There is really nothing 'hot and spicy', this is all just basic steps you'd learn if you take a lesson at a club.What really bugs me is that the music on these videos isn't salsa, for the most part. There are very few parts where you have a chance to practice the moves with actual music."
3,This cables won't work properly for all 4 cilinders BMW 318i,"These cables are slightly longer than the original ones installed in my BMW 318is model: 1996, but this didn't make any inconvinience. The plugs were inserted properly in both ends (coil pack and plugs). unfortunately, the plugs of the coil pack side, are 90 degrees angled, while the originals are about 120 degrees, it will not allow the installation of the dust cover under the bottom of the coil pack. If omiting the installation of such protection is not a problem for you, you may use them, otherwise it will not be recommended because the dust protection will not be reinstalled."
2,hate them!,wrost shoes I ever bought. I bought them for a wedding and a size to big and then when I put them on I could not wear them and was in a big bind that day. Do not buy this!
5,Long awaited,"After the release of Blackacidevil, which did not fare well next to Danzig 4, Satan's Child was anticipated by all Danzig fans everywhere. Not only did Glenn Danzig go above and beyond with one of his most glorious performances but he also expnaded his musical capabilities. All Danzig fans were and are very pleased with this CD and so will you. Glenn's dark, gothis demenor shows through with just the right twist of heavy metal and alternitive. We are now anticipating the soon to be released Danzig 7."
2,Glenn Should Be Ashamed,"If you like Danzig 1 through 3, run from this. Although this does seem like a logical conclusion to what many have seen as a steady downward spiral. I feel bad for Glenn."
4,when you can sing as good as Glenn...,"why use voice destortion? Glenn has an awesome voice but in this it is distorted way too much sometimes and it makes it hard to listen to. The music is good, but not as good as it used to be. To people who are hardcore fans of Danzig 1-4 and hate 5: don't get this. But if you worship everything Glenn does (like I do), then you'll find some things you'll like about this album. Don't get me wrong-I like this. But it's not as good as his earlier work."
1,The Worst,"To think Danzig 5,7, and 8 are better than this! If you own this cd kill yourself. If it is given to you. burn it."
3,good only while it lasts,"this phone is pretty cool. however, after 10 months, people started complaining that they cannot hear me properly. Vtech sent me a new phone under warranty and now even the replacement phone has started behaving similarly!"
5,"Wonderful deal, Extremely happy with telephones",I absolutely love this telephone. The extra telephone that does not require a telephone jack works great plus saved the expense of having another telephone jack installed. I haven't had any problems with these telephones.
5,Fat Cat Owner!,"I have several very fat, fuzzy, kitties! I was afraid this window perch would not support their weight. I was wrong! I have two big male kitties, one approx. 25 lbs. and the other approx. 20 lbs. They can both sit on this perch at the same time! They love to look out the window, or, relax and take a nap on it. It is very sturdy and attractive. I do have it screwed into the window frame, not just ""placed"" in the window frame slot. I would definitely suggest getting this window perch if you have big boys like me!"
4,I'M Nakamura... HE's Yamagata.,This is my family's favorite movie. I just transferred a VHS to DVD as it's unfortunately out of print and VHS tapes are becoming a thing of the past. It actually came out pretty good too! I've tried writing to MGM to inquire about a studio transfer but my pleas fell on deaf ears.
5,Charming Sleeptime Video,I bought my daughter this video the year she was born. She knows all the kids featured on the video. She's six. This evening she dropped the video and the casing cracked. She was inconsolable. Thank goodness for [you all]. I don't think bed time would be the same without these adorable babies and kids.
1,The Original African Heritage Study Bible,"Don't read this it's just some racist propaganda with a black power slant. I'm black and a christian and this book is bias and doesn't lead people to unity but separation and hatred for our fellow man of every race. I believe and know black people are in the bible and God loves them just like all other people, but the mistake here is to exalt one race as superior than another and fill people with pride and bigotry. Jesus said he's not a favorer of any man and that he died for everyone from ever nation, kindred, and tounge. Who soever that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Please remember this and avoid Satans tactics. In Psalms it states one of the 7 things the Lord Hates is a man that causes division among his brethren."
1,Fact even Sicilians are white,"The Romans of Italy had next to no african blood in them . The Romans ruling Egypt were from Italy, France, Germany and other European areas. Jesus could easily have been white and passed in Egypt without attracting any racial attention. This book has this Jesus-had-to-be black and other nutty notions.About the Romans coming from Germany. The Romans commanded by Julius Caesar and then Augustus conquered the area surrounding the Rhine River and later Elbe Rivers more than 10 years before Christ was born and kept it until the 400's ad. In just a few years after conquering the Germans living around the Rhine were sometimes taken into the Roman Army and sent all over the empire including Egypt. The Roman territory around the Elbe was lost in 9 AD by rebellious Germanic tribes but the Rhine area continued sending Germans to Roman places including Egypt."
2,Proofreader Required,"Upon reading several passages, I began to find typos in this Bible. This is the first Bible that I've seen with typos.Psalms 21:2 - Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.This scripture sticks out to me the most. If you have the Bible, I encourage you to look at the scripture. At the end, it says, ""... his liSelah."" When I first read that, I was too confused. I had to go to another Bible to see what was being said. There are other typos in that version of the Bible, but I've quit reading it and don't remember them anymore.All things need to be in decency and in order. Typos of God's Word is not. Have a blessed day all."
1,Not Humperdink at his best,I've see Mr. Humperdink's live concert and I was impressed with the way he can deliver a song. This album fails to capture the artistry and excitment of his live shows. His greatest hits and his covers of standards are where he shows his strength. Please release me from this album!
2,Not really wow,This album is not as good as I expected. There is one or two songs that are not too bad. But not much to write home about for me.
2,Never4Get,"This is not a perfect fit for a 2012 VOLVO XC60, but once installed it does look appealing, my better half loved the look. But although it looked like a leather copy cat it is of flimsy construction. The stitching in the sit had to be reinforced in both covers, and because it doesn't fit the one piece headrest, and no stretching properties I could not secure the hooks on the back to the bottom, I expect the stitching to fail prematurely either from the top of the headrest or in the seat. One thing though, the $26 I paid through AMAZON was a great savings over other e-retailers of $49-$60. I love the lumbar support padding but it is cheap sponge and probably won't last long."
5,Janet Always puts on a GREAT show,I LOVED this DVD. Janet Jackson is one of my all-time favorite live performers and this DVD did not disappoint.
2,VTech,This is a 5.8 GHs expandable phone in my home. It works well if you are in the same room. Go outside to the pool area and your signal will weaken and finally just drop. When I tried to get a replacement I found the phone has already been replaced by a newer model. Go for the newer models and leave the discontinued stuff on the shelves--- regardless of price.
5,Magnificent!!!!,"This is an great book. I loved it. It captures you into a world like no other. A girl captured by indians and the struggle for friendship, courage and compassion. You will not want to put this book down at all! Trust me."
5,"Power from God to Forgive, John Young","This was an Incredible book. Casually written, so it wasn't 'preaching' in anyway, John Young completely amazed me. This guy went through a pretty tough life growing up etc.. and then when he gets married he completely puts his life into making sure his wife and family are happy and content. This book was so down to earth and straight forward, it seemed as if the author was telling his story to your face. What was even more incredible was that I actually had the oppurtunity to meet him. To have read his story and know the pain and torment this guy has been through was unreal. I didn't know if I should hug him or what. And the best part about the author besides the book itself, is that he is such a nice and genuine person. He is optimistic, happy and genuinely a great person to talk to. It was hard not to look at him and wonder how he does it being through the life this man has."
4,Comfy but toxic,"I bought this pillow over two months ago and just finally started to use it. It has been off gassing horribly and I had to put it n the spare room so it wouldn't give me a head ache at night. I couldn't believe the sticker noting the ""slight harmless smell"" of the pillow. There is evidence now of the harmfull effects of foam off gassing! I think the dizzyness and headaches are evidence enough for me... But it is surely cofortable! Supports my neck without pushing my jaw into a position that causes it to lock up on me like most pillows. Just be sure to open it up and give it a few months to breathe before sleeping on it."
2,I was disappointed.,"This movie certainly does start off extremely effectively, but it rapidly slips into the ""pick em off one at a time"" formula. Just once, I'd like to see a movie where the couple who sneak away to have sex DON'T get killed. Some of the killings are imaginatively done, but the tired approach dampens the overall effect. The final third of the movie, after most of the killing is over, becomes downright ridiculous. If a solidly stylish twenty minute beginning is worth the price of this movie to you, you will get your money's worth. Otherwise, think twice."
4,getting it all wrong!,"I'm getting tired of the constant negative reviews of this movie. The whole point is to serve as a tribute to Argento,Fulci, and Rami, not rip them off as so many reviews have stated on here. What we get with EDT is a tribute to all the italian/american horror films that the director fancied, only with the amped japanese take on gore, and interesting cinematography. Anyone offended by the film's mysoginistc angle obviously haven't seen Argento's ""tenebre""! When you come down to it, the movie delivers what you're promised: Gore, a sadistic killer, and atmosphere o plenty. EDT 2 also is worth checking out, definate nods to ""Suspiria"" in that one!"
2,Felt Misled from the cover information,"I don't teach but I thought this book would help me move my little children through our day at home. The cover of the books says ""190 Activities to Move from the Morning Circle to the End of the Day"". It's not really 190 activities, the book is divided into six areas: arrival, cleanup, snacks/lunch, outside the classroom, nap/rest time and departure. If you want 16 pages of cleanup songs/activities, then this books for you. I was really expecting 190 different activities, not a bunch of ways to do six things. I don't really like the format, if it's something you're supposed to sing, I would want it on a CD, not in a book. I think it could have been organized more effectively in a different format, maybe some quick reference cards with a CD that you could use during the day."
2,Not reliable.,"Chuck collar snapped in two while drilling 1/2"" holes in 4x4's. Failed within the first 10 holes. I would not recommend this chuck to friend."
4,Nostalgic,very fun music reflective of the wwII era. great big bands with wonderful sound. there were a couple of tiny blips in two different songs but not seriously takes away from the total enjoyment.
4,Good product with great packaging,"Aside from being a good CFL with comparable warm light as those of an incandescent, the packaging deserves kudos as these are packaged in a vacuum plastic type as opposed to arriving in a carton box. I ordered several of these and none of them arrived broken. I can't say the same for the 100 Watt equivalent that I had also purchased that came in a box, most of which were destroyed on arrival."
5,The Earlier Gunsmokes Are Outstanding,"I'm 61 and, as a kid, I remember enjoying the early Gunsmokes when Dennis Weaver was part of the cast as Chester. I didn't realize just how terrific the series was until its release on dvd and watching it from an adult perspective. I've been watching the hour episodes on Encore Western channel as well, when Chester was still a character on the show (Dennis Weaver left in 1964) and these early episodes are uncompromising in their outcome. Likeable characters are often killed. You just never know what is going to be the outcome of a particular situation. John Meston and Kathleen Hite are two writers who have been responsible for many of these outstanding pre-1965 Gunsmokes. The chemistry among the cast (Matt, Kitty, Doc, Chester) is perfection. I agree with everyone that all subsequent seasons should have been released as one volume like season 1. Since they're not, I'll pay the price. I have to own these."
5,Gunsmoke,This is probably one of the Best Westerns and longest running shows from Hollywood to date. It is well worth the price to add to your collection.
2,Listenable...but not memorable,"This album from Tall Paul has a couple of decent tracks on it. ""Copy Rat"" has a nice build-up and break down section. But that's about it. The whole release is just...ehh...ok. It's not necessarily ""bad"" by any means...it's just not memorable."
4,Good addition to your collection.,"One of the things I liked about this film is that it gives a pretty good explanation of early development the P-47 and actually includes some footage of Seversky himself. The film does have some footage that I have not seen in my other titles however as you might assume there is footage used in this film that you will see in many other related films. There is one problem that I have with this film and that is that who ever produced or directed this film actually copied transcript from another film I own and used it for their own naration. I was pretty upset when I was hearing the narrator saying the same script I have in one of my other films. No originalty there! Anyhow It goes over the same MTO ""Medeteranian Theater of Operations"" Operation Strangle footage as seen in many other P-47 films and oh! by the way that is the part they copied. Enjoy!"
3,Just Okay Replacement Chuck,"This chuck is okay for general handyman work. It is definitely not up to the standards of the US made OEM unit. It is not as robust and the key is small compared to the original. The knurled machining is sort of a joke. But, it's comparable to the OEM chucks that come with today's mid-quality new 3/8"" drills.This chuck will get me a year or so more out of my trusty Makita before it is worn out.It arrived reasonably fast. Packing was marginal but really there is nothing to break.It does NOT come with the left-hand threaded securing screw. Be sure to save your old screw. You won't be able to get a replacement at a big box store. The chuck will work without the screw but it is not as secure especially in reverse.Instructions are okay."
3,My Review,"Nothing wrong with the product. I got it for a really great price, but here is the deal.It was advertised as ""Country of Origin USA"" and the photo graphic clearly showed theMade in USA packaging. Alas, what I received was made in China. That is clearly falseadvertising. If the company would only change the advertisement then everything would be fine.I did email them about this.Bottom line if you need a cheap 3/8"" Chuck that will work hard for a long time then one ofthese will probably work fine. But eventually they will wear out."
4,cheaper blades but harder to close shave,"Bought this old fashioned safety razor to save money on blades. Gillette Mach 3 Blades were running me about 120/yr. With this razor I should be able to get by on about 10/yr. Still learning to use it. Takes awhile to get as close a shave as I get with the cartridge style blade. Like the adjustable blade depth of the Merkur Progress. First pass on 5 last pass on one. Really like the ability to completely disassemble the razor and thoroughly clean and dry it after each shave - impossible with a cartridge style. I guess my criteria of cheap blades, close shave, easy to clean could be best met by a straight razor but I'm too chicken."
4,Merkur P. A. D. E. S. R.,"One of the best razors that I have ever had. Very good quality, classic, glides smoothly on my skin, BETTER than Gillette for sure. Get one."
3,"JUST BECAUSE WE ARE LOYAL , WE BUY IT.","MAYBE WE JUST DON'T SEE IT, BUT THESE DJ'S ARE MAKING COMPILATION OF 25 TO 30 TO FILL A 2DISCS ALBUM, BUT ONLY 8 TO 10 TRACKS ARE VERY GOOD, NOT TO MENTION THAT INTROS ARE WASTE OF SPACE ON THE DISC AND THEN THE OTHER S--T JUST DRAG ON AND ON FOREVER. INSTEAD OF DOING LIKE VAN DYK, TIESTO AND OAKEY AMONG FEW THAT MAKE A CD OF 10 TO 12 TRACKS THAT WON'T LET U SIT FROM BEGINNING TO END.TRY REFLECTIONS OF PAUL VAN DYK, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING.I HAVE TO SAY THERE SOME GOOD TRACKS IN THIS CD, BUT IF STEVE WOULD'VE TAKEN THESE TRACKS A MADE A 1 DISC ALBUM WE STILL WOULD'VE PAID THE $20. I SUGGEST BUY IT USED AT AMAZON."
4,Lots of good info,"I read this book and liked it. There is a lot of stuff about Florida that I wouldn't have thought to consider when making a decision to move there. There are many differences than other areas of the U.S. For example, most houses don't have a basement, so you better keep that in mind if you need the space. In addition to the practical move information, there is a number of chapters on recreation (Weekend trips, Key West, Parks, Beaches etc). This would probably also be useful to current residents."
1,Dreadful,"Forgettable characters, really confusing and random story line. The animation is lousy. The movie seems to be inspired by 'Harold and the magic crayon' (Sam is a little boy running aound in his PJ-s all the time...)- but while Harold is endearing and artistic, this movie is simply annoying...The 'action' is not engaging to the point that I am writing this review while the movie is still running in the background. This might be a show that could hold the attention of a toddler, but, on the other hand, it contains bits that I would find highly inappropriate for a toddler audience (some quite scary scenes, and questionable moments, like, for instance, the polar bear character killing a bunch of fish by farting into the water through a hole cut out in the ice). I am just not getting it...Please save your money and time, and go with something else for a family movie night."
1,Awful,"I really am the type of person to give movies a chance but this movie is dreadful. The description is misleading, the animation is terrible and the storyline is just a jumbled mess.My husband and I did watch the whole movie with our 2 year old son. It was like a mystery science theatre 3000 showing; we couldn't believe how terrible it really was.I've watched plenty of David Lynch and been completely dumbfounded at the end of his films but I find that I was more confused by My Friend Bernard."
1,"don't buy this, if you want a voltage converter","This piece of plastic worth nothing, it does NOT convert the voltage! Amazon should demand more detailed information about the products. When this adapter came, the first thing you notice is that ""This is not a voltage adapter"", but I didn't find that info in the description given here."
5,Very impressed,"This book was such a surprise. Sadly, I'm guilty of judging a book by its cover and this cover was very bad. It sat on my to be read pile for a long time before I gave it a chance. Thank goodness I did. I loved this book. It had me hooked from the first chapter. I actually read it a little slower than most because I didn't really want it to end. There was a definite story besides the hero and heroine. The villain was awesome. He was so well developed that you actually hated him. Usually villains are one dimensional and I've often skimmed over them because they are so stale. The chemistry between the characters was great. There was just enough lust and not too much. I hate it when every second page is the characters denying that they want the other. There was some of that but it was still interesting. I only have 5 keepers and this is one of them."
5,Great News for Arthritis Sufferers,This book is truly amazing and gives hope to the many people that suffer from arthritis. The author is very clear and has an easy to follow program that stops arthritis in its tracks. You don't want to take the chance and miss reading this book. It might change the way arthritis pain is dealt with in the future.
4,Not much left to be said,"Looks like the other reviewers have nailed every point I would make about Minus. Ferocious avant-garde hardcore, blending metal, intense screaming, a dose of emo, aural assaults, fingernails on the chalkboard kinda stuff. I must say this is a great CD but difficult to listen to if you're not in the right mood. After the first three tracks, the sounds and instruments start to separate a little more and the true enjoyment of the album begins. Then, a break in the middle of the album for a nice slow number so you can catch your breath. But it doesn't take long to dive back into their snarly intense world both to wreak complete and utter havoc and to spread their message of political insurrection and veiled spirituality. Favorite track: ""Misdo"". Check it out."
4,"Good mystery, hard names.","I liked the story based during the time of the Pharaohs. I liked the character interactions and the sense of good over evil, but the names were difficult to keep track. Some of the characters had two names, like a nickname and that made it a little easier. But the mystery was a good one."
3,A Big Dummies Disappointment,"I have loved Bob LeVitus's other books but this one for me misses the mark. Confusing search for topics and solutions for problems that I had with Mac OS X leave me searching for another book on X. Too much reference to pre-X operating systems. OS X is a new operating system, I wanted more on X and not a refresher course on previous Mac Operating Systems."
3,Good for its Target Audience,"Bob LeVitus' Mac OS X for Dummies is well written as are all of the Dummy books (my how I hate that denegration, though). It should be fine for newbies and for casual Mac users suddenly facing the new operating system. A bit too jokey/hokey wordy for my taste, but that is probably better for the new and scared. This is the book to recommend to friends and relatives."
4,A tasty bite of fun!,"This is the first book by Hal Bodner that I read. I just loved it. For me Becky is the main character. Oh, Chris and Troy are great but Becky has me hooked. I'm hoping there are some sequels that will feature her and the boys AND more evil nasty characters for them to foil. Now that I've discovered Hal, I'm going to explore more of his other books."
3,GYM Player,I take my to the gym and it works okay. No real issues it works. No great raves either no awsome features and it eats battiers so get some recharable batteries for this one.
1,Bad Design,"Like other reviewers, I found this item frustrating. The item would turn itself off, and then hardly turn itself on. I thought that maybe something was the matter with the battery that it came with, but when I changed the battery, it wouldn't work at all! After fiddling with it awhile, I found that the battery doesn't fit snugly in the battery compartment, so it comes loose and turns off.I liked the price, and the fact that it was a good started player for my younger children, but it didn't even hold up under normal usage."
1,Several episodes edited,"Everyone is saying that ""Darlings are Coming"" is edited, and it definitely is. However there are other episodes missing epilogues too. Andy & Opie Bachelors has a missing epilogue. The part where they are sitting on the porch with Peggy singing ""Cindy"" is not included. I can see edited episodes on several TV channels, why would I buy them?"
4,The Third Season,"The show was the elderly parent's favorite from 1960s USA television. I ultimately bought one collection each, of the first five seasons. The product and materials are completely satisfactory."
4,Cindy Always Comes Through,"Excellent workout--I have no kids but bought it because I have Cindy's other workouts. This workout is NOT just for new moms. Good mix of cardio and weights and good music and scenery. My only 'complaint' is that some of the upper-body moves with weights are quite quick and I prefer to lift slowly to get a good range of motion. Good video, nonetheless."
2,Can't hold baby during exercise,I was really looking for an exercise video that would allow me to hold my newborn while I exercised. This is not one that will work. My baby will have to be asleep for me to use this one. Oh well.
4,"A practical, realistic and easy to follow work out",This is in fact the second video I bought from Cindy. I found this video's exercises effective and easy to follow. The video itself also tell the viewer what kind of exercises that they are doing for each section and therefore one can easily choose whichever they think is more suitable for their needs. Although there are 3 combine execises inside this tape however I always work on the toughest one which is the third one. I am not a very strong girl but I still find it managable. I think both Cindy and her coach has done a good job in designing this exercise. It is really a delight to see how Cindy has got back in shape so fast and in a healthy way !
5,Belly ? What belly?,I guess if I do this DVD often enough I will lose my belly. This workout DVD is really great to start after your delivery!!!
1,The book is a joke,"Don't waste your time. An acquantance suggested this book to help me with my dyslexic son, so we thought may be it would be helpful. No. It tries to suggest that my son should imagine a pinpoint spot in his brain that pulls his thoughts together, and that when he has trouble focusing he should reach back physically with his hand and re-align his thoughts, as if pulling everything together with a thread.I don't need imaginary help. His problem is real and physical not imaginary!The author says he was dyslexic until a grown man, and this is how he was able to overcome his dyslexia and ADHD. I don't know how this helped, but it made no logical sense. The script sounded like something you might discuss with a preschooler, but I could not imagine saying the foolishness he suggested to my 15 year old son."
1,The Gift of Learning- Scientifically Bogus,"Although there are some helpful techniques that Davis describes ( Dial analogy, using clay etc.), this book presents ADHD, dyslexia and other learning challenges in an overly simplistic way that I did not find usefull. The basics of dyslexia and ADHD, according to Davis, can be solved through simple visualization techniques, such imaginging your ""mind's eye"" at a certain point behind your head in order to ground you. Basic explanations of cause and effect, using clay models, will supposedly, develop the concepts of consequences and order that ADHD children are missing. In reality, working with children with learning disabilities is much more complex and is rarely ""solved"" through a standard, one-size-fits- all visualization exercise. Having presented no scientific research or any sort of studies to independently back up his claims, Davis falsely creates expectations of magic cures and instant healing."
4,Good read -,"I like it well enough to look up other books by the same author and order them. Good story, fast read, enjoyable."
2,Could have been much better,"Shannon's research is great, and his love of the sport comes through, but simply put the stories included aren't anything special. Anyone who has grown up listening to and loving our national pastime has certainly heard many stories much better than the ones here.Shannon explains that his intent was not to repeat old anecdotes, but to write a book full of new ones. It's a noble goal, but unfortunately it results in a collection of mediocre and mostly uninteresting stories."
2,Lame Stories from the Dugout,"The stories are lame. They are more incidental than interesting. A young boy may be interested in some of the stories. It is hyperbole to call these very short stories ""The Greatest"" anything.A far better book is The Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told: Thirty Unforgettable Tales from the Diamond by Jeff Silverman."
5,The Greatest Book,This is a great book to read if you like baseball. They are great short story's about baseball players and that are very humours. My favorite story was when the outfielder of the Toronto Blue Jay's threw a baseball at a seagull and killed it. This would be the best book to read if you are going somewhere far away.
1,it stunk!!!!!!!!!!,This is the worst book in the history of books!!!!! My friend said it was good and i won't tell you that his name is cory shneck. Or SMS student. But it is the worst and most boring book in the world! Never read this book even if your being tortured!
1,Time wasted,I had heard of this movie and was excited to see it. Very disappointed with it's turgid pace and garden-variety scripting.
1,Terrible Movie,"This movie is terrible. Not funny or interesting. I kept waiting for something to happen, barely anything does. It is extremely slow. Do not watch this movie, it is a waste of time."
4,classic,"This was the only Nice album worth having before the guitar player left the group! Pre E.L.P. Flower King Of Flies, Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack (a combo of their names) Very cool stuff not to mention Rondo. Great memories of the 60's."
2,"Not really punk, but good","If your a punk fan, like myself, stay away from NFG. This CD is the closest they come to punk, it in itself is pretty good. Stay away from their later stuff, for they follow the course of Blink 182 and MxPx and join the crowd of pop-punks."
5,Absolutely amazing. The best.,"This is definitely the best OST of the series. I loved the music from the latter end of the series, and this is the OST that has it. I've only listened to the first half of the cd so far, and I'm listening to the rest now. The music from this OST will certainly fulfill your expectations. I haven't been keeping track of standout tracks too much, but 13 is definitely one of them. It's one of my favorites in the series, so of course it's one of the top songs on this OST. I would recommend buying it, if you plan to, send me an email at Resolance@gmail.com if you are going to buy it so I can talk to you about it."
2,Disappointed,"If your thinking of getting this to zoom in on objects and get a clearer picture...upgrade your camera or buy a ""real"" lens. What a let down for me. I do however use the wide angle lens all the time, but that's not what I purchased this for. I'm just glad it wasn't too expensive."
5,Bingo!!,"Greatest little invention for popcorn, pops every kernel.BUY, with confidence, this one replaced one I have had for years. There is a larger size than this if you like."
4,Nice read,"Very pleasant read. Enjoyable and fun.Characters are unusual and off the cuff.I wasn't looking for a read that was mind bogglingThis book fit the bill.If you want something that you can kickback, relax and smile a little, this is it."
3,Not a weird left unspoken,"Yes, Robert Tacoma's writing will remind you of Carl Hiaasen. It is about the same place and with some of the same characters. It is a little lighter than Hiaasin's books, but still fun.A little better editing toward the end could have made the final chapters a bit more satisfying.And, if Hiaasin and Tacoma are right, the Florida Keys are a special place with special people..."
3,Didn't Do It For Me,I think I'm trying to make these books better than they are. I read Mr Tacoma's first and should have known better than to buy another one. But my hats off to him for continuing the quest.
4,A useful reference,"This is a useful reference for anyone doing research on Mexico's military. It could have used more period illustrations, paintings, lithographs, etc, but it is still worth having in your personal library. The ""soldado"" is frequently depicted as either an imbecile or a cringing coward, but the facts do NOT bear this out. The defence of the Port of Tampico in 1829 and the Defence of Chapultapec and Churubusco in 1847 all dispell the Hollywood myth. The European connection and the financial woes of the army are explored and, of course, Santa Anna plays a MAJOR roll during the 19th century. If you are a student of military history, go for it !"
5,great flick,"i saw this when it first came onto vhs all those years ago, and just loved it. have been looking for the dvd, saw from the other reviews that it wasn't available in the US, so looked more, and YES!!!!!! its available in Australia FOR SURE on dvd ( i have it) BUT its called Dark Angel, so as long as you have a multizone dvdplayer get this on dvd and continue to enjoy it in all its glory. certainly one of dolphs best, good action and killer aliens!"
1,Keyspan Bluetooth Adapter,"Contrary to the product description, this adapter is not compatible with the Apple Macintosh with a USB port. I have an I-book G-4 that is Bluetooth enabled and it could not recognize the Kespan adapter (BT-A).I emailed Keyspan for technical support and never received a response. Thus, I had to send this back to Amazon and lost $4.00."
2,Not as good as HPNA,"I've had a phoneline (HPNA 2.0) network running fine for a couple of years but need to go to two bridges because Linux support for the HPNA NICs is difficult. Two powerline bridges was cheaper than one more HPNA bridge, so they were worth a try, especially since the phone wiring in this house is pretty screwy. I guess the power wiring is worse, because these two bridges couldn't maintain a connection over more than a few rooms' distance. They were about as good as HPNA 1.0, which isn't very good in a big house. I found another Linksys HPB 200 on EBay and expect that should work."
4,So far so good,"This product has worked well for my 2 year old. She has a very dry scalp and needed some organic products, some others I think were a little too scenty, but this one works really well. She doesn't complain about it. Be sure to keep out of their eyes!"
3,Smells like french toast,"I have a sunburn on my arms, so when I saw a free sample of this at the health food store today, I used a generous amount. It felt nice, and at first it had a subtle almond scent, but by the time I left the store, I smelled overpoweringly of french toast. Exactly like french toast. I mean not just the maple syrup, but eggs and bread, too! It's amusing, but I'd rather not smell this way."
3,bad movie worth watching,"If you enjoy watching bad movies, then this is for you. This movie boasts one of the worst plots ever depicted in a film. But the action is well paced and the girls are fun to watch."
2,MaxxAir Roof Vent Both Broken Not a Happy Camper,"We purchased 2 MaxxAir Vents White ones in 2005. Put them on our toy hauler. Today 4-6-09 went up to the roof to take them off to do a ""get ready for summer"" check up. Both of the vents are breaking where the screws are at. The front vent is the worst. It cracked along each side of the vents about 2"". Now we have to see what we can do to fix the problem. I guess they don't last very long. Like the plastic inside your new car. Made to break after so many years to keep the dealership open."
3,Great Resource,"This book is a great resource book, especially for books to incorporate into your lessons. I don't care too much for how it is organized. I feel like it jumps all over the place and there are now specific lessons for teaching the alphabet or numbers. I also don't care too much for how there are several weekly lessons that focus on a specific day, like August 6th ""Wiggle Your Toes Day"" for a week of lessons. I thick it would be better come up with weekly lessons seperate from specific days. It would still be great to still include these fun days, but maybe in a seperate section, that would allow the teacher to incorporate into that specific day's lesson plan rather than focusing on that one day for a whole week. The book is fun and has great ideas and lessons for dramatic play, music, cooking, math, science, games, art, etc. The list of books to use with lessons is such an awesome help and tool in and of itself."
4,Great ideas...,"Perfect book for preschool activities...hands down. Would absolutely recommend to daycare providers, preschool teachers and stay at home moms. Some of the activities require more work than others...glue, markers, pens, pencils, colored paper...etc...but worth it!Of course, you'll have to do some work on Sunday to prepare for the week ahead's theme and activities."
1,A total bore,"Take a pathological liar of a hero, mix in a silly, spineless ninnyhammer of a dumb heroine and you get a totally ridiculous story complete with religious inaccuracies and awkward prose.The bonus one star is for the magic gingerbread man, which somehow managed to get done without using the oven. Now that is funny!"
2,Where was the *EDITOR*??,"The book had some good elements -- I enjoyed the surprises, and there was some humor. BUT. The language was anachronistic, the ""clues"" were blatant (except to the clueless heroine) and I kept wondering why no Editor had reviewed it... or at least why the Editor had failed to remove the redundancy and gush. Was it written with ""The Handy Regency-Novel Phrase-maker"" in hand? In addition, the hero is simply unbelievable, and the ""bickering"" servants were dreadful, *not* funny."
1,Very UNHAPPY,The bag is way too small it's not even a large!!!Seller Very Nice.The reason I'm stuck with the bag is because I will have to pay over $100.00 US$ in Postage!!!
3,Don't Buy,"This does what it's suppose to do. It would be a better product if they offered it with a USB header for the motherboard rather than a cable coming out the back of the computer and taking up a USB port in the back. Also, they should include an adapter for use in a 5 1/4"" bay.Update: I tried to get this to work in my machine without any success. I think the unit was defective but it wasn't worth my time to send it back. Very cheaply made. I would not recommend this to anyone. I'd drop my review to 1 star if possible."
5,For lovers of Barry and Hal!,"Fantastic stories that feature Barry Allen as the Flash and Hal Jordan as Green Lantern, in their earlier days. A little glimpse into the kindred spirits of two of DC's most legendary heroes and their fun, adventurous, and at times trying friendship.Your appreciation of Mark Waid's excellent work here will be much greater if you already have a love for these two characters, however this is a great read for anybody wanting to get to know them."
3,book,the book gives talks about giving your dog grapes as a treat and they are poison to doys could use a up date
4,"Good magnet, and OK level","A 5"" spirit level isn't going to be highly accurate. But when you're working in tight spaces a small level is better than nothing at all. This unit came in handy when I added some built-in DVD storage shelves in my living room between the wall studs. DVD boxes are only 5-1/2"" deep, and leveling the shelves was a head-scratcher until this thing came up in my Amazon searches. With a bit of tapping to get the bubble to settle after small changes the pocket level got the job done.Interestingly enough, I got a surprising amount of use out of the magnet even though I hadn't considered it when buying the unit. An open wall cavity is just a magnet (pun intended) for dropped nails, and a decent magnet helps greatly in fishing them out. The unit's magnet is more than adequate for grabbing dropped 8d nails."
2,Rod,"Installed, and in one week one went bad. Broken lead in the array. Not as bright as the regular bulbs. I wasted my money."
2,Knutsen,"Beware - the product is different from the Product Description, which says says ""... With 10MM & 100MM On 1 Side & 32"" & 64"" Readings On The Other Side"".However, both sides are graduated in inches -- not milimeters (MM) or centimeters. If you want some metric graduations, this ruler is not for you."
5,Heart Awakening,"With an Open Heart offers the listener an experience to reconnect with their center. There are times in our busy high-tech, low-touch world that we need to take time to just listen. To our own inner voice; to our heart's desire. Suzi's music perfectly supports this. It is the first CD of choice I pull up on my ipod for these sacred times of peace and quiet reflection."
4,Large enough to last a long time,"I can't comment on how well this works for scar reduction, as I've only just started using it, but I can comment on the cost effectiveness. I was a bit put off by the price, but once it arrived, I discovered that I could just cut a strip off the edge of the sheet and it was long enough to cover my whole c-section scar. Cutting 3/4 inch strips, the sheet should last me for 8-9 months. It sticks well. The first strip stayed on for a month, 24 hours a day, no problem."
2,Cheap Silicone patch,"I have used this patch for 4 months and the results were so-so. But the biggest headache was the flimsy, cheap silicone that rips apart very easily. Even though I applied tape to my arm at night it would peal back or break off. The patch is huge so I cut it into 2 pieces. The first piece didn't even last a month before I had to toss it from pieces braking off. I also noted that the silicone patch gets thinner over time. My hypertrophic scar on my arm was only reduced about halfway and I'm still wearing the patch...if it last?? For the $60 dollars it's just not worth it."
3,"seems to work, but too slowly for me.","I cut the gel sheet into smaller pieces because the size of my scar is small. Because the instruction says you should wash the gel sheet every 12 hours, I use two sheets at a time (one on my scar while the other one is air-dried after washing). I think the gel sheet helped with my raised scar, but at a very slow pace. I ended up going to the derm doctor and got steroid shots, and the scar was flattend within a week!"
4,"Selkirk 4"" pellet kit for high altitude","Kit came in good condition, installed easily, and has worked great with the pellet stove. One additional support bracket could have been used at the center of the stack."
4,All the insanity of Klezmer!,"This music does share the insanity of Klezmer, but it is one hell of a great jazz session. Vigor and high energy from a certifiably tight group! A three ring performance that is definitely FIVE star. It just got four as my ability to sit down and go with it is limited to four stars.Well recommended, if VERY pricey"
2,Not good eneough for the price,"There are several flaws with this item. In no particular order...1) Poor construction - two spot welds popped loose during installation2) Poor hardware - mounting screws are just a bit short3) WAY OUT OF SCALE for this series - see my review of ""Cross Creek Outdoor Wall Mount"" Had the wall mount been about 10-15% bigger, it would've been ideal. These need to be scaled down at least 33%. They are aproximately three times the size of the wall mount.Unfortunate because this is a beautiful lamp, just a bit bulbous compared to the wall variety..."
2,Great for a mail-order business,"I bought this guide by mistake. When I looked through it, I realized that it was great for a mail-order business, which I do not own. So I resold it to one of my friends who needed it for her small business."
1,not pleased,i got it and installed it properly but the compressor didnt work it was broke. im extremely disappointed by this. i was really lookung for to having it and using it. got it as a birthday present and couldnt even use it cause the compressor was broke!!!!!!!
2,"Get the previous version, which was much better!","This book is a real disappointment because it loses the benefit of the previous version (ISBN 0-19-860183-2, 1997) which had the very unique and useful 'one-stop entries' system where the dictionary and the thesaurus are described in the same entry. They are separated again in this new version which is very cumbersome to use much the same as usual dictionaries. I can hardly understand why the author has changed it this way."
3,"Ok, if you like disconnects",This wireless card works fine if you are lucky enough to have it hold a connection for more then 10 minutes. Speed is good and it does interoperate with wireless 11b networks but its habit of disconnecting often makes for a frustrating user experience. Signal strength goes from 68% to nothing and then back to 68% all of the time.
1,Stay away from this crap,"I have tried everything suggested by Netgear Tech support to fix the Code 10 error on this card. This card is compatible with my processor and OS, but tech support could not fix the code 10 issue for me. In spite of formatting my drive and re-installing win xp home, I couldnt get this card to work. My advice, stay away from this!"
3,Not everything will proceed smoothly,"Unlike other customers of this product, I had considerable difficulty installing the driver. The installation CD that came with the Wireless Card was defective and I wasn't able to use it to install the driver. Tech support was somewhat helpful - after about 40 minutes on hold/explaining the problem/trying various solutions, I was told to download the driver from Netgear's website. The woman from tech support hung up immediately after sharing this information. It wasn't obvious (to me) which file to download, and after trying three different files, my laptop recognized the driver. The irony of this situation is the hidden silver lining in this experience - in order to go online, I had to download files from the internet.After installation, I had no problems accessing the web."
1,DIFFICULT TO OPERATE,I STILL DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS PRODUCT WORKS. I CALLED NETGEAR FOR TECH HELP. I GOT A MAN WHO I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. THIS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES AND I GAVE UP.I DEO NOT KNOW WHETHER I NEED A G BASE OR NOT. SUPPORT IS VERY POOR.ROBERT CHERINIF I CAN'T GET AN ANSWER I WILL RETURN THE PRODUCT.
4,NetGear WG511,"I generally have the worse luck with wireless cards, but this on is great. It seams to be well built and sturdy and I have not had any problems with it. I would recommend this card to anyone"
1,A no-go with Windows XP and a Thinkpad,"I bought this card from Amazon about 2 months ago and unfortunately it doesn't work on my pretty modern laptop, an IBM Thinkpad T23, unless I use a 10-month-old version of the drivers (v1.6) that does not provide WPA, a feature I desperately need. Hours on the phone with Netgear's clueless offshored Bangalore help desk technicians could not solve the problem, and finally my case was escalated to someone in the USA who admitted ""There's a problem with the 2.1 drivers."" No word on when they'll actually release drivers that work, of course.I knew I should've gone with the Linksys!"
5,Work ok,No issues for use in older laptops connecting to unsecure non-encrypted systems. Not .. this will not allow you to connect to an encrypted (modern) system that prompts for a password
1,Beware! This card may not work in your computer!,"Had this card for a year and some but didn't use it much. Had occasional freezes of the computer, but didn't think it was the card.Got a wireless router as a present - and this card froze the computer multiple times. New drivers, different drivers, problems installing/uninstalling drivers, cleaning computer, reinistalling, calling tech support via email, then phone - nothing worked. Still get freezes.Netgear forums are full to the neck with tales of how this card, and other similar Netgear cards, freeze computers left, right, and center. Netgear has no response, period. Tech support has fishy tale about how a computer with too many functions on one interrupt can hang driver - but, after all this trouble, putting Linksys adapter in this computer worked as a solution with no problem.Stay away from this card, really."
4,Be careful-does NOT work with windows 98,"I bought this card in November and had to return it. The technical specs should specify Windows98SE, not just Windows 98. Check your operating system before you buy.Amazon was very good about refunding my money (less original shipping cost) even though I had opened the package and software thus the 4 stars."
1,M$ Strikes Again,"This manufacturer offers NO Linux support. A review of their support blogs indicates they don't even know enough to coach a user through ndiswrapper. Further, their postings drip with arrogance. Their suggestion for Linus users: Return the product and beg for your money back. They don't need your business. I agree. Shop elsewhere and avoid Netgear."
5,Gave life back to an old laptop,"My secondary computer is an old 2003 laptop, and when its internal wireless adapter failed to connect, I saw a cheap replacement in this card. I got it up within 5 minutes and while the speed is just standard, it gets the job done. Hopefully the card will last well into the future."
1,xp user attention !!,"Iam using xp window.. i was very frustrated when not working and spent a lot of time to fix it. however, found no way to access internet. consider buying it if using window xp.."
3,What you see may not be what you get...,"I ordered this bear as a gift precisely because of the look of the bear - a BROWN bear. What we received is a CREAM coloured bear. The bear is cute and we don't have time to exchange it so it will have to suffice. I just wanted to warn prospective buyers that if you're looking for a Brown bear, you may wish to look elsewhere."
5,HANOI ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hanoi Rocks are the greatest underground glam metal band. They have influenced several of the heavy hitters from the 1980's Guns N Roses,Warrant and Skid Row just to name a few. If you've heard of them but never heard them. They sound like a cross between early Motley Crue and early Guns N Roses. I have every cd they released including the box set and to be honest only a handful of songs are so so the rest are just killer great riffs just pure ear candy. About the DVD the concert is killer the setlist is great but to be honest they could of used a whole nother slew of songs and I would have said the same thing that's just how much they rock and they even throw a few covers in the best is ""Blitzkrieg Bop"". The concert has all the sleazy good time fun you would expect from a glam metal show. The quality of the video is very good. Long Live glam metal!"
1,Bridge functionality extremely limited,"I bought this item, because, on the back of the box, it shows the WG602 being used as a bridge to connect to a WGT624 access point. This is extremely misleading, and well, plain wrong, as a couple of other reviewers have pointed out. I was on the phone with extremely unhelpful tech support (that they outsourced to India, I believe), and it took several hours of run-around for the support guy to actually admit that the two products are not compatible (he had to ask someone else). Had he researched this properly in the beginning, hours would have been saved. I was eventually informed (after being told to upgrade firware, change numerous settings, etc.) that the WG602 would only bridge to another WG602. THE BACK OF THE BOX IS WRONG! Don't buy this if you're looking for a bridge that's compatible with any other AP."
2,Misleading feature list.,"The wireless bridging that the WG602v2 and WG602v3 of this model claim to support are only compatible with other WG602 units. In order to connect it to a WGT624 or a WGR614, I have discovered that the WGE101 is what we are all looking for. Virtually plug and play compared to the extremely misleading and frustrating experience of the 602. If properly marketed the 602 would be a quality product, but due to the extreme number of people who have misunderstood, I give this item only 2 stars."
1,Defective product and lousy technical support,"I bought this access point because it got such rave reviews for easy setup. I'm no slouch when it comes to computers, but I am no tech wiz either. This product just wouldn't work. The CD rom was defective so you couldn't access the guide. Then I could not log into the access point using the name or ip address. I had to go out and buy a special cable to connect to my computer. This I learned after 3 telephone calls to netgear with average waits on hold of 30 minutes. Then I could log on and change the settings, but found out that I had to reset all of the settings EACH time I wanted to change anything! I was told by netgear that this sometimes happens and that the product was still great. Well, it might be great, but I just returned it."
1,CHEAP.,This is a very LOW quality product. i hate it. You are better off getting a case with a built in screen cover. its very cheap and the air bubbles are impossible to get out.
1,Only a couple bucks....,"This cover only lasted about 3 days. It is made to overhang the iPod, which in turn causes it to get hung on anything and pulled off."
2,Smaller Than It Should Be,"The film itself is fine, but the area it covers is much too small. I was really hoping for more of an edge-to-edge protection that this film offers."
2,A bit disapointed.,"So, I bought this for my brand new Ipod Classic 160gb and I was way excited to finally get completely safe guarded, but unfortunatelyThe screen-protector went on okay, but the application sticker tore off leaving that sticky substance that collects dust and cat hair from a cat you dont even own.The back protector was the same, went on okay but the application sticker split in half causing the massive stickyage.And the Wheel and button sticker didn't even stick at all, there wasn't any adhesive at all on it.Really, save your money and get something else."
3,Not enought prayers.,"This book has a couple of pretty prayers but not enough for day-to-day life and that's the disappointment, I don't want to keep buying books to get needed prayers, I will go online from this point forward."
3,BURKE BOOK # 7,"Burke out of NYC and away from his running mates is like a fish out of water. I am a huge fan of Burke but in a weathly area, out of state and mourning from the last novel, well, this wasn't it for me. I will read the next one but this was weakest of the seven."
5,Tears from the truly oppressed!,"tells the true oppression of a nation of people,Slavery would of been a gift to these people! their whole culture was destroyed never to be regained!"
4,It'll definately shape your body!,"Newly obsessed with losing weight and toning my body, I bought this DVD off the recommendation of an aquaintance who had good results.This video will make you notice muscles in places you didnt know existed!The DVD does tend to run fast, but I still took it at my own pace and slowed down when I felt it appropriate.The switches in scenes make the video interesting, but Id love to see a whole video taped on the beach, as I felt the pace was more appropriate.Would definately recommend but with lots of emphasis on stretching well before and after the programs."
4,Trim and Slim,"I found this to be good workout. There was toning for the legs, arms, stomach and butt. The music was retro and fun. It make you feel like you were in a music video and working righ next to Cindy."
4,Cindy Crawford,"I love this workout video. I had it on VHS for a long time then lost it and was happy to find it DVD. It was shipped quickly, in great condition and a good price."
3,Amusing...,"I started this video and while I like the strength training, Cindy is all over the place. Her ""neck rolls"" start at her ankles... She also looks like she's got her modeling face and attitude on. I think the workout (done correctly) is pretty good."
5,Beyond Heavy!!!!!,"Blow my mind.......this CD is beyond Heavy!I have been listening to Swolen Members for some time now and this has to be one of their best collection of matieral to date! They've done an awsemone job with their lyrics, rhymes, and ""heavy"" beats. The music flows so well that you can't help yourself but nod your head.The only downfall is that the CD is so good that is almost seems too short(only 14 tracks). The Canadian release has a bonus DVD with some their music videos and behind the scene footage. I'm not sure if their U.S CD release will have the bonus DVD.You will not be disappointed when you buy Heavy."
2,Heavy,"Swollen Members are now 4 guys ( Madchild, Prevail + Moka Only and producer Rob The Viking ).This is their third full length album ( album ""Monster In The Closet"" composed of b-sides,remixes,...) and i must say, that this is the worst.I hate RnB singing vocal chorus and it is in every song.Only one track make me high - Adrenaline.Rap is still good, but beats are absolutely identical.I think, that, if you listen only instrumental version, you couldn't recognise which track is which."
2,The worst,"Swollen Members are now 4 guys ( Madchild, Prevail + Moka Only and producer Rob The Viking ).This is their third full length album ( album ""Monster In The Closet"" composed of b-sides,remixes,...) and i must say, that this is the worst.I hate RnB singing vocal chorus and it is in every song.Only one track make me high - Adrenaline.Rap is still good, but beats are absolutely identical.I think, that, if you listen only instrumental version, you couldn't recognise which track is which."
5,Durable flag poll,This flag poll is great for hanging my bigger flags for all holidays/occasions in front of my home. It can be made bigger or smaller to fit you poll holder. It's great and durable in all kinds of weather. I recommend it if you want a good poll to hold your beautiful flags.
4,Very nice metal flag pole,"The four pieces push together and then rotate to click into place but can be taken apart. The clips make it easy to get the flag on and off. The plastic end-cap at the base did come out, but this is somewhat to be expected. Will do a quick epoxy glue in and it should be good to go. The gold cap at the top is nice and appears to be affixed strongly. Time will tell if the top-cap is durable in terms of its finish. Very much worth the money paid. It's currently displaying the UA Crimson Tide flag as we approach the National Championship game."
4,Cute story,Cute story with a positive message about forgiveness and moving on. Good character developement. I also enjoyed the sex scenes. Kudos Adrienne!
1,Not worth it,"It's mostly a summary of J2EE technologies. The examples don't really start until Chapter 10.Complete waste of money--take a look at what people are willing to sell ""new"" books for in the used & new area -- not much.There's a reason for that.I'd highly recommend Enterprise JavaBeans Component Architecture by Gail Anderson & Paul Anderson instead."
5,spark plug wires,the product was correct and fit my truck exactly very happy and will buy from this person again also shipped quickly and recieved within 7 days thank you this purchase saved me over $30.00.
2,I was very dissappointed.,"After paying money for this DVD I was very disappointed it wouldn't play in my PS3 because it was in a DVD from England. So watch what you buy, don't make the same mistake that I made."
5,Great Fun for the Family,"I haven't seen the original French version, although I expect it is probably even more hilarious. The American version, is, however, enjoyable through and through. Its tongue-in-cheek quality is refreshingly different from typical Hollywood fare. Most people who enjoy good comedies would like this movie. Every minute there is something funny happening. It appeals to young and old audiences; it appeals to men and women. You get slapstick and you get romance, all delivered with just the right touch of humor. Don't miss out on this excellent film."
2,An American Knockoff of a French Original,"See the French ""Les Visiteurs."" Its far, far funnier than this lame attempt at an American re-make. The sad thing is, the original French version, with English subtitles, in NTSC format, doesn't exist, or no longer does. My library has a copy, which is how I came to see it. I understand that this may be Part 3 in a series, but it was awful and hard to watch after watching the original first. If you own a Region 0 player, then by all means buy ""Les Visiteurs."" Not this."
3,Humor Lost in Translation,"Just like Mon Pere Le Hero (My Father the Hero), Trois Hommes et un petit fille (Three Men and a Baby), Just Visiting lost some of the deep humor of its French original. However, Jean Reno and his fellow French actor save the day along with Christina Applegate. A 12th century spell goes wrong and two Frenchmen find themselves in 21st century Chicago with the nobleman's descendant helping them return to their own time. Its slapstick but like Monty Python, you have to understand the cultural nuances to get the joke."
3,Ok for a used book,"The inside of the book present some highlighting. I guess it is notmal for a used book, and luckily the highlighted parts are only in the first chapter of the book. The rest is in pretty good shape. I am overall satisfied of my purchase."
2,"UUH, weird?!","Geez?! I havenht heard the album, but listening to the samples here on amazon i gotta say NO THANX! Ill take the originals any day, also, are those real instrument? it all sound electronic, like a MIDI, or something. BLECH! Me no like this."
1,One star to many...,"Let me just say first of all how disappointed I am at all the ratings this album is receiving. It is neither clever, nor funny. It is simply one more way for these clowns to try and extort money from the few fans they have left. The days of the misfits are long gone. The sooner we let them know that, (by not buying this crap), the sooner they will go away. I thought the Misfits cell phone covers were bad enough, but now they take it a step further. This album sounds like bad 70's game show music. The lounge title falls short of being applicable. If your looking for a good ""lounge-tribute-to-metal"" album, check out Pat Boone - In a metal mood. This is just garbage. One star is to many. The Misfits have become a joke. But I'm not laughing...."
1,Jerry...Jerry. What WON'T you do?,"I loved the Danzig-era Misfits. I enjoyed the Graves-era Misfits. But now that we've been ""treated"" to filler crap like b-side/demo albums, a 1950's cover album, and now this nonsense...enough. Jeez. GET A REAL SINGER ALREADY and maybe you can retain a shred of dignity...however much dignity a 45 year old man with a balding devilock haircut can have, anyway."
2,whoa. . .,"this sounds like a ""best of misfits ringtones"" album. jerry only didn't brainchild this one did he? wow."
2,disappointing,"I wasn't expecting much, but this was still very disappointing. It was basically someone's home video, shot with a poor quality camera. I love Abaco so much, and it is so beautiful, I think I'll buy a nice camera and shoot my own video this summer!"
3,Somewhat Disappointing,I really like Oscar Peterson but I think this CD is overrated. First off I was disappointed to discover that only 5 of the 17 tracks actually feature both performers. I'm not a big fan of Joe Pass - while he's certainly a virtuoso by any measure I like him better when he slows down a bit as he did on Unforgettable. The sound quality on this recording is acceptable but nothing to write home about. The CD definitely has a few tracks that really work well but a lot of it seems very dense or showy and does not convey much feeling or emotion to me.If Oscar Peterson is the performer you're interested in I would Pass on this one - I find the classic material with his trio and some of his solo performances far more engaging than this performance.
3,Not as Helpful as it Could Be,"I was disappointed. Although it is good for very basic beginners, I was hoping it would help with functions that are more difficult. The Dummies Books are so good at explaining things in friendly terms. I was looking for the friendly terms to help me understand complicated functions. I was out of luck. I would only recomment this product for the very basic beginner."
5,This is just what I was looking for!,"We've changed over most of the lightbulbs in our home to compact fluorescents but were having trouble finding replacements for our 3 way bulbs. I ordered 3 of these and couldn't be happier. I did have to buy a new harp (the wire thing that holds the lampshade) for $1.99 at Walmart because the bulb was a fraction of an inch too high for the 8 inch harp. The light is soft and not harsh and we now have bulbs for all our 3 way lamps and are saving $$$ on energy costs.It's a year and a half later and I'm still loving these bulbs. They continue to work perfectly and I've had no complaints from other family members. (I don't think they even realized I changed the bulbs!) Along with changing all the other bulbs in the house to compact fluorescents, we're saving about $30 a month on our electric bill."
4,"Great extra TV, great price","I wanted a small TV to set beside my computer, so I could listen and occasionally watch shows while I work on my computer. I tried TV PIP on my computer, but it takes way too much of the screen real estate and I could never find a good spot to leave it. So this little TV is an great inexpensive solution. Its screen is much larger than I could have as PIP on my computer screen. And has just enough audio power to heard ok, but not drown out the computer sounds."
5,For the Price & Needed Function - Nice.,"Unit used for church as part of video/sound system (A/V booth operator's use before projection to multimedia projector & wall screen). For the function and economical price, how can you match it? Works well, adequate picture."
4,"""Aint No Thang, Brutha!!""","Watching this show as a child, i was very excited to see this show finally come on dvd. The episodes are very entertaining, but some are very topical. This is no big deal though. It is always nice to see how things were treated or portrayed in a different era. ""King of the Hill,"" ""The Box,"" and ""Yesterday Died and Tomorrow Won't Be Born"" are among my favorite episodes from the first season. I am left wondering why the 5 - 8 second opening with the picture of the ocean and the show title looping to the front of the screen was left out. This was on most of the first season episodes with the exception of ""Twenty Four Karat Kill,"" which actually had the familiar tidal wave intro with different music. Please have more updated extras. Maybe have an extra feature on ""Previews from the next episode,"" where Jack Lord says at the end of the preview, ""Be There Aloha."" Classic!!"
5,Rip Curl Anyone???,"You Can't Write a Review About Hawaii Five-O Without Mentioning Jack Lords Perfectly Quaffed Hair-do!!! I Mean We're Talking Iconic, Pop-Culturesque, to Downright AMAZING For Lack of a Better Adjective....There Has to be a Major Hole in The Ozone in Hawaii From Using All of That Hairspray, Compliments of McGarrett, Bookem Danno.......Enough of The Chicanery, Lets Get Down to Business Here...The Acting, Directing, & Writing is Topnotch!!! I Mean Compare it to The Choices we Have on TV Now....The Networks Assemble a Gaggle of Self-Absorbed Eye Candy, a Laugh Track, a Major Body Count, & Presto You Have CSI Goof-Tardville....And Then They Wonder Why People Want to Watch Reality TV...I Shouldn't be so Critical, But The Average TV Viewer Has Been Reduced to a Train Wreck Observer...The Ironic Fact is The Train Wreck We're Being Forced to Observe is Our Country, Our Standard of Living, & Society in General......."
3,Great series ---bad DVDs,"The first seasons of Hawaii Five-0 are real treasures. Conflict between good and bad and good always triumphs in a beautiful location. In the first seasons, the producers liberally used Hawaii scenes, a treat for anyone who lives in Hawaii, has ever been to Hawaii or wants to go to Hawaii.However, the product is not good. Out of one set of six discs, two have major flaws that cause the episode to black out or start to jerk midway through. Two out of six is not quality. Amazon and the distributors should be ashamed of producing such a shoddy product for what was, at the time, a top quality tv series."
1,not 15.5 inches - 2 inches off,"not 15.5 inches - 2 inches off - wasted time shipping here then returning improperly measured item, it might be worth it if you don't mind it being under 14"" wide."
5,Eternal Life,"This book a scientific revolution. It has the potential to change the paradigm of the inevitability of death. Thanks to Leonard Orr`s research you are invited to follow his path of spiritual purification. This leads you to a new experience of Life. A Life full of joy, happiness, laughter and of course: Energy. Rebirthing is more then a technique, it is a philosophy of how to transform body, mind and spirit by the elements of earth, air, water, fire, loving community and repeating a holy mantra - the devotion to good. Leonard says, that breathing in a hot tub is the most deepest meditation he ever experienced. And it is relaxing of course. Were relaxation exists, disease has no place to settle... So stress-management is the art of no management. Let the breath do the work... It`s a great book. Learn about the mystery and mastery of transfiguration and experience the hidden treasure... First step to eternal life is buying!"
1,WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY ALL 3 TOGETHER AND PAY MORE,"Let's see. What kind of person would buy all 3 of the first three seasons of The Andy Griffith show and pay $10 to as much as $32 more than buying them indidvidually? Not me!!!!!! Call me crazy, call me stupid, but shouldn't we get a price break for this, not an increase? It's like going to the grocery store and buying a gallon of milk for $3.00 and getting 3 for $12.00. At one point they were selling seasons 1 & 2 for $23.39 each and season 3 for 29.24. That is a total of $76.02 for all three. However they are selling the 3 pack for $107.99 for a difference of $31.97. And don""t think you get anything extra by buying all three together. You don't. I guess they must think some people can't do simple math or do not care if they throw away good money."
5,Awesome,"Well, Ive got quite a lot of Oscar petersons Live Cd's and this one Is definetly the best one, Great solos and pretty long too more than 90 minutes, So worth the buy"
5,Best microfiber out there,"I have been using Mystic Maid cleaning cloths for 4 years now, and occasionally try out another brand that's cheaper. There's no comparison. Just a little water and these cloths get up grease, lint, soap scum, fingerprints, everything. I've almost completely stopped using cleaning solutions - a little bleach in the toilet bowl - and use my Mystic Maid cloths and water. It's so great to think of all the chemicals I'm not adding to our water system and planet - and my house (glass, counters, woodwork, tile, everything) is clean. I give these away as gifts and my friends look at me funny, and then they thank me later.PS They pick the pet hair up off my upholstery, too. Amazing."
2,Good book but LOTS of mistakes,The book is good & inspiring BUT I found too many grammar mistakes & misspelled words (which makes me wonder... was it ever revised or read???)That is why I ranked it low -- how can you publish a book with sooooo many mistakes????
1,Stolen Title and cover?,"I give this 1 star because I believe copying the title of another so closely is bad Karma.I have NOT read this book, but found it while searching for ""When you can walk on water, take the boat""...published by John Harricharan over a decade before this... Title, font, pictures.. all way too similar.John, a friend of Deepak Chopra and spiritual great, wrote a life changing book for many of us and I was saddened to see this book title here.Shame on the author and reader beware,,,what could come of something that is created on deceit? What energies will this attract into the readers life."
1,ick,"Maybe I got a bad batch but this stuff is just gross. Smells more like bug spray than anything else. And the bottle is cheap as well, trying to get the top off made the little ""gems"" around the neck break off.I like the Goddess perfume (in the pink bottle) but Golden Goddess is a real stinker."
3,ups and downs of ella and jobim,"the translation from portuguese to english was very good considering the constrictions that music hands to translating. but the musical interpretations of jobim's works are a little too off the wall for me. the music didn't carry the same feel that jobim had originally given it. i grant the musician license, but there was too much taken, because i couldn't recognize these jobim classics.oh-it is hard to sing in another language when you don't know how to speak it. but ella is way off right here on pronunciation. it wasn't too impressive."
3,Strange cd!,"This cd contains 9 songs from the 'Twist And Shout' sessions, unspectacularly remastered in mono BUT... the 10th and final song on here 'I Need Your Love', is from an obscure and long lost single by the Impressions (without Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield). The featured lead singer is Richard or Arthur Brooks with the rest of the Impressions singing background. This recording is a real rarity. I once owned this record as a 45 rpm record which came out in the late 50's. How this song got mislabeled and credited to the Isley Brothers is a real mystery. Although poorly remastered, all of the music itself is good."
4,Good book,"I bought this because my 2 year old daughter loves chick chicka boom boom abcs, however, numbers will have to come at a later date."
5,My toddler loves it,"My 18mth old loves the ryhmes and the way the book has a suprise ending...she claps everytime I say, "" 0 is hero of the number tree."""
4,Magnificent but butchered on CD...,"This recording is one of Gillespie's essentials of course. Sadly the label, in order to avoid to issue it in 2-CDs, edited the originally 20-minute track ""Olinga"" down to 11:25... So, we still need the 2-record set on vinyl."
3,A Little Disappointed,"Although I'm glad I bought this first season package of ""Bosom Buddies"", I am a little disappointed that it's not quite as I remember. Firstly, the opening theme song is not ""My Life"" by Billy Joel. It's something else entirely. Also, one of my favorite episodes (where Kip and Henry go to Ruth's apartment) was not complete. The part where they're all singing the Calypso song is not in it. That scene was hilarious. Makes me wonder how many episodes they have chopped up. I guess, in the long run, it's better to have some of Bosom Buddies as opposed to none of them."
1,I Knew It!!!!!,"I have been reading the reviews, having not yet purchased the product and I have officially changed my mind about buying it. Who's fault is this anyway? Billy Joel's? Paramount? Tom Hanks? This is ridiculous. Anyone who spends the money, should have the original product, complete, intact!How many episodes of 'Friends' were edited? (Uh, none!) Original theme song, annoying as ever. I consider myself, a 'Bosom Buddies' expert! I actually purchased some 'pirated' copies from Canada (did not know this at the time) and I will stick with them, commercials and all, plus the original theme song. If they could use the Billy Joel song in reruns, they could put it on the videos. Oh, and the cover is absolutely horrible. Very disappointed and to repeat what others have all ready said, shame, shame, NOT COOL!"
4,Worth a careful reading...,"Since I'd often seen this work cited in other writings (economics), I wanted to read it first hand. Glad I did.Weber himself was not taking sides religiously, just observing what he considered the facts of the case of the religious roots of America's booming capitalism, written when the US was emerging as a serious world power. Though by no means a deep dive into theology, Weber digs into an explanation of Protestant doctrine to make his point. Each reader will draw his own conclusions, but one cannot dispute the thoroughness and documentation of Weber's analysis.Not an easy read, but worth it if you want to better appreciate what made this country great."
4,Slowhand is still slowhand,"I've also the previous Crossroad DVD....this new one is a good stuff.The price is ok, enough speedy the shipment."
4,Crossroad's 2007: NO J. J. CALE?,"I liked most of the show, not as well as 2004. But J.J. Cale did a 5 song part with Eric and it was cut. Will a 2nd edition be in the making? From what I have seen of the reviews it looks as if it could be possible."
5,One of the best sounding video.,"Eric has put together a bunch of great musicians and they all sound great with classic tunes, but by far, Steve Winwood is the highlight in this vid for me.It also sounds great with surround sound and a strong sub woofer to bring out the bass, highly recommended video for those who loves classic rock."
3,not as good as Dallas,"For me, as much as I liked Bill Murray in SNL and his movies, I was feeling like this was his event instead of Clapton's. Murray was more of a waste of film footage as he introduced guests and met them back stage. The act that blew me away was the bass guitar player for Jeff Beck. Tal was amazing! My advice to Clapton and the producers is to take it back to Dallas without Murray and recapture that magic. Dump Bill Murray and this would have been rated rated higher by me."
4,Sizzling Bridgeport Illinois,Great music from the most talented in the business. I never need an excuse to hear all of these great people together on the same stage.
5,Eric Clapton's Crossroads Concert,Great DVD and very pleased withe the price and quality of this used product from Amazon.
1,Incomplete,The show was amazing. All of it. From beginning to end. So why not package all of it and sell it? I would then buy it.
5,Love 'em,"My previous strainers were a set of three purchased for $20. Yuck! I'm so glad I upgraded to these strainers. I'm a little miffed because my set of three cost $100. I have the 5"", 7"" and 9"". I would have loved to get the 3"" too.At any rate, these live up to the famous All-Clad quality. They are heavy for their size and absolutely beautiful. I tried to press the wire mesh inward and it was very difficult to do so. The wire presses in very easily on my previous set. The mesh on these is actually stronger than the mesh on my colanders!These are dishwasher safe (my two favorite words). If your strainers get a lot of use, consider this set. It is worth the price."
2,try to buy another one!!,"i will tell you why ... it sucks battery like a beast, and doesn't have radio... you could find somethig with radio at the same price"
3,Very basic,I purchased 4 of these for my kids. They are very basic with nothing fancy but my kids love them. No fancy options and must have USB 2.0 to use or it has problems. Not recommended for the high end user but ok otherwise. You get what you pay for. Don't use disk unless you have windows 98 or ME.
2,broken leg,The corner nook looks nice but when we were putting it together the end leg on the small bench side has multiple cracks through it. We have left messages with the company and no one has gotten back to us. So much for customer service.
5,Tried and True,I've been using the Bioelements Multitask Eye Cream for about a year. I wouldn't go without it now. Moisturizes beautifully without being greasy. Another great product from Bioelements. I believe it's worth the price and would recommend this to anyone looking to improve the look of those fine lines around the eye area.
1,JUNK,"Thank you ATI1981 and DUANE, I almost made a terrible mistake. In a rush to purchase replacement cookie sheets, I was about to add these to my cart without noticing they were manufactured by WILTON. Duane, I'm so glad you mentioned the manufacturer in your review. I just tossed my second Wilton in the trash. They warp, they rust, juices spill in the oven. I'll never knowingly purchase this product again. A piece of junk and a waste of money."
3,Warped on First Use,"I bought this set after having it on my list on long time and was so excited to finally have some decent cookie sheets. Well, after hoping the other buyers' reviews who mentioned warping were a ""fluke"" ... it is not. I used the smallest sheet the night I got it to heat a frozn dinner at 350 degrees and within moments I heard the same ""pop"" as the other reviewer, turned on my oven light, and saw it had warped virtually immediately. (At only 350 degrees!) So, the small one no longer lies flat and I am very disappointed. (I do not hold out much hope for the other two now.) I was glad to feel the ""weight"" of them (it's even mentioned on the packaing), assuming they would hold up well, but now I am very dubious about this brand's supposed quality."
4,Anti-Glare Protector,"This sounds like a good product but was very difficult to remove from packaging to place onto my phone screen. I ended up dropping it on the floor and dirt stuck all over it. So, I tried to wash it, as it says it is washable, and that did not work at all. The sticky film simply smudged all over it and created a mess.If you can get it TO your phone, it will work great."
2,The Dragonriders of Pern,This is boring. I am still reading this book. They never resolve a problem just keep adding more. Very frustrating.
5,Dragonriders of Pern,I have always been a McCaffrey fan and buy her books as soon as they hit the shelf. I loved The White Dragon for its sensitivity in developing the main characters. McCaffrey's character have a lot of depth and you begin to think of them as friends after a while.
1,It was like having my teeth pulled,"I read this book based off of some of the other reviews. I went through and read the entire series hoping it would get better. Each story is formulaic and predictable with no real action. Essentially this is a series about politics with dragons thrown in. I read all genre's and this was just horrible with sci-fi being my favorite. There was nothing to make me care about the characters and the world was not interesting enough to pull me into it. I'm sorry to those who seem to love this series, but I found nothing remotely redeemable about it, and have actually told several people how much I disliked this entire series."
3,"Good when you are younger, sliding down to bland","I read my first Pern book when I was 10. It was The White Dragon. I thought it was fantastic and since then I have read all the Pern books, except the newest one, whatever it's called. I think this series has gone on too long. When you start writing books about the Masterharper that have nothing to do with dragons... Lessa seems a little cruel to me, and my favourite characters are Jaxom and F'lar. Unfortunately, these books have a certain sense of ""Oh no we have a problem"" and then 5 minutes later it's fixed with no effort from the characters at all. I would love to have a dragon though."
3,Interesting,"While I enjoyed this trilogy, it's just a bit too packaged and tied up neatly with a bow for me to allow more than 3 stars. You will identify with the characters and you will become involved in the tense moments, but it's just a tad too juvenile if you've read much of this genre.I'm having trouble criticizing it because it is satisfying in a way, but it just didn't stay with me. I didn't think about it after the fact, and that, to me, is the defining quality of a truly excellent series.Would I recommend reading it? Yes, it's worth the time. Is it great? No, it's good.I tend to judge this and related genre's against the Heinlein, Asimov and George R. R. Martin's of the world and it comes up short. Perhaps that's unfair, but so be it.You won't waste your time, but don't expect to be awed."
3,For collectors,"I ordered the product and sadly had to resend it because the game, though interesting, it's literally in Japanese. It's a great game espacially for collectors, I believe that if your a huge Yugioh! fan, and is a Japan freak you would loove this game. It also does include the package of Yugioh! cards like promised neetly sealed and the package is in perfect condition. Game Zone is also good in a Client and Entrepenuer relationship, I mean wow, thanks guys I really appreciate your time and patience."
3,Creative Jack The Ripper theory!,"I felt this was a creative, fly by the seat of your pants theory, that was just as good as anyone else's guess. It's great!"
3,If Only There Could Be Less Sodium,"Tone'sTone's Spices (Spice Advice) Spicy Spaghetti Seasoning (* Zesty Italian Pasta Blend 14 oz)is one of our favorites. We used it in developing the recipes in The Collard Patch. We like the coarse blend of onions, garlic, spices, red and green bell peppers, and crushed hot red peppers. This delicious, spicy mix makes great pasta sauce and helps season collard greens.The first ingredient listed is salt. A two-teaspoon serving supplies almost one fourth the salt that a young healthy person needs in a day's time. As we mature, we need to cut back on our sodium to avoid that silent killer, hypertension. If we weren't concerned that it would run our blood pressure up, we would eat more of it.If only there could be less sodium, we could enjoy it more often!"
3,Compared to Ghost's other cd's,"The first song on this cd alone is enough to buy the album.Ghostface actually beat Rakim on this one.Whoa!No Ghostface cd is bad, none.This one was not his best and to me was at the bottom of his catalogue. His rhymes are on point, some of the beats are not clear and sound distorted--too much is going on with the beats.It is his crew that ruins this cd, too many guests. I liked the way he released the cd though. You have to remember this cd was released like 6 months after Fishscale and to that it's pretty good. Too many good songs to not put an album out, too few good songs for this cd to be better than any of his other cd's."
5,asdf,"hardcore classic... nuffsaid!mad lyrics, mad production and although ghostface is a bit skant (absent) on a few tracks, when he does appear, the results are golden... this is one of the few releases that will always be a template of commercial, yet still hardcore...peace,"
2,I Can't Believe I watched the Whole Thing,"A very beautiful locale and that was it. Around the 3rd or 4th time Jolie enters a room (which seems to happen every 15 mins or so) and watching everyting come to a halt as men, women, musicians, dogs, cats and artwork stop to ogle her, it just became silly. The plot twist (if that is what you would call it) made me think ok, that's great, but who cares?I really can't say anymore, I have wasted enough time with this film already."
2,too horrible for words,"I adore Johnny Depp and like Angelina Jolie very much. But this movie is beyond bad. Johnny looks like he just came out of a stint in re-hab. It's beyond comprehension how he could look so BAD. There is absolutely no chemistry between he and Jolie and what very little dialog there is, is stilted, boring and banal. I laughed at the ""boat chase"" because the music lent an air of adventure and urgency but the boats appeared to be chugging along at 10 mph. Absolutely nothing interesting, exciting or romantic about this movie. Skip it and go watch a pot boil. It will be a better use of your time."
2,Very Disappointing.,"Dont waste your money, this movie is a yawner, Angelina is basically walking around Venice looking sexy. Depp done a fine job but the roll he played could have been played easily by any actor with decent looks. Very slow movie all the way until the last ten minutes. Save your money. I wouldnt even reccomend renting this much less buying it."
2,Big yawn...,"Average at best. Nice cinematography alone does not do the trick. The few action scenes felt like slow motion. If you like to watch Jolie or Depp, this may be something for you. Otherwise, do not waste your time."
3,Really slow,"I was expecting a fast-paced thriller, but this was really slow! The ""surprise"" twist at the end was also too obvious. So while it is a fun movie with beautiful photography, the plot was disappointing."
4,Great movie!,"Great movie. I don't know why people rate this movie so low. It's a good movie with a twist at the end, it keeps you guessing! Would definitely watch again. :)"
4,Good Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie quite alot because it has action, it's funny and has a little romance too. This is the 1st movie I have seen with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp together and I enjoyed the easy way they interacted with each other in this movie. They were a perfect fit for the stars."
2,Venice looked great,"Not much else looked great in this movie. I had an intense desire to wash Angelina's face and I thought I wasgoing to scream with all the posturing and posing that took place. Do people (even) guys really get turned on by that.I find it amazing. It was boring. Far too slow. The plot was in no way intriguing. But Venice is beautiful. Mademe want to go back. If I ever watch this again, I will turn off the sound, try to avoid those horrible dark eyelashesof Angelina's and just look for the scenery."
2,Lost potential,"This movie had all the right ingredients: All star cast, good plot, great location. Some how the result was less than spectacular. That is 103 minutes of my life that I will never get back."
5,The Tourist,"A nice addition to my Johnny Depp dvd collection. This is different from his recent movies and allows one to see Johnny Depp as well as his character. He and Anjelina Jolie play well off each other and though there is a lot of action, it is not overdone and does not take away from the story. Lovely setting, Venice and a well made film. The rest of the cast are also very good in their portrayals."
4,Can wait to see this again!,"Loved this movie! Finally, a movie without a lot of unnecessary sexual content and blood and guts. Instead a good plot that keeps you interested and guessing what comes next. Angelina was her usual beautiful mysterious character and it was fun to see yet another side of Johnny Depp."
1,Terrible,"This was so bad, I don't know where to start. Depp was heinous, Jolie just gave looks, seriously, giving looks was how she acted the part. Don't waste your time"
2,I'm Not Following...,"The Tourist was one of those movies for me that I kept thinking to myself through most of the entirety of the film, ""What in the world is going on here?"". And because of that, it was a movie I had to finish to find out what happened or else it would drive me crazy. I gave it two stars because the colors and pictures were stunning - especially of Venice (I also adored Elise's wardrobe). Unfortunately though, I don't know how this was nominated for so many awards... maybe just because of famous actors? Who knows. If you must watch this film, do so if only to enjoy a great wardrobe and very high quality pictures."
2,Very Predictable....,"When I got dragged to see this in theatres, the one bright spot i kept telling myself was depp is a good actor and he is, well most of the time, in very good movies. In the very least, one that makes you think....For this Movie, that was not the case. It was well-acted, the scenery was great, but it was very obvious how it was gonna end in the first 30 mins."
1,Prepare to be BORED!,"I will keep this short. Angelina's character was horrible. She barely spoke the entire movie. When she did, she was so monotone that it drove me and my friend's crazy. The storyline was bad and very predictable. Depp is definitely forgettable in this film as well. I never saw the original film but it doesn't matter. IT'S BAD!"
5,The Sitcom is Back!,"I was very fearful after Everybody Loves Raymond and Friends went off the air that the demise of the sitcom was near. It's NOT!! Brad Garrett and Joely Fisher bring magic and wit back to the screen with 'Til Death. Brad somehow manages to bring a brand new character with all the old ""lovability"" and charm of his old character (Robert - Everybody Loves Raymond). I've never had the privilege to see Joely Fisher act before - but she will win you over! The chemistry between the two is hard to miss. The Woodcocks (Eddie Kaye Thomas and Kat Foster) also are easy to become addicted to. In the second season, Kat Foster brings a hilarious side to her character. I look forward to Wednesday nights!!!!"
5,Now there's no excuse for not learning .NET,"Having concentrated on Java for several years, I procrastinated switching gears in order to come up to speed on .NET. It turns out to be simpler than I thought, at least when you have this book.The author calls out every major feature and system of Java, comparing and contrasting its analogue on the .NET platform. His explanations are concise and the examples are very clear--so clear, in fact, I found he even answered lingering Java questions for me. Paul Gibbons leverages the many patterns familiar to all Java programmers, making .NET very approachable (and much more concrete).This book seems to spring from the author's own practical experience, which makes it that much more valuable to a ""working programmer."" I highly recommend this book for anyone faced with learning .NET, but especially those who know Java. Their experience, combined with this book, will make the process a breeze."
2,Not worth it.,this product was cheaply made and not enough resistance. i had an original thighmaster for many years but it finally broke so i thought i'd try this one. i ended up sending it back even though the postage fees hardly made it worth the effort. don't bother!
2,Not sure about this one..,I thought I would like this gadget and it would be easy to operate.. I'm not sure of its effectiveness because after trying it I realized it wasn't for me.
3,not great,"I don't know what product is better because this is the only purchase I've made of something like this, but this one is hard to use. It is extremely hard to keep in place. The resistance is decent. The plastic covering the spring comes apart."
1,i wish i had never bought this,"1st. strong strong strong rubber smell that goes on my pants and skin; smell lasts a long time even after i washed my hands. left it alone for months, came back to it; strong strong rubber smell still there2nd. this is very loose compare to other thigh shaper; not tense enough to shape legs. like a grandma/ wanabe thigh shaper3nd. i paid 11 bucks and my friend got a very good thigh shaper w no rubber smell at half of the price i paid.do not buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't buy this item!!,"This is a piece of garbage. I just got this in the mail today. I want to send it back, but I'll have to pay more money just to return it. And I won't be reimbursed the initial shipping fee. This is the most cheap and doesn't work piece of garbage I ever ordered. This ""thigh toner"" is flimsy and in no way can one excerise with this without having to make constant adjustment to hold it in place. GARBAGE!! This get's zero stars."
3,Easy to Use,"This is easy to use and doesn't require a lot of effort besides picking it up and actually using it. One thing I did find is that the blue cover on it has started to crack open and sometimes I feel like the black ball part at the top is going to break apart. I've had this item for a few weeks. I find it's better to use for my arms than it is for my legs, think it will last longer that way."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"Wow!I just received this thigh toner and took it out of the box. I thought it was broken, but, on second thought, that is just how it comes - cheap and flimsy. It is basically a thick wire hangar covered in foam, with a flimsy spring inside the center black plastic cover, which pops off easily.It doesn't have much tension and I don't recommend buying it, even for the cheap price. I'd say it is worth around $1.99 at most. I'm sure there are sturdier and better designed products."
3,fitness,I like it but it doesn't have enough cushion on it. I'm trying to build up my thighs after surgery and I have to put my hands between it and my thighs.
2,Awkward,This thigh master is not the best to use at all. It is difficult to find the right position to be in to get the best out of its use. Not that great of a purchase at all.
1,Uncomfortable,"You get what you pay for. When you try it out, it never stays in place. It it difficult to find a comfortable position to use it when it won't even stay in place."
2,Not what I expected,The thigh toner is very uncomfortable to use. I also thought it would be more sturdy.
2,"Beautiful, but...","The money clip is very attractive but too heavy for practical use. Twice I gave it away to people that are over 6'5"" tall thinking they may feel more comfortable with it. Not so. They gave it back after a few weeks. It now occupies 'jewelry box' space."
5,Wow Oh Wow,"This is a really great video. BUT watch it all the way through first, then go back and work along with her section by section. I didn't watch all the way through and ironed when I shouldn't have and it did make a difference. But well done video that a beginner can understand."
2,You get what you pay for,"I liked this item at first. It looks nice and I got alot of compliments on it. The problem is...It doesn't fit the phone well. What is the point of have a leather case on your phone that keeps falling off??? I can't complain because it was so cheap. right now the case is in the arm rest of my car the last time it fell off, I just said forget it!"
1,it was a good thought.,"This may work for your kid but didn't for ours. We had a great first time with it as she would stay on the spot and seemed to grasp it was a time out. Then after the 2nd time, it became a Frisbee or something she just refused to sit on. This has been brought out a few more times but it is not received well. We had just resorted to telling her where to sit for a time out now. It was a nice thought but ultimately a waste."
5,Helpful for toddler meltdowns!,"If you use ""time-out"" as a method to deal with your toddler, this is a helpful product because it's portable. The portablity allows you to use the mat outside the home and ensures consistency when using time out since the child is used the mat."
2,Slippery,"The top of this mat is so soft it's almost silky. When we leave it on the floor in its spot, it is a hazard for anyone walking by - adults as well as my 1 year old baby."
5,Take-Out Time-Out Out of this World!,"I had to rate the ""fun"" level of this ""toy"" as low, because my 11-year-old special needs daughter didn't think it was very much fun. Overall, though, this is a wonderful tool for parents - at home or away! It's a very visual reminder that the child is being disciplined and every time we bring it out now, our daughter protests that she'll do better. Even our 15-month-old granddaughter recognizes it for what it is. Yet it folds up small enough to fit in a purse or diaper bag! These are going to become my favorite shower gift!"
3,Comparing the 5 disc set to the 4 disc set.,"I won't go into details about what happened in season 6 as others have done that so well. To those who are trying to decide on whether to buy this set on Amazon, I say, pass on it and get the 5 DVD set from Discovery channel. The 5 DVD set contains the complete After the Catch show on disc 5, while the 4 DVD set sold here eliminates it. The rest of the content on the two sets is identical. Spend the few extra bucks and get the 5 disc set from Discovery Channel (it's on sale now at 40% off). One final nit- picking point....they could have at least put Captain Phil Harris on the cover. He had contributed so much to the show and his sad passing on this last season made it the highest rated show on the Discovery Channel. Putting him on the cover would have been the classy thing to do."
3,The microscope does not work well,"The rest of the kit is great with lots of things for kids to do, but we can't see anything with the microscope. Either I am not doing something right, or it is not very good. There are really no instructions for that part. We are pretty frustrated this morning because it is a big part of this toy."
3,CSI Review,"After the kit was purchased, there was a recall about asbestos in the fingerprint part of the kit - I don't know if this applied to this set or not. The shipping charges were entirely too high."
1,Doesn't support Win2K or XP,"Buyer beware: This product doesn't support anything past Win 95 or Win 98, maybe even ME (not sure about the latter -- doesn't say anything on the box). Checking their driver site, they don't have any drivers online either, and don't seem interested in producing any (at least based on the silence).I have to say, it was a disappointment to me that they aren't supporting anything more modern."
5,Adorable,"I LOVE this book, and I LOVE the illustrations. I loved how endearing the story is, and reminded me of how the family gets together for wine and food to celebrate the addition of a new family member on their actual birth day. The illustrations are beautiful, I'm not a big fan of some of the 'cheesy' illustrations that seem so popular in kid's books, I wanted something I could gift my neice and could stay a part of her library forever - and I feel like this one hits the spot!"
5,"wonderful, wonderful","This is a heavenly book, and my daughter just loved it when she opened it for her little six-month-old cherub."
5,Every child should be read this book,"What a wonderful book! Every child needs to be read this book, slowly so the words sink in. They need to know that they are loved and special. I am a new grandma, my granddaughters are ages 3 and 4, they will be read this book over and over again.thank you Ms. Tillman"
5,On The Night You Were Born,"This is a beautifully illustrated book. I think this is so important for children's books. It also reminds us all how our uniqueness brings something into the world that no one else can bring. I gave this as a ""new baby"" gift for one of my grandchildren's parents. They loved it."
5,Just wonderful.,I'm not sure there is any point in adding another 5 star review for this wonderful book but both of my kids enjoy it and it makes this curmudgeonly old daddy tear up.
5,Dancing Bears,My husband and I gave this book to our great-niece for her 1st birthday. It quickly became her favorite bedtime story. She likes to dance with the bears when she goes to get the book for her parents to read.We had read the book before purchasing it. The story perfectly fit the celebration of her birth.K & J ZielinskiOn the Night You Were Born
5,"Easy to use, easy to carry","This book, and its companion on the Shrubs of New Jersey, is easy to put in your pocket or pack and take with you when you go to the woods. The most commonly found shrubs and vines are briefly described and their leaves, flowers, or fruits are illustrated, so that anyone can identify them by matching the leaf to the page. This book is great for classes and field trips. I only wish that it was easier to find in stores."
3,Shop Around,"I'm totally in favor of saving energy and the environment using compact fluorescent bulbs, but I can't recommend this particular one. It supposedly delivers the lumens of a150 watt bulb, which is a lot for a compact florescent, but unfortunately, I found this 40 watt model only slightly brighter than the 23 watt models (100 equivalent) from GE and Sylvania. Also, it is very large -- it wouldn't fit in two of my standard lamps. It is a compact, but you need to look for a compact ""mini twist"" to fit a typical living room lamp with a shade. Also, the light is rather yellow, even for a compact florescent. So far I have been most happy with Sylvania and GE products. I would try those first."
3,sticky price tag hard to get off.,it really took us a while to get the sticky price tag off the center if the key chain! it allmost distroyed the key chain.
2,"Worth what I paid, which wasn't much.","I purchased these to use with my new dremel 200. I received them in a cheaply made plastic box, in which 6 or the bits were loose. The box doesn't hold them in place well, so I purchased a new case for them. No big deal there. Four of the bits were bent upon arrival.I was also sorely disappointed at how quickly they wore down. I did a small engraving on a glass drinking cup, and went through 3 of the bits to do so! I thought I had gotten a good deal, but quickly realized I got exactly what I paid for. They barely engraved glass or stone, and wore down after only a few minutes of use. If you're planning on using these on softer materials, they might get the job done. However, A quality diamond burr tip should have no problem with glass or stone. I will NOT be recommending these to anyone. Unbelievably cheaply made."
2,You get what you pay for ! I keep learning that lesson,I would get a better set these are really cheap in a very bad cheap plastic container that doesn't even hold them in place when I opened box they all had come loose it was a nightmare. They fad fast unless your cutting air
4,Great Price for as many pieces as you get,Works great with all my dremel tools. Can do a lot of different etching and engraving with this set at a very affordable price. Wear a little fast but at the price you can order another set without being out a lot of money.
3,Useful tips,"Okay for the price, although the ones I've used look like they're going to dull rather quickly. Made in China, so not surprising."
3,diamond set,"I have not had a chance to utilize this product to its fullest yet, but what I have done with it, it has performed well."
5,Still Valuable Semi-Introduction,"If you are looking for a concise overview of Old Testament theology from a conservative Protestant perspective, this book by William Dyrness might fit the bill. Dyrness discusses the material thematically, with attention paid to the historical progression of various concepts. The approach is quite conservative, particularly as concerning the dating of texts, sources, and the like.I should mention that this book presupposes a fair amount of knowledge of the history of ancient Israel as well as theology, so it isn't for those lacking a basic knowledge of these subjects. The book was published in the late 70s, making it a bit dated, but the subject matter is, as they say, timeless."
4,Thi s a great book!!,I use this book my then any other Amish Dutch dictionary I have purchased. It is closest to their language!!
4,"it'll satisfy your curiosity about the man, but won't do much more","I don't think history is going to be very kind to this movie.I mean, the guy had a way of saying the f-word with a certain panache, and this warrants legions of fans, a documentary, a Wikipedia page, etc.?What was interesting was that, when actually given an audience, when an actual filmmaker came up and said ""Here's a mike . . . what would you like to say to the world,"" the man just had more incoherent, gratuitous imprecations.Still: I took a sober lesson from this movie. Take care of your marriage, and your spouse. Do everything you can to make it work. Because being old, ill, and alone with nothing but an ugly dog by your side . . . well, that's the worst thing that can happen to you."
4,Ken Ishii - Misprogrammed Day (Remixes),"Ken Ishii's ""Misprogrammed Day"" comes off his _Sleeping Madness_ album, and it's a like a brand new silver dollar: bright, shiny and smoothly metallic. DJ Q, best known for his house output, manages to handle the ""tech"" part of the equation quite nicely, laying down some long tones and some high-pitched bleepery. Dave Angel offers his well-established talent for melodic tech-house, and Afronaught lays down some broken beats for it's funk-tinged mix. Proper."
1,"ACTUALLY I ordered it dec 15th, and im still waiting...","maybe someday before the artist is dead, i will own this cd."
1,stinks - terrible,"very few of the songs are on the show. I read in small print on the CD case, ""SONGS INSPIRED BY THE SHOW"" which mean nothing.The songs are not enjoyable or fun. My son was not interested at all. I didnt like it. The CD has been put into the trash."
5,Compassion in the Workplace,"Finley and Robbins come to grips with the most fundamental question, how can we continue to cooperate in a predatory economy even when we're on the same team. Everyone who works with others will find something useful here."
3,Loose lid,"Great for the price, it was the right size (as described) however the lid is a little loose, not a problem if you don't carry it by the handle."
2,A little too Brokeback Mountain for my taste,"The beginning of this book was promising, but then it hit a plateau and didn't go anywhere.My biggest complaint would be the heroine's character, Reb. She was a tomboy to the extreme and not the least bit ladylike. The entire story took on a ""Brokeback"" feel. In fact, the hero believed Reb was a boy for more than half of the time they were aquainted.It was an odd story that was all over the place with a handful of subplots as well. I don't recommend."
3,Strangely amusing!,"This was an innocent, pleasant western yarn about a wounded man saved by a 'young boy' from marauding Indians. Nice story, fairly exciting, predictable, feel good ending. Worth the time to read."
1,A Major Disappointment.,"I really tried to like this book.As a populist I was expecting something better than what I read in this book.Are there some excellent profiles on American figures and their populist views?Yes. And some extremely good material like quotations from Senator Robert Taft, Thomas Jefferson, H.L.Mencken, and Senator Bob LaFollette to list just four of the many leaders cited.What ruined the book for me was the racist views aired over and over throughout this book!I give it one star and no recommendation.It's too bad because the title and subject held a lot of promise on a subject even more relevant today."
1,meh,I just could not get into this book at all.. I tried and kept going back to it but somethung just didnt grab me
4,Kudos to Ms. Rice,"Well, it seems reviews are mixed on this one. Coming from a long time Luanne Rice fan who has read everything (from her very first novel) she's written, I thought this was a pretty good book. Not her best, but one of her more recent that I enjoyed (more than others like (Beach Girls, Silver Bells).Personally I enjoyed the story, even if it frustrated me at times to how John dealt with his being accused of murder. And of course how Honor subsequently treated him. I guess even how the girls dealt with it at times. BUT, I thought the plot was a good one, it kept me hooked until the last page. Also Bernie & Tom made great ""side characters"". I found them all loveable.Overall I'd recommend Rice's earlier works like Cloud 9, Safe Harbour, Summer Light, Secret Hour, Dance with Me, & Firefly Beach. However, I think like most authors as we read through their long catalogue, sometimes our tastes change, or as we begin to know the ""formula writing"", interest wains. But for me, NOT YET."
2,Good for Insomnia,"What a boring book! I have read several Luanne Rice books, and I fear she is going downhill lately, like some other authors I like. The story was so boring, and the twist at the end was like ""Oh yea, oh well."" Then you think something good will happen for Sister Bernie and Tom and, nope, don't get too interested in that storyline. That will leave you hanging too!I still think she's a good author - this was just a boring book. I'm not ready to give up on Luanne Rice yet!"
3,small but efficient,"this oven is extremely small...when they say two slices of bread that is what they mean...cant be used for pizza or anything larger than a slice of bread..it doesnt get too hot and takes a while to complete even the smallest task..this product is functional but just meant for small,quick jobs"
1,Dead in 8 months,"Liked the simplicity and small size of this toaster oven, and used it regularly. But then the heating elements suddenly just stopped working."
2,It does the job,It doesn't have a temperature dial so you don't have that much control over how things are cooked. It feels like I'm using an easy bake oven instead of a toaster oven. The timer only goes up to 15minutes. I would have gotten one a little more expensive if I had known it was basically a light bulb in a metal box.
2,Too small for much use,The toaster oven works fine for something like frozen waffles and thin toast. I had the problem that anything larger than that would just get burned for being too close to the top heating coil. The oven is very small and bagels would also be charred at the top.
4,Love this!,"...little toaster oven. We live in an RV, so I don't have much counter space. Most 4-slice toaster ovens are too deep, so I can't open the door all the way. Even the toaster oven with the slide up door had too large a footprint for my counter space. This little baby is perfect. Its only defect is being too shallow to bake a potato, say. I toast bread and sliced bagels. I toast sandwiches with ham slices on one piece of bread and cheese on the other piece. I can bake refrigerator cookies too."
1,Defective Box Set,"I too have had problems with several discs skipping or stopping in various places on the movies. Has anyone contacted Fox about this? This is the second box set I have got and both have been defective, in exactly the same spots. I am using a Denon DVD-2900 which has played hundreds of movies flawlessly, this is the first defective DVD I have ever had. The problem is only when watching Alien or Alien Resurrection when using the DTS soundtrack. If you watch either of these films using Dolby Digital soundtrack they play flawlessly."
4,It was worth it for any Sci Fi fan.,"The movies were all good, I have yet to watch the bonus features, but the quality was good. I highly recommend this product for anyone interested in the series if you have not seen them before."
1,"wait till Jaunaury, flimsy packaging","I was going to buy this till i saw how cheaply made the package is. It will scratch up fast if it is not already scratched from shipping in this cheap carton. Fox needs to look at parmounnt's indiana jones set to see how to put a box togetther, it has reguler keepcases and a nice box to go with it,Even the Godfather collection was packaged better then this, my advice wait till Jaunaury and purchase the movies seperetly and send fox a message. The only bad thing is you won't be able to get the 9th bonus disc."
2,"Great Movies, Incredibly Horrible Packaging","I thorougly enjoyed the first three Alien movies and eagerly awaited the release of this set. I think the movies are great. However, the set is the worst packaged DVD collection I have ever owned. The individual plastic cases which secure each movie to the cardboard backing frequently come loose and must be reattached. In addition, to take a movie out of the set, it must be unfolded to what seems like a length of six feet. Come on Fox, get it right. I would return these disks and buy the movies individually if I could."
3,De interes para las personas de habla española.,"Buen producto, pero para aquellos como yo, que no hablen ingles y que requieran subtitulos para ver las peliculas debo aclararles que solo las peliculas 1, 2 y 3 poseen audio y subtitulos en español, es absolutamente falso que la 4ta parte posea dicha caracteristica como lo reseña amazon en los detalles del producto. Solo trae audio en ingles y Frances y no trae ningun tipo de subtitulos. Adicionalmente, ninguno de los discos de caracteristicas especiales poseen dicha caracteristica, solo ingles. Nunca entendere la razon de no colocarle a los productos dicha opcion que no ocupa mas que unos bytes adicionales en el disco habiendo tanta gente en los estados unidos que hablan español, realmente y lamentablemente no cuentan para las productoras de cine. Entonces, amigos de habla español ya saben a que atenerse."
3,ummm........ I don't know,"I kinda expected more of this.I saw the first one. It's the best,but not that good.The only thrilling part is at the end.It's okay, but not that good(I know I said this already).Helpful Note:Rent each movie before buying."
1,Alien Quadrilogy,"One of the CDs was damaged in the first shipment so it had to be sent back. The second one was damaged in the same way. Must be a factory defect. Since it was a gift, I'm assuming the receiver got a gift card instead. So for the first time, I'm not happy with the service."
1,A very disappointing book,"""Off the Map"" is a slim, spotty and poorly edited little book, given to factual mistakes, irritating grammatical errors and not a whole lot of substance. This is the sort of book that makes me think the author wrote it hurriedly (and negligently), just to make a few bucks. Unfortunately, he got a few of my bucks, each of which I consider misspent."
4,"Not Perfect, Not Definitive, But Fun","Derek Nelson's book Off the Map is the historical equivalent of a bathroom book. This is not said to be derogatory. In many ways, that is the charm of the book. It is light, easy to read, and filled with many, many facts. There are too many facts coming at the reader to remember them all or to learn them. Instead, the reader will come away with the general knowledge of how important place-names are to a culture and how other cultures will view a place and give it a name of their own. Naming a place to some extent is a control issue and the struggle for control is an ever-changing idea. But even these ideas are too heavy to be sustained in this light book. This book is meant to read quickly and enjoyed throughout. It is cotton candy, sweet to taste but light on substance with a carnival happening just on the outskirts of the reader's eye."
3,Just a warning,"I purchased this DVD in order to obtain a relatively clean and sharp copy of I Eat Your Skin. Now, Something Weird has been completely honest in listing this as an ""extra"" rather than promoting the disc as a ""double-feature,"" because I Eat Your Skin is plagued with a video-produced ""SWV"" watermark that distractingly appears on the screen during the entire feature.The print also suffers from damage that eliminates 1-2 minutes of important dialogue, including the intruduction of a character."
4,Good guide...,"In order to understand some issues related with delphi 7, the book is very helpful. But is not a step by step book. In that case I advice to look for something more especific.This book is reality very good, an excellent work of the writer, you should buy it as a bible."
2,Skecthy and Spotty dbexpress reference,"I bought this book soley for the purpose of learning dbexpress - which hooks delphi up with a relational database management system. Delphi dbexpress accocomplishes this by setting up a collection of some six objects, which must have various flags, options, fields and parameters set and which must be correctly linked. Mr. Cantu fails to mention any of these flags, etc., gives only the sketchiest examples of code, and provides us with suplementary 'code' which apparently fails to either compile or to give us the details on the states and linkages of the objects. One more week of flailing and hacking my way through the dbexpress morass, and I should be able to write a much better tutorial/reference than has Mr. Cantu -- for all the respect he has in the field. It is possible that writing one definitive book on delphi, which does so much in so many different arenas, is simply too formidable a task."
3,It was ok but shallow and unbelievable,The characters were one dimensional. The ones with cystic fibrosis acted like saints. So did the black ones. The mothers were strong and attractive. The bigots were total jerks. The Jews had concentration camp tattoos. All very predictable & stereotypical.This must have taken place around 1990 - why didn't the wealthy parents of ill Timmy have air conditioning in their beautiful house?
2,Boring and totally predictable,I loved Evergreen but not this one by Belva...if you like tight little endings wrapped up in a bow - this one's for you...not me - UGH!
4,Bigotry at its finest,"We have two teenage daughters who have a difficult time understanding bigotry and how pervasive it is. I had first heard ""Daybreak"" on NPR's ""Radio Reader."" I loved it then and bought it and read it several years ago. The other night at supper we were trying to explain bigotry and how it is handed down for generations. I thought of ""Daybreak"" and had them read it.Being northerners we were sheilded from most racism. Neither my husband nor I remember racism or antisemitism as issues when we were growing up in small towns in Minnesota.Besides being a wonderful story ""Daybreak"" sheds alot of light on small-town southern American towns and how attitudes are inherited.""Daybreak"" remains one of my favorite books."
2,BEWARE!,"The book cover, the editor's introduction, and the Amazon blurb all suggest that the stories in this book come directly from Freshman magazine. Well, maybe they did originally, but ALL of the stories here have appeared in the Friction volumes, and some again in the Best of Friction volume. So if you own any or all of the Friction series, you already have some/all of the stories here. This duplication, of course, isn't illegal, and one expects some of it in anthologies, but the editor and Alyson Books have gone way beyond what's ethical in this case, since there is no hint that all the material has been previously released in their own anthologies. The stories themselves are as good/bad as they were in Friction volumes."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"The pictures in this book are so fuzzy,faded and out of focus. That it makes it almost impossible to tell one shark tooth from another.The book dose list alot of different shark teeth, but the quality of the pictures makes it difficult to tell one tooth from another."
3,I love Lucy seasons 7-9,It wasn't what I'd hoped. The old Lucy shows were excellent. This was one of her latest and it just wasn't as good. such is life.
3,Good but....,"I completed my DVD collection with Seasons 7-9. They are not as good as the I Love Lucy episodes, but they are funny. I was disappointed with the approach that was taken with the menus. In the other Lucy DVDs, the stick figures are in black and white and on this DVD they've been made color and annoyingly so on the menu screen. Additionally, there are not the same chapter breaks that were on the previous DVDs. For example, if you are watching them straight through and you don't want to hear the opening you could skip it, which you can on this DVD but if you do, you miss some of the beginning of the episode. Additionally, the extras are a little thin. The producers show all the bits that were taken out in syndication for each episode and label them as ""lost footage"". Ok-- this is good, but these scenes are also in the episodes on the DVD. So that is kind of a rip off. But overall, it is good. There should be more about the production, but that is just my personal preference."
5,Great sleeper movie! If you actually saw it you'd remember.,"I think the twists and turns of this movie are great. It starts off maybe a bit slower on first viewing, but when you have to watch it the second time you won't think that. It's both beautiful and thoughtful. And some great stars who don't seem to get much screen time these days. Definitely worth a Criterion DVD edition. Anyone listening?"
2,Disappointing,"This movie according to other reviews from previous buyers left me hoping for more. Frankly did not understand, maybe it was just me. Ellen Barkin is a beautiful lady, but was poorly utilized in this movie. Would not recommend to anyone. She wore that red dress out and constantly on the run."
1,This film stinks,"This a film I never forgotten for several reasons although I would like to, the haunting music of Marcus Miller and the story which is truly abysmal, the acting is unspeakably bad,the direction non existent. It is worse than Showgirls and that takes some doing. In fact it does n't even deserve one star."
2,Jungle Adventure,"I did not really enjoy this book. I love Sandra Marton and her stories usually, but this was an exception. I guess I didn't like it because of the jungle setting. To me, running from a wild tribe in search of a diamond is just not all that romantic and conducive to falling in love. The characters were good though, and they made up for the plot line, in my opinion. Slade is definitly a hunk, and Brionny was a typical female character for Marton, the kind that argues at every step with the guy. That got a little tiresome, as it usually does for me. But if you like the jungle advenure scene this book is for you. Unfortunately, it wasn't for me."
2,"Too much selling, and not enough application.","I'd hoped for much more from this book. I found it to be focused too much on selling the idea of a web ministry to churches rather than teaching churches how to go about applying web ministries. The content of the book should've been the opposite, more application and result possibilities, which might've, ironically, better sold churches on the idea of a web ministry."
4,Let the Buyer Beware,If I Knew about price and demand I would have ordered 6 not 3 at that price. I wish I could get 3 more at 9.99.
2,Somewhat Disappointing...,"This book was selected as our Book Club's Book of the Month and I was somewhat disappointed after reading the book. I'd heard so many great accolades for the Arabesque Romances that I was really excited to have the opportunity to read one.Well, unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed. Although the novel had the murder mystery, parallel love affair, and ""damsel in distress/knight in shining armor"" (Kennedy St. James/Max Collier) components--it still fell flat. The elements for a great story was there but seemed to be lacking character depth for the central characters and I found myself wanting to know more about the supporting cast. The end also seemed to be a bit rushed and forced.Overall, I would rate it a 2.5 if it were allowed, but I don't feel generous enough to push it up to a three. I am willing to read other works by Ms Byrd and other Arabesque authors."
3,Item not as pictured,The cabinet is nice but the doors that were recived were not solid wood. They were woven reed. Not nearly as solid and nice looking. Other than that well built and decent for the price. The four odd panels really were disappointing
1,False advertising,"False advertising. Offer clearly says one will receive four placemats, but only one placemat arrives with an invoice for one. No response from company."
5,Thriving to Understand the World.,"I brought this because I know there is sooo much more for me to take in and process. It's like new, but the price was definitely right. Great book!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great for my Gibson Hummingbird,These strings last and they moderated some of the booming I get from other strings. I use the EXP Phosphor bronze on my other dreads.
2,Definitely Better Off Getting The Non-Coated Versions,"These strings aren't as good as the exact same strings minus the ""extended play"" coating. The coating just makes the strings squeakier and scratchier, flat picking or finger plucking. Also, it makes the guitar sound more metallic. I suppose the coating will make them last longer, but it really isn't worth the loss in sound quality. Maybe I could see recommending these strings to someone if they were only going to play their guitar like once a year, and then the rest of the time it was going to sit unloved, strings oxidizing. But even then, I'd probably err on the side of skip 'em.Laters, ya'll."
2,Room in Rome,I know naked two women in room. I found nudity really. I know two women without clothing. I know naked lesbian. I know a man look naked woman on the hall near the room.
3,adam,"bigger than i thought originally, but it is a wonderfully real feeling material. not for the novice because of size."
1,not so much fun,"Well, the suction cup ripped when placed on tub....now I cant ride it!! No exchange or refund:( they also charged me for a cancelled order."
4,Strangely Addictive,"1989 meets 21st century MIDI and synth recording technology. Strangely addictive. You've heard all the elements before, but probably not together in this way. Although I haven't seen them live, I've heard they have been taking over festivals. I'm sure their energy and attitude has a lot to do with that."
2,FRUSTRATION,"This is a great idea for a fun toy, but, oh, the frustration it causes. The balloons must be positioned just so, and blown up to a precise diameter in order to be popped with the small pin that pops out when the laser is used. Very frustrating for the target age of 8 or so. Older kids could probably manage, but it wouldn't hold their interest for very long."
1,I am actually afraid of the CSI show. This is also gross and scarey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gross. CSI is a show with BLOOD AND GUTS AND BODIES. My dad let me watch ONE episode and I ran when he turned it on ever since.I am always TERRIFIED when he turns it on and go to another room. Don't buy this 'victim' or you will be afraid of it...
4,wow!,"wow! is the first thing i said when i finally saw this toy!! i put it on my wish list for my husband to buy. CSI or not it's a toy for a more cerebrial child, not ""mental"" like the other comments. My daughter is in love with bugs and life, intergrating them both into a toy is an excellent idea and very creative and ARTISTIC. I have been left with few options and piles of unopened Barbies, Bratz...and a broken overused bug carrier set... thanks for the variety!!"
3,this is neat .i couldnt make homer simpson,This head is so cool!!!! I tried to make a homer simpson on it and it didnt work. I like to make some silly face with it. I don't watch CSI.
2,SAT words are good but the story is bad.,"I'm 18 and I just finished reading this book. I gave it two stars only because of the amount of SAT words. The book is really bad and to make it worse, it was mandatory for a class I took. I was really disapointed at the story line and I was expecting a much better read. The SAT words were great and there is a lot of them, but I found it more enjoyable to read magazines even though there are much less SAT words. However, everybody learns differently. I learn SAT words with flash cards while other people learn SAT words by reading books. Its not a long book and it can be educational, so read it for the SAT words. Remember those SAT words but forget the story."
4,Book,Preparing for retirement. Some good guidelines here to follow. I'm always looking for ways to improve just like some of you all.
1,Not what I expected,"This what not at all what we expected. There was no off and on switch or thermostat. They could be purchased for more money. I returned them. Not a good deal at all, and not a realistic description of the item."
3,Not a bad book...,"This isn't a bad book but, It is isn't one that would go down as one of the best books I have ever read. Many of the cure and advice make you think that suffering the illness might have been better than the cure! This book is amusing because it makes you think about what life was like when these things were advised to people!"
5,perfect,"this works as it said, I live in a rainforest and am constantly fighting mildew; I put this in a downstairs room about 400 sq. ft. and it keeps clothes from smelling mildewy"
4,"Cute Show, Love the Bunnies!!","This is a cute show which always has a funny ending for learning! The only episode witch feature Ruby with a different voice was the first one on the DVD. It is not that different and didn't bother me at all, in fact it was cute! This dvd does have lots of episodes on it with the original voices, just the first one sounds a little different it's nothing that would keep me from buying it! This cartoon is so much better for children than a lot of the ones they show on cartoon network!"
4,Verhoeven's exercise in suspense thriller and excess,"Paul Verhoeven remains an interesting director who treads between art and commercialism with a European style of excess without alienating the audiences (unlike Godard!) His early Dutch films remain a fascinating watch.The Fourth Man is a straigh forward suspense thriller that somehow acts as a prelude to his later femme fatale genre piece, Basic Instinct. Full of tongue in cheek metaphors ranging from black widow spiders and its preys, popped out eyeball and even the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ!Verhoeven is always a pleasure to listen to when it comes to commentaries in his films. Unpretentious, full of anecdotes and information into the making of his films."
1,One star is too many,I couldn't agree with the other reviews more. I only wish I had read the reviews before subjecting myself to such a frustrating day of trying to understand this supposedly simple approach to VBA. It wasnt even well written for someone who had some VBA knowledge.
2,"Too narrative, not enough hands-on","I've used other ""For Dummies"" books, and expected more. I was disappointed. The book seemed intent on touting the individual capabilities of the interface and components without building the reader's SKILL in using them. Part of the problem is in the scope, how you use VBA is somewhat application-specific, so trying to teach it from a multi-application reference is a losing battle. The author even admits that many of the examples won't work if typed in as-is. The biggest shortcoming is in VBA/Parent Application information linking. If you want ideas on what VBA is capable of, go ahead and buy this, but if you're trying to develop a program for a specific application, buy an application-specific book by another publisher instead/also."
2,SHREDS OF SILVER,The blender is loud but that can be overlooked. It doesn't work like I expected a commercial blender to. I thought this would be a quality item for the price. It did not crush and mix all that well even with the tool. Not the easiest to clean and after a short period of time we began to notice that the ALUMINUM AROUND THE BLADE AREA STARTED TO SHRED AND CHIP AND TINY PIECES WERE IN THE FOOD. YUK! To find a replacement part was a joke. Couldn't find anyone who sells the replacement parts and L'Equip was always out of stock-go figure. Then again why buy a $37 replacement container to have it shred into the food? The blender wasn't that great to keep buying replacement containers.
2,Wrong CD in correct case.,"I ordered the CD by America, the title ""Hearts"". The CD I received was in the CD case of America, Hearts, but the CD inside was from the Album ""America's Greatest Hits"". Very disappointed, DeLinda Gover"
5,Joe Pass-perfect solo guitar,"If you're looking at Virtuoso No. 4 chances are you know about the first one and, hopefully, love it. Well, this set comes from the same sessions as Virtuoso No. 1. SO, is it as good? Can it be? Absolutely yes. No one, ever has, and doubtfully ever will again, play guitar like Joe Pass. He is unparalleled as a solo guitarist. He will, at once, inspire you and possibly make you want to sell your guitar(s). If you want to know how to play solo jazz guitar this is where to start. Pick up any of the Virtuoso cds and also pick up his cds teaming up with Ella. There are 2 ways to describe Mr. Pass' playing and both are the names of posthumous albums of his, ""Unforgettable,"" and ""What is there to say?"""
4,Nice book,"I really love being able to look at clear photos of MLPs. The book is worth buying just for the photos. The prices are a bit lower than usual going prices, but no one could ever keep up with the changing values. Also, More often then not the accessories for the playsets are wrong, but everyone makes mistakes."
2,Not as good as her others.,"I have to say I wasn't a fan. I love many of her other books, but his... just didn't do it for me. I never really understood why the heroine acted the way she did. I also never understood why she never called the wicked mother out for herself being a whore considering she had a illegitimate son (my first thought was figure out how to make fliers of the wicked witch with her kinky ways). I assume we are going to find out who the girl who helped in the end was in later parts of this series. I thought it dragged. Besides her step brother I didn't particularly like any of the characters in the book."
2,Not so good,I didn't like the way the book was written. I didn't like the ending...I just didn't like it period. Sorry.
3,Complicated,"I did not particularly care for this read. I felt it was hard to follow and confusing. I still like the author, but unfortunately not this selection."
1,Some Improvement Required,"Few books I have read I dislike. However, ""Zombie"" is a book that needs improvement. The writing is choppy and does not flow well. The form appears to attempt to set up the appearance of a journal, diary or biography however, this does not work. I was unable to get past the first 10 pages as there was no plot to follow as well. Use of vulgarity does not enhance the flow of the sentences either. Unfortunately, I do not recommend this book to others."
2,Ugh...,"This novel is well written and the plot seemed interesting st first, but it was just too graphic for me..."
4,At times boring but mostly interesting,"It is lacking in genuine action but makes up greatly in the psychological aspects. It's one of those stories that makes you think about your own life. In parts of the story, I was unable to get into the ""novel."" It was quite disturbing with its use of stereotypes, which makes one think how close to reality this story really is. All in all, it was a fast read and a story I will always remember."
1,Very Inappropriate!,"This book was under the teen/ young adult category. Please let me say the book was new and the condition itself was great that was not a complaint but, as far as reading this book is VERY graffic and I by no means think this should be read by someone under 17 and at my 25 I didnt even finish the book it was way to inappropriate and uncomfortable. I do not have a problem with people being attracted to same or opposite sex but this book makes being gay and serial killing very hard to swollow. It discusses rape, very intense behavior and very intense use of foul language. It may be a good read for some but not for me."
4,"After Nearly 20 Years, Still Gives me the Shivers","No, this is not a zombie novel, but what it is is stripped down, no-holds-barred gruesomeness as this Quintin character, a 20's something loser, shares his murderous story. Wanting to create his own ""zombie slaves"" that will kneel and obey his every command, Quintin uses sharp objects to attempt lobotomies on his victims. One aspect that really drives the chills is the fact that Quintin does not seem to even realize what he is doing, yet there is some strange, twisted type of moral structure within his own sick world. If you've seen the film, ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" then you kind of get the idea.I love when Joyce Carol Oates writes horror. Truly, it is a pleasure to read from this master when she pens these macabre tales. Ignore the bad reviews-- those seeking a quick read that will disturb and chill, look no further."
3,It was okay,"Not exactly what I was expecting it to be, but it was a pretty good read once I got used to the style."
2,The Walking Dead revisited,"I have been a fan of Joyce Carol Oates for many years and when I see she has released a new book, I'm there to get it. However, Zombie left me chilled, and not from the dead bodies that seem to surround Oates' protagonist--so unforgettable I've forgotten his name--posing as a mild mannered young man, with a record, trying to fool mom, dad and grandma while he searches for the perfect, lobotomized love machine to spend the rest of his life with while holding down a job as the handyman at his parents' rental unit.I can understand even a well-known author trying to get on the zombie train, but this novel was beneath Oates' significant talent and weirdness."
2,"Quality lights, low energy cost- bulbs no longer available",We have had these lights for several weeks and are quite happy with them. The LED lights put out a sharp white light. The holders appear to be of good quality. The only down side is that the literature specifies use of their tranformer and does not give a source for a replacement should the one supplied need fail. No source was give for the light bulbs which also appear to be specialty items.This is a follow up review. I have had two light bulbs go out after less than 2 years. The bulbs were made by Westinghouse and are no longer available. In an age when we are trying to conserve I will have to replace the entire set instead of buing a simple light bulb. Shame on you Amazon for selling such a turkey.
3,Fits,"The Cap arrived as scheduled, and was as described. I did notice that although Amazon's ""MAKE SURE IT FITS"" selection screen says it does fit my application the Cap arrived as a 16psi cap, my factory application is a 15psi cap. It is still acceptable, however the site should be updated."
2,"forgettable text, enjoyable illustrations","This is a really shallow and not always accurate history that skims far too lightly over many subjects. It is, however, fun to pore over the 263 illustrations."
3,Coffee-table history of Scotland,"This volume is a standard coffee-table book with numerous photos and illustrations and a text meant for general readership. It's certainly nice to peruse, but that's about it. This book was also published by Bison in 1986."
3,He only sings a few songs here,"Saratoga Hunch is a good Song. If you aren't a Frishberg fanatic, go for another of the albums (Classics or Who's on First) Only players trying to cope Dave's keyboard technique should probably get this album"
2,Very hard to use,"I got this as a Christmas gift. I found it extremely hard to use.Cueing or skipping songs is easy enough, but hitting the ""mode"" key is very awkward. I can't store it in my pocket or bag because the ""power"" key will inevitably get hit. I went through 3 batteries in 2 weeks. The directions (on CD and in writing) are very confusing. At first, I thought I couldn't use it with Mac OS.On the plus side, I had no problem loading songs onto it or getting them off (with Mac OS X). The backlight is easy on the eyes.This is basically a gussied-up flash drive, which is fine. I'm not looking for something that plays videos. However, it shouldn't be so hard to play a podcast or some tunes."
2,Rythms of the songs missing,"This book has a lot of stories, rhymes and songs, but first it should come with a cd to hear the rhythm of the songs, it's really a waist of time with the songs if you don't know the rhythm. Second sometimes the traduction is not very accurate. That's why I don't highly recommend this book"
5,Best of three,"I usually listen to an entirely different type of music than the kind these musicians make. Yet I find this album extremely enjoyable. This is especially odd because the title track is the oft ridiculed ""Muskrat Love"". But this song's supposed sentimentality doesn't bother me and blends in with the overall eclectic quality of the album.Within a pop spectrum there is a little bit of everything on this album, including melancholy love songs, a bit of progressive rock, and the expected ballads. I bought this album for our anniversary and my wife and I both enjoyed it immensely. Definitely the best album of the band's first three."
3,little disapointed,There where only like 2 shows and that was it. I was exspecting it to be longer and more.
5,I'm a Dexterolic,"When I need suspense in my life and want to see great plot writers at work, I throw on a Dexter e[isode."
1,Way to go Showtime,"Wow. Thanks for the warnings guys. Unfortunately I also managed to see the @#$@#$ spoiler by accident.So Showtime...you just lost a customer. I came here to buy the season and realized...why would I want to support it after you F#### your viewer.Sorry Dexter, I'll miss you."
1,"Love Dexter, HATE HATE HATE these DVDs!","The show, and Michael C. Hall, remain superb, but this is a CRAP DVD set. *Every* DVD in the set begins with two or three minutes of stupid commercials for junk you'd never watch, and the UOP (User Operation Prohibited) won't let you (1) go to the top menu and start playing the DVD you've bought, or even (2) skip past the commercials individually or en masse. This is such a travesty, and an assault on people who like the series. I'm beginning to think ROLLING STONE was right when they said ""UOP killed the DVD"" -- at least in instances like this where it's so misused. My advice is to NOT buy this set but rather wait to rent it from Netflix or get it from your local library. You'll still have to (TIP) mute the sound and go away for a few minutes when it starts up, but at least you won't be encouraging this sort of consumer abuse."
1,Great Season - Fail for Showtime/Paramount,"This was a great season of Dexter. However, as other reviews have stated, this product ruins the cliffhanger by having the final scene shown every time you start EVERY disc. This Showtime preview is probably 3 minutes long. I have contacted Showtime and was told:Thank you for reaching out to us.Paramount Home Entertainment is responsible for the manufacture and distribution of our Original Series DVDs and we are working together to remove that preview from future prints of the ""Dexter"" Season Six DVD.For more information, please contact Paramount Home Entertainmet at phe_customerservice@paramount.comSincerely,Showtime Customer ServiceMaybe it will be fixed, maybe not."
4,Consisitently mesmerizing.,"I know there have been others who have disliked the sixth season of Dexter, but I thought it was great. Sure, there is the ever present danger of the discovery of his ""dark passenger,"" but I liked how this season took on the theme of faith and belief. For me it made the season more thought provoking and discussion worthy. I'm really looking forward to seeing what happens in the upcoming season."
5,Best season of Dexter yet (haven't seen 7 yet),"**TOTALLY SPOILER FREE**First I want to say that I was lucky to get this on Instant Video so I didn't have the DVD problem others had where Showtime gave away the ending in the show previews. But I was thankful to be warned about that ahead of time in case it had happened. So if you get the DVD, shut off the show previews so you don't have the end spoiled for you because this season is incredible.I've watched all of the seasons of Dexter up to Season 6 which I just finished. I don't have Showtime so I always rent the DVDs but couldn't find this one anywhere so ended up buying it and I'm so glad I did because it is one I will want to watch again. Intense, Exciting, Surprising, Exceptional.Also, I have to say that I love little Harrison. He is absolutely adorable and sweet and he's brought out a totally different side to Dexter that Dexter didn't expect and I love that. If you like the show and haven't seen Season 6, definitely check it out."
2,"Show Good, DVD Bad","I'm going to echo the other reviews here and say that, while Dexter is some of the most riveting television ever produced, these DVD's are terrible. I'm very happy to have seen the sixth season, but I don't know that I will ever rewatch it because of the unskippable showtime commercial that comes on every time you put any of the discs in. I'll admit that I didn't notice the spoiler in the trailer because I was not paying it any attention. Showtime really borked this one."
2,"Good Show, Bad DVDs.","The show is still one of the best, but they include un-skippable ads for other shows I have no immediate interest in. Also, why spoil the ending to season 6 in both TV ads, and DVD ads? That was terrible.Whoever edited that into the DVD's is one of the biggest trolls in DVD promotionals history."
2,Don't buy the DVDs,"I enjoy Dexter and the sixth season as on par with the others, but if you want to watch it, don't buy the DVDs. It is incredibly annoying that every disc has a long list of Showtime ads that come up every time you put a disc in. You can't skip them, jump to the main menu, or even fast forward. That is really unacceptable for a product of this price."
5,Great Series,I LOVE Dexter. I highly recommend this series - starting with season 1. Excellent service and shipping as usual by Amazon. I don't think you'll be unhappy with this series.
1,Showtime Ruined it.,"As others have noted, the way these DVDs are authored, you are forced to sit through a long promotional sequence for Showtime that shows the climax of the season.That's not the only problem with the authoring. Unlike some (but not all) of the other seasons, you cannot skip through the recap and opening credits by using the skip forward button. Instead of taking you to the actual beginning of the episode, it jumps you 5-10 minutes into it.Worst DVD authoring in the history of DVD authoring.The show is great, but don't reward these fools for their incompetence by buying these discs. Borrow from a friend, get them on Netflix if you have it, or find a legal way to see it for free."
1,Who's the IDIOT at Showtime?!,"I loved this 6th season of Dexter, but who is the IDIOT, the MORON that decide to put all the Showtime ads on the front of each disc that you CAN NOT escape out of, you CAN NOT skip through, you CAN NOT FAST FORWARD through that you are forced to watch in order to get to the main menu and then to include in that montage quite LITERALLY the LAST shot of the final episode of Dexter's 6th season. HOW STUPID ARE YOU?!!!"
4,Always a Dexter Fan,"Although I feel this season was a little convoluted at times, I thought the over all storywas good and interesting. If you are a dexter fan you definately have to see it, but besure to start at the beginning of the series."
3,The Thresher crew and family deserve better than this,"The crew and family of the Thresher deserve a better book than this. Unfortunately there are few books that discuss the Thresher disaster, so that makes this important reading. The book tends to be repetitive with a few glaring mistakes. Most of what happened to the Thresher is classified. Those looking for answers to what truly happened will leave only half fullfilled."
1,"Not worth the money!!! (This is a 0 star in my book, but that isn't an option.)","This book is 95% gay sex (at times very vulgar, violent, incestuous) and 5% plot and story line. If that is your thing, then this is the book for you."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this back in March and have only used it twice. The first time, I baked a cake, which turned out great. I was thrilled. However, a few days ago, I used it to store a few mini cheesecakes in the refrigerator. I put it in the dishwasher and when I took it out, I was shocked by the color it had turned. I thought it might be a film and tried to get it off, but it appears that a quarter of the pan is now an ugly, dark marbled grey. I bought it so I could take it with me to events and get-togethers. I would be embarrassed to take it with me now.I have seen comments left my others that it could be the dish washing detergent. I use a typical brand, with no extra chemicals. If it is dishwasher safe, it is dishwasher safe. Unfortunately, mine wasn't.I have only baked in it once, but I would have to pay return shipping to get half my money back. Not really worth it."
4,"Nice even baking, no burning","Bought this pan to replace two other ones that had become very scratched over time. These pans are really nice for baking, stuff rarely burns in them and they come with a nice fitting cover. They are my go to pan when I am just baking for at home. Since they are not that expensive, I figure they can be replaced every few years. On the downside, they do scratch easily when you use metal utensils to cut in them, and who doesn't use a metal knife to cut brownies? They also pretty much can never go in your dishwasher because they will get water forced into the air compartment which is next to impossible to get out, so they have to be hand washed. Overall, a great little pan and a great value!"
3,sufficient,"I expected this bowl to be bigger, however I should have paid closer attention to the measurements. It doesn't hold much water and needs to be filled up often. But I gave it 3 stars because it is slip resistant, my 2 small dogs aren't able to push it around the room, which means less spillage."
1,Disappointed & Ticked,"Did not survive transit. Arrived broken in pieces. Supplier ""got ghost,"" ignoring e-mail asking how to return item. Needless to say, no refund was forthcoming, either."
3,legendary journey to the top,"Kevin VanSickle W131 ""Book Review"" Larry Legend is an interesting book about a boy who fell in love with the game of basketball and developed his own self-discipline as he became an adult. Larry Bird's success and consistent team management are his legendary qualities, according to author Shaw. Mark Shaw writes about Larry's roughneck childhood, what led to his triumphs in his high school basketball days, and through his professional career as a player, then a coach. Larry seemed to have gained confidence and self-esteem at a young age and by keeping those positive aspects he became an intimidator and motivator for many. This book will intoxicate your interest if you want to hear about the Legend's journey to the top. In Larry Legend, Mr. Shaw explains how the Legend himself was a role model, not only for young players, but also, his teammates and coaches around the league."
4,A book to treasure,"Fantastic portrait of Larry Bird, specially of his first season as a NBA coach. Shaw has the great ability to make imaginative metaphores and to create surprising game reports. I wonder if Larry Bird suspected that a writer was watching him closely during an entire season?"
4,Mr.Shaw does not appear to hold back...,This has been a good read ... I am about halfway through. He provided great insite into the world of the Birdman...
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I found this book lacking in both intrigue and romance. The writing is moderately good, but the plot sags in places. I didn't get any sense of connection or urgency in the romance until the one lover was kidnapped. One of the things I found strange was that a well-educated, professional woman would persist in nosing into what was going on even though she had been warned off and slightly injured. I had no indication that she thought she could really do anything when the captain of the ship was obviously disinclined to get involved in what was cleary a sticky situation. I do understand why after the kidnapping her lover went to find her. It isn't a very long book, but it took me a while to get through it."
1,wrong cord,Please do not buy this if your Mazda has Bose will not work and you will spend to hours at the car shop trying to figure out why your speakers don't work.
5,Made it easy.,"Nothing complicated here... just a harness that allows you to splice like-colored wires (red to red, violet to violet...) from this harness, to the harness provided by your aftermarket stereo's harness... then just plug this harness into the Mazda's harness... and the stereo works - is wired correctly to each speaker. Mazda's wires (and all auto wires) do not subscribe to the standard stereo color scheme.It made the job dummy-proof and this harness worked fine in my 2007 Mazda5.Note: the factory stereo is integrated with the steering wheel controls and the green LCD display at the top of the dash; this harness does not integrate with either; you need other stuff to keep the steering wheel controls working and I don't know how you'd make an aftermarket radio work with the LCD display."
5,I LOVE Taco Bob,"Since I'm up to date on all Tim Dorsey & Carl Hiassen, I decided to give Robert Tacoma a try. I'm so glad I did! I'm a big fan of Florida fiction - and these books really deliver. So funny! Can't wait for the next book.Rock on Taco Bob!"
4,"Way out and daring, if technically suspect","This is another of mostly-hip-hop producer Madlib's alter ego as band, basically his Yesterday's New Quintet ""group"", but with one of the cats in the leader. It's really just Madlib playing everything and it works...even when it has no right to.He goes for a trippy, Weldon-ish, Art Ensemble of Chicago-Meets-Herbie Hancock ""Sextant thing here, and despite his utter inability to play a really good keyboard solo, makes a really, really great record. It's got groove for days, and is filled with his trademark daring."
3,White Blaze Fever,A gift item for my son and I'm not sure how to review it because I did not read it. He said it was good.
1,Too many exclamation points,"I brought this book along with me on a backpacking trip. It doesn't seem fair that such a poor writer was able to come out with a book. Damn Bryson. But it gets better. Not only does the guy write like Mr. Rogers, but his ""tips"" are comicial. Worse than anything they put in a 'dummies' book. This is a typical entry from the guy:Quote:I walked out of the shelter and boy it was raining! It was raining very hard! I saw some day hikers and they said it was wet. I came back with ""Glad we got rain jackets!HIKER TIP:I brought a lightweight, breathable rain jacket. This kept me dry and allowed me to breathe!"
1,Kind of a drag,"Remarkably poorly written. This book is a cry for help from a professional editor. Other reviewers call it ""realistic"" - I really hope hiking the AT isn't anywhere near as monotonous as this book."
3,Good for true beginners,"If you're still in college and you want to know how to create readable, clear, interesting presentations then this book is for you. It's also great to give someone on your team who may be trying to cram 8pt typeface onto all their PowerPoints. The best parts of the book describe how to lay out presentation slides for easy readability. However, if you've taken a Speech class, most of the ""public speaking"" sections of the book will not be news to you."
1,Skip this required reading...,Recently purchased this book as it was required reading for a MBA-level business communications class... Skip it. There's an entire section on the benefit of white space in Power Point slides. The majority of this book is intuitive - and what's not is available for free online.
5,Library favorite,"Like previous reviewers, I too read this in my school library during my younger days. It's been more than 10 years since I've had the chance to experience this wonderful book again.One of the best books I've ever read. And Ambrus' illustrations are just splendid!"
1,Very misleading,"This money clip looks nothing like the picture. It was a coin magnet stuck to a golf ball money clip that looked like it was assembled in someone's garage. The textured gold background in the picture does not exist! All it had was an ugly piece of grey metal for a clip, and the coin wasn't even attached to the metal. PLus, it took them a really long time to send the item to me. Total waste of time. I would give them negative stars if I could."
2,Not impressed,Not impressed with product. Did not do what it described and did not help with rosacea. Could just be me. Would not buy again.
4,Ok for what it is,Ok for what it is . My kid just got bored. But we speak Spanish in our home I was just trying to get her to learn how to roll her r's better and other pronunciations.
4,Great album,"I have been waiting for 4 years for this new Nick Cave album and I am positively surprised by it. I was afraid that after 'The boatman's call' Nick Cave would end his career but now he is back with this great album. I must admit that I had to listen a couple of times to get used to and some of the songs are too smooth, but overall the album is great. I am looking forward to his concert in The Netherlands in June."
1,perhaps cave is too old to rock.,"As a long time fan I think I can say that this is the worst album Cave has ever released. At its best this album is an overproduced rehashing of ""The Boatman's Call"". Several songs feature progressions almost indistinguishable from songs on ""the boatman's call. All songs are melodramatic and too long. Cave's vocals- more indulgent and melodramatic than ever- are mixed way too loud. Lyrics are just embarrassing (especially- fifteen feet of pure white snow? As I sat sadly by her side?). Perhaps Cave is really too old to rock."
1,A Round Bore,"I can't believe how little life this album has. It's tepid, bland, and mediocre, and a profound upset to a Nick Cave fan like myself.Not a single lyric on the entire record resonated for me in the way I'm accustomed from a NC record. If it did for you, well, I'm glad, but it really didn't for me. I was very dissapointed."
2,A disappointing effort,"I was so excited when I heard that there was a new Nick Cave CD. As dearly as I love ""Murder Ballads"" and ""Let Love In,"" I was hungering for some new Nick.Well, this isn't what I was hungry for. Only three songs -- ""As I Sat Sadly By Her Side,"" ""Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow"" and ""We Came Along This Road"" -- resonate with the vocal and lyrical intensity of his past works. The rest of them are too wordy or too vocally weak. (Who the heck told Nick to start singing in a higher register?)If you're new to Nick, don't start here -- begin with the wonderful ""Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,"" which has a good selection from all thei albums. If you're a longtime Nick fan, give this one a listen at your friendly local record store before deciding to buy. I sold mine and haven't regretted it once."
5,The Mishnah,Not as confusing as the Talmud and It's a very good reference book for understanding Jewish thought. It's a must have for scholars wanting to deepen their understanding of orthodox Jewry.
2,"No Encyclopedia, This.","I glean from the other 2 reviews that this book lacks veracity; as a Harley neophyte, I would hardly know if the information presented is inaccurate.My own complaint is that I was hoping for something a little meatier although I found some of the information interesting. I, too, wish there was more about individual models, perhaps more ""color"" about the idiocyncracies or character of the various bikes. Nor is it comprehensively encyclopedic. I would have expected information on every aspect of these motorcycles, including specs for all the models, etc.I didn't think this was a ""bad"" book. It's merely just not exactly a ""good"" book and could probably be characterized as mediocre. And yes, disappointing."
5,Semper fidelis,"I liked the show from the first moment on. I like the cast, the storylines and the chemestry between the actors. It it very enjoyable."
4,2 b continued,great show only had 1 problem it was to be continued and i had not yet recieved season 4 and had 2 wait to see how it continued
5,Fastpaced...inating,"This was a well written, fast-paced account of the war in Afghanistan. I came out of this read with an even greater level of respect for our CIA's field operatives and the sacrifices they make. We fought this war very differently than any before this and avoided the disaster experienced by the Soviets in the 1980s. The CIA and the military working very closely with the Afghans and each other. I think it is safe to say our military commanders overly cautious approach and their insistence on using overwhelming force helped OBL slip away in Tora Bora. It's unfortunate, but war can be complicated. This insider's view helps the reader understand what can go right and what can go wrong. Read it, you will enjoy."
4,Sensors gone wild.,"Great, great book. Though heavely sensored, it is great. Most if not all sensored info is availible from other books. This book is straight forward and very readable. Only the needed info is made known, with no fluff."
3,The next generation Bravo Two Zero,"Berntsen's account of the CIA action in Afghanistan is a highly readable and enjoyable romp through a remarkable operation. In this way it is very similar to Bravo Two Zero. Unfortunately, Berntsen's obvious displeasure with his former employer often clouds his view. There are also large sections of blacked out text, which are highly annoying. This is the books biggest problem and a potential buyer should consider waiting for the paperback version, when this has hopefully been sorted out. However, overall an interesting read that doesn't excercise the brain too much."
4,Interesting Read,"Overall an interesting book. Well thought out and written, however it is heavily censored.The best part about this book is the inside view showing the frustration of those on the ground. On its own it is not groundbreaking, but put together with a few other books on the early Afghan operations, it paints a broad picture for the reader that is exciting and informative."
3,It could have been better!,"Let me start off saying that this was the worst Dear America book I ever read. It wasn't like the other Dear America books because it never had a happy moment in it. Bad thing after bad thing happened. The main character's mother dies, she hasn't seen the boy she loved, and her beloved Confedferate army is suffering. The setting is in Gordonsville, Virginia, where many important Civil War events happen. Her living room is used as headquarters for the Yankee Army. Do yourself a favor: don't read this book. I gave it three stars beacuse it was informative, but it was not very interesting."
5,A must read for any 8-13 year old girl who likes history!,"The Civil War changed fourteen year old Emma Simpson'slife forever. Her father and brother went to fightfor the Confederacy, and Emma's brother dies inbattle. Emma's world is torn apart as war ragesat her doorstep. There are food shortages, and Unionsoldier occupy Emma's small hometown. Emma's mothergets ill and dies, and Emma wonders if life willever be the same again. A touching, poignant book.Readers will relate to Emma, and the diary formatenables the reader to know what its like to have yourworld torn apart while war rages at your doorstep...a must-read for any girl ages 8-13 who is interestedin history. Also reccomended: Sally Bradford: TheStory of a Rebel Girl by Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler,and Emma Eileen Grove, Mississippi, 1865 by KathleenDuey."
3,Good for a research paper,"Don't get me wrong, this book isn't going to have you captivated from cover to cover, but if you're looking for a good book to do a research project on in elections and voting behavior--this certainly is one of the most exciting choices around."
1,Dissapointing,I was expecting a book of fun facts and trivia. What I got was a badly printed pamphlet filled with Catholic propoganda. Not worth the paper it was printed on.
3,SOME INCORRECT INFORMATION OTHERWISE ENJOYABLE,I ENJOY HISTORICAL NOVELS AS A RULE THAT IS THE REASON I READ IT. I FOUND SOME INFORMATION ABOUT INDIA & INDIAN CUSTOMS INCORRECT-ROSHANARA & ASRAF ARE MUSLIMS AS THEIR NAMES INDICATE-ASRAF's FATHER GREAT KHANSAMAH WOULD BE A MUSLIM ALSO-UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES HE WOULD BURN HIS SON's BODY ON A PYRE AS MUSLIM'S BURY THEIR DEAD-THEREFORE ROSHANARA CANNOT BE A SUTEE. THIS HORRIBLE CUSTOM WAS ONLY PERFORMED BY HIGH CASTE BRAHMINS & RULING CLASS HINDUS. I HOPE THIS REVIEW IS PASSED ON TO THE WRITER SO SHE DOES NOT MISINFORM HER READERS WHO DO NOT KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT INDIA & OTHER COUNTRIES & THEIR CUSTOMS.
5,Love this book,"I got this book for my brother who Loves dragons. It's a great gift to anyone who does. The art work is beautiful, and it has some very net information about dragons. And everybody els he showed the book to Loved it also. It's a great book anyone. To people who has Loved dragons sense they were little, from people who are not all that into them. But they still Love the art work of the dragons."
3,Maturity level,"There is some mild sexual content to this book, so be forewarned if buying for a younger kid."
1,Before purchasing this book,"I'd recommend reading the reviews for A Good Dog. Jon Katz wrote three books about his issues with his border collies. One dog was given to another home because he couldn't cope with it, or train it appropriately; the second dog - the one he made the most money from by writing about - he euthanized because the dog's behavioral problems had become ""unmanageable"". Based on Katz's track record and other reviews from this book. I wouldn't waste your money."
1,this guy is an expert?,I find it amazing that Jon Katz is writing a book about dog training considering that he gave away one dog that he was unable to train and euthanized the other. And he makes money dispensing advice with this kind of track record?! Disgusting.
5,great product at a great price,"I've tried splitters/joiners alone, and then added a single line amplifier. But the results were usually more noise. My goal was to take the antenna feed and add some modulated channels and distribute it to the rest of the house. This Channel Vision unit was the solution. The unit is surprisingly heavy and accommodates 2 inputs - antenna line, as well as the modulated channels from my satellite box(Dish VIP 622 - ch 65, 57). Even comes with a power supply, where others don't. Having tried a cheap amplifier, I was reluctant to try another. I'm glad I did."
3,shoddy labyrinth,"this was a favorite toy as a kid -- but then it was made solidly, with careful craftsmanship in Sweden.Now it's made in China and feels like a cheap knock-off."
3,dye bleeds like crazy,"I bought two of these when my now two-year-old son was born. They fit our Pack N Play fine, but I made the mistake of throwing them in with some of his clothes and the dye bled and turned everything blue. I later washed them alone, but noticed blue staining on the inside of my dryer after drying them. I stopped using them because I didn't want the dye to come off on my son, his clothes, or anything else.They did fit well, though, so I would recommend them in white with a waterproof pad underneath."
2,Material,"Not a soft material, very yucky feeling.. kind of cheaply made, no elastic, which is good if you do not use it much since it will not dry out.. but with the material the way it is, I would go with a different brand sheet"
3,Just ok,"This fit the pack and play very nicely, but seemed thin and scratchy. We only use them at abuelita's house so I'm not sure how they'd handle washing from everyday use."
1,don't bother,"I bought this sheet because I believed everything should be ""form fitting"" if my son was to be in it - to prevent possible suffocation, choking....This sheet was so rough I could not lay my baby on it. After washing 3-4 times with loads of fabric softener - no difference.I used it once and it's been in the closet ever since.I ended up putting a thin blanket in the packnplay and tucking it into the sides instead. It was soft, and when my child was sleeping he didn't pull it out.If and when I use the pack and play as a playpen, I may pull the sheet out and try again. For the basinett - don't bother."
1,Color Bleeds,"We bought this and a couple other patterns... The first time my daughter had a leaky diaper, the color on the sheets ran and ruined her outfit. The sheets had been washed several times before this happened, too. Not only is that poor manufacturing, but I can only imagine how harmful the dye could have been to my babies skin if we hadn't noticed it right away."
1,Don't Waste $$ on these,I regret not following the advice of the majority of reviewers on this one. These really are terrible sheets. I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they're manufactured by the same company. Boy was I wrong. They don't fit the pad very well regardless if it's laying flat for the playpen or if it's set up for the bassinet. Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet doesn't stay put very well at all. They are also cheaply made. Thin isn't even the word. It's upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand. I'm going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere. As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet. The pad wipes down well and if i'm going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her. Since she's always wrapped in a blanket she doesn't mind going w/o the sheet.
4,you get what you pay for,"think most reviews are too harsh on this product. it's cotton. it's a sheet. nothing fancy. get over it. you are not placing your babies on rose petals. it's convienent, but don't go crazy - register for 2, that's all you'll need."
1,Bring out the sewing machine,"We received this white Pack 'n Play sheet as a shower gift. If I had spent my own money on it I would have returned it. It is so thin that it is almost transparent. It is rather stiff even after several washings. I expected it to be either pillowcase style (just slip it over the play yard base pad before putting it in the bottom) or at least have elastic corners. All it has is about a 1 1/2"" edge on the back side that is suppose to fit around the base pad. Because of this, it doesn't fit snug enough so it bunches up under the baby. If you have ANY sewing skills at all I would highly recommend getting some fabric and making some sheets yourself. It will be cheaper in the long run and you will probably be more satisfied."
2,"Not soft at all, even after you wash them","These sheets are not comfortable at all. I do use them as I have not found anything else. I just put a cloth diaper under my babies head and he lies on a sleep aid that prevents him from turning over onto his face, so he does not lie directly on the sheet. The shhets do not soften up even after you wash them. Jersey knit sheets would be alot nicer and more comfortable. I just can't find them for babies =(."
3,Not a tight fit,"Although the sheet feels ok to the touch and is very easy to get on and off, the ""fitted"" claim isn't so. It bunches and wrinkles. Not a very tight fit at all. I have even tried washing and drying at a high heat to shrink it, but to no avail.I am dissappointed that Graco makes these for their product and it is still a poor fit."
4,Great for all Playards,"We have the Travelin Tot Safari Playard and even though this sheet is made for Graco Pack n Plays, it's perfect for my son's playard also. I couldn't imagine putting him in the bassinet part without a sheet... I'm glad Graco came up with such a great product. It's best to have a few on hand for spit up's or leaky diaper's..."
1,Terrible sheets--don't waste your money,"These sheets are incredibly thin and cheap. The elastic isn't good, and the fabric is just not soft. We've bought several other brands, all of which were better than this stuff."
4,"The amazing last gasp of a band, and an era.","(Please note: Same review as below, with minor changes, but I wanted to get it under my name)This double LP set (originally, that is, ""back in the day""--it is a single CD) was the last album by an Animals configuration until the original band did the obligatory reunion album some years later. An album filled with excess, bombast and extended tunes, and I love every second of it. A great example of how the British invasion morphed into psychedelia and ultimately self-destructed. Highlights include their version of River Deep, Mountain High, which is a great companion to Tina Turner's, and their loving Bee Gees tribute, To Love Somebody. I just read a book named Animal Tracks which gives a great straightforward history of the Animals and useful background on this and all of their albums, and I recommend it for true fans of the group."

5,16 Tracks from a Truly Gifted Individual,"""Seasons of the Heart"" is the followup to Jane Ellen's debut CD, ""From My Heart."" Happy to say, it's every bit as beautiful as the first CD. Even more amazing, the 16 tracks that are heard on this disc were composed specifically for the disc.For the most part, this is pure Jane Ellen, playing her own compositions as only she can play them. However, there's a bit more this time. A few tracks contain very appropriate effects and/or accompaniment. ""My Gipsy Heart"" is a standout example, and is a surefire winner.This is music as it should be--if you've never heard Jane Ellen play, then what are you waiting for? Buy without hesitation!"
3,Analog Gameport Device,"I wanted a small HAND HELD steering device with a radio controller style interface and this is the closest thing I could find. It's much bigger than I wanted but this is all that's available. The most important thing here is that there is no mention that it is a game-port device! A game-port is usually included on some sound cards, so be sure you check that you have one. Also check if your operating system (O.S.) will support it and how to set it up. If you don't have a game-port you can get a USB converter. I suggest the Manhattan USB Game Port Adapter ($15). This is an inexpensive way to have a non-intrusive steering device that is not available anywhere and I hope somebody will make a drawer size wheel for us casual drivers out there!"
5,Best deal ever,"I bought my book from a private person by way of Amazon.com. The book was brand new and it had everthing I needed for my class, it was an extra bonus. The book was a lot cheaper than what the school wanted for it. It is very easy to understand and not only that but I like the way it is layed out. When I thought it was missing the workbook I contacted the seller to see if he had sent it, he had. I was very pleased that he responded right away. Turns out that wookbook was part of text. I would recommended the book and the transaction highly."
3,"Not a new idea, but good execution","The authors do a fine job expanding on the ideas of others. Savvy executives have known about this for years. I recall an article in USA Today back in 1996 or 1997 about some consultants who were peddling the same idea as corporate judo or ju jitsu. So while the idea is not new, they've done a good job developing an approach to capitalize on the chaos following mergers."
2,Poor Quality,"Poor Quality music...the music is there, but the quality is not what you would expect of a cd...i would never buy this brand of cd again"
1,Unreliable,"I have the SP3B system (which, I assume, is a based off this system). It worked at first, but now (a few months later) it blinks as if it's working, but it's not (my horses were breaking through it, and I tested the line). One thing I noticed is that the clicking sound it makes when it releases its voltage (as it did when we first set it up) isn't occurring.Very disappointed after spending over $100 on this product, and now I have to spend that much more to set up an AC charger to replace it."
1,Save your money,"Bought one and it lasted about 3 months. Sent it back to Zareba and they sent me another one. Light flashes, new battery, no output. Zareba wants another $55 to repair it. Told them to forget it."
2,Very weak,"I used this to charge a wire fence around a small garden. I decided on this model after doing an on-line consultation with a representative of Zareba, but I regret that I didn't purchase the 10 mile fence controller. The shock this one delivers is very weak compared to an older solar fence controller I had. I can't imagine it would even be noticeable on a 3 mile long fence."
3,Pepe Hole View to the Masters,"Good idea of painting like the Masters, but Susie only does a Pepe hole view of the Master's Art Piece. With a few, she does pick more than one section. She could have picked several section to demonstration that techniques and limit the number of artist instead. The section selected where not done as good as the Master's work, but the idea was good. A person could make a comparison between her work and the actual art piece and find the differences and make their own decision on what need to be done in selection of color and direction and length and type of brush stroke. However, she has the basic concept down. I mainly work in watercolor and am not very good with pastel. This will give me a chance to work on my skills in a different medium."
4,if you are an X's and O's technician - great book!,"The book has many many zone offenses. Some against specific zones and some good for any zone. They are mostly continuities. Very detailed descriptions for each offense, very thorough and effective. I adopted one zone offense for my 8th grade team and achieved immediate results."
5,Mae West's Biting Humor at It's Best,"Mae West's most entertaining film is also the first time in comic history I have ever seen an actor/actress deliver so many cutting one-liners and maintain an absolutely histerical timing and delivery. Ms. West shines as the wise-cracking Tira and delivers one of her most amusing and powerfully feminine performances. It is more than worth the watch; in fact, it is essential for any comic movie collection..."
3,You're getting what you paid for.,"I will admit first off that I don't have a 5.1 card yet, so my results could be drastically different if I did have one, but as of now I am mearly satisfied with these speakers. Sound quality is average but by no means excellent. Bass goes out very quickly so don't expect to listen to music very loud (this is something that probably won't change when I get the new card). Basically, don't expect to use these speakers for any reason other than sitting right in front of your computer and listening to music at a reasonable volume. If you plan on using these speakers as part of an overall sound system, you should probably spend a little more money and buy something with some more non-distorted wattage. Sorry to rain on your parade of 5 stars across the board, but I've definately had better speakers than these. Overall, I'd say my biggest problem is with the subwoofer, it gets distorted very easily. Don't plan on impressing anybody with your new monster system."
5,bible reading,I like the easy to read forum as well as the helpful noted by J. MacArthur.So give it a try.
5,Absolutely the best,It is hard to read through the bible each year and this new approach I really like. I gifted a copy to a friend that is a new Christian and she just can't stop talking about how much she is enjoying her daily reading and the explanations that accompany them. I would recommended it strongly to anyone wanting daily guided bible reading.
5,Great daily Bible reading!,"I was looking for a daily bible reading that had more then one scripture followed by a story by the author of the devotional. I was interested in something with a little more meat and less milk. This has fit the bill perfectly. It takes more then five minutes to read through the daily sections, but it is well worth it. The notes from MacArthur add to the understanding of the text. This is great for someone looking to get deeper into scripture!"
3,Among the Serbs Not Of The Serbs,"I read the book just after it was published and missed an opportunity to speak with the author at an appearance she made in Chicago. My only criticism is that the questions the author poses about the Serbian people and their situation during the war are never answered. I was waiting for some insight about the situation and some perspectives on solutions to the political problems in Belgrade. Nothing was answered or ever raised. We simply get a diary of small vignettes. If she really did meet all those people, I'm surprised that the author didn't have an answer to the question she posed about the Serbian people and their mindset. I sent her a note inviting her to research some of the writings by Bishop Nikolai Velimirovich, a Serbian Bishop, and survivor of the Holocaust. His take on the Serbian people, their faith and their tenacity would have explained everything to her. ""The Serbs will choose the difficult road because it is the right one, the Christian one."""
5,Beautiful music,I got this for my dad. It arrived early and he listens to it every time he gets in his truck
1,I find the title deceiving,"If I had read the reviews first, I would not have bought the book. I find the intimate sex details of the homosexual not reading material for me. I kept reading to see if the storyline changed but it only got worse. Sorry, but this is the first and last book by Dale Peck I will buy."
2,Book could have been written in 30 pages.,The book has an excellent point of view but could have been expressed in about 30 pages. Too much repetition. It did not need 194 pages.
3,Not for single mothers,"It's a nice book except it doesn't work if you are a single mother. There is a good portion of the book dedicated to memories of ""Dad,"" including when Mom and Dad met, when they were engaged, married, who Dad's parents are, and so on. If it were just a page or two I could work around this by pasting pictures on those pages but it really takes up quite a bit of the book. This isn't something you would know by reading the book's description or other reviews."
2,Unclear... I only lasted 3 chapters before switching,"I found the organization of the concepts in the book difficult to follow. I also found the explainations verbose. The answers seemed to be designed for someone who has very little web experience and very little Java experience. If you are experienced in both, you might become irritated with the length of the answers.I also tried the exams on the CD. The wording of the questions was imprecise. One question on the sample exam started with ""Which of the following options BEST defines..."" and finished with ""Choose all the apply"". How many ""best options"" are there?I would recommend the ""SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification"" by Manning. After three chapters in this book, I switched. I was very happy I did."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible!","..After his previous single ""Independent Girl"", it was a big shock for me to hear this der'mo!.."
5,fun resource,This book is filled with great resources for fun times with kids. It has activities that call on imagination and creativity.
2,Trader Development,"This book really is mistitled. Chaos theory for markets is not presented, so look elsewhere for that. The book does present a good theory for the psychology of trading such as ""traders differ on value but agree on price"" as motivation and explains the development of traders from novice, intermediate, and advanced (skip master and expert level)and the goals for each level. Unfortunately, the methodology for trading with a Chaos background is not touched upon.Good filler read for background on trading and personal development. Poor on methodology for trading with Chaos. Perhaps Mr. Williams had an epiphany and contends all trades are done in Chaos, so traders should relax. To borrow a line from another author, ""some trades will, some trades won't, so what, next trade please."""
2,Fractals in review,"As an avid student of Chaos Theory and Fractals, I found this book to be similar to his other one. Williams eludes to using fractals in his analysis but makes no reference to fractal dimensions, Koch curves, monsters or any of the original theories as proposed by Mandelbrot. He does present some scaling principles and their application to Elliot Waves, but this is under the assumption that the Elliot Wave is correct or that you believe in it. I do agree with some of the money flow theories Williams proposes, which is probably the most clearly explained and substantiated part of his trading theoriey. I recommend ""Fractals and Scaling in Finance"" by Mandelbrot and for software, ""Fractal Finance"" by Tetrahex. Both of these follow a similar system, although Fractal Finance does use a MACD which appears similar to Williams."
2,"All pulp, all the time","This was my introduction to the works of Guy N. Smith,and it was something of a surprise. I've read period'shudder pulps' of the 1930s, and this is probably as closeas you can get to a contemporary shudder pulp feel.Lots more sex, more explicit violence, and an angsty,noirish feel. The hodge-podge of occult traditions, allthrown together with vigor and a dash of bitters (punintended) make for a potent cocktail, albeit with a nastyaftertaste.Overall, it reminded me of my brother the college Englishprofessor describing a popular-market espionage thriller -""if this book were a CD, Tipper Gore would want to put asticker on it."""
4,Very nice set,Cute pattern and great for every day. Works beautifully with the red accessories in my kitchen. Great price compared to competitors especially with free super saver shipping. Not sure why it took a whole week for them to leave the shipping location but once they were shipped they arrived quickly and in perfect condition. But be aware that although the plates and bowls are made in the US the mugs are made in China.
1,Ripoff - beware of this exaggerated product,"I've bought their 20% Kona and 80% Tropical blend pods before and really enjoyed the taste. I bought these because it appeared they were the same. The box even looked the same. Indeed, it stated on the box that it was a 20%-80% blend. Inside, however, the pods are actually 10% Kona and 90% Tropical blend. You can't even taste or smell the Kona coffee. This is a bait and switch item that everyone should ignore."
5,Dan Appleman treads where others only glance,"""This eBook is a collection of 7 original columns written by best-selling author Dan Appleman for Pinnacle's Hardcore Visual Basic.NET newsletter.""With those opening words in the eBook, you'd get the impression that the subject matter coverage would be light and/or shallow, like articles usually are... but Dan has really done a great job of delving into the depths of Cryptography, .NET String memory referencing, how to properly benchmark .NET code, etc. He's also added a few things to these versions of the articles that didn't appear in the original newsletter, so even if you own the original copies of the newsletter, you'll still want to get this eBook for the additional content.I consider this eBook a ""must have"" for anyone that is a .NET developer. Nowhere else will you get such expert knowledge at such a low cost... and you won't have to wade through a hundred pages of fluff to get to the good stuff."
