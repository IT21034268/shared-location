1,the dvd is better,"the songs sound much better on the bonus dvd than they do on the cd. the only good songs are the singles (""st. anger,"" ""frantic,"" and ""the unnamed feeling."") the rest...no. metallica is still a great live band though, don't get me wrong, but i think they should release a greatest hits and call it quits after that."
3,Love It or Hate It...It's Metallica,"**UPDATE** - Although the album was fun for a spell, I'm rather bored with it now. This won't go down as one of their best, but I can listen to it vs. Load and Reload. I'm afraid after hearing a preview of a newer song that their new stuff will again suck salty chocolate bawlz.If you want 80's hair metal solos, go elsewhere. It's definitely different than anything they've done, and is an improvement after the Load disasters. Still, this album falls short in variety and I don't think it will stand the test of time.If you want Metallica of old, don't buy it, this is something totally different."
1,I use to be a Metallica fan,"This album is garbage and this is why.Lars's horrible use of this high tom drum throughout is enough to want to bury your head in the sand.Robert's barking into the mic ""you pinch one out, you pinch one out"" or whatever he is attempting to sing in St. Anger.James lyrics have gone from Bad to worse and do you think they could change tempo more through out this album? This completed album sounds like a rough start recording ummmmmmm, producer?Kirk was cool and kept it tight but really had little or nothing to work with.Question: Was this album written to satisfy contractual obligations with the record company and you just didn't care? Or you knew your core fans would purchase any crap you decided to put out? I use to be a core fan.MC"
2,banginonacooffeecan,Lars quit bangin' on a coffee can. You ruined the whole album. Go sue Napster again. I'm madly in anger with you!!!!
1,St. Anger Recored In A Bathroom!,"What is Metallica's problem!? The garage band stuff is bad enough! Icons!? This cd brings their status to wash ups! The sound of the cd is terrible! The entire cd is full of the drums being louder then the actually gutiars! Its dull! The songs aren't great, because its supposed to be a mosh ablum! Metallica.. those MTV kids grew up! Write better music and don't record it in a restroom! Only buy this cd if your wanting to waste money!"
2,Weird one.,"Well....my expectations were high when I opened the CD and played it for the first time.I still am not quite sure what to think of the music itself, but the sound is awful - almost nothing left of Lars' once so powerful drum sound or Kirk's guitar wizardry, like on '...and justice for all', my favorite album, and others.Certainly the guys have grown up but this album is far from what seemed to have been promised and what I had expected.Still....I hope that I kinda start liking it after listening to it several times so the money wasn't completely wasted."
4,+ 1/2 stars....I don't know what happened.....,"I once hated this album, shelved it forever (or so I thought), and wrote a one star review here a while later. Then Some Kind Of Monster came on VH1 about four days ago, and I decided to watch it, hoping to see what kind of crack James, Lars, & the boys were smoking during the making of this album. I sat through the whole thing and enjoyed it, but above all, I had this urge to pop in St. Anger, seeing if it'd be any better than when I first listened to it.Interestingly enough, I actually thought it wasn't too bad. I listened to it again, and it was even better the second time. I kept listening to it, and here I am with a four-and-a-half star review.Now, how did that come to be? I'm not exactly sure; I guess it just grew on me. Sue me for being different, I guess; I'm just letting the anti-Metallica trolls know that I kinda like this album now. I still think that the DVD is useless, though...."
1,Saint Anger: the patron saint of steaming dung,"Save your money and don't buy this album. I got it on sale for 10 bucks at best buy and after listening to it I knew I'd been robbed. For Metallica, this is the musical equivalent of whatVan Halen gave us on Van Halen III. Something seems to happen when rock musicians go through rehab and therapy- there 'music' becomes steaming poop. I think it's great when anybody beats addiction and comes to terms with personal demons and all that, but a law needs to be passed that states no rock musician can be allowed to release an album for at least four years after their therapy and recovery 'stage' has happened. The bonus DVD isn't worth jack. It's just them playing these crappy songs in a small room straight through.St. Anger is sure to make you very Angry. As in, ""Why theexpletive expletive expletive did I buy this smelly turd? I'm Angry!""Don't give these jokers your money. It only encouragesthe crapiness."
2,I feel betrayed...,"St. Anger. Ouch. This has got to be the singularly most disappointing CD I've ever listened to. The aggression of the guitars and bass are unchanged (props to the new bassist), and as good as ever. However, the drums are tweaked in such a way that the snare drum sounds more like a steel drum. Not good. And James Hetfield, my God, what the hell is wrong with him? It seems as if hetfield is trying to be an older fred durst. it sounds awful. The lyrics are so boringly repetitive and the overall sound so cacophonous, I thought for a moment that I was listening to some Kylie Minogue-Andrew WK collaboration.If you are a Metallica fan in any degree, I STRONGLY suggest you listen this CD before you buy it. I hated this CD."
1,"sad, but true.","I went into this hoping for the best, but I have to honestly say that St. Anger is a steaming pile of monkey dung.*the melodies are terrible and meandering.*the drums sound out of tune and are recorded too loud.*there are barely any guitar solos*James' vocals are off key and devoid of any passion*the songs are too long, the tempo changes seemed forced and unnatural for the songs*Bob Rock's bass playing is buried in the mix (thank god)*the lyrics are REALLY bad - and music like this should have hard rhymes (and not that gangsta ""hard rhyme"" thing either) - the lyrics that James has written are just weak.how the mighty have fallen."
1,REALITY CHECK FOR THE METALLICA NATION,"Well we have St. Anger here and personally I think he needs to leave. I can appreciate Metallica's attempt of doing something new sounding yet while trying to go back to their roots, QUESTION? did the roots begin somewhere between the black album and load? This album sounds like a cover band singing songs that came from the illegitamate child of ride the lighning and load in a cruddy night club. Take the title track it starts off rockin then the lyrics start WHAT????????????? The Metallica nation needs to declair a state of emergency! Because I Think we have a disaster on our hands! How about this Metallica fans Lets bury our ""Hero Of The Day"" No Pun Intended, buy the greatest hits cd when it comes out and move on, because Metallica is gone and they are never coming back! Need more proof? check out echohead. Even Jason Newsted (Not an orginial member) knows Metallica is history!"
1,St Anger,"This is one of the worst ""metal"" cds i have ever heard in my entire life. Everything Metallica has ever released i have somewhat enjoyed, but this... This is an abomination to metal. Terrible drums, terrible vocals, terrible lyrics, terrible riffs, bad guitar playing, no bass sound... There is nothing good about this cd. There are no good songs on it. I don't know what these guys were thinking when they released this peice of crap. A bunch of 10 year olds could write better songs than these. The lyrics are so lame. I think James hetfield needs to get back on the bottle, so this NEVER happens again."
1,what a crappy album,"They were trying to make somthing new and different from Load/Reload and their earlier stuff, but they failed somewhere along the road. The drums especially sound really bad, like hitting on garbage cans, like Slipknot and other nu metal crap. Really they have to get back to their roots of the mid 80's to early 90's when they could be called one of the best heavy metal bands alongside Megadeth and Anthrax, etc."
1,"They're trying, but the first step should be to fire Bob Rock.","I read a one star review of kill em all (written by a complete poser named Avril Lavigne#1fan) that said St. Anger was like Simple Plan crossed with Limp Bizkit. Considering that Metallica started out as Iron Maiden crossed with Motorhead with a little bit of the Misfits thrown in, that says more than any rant by a fan of the first three albums can ever say. Lars sounds even worse than he did in ..And justice for all, James sounds like he's clenching his teeth, and Kirk... wait a second, where'd Kirk go? This might as well just be the Hetfield and Ulrich show! Long live Ride the Lightning, a REAL album for REAL metalheads!!!!"
2,PONG! ................PONG!!,"Did Lars buy a Toys R Us drum kit? Annoying tin can snare drumming absolutely ruins an already questionable album. He could have added that sound to one song, or a change up, or something, but not the whole thing! Some actual lead guitar would be cool to break things up a little. I tried to be a supporter through the Load phase, but I'm sorry to say that this is not worthy of millions of pieces of plastic being wasted to record this. Please re-record this without the unhooked snare drum let us trade-in the first attempt."
1,Wha!!!!!!,"WHAT!!! is exactly right!!!!!How could you metalica! The most anticapted album ever turns out to be the worst album of the year!!!! Thanks alot! I wasted 16 bucks for this garbage! I hope you guys are happy you damn sell outs! The only good song in this crap that we call an album is st anger it self and frantic but the rest. CRAP!!!Thanks alot metalica you made me lose my respect in you.If you want a true metal masterpiece get master of puppets, Black album,and justice for all.At least thats when the true gods of metal were good now theySUCK!I SPIT IN THIS ALBUM! THANKS ALOT!!!!1"
1,Absolutely Broke My heart,"I have loved Metallica since the 80's. I absolutely love their earlier work and I even like load and reload. However, they need to name this one Unload. I waited and waited reading the reviews. I was so pumped up that they had actually returned to their roots. And then, I put it in the CD player and found that it sounded nothing like their older stuff. Could someone please point out exactly which of their older stuff had no guitar solo and featured Lars banging on pots and pans. The fact that I spent money on this does suck, but what is really disheartening is that Metallica is no more. That is what sux the most."
4,Back to Heavy,"Goes back to Master and Justice. Could be heavier. Couldn't stand it if these guys just did the same albums, different titles. Can't wait for the next one."
1,"Half a star actually, if that..","As an artist myself I am well aware how difficult it is to utilise the mind to express the spirit in such a way that the artwork conveys meaning in an engaging and moving way. This is something that Metallica have excelled in in the past and in which they fail miserably in here. This album is dire.We can only speculate why they have done this. It may be some sort of statement, yes, much like Damien Hirst's preserved animals. But you would not want a tank containing a preserved cow in your living room any more than you would want to listen to the hopeless album that is 'St.Anger' on a regular basis.It really is very challenging indeed to get through even one of these awful songs. The guys from Metallica are capable of far better than this."
1,PEEEUUUU,"Five year wait and we get this? Come on there isnt one song on here. Its like over 75 minutes of noisy guitar, garbage-can sounding drums and vocals from Hetfield who I think should retire along with the band. Lars, with that arogant ego of his has helped in the destruction. Losing Newsted to Ozzy didnt help but who wants to stay on a sinking ship? This band, once a fabulous and simply awesome group is now...dare I say it? Yes I shall...DEAD!This coming from a Long time Metallica fan"
1,pathetic,The new album lacks coherence. The sound is raw. It only serves the necessities of a band with serious internal problems. No wonder Jason Newsted left the band. A DVD has been included for the sole purpose of covering up the undisputed fact that this album is bad. S& M was amazing. The fans were expecting an album which could surpass the previous one. They failed. A kid might like this. But a fan who idolizes the excellent contents of their previous albums will not. DO NOT BUY THIS....
3,Anger missing some real anger,"I have always been a huge Metallica fan and while I found parts of this album to be refreshing and almost true to the old school Metallica albums, it was lacking something. Gone are the old guitar solos that used to highlight 9 and 10 minutes of music. Also absent is the extraordinary drumming that can only be from Lars...not a bad cd for a true Metallica fan, but if this is your first Metallica experience, go back and get something older!"
2,Ever heard of mixing?,"Here's the problem with this CD. It's mixed horribly. I heard they were listening to a lot of Meshuggah so that's where their new sound comes from. Well, Meshuggah uses a mixing board. Go listen to ""Gods of Rapture"" and be amazed that they sounded like Metallica could have now. And they sounded like that 10 years ago. Basically, the songs on St. Anger aren't bad. If we were to hear them and someone told us that it was some new band, I think most people would like it better. But with Metallica, we all expect something more. And Justice for All, Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, these are all great! Those albums all sounded the same and yet they were completely different. Basically, I, like so many others. are disappointed. Come on Metallica, you are capable of so much more. I still have faith that they will be great again...someday"
1,Trying to keep up with the times...,"Compairing this album to other bands that are coming out today this is a good record. But by Metallica standards this album is horrible. The band has lost there golden touch. The druming has an over-bearing feel and it seems to be mis-directed. The bass lines, are hard to make out. I don't however think that James Headfield's voice is still going fine, I saw them live in July and he sounded better than ever. I also can understand why there aren't any guitar solo's - because they want to be more current with the music today. While listening to this record you can tell that Metallica is trying to fit in with the new-style bands that don't usually do flashy guitar stuff.I think we all want our old Metallica back... this band needs to realize that they can't just stop and try to become more modern in there outlook they have to keep the formula that made them great... this album is sad."
1,Holy [Crud],"This is embarrassing. Is this CD a joke? It looks like Metallica made a CD so bad no one would want to trade it on the internet. Wow. James' lyrics and singing just don't mesh with this ""new sound."" I was expecting, the Black Album meets Ride the Lightning. This is just heavy mush."
1,what the heck?,"horrible vocals, horrible drums, very repetitive, this just plain [isn't good]! that obnoxious ring of the high tuned snare drum gets very old. production is nothing to be proud of. the only things worthy of even half a star is the fact that the monotenous guitar leads are gone. thank god. do your self a favor and dont buy this album. it stinks."
2,Metallica's worst-ever album,"Many people trash the Black Album and Load, but they were both good albums. Load was perhaps a little self-indulgent, but it was still an excellent body of work. Reload, in my view, marked Metallica's first real decline. It was simply the Load offtakes and should never have seen the light of day.The new album, St Anger, is just pitiful. The songs are garbage, the production is garbage.Thank goodness we older metalheads have a new Iron Maiden album to listen to this year ... Dance of Death. Unlike St Anger, which is Metallica's worst-ever record, Maiden's new disc is their best ever."
3,Thank God for the DVD...,"I hated this album, after listening to the cd. The production is awful. Larz' drums sound like he's playing a trash can (very annoying). Thankfully, they included the DVD of live performances in the studio of all the songs. This sounds MUCH better! I sold my cd, and kept the DVD.Regarding the songs, well, they're unlike anything Metallica has done before. I can't really compare them to anything from their past. There's alot of cool riffs. But, no solos from Kirk (unbelievable). Lyrically, this album is not that great. Some of the lyrics are downright silly (check out ""Frantic"", tick tick tick tock...e.t.c). Not James' best effort, for sure.It's hard to recommend this cd, based on the silly lyrics, poor production and no guitar solos (one of Metallica's trademarks, listen to their old stuff). However, there are some good things here (no ballads, cool riffs...e.t.c.). I think you'll just need to hear it for yourself, and make up your own mind."
3,Metallica,All my friends hate everything after And Justice for All. I think the black CD was okay and Load and Reload I loathe and re-loathed. I don't dislike this CD however. The reason is I think it sounds a lot like their Garage Days CD. It's not as aggresive as their earlier stuff and the lyrics seem to be lacking anything with even a sliver of meaning. But I can enjoy it. It's not garbage.
1,Thank God I Didn't Buy This!,I got this burnt and thought it was HORRIBLE...Still haven't changed my mind. I love 'Some Kind Of Monster' but the rest is HOPELESS. NO-ONE BUY THIS. I HATE METALLICA NOW.
1,The album that killed Metallica??,"I've listened to this album several times, and read the reviews. Some people are calling this album 'genius'. I can't believe they could listen to Master Of Puppets or Justice or even the Black album and still say that.1) This album has terrible production. My first thought was ""why didn't they get the Master of Production, Bob Rock to produce, then I read the credits... he did produce it! I've heard local bands that have better sounding discs.2) The lyrics are terrible. ""Invisible Kid"" is a joke. Most of the lyrics sound like they were written in an hour.3) Kirk's talents are wasted on this album. Nary a solo to be found. I wouldn't blame him if he followed Jason Newkid and left.4) Lars, how could you and Bob be listening to the drum tracks and both nod your heads??? Awful.The complex harmonies, crafted lyrics, ball-busting drum sound, layered guitars, wailing solos, excellent production, all gone. Good-Bye Metallica, it's been fun..."
5,Gives hope to the metal world,"Metallica has been around for 20+ years and they have never disappointed me in any way. As I was growing up, so were they and the one thing that I always loved is that they never stayed the same, yet they always stayed true to their roots. I work in a meat department at a grocery store where day in day out everything is the same, but I get to bring in music to help me get through the day and Metallica is what I mainly listen to. I have tried listening to other bands but they have disappointed me so much that I always turn back to this band. This album has so much energy and the feeling I got when listening to the album was that this is a band that has come a very long way and they are not done. Thank you metallica, for always being there for me. Here's hoping you are around for another 20+ years. Here is hoping that other metal bands will see the lesson you have been teaching for oh so very long."
2,Tin cans and muddy sounds for all,"Oh how the mighty have fallen. Its sometimes sad when bands say things that make them look even dumber than before ""we went back to what we did best"" to be honest there isn't too much of anything good on this disc. They sound like a bad nu metal band that plays very fast and sloppy. James sounds like a mix between Danzig and my [rear-end]. Sorry but save you money and get something better than this [garbage] session. The words are a joke, the drum sound is a joke, and the guitars are a joke. If you wanna laugh then this is for you"
1,failed attempt at a raw & hard sound,"Metallica attempts to return to their original raw and hard sound, but comes up short with St. Anger. As a fan, I've been trying really hard to like this album, to give it a chance, but unfortunately I don't think its going to happen. I've listened to it all the way through about a dozen times now and still can't find a song that I like. The drums sound so shallow, as if Lars used tin cans and recorded it in a bathroom. Every song literally sounds the same, there is none of the former lyrical and musical poetry and diversity. There is lots of anger, lots of yelling, lots of dull power chords and boring beats, and nothing that represents Metallica's true talent which I know they possess but apparently put aside for this one. Maybe it is the influence of the new bassist, I don't know, but they did something terribly wrong with this album. Buyer beware."
5,Can understand the negative reviews...,"I can see where those who dislike this album are coming from. Lars DOES sound like he's banging on tin cans. This record will NOT get a lot of airplay. There are no pop songs like Hero of the Day.However, I judge an album purely by its raw brilliance and never has Metallica kicked this much A$$ since the days of Kill em All and Master of Puppets, the days of Cliff Burton. The review below is wrong, Cliff WOULD be proud, what other band would be this raw, this pure, this HEAVY after 20 YEARS!!!The only slow song on the album is Unnamed Feeling, but this along with Some Kind of Monster, St Anger, My World, and All Within My Hands are definitely the high points. The greatness of this album is subtle and I only hope it will gain esteem with time, as all the best do."
1,Caca Metal at its finest!,"Poopy metal. I used to idolize these guys when Justice came out years ago. It feels like blasphemy knocking their work at all. But damn, I'm not feeling any of this underproduced garbage. The songs are long and heavy but they are repetitive riffs that really didn't impress me at all and the production is terrible. I have given this disc many times to grow on me but all to no avail. I gave up on them after the black album. Somebody told me this release was ""heavier"". I rolled the dice and lost. Download this bad boy. Its not worth a buy. RIP Metallica. I still have Justice,Puppets, Lightning and Kill to remember you with. Good riddance!"
1,Don't bother,"It isn't old (pre-Black album) and it isn't new (Black album, Load, Reload, etc.) Metallica. This is 75 minutes of Lars incessantly smashing cymbals and James droning on in the same key. No memorable guitar riffs, no power chords, nothing that you'll be able to recall in a day. ""St. Anger"" lacks the energy and venom of Metallica's earlier days and the polish of their later work, and as a result will most likely be a severe disappointment for both new and old fans. But don't take my word for it: wait a couple of weeks...check out in-store samples...get your friends' opinions. Just do your wallet a favor and don't make this an impulse buy."
3,somewhat disappointing,"First off as said before, this cd sounds nothing like the Metallica of old whether it be Load, Master of Puppets, etc. Yeah its heavy and somewhat of a decent record but to be honest I was disappointed with the album. To me it sounds as though they are once again trying to fit into the main stream rock stuff as they did with Load, however Load was actually good. They are now detuning their guitars like everyone and their brother. Another disappointing factor is that their is really no soloing on the album. Their are no killer leads as would be expected from Metallica. Overall the album is decent but a lame attempt at trying to sound like everyone else."
5,Masterpiece!,"That is the only word I found to describe this album. I wonder if there was ever another album that kept so many people talking and arguing about. Personally, I love this album! It has catchy riffs, fast-paced drums and awesome lyrics. I think of this album as the new Kill'em All, and this is just a new start for the band. It's amazing how after so many years this band can kick so much bum!"
1,SOMETHING TO WIPE WITH. . .,"IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THIS IS THE SAME BAND THAT PRODUCED SUCH CLASSICS AS ""MASTER OF PUPPETS"" OR ""RIDE THE LIGHTNING"". THIS NEW OFFERING DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE ANY ""REAL"" MUSICAL SKILL AND EVEN LOWERS THE STANDARDS OF MUSIC. THE SONGWRITINING IS VERY, VERY WEAK, LIKE TODAY'S RECENT SONIC OFFENSES THAT KEEP POLUTING THE AIRWAVES. ANY IDIOT WHO THINKS THIS IS GOOD IS SIMPLY DEAF OR SIMPLY TOO DUMB TO KNOW DIFFERENT. THE TROUBLE IS, THE TITLE ISN'T FITTING AT ALL. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED: ""SOMETHING TO WIPE WITH"". METALLICA IS DEAD AND THIS ONE SEALS THEIR GRAVE. THEY EVEN KNOW THEIR NEW STUFF [STINKS]. WATCH THEM LIVE, THEY HARDLY PLAY ANYTHING FROM THIS ONE."
2,Tragic Disappointment,"having been a metallica fan when Kill 'Em All had Am I Evil on it, i was sadly disappointed to hear the discord presented on this album. the artistry and tightness of sound on previous metallica efforts is sadly lacking here and as much as it pains me to say this, i don't like the much of music on this album.the lyrics are still powerful. the boys' writing is still intelligent...not as thought provoking as MoP or Creeping Death but still a thinking person's lyrics. it's the composition that leaves much to be desired.i'm going to be listening again to the album but the hook's not there. the fluidity of master musicians and the sheer brilliance of arrangement don't seem to be present on St. Anger. breaks my heart to say it...but it's not one of their best efforts."
2,"Grew tried of it quickly, songs too long...","Ok when I first got it I liked it. I grew tired of it pretty quickly though. Metallica needs to do like KISS and have a farewell tour (or two) and quit making records, they have milked it long enough!the songs on this Album are WAY too long.Invisible Kid - 8.5 MinutesSome kind of Monster - 8.5 MinutesSt. Anger - 7.5 MinutesAll Within My Hands - Almost 9 D*mn Minutes"
2,"And, mind you, two stars is me being VERY generous.....","I really think Metallica needs to stop making records. It's depressing. And even more depressing because I remember putting this album on (because a girl I was dating let me borrow it) at 3 in the morning while I was driving in my car and the first track was actually pretty good. I was....surprised. Wow. Might this album be good? The first two songs are pretty good! And even the third is kinda okay. And then it stopped. The rest of the songs are worse than Load and I didn't think that was possible. Metallica was amazing. They will go down in history as one of the most influential bands of the 80s and 90s. They can stop now. They don't need to make any more ""records"" so Lars can go buy another 5 million dollar painting. However the first 3 songs are pretty good so I'm giving it 2 stars."
3,CD is bad. DVD is decent.,"I originally gave this release an extremely negative one star review. That was before I listened to the DVD, though. The DVD is ok, and since I would give the DVD three stars I have to give the release as a whole three stars.The CD is terrible. I don't need to go into why; there are plenty of other negative reviews here which sum it up. Basically I can't listen to the CD at all because the snare is so annoying."
1,BIG Disappointment!,"OK, I tried over and over to like this but I can't. I have been a Metallica fan since the 80's. I grew up on them. What they did I did. Anything that came out with their name on it I bought it. The last couple CDs were going down hill and I really hoped this one was going to be a big ""F"" you for all the crap they got over the last few years but sadly it wasn't. The worst part is the singing. What is James trying to do?!?! Only reason I bought this CD was because it was on sale and came with a DVD. After owning it for a few months and still not being able to like it, I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. I even had free tickets to their latest concert during the summer and took a pass."
1,I'd rate this album zero stars if it was possible!,"Metallica should be ashamed of themselves. When the Black album came out, it was a different sound, but at least it was good. I threw this cd out of my car window. Talking to other people about this album proved that I'm not the only one who feels this way. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU ARE A METALLICA FAN! You'll be as disappointed as I was."
3,A nice try for Altern- llica,"This album does have a great sound but it is just not Metallica. And so what if I am stuck in the 80's, at least I know there first album was NOT the Black album as one of my younger friends seems to think. Metallica stopped being Metallica after And Justice. I knew once I saw One on MTV, I knew they had sold out and it was over. Yet St Anger will appeal to most fans out there. It has some very powerful songs and some that are not so powerful. At any rate, if you think this is like the old stuff, dont buy it. If you want something that is different than the last three albums, buy it."
2,Just A Joke!,"What happened? It seems like Hetfield et co. abandoned the bona fide Metallica sound after the boxed money-maker of ""LIVE SHEE-IT"". Clearly the ""LOAD"" brothers did not make the grade.As for ""St. Anger"", it looks like Hetfield was released from rehab and noticed that Linkin Park seemed to be the sound of the day (carpe diem THAT, baby!) and decided to jump on a bandwagon. So what you've got is, you've got these elder statesmen of heavy rock making fools of themselves by emulating musicians who were still riding BigWheels when ""Kill Em All"" first made the scene.If this is the direction in which they're headed, Metallica should have the stones to bow out gracefully like Mustaine did."
1,Metallica has finally lost it.,"I've been a Metallica fan for a long time, and I like all of their albums (including Load and ReLoad.) So after being jerked around by the band for the better part of two years I finally had new Metallica that i could bring home and enjoy. Boy was I wrong. This album is terrible. Jame's vocals sound like he's sitting on the crapper, and the background vocals are awful. And last but certainitely not least did Kirk Hammitt even play on this record?? Metallica should hang it up if this is all they have left."
1,Is Kirk even still in this band,"This album is just terrible. Very repetitive. Lyrics are bad. New metallic drum sound would have been cool if used sparingly, but not on every song. And could we have even one decent guitar solo please . . ."
1,Metallica: Worst Album Ever,"As someone else stated, I couldn't put zero so I give the album 1 star. I have never been more disappointed in an album in my entire life. Metallica claimed that they were returning to their roots....unfortunately they only did it for 10 seconds at a time. The songs change pace so much that you can't keep up with them. James sounds like he's singing in his ""Nothing Else Matter's Voice"" instead of his ""Creeping Death"" voice for the whole album. If this is the kind of work that Metallica is going to produce, then they should just call it quits. As a Metallica fan, I have retired."
4,So So metallica cd,If you are a Metallica fan then you will most likely be buying this cd just because you like the band. This cd is a lot different then a lot of there other cds. They sound a lot different. The words don't seem to go with the music they play. That is really the only complaint i have. Other then that it is a pretty well done cd and comes with a bonus dvd. This cd is definitly worth the money the dvd shows the recording of all 11 tracks of the cd. I don't think anyone will give this cd 5 out of 5 stars. This is not there best album but still good if you like metallica.
3,Where is Metallica?,"I was expecting this cd for 6 years, thought It will be an expectacular album... I got wrong.I recomend this album only if you want to hear something new about pure trash... but this is not Metallica.There are certain facts I rejected from the beginning.1- Where are the guitar solos?We know Kirk Hammett, one of the masters of guitar nowadays, we could expect amazing and fast solos, but this time, he offered only a set of bitter and bad riffs... ok, riffs are ok for headbanging, but too simple.2- What is Lars Ulrich playing?It's not a drum, I think is a garbage can, or that it's what it seems... but Lars improved very well on playing.3- James Hetfield was writting the lyrics?Don't think so... he lost his personal way to write (Master of Puppets, for example)...he offered us a couple of simple lyrics, no more....This album is great in the way of Thrash Metal, but, Metallica isn't that way, they are masters, hope the next album will be a masterpiece."
1,What?,"This cd is missing something fundamental. I am not sure what it is, but it is not there.Could be the complete cliche lyrics. The lyrics do not make the music, but they can help. Total lack of any coherent chorus that you can either tap your feet to, or scream along with ... the pointless meandering of the songs are annoying.This band just seems to be looking for something, and not finding it.I wish I could like this cd... I was really anticipating something more than this, and it just didn't get it done. At all. There is not one song on this outing that is worth paying any attention to.complete airbag. St. Yawn."
3,Not the greatest album but lets give them a little credit,"Listen, I along with many other people think this album was a failure on Metallica's part. I think that for many regular bands not up to Metallica's level, an album like this would be a huge success but not for Metallica. We've all heard what Metallica can sound like when they collaborate all of their thoughts and effort into an album. I also have a bone to pick with all of the people that say the black album [was terible]. The black album was one of their best albums. I'm not the only one who thinks this either. This album just so happened to go diamond which means 12 million plus other people feel the same way i do. I think we can all expect the next metallica album to sound like there old stuff we know and love and not a failed attempt to be heavy metal."
2,"What happened? (A short, to the point review)","I usually don't bag on Metallica like many who miss the old days of Master of Puppets, etc. Actually, my favorate stuff of theirs has been the last few albums. HOWEVER, this album is truly terrible. I would not recommend that you buy it. There are no good songs on the entire CD."
1,Metallica SUX,How bad do you have to be to have your Bass player leave to join a band with little kids?I was hoping to write a review that would piss off everybody. But it looks like everybody else hates this St Garbage album as much as I do. I used to like Metallica until they started crying about Napster. Lars is a retard. But it wasn't just the Napster thing that made me hate them. It was their fans. Probably the biggest white trash fan base of all time.Therefore their music reminded me of their long haired smelly fans so I begain to hate it.
1,I WAITED 5 YEARS FOR THIS !!!!!!!!,metallica came up with a great plan to stop people from downloading their music for free... have it suck! the cd is beyond words it so bad and the dvd is plain boring. it would be more entertaining to watch a cat use a litter box than waste your time and money on this turd. metallica should be ashmened of themselves.
1,One of the worst albums Ive ever listened to.,Normally I like Metallic a lot but I must say this album just sucks.Its hands down one of the worst albums Ive ever had the misfortune of buying.I can honestly say that Marilyn Mansons ridiculous debut album Portrait Of An American Family is better because that at least is amusing and it had about 4 good songs.But I must say that I didnt like any of the songs on this piece of crap album.There isnt even any variety at all.All the songs sound the same and thats why I hate it.Its just a waste of money to buy a seemingly endless album with absolutely no good songs on it.I hope Metallica are ashamed of themselves for releasing this disaster.
1,Here's the Problem.,"Up until the ""Black"" album, Metallica used to make albums where EVERY song was well written. Then they made ""Load"" and ""Reload"", which have about 5 decent songs between the two albums. ""Garage Inc."" was just sad. My biggest complaint about ""St. Anger"" is this: It's not BAD...It's just not GOOD. There are NO memorable Metallica songs...there isn't even a decent radio hit. If ""St. Anger"" is the best they can offer, they should just give up. As for me, I need to go listen to ""Master of Puppets"" to recover...."
5,The sound of metal!!,"If you are the type of rock/metal fan who expects the unexpected and wishes to be challenged, St Anger is for you. Metallica leads the way yet again, with a full-on raging assault of intense riffery and complex songs. They have gone where a commercially successful band seldom goes and for the first time layed bare the music tools that make-up their own unique sound. This album spits tacks over all that is fake and generic in the current rock/metal climate and proves Metallica are still the best in the business. After many listens, the raw unproduced sound is a refreshing change and the songs get more and more interesting. The best tracks are St Anger, The Unnamed Feeling and All Within My Hands. If you're a Metallica fan and hate this album, then you haven't given it the time it deserves."
3,Not as Bad as Everyone Says,"I really don't understand why everyone hates this album so much. It's really not that bad. At least it rocks unlike their last two albums. I'm not even a metallica fan and I kind of like it. I'm in to real death metal like bloodbath, decapitated and deicide. When this album came out at least they tried to rock it a little while getting back to their garage/metal early 1983 roots. I actually kinda like lar$ drum sound; it sounds sort of like my own drum set. Granted I haven't put new heads on my drums for like a year. All I'm saying is if you haven't heard this album borrow it from a friend or down load it off the internet or something, you might actually like it."
1,Total Crap,"(...) This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever heard. The music sucks, the playing sucks, and the singing sucks. And justice for all was the last of the good stuff. The Black album was commercial but it had some strong songs which kept it out of the crap pile. Every studio album since them has been a big piece of trash. James and Lars had their egos take over and now Metallica is washed up commercial money grubbers. You want to hear something great, check out Megadeth..The System Has Failed. That is an excellent album."
1,Worst Metallica CD ever,"I was all excited to buy the new Metallica CD; however, after giving it a listen I have decided that this is the worst Metallica CD ever. I'm a die hard Metallica fan, but this CD does not sound like them at all. Gone is all the deeper meaning in their songs, gone is the guitar work that is like art. I think that because they have cleaned up the wanted to prove that they could still rock hard core. Well the result is a Cd that is only good for the trash. This is not a typical Metallica CD and I personally am very disapointed"
1,R.I.P. MetallicA...,"ok, I've been a hardcore metallica fan since 9 years ago...my generation was a bit behind Metallica (so most of us listened to Nirvana and so on) but whatever, I enjoyed until the 5th album...Load...gee, that was a good example of how to waste my money down the drain. ReLoad & Garage...ok, they're getting older and older. S & M...can't say it sucked too bad...HOWEVER. Metallica LOST its amazingness now, They're gone...gees, Jason Newstead was pretty good actually (some say since Clifford was gone Metallica lost it, but it's my personal taste that Jason was good in a different way)...this new guy in S(hi)t. Anger doesn't know how to METAL!! Sh*tty drum sound (only that forced-to-be-heavy-sound of double bass drums)!! NO SOLOS!! (ok, guitar is the major role and the representitive of Metal...without a guitar solo, it's a sh*t.) too old voice of James, etc etc etc....ok Metallica, LEAVE OR DIE BEFORE U GIVE US MORE SH*ITTINESS"
1,Truly sad,"Metallica jumped the shark with ""Load"" (arguably, even earlier, with the ""Black Album"", depending on one's tastes), and have gotten progressively worse with each subsequent release, but there's just no excuse for this sonic nightmare: ""St. Anger"" may well be the worst sounding CD ever released by a major act. Boring songs, hideous production, and (sorry, Lars) flat-out awful drumming. Oh, and virtually no lead guitar either.Metallica's first four releases (""Kill 'Em All"", ""Ride The Lightning"", ""Master Of Puppets"", ""...And Justice For All"") are absolutely essential listening for even a casual fan of Heavy Metal. This is a must to avoid for anyone with ears."
3,Good have been great,"I am 13. I also am a die-hard Metallica fan, so it's really hard to say that this CD isn't awsome, cause all the others are except Load. It has some good songs, but it also has some songs that had the potential to be great. Like at the beginning of St. Anger, the drums totally drown out the guitars. The bass is almost nonexistent, andsome songs go for way to long. And the abridged version of Some kind of Monster on the CD Some Kind of Monster is much better, cuz this one is twice as long and just repeats the whole time. And why the explicit lyrics label? There were probably 6-7 swears on the whole CD! My dad has a CD with a song that has about 25 swears in that song, and it doesn't have one."
2,"What happened, Metallica?","This album is probably one of the largest dissapointments I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Every album before this one deserves 4 or 5 stars, and it doesn't take a genius to see that. So what the hell happened? I wish I knew, but sadly I don't. ""St. Anger"" is okay I suppose, but compared to other Metallica albums, its complete garbage. What else can I say? If you are a Metallica fan, avoid this album like the plaigue."
1,I have tried again and again to like this CD - But it stinks,"With better production this CD might be listenable. Some music parts are pretty good. Most of the lyrics are pitiful. The worst part of it all though is the sound. If I'm listening to a internet radio station at work and listening to bands like Slayer, At the Gates, etc.. I will just work away and enjoy. Then a St Anger song will come on and I have to stop working and shake my head for a few seconds. It just sounds so bad it's un real. Even old Minor Threat and Dead Kennedy's Cd's have better production than St Anger. This CD will have to be put to rest in my collection. It just isn't worth listening to that horrible sound to try and enjoy the songs. For any one interested in great metal pick up the Opeth DVD that was just released. It is incredible, and the songs sound ten times better live than they do on their CD's."
1,What type of Rock Band is greedy enough to sue its own fans?,METALLICA the Band that once was. The once in your face and f off attitude is now gone replaced buy a bunch of corporate rock greedy ass kissing old men. The as the ultmate insult Metallica sues its fans for downloading and swaping their music. What a slap in the face to their all their fans. How greedy does a band have to be-i guess after the crap they have been putting out latley including this pathetic album sums it all up. And after what they did to their fans is simply UNFORGIVABLE. Do not waste your money time or energy to support this pathetic band instead let them just FADE to Black and put them where their music now deserves to be in the 99cent cut out bin. Metallica may your fans all desert you so that you all can go roast in hell---you bunch of sell outs!!!!! im glad that Cliff (god rest his soul) aint around to see what happened to his band.
1,What did you expect?,"What did you expect from a band that did not yet have a real replacement bass player for Jason Newstead, had a full time psycho therapist in the studio with them, and experienced writing and recording delays by Hetfield's lengthy detox and subsequent touchy feely healing process? Of course it was gonna suck!"
2,Just one minor comment,"Why oh why couldn't they have turned up Lar's snare just a little louder in the mix? You know; so instead of sounding like a retard caning a welding tank it would sound like A-Rod going to town on a propane tank with an aluminum baseball bat.Yeah. That'd be great. I mean, if you're going to be ridiculous, why not go all the way, right?"
2,guitar solos ?,"yes it's Metallica; yes it's a big sound; BUT where are the Kirk Hammett guitar's solos ? there are NO guitar's solos on this album !!, and Metallica without solos is NOT Metallica; i'm disappointed, very ! bad album isn't it."
2,dont know what to think,"i dont know what to thinkfirst the album is so [bad]! the music there isnt so good , example is st anger ( song no.2) , they create a nu-metal kind, fast and without any soul.this is not metallica that i know.but from other way that kind remind me the old metallica.anyway , this cd is just for statistics that fans have for saying i have the new cd of metallica, like load and reload."
1,St. [Stuff],This is the worst cd I have ever heard. What a huge let down. I just can not belive that thay whould have put there name on this. I have been a fan of everything thay have ever made. It sounds like thay jut didnt put there hearts into it like thay have in the past. There is no reason to get this cd.
5,Back to oldies,"st anger, at is sound, pure rage going through this guitars, a good resume will be that metallica went to the savage of begining. no more polite music for people, only true feelings ..."
1,More Balladra!!!! Blah blah blah,"The DEATH of this band goes back to a key player - BOB ROCK!! Can't blame him solely though for these folks put him in the position he's in!!! Regardless, this things lacking ALL the things true fans (from the beginning) were hoping for! Kirk - LEAVE the band NOW! Obviously someone thinks you have lost the ability to play lead... (was it YOU?) Larz.. spend some cash - buy some DRUMS - or go join the Blue Man Group! Rob - throw some Suicidal Respect back into these cats before it's too late!"
1,METALLICLOWNS,"They used to be metal heroes... but now they are the BOZOS of metal.Let's be honest st anger is a joke, a bad one.SHOOT ALL THE CLOWNS!"
4,Grows on You,"Being a long-time fan of Metallica, we have all of their albums (CDS) but when I first heard this new album, I thought it SUCKED...but after you listen to it for a little bit, it will grow on you just like the other (Load & Reload) albums. The songs have potential. The bonus DVD rocks also!"
3,a really bad change,"I have done many reviews in the past day, not because I just discovered metallica, but because I just thought that people should know about their music.But none like this.This has got to be one of metallicas worst cds/albums.Its not horrible,its not good either, its just not what pretty much any metallica fans are looking for.James decided to change his style of music[again]This is the only change that really put them downhill.They decided to change their music to ''angry'' crap.If cliff burton could hear them, he would be turning in his grave.The guitar,bass,and drums are OK.But James just doesnt have the same lyrics and voice to back it all up.[ Its a shame cause i'm a huge metallica fan]"
3,better than reload,"if your a metallica fan from the old school, before load and reload and the black album this is right up your street. it's hard, loud and fast, in fact its ride the lightning without guitar solo's. to many fans kirk hammets amazing guitar playing is what is missing from this album, but like korn's version of one, it's certainly different. although its not the best album the combination of loud and quiet make it a mid way album, the track shoot me again is one of my favorites here and while not as great as say fight fire with fire it's still among the top 10 metallica tracks ever."
1,So disappointing...,"For as long as it's been since the last album, you would think this album would just blow you over. It doesn't even come close. I love Metallica, old and new, but this album is just a blistering mess. First of all, I think the hearing loss must be getting to the guys because this album is mixed horribly. The drums sound like Lars recorded them while playing in a tin can, and the guitars are so muddy and indistinct that you can discern what the hell is going on. The lyrics are horrendous, and all the songs are unbelievably repetetive. Yeah, they're all 10 minutes long, but after 3, you've heard everything, and it just repeats, and repeats, and repeats. I guess the truly die hard fans might love this new sound, but I couldn't be more disappointed. There are no epics, no great songs like Metallica of old, nor anything catchy or intricate like their newer stuff. This is just garbage....beware."
1,Another Dissapointing Metallica Release,"I am amazed how these guy's can keep dissapointing me. The Black Album was a shock at first but about five songs off of the CD grew on me. Load was a total let down but two or three songs I finally found to be decent. Re Load left me with about one song I liked. Now St Anger has given me not a song I can listen to and enjoy. I still crank Ride the Lightning, Master Of Puppets, and Justice from time to time. Those CD's are truly great CD's. From beginning to end they are solid CD's. The latest four releases are full of filler songs. A catchy riff here and good chorus there but all in all the CD's are weak and unimpressive. I'm very let down by Metallica. They are just getting worse and worse. Each release since Justice for all... is progressivley boring and lame. Is the next CD going to sound like Blink 182 ?"
4,Yikes!!!,"Boy, some people hate this album! I don't. It's not the best Metallica stuff, but I like the band and I've liked them in everything they've done, even the sometimes-trashed S+M album. I admit Metallica sounds different, but they pull it off. Give this one a try.You may be plesently surprised. I was."
1,Worst yet.,"I have been a Metallica fan since first hearing the song ""One"". I am highly dissappointed in this effort. I regret to say that St. Anger is a very alien sounding, and poorly produced album. I think Metallica has reached the twilight of their ability to write new, good music. Listen and decide for yourself, dont take my word for it."
2,Booooooo!,i think all the good soundingness went away with newsted. it sounds like it was recorded in a garage. they need to hang it up. metallica's head is already big enough. still people will buy this [not so good] cd and llove it because it is metallica.
3,"""AN ACTUAL REVIEW""","Yes, it is not the best and there are no solos but it ain't all that bad. Here are the ratings for the songs.1-Frantic-(5:50)- 10/102-St.Anger-(7:21)- 10/103-Some Kind of Monster-(8:25)- 7/104-Dirty Window-(5:24)- 9/105-Invisible Kid-(8:30)- 8/106-My World-(5:45)- 10/107-Shoot Me Again-(7:10)- 8/108-Sweet Amber-(5:27)- 8/109-The Unamed Feeling-(7:08)- 7/1010-Purify-(5:13)- 9/1011-All Within My Hands-(8:48)- 7/10TOTAL-93/110- 85%It also icludes a dvd with the whole album played out in a studio. It's actually pretty good. A little better then the album."
2,Metallica or Not?,"Before I even continue, I think one thing should be cleared up first. Rob Trujillo did not play on this album. The majority of this recording was complete before he was officially made a member of the band. Bob Rock (record producer) did the bass for this album.Now....I'm a fan of the older material and I also play the older material so I can say that this album is far from being back to old school. Lars sounds horrible on the drums (maybe it was just the horrible production) and Kirk does not solo. This album sounds more like Linkin Park and Lim Biskit (bands I loathe) than Metallica.With that in mind, I'm glad I only borrowed the cd from a friend and didn't buy it myself. You want bands that stick to their metal roots and don't try to be something they're not, then I recommend the following:Iced EarthBlind GuardianHammerfallSymphony XDream TheaterIron Maiden"
1,Uhg... What happened??!!,"Metallica is one of my favorite bands but this album is just terrible. The music doesn't take any risks and the lyrics seem like they were put in at the last minute because they are not very thoughtful and repetitive. There is so much for a band like this to say right now and instead they went the route of following most other the metal bands out today, which is down the crap hole. The riffs are unoriginal as well. I think its great if a band goes through changes but I really feel like this band is regressing. If people disagree, first go back and listen to the song Disposable Heroes, a phenomenal antiwar song that is valid today, or how about Master of Puppets, lyrically and musically both these songs are genious. There is no comparison between the old and new Metallica."
4,St. Anger,"St. Anger is definatly not the best of Metallica's work, that goes to either ...And Justice or Master of Puppets. When I first listened to the cd I was somewhat dissapointed, but after I listened to it a few more times I slowly began to like the songs. The cd is pretty well rounded I found, none of the songs really stick out as being marginally better than the others. The song i dislike the most out of the cd has to be St. Anger though, its just too repetitive for my tastes. But anyways, i would definatly recommend to buy this cd, you may not like it at first, but it eventually grows on you."
5,Metallica...Heavy and Frantic,"Ok, let me start by saying that this cd has gotten some bad reviews. I think that this cd should get alote more credit, this cd shows that Metallica can go back to the more heavier side. ""Load"" and ""Reload"" are very good albums but are not as raw and hard as ""St.Anger. Even though solos are not in any of the tracks dont let that foul you..this is NOT nu-metal, not even close. If you like raw, gritty sounding and heavy, you will love this album. Some of the best tracks on the cd are ""Frantic"" ""St. Anger"" ""Dirty Window"" and ""All Within My Hands"" dont let some of the things said about this album give you doubts. If you are a big fan of Metallica,like myself, or just discovering them get this cd along with Master of Puppets its freakin great!"
1,Great Album?,"This is a wonderful CD! The disk itself makes a great coaster for my beer and/or coffee! My dog loves to play catch with the bonus frisbee that Electra Records included for free (oh, wait...you mean that was the DVD?!?) AND...I fixed an uneven table leg with the CD case! Pretty useful item for under $20!!!But in all seriousness, if an unsigned band were to have written this material and submitted it to a label with hopes of getting signed, I'm pretty sure the A+R Dept. would've gotten a good laugh out of it... at best! It's really THAT bad. Metallica is dead....but that's O.K. If the members would simply realize that fact and pursue other areas of musical interest, we'd probably get some pretty good material. Hetfield always has been a great songwriter... and in the future, I think he'll surprise us again...although it probably won't be metal."
2,contracted?,"More or less everything has already been said about this CD.I just feel that if an unknown band had approached a record company with this CD as a demo wanting to obtain a record contract, they would have been unsuccessful in obtaining one."
1,So Spinal Tap,"The album is a dreadful and unforgivable mess. Anyone who disagrees is 100% in denial. Go ahead and drink Lars Ulrich's warm, yellow Kool-Aid because ""St. Anger"" is a disaster. Put on the old stuff and pretend this never happened. Oh, and I just read that they're working with Rick Rubin on the next one. Good luck, boys! It is OVER and has been for quite some time. Just sad."
1,heh holy crap,"I was never a huge metallica fan to start with. There's a few songs I enjoy, like 50 years ago when they were my age. But magooosh, this album is the worst thing I've ever heard. They must be trying to suck, and the suceeded wonderfully."
1,Not even worthy of one star,"This CD is unlistenable. I bought this with a positive attitude, but once I heard the drums, I pretty much needed to get kleenex for my ears because they started to bleed. I mean...there's bad music, and there's music that is painful to listen to. This is the latter. People can say ""well there are some cool parts"" to this CD all they want, but when it's buried in 75 minutes of pure cacophony noise, I want no part in it.I can't believe producers can even give this CD a green light, much less the band. Everyone knows this CD is one of the worst listens ever made, but I just had to give my opinion too. Metallica used to be one of those bands that I would ALWAYS buy their new stuff, because I had so much faith in them...not anymore. I'm staying far far away from this and all other releases. In fact, their old stuff is so overplayed, I don't even listen to that anymore either. So Metallica is basically a has been."
3,"Not their best, but not completely bad . . .","If some of you read the interviews . . .the band and the producer purposely mastered the album to sound the way it did. That is what they wanted, so that is what they did. They don't care about what you think!"
3,where are the solos,"some good songs ,nice riffs ,kirk where the solos man.Just a taste of what's to come I guess!So far Frantic and St. Anger are the best tracks I think."
1,Quite possibly the worst CD of the year.,This CD is absolutely terrible. It is unlike anything Metallica has ever released. Back to their roots? Give me a break. Read the other reviews. It really does sound like Lars is pounding on buckets and garbage cans. James really does sound like a dying cat. The lyrics are stupid and repetitive. I still haven't figured out what Kirk was doing while they were recording. . . he sure wasn't playing any solos. In addition to all of this they intentionally reduced the quality of the recording. Even on a decent stereo it sounds like a mono recording played over AM radio. Do not buy this CD.
1,Its Roy's Fault !!!,"I am the biggest Metallica fan EVER! I have been to every show since the first one they ever did.Metallica- lets kill em allMetallica- do everyone a favor and ride the lightningBob Rock is Master of puppetsMetallica-Wheres the justice? this is a felony !!Metallica- Load,Reload....LOAD OF S#!+Why ???Hitler killed jews. OKMichael Jaskson molests kids. we'll let it slipThe twin towers are gone. Whats done is done,My wife is cheating on me. S*** happensMetallicA writes S*** like THIS !!! Forgive them Father for they know not what they do.My life is metallica, metallica is over, so is my life.Thanks a lot Metallica.GOOD DAY"
1,worst metallica album ever!,"this album is the worst.....sounds like lars is playing the bongos in the back ground in every song. If they go back to the old style like they did in this cd, where is kirks solo? what a blow to metallica with this cd, only song worth listening to is st.anger and the bongo sound in lars drums just drive you crazy though this entire cd."
1,Why!?!?,"Ok, I would like to start out by saying that until the fifth of June I was an advocate of Metallica. St. Anger was not Metallica, and frankly made my respect for the band diminish greatly. I still have much respect for the band, but this album was wretched. If any of the band members read this I would like to say,""Everything from Black to Re-load was what made Metallica different from Megadeth and any other trash metal band. Please go back to the studio and redeem yourselves."""
2,What happened to the guitar solos???,"Horrible lyrics...No guitar solos???...Rapping? What happened to Metallica? I'm not expecting the old Metallica but at least they should write some decent music. The vocals sound terrible! And what the hell is Lars using as a snare? an empty can?? The album is long and extremely boring...I much rather listen to LOAD or the RELOAD than this album...I really feel so disappointed with St Anger...For all those people that say that this is a great album, let me see them a week from now if they are still listening to it."
1,Disappointment!!!!,"I'm not even a hardcore follower like some of the longtimers but this is just a terrible album! Very disappointing! I think there is only one, maybe two songs that I would listen to more than ONCE! The ""black"" album which is my favorite & not even considered their ""best"" by aficionados puts this garbage to shame. Metallica should be embarassed!"
3,its not bad,"it is okay there some good songs frantic,st anger,puirfy,unamed feeling,invisble kidlet me say at least its hear not this crappy load re-load crap it go a little bit of metal in it so buy if u wana"
4,"Its good, but is it Metallica?","I like this album a lot. Its hard and fast. Much crunchier than they have been before and the speed on some songs is similar to the old days. The songs are crafted to blow you away, unfortunatly James' vocals are too weak on most of the songs. It just doesn't fit. In some respects it is a cross between Pantera and Corrosion of Conformity, musically. This is what makes this album! If you expect old Metallica well you should have realized after that horrible Reload album that they will never make that same kind of music again. So pretend its not Metallica and enjoy."
2,"nice try, horrible outcome","I am a longtime fan, and respect that Metallica was trying to do: go for a raw, emotional, hard album that has a garage feel to it. But they made the mistake of recording this album in a fashion that makes it sound like they stuck one microphone in the middle of a room and just played. I think Bob Rock spent too much time playing bass on this album and too little paying attention to producing and watching out for the quality as he usually does. Eveyone I know has wished they had not bought this CD. I have tried to let it grow on me, but at the end of the day, there is not a song on there that really pulls me back in. too bad, I really was looking forward to this. They still were great in concert though."
1,The Worst Album of the Century....,"damn, id rather listen to lindsay lohan, ashlee simpson, or the new backstreet boys album than this crap. and thats saying alot, trust me. every single song on here is god awful. i wouldnt even wish this kind of music listeing on my worst enemy. everything about this album is poor. the production, mixing, instruments, vocals, etc. everything!! i cant even imagine how the metallica we all know and love who gave us the 1991 album with all their classics, enter sandman, master of puppets, nothing else matters, etc thought to put this out. how? how? . how did they go from that masterpiece to this trashpiece. this album will be remembered alright. it will be remembered as the biggest atrocity to the metal if not music world."
2,Is Bob Rock Deaf?,"Wow, what happened to the previously awesome Bob Rock/Metallica production/mix style? It sounds like the album was sent to some home project studio and mixed down onto a cassette four track. I don't know if this is an attempt to sound ""fresh"" and ""raw"", but I would just say ""bad"". The songs are pretty good, overall. In fact, ""Frantic"" and ""St. Anger"" stand out as classics. Tracks such as ""Some Kind Of Monster"", ""Purify"", ""Dirty Window"" and ""Sweet Amber"" are also some of the better tracks. But songs like ""Invisible Kid"" and ""Shoot Me Again"" seem overlong and drag the album down a bit. Sonically, the album is a big disappointment to me, though. I am left longing for the tight, lean production of their past efforts with Rock, rather than this muddy, sloppy mess of a mix."
2,I might like it but...,"As a fan since ""Ride"" and ""Master"" I might like it but....-The snare drum is ANNOYING! Was the snare micd/set-up differently? If you doubt my observation check this recording against any of the others in Met's catalog.-There is little sonic difference/definition of any guitar (lead, rythm, bass). Was the recording tested anywhere outside the studio walls before final mix down? And yes I **know** these guys have awesome chops ""hiding"" in there somewhere!- The vocal style is certainly not up to the level of prior recordings. Maybe James was sick?Save your $$$!!!!"
2,Metallica-fits,"I'm a longtime fan - I bought ""kill 'em all"" when it came out, saw them play in small clubs around NYC / LI touring for the first two efforts, and saw them at big arena shows as time went on. My favs are 1)Ride the lightening, 2)Kill 'em all, 3)Master of puppets, 4)Gargage days revisited - the 9.98 CD, 5)Black CD, 6)...And justice for all.I wasn't crazy about ""Load"" and ""Re-load"", and even ""Justice"" is a bit tired. That said, the 8 minute long songs are not my thing at all with this band.The new CD seems to have taken the tempo and angst of the early work and combined it with the drawn out length of the more recent CDs, with the poor production quality of the ""Garage days"" EPs. Metallica always used to say how much Diamond Head and The Misfits influenced their sound - and here it sounds very much like ""Earth A.D."" era Misfits, only with the songs being way too long. I don't hate this CD, but I can't stop thinking that it just sounds unfinished when I listen to it."
1,Best Comedy Album of the Year,"After listening to this, Load and Reload don't seem that bad. It sounds like they all took stupid pills when they made this album. I will give it this though, every time I hear James go &quot;Flush it out&quot; in St. Anger, I laugh. I really do, it's just so rediculously funny to me. So, as a metal album, this is terrible, but as a comedy album, it gets my vote for the grammy!"
4,great!!!,"Great CD, yes, very different sound for Metallica, but still thing, it reaches back to what they started from, what they're all about. Spitting in the face of the ""new, hip, cool"" music. Perhaps if they realease another cd within the next couple of years, that it'll show more meaning as to what their new sound is all about. I personally love it. Everyone should give it more of a chance."
2,its not THAT bad!,"I think a lot of these reviews on here are a bit over the top and ill-considered, from people who unless Metallica go back to their 80s sound will never be happy. I'd just like to say there are about 3 good songs on the record. If the whole record was up to the standard of 'frantic' it would be a wicked album but since the rest of the songs are mediocre it isn't. I acknowledge 80s Metallica was ten times better than this but i think giving this album 1 star and calling it the worst album of all time is a bit exaggerated. And the production isn't bad, other people who listen to bands like Kyuss will agree with me on this, its just most of the songs don't have good riffs or lyrics basically, but its just mediocre, not ""terrible."""
1,Metallica is dead,"Upon listening to this cd, it is obvious that metallica has changed. This is by far their worst album, just about everything sucks. The drums sound horrible, the lyrics are annoying, and most of all where did the guitar solos go?!! I thougth that was what metallica was all about? Anyways if you really want to get back at metallica for releasing this garbage, go pick up megadeths new cd ""the system has failed"". Metallica should of stuck with Dave Mustaine, he knows what hes doing. St. Anger for me was the offical deth of metallica"
2,WOW!,"I couldn't even begin to say how much I am dissapointed by this album. All that MTV hype was just to get sales up for this worthless album. There is not one Kirk Hammet solo on the entire CD, the lyrics are uninspired. The only reason I gave this album more than one star is because Lars is laying it down on this album. I watched the DVD and saw that new bassist and he just is not metallica material. He seems as if he is more of a fan than actually in the band."
4,Why all the negative energy?,"I dunno, compared with the mid-1990s fiascoes that were Load & Re-Load, and the mediocre pop-metal Black Album, this album is excellent. Definitely their best work since Justice - Raw, lots of speed and energy.I know most Metallica fans do not share this sentiment, but when this thing first came out in '03 I was ecstatic cos it had been 15 years since they actually released an album that was not weak at heart...Best songs are Frantic, St Anger, Invisible Kid, Sweet Amber, That Unnamed Feeling, Purify and All Within My Hands.The bonus live rehearsal DVD is also quality - probably better than the album itself. It's certainly better than their other official 'live' release S&M; which was absolute garbage musically. Watching the St Anger songs live in the rehearsal studio presents them in the way they were meant to be heard - live.I think this record is better than most folks give credit...."
4,Could be better if sound quality wasn't so bad,"Does anyone else feel that this could have been a great album if the sound quality wasn't so awful? There are a lot of great hooks and riffs but you can never tell because when you try to listen to the music it sounds like it's being played through a crummy mono tape deck from the eighties. At first I thought my ears were clogged. But if you listen closely the songs are really good. It's a frustrating album because the music is good and I want to hear it but the sound and the way it was recorded really sucks. I really want to like this album but the sound quality makes me turn it off. I have been listening to Metallica since I was thirteen years old in 1986. I have listened to them get better and then worse and then awesome with Death Magnetic, my favorite Metallica album. I wish they'd remix and remaster this album!"
2,Not bad for a demo,"This album is pretty good for something recorded on 4 tracks in a basement. The actual studio release should be something to look forward to.St. Anger is a demo, isn't it?"
1,HARVESTER OF GARBAGE,"After being a hard core metallica fan for the longest time i can say i'm done with metallica now. St.Anger is the most disusting thing i've ever heard in my life. I'D RATHER LISTEN TO JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE TAKING A SH*T THAN ST.ANGER.If you like anything about this album you have some serious mental issues.I do like the black album and the load stuff. But after this piece of crap and them hanging out on MTV and touring with filth like limp bizkit,I just don't have the respect for them that i used to.I'd really like to see them rebound from this but i doubt it.If you guys want real metal to litsen to i suggest Black sabbath ."
3,So we waited six years for this?,"From all I've been hearing this is the album that will please the old school metal fans. After one listen, I don't know what to say ... On the positive side, there're a lot of cool riffs on this album. The early 80's aggression made a welcoming return. However, is Kirk Hammett even on this??? I have always been a big fan of Kirk. I appreciate his impossibly diverse taste - everything from Michael Schenker to Carlos Santana to Stevie Ray Vaughan to John Coltrane. I've been dying to hear him to incorporate all his influences into killer solos. I must say I was disappointed once again! Also, the drum sound is too weird for me. I've never heard anything like it. For all of you still longing for ""... And Justice For All"", go pick up anything by Iced Earth, or check out the whole European power metal scene."
2,Ill not be easy,"I.v been a Metallica fan since Ride the Lightning, and this is by far the worst Metallica recording I,v ever heard. The entire album sounds like it was recorded inside of a tin can. The vocals are faint, the music itself is muddy and rushed. I got not more than four tracks into the CD when I wanted to return it to the store and get my money back. Sounds like theyve been listening to too much System of a Down.(which to me was another disappointment along with the latest Godsmack)But I digress. I have not talked to one single person who tinks this album is anything but a peice of ... . Try again guys. Do it yurself and let Bob Rock go back to Bon Jovi. This album [is not good]!"
1,What has happened to Metallica ??,"This is perhaps the biggest letdown of the Summer. To begin, while Metallica may not be the most talented of the heavy metal bands, we have always relied on them for new and exciting mateerial, or at least material that has some form of substance and perhaps a little continuity. However, with this most recent attempt at music, all those who claimed the band ""sold out"" when Load was released must now reevaluate their position. If they sold out then, what have they done now?? Is there a step beyond selling out?? Shouldn't bands be required to change their name before such a complete departure from all things musical. That being said I'm sure they will sell an enourmous number of albums because unlike previous Metallica works this sounds exactly like everything else on the radio. Perhaps they should change their name to Puddle of Metalicpool."
2,Who are these impostors?,"Sounds more like Queens of the Stone Age than Metallica! What happened to Kirk's soaring, intricate melodies and the head banging thrash?!? Instead, we've got down tuned guitars and stoner rock song structures! There's not a single memorable song throughout this CD!Major letdown..."
1,Oh G-d; what is this garbage?!,"I had prepared myself for a pretty bad release, but nothing could have prepared me for what I had to suffer through while listening to this trash (not to be confused with trash-metal), I had to look twice to reassure myself that I had bought the correct album as the cover art is a complete rip off of KMFDM! By God, save your money, don't make a mistake. Looks like Metallica is not doing this album for the fans, but for the quick buck. No more a Metallica fan!"
5,They're Back!,"Now that's more like it! Metallica has taken us back to their beginnings.... well, you know, sorta. At least as far back as they want to take us. Gotta love the new album. Still intense and deep. RUSH SigEp!"
2,Old Metallica,"People who loved the old thrash Metallica (pre Black album) will absolutely love St.Anger. The music is a pounding auditory assault.Fans of the more recent Metallica efforts (post Black album) will probably not enjoy it. There are no power ballads, guitar solos, or tightly arraigned metal songs. It is pure thrash metal.Since I am in the latter camp I find this CD disappointing. I feel that the &#65533;Black&#65533; album, Load, and Reload are some of the best metal CDs ever produced. They showcase a musically mature Metallica playing and writing at their best. To me St. Anger offers nothing.I hope the next album sounds better."
1,Are u a real fan?,"ok, have to say this album really ..., just cant hear anymore of it, its a long anoying 75 min long song BUT if we are real fans of Metallica we have to support them on the bad and good days dont we?, this album was a complet mistake from the production to the release , but real fans will support Metallica always, cause on albums like : Master of puppets , Kill em all, Black album and Ride the lighting, they brought excelent music to us.Dont buy this album, buy the old ones. This really ... ."
1,hetfield get a grip,dissapointed to say the least.Metallica along with maiden are probably the only two genuinly good metal bands....but after todays hearing of their latest disc I must say its only maiden now....what ticks me off is that its NEW METAL.and that is'nt something you expect from a legendary band like metallica...they have degraded themselves to linkin park....what happened to the all inspired song writing style of load and reload and the black album?...Please hetfield GET A GRIP!!!!!
2,Poor attempt at a comeback...,"Hey, we've all been waiting fot this, right? So we are all gonna go get it of course. Well for those of you who haven't yet, save your money. The first five songs are actually quite good, especially Invisble Kid. But after that, it is a pitiful album, with the exlcusion of certain parts of Sweet Amber. The rest is pitful. No solos, terrible riffs, bad singing, bad snare. And what's with the nu-metal? ..."
1,Should Change their name to Nu-Metallica,"Really bad music. If you like Korn, Staind and other bad Nu-Metal you will like this. Real Metal fans do not waste your time."
2,Not your father's Metallica or your big brothers....,"This is a different kind of Metallica.There isn't a whole lot going on with this album. Doesn't sound like anything they've done before.I'm sad to say that the best songs are mediocre at best (Purify & Frantic).Maybe Metallica is hoping for a new fan base on this one, because it ain't my Metallica. At least Load & Re-Load sorta sounded like Metallica.Jason Newsted is probably cracking open a beer and lightin' one up and laughing his [*] off being relieved with the knowledge that he made the right decision.Recommend not buying it. I'm gonna see what I can do about returning my copy, just too painful."
2,what happened to the old metallica?,"I didn't buy this one on the web. I bought it at the record store near my house. But anyways, I think that Metallica has drifted to far from the sound that so many people loved. This new album has a new sound similar to that of Finger Eleven or Slipknot. And to boot, all of us are familiar with a guitar solo in every song? Not the case on this one. Sorry boys, but this isn't the one we were ready for."
3,sad but true,"This is by far Metallica's heaviest album,it is strong and deep but lacking the basic Metallica fundamentals ie. where the hell are the bleeding guitar solos and what is up with Hetfield's voice. Lar's sounds like he got a new drum kit for christmas but forget how to play in a band.Metallica used to be innovators of metal but in this they seem to be content to put out the same [stuff] as ""slipknot"" and ""limp bizkit"".Sad but true Metallica have entered the sandman and forgot where they came from,probably letting Bob Rock influence to much."
5,What An Album!!,"I almost wonder if I've really listened to the new Metallica album St Anger, or if somebody has been playing a trick on me and played me some new, exciting aggro-band. You see, St. Anger is a chock, one of music history's greatest! It is as if Load and Reload has been deleted from the map, as if the Black Album never existed, as if the Metallica we've come to know never really existed. The St Anger CD exhibits a sound so EXTREME and raw that all you can do is sit there chocked with your jaw on the floor"
4,Don't expect the Metallica of 6 years ago!,"I've been a Metallica fan since the beginning. Since the whole Napster fiasco with Lars, I turned my back on them until St. Anger. I figured I'd give them another shot. Don't expect to hear the Metallica you're used to. Get ready for Lars playing with the snares off the snare drum. Don't expect too many ripping leads from Kirk and James doesn't have the same punch in his vocal delivery that he used to, although his power chords are well delivered. I gave St. Anger four stars for two reasons. One, I think Metallica reinvented themselves and have a whole new sound that's NOT wimpy. Two, When you buy the CD, you also get a DVD with footage of the band sans Jason, playing all of the songs on the CD in the rehersal studio. Now that's cool. In addition, you also get a code number to get into the Metallica music vault on the net. In conclusion, I would recommend this CD but just don't expect the changes we had when the CD Metallica came out Rock on!"
1,st bullchit,"just when i thought it coudln't get any worse, they put out this garbage. load and reload sucked ass, but this is the epitome of the word crap. it's time to pack it in and retire. PLEASE."
1,A Grim day for Metallica fans....,"The fact that over a 1000 people gave this sorry excuse for music is shocking to me.I guess they never really listened to this album nor seem ""Some kind of Monster"". Or the fact the James Hetfield has said that making this album and that ""movie"" was a mistake. It is quite clear that people no longer listen to good music let alone know what good music is. Its these people that say Eminem is a great rapper or Linkin Park is a wonderful band. Wake up people!!Music is not the same as it was 20 years ago."
2,Review of St. Anger,"I expected this album to be harder. It just doesn't have the same inpact on me as the previous albums had. This time I didn't enjoy in 11 minute songs because they're, lets be sincere, boring. I hope next time they'll do something better."
1,Worst Rock Album EVER,"This album is horrible. I wish I could give it ZERO stars.Horrible vocals, Horrible drums, Horrible guitar - no solos????What happened to Metallica??????"
1,"One star is too nice, it should be zero.","HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! All I can do is laugh. This blows, this blows, THIS BLOWS!!! Terrible album, terrible band, terrible everything. Ever since Metallica became more concerned with stopping Napster and making a few more dollars, their music has plunged to rock bottom. Actually, the last good album they made was the Black Album. So, it has now been a full 12 years since anything good has come from Metallica, and yet they are still around. It reminds me of Emmit Smith. He could have gone out on top of the world, but he changed teams, changed styles, and is now making an ass of himself and just making everyone around him cringe. Sounds kinda like Lars and the boys, huh? THIS ALBUM SUCKS, METALLICA HAS SUCKED FOR 12 YEARS, AND F*CK LARS FOR BOOTING ME OFF NAPSTER BACK IN 2000. (Yes, I was one of the chosen few on the list sent to napster, I went to court and got reinstated, though. No lie.) I'm out."
1,The really blew it!,"I don't know why they made such a drastic change in their music, it's like they just wanted to start all over again and forget their roots. WHY?! I'm no huge Metallica fan but some oldies of theirs were unbelievable (In a good way!). This is no where near half good of their classic ones. Seriously, DO NOT get this!"
1,so who ever said this album was a return to form,"to all those metallica [rear]kissing fans who said the band will do what they like and that's why they evolved, why did they take a 180 degree turn and come up with a ""metal"" record? anyway the new one is a very bland, uninspiring, and awful record. drum sound is bad (did lars use a tin can?), singing is really bad, and the lack of solos is another black mark. solos are not essential to a song, but it really gives an aesthetic value to the song but then the songs are so bad no solo would have saved them. ..."
3,Aggravating,"Save your money and buy the Garmin Nuvi 350. MSST 2007 has managed to let me dwon, again. or rather it is MS. My BIGGEST complaint among many (and I will spare everyone)is the inability to take my planning as I set it up in route planning. It overrides my coices I add and reroutes me. VERY aggravating as the direction they give me is NOT the correct way! Another complaint is why should everyone have to buy a new version EVERY year. We should have the ability for a small fee to obtain updates, product maintenance and ACCURATE directions. My neighborhood isn't even on the map yet and we have been here 3 years!"
3,Nothing Much New in Functionality,"As one who upgraded from MS Streets and Trips 2002, I expected to see more functionality. Like 2002 it was also usable on PDA/Cell phone devices. Microsoft drives to you upgrade the product because they stop all support of the earlier versions, which means the database gets out of date. However, if you have never used this product it is the best of its kind. MS Streets and Trips is compatible with several GPS transponders. In my case not a factor in my business yet."
5,Barbaric Wonder,"Basil Poledouris' score for CONAN THE BARBARIAN is one of those rare gems--a soundtrack that is far superior to the motion picture it was intended to support. Leading in with a brass and drum theme backed with strings (""Anvil of Crom""), CONAN evokes just the right mood if you're looking for it: savage action, nobility, and even (dare I say it) ethereal beauty. Other notable cues are ""Riders of Doom"" and the lovely ""Wifeing,"" wherein Conan and Valeria get better acquainted...in between swordplay, of course.Poledouris also scored the films RED DAWN and THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER; both scores feature some substantial essence not commonly found in movie soundtracks. Buy them all if you can find them!"
5,Conan the Barbarian,I enjoyed this movie now as did when I was a very young girl. It is a nice fairy tale and it was a begining of a great career for Arnold as well. I am very glad that I bought it. I enjoyed just the simple acting and not all the fancy special effects of movies today that are so far over the top that it cost in the millions to make a movie today.
1,Great Read. Bad Visual Addition,"This is a great spiritual classic, but I suggest buying a different version because this one has a lot of abrupt line breaks that are distracting."
3,Tough going.,"Translator has made this poetry into pretty dry stuff, I'm going to try the Spanish version."
2,Ick,Usually the books I read have several under-lined passages in them when I'm done- This book....not one! I'm donating it to Good-Will
4,Nice Drill - But had initial problems once received,"Hi, I purchased this as a gift for my husband directly from Amazon.com. I chose the reconditioned because it offered the same warranty as the new one and was about $30 less in price. However, upon receiving it, the stud finder accessory on the drill didnt work - it did nothing at all. I had to make several phone calls to Skil before I was able to get a replacement for it. They initially wanted it to be returned (me to pay shipping on it + on the new one) for something that was less than 24 hours old and never used. After speaking with several people there, I was finally able to get a replacement at no cost - but took a lot of hassle for such a small accessory that should have worked from day one. Had I purchased at an actual retail store, I could have just returned it there - I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Definitive Shin Seiki Evangelion,"There is no other way to describe this sound track except fantastic. It's almost worth it just to hear the extended version of the show's theme song, ""Zankoku na Tenshi no Te-ze"" (it's a shame they had to shorten it for TV...I'd have sat through it). Even ""Fly Me To The Moon"", which I never listened to during the show's ending credits, grew on me very quickly. I set my CD player to wake me up in the morning with ""Misato's Theme"", and I can almost imagine Pen-Pen sitting there sucking down a fish.The only thing keeping this review from being five-stars is the price (dang imports) and the fact that some of the instrumentals are a liiiiiittle boring. I prefer the more upbeat, action tracks (""EVA-02"", ""The Beast"") to the introspective ones (""Rei I"", ""I. Shinji""). Still, you can't call yourself an Eva freak unless you own this.Then again, you may not WANT to call yourself an Eva freak...so then why are you reading this? Go to work or something!"
5,Students love to read.,I ordered a series of these books. Students love the biographies of their favorite athletes. I would recommend purchasing these books for students from 3-6 grade.
5,Little John,"This story is a heartwarming story of love between a man and his daughter and grandson. However, the clincher is: the daughter doesn't know that her father even knows the grandson, because she gave the baby up for adoption and she doesn't realize that her own father adopted him. The story shows the harm that miscommunication can do, but how the deep roots of love in a mother's heart break down the barriers."
3,Days of Publius' and Furianus' Lives,"As a high school latin teacher, Mr. Zoch is an interesting indiviual. After taking his class for two years, we have come to find that his personal opinions and preferences contribute to his teaching philosophy and view on history. His love for the Greatful Dead and ""Locked up Abroad"" have come to shape his class discussions. These odd subjects of fascination have contributed to his styles of writing. In his book Ancient Rome: An Introductory History, he uses these views to shape interesting stories. All in all this book shows what Paul Zoch can teach and his ability to shape uninteresting topics into stories that are easy to remember.Sincerely,Latin 2 2008/2009"
3,The Defects in Latin Education,"As I pondered what to write in this lonely page of the internet, i found that no words came to my mind. This is because this book did not arouse my senses or captivate me.I decided that my own personal opinion mattered not to the future readers so i researched by testing this book in many different street corners. I found a young clean cut mexican gentleman who stood on my street corner meeting up with large darken windowed vans exchanging small ziplock bags. (Most probably bologna sandwiches) I asked this young man, Brutus Hidalgo Tetanya, to read this book written by (in my opinion from the picture on the back of the book) a very good looking man. He took the book. Read it. Got up from his ripped up lawn chair. I never saw him again.Enough said."
5,It spoke to me...,"The Wall is not only the best Pink Floyd album (in my opinion) but it spoke to me. A lot of those songs are exactly how i feel right now in my life. sometimes i feel like Roger is singing to me. Crazy, i know, but its how it makes me feel. I am not going to sit here and say this and this is a good song because you have to experience this monster as a whole, and if possible, before watchng the movie, because although the film is excellent, it spoils your imagination when listening to the album. get your own vision of the music first and then perhaps watch the film (i recommend it too!!). and don't listen to those people who say Dark Side of the Moon is the best album... they overlooked a colossal masterpiece."
3,Like staring at a wall,"Pink Floyd's faux-masterpiece almost feels like the real thing at its beginning. It soon becomes clear that it's a narcissistic epic of self-pity, with a scope so small that Waters--who's running the show--might as well have been peering through a child's telescope at a brick wall. Some of it's good: ""The Happiest Days of Our Lives"" and its counterpart, ""Another Brick in the Wall,"" are excellent, and ""Comfortably Numb"" seems great. But the triumphs of those songs are shaved down by mediocre numbers and pieces like the revoltingly theatrical ""The Trial."" The story trips over itself, one imagines due to Waters' self-obsession. The lyrics are up and down, and the production is consistently empty. The album itself is down with a few ups, though Waters' egoism ensures that it's never quite as empty as it feels. I'll stick with ""Animals."""
5,Sweet Remastered edition!,The last Pink Floyd album with Roger Waters. A Sweet remastered edition that all Pink Floyd fans should have in their colection. Truly a band that introduced a NEW and ground breaking sound to Rock & Roll and changed the music world with a sound that is timeless.
1,Loved It As A Kid - Realize it's Overrated As An Adult,"This was THE album to have when it first came out. Unfortunately as I listen to it now, I see how much filler is on it!! I never realized it before.Yes, you get a handful of absolute classic songs (""Comfortably Numb"", ""Hey You"", ""Run Like Hell""). But man, ""Another Brick..(part 2) just sounds laughably dated now!!!!The rest...filler. Nice for nostalgic purposes, but don't believe the hype. ""Wish You Were Here"" is better"
1,LOL,"Yes, please ignore all the one star reviews! I wonder if the last reviewer is just SO used to putting in 1 star reviews that he accidently did that here! LOL, what a sad little man"
5,Pink Floyd is one of the greatest bands I listen to.,"I own the album The Wall and I listen to it every day. I also own The Division Bell, A Momentary Lapse Of Reason, Animals and Dark Side of the Moon. On August 7th I am going to see Roger Waters preform at Jones Beach theatre."
3,Overrated and self-indulgent,"When I was in High School I saw this album as a mantra for dissafected youth. I outgrew it rather quickly. What makes this such a weak album is that Richard Wright is not involved. Michael Kamen is a VERY poor substitute for Wright. Unfortunatly, Waters fired Wright early on into the sessions, seeing him as a rival for creative control of that band. But it was Wright's piano, played through his trademark Leslie speaker, that generated most of Floyd's classic songs. Kamen can't compete with that. Also, Wright sang better than Waters, who dominates the vocals. Only he doesn't usually sing on this album, mostly he just whispers or shouts. It's not without a few gems here and there: Hey You, Comforatbly Numb and Run Like Hell. But overall, ignore the hype and get Atom Heart Mother or Obscured By Clouds instead."
2,The most depressing music I have ever heard,"I like Pink Floyd. I once owned several PF vinyl LPs, back in the day. But when I heard this slab of gloom I just could not handle it. This is the most dark and depressing music that PF have ever released, and this is from a band that made a career of darkness and depression. So you can imagine just how bad this is.Musically, it's brilliant, but the lyrics and theme drag it all down into an abyss. Then the band released the movie and added depressing images to the music. I actually sat through The Wall movie in a theater and I felt like committing suicide when I left.I hope Roger Waters sought professional help after recording this."
1,What's up with this?,"Am I stupid? I was online looking to see when the new Pink Floyd album was coming out. I entered ""Pink Floyd"" and came here. The first thing I see is ""Pink Floyd Tribute:The Wall 2000. I asumed this was the new release and ordered it. What a dissapointment to get a COVER BAND! I never saw anything that mentioned that! Being a bass player in a band, I could just jam with my friends if I wanted to listen to a cover band! This cd is being sent right back!"
5,The Wall Delivers...,"Few albums have the inate ability to transcend the listener to another place and time. SInce this album was released in the early eighties, I have listened to it over 1000 times, first on vinyl, now on CD and it never ceases to amaze me how different details come out each time I listen. Roger Waters puts forth his most impressive work and this, coupled with David Gilmour taste for moving, symphonic guitar work, make The Wall a masterpiece. Now the movie is another issue!"
3,"strange, complex, sometimes great","The spirit of this music is sickly. An animal that needs to be shot. Its high points are sublime. It's never boring (it is making you sick or youre into it). Buy Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main Street, Hendrix, something that rocks before you open your wallet for this thing."
3,It's Tommy....,So its not terribly original. Its Tommy by the Who done as The Wall by Pink Floyd. It is better than the tripe put out after the break up of the group after this album and it is second to The Dark Side of the Moon for real Floyd productions. Pink Floyd is a name used by a bunch of aliens now.
2,Dump Waters,"I bought the CD because I watched David Gilmour on AOL's Sessions Archive and they played Comfortably Numb. I love that song. This CD is a disappointment. Even Comfortably Numb sounds better sung by David and his band then it did back in 1979.Save your money. This is just more of Roger Water's ranting and raving. He, for some reason, wanted to be a looney and that certainly comes across.I hope David and his present band make and album with old Pink Floyd favorites. They are so much better now, both vocally and accoustcally."
3,"Uneven, Wildlly Overrated","Rock operas are generally pretentious affairs, and Pink Floyd's hugely popular ""The Wall"" is no exception. A handful of standout songs are loosely cobbled together with a stretches of forgettable filler. The story --- such as it is --- is narcissistic and depressing, and it's best not to take it too seriously.Having said all that --- which will earn me the wrath of the Wall's many devoted fans --- I must concede that the classic tracks (Comfortably Numb, Hey You, Run Like Hell, Another Brick in the Wall Part 2, Young Lust) are worth the purchase price of the 2-disc set.I bought this album when it was released in 1979, and was disappointed in it then. Over the years I have listened to it on and off and it has improved with age; however for me it simply doesn't sustain the quality level that its legions of fans find in it."
1,Har Har Har,"The out of phase album clearly says T R I B U T E are you all stupid. Or would the floyd release a T R I B U T E album of their own work. OR would they call upon those nice marketing heads at their record company to develop a nice new case and book for The Wall LIVE album. By the way I bought 'Is anybody out there?' and it is quality, ah well boys and girls I'm sure the out of phase version is far better than a dodgy recording from the early 80's INNIT. I laugh at your misfortune"
5,Amazing!,"This is by far one of (possibly THE) best albums ever made.This is a masterpiece in every respect.There are the classic rock songs such as ""Hey You"",""Comfortably Numb"",and ""Run Like Hell"".But there are also others,such as ""The Trial"" which has an orchestra.This cd will amaze any who will take the time to listen and analyze beyond the surface.Go out and buy it now!"
5,pink floyd the wall remastered,"I've always wanted this record, but retail chains were too expensive. Thanks for making it available."
4,Back to the Future.,"Even though these recordings were made in the 70s, I still believe that ""Pink Floyd"" was instrumental in shaping the future of rock.They were far ahead of their time and, with the exception of U2, they are one of the most copied and popular rock bands.Pieces such as- ""Another Brick in the Wall"" part 1 2 and 3, ""Hey You,"" ""Is Anybody Out There?"" and ""Bring the Boys Back Home"" are all rock classics."
4,Well cemented bricks,"Although it lacks the vision behind Beatle's White or the dexterity of Lamb Lies from Genesis, The Wall can take its place amongst rock's finer double album's; if not accentuating production subtlety certainly producing a virtual hit factory which could joyously be disassembled piece by piece."
5,The best album ever.,"Once I listened to this album I was hooked to Pink Floyd. Possibly the best album Pink Floyd did, along with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon, and Wish You Were Here in my opinion. I prefer this be the first album you listen to If your not a Pink Floyd fan. The first song on this album that really got interested in Pink Floyd was Comfortably Numb. So, If your going to buy a Pink Floyd album for the first time I prefer The Wall."
3,Tear down the wall,"Overrated! This is a good album, but I don't think it's as good as most people say it is. It has some good songs. ""Run like hell"" is awesome! The trial is unbelievable! I just don't think this is Floyd's best at all."
3,The Wall = eh...,"Pink Floyd is one of my favorite bands, but I can't say I like The Wall that much... Roger took too much of it into his own hands. The tracks Gilmour collaborated on are the true greats. If you get this, get it for Young Lust, Hey You, Comfortably Numb, etc... the rest is just dismal filler however."
1,WTF are the Beatles doing on Second Disk,"This is not a review of The Wall. I love the Album and consider it one of the Greatest ever made. This is a review of the disks I received. For some reason, the second disk is The Beatles Live at the BBC. Now, I have nothing against the Beatles. I wanted The Wall though. The disc has The Wall art on it, and lists the songs from The Wall, but I get The Beatles."
1,Disgustipated,"I havent bough this CD but... I think an attempt at creating a dance version of The Wall is a pretty cool idea in this day and age. But this is crap. Just listen to the sound files on this page, and if you havent heard the original Pink Floyd album, listen to the sound files for that and compare. No contest. Even if you somehow dont like the original The Wall, how can you like this?? So sterile and lifeless. Especially the vocals, its like a moron singing in his sleep, no really. Also, they could have at least made this album on a decent whatever the hell it is you use to make all these lame sounds called techno. But it sounds like a MIDI file, frighteningly so. The same goes for their horrible attempt at Dark Side of the Moon 2001. Hello, Out of Phase?? What are you doing? Talk about a bad career choice. You guys suck."
5,Backdoor Boys they are not.......,"If you like shallow, meaningless songs like the Backstreet Boys or Snoop Dogg would write, you will hate the wall. The Wall is a true concept album (or an album with a theme that is expressed with each song). It follows the life of a social outcast, and documents the experiences and feelings he (Pink) experiences. The music is very diverse, ranging from arena rock, to funk, pop, classical, etc. Some amazing guitar work and artistic expression make this arguably the best album from Pink Floyd. If you like classics, and good music with lyrics that require an attention span, buy The Wall. IT OWNS YOU!!!!!!!"
5,The Wall is one of the greatest albums of all time!,"For anyone who is a fan of a true musical ""expierience""-Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" is for you. Argueabley the greatest Floyd disc ever, this 2 CD rock epic takes you through the dark alley that is lead singer Roger Waters' mind. His life story is told so well through ""Comfortabley Numb"" and ""Hey You""-this Disc is a MUST own for any true Floyd fan!!"
5,Great Work,"This is a great albulm. I had listened to Dark Side of the Moon before ,and liked it ,but I didn't appriciate this till I was a little older. The journey through life leading to insanity is great ,and upheld by great songs like Hey You and Comfortabley Numb."
2,"Like 3 Good Songs, The Rest Is horrible filler","I can't believe I wasted my money on this awful album... I mean, yes ""comfortably numb"" is a great song, ""Hey you"" is a great song"", ""Young Lust"" is a great song, but everything else is AWFUL..."
3,Almost great.,"The Wall is a masterpiece, and will always be so. Yet this box is not. Perhaps if it had been the first of the Immersion boxes to come out, I would give it a higher rating, but having been spoiled by the 5.1 mixes on the first two sets, as well as the brilliant supplements, I was rather disappointed that there would not only be no 5.1 mix in this set, but that part of the package was just a repurposed live set that's been commercially available for 10 years. A must-have for completists (if only for the demo versions of pieces from the album), but a maybe for the rest."
3,"Get over it guys, it's only a tribute","Unlike most of the others who have reviewed this album, I am not going to moan about it not sounding like Pink Floyd. Of course it doesn't sound like the original album.....It is a tribute, made by a band 20 years later....i would have been bored with a carbon copy of the original. Out Of Phase have put something of themselves into the work, and i am sure that any band who is willing to take the time to make a 2CD tribute to Pink Floyd, holds the band in the highest respect. Yes....some of the mixes are a little unusual, and the album didn't flow like Pink Floyds....but lets face it.....It's hard to better perfection. Good effort Out Of Phase......I like it!"
4,Pink Floyd the Wall CD re-mastered box set,"Great for what it is... a walk through my pimply teenage years in the late 80s.What can I say I wanted to re-live that era of my life for a week, then I sold the CD to a re-sale record store.Excellent just as I remembered, but since I overplayed it in my geeky youth, I felt no need to keep it around from fear that someone might think me a pot-head redneck midwest spaz.Still, if yer into the Pink.... buy it."
1,False Advertising...I want my money back!,"I have been a 'Wall' fan since the movie came out but have never owned the CD. I went to the CD store and bought this thinking it was a remastered copy that was remastered by 'Out of Phase' and would therefore be the original but with better quality sound. When I listened to it, I was utterly disappointed to hear that it was a stinkin' techno mix! What a bummer. I will try to get my money back or a credit or exchange it for the real CD today. Heck, I'll even take a Brittany Spears CD over this ... Don't buy this 'version', ...!"
3,Another Brick Falls From The Wall,"This album is okay, but is extremly overrated. There is only one good song ( Another Brick On The Wall - Part 2 ). I remember being in grade 8 in the 1990 - 1991 school year and all my friends raved about the album & said how great it was. So I borrowed the album from my bestfriend. I listened to it, I thought ""GOD THIS ALBUM REALLY SUCKS BIG TIME"". I was totally diaspointed. In my opinion stick with Led Zeppelin IV as a difinitive 70's rock album - Thank You 4 Your Time - Peace!"
1,Not what I expected...,"After all the hype over this CD I was expecting a little bit more...Don't get me wrong I'm a HUGE Jamie Fox fan and love the ""Unpredictable"" track, but the rest of the CD is sorely lacking from start to finish."
1,Garbage!,"I was VERY disappointed in this CD. I truly thought Jamie Foxx had musical talent, but this is pure GARBAGE. The lyrics are very tacky. Too bad, because I was very excited to buy the CD and now, I can't wait to trade it in."
2,"Great voice, Great actor, but Mediocre CD","This CD has about 4 really good songs on it, but I wish I had just gone on iTunes and bought those 4 songs individually because I spent $19 on an overall MEDIOCRE CD. If you're like me, and you want almost the whole CD to be great, don't buy this! I'm a big fan of Jamie Foxx, and I still really enjoy him in many ways, but GREAT music is GREAT music. And this is just MEDIOCRE music!"
2,There must be something else to sing about!!!,"I've liked Jamie Foxx ever since I saw him as Wanda on In Living Color and on his show when he would sing sometime, I just couldn't wait from him to make an album so that I could hear him sing all the time. Now that he has it's really disappointing!! I've only listened to it three times hoping that I could find a couple of songs I could like but nothing. I still like Jamie Foxx but if he makes another album like this, I think he should just stick to what he does best... ACTING!!!"
3,I shouldn't have rushed,"I got this CD on the strength that Jamie was going to come correct,in other words,he was going to embrace the revolution of live instruments and really soulful vocals.This CD had let me down on so many levels.I dug the tributes to his grandmother and his daughter-the rest of it he could've kept.Jamie has the hot hand right now and i feel bad that i was a contributing factor to this maddness."
4,For Mature Adults,"Each song is a hit for me. Individually, I liked each one. Collectively though, I felt the sex theme was too much. There were a few songs that weren't sex oriented, which allowed me to sit through a complete listening.The guest appearances are a nice touch and probably make the CD better than it would have been without them."
3,Sloooooow - all the way,"After hours music for lovers - this album is sloooooow - all the way! Ballad after ballad after ballad after ballad. I kept waiting for it to change tempo for at least one track, but it never did. The songs are fairly pleasing to listen to but none of them really grabbed me or made me want to hear them again. He is no Marvin Gaye. Given the collaborations on the album I was hoping for something outstanding and I came away feeling it was mediocre at best. Sorry Jamie, I'm a big fan but don't give up the acting!"
3,"Its Ok, But.....","i""ve Been a fan of Jamie Foxx Since in Living Color and i think that he has a lot of talent and can out sing the best of them, but this album could of been so much better. Dont get me wrong it is ok but theres no musical growth between this album and Peep This ( His First Album).I Think that Jamie Should have wrote all the songs him self. I think thats what the problem is, he let everybody put in there input and this is what the outcome became. Im reading a lot of these reviews of people dissing the album and i dont know what they were expecting some pop bubble gum stuff. Jamie Foxx is by no means For the TRL crowd and im sure he aint trying to be .Jamie is good at what he does but theres always room for improvement and Jamie does need stepped his game up just a little bit cuz his is a bit rusty musicly considering his last album was 10 years ago.. IM not dissing im just telling it how it is. Hopefully on his hext album he take more conrol of his music and not let tank come near it."
4,It is Unpredictable!!!!!,This CD is very great and I bought it for Christmas gifts. It has music for everyone to enjoy. It has mellow songs to club music to gospel. He is a very talented man and I commend him on a great CD.
2,Very predictable....,"This CD is like most R&B today. Boring. With the exception of ""Heaven"" and ""VIP"" this sounds just like every other R&B song out there. Like R&B itself these days, Foxx's CD is very predictable. Obviosusly, Foxx is smart enough to realize that he has to market his CD towards women, so most of the songs are something that women would probably get into. Although, they have to be somewhat turned off by his ""player"" style. Foxx does sound good as a singer, but his song choices fail him in the end. As I said ""Heaven"" and ""VIP"" are the only songs worth listening to on here. As the other songs are dull and very predictable."
3,very predictable and boring,"I just purchased the ""long awaited"" CD from the one and only Jamie Foxx. I think he's been hanging around the wrong people in the studio. They are not your real friends Jamie cause if they were someone would've told you that this CD is not even close to a classic. That's what I would strive for if I made a CD. And with a voice like Jamie's it is wasted talent to do such mediocre songs. Kanye West ruined the Extravanganza song. The song with Snoop on it is Garbage. The song about his Grandmother (I wish you were here) is a good song. The title song featuring Ludacris is a good song but overall the CD is predictable and boring. I really like Jamie Foxx more than the next person so I'm not hating. I'm being as truthful as I can with my review."
3,It's ok,"I was excited when I heard Karen was onto a new project but disappointed at the result. Is it too much Israel and not enough Karen? I don't know and, this is coming from a TRUE KCS fan from way back in the day! But, the atmosphere just didn't come through. Maybe I expected too much."
4,This is Not Daft Punk. It's Never Going to be Daft Punk.,"In listening to Justice's album 'Cross' one gets the distinct, almost inescapable, sense that this band really, really, really wants to be Daft Punk. Sadly, the only people that can pull that off are already walkin' around with goofy helmets and hanging out with Kanye West. That being said, this is a really good album. There's a lot of creativity and talent that comes across in 'Cross'. A great 'discovery' for anyone with that 7 year itch."
2,Noise,"I can't even begin to see how they equate Justice with Daft Punk!! This isn't techno and it's certainly not rock or punk. It's noise, alright? It's Chemical Brothers if the Chemical Brothers had no rhythm... or an insanely short attention span. When I listen to Techno or Dance music, I need some kind of element to tie it all together... to facilitate the musical journey, if you will... a beat. Justice keeps throwing in different shrill sounds and... Hell, they make Ministry and the whole Industrial movement sound almost classical. Sorry guys, but I don't get it. Justice sounds to me like bad noise. The only decent track there contains a sample from an Italian dance song.J'suis desole les mecs, but when you compare Justice to others often lumped into contemporary ""French sound"": Air, Daft Punk, Kid Loco, and many others... these guys leave lots to be desired."
4,Influencial Musicians,When i first heard the album I was blown away by the cover Turn The Page. Kirk's immitation of the sax is awesome. The riffs on this album are superb...not many bands could cover this music and/or write solos etc that fit the way metallica did. Some songs are very fast and satanic others are mellow yet heavy. I have been playing guitar for 7 yrs and still cant play half of whats on the album. The made the songs more appealing to this generation. Its worth listening to ...
2,Keep away from the CD with the new covers!,"Only the CD with the old covers is worthwhile. The new one is horrible, with bad song selection, played without heart, almost in remote control. Another clever step by recent money-lovers Hetfield and Ulrich.."
2,Regarding Mr. Wisconsin's review on Feb. 22:,"Mr. Wisconsin used to hate Metallica, but after hearing the ""Turn the Page"" cover, he likes them. What does THAT say about this album...lesser than your average rock album."
1,"worse than catching your parents ""doing it""","Are you sick of new metallica? Were you turned off of metallica when you heard the phrases ""understanda"" and ""be not affraid""? Metallica could have at leat covered some good bands (with the exception of the black sabbath and motorhead showing they have at least some taste in music.) Come on wake up Metallica is the Hanson of the metal world (now atleast)"
1,THERE AIN'T ENOUGH STARS BELOW 1 CAUSE THIS IS SAD!!!,Quite possibly this the worst album Metallica have done since And justice for all... Metallica were finished with ever since Cliff Burton died (he must be spinning in his grave). Take my advice don't bother with this sad excuse for an album.
3,Good for the second disk,"If you are a longtime fan of Metallica im sure you've already heard some of the songs on disk two. It is disk one im worried about. It seems im not the only one either, i've seen alot of terrible reviews for disk one. Yes it is true, disk one lacks inspiration making the covers dull and boring. Just look at the track list and compare it to disk two. If you like Metallica and don't have the b-sides on disk two then I reccomend this. If you happen to have these somewhat rare gems then pass this by and never look back."
4,Hard to find cover's CD.......found!,"I'm with accordance with everyone else about the greatness of this collection. I do defer on CD 2 being the superior of the two. CD 1 is very innovative (Astronomy, Whiskey in a Jar), also the medley of Mercyful Fate. Don't get me wrong, CD 2 is good (Am I Evil, Stone Cold Crazy, & Breadfan), but Metallica of the past thrash is rehashed by every other new thrash metal band. Read the liner notes to ""Tuesday's Gone"" to see if Metallica is respected by other artist's of rock."
4,Metallica is the best.,Although the songs on the Garage Inc. cd`s are`nt theirs Metallica is still a great band.They will always be in my top ten list.No matter who`s songs they are singing they still sound great.
3,"I agree, throw away the first disc","If there really is a ""clean"" version of Garage Inc. then Metallica is becoming more of a sell-out than I thought. The first disc, with some exceptions, is: ""Let's record any old crap and our fans will buy it"", the second is real Metallica, raw, vibrant. Metallica plays Motorhead better than Motorhead."
4,"It's pretty good, just not like puppets, ride, or justice","Look, this cd was great compared to any other damn cd out there other than metallica's other cds. I don't understand why people are saying metallica is a sell out, and, to put it bluntly, those people are stupid. garage still ranks up there with the other metallica cds. Frankly i would want to have metallica make a cd with about 10 songs, half 80s style half 90s style. That would be the best."
4,Pretty good,"I thought that Garage Inc. was a great album but some of the songs aren't so great. some of the songs, though were great. i'd recommend this to any one who likes rock"
5,Another metal masterpiece by the gods of thrash!!,"Jaymz, Kirk, Larz, and Jayson Newkid prove their musical excellence again by releasing a tribute album to their idles and mentors. 5 stars worthy and an album that pays the utmost respect to all of our favorite musicians that started it all. Misfits, Anti-nowhere league, blue oyster cult, motorhead, Queen, Sabbath, Zepplin and Seger, some of the best musicians ever to hit guitar hit the metallicats hard enough so that today we the next generation listeners can appreciate the classics in pure metallica fashion."
4,"An okay album, but I wish they did a better job on it","This is an alright album, and since it is the censored version I gave it 4 stars...I would probably give the regular version 4 stars, but the only song they cut out on here is ""So What"", and I dont even listen to that song much anyway. I picked the edited Garage up on accident, because none of their previous albums had parental advisories on them. So I figured what the heck, and then I heard all these cuss words on someone else's cd and I was like, whoa...what is wrong with mine? And I will tell you, that annoying ""beeping"" sound gets to your nerves once in awhile. They just dont blurp them out, it makes a loud -beep-. So my advice to you is, if you like hearing beeping sounds that is cool, but if you dont, get the explicit version...and if you dont like cuss words, just skip the ""So What"" track on disc two. That is my advice and have a nice day :)"
3,"not bad, some good covers.","this album is a mixed bag of goodies, there are a lotof songs covered from some awesome bands, like motorheaddischarge and mercyful fate. one question though, if metallicawas influenced heavly by NWOBHM bands, then how come therewern't more songs from that era of music? how come there areno venom covers or saxon covers? surley ulrich listenedto those bands alot, right? i gave it three stars mainlybecause there are songs on here that just do not fit metallica.they should of covered more NWOBHM stuff which they wereinfluenced by. it would of been ultra cool to hear themcover a iron maiden or judas preist song or even an accept song( althoug i do belive hetfeild would have had to smoke abouta 1000 cigarettes and eat a box of nails to do an accept songjustice!) oh well, it was a solid effort anyhow."
3,"Well, it is a lot better than reload","Well, I bought this album thinking it was going to rule. I was wrong. THe second CD is GREAT. But I already have it. The only decent cover on the first CD is the Mercyful Fate medley. Don't buy this CD, you already have half of it, and just get a friend to make a copy of the Mercyful Fate medley on CDR"
2,"ummmmmmmm...how can i put it,oh yeah,THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!","where should i start.....well first uv all itz their WORST album yet,itz sooo sell out,if ya r a real metallica fan,then go and buy AND JUSTICE FOR ALL and die happY:)"
5,metallica still blowing our metal heads.,"a very good album,who said that metallica passed off? they are wrong,really 1st time i heared this album i like it so much,really some of the songs played better than the original bands.metal heads just listen and enjoy the power of metal."
3,Good but disjointed,"I really, really wanted to give this a positive review, but I can't. Individually, the songs on here are fantastic, especially the cover of Bob Seger's ""Turn the Page"" and ""Whiskey in the Jar."" As an album though, the band shifts styles dramatically from track to track, making it extremely difficult to listen to straight through. It sounds like I played it on random.Don't get me wrong, it's still a decent album. I would have just liked to see it flow a little more smoothly."
1,"Doesn't compare to Seger, don't buy it.","""Turn the Page"" and ""Tuesday's Gone"" are two of the worst remakes I ever heard. I don't want to be opinionated, but I've been upset with the last several of Metallica's albums. They're just not the same as they used to be. I'm sorry if I hurt any feelings, but it's just not what it should be."
1,what ever happened to the real metallica?,"has anyone else noticed how pathetic metallica has become? if you haven't, then listen to ""garage, inc."" this is without a doubt,the worst album i've ever heard. every song is a pathetic waste of time. especially when you compare it with metallica's older stuff. i mean, they don't even sound like the same band. ""turn the page"", give me a break. when did metal bands start covering bob seger? of course metallica isn't metal anymore, so i guess they thought it would be ok. as for me, i'll listen to REAL metal, like NEVERMORE, SENTENCED, AMORPHIS, PARADISE LOST, and many other true metal bands. you can have metallica, i'll take true metal!!!!!"
1,Why can't I give it 0 stars?,"OK, last time my review wasn't posted - understandable, these people are trying to SELL these CDs. They can: if you're a sworn Metallica fan, go ahead and buy it. But if you're a heavy metal fan - I'll say only one thing: skip ALL of Metallica after ""Black"", and SPECIALY this album. Making 2 CDs of covers was a bad joke, guys."
2,Garage Inc. rightfully called Garbage Inc.,"When I say this, I mean this, I am the biggest Metallica fan out there, I absolutly love their music. When I first bought this album I knew it was all covers. Well in short I bought this, and I found about 7 songs that I liked on it. Usually on Metallica's CD's I like all of them, and I never I mean NEVER get tired of hearing them. After about a month I couldn't stand to hear them any longer. This CD isn't that muscially good. But in part, I need to say that Metallica is still the greatest band ever. They just played covers, made millions on it, hey I dont blame them, dont buy this album, just listen to it somewhere else."
5,A great piece of work,"a great cd, worth the money, don't buy (clean version)i didn't but i can imagine how annoying it must be."
1,Tiny Heart,"I was very disappointed when I received my bracelet. I packaged it up and returned it immediately. From the pictures, I believed that the bracelet was of a substantial size. Instead I found that it looked like it belonged on a baby or a young teen. The hearts were about half the size of a pea. I was disappointed. You might not be. But understand that pictures can be deceiving."
5,Great Gift,Bought this and the Plankton Beanie Baby for a friend's daughter. She instantly loved them and said she had the best birthday ever.
1,EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT,"I purchased this for my son to give my daughter for her 3rd birthday. I was very happy to read that it was a nice size, great value price. I assumed it WOULD be a good size because the item description says it weighs 3 pounds. To my extreme disappointment when I opened the box, this Gary weighs MAYBE 3 ounces! Although my daughter loves it, I was very upset. Almost heartbroken that it was so much smaller than described. I feel cheated!"
4,Gary.........,"My daughter ordered this for her birthday with a gift card she had received. She loves Gary, but the shipping was MORE then he was which ate up her whole entire card. I wasn't too pleased with that as a Mother. So beware of overpriced shipping!"
3,A Little Disappointed,I was very disappointed that the Nat King Cole song was not featured on this soundtrack. I love all of the songs but adding the lyrical version of Nat King Cole's song would have been the final bonus to complete this CD.
3,Good,"The author was the only Iceland ace in WW II, flying the RAF. This book was a bestseller in Iceland, and a long time before the author decided to make a translation, himself, to the British language. In doing so, he took out some parts of the book (like he says in the perface) because they would be a little bit boring to foreign readers. Anyway, it's a good reading, there is some action, good photos, amazing graphic quality of the printing."
4,TOUCHING NARRATIVE,"DANCING IN THE SKIES is the touching narrative of the only Iceland pilot to fly with RAF in World War II. Serving the customary high numbers of Sqaudrons, he stayed most of the time with 111 Squadron, the famed Treble One. Then, at the end of the War he was transfered to Iceland and soon retired from RAF. Very good style, a real classic. Highly recommended !"
3,A warm story...,"If you like warm and sweet stories, this book is for you! I enjoyed the book, but I didn't love it. It's my personal preference that I prefer stories that aren't too sweet. So, I don't want to take away from the review.The book is nicely written. Characters are well developed. And the author touches on tough issues within this novel.People who look for sweet romance won't be disappointed. The author created a great scene when heroine and hero admitted love for one another. That scene was worth waiting for...."
4,Quite good,"Even for when this was recorded, Nixon was spot on with most of his observations and what he thought was around the corner in the political scene.My only complaint would be that it could be longer, but that's about it."
5,It's about time this came out on dvd,"I saw this way back on HBO and I was amused that they showed full nudity. This photographer is taking pictures of adult porn stars both male and female, they take the pictures at home at a friends house, at work or the gym. Through the whole documentary while their taking the picture they are talking about the whole porn industry the whole life style."
5,Exquisite,"It's comforting to know there's someone out there -- way out there -- making music with such imagination and intelligence. These songs distinguish themselves from most contemporary music the way all great art distinguishes itself: with real dynamic variety. It's there in the rich arrangements, their crescendos and diminuendos. It's there in the tension between Dr. Duffy's frenetic beats and his distended melodies. It's even there in his sense of humor: listen to ""Liberty Street,"" for God's sake, and listen closely. When that simple, poignant vocal sample comes around for the third time, Duffy can't help but come in with the harmony. And the harmony is so compelling he can't help but exclaim, ""Woo!"" Then he immediately reintroduces the beat. The effect is that of a quick cutaway in a really good movie. What a light touch this guy's got. And what an ear. Buy his album. You'll ""Woo!"" too."
2,A lot of Intellectualism Won't Obscure the Truth,"Losers who enjoy playing their casio keyboards could have an interest in this CD, but I'm miffed at why some reviewers insist Way Out Here is a good alternative to current music they dislike. I love how some conveniently mention that the composer holds a professional degree--it's irrevelant. If electronica-style music is what you like, you may enjoy this. I didn't like Way Out Here, but I'm used to listening to creative music. A primary criteria in my evaluation of music is whether I want to listen again, not some flaky intellectual notion of merit. The world offers a lot of quality music--even currently--for those that seek it out. Regardless, a group, band, or musical style generating millions in record sales from mediocre or bad albums is not dehumanizing to anyone. Besides, you shouldn't use this crummy CD as an example of good music. Unless your 22-years-old or younger, I hope your not commenting on popular-music styles anyway."
2,Say Bye Bye to this Birdie,"Has Strouse ran out of ideas, so that he has to bring back the dead. Annie Warbucks is a classic when compared to this tuneless and totally unnecessary sequel."
1,"quiet, but doesn't move enough air","This fan doesn't move much air out of the bathroom at all. Also, the lights in it have somehow turned the plastic piece covering the lightbulbs a yellowish brown... it looks like they're too close to the plastic and are discoloring it from being hot maybe? Either way I wish I had bought something else. I have a panasonic fan in my other bathroom and it works MUCH better and is just as quiet."
3,this is a good try by the group,"this group have done well in the UK but i would like to known wher they got in the charts in the U,S,A."
2,Merely An Okay Read,"I love most of JB's books, but this one? I just don't get it. It wasn't that romantic, and the story was weak. The characters were very bland. The best thing about this book is when Nicholas from AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE is in it and says the line: ""Even so."""
2,Don't buy this CD if you are thinking on Deep Dish remix!,"I bought this CD because I was thinking on the 'Deep Dish Vocal Remix' (which is about 9 minutes lenght), but SURPRISE! it IS NOT the Vocal Remix, but Vocal Remix EDITED, so it is just 4:10 min.Amazon, of course, doesn't say anything about lenghts."
2,Not All That Good,The album version is the best version on this single. This song is a peaceful song. The dance remixes aren't doing this song any justice. Just stick to the original.
4,Greta's review,"This book is sad but at the same time interesting. I think it should be rated four stars. The Circuit doesn't have a happy ending. A summary of this book is, a boy named Panchito and his family sneak illegally over the border from Mexico to America when he is about six years old. The book ends when he is around fourteen years old. Panchito for parts of the year and goes to school in other parts. He and his family have to move a lot. Torito, Panchito's little brother gets very sick and may not live. They are very are very poor and have to work very hard for money. Panchito has a big family, he has a mom, dad, and seven sisters and brothers. Overall I don't really like how this book skips his ages like 7-12 or 6-8. Also, there was lots of words in Spanish I couldn't understand. This book would probably be good for ages 10-15. I learned that you should be thankful for what you have and there are people who are more poor than you and who can barely afford anything."
3,The Circuit,"This book makes us remember what the American Dream is, that there is freedom for everyone here, and freedom does not discriminate."
2,If You're Looking For NO Action...,"It starts out with this Mexican family illegally coming across the border into the United States. When they get to the U.S., they go to a labor camp in California. This first labor camp is probably the best one that they go to. The whole book is about this family moving around to different labor camps during different crop seasons. Every now and then, Francisco and his brother Roberto go to school. Along the way there are more people added to the family. The book doesn't really come to a good ending. It is also kind of hard to understand because it jumps three years into the future at times and then you don't know what's going on.This was a very good book at some times but most of the time the author put in way too many unnecessary details that make the book kind of boring. This book is exactly like it's sequel, Breaking Through. I would rate this book pretty low if like a lot of action."
5,A must read for all ages,"Francisco Jimenez brilliantly captures the voice of the young Panchito and the struggles and triumphs of his migrant family. The issue of Mexican immigration has become become hotly bebated, causing us to sometimes lose sight of the human vioce of those about which we so passionately talk. Jimenez's stories transform our understanding of Mexican sojourners, moving us from an abstract understanding of Mexican immigrantion to a more humane frame of mind. In essence, these twelve short-stories enable us to bear witness so that we may make a compassionate connection with those people who are represented by Jimenez's stories. What is more, the style with which Jimenez writes makes this book enjoyable for all ages. The Circuit should propel Jimenez into an arena with the great Chicano authors of our time."
1,dave r,I wasn't happy with it at all. It looks nothing like the picture they show. It looks totally different.
1,Skip this shower radio,"I got this shower radio for Christmas and was excited. Also, the radio is only splash proof and can only withstand a small amount of steam. Because of this I didn't feel comfortable hanging it directly under the shower head by the rope, so I used the suction cups and placed it at the far end of the shower. But, I was constantly afraid that the suction cups would fail and the radio would fall. I used it exactly TWICE (total time was about 30 minutes) when the volume (on/off) button broke. Thankfully I still had the packaging but I had to pull it out of the trash can to return this thing. Think I'm going to try to find a different shower radio."
3,It will do for now,"I bought a second Jwin mirror radio for shower shaving when the first one stopped working. It's not my first choice because its an obvious ""made in china"" carnival prize quality item. The thing is there's just about no others out there and the few that are look like their construction is worse or the price is 4-5x more.I'd give it a year of use before it quits on me but that's what I expected when I bought it."
4,A little night music.,"Haven't heard this since I was a kid. These themes echo the originals and are performed with attention to their thrilling qualities. They may not be the original soundtrack recordings, but they have a verisimilitude which explores some of the audacity of classic horror. So often modern recordings approach horror themes melodiously to their detriment. These performances sound like their trying to freak you out, happily."
5,Great show that hopefully doesn't die too young.,Nathan Fillion does it again. This is one of the best new shows and I hope ABC picks it up for many seasons to come
5,Please give us more,Castle is one of my favorite shows on television right now! Nathan Fillion (Castle) and Stana Katic (Becket) have such fantastic on screen chemistry. The supporting cast is perfect! I can only hope that this show is renewed so we can have more fantastic comedy!
5,Best show ever.,Castle is one of my most favorite shows ever. I love watching the chemistry between Castle and Beckett each week and their minds work so closely together
3,Better than most,"Generically speaking, as TV shows go, this one IS better then most.If you're specifically looking for a ""CSI"" type show though, you will be rather disappointed.This shows strength isn't in it's ""crime drama"" (pretty thin on that front) or it's plots (VERY formulaic. Every episode is exactly the same, just a different method of murder each week). There are lots of supporting characters but as of season two, they remain 2 dimensional and .No, this is just a re-tooled version of ""Moonlighting"" or any other ""boy/girl, underlaying awkward tension, episodic TV show"".What makes this show worth watching (and ""fun"" even) is Nathan Fillion. Not that the rest of the cast isn't good, he just has a presence that pulls the normal into the ""above average"". Still, the show itself (while above average for network TV) is pretty thin."
5,Great Show,"This is a great show, and the first season was excellent. The DVD came in new condition as I expected, and shipping was quick."
1,bad copy,Only because I am bit lazy but I should had returned this purchase.This could not had been an original DVD. The sound was terrible and the image was worse.I should find the time to make a formal complaint about this purchase.
2,I wont buy from this company again....,I bought these bowls at a local store and the paint chipped on them. I emailed the company and they sent me new bowls and said that the previous paint had a defect.... well low and bohold the paint on the bowls is still coming off!!!?? and the bowls are super sticky like the butter is adhereing to them and I cannot get them completely clean....(gross)... so im off to find new popcorn bowls. I wouldnt buy from this company again as it seems their standards are low for this product.....use a paint that doesnt come off!!! (btw I never once put these in the dishwasher... this is hand washing)
5,Great concert,"This is a very good blueray. All of the audio is very very good. I'm listening to it on a Pioneer VSX 1018 biwired to Eosone rsf-600's. Simply amazing, sounds better than a lot of concerts i've been to."
5,Alive at Red Rocks,"Truly one of the best things ive ever had the pleasure of viewing. It makes you feel like you are there. Absolutely wonderful, I highly recomomend getting it."
5,Great book,"Just to say how much I enjoyed this book. I got it as a Christmas present, and I am reading it, and enjoying it so much. The thing I like about it is that the text is simple and the pictures are really interesting. The graphics are great. It gives you an overview of the history of Christianity which I find so useful. I highly recommend this book which I have heard is already translated into several languages."
4,"good book, but......","It's a bit difficult to read, but the content is excellent.for insights into the Founders' thinking for the Constitution. Recommended reading for all Conservatives.......should be mandatory reading for Liberals."
2,Not Recommended,"It's a great concept. Unfortunately, it didn't work that well for me. Even in the bright sunlight here in Colorado, I could only charge 2 NMH batteries at the same time. And it won't work through a window. Not very good for $110.Tech support? They have one guy, and you have to call the main switchboard - they don't have a tech support number. Good luck reaching him. I left him a message 3 days ago and never heard back. As far as I'm concerned, their tech support is non-existent.I returned mine."
5,Wonderfully showcases a major poetic talent,"Daughter Of wonderfully showcases a major poetic talent offering readers an introduction to the lyrical abilities of Linda McCarriston in diverse formats of verse that collectively and candidly reveal life experiences of girls and women. Before and After: Giddy, Queen of the May,/tipsy with unfocused possibility,/now I'm in a Twelve Step program./Sober, I walk the line gravity draws./But no, you're no cold rainfall,/more a steady sun, a solid plot/that grows when tended, invites me/to tend, then tends me tenderly./So that's how it is. The Rootless one/takes root and sometimes feels confined./The Planted one grows restless./What is love if not this steady echo,/systole, diastole? The way salt/mimics sugar, or water rests on oil."
4,Gramhoneybee,Enjoyable read! I love the fact the author put in extras for parents/grandparents when reading this with your child or grandchild.
1,No Evidence!,"Of course, the contents of this book are complete rubbish! None of these claims are supported by evidence. Why is it ok to produce something fantastical and promote it as fact. Bleh!"
4,Gave as a gift,"I actually didn't read the book, I gave it as a gift, but the receiver was very pleased and enjoyed it."
1,ugh,The pages look like they came out of an old typewriter with an over-used ribbon.The print is pale and the font is fine so it is very hard to read. The pages are even the same size as typewriter paper. I haven't been able to read beyond the 2nd chapter - I bought the book for pleasure - but it's work to read this.
2,Fell asleep reading it!,"soo boring, ir started good but I just got to the middle of it before i fell asleep.... I was waiting for a better read but i could have been more disappointed, I really tried to finish really but couldn`t.The characters were very define in their personalities but the story was not very entertaining for me at least."
1,garbage!!!,"terrible scans (the paper shifts causing crooked or wavy scans plus scan quality is poor), terrible OS - contantly crashes or even hangs up my pc, terrible tech support. my old Vx worked great for many years- even though it was just black and white and the tech support was almost useless - but it's was not compatible with XP so i had to get rid of it. do NOT buy the XP100 unless you really need more stress in your life."
3,It' s ok,"It' s ok, it scans good quality as long as it works. Mine started making a black line in the middle of scans after 1 year of use. The customer service is phone call only, last time I called for some trouble in connecting it, they rrrr'ed me like I didnt know what I was doing so I didnt bother call them again for an explanation for the dark line in the middle of the scans.Who cares, i may buy another one, or just forget about it. The HP scanner I used to have had lower quality scanned color documents so I may come back to this one cause it does have good quality scans when it wants to work."
1,Black streaks after a year this is the scanner for you.,"I acquired this scanner and after a year it started creating black streaks down the page called support after I had determined it was a scanner problem not a dirt problem like their knowledge base suggests it is.They do not offer repairs on this onl to let you buy a new one another $180+ BS, I am buying a neat receipts now and see how they are about repairs.I only use it on the road for scanning receipts for expese reports even with streaks it works ok for that but I do use it on occassion for scans that the streaks are not ok for.Travis"
1,I'll let ya know,I guess its unfair to review this movie as I havent made it past the first five minutes. I will keep trying when I have some time to waste...of course I wil probably need some help staying awake
2,Doesn't work,"The kids got it for Christmas, and it looked like fun. However, the one we got doesn't work at all. I'm not sure if we just got a bad one or if this problem is common, but I can't even get it to turn on without changing the batteries, and then I can't get it to go into the game mode. Plus, the rules of the electronic version are different, in that you lose all your points if you keep acting out words. I prefer the rules of the old version better. I'm planning to return this and get the old version."
5,A gripping book on what it means to love God.,"Chuck Colson is a great story teller, and he gives many gripping illustrations of what it means to love God in our everyday lives. He then ties it in with relevant Scripture passages. It's a very engaging read, and you won't be disappointed with it.The big lesson I got from it is that loving God is not just something that we say with our lips. But it's something that we demonstrate with what we do with our time and with our lives. I was especially touched by the story of the woman who shows her love for God by donating her lunch hour every day to leading a prayer and Bible study time at a nearby prison. She has six kids at home. But she felt compelled to do something extra for Jesus each day.The book is full of examples like this, and it turned out to be very satisfying."
3,The perfect movie for sisters,The movie got good when Diane Keaton finally came into the movie. It just focussed on Meg Ryan being there for her father and her two sisters wheren't around to help. In the scences where the three sisters fight its perfect. It works because they are playing sisters and at the same time they love and hate each other at the same time. They all three have chemisty like real sisters do. There is no one in the world like them because you grow up with them and know everything about them. They are connected not only by their father but by their insanity too.
3,this call goes through!,"When I first finished watching Hanging Up, I really did like it. . From a personal family experience, there is usually that one person who gives their all and becomes this nervous worrier who tries to care for the sick person. And even though they may not enjoy it, they still are that special someone who forces themselves to visit their ill family member. And all this madness happenes between the whole family! lol I think many people can somewhat relate to this movie. I enjoyed this movie, but I didn't think it great. However, Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan, Lisa Kudrow deliver wonderful performances. And Walter Matthau gives a great last performance. It wouldn't be a waste of time to just sit down, relax and watch Hanging Up."
3,Could have been worse...,"Although the movie is a bit scattered in the first half,and Meg is too Meg Ryanish again for me, the movie focuses a bit more in the second to bring the story to a sensible, albeit predictable, conclusion. This movie is not really moving, nor especially accurate about the dementia process, but it does provide an emotional empathy outlet for those struggling with some of these issues."
2,Tries...but misses,"With this cast, I really anticipated this film to be interesting and funny. It made an attempt, but it failed. Most of the characters are self-absorbed. The story is weak. The only funny part is how the boy laughs--my son is going through that stage right now, too. However, that certainly is not enough on which to base a movie.The acting by some of the cast is good. It is a waste of the talent that was in the movie. As much as I would like to, I just can't recommend this movie."
3,Nice but needs to be simplified....,"I enjoyed portions of the book, however some of the language made it difficult to understand the subject matter. I had to have a dicitionary next to me everytime that I read the book. Its important to make theology accessible for those who are not biblical scholars to be able to understand. The portions about the love of GOd were simple and very impactful. I absolutely loved that portion of the book."
2,Fun but not sturdy,"My boys (ages 4 and 5 1/2 got this for Christmas last year. It really is a lot of fun, but the game constantly falls apart with regular play. It ended up being thrown out this spring as the balls were dented and lost and we couldn't deal with snapping it together anymore. Not worth the cost unfortunately."
5,Family Fun Game!,Our children had this game when they were younger and I bought each another game for Christmas to share with their families. Children as young as 3 or 4 can join in - and there are no batteries to worry about replacing! You can have fun without the worry of someone getting physically hurt - just hurt feelings when they lose.
4,Worth the money...,"I suggest you buy the paper back version of the book, i dont know that it's worth the extra money to get the hardcover. I found this book to be very entertaining and well written, tough i must confess there are some times when we get lost in the british way of talking. The only down side is that most of the book is based on the training they followed and not actual missions. The training aspect is enjoyable to read, but you cant get into it has much has when you know it's a true mission..."
2,Immediate Action,"There's no doubt that McNab has a story to tell. Unfortunately, he comes across as foul-mouthed (and I'm no prude - with 20 yrs in Brit/Canadian infantry units), self-centered, and only semi-literate, which is quite distracting.His editor should be strung up! There are more errors in that book (including type errors, horrible grammar, syntax, verb usage) you name it, than I care to remember.Reasonable story. Horrible read! There are far better books about the SAS out there; most notably, ""Soldier I, SAS""."
1,"Bogus Book: No info, poorly written, and no insight whatsoever","The top of the book states, ""The controversial book the British Government tried to supress!"" Let me be the 1st to say this is bunk. There is absolutely no information in this book that is controversial in any sense. In fact, any reader can get more information about SF, SAS, or any other force via the Freedom of Information Act.Also, this book is poorly written. It skips timelines, does not develop any characters (only mentions them), does not finish sequences, and has a plot so thin, it only has one side.Do yourself a favor. Save your money. Buy another book if you want to learn about the SAS or any other special force, or if you are hung on McNab, purchase Brave 2 Zero instead."
2,Errr...who are you and what have you done to Eric Clapton?,"Eric Clapton is my favorite musician. Period. So needless to say I always look forward to a new EC album. It seems, however, that after winning a million Grammys for Unplugged, Eric has forgotten how to rock. Don't get me wrong, I love some of Eric's acoustic work. Unfortunately this album sounds like something an artist puts out when they are contractually obligated to put out so many albums, and the record company is pestering you for something...and you just want to get them off of your back. Hopefully the recent reunion with Cream will inspire EC to return Back Home...to rock."
1,"painful, grocery store tunes","The lyrics might as well of come from a pleasant housewife shortly after digesting a particularly interesting issue of People magazine. This album is squarely for people who enjoy pasteurized reggae, Pat Boone soul and musak blues. The production is glossy, unbearably plastic impersonations of lively musicianship.In short, the album has no soul. This music is best enjoyed while chatting with your elderly aunts and uncles over crackers and cheap, imitation cheese.Avoid at all costs and enjoy your shopping experience."
1,Boring and flat,"Clapton's inspiration has been replaced by some new boring forgettable elevator songs.I'm sorry to say that REPTILE was a very good ""soft"" album for me ... This one not !I can't imagine CLapton playing these songs on stage... Hope the set of his 2006 tour won't be only based on this album... :(Maybe, this time, you should try a ""CREAM reissue"" show on DVD ;)"
3,Not that bad,"The bottom line is, if you're a Clapton fan buy the CD. If you don't like it sell it on e-bay or something. No, it's not his best but it is a decent effort. Artists evolve, the ones that don't are playing has-been shows at county fairs. Clapton is doing music, that I believe, is a reflection of where he is today. If you want ""Sunshine of Your Love"" or ""Layla"" then stagnate on your classic rock station. If you want to know where Clapton is now, give ""Back Home"" a listen."
4,"Can you say ""Back in the day""?","Like Van Morrison, many of us have a nostalgic connection to Eric Clapton dating back nearly forty years. We hope that each new record will catapault us back to the emotional sunshine of the 60's and 70's; a return to those days when the music was new and ground-breaking. It isn't to be because it can't be new anymore; but it can be refreshing. This the case with Back Home. Eric Clapton has gotten back to combining blues, reggae and R&B into catchy tunes that leave you satisfied. Perhaps not in a league with Journeyman, Back Home does enter that territory. Although Pilgrim was excellent musically it was a very difficult record to listen to because of its themes and therefore had a limited repeat-listening lifespan. Reptile lacked punch. The return to his catchy pop sensibilities is quite welcome. We probably won't experience the ""Oh Wow"" of a 461 Ocean Boulevard again but this is a fine reminder of how it used to be. This is a fun record and recommended"
2,whats the point,"before this album came out eric said he wanted to make a rock pop album. i thought he might have done something along the lines of his first solo album from 1970 that was one of his finest. this one is a pointless stinker, no inventive guitar playing or memorable songs. two stars because he is clapton but no more than that."
1,Weak,As a lifelong Eric Clapton fan I'm dissappointed in thie effort or should I say lack of effort. Eric must have owed the record company an album so he gave them this.ERic is at his best playing blues because that's were his heart is. Eric follow your heart.
2,Where is Eric ?,"I have to admit I almost completely stopped listening to E.C. about 30 years ago, there have been moments of excelence Me and Mr. Johnson, riding With King,Unplugged and Just One Night however after E.C. first solo cd things went downhill and have continued to slide ever since. Eric needs to play the blues to sound good not 461 Ocean Blvd. or the other nonsense he has recorded over the years. This cd is no exception it fits in with the majority of his past work. I used to think Clapton really appreciated the blues, if you want real blues go buy John Hammond or Charlie Musselwhite, John Lee Hooker etc. and as far as Clapton being the God of guitar open your ears to Sonny Landreth,Al DiMeola, John hammond, Ry Cooder,Jeff Beck and the list goes on and on. Sorry Eric glad I just listened to this and never bought it."
2,BACK HOME,"ERIC CLAPTON,WITH HIS USUAL FINE ENTOURAGE OF STUDIO MUSICIANS HAS GIVEN US A REAL ""MIXED BAG"" OF MATERIAL ON HIS LATEST RELEASE,""BACK HOME"".I FOUND IT VERY UNEVEN WITH CLAPTON SOUNDING LIKE HE IS LOST IN THIS MUSICAL MAZE....HAVING BEEN A FAN OF CLAPTON FROM THE START OF HIS CAREER,I ALWAYS GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT HIS COMFORT ZONE WAS AS A ""SESSION"" MUSICIAN,A ""MEMBER""....THIS RELEASE HAS SOME FINE MOMENTS BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS A MEDIOCRE EFFORT FROM AN OTHERWISE GREAT MUSICIAN AND HIS TALENTED CREW!"
2,Boring,"I give it two stars just because it's Clapton but this record is a cure for insomnia. In short, this album is one of Clapton's worst ever."
5,Deeply Written,"I thought that the poems by Ms. Jackson were expressed wonderfully. I lost myself in them from beginning to end. These are poems to be shared with the ""special someone"" in our lives. It reminds you of how wonderful love is and should be. Very well written and edited!"
5,Great album,I had forgotten how freaking good the drummer was but after hearing those tunes again it makes me want to go sit down at my drum set and practice.
2,Hooting Sirens,"First I must admit I forced myself to read this book because of all the lauding around. The story is a kind of written cartoon that I don't know how to consider. All is too simple, too black and white, too unbelievable... All protagonists are freaks. Paradoxically, the most human person may be the Tralfamadorian machine. So what can be made out of all those words? A fable, a satire, an allegory, or even a parable? All of these, none of those? I can only say the message KV intended to convey didn't touch me. Books by KV make me think of abstract works of art that many people enjoy contemplating. I just had a quick look and went away to gaze at more friendly artists."
3,It was just an OK,"I read to 70% of the book & put it down. I was bored & offended. I then remembered it was a satire. I picked it back up after a couple of days & finished it. I'm glad I did. It all came together & made sense. So if you start reading it, make sure you finish it!"
1,Too many Faux Interviews,"Although this movie tries to comprhend the compicated relationship between bully and victim it does not even come close. It come off as an over produced news drama show. Although this maybe a problem in you childs life, this video will not make it better, only worse"
3,Lacking features,"Just check your features before buying it. It does not have atomic time and no indoor temp. These are not complaints about the product, just warning you to make sure its what you want. Its dumbed down for a ""Professional Weather Station"""
5,Weather Station,Received the weather stations in the time stated. Very happy with the order and would deal with the company again.
2,Failed after a year,"The unit worked fine for about a year then the wind direction, speed and chill failed to register. rebooted several times, changed batteries, no effect. Avoid this product if you want something that lasts a while..."
2,Did not like the smell,"I was surprised at how many people here say they like the smell; I find the scent anoyingly sweet, not classy and it does linger on. It did nothing for my husband, who's as H---- as they come. Not as exiting as the famous Andron pheromone cologne by Jovan in the 80s. Wish they'd bring it back! My current fragrance is Givency's Organza edt."
4,Smells pretty good,"When I first put this on it was really strong smelling, but after a while, when the scent mellows on my skin it smells really nice. I like it."
1,Not received the item so far,"I received an email on 12/20/10 telling me that the item was posted but I did not receive the item. I contacted the seller on 01/07/11 and received an email stating a replacement has been posted but I did not receive that still (01/17/11). On 01/07/11 email said it would take 10 business days minimum, so I am waiting till this weekend to request for refund."
2,EST Teusday Wonderland,"Bought this after reading the reviews and listening to snippets on Amazon. Tried real hard to enjoy it but it's not enjoyable save a track or two. I listen to Hiromi, Eldar, Methany as well as a ton of other styles of instrumental music but this one just doesn't do it...for me anyway."
4,Wonderland forever for Esbjoern Svennson (1964 - 2008),"Tuesday Wonderland is today the last studio album of E.S.T. (there's a Live Double CD from Hamburg, recorded in 2006, released in 2007), the next one CD (Leucocyte) is on the way, but for the E.S.T. leader too late ... Esbjoern Svennson (44) tragicaly died last Month by diving ... In loving memory with the magical touches of heavenly piano ... with feeling, with rythm and energy .. Thank you for the Music, Esbjoern."
2,Ouch,"I sat there, watching it with my nieces, the is the only reason I purchase it. Originally I have it, but not on English audio, I couldn't believe my eyes, as I watch the first episode and the next and so on, all the way to the end of the series. What a chop up job they done, 2 to 5 mins have been cut off from each episode. This is what happen when they transfer Japanese audio to English audio, the chop up most scenes in order to fit with their translation. For any one who is a fan of manga, don't purchase it, for those who have never seen it or read the books, go for it. The quality audio and image are great if you have a big screen TV. P.S if you think that my nieces didn't notice the cuts, your wrong."
5,Great series,"Its based on chibi vampire. Was good and fun to watch it is a romance comedy. A great buy when price is low, can be pricy on other sights I got from import cds"
2,"Great, now where's the rest of it?","Extremely short on content, with a mere 159 pages. The sample questions are a joke. Often, it is impossible to know the answer from reading the previous chapter. No topic is covered with any depth whatsoever. I'm really left scratching my head and wondering why the author even bothered. At the end of each chapter the author suggests other books that you can read to gain greater insight. Save your self the aggravation, just get and read those books in the first place. Most of them are from the same publisher which, with this single exception, produces excellent books on Visual Foxpro. I recommend ""Effective Techniques..."" which will do more to help you pass the exams than this book."
2,not crazy about it,"The watch doesn't look like it on website's picture, the plastic case and band very light and look very cheap."
3,Oh come on guys (I'm not a kid by the way),"ok ok, i agree that ""Rotten Apple"" is no ""The Hunger For More."" We all know that Banks' first album was a classic and Rotten Apple will never be better than that. But come on, it's not as bad as u guys are saying it is. it's actually pretty good. Rotten Apple, Survivor, Playboy 2(not better than 1), Cake, Addicted, Hands Up, Iceman, and Gilmores are the best songs on the album but all of the other songs are good as well. i gave it 3.5 stars. great CD overall"
3,What happened to that boy ?,"Alright, so Lloyd Banks is the G-UNIT official NY lyricist, but NY rappers sophomore albums don't usually live up to the hype. Well, well, well, ain't no surprise here, the punch lines are here, $.50 is here, the sung hooks and the gansta mantra too.While all the G-UNIT kids will swallow the radio friendly worms (""Cake"", ""Hands Up"", ""Addicted""), Banks will have to do more before he can claim back his early NY-mixtapes circuit clout. There's a couple of tracks where Banks actually lives up to the fame (""Life"", ""Stranger"", ""Gilmore's""), however, the production ain't all that, a lot of tracks sound the same, a lot of them just feel recycled. 16 tracks, a couple of hot tracks, a couple of singles, do the math, that's a lot of fillers to skip through.It ain't like Banks fell off, but it's hard to listen to tracks like ""NY NY"", ""Iceman"" and not wonder where the hunger for more went and what could have been, 'life is full of possibilities ...'"
3,Decent,"this album has a few classics (Survival, Cake, ICEMAN) but those are the only high points of the album. there is a lot of filler on this album like ""One night stand"" and ""get clapped"" is just an awful song with Prodigy (Suprisingly). this is still a decent unit album and is worth buying used at a record store"
5,Almost the best it could be,"A great anthology including almost all of their hits and a selection of key works. However, the singles 'Never Ceases To Amaze Me' and 'Next Exit' are not included and need to be to make this volume complete. Surely a couple of songs might have been substituted with these two gems. A fabulous compendium overall, however."
5,Excellent and Practical,"I found this book to be well thought out, organized, quite thorough, but easy to read and understand. Covers everything you need to know about sailing - a very practical manual."
3,Missing tracks,"This was a very good CD. The only problem, is that about 10 songs from the movie are missing from the CD. and a few songs had the singer changed from the movie version, and it sounds trerible"
5,Great set!!,"I love this set of DVDs. There are about a dozen episodes that seem to have been realized on numerous collections, I myself have wound up with about three copies of each of these, but this set is all new and previously unavailable.My only wish is that it was longer. Eight hours seems to pass in seconds when watching this collection."
2,No Closed-Caption?,I was very disappointed to see that this DVD was not closed-captioned. Your Product Details stated that this DVD was closed-captioned and it was not. Being deaf this is very important to me.
2,Very disappointing,I expected a story along the lines of the original series or perhaps Crusade. This had the punch of a filler episode. I would rate this as the least of the B-5 stories.
2,"The lost tales weren't lost, they were forgotten!","The lost tales weren't lost, they were forgotten! I admired the Babylon 5 series because of the realistic entertaining plots about sociological issues among different species in space. This movie was realistic with the understanding that real day to day life can be anti-climatic and tedious. The stories have little plot, and have nothing to do with each other. The only thing that kept me watching was hope. I hoped there would be some dense plot(s) that would develop and make me want to care. Plot or purpose wasn't the only thing this movie lacked, it also needed more people. There were only 4 or 5 main characters throughout the entire movie.The best part was the ship battles special effects, and an appearance by a former Stargate regular. My opinion is you will thank yourself for borrowing the movie not buying it."
3,"Average fare, nothing special","My wife and I are both big B5 fans and have been since the first season. We have all the DVDs available and were really looking forward to new episodes. That said, we weren't exactly enthralled by the first segment on Lost Tales with Lockley on the station. For all JMS's statements about being an athiest, it was all God, demons, church, beliefs, etc.. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't up there with the episodes from the series either. The second segment with Galen was much more interesting, but again, not up there with the best episodes. The CGI was fantastic. The details on the ships and the station were outstanding. I freeze framed several times just to gaze at the details of the station.For a B5 fan, by all means, go for it. If this is your intro to the B5 universe, you'd be better off starting elsewhere."
3,Not impressed.,I was hoping for so much more. It was an OK story and any BAB5 fan should own it out of loyalty but...
2,Unfortunate Release,We expected so much more than was delivered by this DVD. Bablyon 5 as a collective series is a (the?) classic space opera. However this release does not give that tradition justice. Unfortunately too many corners were cut.
3,Read the negative reviews so you know what to expect,"You know how in some B5 episodes the main plotline is a talky, cerebral one, supplemented with a couple of sub-plots featuring more action? That's what these are, minus the subplots. The 2nd one is a little more ambitious, but still a little thin. So don't expect a regular B5 episode and you won't be disappointed."
2,So So,"This episode was just OK. I wasnt' really impressed with the story line. The special effects were great. But you could tell that the actors were all filmed on a soundstage. That part was a little disappointing. I would like to see more of the DVD releases, just pep up the storylines a little more."
4,"Great Stories, but alittle low budget","Typical B5 storyline from JMS. One of my problems is that I don't know where the stories line up with cannon. Also, it the production didn't have the same feeling as a normal B5 movie/show b/c (at least in my opinion) there were that many extras to give it that classic B5 feel of vibrance and hustle-and-bustle. Overall, both stories were interesting."
2,"$1.99 at iTunes, sure... $16 bucks, no way...","CGI = good, but limited.Actors = OK to good, some were a bit stiff, but none were painful.Storyline = weak at best, and the 1st part was totally outside the B5 'universe'I agree with the lead review, this really boils down to a (not very good) single episode. After watching, I kept going through the DVD thinking there had to be more to it than that. From what I'd heard, I was envisioning something more along the lines of Sin City, with several 'episodes' linked together with a common narrative. I liked B5 from the first episode, but this DVD feels like a blatant rip-off of that audience. It just isn't worth the money, and buying it will only encourage more of the same. If they do more episodes (especially if they are halfway decent), and release them all as a DVD, maybe that will be worth watching (and buying)."
1,"Dull, Boring and Disappointing","Sure the visuals are great - but this is another movie that proves special effects and good actors can't save a bad script. The writing was so poor and story lines so unimaginative, I can only hope that should they try to make any more of these, the producers go with a room full of monkeys and typewriters!"
1,Babylon 5 The lost tales,"To sum up The Lost Tales in a word LAME, I should have read the reviews before purchasing this."
2,Disappointing,Poor production values. The worst of JMS' self-indulgent wooden preachiness. Too much Scoggins.
3,was not impressed,"O.k., so B5 was a fabulous series.....no debate. The regular season shows had a mix of impeccable episodes and lower-end fillers. This particular DVD would be considered 2 lower-end filler episodes of the regular season. The stories were interesting to a certain extent but just lacked the overall awesomeness of the REALLY good single episodes. If I am going to pay premium price for the DVDs I really expect a bit more content. Maybe 3 episodes per disk would somewhat make it worth the price. If the others are like this I will elect not to add them to my collection. I would say rent it if you can find it(Comcast on demand has it too.) but this is not a buy."
1,Taints the original...,"Unless mine is the first negative review you are reading, you already have a good idea of the negatives: tedious, erratic acting, cheap sets, cheap cast, predictable, contrary to established canon, the pacing of a piece of decaying meat, well-duh flashbacks from a couple minutes previous, painful DVD extras.We literally had to have a family debate after watching the first section over whether we would even bother with the second. I won out using the argument that we just need to get the pain over with so the DVD can be shelved...forever.We are now rewatching the series for the upteenth time in an attempt to purify our memories of B5. I honestly do not know if we would even watch another installment of The Lost Tales were it free. It hurts."
4,Voices in the Dark,"I was pleasantly surprised after finishing this DVD. I didn't think I would end up liking it very much, but I found both stories to be very well done! The first one with Colonel Lochley was creepy and made my skin crawl, and the second with Sheridan was a very well done dilemma with nice references to some other cast members dropped in.This is a MUST to any one who has Babylon 5 in their video library, and I look forward to more Lost Tales."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I was expecting a more intense and involved story or stories on this DVD. I thought the story line was a bit tame compared to the intricate plots in the series. The special effects were wonderful, but it was overshadowed by the lack of detail in the plot in each story.Hopefully, the producers will begin a story on the Psy Corps and their war with the normal humans. Even a continue with the quest for a cure for the plague on the Earth the series Crusades was involved in. I thought that the series ended too soon without a conclusion."
1,Disappointed,"A big fan of the original series, but this is like 15 minutes series. Where is the rest?"
1,"Rent it first, then decide if you want to own it.",I was VERY disappointed in this DVD containing 2 extremely predictable and simplistic B5 pseudo-episodes. I would not buy it again myself.
4,A Welcome Though Short Return,"After several years of waiting they were back the heroes of Babylon 5.The excitement was at an all time high when I received the DVD. The Disappointment came when I realized that it was not a movie, just two episodes. But it was new episodes so it was worth a look.When watching the DVD I re-entered the Babylon 5 universe and quickly felt right at home with the characters. My only critique is that I still want more.It was a wonderful experience just too short."
2,Babylon 4.9,"I was really looking forward to this. Really. But as the Vulcans say (more or less), wanting something is often more satisfying than having it.This was not a Babylon 5 movie. It was a radio show with people walking around. It is obvious that they skimped on sets. It is obvious that they skimped on cast. Hardly any of any. It is two stories tied together by a common backstory. I won't give away either story except to say that the plots were frangible. Either could have been set in any other science fiction or non-genre ""universe."" Perhaps somebody with a home video set-up will take these and make YouTube versions set in the Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, or even Law & Order SVU universes.All the talk was boring. But it was nice to see Boxleitner and Scoggins again. I did miss Lando, G'Kar, and maybe Vir most of all."
3,Disappointingly Short,"Negatives:1) Only two major characters involved on screen, Sheridan and Galen (Lochley is in this too, but I never cared for her character).2) Minimal sets, a la ""300""3) Almost no Disc extrasPositives:1) Very thoughtful, well written scripts.2) Great performances by Bruce Boxleitner and Peter Woodward.3) Kudos to JMS for not being afraid to deal with the supernatural in a reverent, serious way that doesn't go out of its way to mock or disparage religious belief.Bottom line: Think of this as pay-per-view for two B+ TV episodes."
1,"Average, at best",Stedman's approach to motivating his readers is one all to common. I found this book only to be full of cliches - pointing out the obvious and reinforcing it like a nagging schoolteacher.The bottom line is that this book lacks creativity; it is completely unoriginal and provides no means of inspiration to those whom read it.
4,"""I didnt know HE could sing"".","For years it was virtually impossible to buy either this version or the 1965 version of Cinderella. I now own both of them on CD. I have always thought that it was too bad that there is no full length version of the original available, and was very happy when the CD came out. Julie Andews is,of course brilliant,and the idea of casting Edie Adams as much younger fairy Godmother a stroke of genius. The real suprise here is JonCypher as the Prince. I had forgotten how good a voice he had until an episode of Major Dad when he sang ""The Impossible Dream"". (He played Dr Carrasco on B'way). Its fun to compare the two productions. I wouldn't presume to say that one is better than the other. I really enjoyed being able to have the original"
4,Great idea worked out ok,"This book takes existing romance comics of yesteryear and changes only the texts. The original comics are extremely static and feature few props or decors to play with (much like cheap soap operas). This is good in one way, because it allows Martinet to focus on the dialogs, which are turned into fairly bizarre exchanges, but bad on the other, because she doesn't have much to work with.In the end, unusual as they are, most stories are still romances, if somewhat updated to this century. The result is funny but not laugh-out-loud hilarious."
2,OMG it sucked!,Sorry I paid $9.99 for this movie....should have rented it! I'll no to do my research next time.W Scott
2,Considering how stupid some of their plans are....,"The members of the Code Name Team seem to be as lucky as they are foolish. Lots of people get killed in this book, but the bullets always seem to miss the good guys. Neither the sex nor the gunfights in this book are likely to interest normal adults."
5,It's gorgeous!,"I'd buy it a hundred times again. Soft leather, not too thin, not too thick. Great shape."
4,ghostwriters,This is the orginial album of ghostwriters that Political Animal came from but its hard to find and has a lot of songs that are on political Animal. ONE good song is world is almost at peace and a few others I like this band they have a different type of aussie rock.
3,There are better books out there.,There are a number of books out there on PCOS which are chock full of useful information...this book was not one of them. I didn't find much here that wasn't already in a number of other books.
1,never got it,"yeah, never got it. did receive a refund, but no notification as to why it was never coming. so uhhh, guess it could've been worse."
2,Poorly done,"I am 66 and college grad. Definitely not my taste in movies. Flimsy plot, poor video quality and subtitles (characters speak English)in Spanish made for a choppy presentation. Do not waste your money. I trashed the DVD."
1,DO NOT ORDER!!!!!,"OMG! Do not order this! It's rated R... Not XXX!!!!That means its worthless!!!!!please, I wasted my money! Don't waste yours!!!"
1,"Pirates 2, Stagnetti's Revenge","This not the movie that the public expected, Because is CENSURED and not UNCENSORED. Why Amazon, don't put that in her review. I alert to the fans of Pirates 1, this is not what you expected is not a porn movie is only a pathetic drama of Jesse Jane and Evans Stone. If I want to see a pirates movie I better chose one of the Johny Deep saga of the Pirates of the Caribbean."
1,Pirates Crap!!!!,I heard an interview on the radio with jesse jane and she was talking about how hot and dirty this movie was so I ordered it. I am extremely pissed about this piece of junk I paid twenty something dollars for all the good stuff is edited out of it the whole thing isn't even worth being shown on late night cable. Who wants to sit down and watch a whole lotta horrible acting and put up with all the stuff they thought they were paying for isn't in it. I am not happy with this purchase at all.
3,A Case of the Country Cutes,"I bought this book on the strength of the title - and I still have to admit, it's a killer title. However, when I got to the point in the story where an angel was directing the plot, I almost put the book down and left it there. I should have. Shelby Kay is a terrific character. She doesn't need an angel to see her through the crises in her life. This is the first time I've read anything by Sarah Shankman and I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. But Sarah, honey, remember what they taught you in English 101 about ""deus ex machina""?????? There is no need to cheat the readers like this. Give us Shelby Kay without the insiped angel angle and we'll love you all the more."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this table and two chairs, along with two matching chairs under a separate stock number. Of the total of four chairs, three were fine. The forth had a factory misassembly. The parts could not be assembled as delivered. I had to remove the under-the-seat brace, drill new holes and reattach the under-seat brace to get the leg assembly to fit the chair properly and to properly align the predrilled screw holes in the leg assembly. The table assembled OK, but the top had a split in it. I had to repair the split, sand and refinish the table top prior to giving to my grandson. This table/chair combo is of very poor quality."
5,CUTE TABLE!!,"The finish is more of an reddish/orange-cherry than a actual-cherry...but it just so happens to match PERFECTLY with our entertainment center. The screws for the table legs were INCREDIBLY hard to get in. They are all stripped now, but I wasn't planning on taking it apart anyway. It is pretty tall for our 17 month old daughter (who is always off the chart for height), but I'm glad, because I didn't want a table she would outgrow in a month. Overall, it's a cute, solid, real wood table that is well worth the money. Just be careful while screwing in the legs!!"
2,Obvious defect on table top.,This was very disappointing. Paid a lot for what I thought would be a good quality child's table only to be very disappointed. There was an obvious defect in the wood that ran down top of table.I would not recommend this product.
2,"Damaged, bad stain, and red!","I ordered this set for my son as well as the 2 extra chairs. I opened it to find that there was not only a bad stain job on the table top, it was also cracked. There was a spot that didn't get stained as dark as the rest right in the center of the table. You would think that wouldn't pass Quality Control before they sent it out. Guessing the crack happened during shipping, there was hardly any padding in the box despite containing the table and 2 chairs. Also, the color is red, not anywhere near cherry or what is pictured. I'm not paying an additional $50 for espresso color and also they don't sell the extra chairs, so I'll have to live with it. I hope the replacement is better. Disappointing, as I was not able to have this in time for my son's birthday with the damage. Will update review after the replacement comes."
1,Going nuts trying to get the screws in!,"I was so happy when I received this table, but when I tried to put it together, it just drives me nuts!!! It's impossible to get the any of the screws to go all the way in. I tried rubbing soap on the screw threads and that almost get the last screw I tried to go in but it still got stuck (and the screw head was stripped so I can't drive it in any further)! I gave up and now I'm not sure how to return such a heavy table, after spending all these money. :[...]"
2,"Drop ""Eden Burning"" Into the Nearest Volcano","That's where this book belongs. As a long-time fan of Elizabeth Lowell, I eagerly await her new releases. I wish I had skipped this one; ""Eden Burning"" was a big disappointment. Chase Wilcox, professional vulcanologist, and Nicole Ballard, artist and dancer, meet on the island of Hawaii. Each has a tragic ""secret"" from the past that must be overcome before they can acknowledge their love. There is a great deal of drumming (Chase) and dancing to Tahitian music (Nicole aka Pele, goddess of fire) that is just too silly for words. The best parts are the descriptions of the island, the little bit that you get about its native population, and the fascinating material included on volcanoes. Ms. Lowell does her research. Save your money for the next book about the Donovan clan, or go back and buy one of Ms. Lowell's older works written as Ann Maxwell, such as ""Tell Me No Lies."""
5,Tacita's latest treasure,"This is a hilarious collection of photos Tacita picked up at German flea markets (Floh means ""flea"" in German), but it brings up some serious ideas. There is no text in the book except for the title on the cover. So without any text to put these pictures in context, the viewer is left to imagine the stories behind them. These are concrete records of existance, yet they don't mean anything to us looking at them. Because she includes photos of a similar nature yet completely unrelated to one another, these individual experiences show us universals we have in common. This is an excellent work loaded with intellectual implications; a true joy to look through."
4,The Truth About Witchcraft Today,This was my first book pertaining to magic. It was fascinating and opened my mind to explore more avenues of witchcraft. It dispells myths and rumors concerning witchcraft and offers historical information about the origins of the craft
5,A guide to one of the fastest growing religions in the world,"Scott Cunningham takes you through the basics of Wicca, one of the fastest growing religions today. I found this book to be very helpful in educating friends and family so that they would know that Wicca and Satanism are *not* the same! And in the mass market form I think that every Wiccan or Pagan should have a copy on hand to loan out to people. I actually have two out on loan at the moment and should probably get a third! This book does not detail every tradition (what book could?) but gives a good overview of what Wicca and the other Neo-pagan religions are all about"
2,need Windows XP Professional for this drive,"Great drive, but you need to have XP Pro in order to use it. You need to turn off Windows Simple File Sharing which can ONLY be done with XP Pro.Note that I called LaCie tech support and they were amazing and tried to help me the best they could. They even found out a work around to solve this issue but no satifacti=ory for most people."
2,tedious,"This book provides the tedious details of an event of minor importance in order to show the inner workings of the Ching system of administration. Though it illustrates some of the simmering nationalism that was to influence later attempts to end the Manchu rule, I was disappointed by overwhelming amount of tedious detail that breaks apart the narrative and makes the book as a whole slow-paced. Some interesting insights are presented, but it is definitely NOT a pleasure to read."
2,Dr. Otto,For a Jim Varny film I found this to be very slow and did not keep my attenzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
3,"OK For POCO Fans, but nothing special","I always felt that Poco lost its core when Richie Furay left. This album does nothing to dispel that notion. This is the last album with Timothy B. Schmidt (soon to hit paydirt with the Eagles) and George Grantham. Overall, this album sounds tired and uninspired.The singing and playing on this album is, as with all Poco albums,excellent. (Rusty Young's steel guitar is always a treat). The problem is that this batch of songs is just plain forgettable. Not a single memorable tune (and I relistened to this album before writing this). There is even an embarrassing stab at disco on the final cut, ""The Dance""...this was 1977 after all.If you really like the post-Richie Furay versions of Poco, I suppose this album is OK. I would recommend any of the Richie Furay led albums way ahead of this one."
2,Totally Pointless,"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read in my life!! It was so anticlimatic, which was even more disappointing since I had to force myself to the end hoping something would finally happen!! The author doesn't do a good job with the relationships surrounding the man character Hannah and therefore falls totally short to engross the reader to even care what ultimately ends up happening to her.It was a total waste of my time and my money."
2,"""I wanted to like it, but....""","I loved Ms. Sittenfeld's first novel, ""Prep,"" and I recommended it to everyone I know who reads. I wish I could say the same for ""Man of My Dreams,"" but no. In fact, I am just going to drop it into the book return bin at the public library as an anonymous donation.There is no doubt that this author is an extremely gifted writer, and that does come through in this book. Unfortunately, it still bored me into a coma. I forced myself to finish it, but my mind kept drifting as I considered putting it down and making a red velvet cake, which would have been so much more satisfying. I wanted more characterization and plot to chew on, but I was left grinding my teeth.Maybe Ms. Sittenfeld's publisher rushed her into a second book, or perhaps I expected too much after ""Prep."" Anyway, I do believe that she will give us more gems in the future. I'm not giving up on this writer."
2,Disappointing,"Was expecting much more from the author after Prep. Although not a complete waste of time, this book does little to endear us to the protagonist or say anything original about life."
4,A Group Called Smith - Italian Version tracks,"I saw the other reviews taking issue with the sound quality. I just listened to mine with headphones, and I certainly found no problem with the sound quality. I did find that the track listing on the back was incorrect. The songs are correct, but in the wrong order.My CD has:1. Let's Get Together [Same song as 'Get Together' by the Youngbloods]2. I Don't Believe (I Believe)3. Tell Him No [Same song as 'Tell Her No' by the Zombies]4. Who Do You Love5. Baby, It's You6. Last Time [Cover of the Rolling Stones' hit]7. I Just Wanna Make Love to You8. Mojaleskey Judge9. Let's Spend the Night Together [Another Stones hit]10. I'll Hold Out My Hand"
4,"Geography, History, and a Good Story","Maung Po is his father's third son. At the beginning of the book Burma is in a war, and Maung Po and his elephant have an important part to play.Maung Po learns many things, makes sacrifices, discovers new priorities as he matures, and learns what really matters before he returns to his village after the way.Very good story for children about 10-12"
4,B&B Help,"I bought as a gift for a friend, she found the book very helpful. It gave her many ideas on how to further her career."
4,Interesting story about interesting women.,"I've always been fascinated by life during the gilded age. The story of Consuelo , duchess of Marlborough and her mother is a fascinating picture of the that era. It shows in detail the customs and mores of a time gone by."
2,"Ok video, not a ""workout""","This video is just okay. Its only 45 minutes long, including 10ish minutes of warm-up. The audio and video quality is bad at times. It goes over a few kicks, two punching combinations, and then jumps right into the Poomsae. That review is pretty good and helpful. Overall though, the video wasn't really worth my time, and definitely isn't a ""workout"" video."
3,Too Much About Astoria,"Having lived in Astoria for over a decade I was interested in the title and purchased it. I had hoped for an exciting, insightful read. Instead, what I got was too many facts spread over too many pages. If you wanted a detailed history of Astoria, you would consider it to be very good. If you want a good read, you just might decide to pass up on this one."
1,Leo Buscalia audio cassette purchase,Product was described as new. Upon receipt the original packaging had been opened several times. Returned product for full refund. This was my first and last purchase from Amazon due to the deceptive advertising I encountered.
1,Wrong title,"After watching the no talent Knotts acting like a jerk(once again), this movie should be named ""GAS"", because that what it gave me after this so-called junk. My ten year old can do better with a 8mm camera. END"
4,I loved this game,"Yes, it had a few navigation problems, but to me they were not fatal, and the graphics were stunning. If, like me, you value beauty in your video games, you may end up enjoying this game. You may even find humor in some of the glitches. I know I did. But do save fairly frequently. I remember one glitch that trapped me and wouldn't let me go."
2,"some good graphics, that's it","there were some cool graphics here, but other than that, it was the worst game ever. i agree with one of the other reviewers when they said ""have the creaters of this game people ever played a game before?"" Put it this way- i had to use the walkthrough for every single move i made. i solved the puzzles on my own, and some i thoroughly enjoyed, but the puzzles alone were not worth it. if you do decide to get this game, find a walkthrough online immediately and just use it to guide you to the puzzles (if you are like me and just enjoy tough stand-alone puzzles). But if you want a good story line and good game play, this will be your worste nightmare. navigations is unbearable at times. i got stuck numerous times as well. had to go back to a saved spot. it crashed on my a couple times too, and i lost everything because i forgot to save. stay away from this one. seriously. the gameplay and story is horrible."
3,Not so Best Of Martika,"This cd is really badly done.Their is a glitch in Toy Soldiers,and the sound reproduction on other singles are not that great.Instead of putting unreleased tracks,and b -sides they lift tracks from the ill faited Martika's Kitchen.Since this is a ""Nice Price"" cd its well worth the price.If you have her debut their really is no need for this,exept for Love Thy Will Be Done."
3,World Book okay..,"When I first got this program, I noticed that the interface was very easy to use. Many of the articles were too brief, or you had to look harder for certain details than you would in other programs such as Encarta or Britannica. I noticed that the multimedia on World Book is not as abundant as the other programs, but it certainly was good. The pictures, sound, and video were clear and relevant to the articles. I would recommend this program for anybody under 15 or anybody looking for a broad number of topics, but if you need more specific information, I suggest you find another program."
3,"Okay, but not great","It cuts the bagels without me worrying if my kids will cut their fingers, but the bagels sometimes get stuck in the holder, especially if they're really fresh and the base cracked the first time we used it."
4,Does the job!,I first saw this thing at my grandmother's house and was amazed how easily it sliced through larger size bagels. I decided to get one for my dad as a gift; He loves it. Maybe someday I will break down and get one for myself.
1,Never slices the bagel evenly,"I've had mine for a few weeks and have probably cut at least a dozen bagels so far. This device *never* cuts the bagel evenly. Instead I end up with two ""halves"" where one end of the bagel is 1/2"" thick and the other end is about 1"" thick. This means the bagels will never toast evenly in the toaster. It does a good job of slicing but without being able to slice the bagel in half this product is basically worthless.The huge number of positive reviews that seem to never mention this fact lead me to believe that many of them are bogus."
5,It's exactly what the title says.,"This is a marvelous commentary and you'll never regret this purchase.If you are seeking deep scholarship, it's not here but you can tell it's present behind the scenes as Wright weaves the tapestries of each book before you. No effort is made to impress the reader with high sounding words - it's all about experiencing the story behind each letter. Wright is captivated by stories and this volume (and I trust the others of this series) are so inextricably story-based.In conclusion - nothing fancy; just a way of living within the book itself. My highest possible recommendation."
1,annoying,this machine looks great and hides anywhere - but dont make it too hard to reach -it turns off by itself after 5 minutes.i see no way to change this - it seems built -in - unless of course i have a lemon. maybe i'll sit on the phone for 3 weeks to find out -it just goes on then hums awhile then goes off - basically doing nothing to help my dusty desk.a waste of money
1,Stratocabbagius..........A listening extravaganzagus.,"Up until 2005, I had never heard of Stratovarius. After listening to Visions, I now know why. What is this album? I went back and listened again. I do feel that Visions is their best work up to date, including their newer releases. However, there best work is cabbage. I would describe Visions as video game soundtrack material where the game producers are trying to Mock the 1980's cheesy metal scene. It's hilarious, actually. The Track ""Forever Free"" made me laugh out loud.I think it's the vocals that turn this album into something I can't take seriously. Every time I hear that voice, I bust up. Total Cheese Whiz. Where's that hotdog?The most potential with Visions are the drums and the beats. The rhythms are quite good and really involve you.Statovarius? No.Next question."
3,Not as good as the original,"This game isn't bad, but if you're looking for a Pretyy Pretty Princess stick to the orignial version, unless your daughter is a hardcore Disney fan. The original has a better crown (and it matters to some girls) and a mirror on the box for them to admire themselves (where a cinderella decal appears on this jewlery box.) But I think the most glaring differences are that instead of the black ring being what makes you not win, this includes a cardboard clock set at midnight, which just doesn't match the fun of the ""Black Ring of Doom"" and that they switched out the Green Jewlery for the Yellow Jewlery. (The Green is much prettier, and it's in the original).Again, if you just want to play Pretty Pretty Princess, go for the original. If your daughter needs a Disney fix try to talk her in to the original, it really is a much better game."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Oh, how I dearly loved ""The Cape Ann."" How excitedly I ordered, ""The Empress of One"" knowing it was to be a sequel of sorts. Oh, how disappointed I am in this book.Lacking is the verve, the connection, the devotion to character believability. This book falls flat on all counts. Sally's mother is handled tritely in her mental illnes. Sally is a characture of a child, adolescent, and young woman. Her dubious responses to surreal experiences are achingly banal.This is heartbreaking. I know Faith Sullivan can do much better; I have rated her a five in previous reads. Perhaps this was an off book; a forced sequel she was coerced into completing. I will not judge her by this disappointing offering. Read ""The Cape Ann"" and visit her strength and her artistic beauty as a writer. Pass on this one."
5,I want the rest of the series!!,"This is such an excellent show. I absolutely love every episode. I am so happy to have the first 3 seasons on DVD. I want the final two seasons! I know, call me greedy..."
5,ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOUUUUUUUUU!!!!!,"Yeah, keep 'em coming! Can't wait to FINALLY get this in my hot little hands. Hope it sells well and they release the ENTIRE series. Thanks!!!"
3,Party of Five package review,"The item arrived in a decent amount of time. However, the box cover for the season was messed up quite a bit so I was a little displeased with that."
3,what's going on?,"a woman and a man plots to kill the husband in the triangle. but the body disappears. and there's a mysterious call. what is going on? they no longer know. as always, D has a sort of weird plot development. but it was fun to read from the sympathetic killers' point of view. one of his weakest accomplishments, but still agood read"
4,True fit,"I bought this for my Chevy Silverado and the fitment was true and material seems durable; So far they are working and performing as expected. Have no complaints. Since they haven't been on for more than a month, I can't rate on durability and long time performance. But As I said before I have no complaints so far and I'm very pleased with the product."
3,Good place to start,"My girlfriend, who is not jewish, was interested in learning more about the jewish religion and culture. I asked around and finally came up with this book. It was exactly what the rabbi ordered. Its a good mish mosh of yiddish, religous background, jewish kvetching and food recipes. Obviously, anyone who is looking to convert or just really investigate judaism, needs more then a book, but this is excellent for anyone who needs to learn the basics or is just trying to refresh thier memory. I read it myself, and relearned a few things I had forgotten."
4,Excellent guide for preaching through books,"I have not read the entire book book yet, but so far I am pleased. Bryson gives us a good example to follow for preaching a book series. The chapters line up in chronological order so that you have a step-by-step kind of guide as you work through the book. There are lots of books on expository preaching, but few on the special challenges of prepareing a series of sermons from one Bible book. I recommed it."
3,yes its ok,bought as a gift for a old friend and the fablous fabian was not much of a singer so how could you expect the cd to make him better however if you like the late 50s music its fine
3,"Decent enough, especially for the price","When I got the bass at first, it rattled like hell on the lower frets, but I fixed that by loosening the tress rod (something I'm afraid most buyers of this instrument won't understand how to do). The strings were pretty old by the time it got to me, but that is to be expected for a shipped bass. Aside from a few dings and imperfections in the body and an offset tuning peg, the craftsmanship was just fine. And it was suprisingly light too, lighter than my regular electric guitar even. For the money I payed for it, it is very playable considering the alternatives."
5,New freedom of movement for old dog,"Our 8 yr old long haired dachshund was isolating himself from family activities and growling when anyone approached him or when he jumped from the couch to the floor. Turns out he was in pain and another dachsie owner recommended OsteO-3. Within a week, the growling stopped and our introvert rejoined the family. No more growls - he thinks this supplement is a treat. We can enjoy longer walks too."
4,great product,Fast shipping...great product. Have been giving this to my 16 yr. old sheltie for 3 years. I believe it has helped maintain her mobility.
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices","Atomic Structure & the Periodic Table (2004) = The Periodic Table : PROPERTIES OF COMPOUNDS = Properties of compounds ---> all are One and the same, but the prices are Different"
4,"Just a really short review, barely.","Yep, got this one to, and as I said, this is gonna really be short.Chosen Survivor: Fine. I really think they should have stuck with the original plot--it was more interesting. Unlike everybody in the movie, I saw the 'brain doctor's' point...maybe it should have been tried like that.The Earth Dies Screaming. Pretty fine Science Fiction about the earth being invaded by robots. Fine idea...but only 64 minutes long. It's like I've always said...if you make a movie and it's crap (most are today) then keep it short! If you made a fine movie, add another thirty minutes to it (not fluff)! But who ever listens to Oldtechno?Anyway, if you like the old Science Fiction from the 40's,50's, this is your cup of tea. I like it!BYE!"
4,son diagnosed w autism/nonverbal,"well i must say this journey has been nothing easy but i would recommend this product considering that my son was able to name SOME of the flash cards like apple, ball, cat, dog, the fairly easy ones. He is 4 and has a very limited vocabulary so there are some pretty hard ones but i guess it gives him some to learn as he gets older. overall did this product help my son new words? YES can he identify pictures and relate them to everyday items? YES Reccomeend? YESgood luck and i wish you all the very best as i know we want the very best for our kids and only want to see them overcome this horrible diagnosis. god bless."
3,It Workd for This Non-Statistician,"This book was recommended to me by a colleague and mentor, Peggy, who adores quantifying and qualifying things. I'm not a numbers person; this is why I was picking her brain.My goal was to figure the ROI of my newest training program. I wanted to be sure that I could speak to the more analytical client intelligently. (These are the folks who really don't appreciate gut feelings - they want data!)I didn't need to read the book cover to cover. I was quickly inspired to create my first Sucess Case Method survey. [...]Good luck with this book. I think you'll find it readable and user friendly.[...]"
5,One of my favorite albums ever,"Everything works. The production is wonderful, the sequencing is brilliant, the melodies are sweet and beautiful, and it rocks when it needs to. Yes, it's music made by sensitive young men about being sensitive young men, and it will resonate most deeply with that audience, of which I am a part, but I can't see why any pop fan wouldn't admire this. Best of all, unlike most good pop, it's not pretentious, but heartfelt and sincere through and through."
1,Beating a Dead Horse,"This has all been done before... albeit much, much better. ""We Have The Facts And We're Voting Yes"" is the epitome of dull, lifeless, uninspired indie-rock. It sounds like Built To Spill stripped of any talent, soul, or personality. To listen to it brings to mind a roundish grey blob, sitting in an abandoned parking garage, emitting a high-ptiched squeal; the effect of which is similar to that of pushing a blunt iron rod through your sinuses and giving it a good crank or two. Bleh."
3,Oh Well,"I bought this album hoping that it would live up to the reviews given about it. Unfortunately, it didn't. It wasn't necessarily bad, in fact I like the first 3 or 4 songs alot but after that the songs begin to blend into each other. The lyrics are great(very indie/emo) but the melodies are exactly the same for every song, which obviously gets old pretty fast. Most songs are very slow as well. It sounds like he is singing into a tin can because of the major echo of his voice(probably an intentional special effect but not my cup of tea). I would only recommend this for the true emo/indie rock fans. This is not for those who lean toward the pop emo punk style. Those who like this may also like The Weakerthans or the Jealous Sound."
4,A great follow up,"Death Cab For Cutie will always be a band, I think, who release an album that takes a while to grow on me. When it finally does, I can't stop listening to it. This record's production is miles ahead of ""something about airplanes"". DCC has also dropped the beatlesque moments and optioned for a much more subdued approach. The result are songs ranging from modestlty upbeat, to the very downbeat. DCC does this wonderful thing where they make me keep thinking a song will eventually pick up, but it never happens! I like this. There may be influences, but the sound is really unique and satisfying.Comparisons to Built to Spill I've seen should warn listeners that they may love BTS, but this album may not have enough get-up-and-go for them. Still, this record had held my attention much longer than BTS's latest effort."
5,Amazing from start to finish,"Calm, chill, really funky sound to it, touching songs. I could listen to this album 1000x over from start to finish without getting sick of it. The BEST Death Cab for Cutie album by far, and one of the very few albums in my collection I can listen to from start to finish!"
5,"With just this book you can make classical looking baskets.,",I have never has so much useful instruction packed in a book with less than 50pages. Photography by Pat O'Hara and clear illustrations with arrows point out every movement. It may take a little time to make them smoothly and symmetric however even the first efforts look crafty and you just can not bring yourself to give them away as presents. Even if you do not have time to have fun with pine this is a must for your library and a good guide if you intend to buy others work.
2,They Sucked,"They began to dis-sew on the first wear .. also, they stank of cheap plastic, it was gross. They fit to large on my hands. So disappointing."
3,Works as asdvertised,This product appears to work as advertised...my one gripe about it is that you have to wait 4 hours after putting the tablets in the water before it is safe to drink.
1,Unrealistic,Just a pretty book to look at. How many people actually have lofty ceilings with space for a crystal chandelier or even room for a built-in bookcase in their bathroom? Give me a break. These were nothing more than fantasy bathrooms in a coffee table book.
5,This Music really enlightens the mind.,I dance Paneurhythmy and know many performances around the Globe.That is very valuable one.High level musicians are puoring their own inspiration in a devine harmony.Go on I.D.E.A.L. Society.
3,JVC Ipod adapter ok for the price,"This device works well, although I am a little disappointed in its lack of ability to provide a charge to the Ipod."
4,Awesome,"The adapter fit nicely behind my stereo head unit, it came with all the cables needed and was really easy to install. I now see the song titles from my ipod (installed in the glove box)and I can put my ipod on random play from the car stereo interface. One great thing is that if I am listening to a song and stop the car, the ipod stops at that point in the song so that if I grab the ipod and start listening it's right where I left off. One bad things is that the adapter / head unit don't seem to recognize podcasts. I had to reorganize my podcasts into play list so I could listen to them on the car stereo"
5,Great product,We were given this product when we were at the hospital. I strongly recommend it. our son gets bad diaper rashes when he is teething and this is the only creme we an use.
3,Gillette Wins,"I put my $4 almost empty bottle of Gillette Fusion HydroGel Ultra Sensitive shave gel up against this Italian super car equivalent of shave creams and Gillette won. I have really sensitive skin and if the planets are not aligned just right, I'll have razor burn for days. The GR cream worked well the first time I used it, but I kept getting more cuts and redness the more I used it. My skin was also very tight and dry for about an hour or so afterwards. I did not have my usual badger hair brush to really work the GR cream into a lather, so maybe using that process will make some difference. I normally turn my nose up at the mass produced overly advertised common brands, but I have to say that this particular Gillette gel is a top performer for sensitive skin and is a great value to match."
5,A GREAT PAGE TURNER,"Spiders and Flies is a gripping and thrilling ride into the psychological underbelly of desperation and desire. Vividly hallucinatory and lush, this book kept tight in its visceral web from the first page to the last."
5,Twisted but Good,"Got this book via the Kindle Buffett app and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the book. Its a little twisted and perverse in some ways and I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Ending was sad, but appropriate based on the rest of the book."
4,My Favorite Wives,"I was drawn to this book in the bookstore because the title said that it featured two of my favorite wives of Bluff King Hal, aka Henry VIII: Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. It tells their sad stories and is a pretty good book."
4,Buyer Beware - this is not the 2 CD re-issue version,"According to the Editorial review and some of the Customer reviews, I was led to believe this was the re-issued 2-CD verion. What I got was the original single CD version. ""Two for the Show"" was one of the greatest live albums of all time! I would like to give it 5 stars, but the audio quality of this CD is not that great, and 2 songs are omitted from the double album for space consideration. All that said, for $6.99 - I can't complain..."
3,Suprisingly Pleasing,"I usually go for much more German or British prog, esp. Canterbury scene (Gong, Matching Mole, Soft Machine), but as far as technical virtuosity goes, this is a damn good record. Solid vocals, great guitar playing, and relatively good sound (for a late 70s live record.) I just wonder how much was done in the studio, after the fact. Casual fans will take at least a passing interest, and this will not dissapoint completists.Standouts: ""Song For America"", ""Journey From Miriabronn"""
4,A GREAT LIVE ALBUM OF A GREAT AMERICAN BAND,"Kansas has been largely declared, by more than few scribes, as excessive, pompous, and self-indulgent. And Kansas did fall into that trap of musical excess that finally (for a little while) did them in. But there was a period, from the release of Masque to the magnificent Point of Know Return, where Kansas lived up to all their grand expectations. Two for the Show catches the band and their most stellar. I was surprised to hear, from this recording, that Kansas had a streak of improvisation in their performances. And that's good because it's during those moments of musical excess when Kansas' full fury is unleashed. It's a shame that there is not a DVD of the band in performance during this period, because it would have captured one of the best live performances of one of America's best bands."
3,Sure he's done it again - gone after the fast buck,"I can't think of an author in modern history that's tried to get every cent out of his fans. Publish a book. Rewrite it and publish it again. ""expand"" the storylines to add new, hollow, characters. Pile on book after book. I finally stopped purchasing all the books he writes, ghost writes, or stamps his name on. Enough is enough!"
3,"Good story, very ""hard military"" sci-fi","If you're into hard military sci-fi, then this is your book. The story revolves around Alicia DeVries, and really makes her a believable almost super-human character. Weber has created an richly drawn universe, and the reader will be drawn in immediately. It is non-stop action for 838 pages, and each military scenario is tense, exciting and heart pounding.I would have given this 4 stars, except the detailed military maneuver and strategy descriptions get redundant after the 3rd or 4th time. I love sci-fi, and can tolerate hard military sci-fi -- so this book overall is a very good read. It's clear that this is a combination of two (or even 3 books), so it was nice to read it all in one shot.If another book comes out in this series, I would check it out."
5,Fast-paced space war saga.,"David Weber's IN FURY BORN tells of Alicia, who often puts her life on the line to defend her Empire and its Emperor - until politics causes her to resign her duties and retire to a colony world with her family. When pirates attack and murder her family, her warrior spirit seeks revenge in this fast-paced space war saga."
1,Do not bother. Cannot hold the weight. Flimsy!,"This product is terrible. It cannot hold the weight of any microphone over 1 lb, and I would question that, based on your angle of use. It is terribly made with flimsy construction and I do not recommend its purchase. Look for a more sturdy built construction gooseneck mic holder. They are out there, it's just not this one. Fortunately Amazon was great about their return policy, which I appreciate. Thank you Amazon for at least having a positive return experience."
2,He has done better in the past,"I saw him do another stand up video where he talks about going into Harlem to visit his black girlfriend. That video was great, but this one was just average.I like it that he has an edgy style. But there are at least 2 times in this video where he sounds too angry or too annoyed.He definitely has the talent and creativity to be better and even be innovative. This video is not a good example of his talent."
5,Good Stuff,I knew Bill was a good comic from a couple of clips I had caught on comedy central. But after watching this special he is by far one of my most favorite comics. It's awesome to hear such brutally honest dialog. I'll definitely be purchasing his other dvd special.
2,Falls Apart Constantly,"My three-year-old boy loves pirates, so I was thrilled to get him this ship. Unfortunately, the ship took me a while to assemble, and comes apart instantly. The three pieces of the boat separate constantly, the rigging and railing pops right off, and the masts regularly fall over. There are a lot of small pieces, which are OK for him, but could be a problem for other young children. He still likes the boat, but playing with it requires a fair amount of adult assistance as it is constantly falling apart. I personally wouldn't even purchase it for an older child, but maybe you would be OK in the over seven-age group."
2,More appropriate for 6yrs & up...,"My son received the Imaginext ship for his 4th birthday. He's a dextrous little guy, but this ship does not stay together despite help from an adult. The ship and accessory components are packaged in sections and must be assembled. Much of the assembly was easy enough for a child to do but, the toy wasn't fun because the sections of ship so not stay together when playing with the ""finished"" item. The masts fall off, and the main peices of the ship separate when you don't want them to. My son was so discouraged he asked if we could return it for a toy that ""works right"". We bought Black Beard's Pirate Ship by Play Mobil and my son is very happy with that toy. He needed more adult help with the assembly, but it stayed together once it was assembled and now he's having lots of fun playing with it."
2,"Written for the academic world, not the business world","I'd advise that this one be avoided if you're looking for practical methods of actually managing design alliances. The entire book is really just an exhaustive definition of the concept of design alliances, with detailed descriptions of the various types that exist. No real practical information for the manager or executive looking for help with any one particular situation."
5,This is the BEST of the BEST,This is the BEST of the BEST. Dick St John lives on with these songs. Dee Dee is still around to recreate the memories.
3,..New Duo Now..,..Dick St. John died in 2002 after falling of his roof..and just like a woman..Dee Dee went out and got herself another Dick to keep the cash flow going..!
2,Sloppy editing an embarrassment for O'Reilly,"This book appears to have been thrown together overnight, without the attention of a proofreader or content editor. While I can't say it's actually missing important content, it is certainly the sloppiest O'Reilly book I've ever read. The very first example (on p. 6) is a glaringly ill-formed XML document (the second line contains spurious junk text, as if from a word-processing error), and it just continues from there. The book contains numerous apparent ""cut-and-paste"" errors of this kind, as well as evidence that global search-and-replace operations were hastily performed on the entire text without subsequent proofreading. What's up, O'Reilly?"
2,Too terse and academic,"This book tries to cover far too much in too little space, much of which is taken up by examples that are not that great and lack any type of highlighting, arrows, boxes, etc. that would help you quickly find the relevant pieces.Regardless of whether the author had a page limit or simply favors a terse and academic style, the net result was that I had to seek other sources to understand numerous points, and they universally explained the topic much more logically and in an easy to follow and, more importantly, read fashion.All in all a very painful read."
1,Lousy - A waste of time,"My daughter needed a book to read for school. Never having read Danielle Steel before I gave her the book to read thinking it had to be a good comedy, all of Danielle Steel's books are good (I hadn't read it yet). After completing the book my daughter said she wasn't interested in reading anymore of Danielle Steel. Confused by her comments, I read the book and agreed with my daughter. The book is ridiculous and shallow. Now that Daniell Steel has tried comedy, she should go back to what she's good at."
3,had a like-hate relationship with the book,"I felt sorry for her when she was dumped by her husband who loved someone else, but she came off as a bitter, bitchy woman overall who had no respect for her kids, who also had bad attitudes, and all she cared about was having great sex with a machine for heaven sakes! I also agree with one reviewer that the 13 year old girl should have been watching her little brother, who the hell needs a baby sitter at 13? Maybe the kids should have gone with the father, even though he was married to that pamela anderson like descriptive peacock, even she would have done a better job with the kids. Kind of stupid but if you're bored and want to have something to laugh at out of boredom, get this book out from whereever you'll find it collecting dust. My copy just disappeared, only god knows where it's gone."
1,Steel's worst ever!,"I am a Danielle Steel fan, therefore I just coudn t believe that she had written this lausy book!I am just sorry that I ever bought this book."
1,A total waste of time and money!!,"I have no idea how anyone can ever think of liking books by Danielle Steele. I've read two of her books so far and both of them were absolutely rubbish. This one was particularly disappointing. The title seemed intriguing to me, which was why I had bought the book in the first place. However the story is nothing like the title. In fact, after having read the whole book I found I did not even like the title anymore!! Such a deep negative impact! I do not recommend this book to ANYONE and I feel extremely sorry for the ones who've already read the book by mistake."
4,A Nice Change,"As a long-time fan of Steel's, I know that when I pick up any of her books I'll find love, heartbreak, and love once more. I will also find many places to visit while exploring the complexities of her characters. Never in my wildest imagination would I expect such a fun story from her. I sat and giggled into the late night. I also found a character that I, a mid-thirties mom, could relate to. My hat's off to Steel. Although far-fetched, it was quite an enjoyable story."
1,The Klone and I: A High-Tech Love Story,"This was truly the worst book I've ever read. The characters were unbelievable and the story line was absurd. The characters had bad attitudes and I wouldn't even want to know these people. I tried to get into the story line but couldn't draw myself into it because it was so insane. I was also disappointed in the writers repetition of rhetorical questions and inability to move on with the thought process.Just to give you a taste, there was a klone of a perfect mate that was made of wires etc. Steph has great sex with this klone as they do triple and quadruple flips throughout their sexual encounters. Steph thinks she has to make a choice between this wired klone and the real thing. I've read some of Danielle's good work but I can't believe they published this one."
1,"Too, shallow","I started out enjoying the suspense Steel offered with his earlier books, however the last three disappointed me."
1,WARNING: STAND CLEAR AT LEAST 100 YARDS AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!,"As a newly devoted Daniell Steel fan, I was very disappointed to read this book, which seemed to be written at a third grade level. The plot and characters were weak, and the idea of falling in love with a cloned robot was repulsive to me. The only reason I gave this book a one star was because it was the absolute lowest rating I could give."
1,"""The Klone"" really?",I first read this book a few years ago but I remember the plot and characters quite well. I wish very much that I didn't. It was boring and definitely uninspiring. It wasn't original and had no plot whatsoever and the characters had absolutely no depth. What in the world was Danielle thinking? I was just relieved that it was a very short book so I could finally be done with it.
1,Worst Book Ever,"Haven't read any of Danielle Steel's books in a long time because I was tired of the same old story over and over again. I decided to give her another try and picked this one up used. Waste of my $3.00, waste of my time spent reading it. Horrible story line, predictable main character again. Will never read another of her books."
1,Don't even waste YOUR TIME ON THE KLONE AND I,"I read the first short few chapters of this book hoping that it would grab my interest. No hope, I didn't finish the book; too boring."
1,a dissapointment,"After reading several novels the beloved author, I could not wait to start reading The Klone and I. I struggled to keep reading it.I kept on hoping and wishing it would get better, but it never did."
1,A boring and disappointing book.,What a disappointment! A boring story and uninteresting characters make you wonder how you managed to finish the book at all.
3,Entertaining,"I found this book to be different than Danielle Steele's other novels. It was fun, entertaining although I could have used a little less of the ""acrobat"" scenes and more focus on other stuff."
1,Pathetic waste of paper,"What was Danielle Steele thinking (or smoking) when she wrote this book? Her books are usually quite good, but this one is far from it. The concept of a ""klone"" in a romance novel is intriguing --- What possibilities it could have! (Too bad Ms. Steele couldn't think of any.) The writing was poor and the attempts at comedy lame beyond belief. Thank goodness I rented the book from the library and didn't waste my money."
1,Worst piece of writing I have ever read.,"First of all, her research was poor in certain areas. The drug Depakote is used for seizures and for Bipolar [Manic-Depressive] Disorder. What the psychiatrist in this poorly written novel should have ordered for the main character in this book was an anti-psychotic drug, not Depakote. Her grammar was poor, the story too loosely written, and her attempt at humor was sour. The only redeeming quality was that she didn't use her well-worn phrase 'huge blue eyes' at all in the book."
1,The WORST book I've ever read!,What a waste of time and money. Danielle....what were you thinking. I think everyone needs a refund.
1,This book was a real waste of money.,I don't know what has happened to Danielle Steele's writing. About the first two chapters of this book were good. Then it just got worse. Not very believable and gets pretty stupid. I really think I wasted my money on this one.
3,Escape reality for some far fetched fun!,"Being a divorced woman with two children, I really enjoyed this book. I have read most of Danielle Steele's books. The Klone and I was not a Danielle Steele book at all. It took me by surprise - that is what I really enjoyed about the book. It wasn't what I expected from Danielle Steele. It was a fantasy that at times I wish I could escape to. Easy and fun to read! Enjoy!"
3,A great addition to her long list of great novels...,I found this book to be soooo true to life. Things always seem to work out this way. I also think it was another great danielle steele book.
1,Unusual and Clumpy Story,I found this to be a little too far fetched and a little hard to believe. They way she normally writes you can see the whole setting and picture the characters easily. This was harder to imagine.
1,Spare Me this Hideous Story,Someone spare me! There isn't much to say about this book by my beloved Danielle Steel because I wouldn't even consider it a book. It's worse than those that she wrote for teenagers!
1,Weak attempt,"This novel started out well, but halfway through degenerated into cheap romance, cliched writing, and a plotline straight out of a soap opera. I found myself unable to care about any of the characters or what happened to them. Steel insisted on telling us, rather than showing, the important details, a device which greatly weakens any writing."
1,greatly disappointed,"I looked forward to reading The Klone and I, because I had so enjoyed Steels's previous novels. Part of the enticement to continue reading a book, however, is an identification with the characters. In this case, there wasn't any. There was none forthcoming. Instead, I kept on wishing they would use their native intelligence, rather than pure emotion (or in Steel's world, the scent or essence of emotion). I actually kept on reading just to see if they would come to their senses!! I was keenly disappointed, and in the end, their fates did not concern me. That is the ultimate failure of the novel."
1,A Big Waste of money,I have read every book Ms. Steel has written. I even took part of the grocery money this week to buy this book. What a waste of money and a waste of time to read it. I am surprised that Ms. Steel would even expect her readers to like this book.
2,A SENSELESS STORY,"THIS BOOK WAS A FAST READ AND VERY SILLY,SOMETHING YOU WOULD READ BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO."
1,Absolutely stupid,"I have been reading DS Books since I was a teen and this book didn't even seem like it was written by her. It feels like in the last 3-4 years DS has some sort of deadline to meet and a certian amount of books to write per year. This was like a fill-in book to keep you reading until she comes up with a good one. It was dumb, boring, and very predictable. Don't waste your time or money on this unless you need fire starter."
4,Erroneous review,"""Oddly enough O'Murchu ignores Alcoholics Anonymous which has had the greatest success by far in getting people to abstain from drink mainly by entering into a spiritual life much like the one he seems to be advocating."" [...] erroneously states this. On Page 195 of the 1998 printed version, it clearly states ... ""Practically every approach to the treatment of additions invokes, in one form or another, the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.). Central to this vision is an acknowledgment that we, individually, are no longer in contgrol, and that wae are not ultimately responsible fr what we are or do. We learn, often slowly and painfully, to accept a 'power' higher than ourselves, within whose love and energy we are not absorbed or consumed, but rediscover anew our true selves, as people born with the capacity to love and to be loved. It is in this rediscovery of love that we recapture something of our true nature. We come home to ourselves."""
3,A fair collection of hits,"Donna Fargo was no Loretta Lynn or Dolly Parton, but with deep sincerity she sang every song, even though her style could not save some pretty bad material. Donna's sincerity and sheer love of singing makes up for this flaw time and again. sampled here are her Dot and MCA years. Though Fargo's songwriting teetered on the edge of mawkish and hokie, she made them come alive. Few singer songwriters can accomplish this. This collection, while containing her biggest hits is rarely as satisfying as one would hope. The material is not balanced enough to be effectively anthologized. If nothing else, we get to hear a singer enjoying her craft. That makes this collection oft times fun."
1,Fst Fwrd to the last 8 min please.,"Hello World,I'm really starting to give up on anything new in horror. But who cares about me? Well, just a warning for wary wayside folk who havn't viewed this little piece of Uli Lomelish garbage! Wow everybody lets shoot sodium penethal(sp) and sit around in a circle contemplating what to do with this guy we tied up. To bad some a%$ kicker didnt find their invitation. Extremely unlikable characters kinda original story and about 2.5 mins. total of the ""murdering"". What a waste of my life. I coulda been cleaning pubic hair out of my shower drain. Good luck"
2,Neither Here Nor There,"This is a beautifully orchestrated CD. However, as a teacher to young children, I am disappointed. The song selection seems intended for children, but the arrangements and performance on most of the tracks are too sophisticated for a young child's ear. My advice for making a children's album: Keep it Simple. That's the reason why performers like Raffi ar so successful with their children's albums."
1,Beautiful tragic story,"WOW! This book knocked me out! I could not believe that this book was actully published. It is an outragious story. The main character June is such a tragic wispy little soul. Oh how I felt her pain, and rejoiced in her accomplishmnets. I am very happy to hear about the Mini Series on Fox. I am planing to see Ms. Gavin on her many stops as the tours the country with her wondefully horrible book. Good Luck on your next book Betrayed II back from the past."
2,"end of game is slow, requires disc","you will need to have the disc to start this game. a bummer when you're on a laptop on the road and you just want to play a video game. most people don't carry around the cds that come with their software anymore. it also doesn't stop people from copying games illegally or cracking them to use without discs (do a google search).that said, the game play is good, the graphics are nice, but the end game gets to be pretty slow moving. i have a fairly recent macbook pro and this game gets really sluggish as there are more units and map revealed. kind of sad since that's when it gets more interesting.buy world of warcraft instead. this game is a poor port to the mac platform."
1,A Misfire,"Stripped to its basics, this novel amounts to little more than a series of concocted images of the macabre--all, I assume, to build a menacing atmosphere in an otherwise common-place story of an unhappy marriage. The effect, sadly, is the opposite. Rather than shudder at each pointed reference to blood, pus, feces, scabs, roadkill,and prosthetic limbs, the sheer redundancy of these images became an irritating distraction and prompted me to abandon the book halfway. Where, I wondered, were the editor's red pens, good sense, and bottles of white-out?..."
1,Depressing and inaccurate,"I grew up in Pueblo and was a teenager during the 1930's. I bought this book with the great expectation that wonderful memories from my growing up years would send me down nostalgia lane. There was abosolutely no similarity to the Pueblo I know and remember in the novel.With the exception of a few familiar names like Gast the characters were far different from the people I knew well. The Gast's were neighbors of mine. They were well respected in the community and beloved by all who knew them. Julavits depicts Pueblo as being in the dust bowl. In the 55 years that I lived there, I do not recall one single dust storm as she described. I guess if you are going to write fiction, you may as well make everything up.The story itself was difficult to follow because her style of dreamy surreality was boring. The plot was weak and the storyline odd and very depressing. Sorry Miss Julavits, your first attempt was a stinker."
5,Excellent,"This is the greatest Latin reader ever written. It includes every single important work ever written in latin, including poetry."
3,Out of Date,The book is well written and very cheap but you get what you pay for. If you are using an older version of Flash it's fine but for Adobe CS4-CS5 you'll want a newer book.
5,Healing!,This book is a must if you want to have in yours hands the dreamed fairies from chilhood books... The best is that the fairies will come from your work. Salley Mavor is generous sharing her dreams and making them reality for more people.
5,Wow!!,"This album has such a sophisticated sound and it's very creative. I haven't heard a fusion of music like this before. Truly East meets West. I love all the tracks. If you have the chance, make sure you listen to the Reinterpretations album. They've re-recorded a bunch of tracks from the CD."
2,Sinus Relief,"Some minor relief after 3-4 days of taking 2 tablets , 3 times per day.I would not recommend this product. Even though it is much more expensive, Clariton D is more effective."
3,Not a bad transition,"This album is a bit spotty in places and I don't like it as much as any of their 80's albums, but it does have several songs that make it worth buying for the casual listener as well as for the hardcore fans. ""Early Morning"" and ""I Call Your Name"", both of which appeared on their greatest hits collection, are great to start with and get things rolling. ""Sycamore Leaves"" and ""Cold River"" both provide hard-driving, pulse-raising beats that are outstanding, more powerful than any of their previous works. And ""Waiting For Her"" serves as the enchanting, beautiful ballad. My personal favorite on this release. Unfortunately, the last few songs don't really add anything and only cause this album to drone on for a little longer than it has to. Still, if you don't mind buying an album that still has at least fifty percent good songs, then I'd recommend this."
4,A new direction for ex-teenie stars,"""East of.."" is a great leap forward from the slick synth pop of their previous albums. Some German magazines claimed that a-ha have become ""too serious"", but this is by far their most interesting and diverse effort. They tuned down the keyboards and invited a real backing band in order to create a more organic and rock-oriented sound. The signature hit of this album was ""Crying in the rain"", a mighty and painful ballad, but the other songs are equally fine. ""Early morning"" with its slide guitar and the up-tempo rhythm is one of their best songs. The psychedelic ""Sycamore leaves"" and ""Cold river"" rock harder than anything the band has ever done. Sometimes Morten's singing is a bit overdone, but the musical performance is flawless. Unfortunately, a-ha's fall was quick in the '90s, as they've only released the lackluster ""Memorial beach"". However, ""East of.."" remains their most ambitious and artistically important album."
3,Too much of a change of sound.,"This is the first A-ha CD I only give 3 stars. The album was so acoustic and synthless I actually thought they had replaced the keyboard player at first! One of the things I look for when buying Cd's or getting into bands is looking for new sounds, unique sounds, good use of technology, I don't like bands that use 30 year old technology. This is a technology age no matter how many garage bands you hear on the radio today. To be scared of keyboards is to go backwards in progress. On this album it's mostly piano. ""Early morning"" is as good a song as they ever recorded. The songs are still good and well worth listening too but the whole album is a bit slow and sounds '40 something'. No real danceable tracks. Sunday afternoon music or something."
4,Back to the top,"It appears as though A-ha is a band that will keep surprising. It sounds like they are a band, now more than ever with the addition of a regular bassist and drummer. Not only that, the songs are smooth and very rootsy. This could almost be labeled the A-ha ""acoustic album"". It opens with a haunting rendition of Carole King's ""Crying In The Rain"" and if that isn't all, it winds up being a 1-2 punch with ""Early Morning"" right after, which plays like one of those European spy movies. To add to the surprise of such a band-oriented sound, Morten hands over lead vocals to Magne ""Mags"" Furuholmen for ""The Way We Talk"". The only criticism I have for this album is the overuse of the thunderstorm sounds. High points: ""Early Morning"", ""Slender Frame"", ""Waiting For Her"", ""(Seemingly) Nonstop July""."
5,Very Necessary,"If you own a BR 1600, this is an absolute must have item. I can't stress this enough."
3,extremely well crafted,"Overall, this movie delivers exactly where it's said to deliver- the action- the fight scenes are extremely well crafted, although not entirely realistic, the stunts are so over the top and extreme, that you don't care about the unrealistic action in the movie, and only watches the amazing scenes in front of you!Finally, the music is actually quite good- The songs Titliyan Titliyan and Jazzy B's Chuk de Punjabi will be stuck in your head days after you see this movie. I highly recommend this movie!!"
4,house of traps,"I LIKE KUO CHE THE LIZARD FROM THE VENOMS.GOOD MARTIAL ARTS,AND A GOOD LEAD.THIS MOVIE IS VERY RARE FROM SHAW BROTHERS.THIS MOVIE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR A MONA FONG PRODUCTION.LO MANG THE TOAD IS NOT FEATURED OR ALEXANDER FU SHENG.I WENT TO THE MOVIES TO SEE THIS IN MANHATTAN ON HESTER ST.AT THE MUSICAL PALACE.BUY IT."
2,Masters of All That They Surveyed,"An interesting, well researched book about Robert Schomburgk's attempts to obtain a place for himself in history within the context of setting forth British Guiana's borders using the science and land surveying techniques available to him in the 19th century. The prose of book, however, is what native Guyanese would call 'high falautin' and, toward the end, I disagree with a few of his political theories on modern Guyanese politics; moreover, significantly, there is some repetition. In the end, Graham adds a human and scientific aspect to the discourse concerning the disputed boundaries. The editors should have allowed for a rewrite and/or the author should not have rushed to market or allowed for more maturity. I would recommend the paperback."
1,total waste of time,"This book was a total waste of time. Full of high-blown, flowery prose, lofty hypotheses, and absolute nonsense. Sometimes a Ph.D thesis--which this apparently was before the University of Chicago Press was convinced to publish it--ought to remain a Ph.D. thesis. A waste of trees, a waste of ink, and a waste of time. Save your money and read the yellow pages--you will enjoy it more than Masters of All They Surveyed"
2,A must read for all ages!,Everyone should read this book. It is the most inspiring thing ever written. Ms. Shin explains how to get the things you want in life with positive thinking and behaviors. Think it...and it will happen. Ms. Shin believes that good things happen to those who believe in the power of positive thinking. She teaches that fear is the great crippler. Fear is the roadblock to all things good. It is timeless advice for anyone looking for ways to improve their lives.
3,"A better title would be ""Jefferson: His Public Life""","I've been reading biographies of the presidents in the order they served, and I have to agree with Andrew Wagner's review: I don't really feel like I know Jefferson after reading this biography. Unlike McCullough's ""John Adams"" or Ketcham's ""James Madison: A Biography,"" this book deals predominantly (just shy of exclusively) with Jefferson's public life. The author seems to begrudgingly deal with Jefferson's personal life only because some exposition of it is expected at certain points (e.g., formative years, Sally Hemings). He barely mentions Jefferson's friendships with Adams, Madison, and others. You'll know more about Jefferson's personal life from reading McCullough's book on Adams than reading this biography. That said, if you're, in fact, looking for a good synopsis of Jefferson's public life only, this book does a good job."
4,A Cry In The Night,I ordered this book to read for my abnormal psychology class. I picked it because I wanted to learn more about Multiple Personality Disorder. The book was sad and some points and made me want to cry. It was very imformative on the disease and it helped me to understand it a little better. Overall the book was really good and I would recommend it to other to read.
3,"An overlooked slab of prime, home-cooked independent rock","The fact that this Wharton Tiers-mixed release is not widely known is hardly the fault of the music. Anyone who has heard the remarkable, hypnotic and evocative ""Trip"" is likely willing to shell out for this record without further ado. The challenge is then FINDING a copy, which thanks to the inscrutable distribution philosophy of Caroline and its subsidiary labels is no easy feat. At least Amazon seem to be up to the task! Although none of the songs on this album surpass ""Trip"", there are a number of strikingly-textured winners, and this Ohio-based duo -Alex and Manish- show considerable range and ingenuity as songwriter cum multi-instrumentalist, and guitarist, respectively. The band sounds very ""young"" on this rough-edged debut, especially as concerns vocals, but just as this album shows a good deal of promise, it is also enjoyable in its own right, and improves with every listen."
3,3 1/2 stars,"I don't know what it was about this story that made me not love it. It was a good plot, good characters...I just can't put my finger on it. I should have liked it, but I didn't really. Perhaps the romance went too slowly. Actually the whole story went a bit slow. I felt like I was skipping over pages too much. Greer was a tad naive, yes. Though Rhoderick was not always that nice. He was too blunt at times. But other than these, I would have rated it a 4. But I just couldn't...get into it. The interest I had when I read Ava's story wasn't there. If you like slow romances, then this could be the book for you."
5,No End In Sight (DVD) is excellent viewing/great interviews,Great DVD for an excellent perpective on the Iraq war without media bias. The interviews are very telling and insightful.
5,Truly Outstanding,"A fantastic documentary outlining how we got from the fall of Saddam's Statue shown on CNN to the bloody mess that exists there today. I won't give a long review as there's plenty of others out there but it's entertaining, enraging, saddening though ultimately enlightening. And it's very clear where the fingers are pointing..."
5,Finally a real news story,"Finally somebody gave us some truth about what happened, this documentary gives us the news the mainstream media failed to give us about the war in Iraq and how the Bush administration failed us."
5,Wore it out,In 1991 in high school I would routinely listen to the whole album........all the tracks are powerful
1,Amateurish editing,"I bought this CD because I couldn't find a release of Alpert's album 'Rise' on CD. Well, the songs from the original Rise album are not the original versions. The song 'Rise' is cut down with about a minute, and the bad thing is you can hear where the cut was made, it's not done very well. Then for no seemingly logic reason at all the song 'Rotation' is faded in the end. I don't know why on earth they did that, only to save about 30 seconds from the original running time??? I was very irritated from this. Then the three last songs are really just crap. 'This guy's in love with you' is a very nice tune though. But I'd rather buy a dedicated Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass best-of-CD instead of this, and then I WANT A RE-RELEASE OF THE ORIGINAL RISE ALBUM ON CD...PLEASE! It seems to have gone out of print, which is understandable but no excuse for not printing up more copies. Also the price of this cd is ridiculously high and not justified. Sorry but I simply cannot recommend it."
4,Excellent,"Perfect product, it`s beyond my expectations. I highly recommend it for everybody, you are going to love it, no problems to report."
5,Ram Mono Vinyl Lp Is a Great Addition To Any Record Collection!,Loved this album as a kid and never knew this was produced for AM radio when it was first introduced to the world. I really enjoy the presentation of this mix through my vintage Pioneer HPM-60 speakers at higher volume levels. The subtle but noticable differences in some of the cuts compared to the stereo version was an added bonus for this true McCartney collectable. I recommend this to any and everyone who enjoys this great Lp and loves a choice collectable to boot. This one will be a collectors prize in the coming years for sure.
1,Price Gouging!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS A RIDICULOUS PRICE!!! HERE IN OHIO THIS PRODUCT RETAILS AT $18.99 FOR A BOTTLE OF 50 TABLETS! THIS IS A RIP OFF AND I WILL NEVER PAY THIS MUCH FOR A BUNCH OF THIEVES!
3,not as pictured,"As everyone can see by the picture, the bottle is MINT flavored, which is why I skipped past the numerous other thumbnails this seller advertised to order this bottle. like those, Still 'Berry'. No response when message left. 3 stars anyhow cuz of great price."
4,Easy Install + Savings,"After years of expense and frustration with various faucet mounted filters I decided it was time for a change. This filter kit was way easy to install and the thing was working in less than an hour. Consider how much you spend on those other filters and what a pain those leaky faucet end filters are. Do this, you'll be glad you did."
4,An indispensible guide for today's Christian,"Wright's prose here is accessible, deceptively simple, and effective in delivering the age-old brand new story of Romans to a modern audience. The narrative of Pauline theology gets a fresh breath from under the clutter of excesses seen throughout Christian literature. Though not straying too far from the tree, Wright does shake things up. For those looking for a faithful, and yet disarming, take on Romans you need look no further."
3,OK except Awakening from Stand by,"Installed on Dell Inspiron E1705 notebook computer. Works fine with external hard drives, DVD burner, Video capture. Will work with Logitech wireless keyboard+mouse, but causes problems if you use Stand-by feature with computer. Attempting to awaken computer out of Stand-by will not activate display (stays black) and disk seems to do some strange, repetitive activity. Plug Logitech directly into notebook and all other devices through Hub works OK with Stand-by. I have found other problems with Stand-by, so problem may be of Microsoft's making."
3,Skinny Bones,"I gave this book a three because it is a good book and very funny. This book is about a boy named Alex playing baseball. Everytime Alex goes to school or Little League a kid named T.J always wants trouble with Alex. I enjoyed reading the book, but, baseball is not really my sport, That's why I gave this book a three. If baseball was my sport I would give it a better rating like a four. ...."
5,"Please,can I read this book for the 9,999th time?","Very funny and I almost burst out laughing just remembering something funny in Skinnybones. I think that if you like Barbara Park's Junie B. Jones and you would like something one level more advanced, then I think you should read this book. It is for people who like books that might make you fall off the bed if you read it in bed because you laugh too hard."
4,Signs of greatness to come,"This is probably the most ""Elvis Costello-ish"" of Butch's records. It doesn't reach the heights of The Hey Album or Readysexgo, but it's good, fast and poppy. Definitely worth it to hear the evolution of Butch."
1,Not plaid,"You are showing, at least in a 46 reg., a picture of a plaid coat and the only choices are herring bone. There is a big difference. This is very misleading. Jos. A. Bank Web site is doing the same thing. Needs to be fixed."
4,THE CD THAT STARTED IT ALL !!!!,"Sorry I'm late everyone but I just started getting into writing reviews. This is literally the cd that started it all for me. This is the first trance cd I've ever heard. Since then (1997) I've been hooked. Back in the late 80s-early 90s my mother introduced me to dance music that she brought back to America from Germany (long story). So that kinda got me into the whole genre. I owe so much to this cd though. It paved the way for all of my major trance purchases, like tunnel trance forces, DJ Networx, Trance Mix USAs, Trance Allstars, and other Dream Dances alike!!!"
2,Quart bottle of sorgham,"I am disappointed with the sorgham from Barry Farms! It has very little sorgham flavor to it. In fact, my daughter said that it tastes more like syrup that you would buy at the grocery store and I tend to agree. Sorgham has a dark brown color and you can't see through it even when you only have a teaspoon full of it. The Barry Farm product is clear enough that you can see through it when you pour it into a pint bottle....Won't be buying any more....M. RobertsLoveland, Co"
3,"It's OK, at best","The sorghum syrup arrived promptly, and was also well-packaged. The flavor, however, was far from what I had in mind. My last sample of sorghum was from a farm in Mississippi. But they don't ship. Anywhere. Cash and carry at the mill. Too far from here. This didn't have the texture and appearance I was expecting; it was pale and cloudy and certainly didn't have the flavor. It's hard to taste a product over the internet! But when you pour it over a fresh biscuit, it's flavor improves greatly!"
1,Food review,It is very mild and a bit disappointing from the sorghums that I remember from years past. I will not purchase this brand again.
2,House of the rising sun,"It was an ok movie but I'm not use to seeing Bautista get his but kicked like he is nothing. I expected more of an action role, and this was more like a drama suspense type movie"
3,not so rising,"This film has actors that portrait well but their actions are weak. It could have been much better, but its a flesh film at best. If Ray is built like a hulk then use those abilities outside of body shots."
2,Fame Over Acting.... Again,"I'm not going to lie, I only rented this movie because I was curious about Batista's acting skills. And this is the reason it's getting 2/5 stars.As far as the storyline goes, it's a pretty typical 'seek and revenge' setting. Movies like this seem to never get old to me though so that was fine. The only thing that completely killed it for me was Batista's acting, he could not get away from his bad-boy wrestling act the ENTIRE movie which is fine for 5 minutes in the ring but dragging it out for an hour and a half was dreadful. He was dull, emotionless, ""too cool for school"", and looked like he was staring at a wall in his dialogue - it never changed not once and it got old.If they would've gone with a different actor for the main character this movie would've had great potential, but they didn't so *insert fart noise here*."
1,Not what you think,"I received this today and instead of what is pictured I received a green rock and a yellow rock. They were not multi color like the picture and there is only one per order, not 3 like pictured. Also it states on the front of the package that it is ""the rock floats"" yet on the back in small print it reads ""use caution near water--this product sinks like a rock!"" Also it states on amazon for romping and chomping but also in the small print it states "" the Rock is NOT a chew toy. Excessive chewing may damage the product"". So I am confused what is this for? Well we also took them out and played fetch. They each lasted around 3 throws before they decided to bust down one of the seams."
3,Blasphemy is in the Heart of the Beholder,"I finally got around to seeing Heart of the Beholder.The movie was very engaging. It follows Mike and Diane Howard from before the birth of their first child. Their hopes for a better life are realized when Mike's gamble of opening a video store blossoms into a popular video store chain.That's where the problems begin. A local religious splinter group targets the Howard's video store chain for offering blasphemous videos such as Tom Hanks' ""Splash"".When Mike refuses to cave to their demands, their leader blackmails the DA into creating charges against them. There are death threats against his little girl, and things get just plain ugly.Justice prevails, but it was too late. The weight of the legal expenses crushes the Howard's dreams.I don't want to spoil it for you, but how the Howards get revenge is hilarious. Check it out!"
2,Marginal,"While the book has some interesting ideas in it, I was appalled at a handful of them, such as #59 (putting an Alka Seltzer in a woman's vagina) and #104 (geting head while driving a car). I would never place a carbonated item inside a woman's vagina, nor would I want to be receiving oral sex while trying to drive! Ideas like these, despite the author's claims to the contrary are plain dangerous.The comment on one trick that ""large-breasted women are more sexually experienced than smaller breasted women"" also bothered me. Does the author or the person who came up with that trick know this from personal experience? I certainly haven't found this to be true in my own experiences.If you're looking for ways to spice up your sex life, there are numerous other books out there to read, like the Sex Toy Tricks series by Jay Wiseman, Bondage On A Budget, or even the Sex for Dummies book.I'll pass on this one, thank you."
5,"Comprehensive, mind-expanding!!!","After reading the first reviewer, I beg to differ with that person's viewpoint. ESO is a great book that has never enjoyed much critical acclaim and this book talks about techniques from it and recommends it in their very GOOD reading List in the back! I think the reading list alone would make the cost of the book reasonable! In this age of Sex for Dummies and such, it is good to know that an old and trusted friend, confidante, counselour, and even tittilator like Playboy would come up with a tasty buffet of ideas,tips, tricks, skills, techniques, and just fun stuff on the issue of love and sex! Sometimes you just have to go with your instincts and keep an open mind! They also give kudos to the Good Ladies at Good Vibrations! I wonder if the reviewer ever tried any of the suggestions? This is a keeper of a book! -ed saunders-"
3,Oil Pan gasket,Ordered this gasket and it simply doesn't fit correctly. I have a 2005 KIA Spectra5 auto. 2.0l. All but 2 of the holes line up. If looking at the picture it would be the two most right holes. The holes are offset just a bit and more to the inside. I cut out new holes and used some gasket seal to fill in the gap of the old holes and make a proper seal.
5,A great movie to lift your spirits and make you laugh.,I was so excited that this movie came out in DVD. I had worn out a copy I taped off of the TV airing of the movie many years ago. I watch this movie to get in the proper Christmas mood but it is fun to watch at any time of year. Tim Conway is great in this film and I smile just thinking about his role as a burnt out mail carrier. If you need a little levity in you life this is a great film to lift your spirits.
4,Good Triumphs,"Entertaining, enjoyable feel-good story. I liked it so well that I bought one for most of our family and one for us to keep."
5,Dear God,"Wonderful DVD, very realistic, great acting and very close to believeable as far as the Postal System is concerned. Again great acting."
3,"Okay, nothing to write home about.","This movie had a few laughs and a few touching moments. I like Greg Kinnear a lot and he's the reason I picked up this film. It's good for an enjoyable evening, but don't go in expecting Academy Award winning material."
4,Woof!,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- Given the popularity of Clifford the Big Red Dog among very young children with library cards, it was almost inevitable that the series would be transformed into an animated television program at some point. Clifford the Big Red Dog ran on PBS between 2000-2003, featuring the voice of John Ritter as the title character. Each airing of the show featured two 11-to-12-minute segments, five of which have been repackaged on this disc as Clifford the Big Red Dog: Dog Days of Summer.The DVD transfer is hit-and-miss: colors are vibrant and close-ups look terrific, but any long shots or complicated bits of animation look pretty rough and reveal the show's skimpy budget. Audio is sturdy throughout, offering clean dialogue and bright, bouncy music. There are no extras included on the disc.-Full review at dvdverdict.com"
1,MALISIMA!!!! NO PIERDAN SU DINERo,"Lo peor de lo peor, mal aprovechado el tiempo en verla!!!! Hueca, vacia, sin humor, mas de lo mismo, el gordito tonto y chistoso( pero en esta movie hizo la excepcion, no era gracioso para NADA!) el tonto enamorado( sobreactuadisimo!!!) y el de dinero que era el winner!! :(..... . la pelicula salta de cuadro en cuadro, no es correlativa, hay mucho silencio entre lineas, falta de experiencia y malisimos actores!!!!!!! NO LA VEAN!!!!! MUCHO MENOS LA RENTEN NI COMPREN!!!!!"
5,OMG,"My favorite song is ""We all need a little Christmas"". It really shows her talent. I love her vibrato. Everyone should buy this CD, and sing it for your chior performances! She's so pretty too. I wish I looked like her. She looks exactly like Belle. Buy. Have it shipped to your friends for Christmas. After all, we all need a little. (Christmas)"
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be.,"When I found out Paige O'Hara was the voice of Belle in Disney's Beauty and the Beast, I thought this CD would be a great opportunity to hear more of her work. I was disappointed. I judge a CD by the degree to which I want to return to it. This is not a CD that I find very satisfying. I hope she will try again. She has the gift to put out a really great musical product."
1,the WORST board game ever,"I bought this game for my brother as a Christmas present because I thought it sounded intriguing. It turned out to be the worst Christmas present ever. My brother hated it so much he started screaming and throwing the game pieces across the room. If you're looking to buy a board game please, please, please, please, please, please don't pick this one.The point of the game is that you can choose to be a competitor or a monopolist, and there are different rules for each. Unlike with the other reviewers, to us the game seemed rigged against the monopolists. But whether it's rigged against the monopolists or the competitors, who wants to play a game that's rigged?"
2,Dissapointing,A very comprehensive study of each and every season Butkus played with the Bears. But I was hoping for much more about Butkus's life off the football field. I would have liked to have heard more anecdotes about players he played with and against. Also would have been interesting to hear personal insights from Dick regarding what he felt about the awe-like reputation he inspired on the field from fans and players alike.This reads too much as a season-by-season and game-by-game account of his career. Interesting at first but repetitive and dry over time. I was hoping for more.
5,unbelievable and inspirational,this work of hers is such and inspiration to all to have fought her illness and sing these songs with such and incredible sense of hope and surviving. Climb every Mountain has to be one of my favorites. this is sung with such an emotion of a survivor. What a mountain she did climb!!! i only wish that she had made it because I know that she was only just beginning to give us a taste of the talent that she truly possesed. She will be missed.
2,Not original recordings...,"I think the only original recording is ""Sweet Old-Fashioned Girl."" She does a good job on the others, but for those who won't accept anything less than the originals, this isn't for you."
5,Great Story,"I have loved this series since I was young. The stories are fun and exciting and are not overly ""preachy"". I love the Christian message, but to be honest, never saw the connection when I was younger. To me it was always a good story. Now that I am older I have purchased several copies of the whole series for my own family and also some friends. I think it is a great way to reinforce the story of Christ without making it feel like a bible lesson. Younger children will love the stories and older ones will understand the correlation between them and bible stories. I highly recommend this for any child's library."
1,Visual Basic 2005,"I ordered this product in Dec. of 2005. When I finally received it it came with the correct booklet and 3 correctly labeled install cds but the wrong program on the cd. Instead, I received Visual Web 2005. I have had no luck in receiving a refund. Very unhappy!!!"
5,Great product!,"Great price and great product! I already have one in my master bath that I have had for 5 years and purchased this one for the guest bath. It is the best shower head I have ever had! easy install, even a lady can do it with no tools and it adjust to short or very tall for men and kids."
2,Breaks easily,The flow of water is good. But the &quot;handle&quot; cannot be pulled with even a mild force. We've broken 2 of these and won't buy a 3rd.
2,needs a better arm,"We bought and returned one of these.The positioning arm will not stay put. Shame too cos the water it puts out is VERY nice and the rinse more intense setting is great for washing long hair.Even though we don't adjust for height in our house, I hit the darn thing a few times with the towel (throwing towel over glass door) and it takes like 10 mins to get it to stay up again.Had to return it that is a no go.I was surprised that even though it was positioned higher than the shower door, becasue the spray is downward....water did not go outside the shower."
2,I do not recommend.,"I wanted a large diameter showerhead with some power option and purchased this. This shower head is supposed to have a power shower option but I found out that it just narrows the range of shower to the smaller circle (doe snot come out from the full range) and stil weak. You'll just never get warm or soap off yourself by using this shower head. If you are looking for a soft pour, you might like this."
2,"Nope, It Was Stupid","I recieved this as a Christmas gift although I was perfectly happy with my 15 year old Speakman Anystream. I installed it anyway. The water pressure was low when I had the nozzle on full blast. Plus, water splashed real bad against the walls and floor outside the tub. When somebody turns on the water the pressure gets even lower! My husband tried it and didn't like it either. I put the Speakman back on the next day. -Big Jackie"
1,WaterPik Cascadia,"Very disappointing. The shower head itself is massive - the size of a small dinner plate. It is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it can't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use. Predictably, when you turn on the shower, the head drops groundward, spewing water in a horizontal spray. Installs easily, but save your money."
5,Twilight,Robin has such a light touch on the keyboard. Great to just sit back and listen and enjoy her piano stylings
1,Bad,"How can I trust a doctor like Ornish who doesn't admit that a low or better no fat diet is unhealthy, even more when studies and researches demonstrate that the countries with the lowest heart disease are France and Italy? The Mediterranean diet has a normal percentage of healthy fats, like the ones in olive oil and fish.What does he say about fish? ""You might say, well, why not eat fish, because then you can get the fish oil directly from the fish. And you can. The problem is that the fish with the highest amount of omega 3 fatty acids are also the highest in fat and cholesterol""....so.....his answer is to take pills instead of eating healthy fish 3 times a week with a big salad!!! And I can't understand how a doctor like Oz who suggests to eat fish for Omega 3 had decided to collaborate with somebody suggesting exactly the opposite."
4,Still the best,"I always recommend reading the book by the inventor/creator of the language. That goes for C++ (Stroustrup), Java (Gosling), and C (Ritchie). This book is no exception. Warning: it is a bit dry at times. It is heavily cross-referenced. The backcover is invaluable as a reference.There is one gotcha, however. This is about Ksh93 and most UNIX computers (unfortunately) run Kornshell 88. Ksh93 is much better."
4,I LOVE THIS SHOW!,"I have to say, I enjoyed this show a great deal. I watched from when Bob came one. So I dont have season one. Didnt care for David Caruso. Anyway, I hope that they release the rest of the seasons. I hate it when they just decide to release a few seasons and then say, ""well I think that's enough."" WRONG ANSWER!!!! There are die hard fans out there that enjoy our shows. Stop telling us what we think. Produce the rest of the seasons."
5,Petula Clark Shines !,"Great CD ! I love Don't Make Me Over,The Twelfth Of Never,and Loving Arms. Petula proves she can sing country too ! Fans will love this."
2,disappointing,"I can't believe almost everyone reviewed a 10 for this book! It is the by far the most disappointing book I've read in past year. Adrian is pretty much a typical adolscent story character, which makes the book even duller. Ugu- I can't believe I bought the book."
1,terrible,"I have a 4 year old and a 7 year old. The 7 year old will have nothing to do with this game, and while the 4 year old loves to play the game it is almost impossible to win (not that he seems to care). The pieces also seem like they are likely to break given that they are difficult to get in and out. Definitely not enough pieces to get really creative and/or win."
3,boring,"this was another boring movie. again, the trailer showed the excitement and thriller movie was and it wasn't and bored me."
1,Barely wet - extremely disappointing,"The point of language immersion is to put the student in an environment where the new language is used exclusively. Every CD in this set has more English than French. Rather than being immersed in French, the student barely gets wet. Instead, it repeats the standard approach, and is just like most of the language learning materials not claiming to be using the ""immersion"" method. Extremely disappointing."
5,Essential for Celtic Spiritual Practice,"Though Pagans may be put off by some of the Christian overlay in this book, it is an essential compendium of traditional Gaelic prayers, charms and incantations. You may need to go to the Library to find the Gaelic versions, but it is well worth your time."
2,Dissappointig,"Collected over a hundred years ago by an excise man, I was interested to read this as a witness to Celtic spirituality. However the amount of invocation of the Virgin Mary and prayers to saints leads me to think it is more to do with Roman Catholic spirituality. It is an interesting compilation of a now mainly lost oral tradition but one is not alone in questioning the historical bias of the author. Presbyterianism was not the malevolent influence on music and dance in the Hebrides which he makes it out to be. Read Donald MacLeods more contemporary assessment for a very different view. I confess this is the one book among my reviews which I did not manage to read to the end."
1,This is not progressive,"After sampling some of the tracks it became obvious that this is just hard rock and does not even come close in style to groups such as; Camel, Yes, Steve Hackett, Peter Gabriel, or even Dave Mathews. It is most definately not progressive rock."
4,"Star Trek is fiction, this book is not!","WOW! Heavy reading. It's brain food. I have studied it twice and changed my mind about a lot of thigs like the subconscious, UFO's and the like. Any reader interested in outer space and the future of this planet will really enjoy the revelations of facts put forth in this book."
2,Not much going on here,"I bought two of these - one for my 3 1/2 year old daughter and one for her four year old cousin - for Christmas. The cousin opened hers and said, ""Okayyyy..."" like, what's this supposed to be?My daughter liked that hers smelled like grapes but that novelty wore off in about a second. True, you can brush her hair but the head is already ""made up"" with glitter paint so it's not really a make-up toy. It comes with a pot of lip gloss that is transparent on the enclosed applicator so really only adds a shine when put on the already done up doll face.The little compartment on the front and the bottle caps that open just reveal pictures. Once you've looked at those, that's pretty much it.One week after Christmas and this toy is sitting on a table unnoticed. Doesn't provide enough interactivity. If your little girl really wants to make over a doll and see the difference she can make in the doll's appearance, this is not the one. Keep searching."
1,Got Taken,Ordered this DVD in Sept and it arrived in November as a gift for Christmas for my husband. After Christmas we find out we can't play it. It cannot be played in the US. You need a special player which was not mentioned when I purchased the item. Knowing that it was being purchased for viewing in the US nothing was said by the exporter (third party) They refuse to allow me to return the item. I can't view so a review of the item is impossible. Never again!
3,Interesting Guide to Shfting Paradigms,"Easy read, good overview of shifting global environment.very interesting 'Post-Information Society' theory.First 100 pages tidy but overly simplistic recap of what we all know (Part I and II). Part III very good reading, thought provoking, unique and vision altering concepts introduced (especially chapter 8 - The Post-Information Society)."
3,Nicely made but too big,The product is nicely made but the metal plate was a little too big. I have a somewhat big head but that metal plate was still more than what was needed.
5,an answer to lakesia b johnson,"You can find the juicebox juiceware chips(videos) on the internet. To record up to 30 minutes of music if you have, windows go to windows media player click on ""copy to cd or device"" now delete stuff on the right hand side of the screen you should now have a lot more room on your media chip with no problem!"
2,not what it makes you think it is.,"I got the juice box for my son for x-mas I wish I woukdn't have got it. it comes with nothing and you can't find the video's for it.he really didn't care for it. The MP-3 player is the reason we got it but the thing is theres not enough space to record a hole song, and what I went though to find a down load spot made it all even crazyer. I would never tell any one to buy this toy. they should have thought it out better."
2,NOT the companion,"Though advertised as a continuation (i.e. 14th Edition)of the ""Filmgoers companion"" it is only a list of people in the movies. Gone are Halliwell's definitions of movie tradecraft and lists of themes, individual classics and personal notes. A fine actor like Lee J. Cobb gets a single line, while Jayne Mansfield, known more for her off screen antics, gets many more. The quotes from the movie personalities is a nice touch, but when I look up somebodies filmography I do not want to see etc. at the end of an incomplete list."
1,"OK, if you like the letter U described as UGLY.","I can't believe they did a children's book, and showed a dog for the letter ""U"" with the word ""UGLY"". Unbelievable."
3,"Good, but flawed","I have read the other reviews, and have agreed with many of them. The thing i am getting pissed off about is the blitzball section. It is incredibly vague and i figured it would tell me exactly what to do in the beginning to form a great team, nor did they even think to say ""formation 2,3,2 is the best strategy to score a goal, they leave alot of it out.It is best to have it, as a refrence. But gotta say, the people who play it, IE the kids and teens across the world can form one helluva a better strategy guide then an 40 year old man EVER could. [...]."
1,Probably the worst ever,"Strategy guides published by Brady Games always seem to be rife with errors, but this one is quite possibly the worst one I have ever seen. It's full of inacurate maps, incomplete and misleading explanations. In some instances it will tell you only generally what you need to do but give no indication about how to go about doing it. Perhaps worst of all it neglects to tell you about things you should have done until it is far too late to do them.Don't waste your money on this book. Far better help is available for free online."
2,Waste of money,"As a number of people have already stated, this guide is subpar. While i will admit that some parts are definately helpful, this does not make up for what the guide lacks. There are a number of tasks the guide neglects to mention that are required for a number of items that could otherwise be found. The author has the uncanny ability of leaving out important points until chapter 5 or later, at which point he mentions, ""oh, but if you'd done THIS in chapter 1, you chould get THIS..."" Of course, now in chapter 5 and 150 hours into the game, this does little to help a gamer out. Important notes should you buy this guide: (1) During EVERY chapter, check back with the completion guide at the end of the book. They've conveniently neglected to mention everything one should do in the correct chapter, but included it here. (2) Read through all the side quests before beginning in order to circumvent the above problems. (3) Spend your money on something more worth while."
5,The Series,I must say this looks like one of the better of the FF games i played. I have beet FFX and when i heard that FFX-2 was coming out based on FFX i was supprised becouse they have never had a squal to a FF game. Another new thing abour FFX-2 i that the game has a cast of all girls which is also a new detail that has never exploted before which sould lead to a new twist in the game. Well i had better let u guys figure out the other details of the game.PS. From what i heard they are making a FF game for the Internet :-)*Soul-Caliber*
5,I love this CD,"The Cardigans, Komeda, and Cloudberry Jam - besides all being Swedish groups, there is something that connects them further - what to call the sound: ambiant-emo-neo-lounge? The first listens might be a little off-putting, the harmonizing sometimes seeming a tad corny, but it's all a part of their charm. If you like the idea of Stereolab employing a torch singer, then this is highly recommended."
5,Fun,Got this for my 3 year old. Everyone loves it. We use it as a bed side lamp. Way too bright for a night light.
4,It's suprisingly good,"Don't be fooled by her ""name"" or the weak first single. It's a good pop-album with steady self-written songs. Her voice is only average but therefore it's Miss Vic. She's really glam"
1,poor!,"Poor album from a woman with obviously no talent except for Looking good. The reason why Victoria is famous is because she's married to David Beckham. Boring music with cliched lyrics and annoying voice. Virgin records spend 10 million dollar on this and the album sold 50,000 copies and recieved poor reviews from ciritcs."
2,Not her very best....,"This album is not very good, i gotta say... I just don't really like it... The only 2 songs that i think it's OKAY are ""Not Such An Innocent Girl"" and ""Mind Of Its Own"", the others are not very good. I don't even listen to this album that often... Kinda wasting money.... If you are willing to buy this album, why not buy Emma Bunton's album? She's also one of the Spice Girls and her album rocks!!"
3,[Old School Punk],"I first heard these guys on the Search and Destroy show on WAIF here in Cincinnati (Hey Clem), and they totally thrashed! The song ""Preacher's Confession"" is one of the greatest punk songs ever.If you like your music fast, loud, angry, obnoxious and sloppy, invest in the Flower Leperds..."
2,Needs a second edition ...,"This book does not cover MIDP 2.0, only MIDP 1.0. This makes it uninteresting to buy it. Are the authors considering a 2nd edition?Still the book follows the classic nutshell O'Reilly style and is useful as a desktop quick reference.A good aspect also is that unlike other books, it covers some CDC-based PDA programming."
2,Need to improve....,"Should improve description with shortand clear language. In a lot of places,the text is wordy and does not get the point across."
5,Evian Mineral Water Spray,"Excellent quick shipping. I love this product, you can spritz your face with or without make up. Makes you feel fresh clean and cool. Helps set your foundation,blush, etc. It's firms the skin and moisturizes it. Wonderful. What a treat . Thank you"
2,not so lusious,"Though this book has lovely quilts, it is very light on technique. It is more a showcase for the artists quilts. I purchased the book hoping for concise clear instructions and possibly some patterns to get started; this book has no patterns and is really light on instruction. If you enjoy looking at beautiful quilts only, then you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for something with a lot of technical info, keep looking, this is not the book for you."
1,Connectors WILL break in 2 days,"Bought two of these junkers. One for wife and one for me.Next day wife tells me her connectors are broken. Lecture her on carelessness and how she should insert it the right way and how it will never happen to me.Next day I plug it in the car, making sure connectors are right way up. Wife calls. I lift phone to ear. crackling sound. connectors are broken.Tell wife we must have gotten cheap imitation product. Original Sony stuff can't, er WON'T break like this. Bought two more from retail store. One week later both are broken.If you ever answer phone with this connected, the connectors WILL break as sure as eggs are eggs. Also like the egg on my face."
2,Not a well built product,"I bought 4 of these chargers a year ago for each of my family members. One stopped charging. One of them; the plastic clips broke off. These clips stuck to my phone, and it took some time to remove them. 2 still work, although they did not get much use. Not expecting these to hold up either. So far, it has a failure rate of 50% in about a year. I' m going to try a generic charger as these OEM chargers are not well built."
2,Disappointed,"Being a Sony OEM product, I had high hopes for this item. Initially i was impressed with the appearance of the product and the addition of the LED light. However, after just two weeks, one of the clips broke that hold the charger onto the phone - cheap plastic materials. I had to jimmy a rubber band until I bought a new generic charger. I'm much happier with the generic charger, but I do miss the light."
4,Works just like that other tape and is a good cheap filler to get up to free shipping,"Needed tape and a filler so I could get up to the limit for Amazon's free shipping - this worked perfect and now works great just as well as any other tape ... you know the kind ... it starts with and S and ends with cotch. Yeah, that one."
5,"Excellent, award-worth compilation of the Star Wars galaxy",A must-have for all Star Wars die-hard fans
4,off key?,"i know this is not a discussion site, but HOW IN EARTH can you say he sings off key?.......DO YOU THINK THEY WILL SHIP OUT THE CD WHEN TOSHI SINGS OFF KEY??????..what is wrong with you.......toshi has always been one of the greatest singer in japan and in asia..i dont know how you come up with this bull.."
4,Toshi is not sushi,"Toshi Kubota is not a new artist with 9 albums under his belt.The current""nothing but your love"" he has the roots,Raphael saddiq,producing strong musicfor him,as his delivery is flowing through the tracks.Not knowing,you would'nt believe that Toshi is Japanese.Album is full a flavor"
2,Nothing But Weak,"This is probably the worst CD I've purchased all year. (And I've bought a lot.) The music is completely unoriginal, using revamped beats and chords from Guy albums of the early 90s and late 80s, as well as one that rips off the ""more bounce"" chorus from Roger (""Body Bounce"") and another that steals from EPMD. (I think he even used the bassline from a Wayman Tisdale track.) But I could let that go if Toshi delivered his lyrics with any feeling or flavor at all. Unfortunately, he doesn't. The sound alternates from bad Eric Benet and Jon B. impersonations to just bad. And when you think you've found a song with a nice beat, original chords, and decent vocals (""It's Over""), you're utterly disappointed by the lyrics. There are points where you think he's flipping a beautiful metaphor when in fact it's just senseless and connotative of the songs you wrote as a three-year-old -- and then threw away."
1,Gimmick!,"I thought that this album was WACK! The beats were cool, but dude could not sing! The only reason people are digging it is because of the fact that the dude is Japanese. If he was a brother from Atlanta or the south side of Chicago, we'd all be like ""How'd he get a deal""? If this album was an instrumental, it would be cool to play as background music at a club."
3,The Cutting Edge Sound Track,"I bought this CD for one song. I was annoyed that I couldn't purchase the song through I-Tunes. Some songs are ok, but the selection is too diverse for me to like them all."
5,GPs Best Work Ever,Simply the best album of his long career.Perfectly produced.Terrific lyrics.Everything came together perfectly.
4,This book is all you need,"Over about 4 weeks I read this book and took the practice exam in the back. I also used the questions on the CD to drill. I did not read any other books. I passed the test with a 905. I will agree that this book covers more material than you need, but it goes quick and it is very informative."
2,Disappointed,"Although it is relaxing, it is much too short. It only gives 2 guided visualizations that are not long enough for me. I was hoping for more."
4,Intriguing,"There were several things about the tight little community of Russians installed at Villa Petrograd that were disturbing: the sophisticated microbiological equipment, the private zoo that seemed to be unusually well supplied with primate specimens, the secrecy......."
4,Accurate portrayal of the abused and the perpetrator mindset,A coworker told me about this book and said I had to read it. She was right. I am a social worker who works with the domestically abused and the perpetrators and Clark brilliantly managed to crawl inside both their heads and create an accurate portrayal of both. I've never seen that done before and done so true to life. Anyone who thinks they are in any type of abusive relationship should read this and then get out and quick. Excellent work. A must read!
4,Hats off to Clark. She's gonna be huge!,"If you haven't read this steamy face-paced novel yet, you should. A friend recommended it and I couldn't put it down. Whew! What a work out. Who needs the gym when you have books like this to get the adrenaline pumping 100 miles an hour!"
3,Slightly disappointing,"Not as good as I thought it should be, caused by one thing; All the great instrumental tracks from the movie were way too short, and some of the best (among them the track featured in the last car chase in the movie) suddenly has vocals. That had been fine if the long instrumental version had been included too, but sadly, it hasn't been."
5,Great Product,A very simple solution for my heating/AC needs in a room not occupied 24hrs a day. Simple to install and to program.
2,"Hard to find ingredients, and so-so recipes","This is the second book I purchased by Rocco, and again I've been let down. Many of the ingredients are hard to find, and some of the flavor combinations just don't work.."
4,JINGLE...JANGLE,"Recorded in '68 to capitalize on Shatner's Trek fame and savaged by obtuse, humorless critics both then and now, this is the first great landmark of aural high camp. Halting and bombastic, The Shat's trademark delivery is adroitly accompanied by overwrought band, choral and orchestral arrangements as he croons, wails and sputters iconic Shakespearean dialogue, contemporaneous Dylan, Beatles and Ervin Drake covers...and more! Comparable recordings have since been voiced by Eddie Albert, Telly Savalas, Andy Griffith, Phyllis Diller, Merv Griffin and fellow Trek star Leonard Nimoy, among many others. Those most comparable of this album's 1968 peers are Rod McKuen's Lonesome Cities and Kim Fowley's psychotic Outrageous, yet Shatner possessed a nearly singular ability to parody the tacky zeitgeist of the late '60s. Absolutely nothing (not even Shatner's amusing 1977 live album or entertaining 2004 effort, Has Been) can compare to this album. Nothing."
5,great cd! but probably for the wrong reason,The first time I heard this cd was a college buddy of mine who decided to share this monstrocity with me. This had to be one of the funniest things I ever had to listen to.
2,Gloriously awful,"I love this album, but from a purely technical perspective I have to admit it lies somewhere in between spoken word, a vegas cover act, and torture. It's awful, but hysterically awful.Shatner can't sing either. However, like Plan 9 from Outer Space, it's so nonsensical, it borders on great. I mean really, who thought setting up the theme from Cyrano and Mr. Tambourine Man as a medley was a good idea? His Mr. Tambourine Man is the most hysterically awful cover. Ever. The arrangement sounds like Mr. Tambourine Man does broadway, constipated.Spend the dollar."
5,So bad it's good!!!,"I found this bizarre gem in the used bin at Soundwaves in Houston. Bought it up and never looked back. After many years, it is still the most sought after (and frequently borrowed!) CD in my collection.Hats off to you Captain Quirk! Nobody does it quite like you (and maybe that's not a bad thing after all!)Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU. Mr Shatner!!"
5,Why didn't someone tell me sooner?,"I've always had a love hate relationship with school. I LOVE LEARNING despite enough years of school that I should be a doctor. Groening hit the nail on the head though, that school is about everything but learning. Conformity is king. It kind of makes me sick.I have a degree in art education, taught school for one semester. Love teaching, love the kids. Hate the system. I don't want to go to ""school"" the rest of my life. Ironically, I think I picked this up at the end of that semester. I just picked it up and read it from cover to cover a few years later. A wicked gift for someone in education considering a change of career...His actual diary from elementary school should be ""required reading"" for anyone in education."
4,nice...but.....,"I found the AM99 to be pretty easy to understand and to begin using. It doesn't have all the words that I had been learning buy studying the Pimsleur Mandarin course but that was to be somewhat expected. My only disappointment was the Pinyin input capabilities. 1st you cannot enter tones. 2nd the results are all in Chinese and you have to select each character to get it's English meaning and you have to start all over to go to the next character. 3rd there were several Pinyin words that I tried to enter but the Am99 would not accept them. Try a simple word such as ""nar3"" and you can only input ""na"". Pinyin input was the #1 reason I went with the AM99 and after getting it Pinyin input is my #1 complaint. The AM99 also is limited due to its clock functions being set to Beijing. You set it for you local time (wherever that is) and the AM99 takes that to be Beijing local."
4,"appealing, easy to grasp the credit revolution","Calder book is an appealing read. I must agree with other reviews that this is usually not a very interesting subject, finance and credit, but Calder presents it in an interesting matter that can be quite witty at times. The reader will see how Victorian money management ideas of the past were largely accepted passively by most but only actually followed by few. Credit has existed since before this countries foundation argues Calder and he details the progression of credit systems to present times."
1,Only lasted two weeks!,"My first impressions of this pouch were fantastic. I really liked it a lot. It was nice looking, easy to use and fit the phone very well. But after only two weeks of pretty gentle use the clip tore out. The leather used to hold the clip to the pouch is not reinforce, and was too thin. It's too bad, because otherwise this was a very nice case."
4,Pretty nice,it was a reallllly nice casei had it for a few months and then the clip came out of the leather in the back...disapointing but ordering another one
2,Zero frills case,"Very simple case. If all you want is something to protect your phone and zero frills - here it is. The following sentence in the Amazon review is misleading: ""A simple flick of your finger releases it to expose a cutout for viewing the time or to see who's calling"". What are they talking about - this case is completely cutout-less. It's more like: a simple flick of your finger to unbutton the closure, and an equally simple pulling motion while grabbing onto your phone with two fingers will expose the phone screen for viewing the time or to see who's calling."
2,RAZR V3 Vertical Pouch,I was not impressed with the performance of this case. I purchased the first one and in about a month the construction that attaches to the case(plastic and cardboard) broke making it impossible to fix. It was attached to my belt on the left side. When I would get in and out of the car it wasn't constructed well enough to hold up. I then purchased a second one and inside a week it did the same thing. The case is very economical. I would suggest removing it before getting into a car to prevent damage to the case.
1,Motorola V3 Razr Phone OEM Case Belt Clip,"I didn't even receive the item that was shown. The one sent was cheaply made with a cheap plastic clip that broke immediately.I let the seller know, but they didn't respond so obviously they aren't concerned with making their customers happy."
4,Amzing,"This CD is hilarious! It makes a great gift for any trekkie. It is so incredebly funny to hear Leornard Nimoy try to sing. The music is funny, but not wonderful, and so is Nimoy's voice. I recommend this product strongly."
2,"A little quirky, but has some catchy tunes!","While it is easy to poke fun at movie and TV actors/actresses who venture into the world of singing, it is unfair to do so without actually listening to the material they offer. Leonard Nimoy is no Frank Sinatra in this album/CD, but none-the-less, there are a few catchy titles. Unfortunately for Mr. Nimoy, these are primarily the instrumental tracks, but the song ""Highly Illogical"" for some strange reason compels me to listen to it over and over. Perhaps it's some sort of Vulcan Mind Control thing, I don't know. Anyway, it is clear that Mr. Nimoy did put a great deal of time into this production, and while it's not anywhere close to grammy material, it still represents a valiant attempt at branching out into another field; something too many of us are reluctant to attempt in our lifetimes. <You can stop the violins, now!> END"
1,Utterly Awful,"I had both of Leonard Nimoy's albums when I was a kid, and even then it was apparent that Nimoy can't carry a tune any more than he could carry William Shatner over Niagara Falls while balanced on a strand of dental floss! There are times when I wince, it's so bad. But if you're a fan, it doesn't matter how bad Nimoy is. You'd probably buy it just as a collector's item.The CD is probably just mastered from the vinyl press. That shouldn't affect the quality (and I use the term loosely), though. Buying it would be...highly illogical."
2,Plastic parts break easily,"This product is made of cheap white plastic that breaks easily. The piece that attaches the handle to the hose and the holder bracket both cracked within a year and the item was not usable. Granted, $20 may not be a lot of money, but I don't like a hassle of shopping for replacement after only one year. Junk."
1,cheap,This was made very cheaply and did not compare to their original product. it looks the same but does not perform in any ways like the old Waterpik that was formerly made.They need to spend more time on this product to make sure that it does what it is supposed to do. As it is I took it down and used a regular shower sprayer head and got rid of this cheap version. I will never buy one of these again.
2,water flow is feeble or weak,"I just stepped out the shower using this showerhead. If I must have this showerhead at home, then I would like to live else where. So I am returning this.The water flow is weak or feeble. It feels like a 1.5 Gallon / minute at most, and I have even removed the rubber rings inside that are supposed to limit water flow.I had an Interbath showerhead before, and that felt like almost double as strong as this Waterpik I tried today. I already try to maximize the water flow by various settings, including letting the ""pulse"" and ""spray"" on both at the same time. But none of the mode matches the max water flow I got from before.One more thing about the plastic tube: it stinks. I think probably due to cutting cost or something, the plastic tube is made of some material that stinks. So if you use it, be ready to tolerate the smell until it goes away."
2,Easily broken,This product worked well when initially installed but cracked where it connects to the pipe after 6 months of use.
5,It is simple and does the job perfectly,Have had many much more expensives handheld with a dozen different settings that no one really needs. All you need is water to come out and something that stays clean without mildew forming over time. We have had one in our Bahamas house for 3 years and still looks clean and pretty much like it did when it was new. Recommend it.
1,A bore,"Really a feeble, yet extremely inoffensive, effort. ""Bloody Mess"" always tries his best to be shocking, and succeeds only in sending the handful of people who ever heard of this tedious figure off for an extremely sound night's sleep. If you're an insomniac, pick this humdrum effort up. You'll doze superbly."
5,Her last great album to date.,"As a major Janet fan, ""The Velvet Rope"" to me was the last great album that Janet has released to date. A majority of the succeeding releases catered to the bottom of the barrel of the commercial dreck. But not on here. On this CD, Janet showcased a much more of a growing maturity and greater personal mood on this CD. Although many portray it as sad and down, I strongly disagree. While nothing like RN or Control, it is better than it's two following albums AFY and DJ and better than even the Janet album. Together again is a classic. Highly recommended."
5,Kelli Williams CD Purchase,Execellent Product and the CD was as advertised. Seller also sent the product quickly. Will recommend and use in the future.
5,"Realistic, Thorough and Concise","Brenda Aloff is a pioneer in her field. She knows the in's and out's of dog behavior better than anyone I have ever read.This book explains not only what you should do, but why you should do it and helps dispell some of the ""old school"" trains of thought regarding dogs, behavior and training.TRULY A MUST HAVE!"
5,Masterpiece,This is one of the great collections of all time. Can't believe there isn't an MP3 version of this. Truly amazing.
5,The Best Rage CD So Far,"Live & Rare is by far the best Rage CD so far. Rage sounds great live, because they don't have sounds stuck into their songs that they can't reproduce on stage. The band seems to get into the music more when they're on stage, this makes the soungs sound just that much better. Another great thing is the CD contains some songs that are not on any other CD. Live & Rare is a great CD that any Rage fan should have."
1,The Worst Band in the World?,"Terrible, and sounds repetitive at this point. Misinformed about politics, with a one track, narrow mind {whilst claiming to be open minded} leads to good music, but very naive lyrics. Isn't one of these a Harvard grad? Maybe they should read a newspaper. [you can't rage against the machine, when you become part of the machine]"
5,Instant Classic! one of the funniest movies ever!,Instant Classic! one of the funniest movies ever! this is one of my favorite movies ever! i'm glad i finally got this on blu-ray! anyone who has ever worked with the public should be able to relate to this film. the humor is raunchy but that's what makes this movie great! great cast as-well.
1,Ugh. Waaaaay too crude for me.,"A co-worker of mine and I were talking the other day and telling stories about our past jobs. We learned that we had both worked as wait staff in restaurants, before, and he asked me if I had ever seen this movie. I said no, and he told me ""You have to see it! It makes fun off all the stuff that goes on in a restaurant work environment - complaining about tips, grouchy customers, cooks messing with people's food, management hitting on the young high-school-age hostesses and all that other stuff."" Well, I found it at the library the other day and gave it a try. I made it (painfully) through a half-hour before I just turned it off. It was way too crude and profane for me. I'm not into that type of movie. I felt dirty for watching that much of it. I kept on hoping it would get better, but it only got worse. I wouldn't recommend this movie to ANYONE."
1,Formulaic stinker,"Predictable, cheap. Blatant over-the-top jokes. If you loved Meatballs 3, you'll like Waiting."
4,Every resturant caught on film,"This film, funny with a very thin plot line, reminds us of every place we have gone out to eat at or even worked at that we have ALL been at that position of life. The actors virtually portray every person we encounter at every resturant with accuracy. I love this film,....not just for the sophmoric-toilet-grade humor,...but for the sheer reminder that I, who works in resturant businesses, should know that it is best to leave a generous tip and not aggrivate the person who is cooking your food for a little floor spice makes everything taste right."
5,pom pom dance must have,true to size perfect for dance class very confortable does take some getting use to if this is your first pair.
5,Excelent option!,"Hi!i highly recommend these shoes for people that are taking dacing classes. In my case, i dance in a salsa company in Mexico and i took the advise of the other custommers to buy these shoes half number up, once they arrive i wish i had done it for another half number up, but since i used them 3 times a week and sometimes more, now they are fin but they are narrow. They are very comfortable and even my professor want to order exactly these shoes too!"
4,Wonderful shoe for the price!,"I was concerned buying this shoe because of the variety of reviews but I am so happy I did. I have been using the shoes for Zumba class. There is enough support and flexibility but yet enough movement in the sole since Zumba is quick on your feet with so many pivots and turns. I noticed prior to getting the shoes, I was beginning to have some knee problems but not anymore. Just remember all the reports......you must get one size larger....no if's, and's or but's. I wear a 9.5 and purchased a 10.5 and I actually hesitated but I am so glad I did. Again this is a great shoe with a price that won't break your purse."
2,Used these for a Zumba class,"I wore these in one Zumba class and they were very uncomfortable and ended up hurting my feet. I do feel that you should just get 1/2 size larger than your normal street shoe, though. I wear a size 9 and got a 10 due to the reviews. Though these fit, I think they should fit a little more snug; for Zumba, anyway. You don't want your foot moving around in the shoe. They seemed a little clunky to me too. Kind of like I was wearing a man's shoe. I returned them and got a pair of Capezio Women's Web Dansneaker; and I love them!!"
2,"too heavy, for jazz!!","it is too much shoe...very heavy , good support for zumba maybe but not for jazz!! didn't like them at all!!"
5,The Absolute BEST,"As a former dancer I loved to use these when teaching. Really saved your feet from wearing high heel shoes all the time. They provide excellent flexibility and you can wear them all day with comfort. I was a teacher for several years after leaving the competition floor. Now I have ordered them again to use in a job that keeps me on my feet for 4 hours at a time on hard floors. I needed black shoes and recalled how well these worked for me in the dance years. I love them! I would not recommend them for a hike in the woods etc. as they are flexible and soft in the arch, wouldn't want to step on a rock. :) I am happy I remembered these great shoes for this new job.. Thanks Capezio!"
2,Runs very very very small,"The shoes are not awful,but I wouldn't buy them again, they crush your toes even when you wear 3 sizes bigger. The design is for people with Hobbit feet! So if you are a Hobbit, get the shoes."
4,Comfortable shoe for Zumba Newbie,"I am new to Zumba, have plantar fasciitis, arthritis and have 1970's shag carpeting (I know, really?). I wanted to be sure I wouldn't aggravate existing issues or create new ones. Based on Amazon, Zappos and blog ratings, I purchased three different shoes to try find the best for me. Thank you to all the reviewers who suggested getting 1 1/2 size larger in the Capezios. I usually take a street size 8.5 and bought both the 9.5 and 10. I kept the 10s and returned the 9.5. The other shoes were Nike Musique and the Ryka Studio D. I kept the Ryka in 9 just to have a backup and to have a black shoe in addition to the white Capezios. I use my orthonics in the Dansneakers without any problems. They have plenty of padding and are easy to slide but also control. So far, so good."
4,sizing and utility,"I have worn capezio dance shoes for 50 years, so I trusted that these would live up to the same standard as those I had worn before. I wear a 7 1/2 M, but after reading the reviews decided to order a full size larger than normal street shoes. Even with the extra length, they are a bit short. They also run a bit narrow and do not come in wide widths. However, that said, I will keep them and wear them with tigts or thin socks. The sole allows quite well for slides and turns and the shoe has very nice arch support."
2,Not the shoe for me!!,"First, I normally wear an 8 1/2 M or 9 M. I bought a size 9 M in the shoe. Too short, my toes were begging to be free plus the shoe just felt tight all around. Second, the shoe hurt my instep. I guess due to the lack of support. I did read the other reviews before I purchased them and I planned to buy some kind of sole insert but I just don't have the heart to put my feet to the test. I never made it to Zumba class with these shoes, in fact I never left the house in these shoes. I liked the idea but I need something a little more sturdy that don't hurt my feet."
2,Run Small,"I purchased these shoes for Zumba dance. I think the shoe would have been fine except there was no indication the sizes run 1/2 to 1 size smaller than you normally wear in a sneaker. I thought I'd use them for my cardio dance class first, but had to change after only ten minutes. I didn't notice much of an arch support either. Sadly, I had to purchase another pair of shoes and went with my favorite brand -- Ryka!"
2,not happy,these dance sneakers look as if someone danced in them and they were packed up and sent to me. the bottom looks like some one walked around in these sneakers. these are for my 10 year old daughter. she dances 5 days a week and she really needs them for a important dance show she has coming. i dont have the time to send this item back cause they wont b sent back in time. but just know im very dissappointed with the condition of this item. i order from this site all the time and i dont appreciate receiving items in this condition.
5,"Great quality: confortable,light and good looking. Plus fast delivery.","I ordered size 10m which depends on the comments ( my street size is 9). It arrived on the second date.It's bigger then I thought when I put it on,I returned it for exchange via Amazon online immediatly. A couple days later I received size m 9.5, it fits me perfectly.It's very comfortable than other shose for zumba class, nice great quality,good looking."
2,Sizing is an issue with these shoes....,I ordered these shoes 2x. I wear an 8. I ordered an 8.5 - too small. Then a 9- still too small! Had to pay return shipping on both and restocking fee. I still dont have shoes that I can wear.
2,not what i thought,"ok so these shoes felt bulky and hard on the hardwood floor surface, not geat at supporting your weight either, halfway thru zumba i had to take them off and just use my regular sneakers...my feet hurt even tho they fit me right, for some reason it makes my big toe hurt a lot .... do not recommend these shoes"
3,Not what I expected,"I'm very new to Zumba, and needed the proper shoe before beginning my DVD workout on a berber-ish type carpeted area. After searching, I ordered this item in white; my street/dress shoe size is normally 8 1/2 W, depending on the style. After reading other reviews, I ordered this item in 10M. When I rece'd this, it pinched my feet, didn't feel comfortable & looked thick around the yoke/neck of the shoe (think corrective shoes); so, to compare, I ordered the DS24 Rockit Dansneaker to see how they differed. I sent the DS11 Fierce Dansneaker back, as the DS24 Rockit (in a 9 1/2) not only fit/felt, but looked better. As other reviewers noted, Zumba shoe laces need to be snug, but not require a ""breaking in"" period. Hope this review helped, its a nice shoe, but didn't work out for me."
2,RUN'S SMALL,"I use these for Zumba. The shoes hurt my toes! I wear a 10 1/2, so I got that. But wish I had ordered an 11. I'm sure they would be wonderful, it they fit correctly...I can't wear them beyond 30 minutes without my feet aching. Now I don't even lace them entirely! I'm still hoping they'll ""stretch"" a little."
2,wrong book name,"On page 122 the author say:""XSLT 1.1 changes recommends that the node-set() be deprecated"" Then, the author begin to use node-set() to make some long examples to explain several important concept like ""param"", ""variable"", ""include"", ""import""... I do not understand why. Many important( if not most ) examples are depends on ""MSXML"" own extensition. I would suggest the book should be named as ""Professional MSXML"". Of course it is a good book if you prefer ""MSXML""."
5,Does the job other cant,I hung a 40-inch LCD with this. I had a problem where I had to hang it on a side wall rather than the back wall. Most hangers can't do this. This one really has the ability to be moved back and forth to where you need it to be. The price is also a good deal as I have seen similar ones for $300.
5,Great product!,I didn't have a clue how to go about buying a wall mount for my TV. I started reading reviews and was drawn to this model. It is great! My husband hung this with no problems; it's sturdy and moves in all directions. I would definitely recommend this!
5,"Terrific, sturdy free-motion wall mount","I bought one of these in July 2009 and love it. Before this, I had a flat-mount, (which was impossible to get behind to plug in or change input cords, and if you needed to fish a new hdmi cable through the wall it was a nightmare to remove the TV from the wall mount). So I did a lot of research before deciding on this SANUS. This swing-arm mount is easy to use and sturdy. First you attach the bracket to the wall. Then you attach the wall mount to your tv. Then you simply tilt the wall mount and set in on the bracket, and tighten it down. The full motion works great, so you can move or tilt your tv easily. If you need to run a new hdmi wire just extend the arm out and make the switch! If you need to take the tv down, unplug wires, tilt arm up, and remove. Easy peasy. Well worth a few extra bucks for this mount vs a flat mount. (I just bought a 2nd one for the bedroom.) Get it."
1,Choose any book other than this one,From a students view: Using this for an intro class to numerical analysis was a big mistake for my professor. I was disgusted by the numerous mistakes made in examples. Obviously it was a waste of the author's time to do them accurately. I can't believe this book even got through publising.
1,What I think of This Book,"boolean HaveATestTomorrow, DoIUnderstandWhatLoanIsTryingToSay;HaveATestTomorrow = true;int timeTillTestinSeconds = 600;while(HaveATestTomorrow){DoIUnderstandWhatLoanIsTryingToSay = false;timeTillTestinSeconds--;}// sigh"
4,Luscious writing,"One of the best passages in the book: ""In Swedish Haven, thrift was a word that was pronounced as reverently as the name Jesus ...""Within the context of language, phrasing, pace, and general observations on humanity and society at a certain time and place in America, the Lockwood Concern is a feast that somehow delights all of the reader's senses.I especially loved how Mr. O'Hara depicted the temporary juxtaposition of an old order and a new, such as between the agrarian v. urban and Pennsylvania Dutch v. English.I rate the book a four instead of a five because Mr. O'Hara's characterizations, while seemingly deep and intriguing in the beginning of the book, simply repeat with small variation each generation, which dulled my interest."
5,"If heaven existed, this would be better","""Is This It"" is one of my favorite CDs of all time. Every song is performed so well; each is absolutely delightful to listen to. Julian Casablancas has a wonderfully unique voice; in male singers, I want the voice to have character, and Julian's definitely does. The Strokes maintain the illusion of carelessness and effortlessness while executing the tracks beautifully. I love their style, and only wish that they had kept it throughout the third and fourth albums, which increasingly tended toward the electronic side of indie rock."
3,Its like the Velvet Underground.. only not.,"Now, this is in no way to say that i do not like The Strokes. I do however find it very interesting that they are being held as this new wave of great rock. Though in this new climate of Nu-Metal and Rap-Rock acts, a band that emulates the Velvets is a breath of fresh air, and it is. However it is hardly the second coming.The one thing that gets me about The Strokes is how almost disposable their music is. It doesnt necessarilly leave you with a lasting impression, and once you change CDs your mind doesnt linger with what was just played. The best song New York City Cops, was sadly left off the US version. its a nice solid effort. Hopefully their next venture will be one that is more meaningful and a bit more themselves than Lou, Cale and Nico."
5,Punk Rock!!!,These guys have brought punk rock back to life! The CD is great all the way through. The track NYC cops reminds the good old Ramones! I agree with someone that said this CD is the best material since the CBGB times...
3,Why the hype?,"Oh, some press... Why is it always necessary to hype bands that aren't just worth the hype? All the shameless reviews I've read about this album (I don't think there's a superlative left that's NOT been used) made me utterly curious and when I heard it, I ofcourse was dissapointed, like many, many others here.'Is This It?' is not hyper-bad; there are some really OK songs on there; including 'Soma' and 'Alone, Together', but if you heard a few; you've heard them all. Basic drums, dead-simple guitar lines, and that Julian Casablancas guy singing the same everywhere through a distortion-effect. I was surprised even to read an interview with Graham Coxon saying they were 'the saviours of pop-music'; which is absolute nonsense. It's a nice album, but the Strokes will be forgotten about in 1 or 2 years. And why are they so arrogant anyway? They really should be careful not to believe the hype themselves."
1,poster boys of todays music industry,I've read the hype and I've listened to the CD. It's just not very good. Why not just listen to the Ramones who were 25 years earlier and better anyway.No one will know who the strokes are 5 years from now. I promise.
1,Come on Guys,"This is a New York band? I thought New York had edge. Come on guys, get out there and live a little. What are you, holed up in some foofoo penthouse living it up or something? Girls and parties? Go to Harlem, go to the meat packing district - go somewhere and find yourselves some inspiration. God - is this CD bland or what?I live in New York and there are a lot of new bands with a point of view. There are a lot of bands trying to DO SOMETHING NEW. Not these bums. And some of those bands went to prep schools that are even hoity-toitier than the ones these jokers went to, so that ain't the reason. There's one decent song here and all I can say about it is that its fun. Jiminy Chrikit, if I want fun I'll listen to some pederast LA ska band!!If I wasn't going to return this CD I'd throw eggs at it!"
4,fun but......,"OK let me start off by saying i like this cd a LOT- but as i listen to it more and more the songs kind of start to melt into eachother and theres a few of them that i cant really tell apart- sure there are songs like last nite that differ greatly from everything else but teh first two songs just dont sound THAT different- its usually the same chords- i dnno, maybe i just haven't listened to it enough but overall- its a great cd and its worth buying"
4,So much hoopla!,"Wow, critics and fans get really worked up about the virtues of this album. Sneered at by some critics as populist tripe, and adored by everyone else, this album has clearly touched a nerve somewhere.Is it enjoyable? Very much. Is it amazing and genre-pushing? No.You will enjoy it anyway, like a snickers bar or fast food. It is tasty, disposable, and fast."
4,Better than Most CDs released this year....,"The song ""Last Nite"" is one that I could listen to repeatedly, but two weeks ago I listened to the cd ""White Blood Cells"" by the White Stripes (Awesome CD! Get it NOW!) and I have set this cd aside for now. The vocals on this album sound ""muddled"" or not clear. I think it was done to make the album sound like a classic rock album, but I couldn't help but be annoyed by it. I would like to know what the lyrics are (no lyrics included). Despite the minor faults, this is still better than most of the other cds that have been released this year."
3,This album should have consisted of one song,"I have read many reviews that say this is a great album. While I won't disagree that there are some decent songs here, I keep thinking that all the songs sound the same. They have the same rythym, similar chords and bass lines, and nearly identical beats. This is a fairly short record (35 minutes), but I think they could have fit all the musical variation in about 10 minutes. The first time I heard Last Night, I kept thinking I had just heard it, but I knew I had never listened to the album before. Then I realized it sounded EXACTLY like Someday, which came just two songs earlier. I bet they wrote one really good song that everybody loved, then they decided to cash in by just modifying a beat here, a note there, and writing some new lyrics, and voila, there's your album. I gave it 3 stars because it would be the ideal album for someone with a short term memory that lasted about 3.5 minutes."
2,Whaaaat?!,"This album is bad, kids. Rich kids from New York who dress snappy put out a mediocre collection of songs that sound nothing like the Velvet Underground or Television, despite what some critics would like to have you believe, and the whole world flips out. Yeah, the Strokes have a good song or two (Last Nite, despite the purposeful misspelling, isn't bad) but all in all, it [stinks]. Plus, that whole ""return of rock"" thing is SO annoying."
3,Hmmmmm,"You know how when you are at a sporting event and a player on the opposing team is hyped by fans and the media as the next best thing and the crowd is chanting ""Over-rated"" clap clap clap-clap-clap! ""Over-rated"" Well that is exactly what I wanted to do when I heard this CD. It is not bad, but it is definitly nothing groundbreaking and there are several bands doing this stripped down rock and roll thing a lot better than these guys. If I ever start a band, I would like to hire their PR guy because the hype surrounding this band was (and still is) incredible"
2,Been There,"While I don't find this album to be terrible, I do find it terribly unremarkable. All hype aside, this band is O.K. I've been told to just to listen to it and take it in. Whatever happened to freewill or having and opinion? I don't have to accept it if I don't want to.Being that their single sounds like a ripoff of Tom Petty's ""American Girl"" ..., I am even more disappointed in the uneven sound of the record. They do sound ""homegrown"" and it has been a while since NYC had a band to boast about. And yes, many bands sound like the Velvet Underground and Tom Petty ripped his sound off of the Byrds. But, at my jaded age, it's hard to get past the contrived look and sound here. This is nothing new and not very interesting. No, this is NOT it, at least for me."
2,"Strokes, but whose?","Okay this is such an exciting group it's like Lou Reed 30 years ago shamelessly ripping off songs of the 70's. Soma, is that the disco song from the movie slap shot? I keep humming ""Last night I said, lets rip off Tom Petty's American Girl."" This why no one respects critics. Some bands get nailed for being knock offs and some are just ignored. Why the critics love the Strokes is beyond me."
2,i wish i was this cool,"Wow! the way these guys dress is so cool! Thats what the strokes would like to hear isn't it? Because thats all they seem to care about, take real rock stars like Keith Richards and Jimmy Page, they only cared about the music but they still looked cool! I suppose though that because rock 'n roll is now fashionable again there may be some bands that have worked hard actually make it and are not important rock stars because their rich daddies have bought them the breaks. Last Nite, is a good track but it sounds very similar to the rest of the album, they all seem to be the same chords being strummed and the same beat.One day you guys WILL discover good music, just believe!"
1,Bands like this-why rock is boring,"I know why this band is so overrated. 14 year old wanna be rock stars in their basements, listening to a rock radio station, all of a sudden hear something that isn't nu-metal. ""Wow,"" they think, ""I've never heard anything like this before."" They watch MTV 2 and see the video with Family Feud in it, and think ""I like this band."" Then they become fans. What they don't realize is that this ""new music"" has been done MANY years ago, and much better in fact.Is This It is an album that bores me to death. I hear ""Sometimes"" and I bite my nails. That's how much I dislike The Strokes. People think they're a real rock band because of their ripped jeans. Yeah, that'll definitely make you ""The Saviour of Rock n Roll! Kind of sad. I wouldn't bother listening to this album, because it's a rip off.ONE WORD: WANNABES."
2,What's the big deal?,"It was difficult for me to believe just how hyped this band actually was; it was even harder for me to believe that people actually bought the hype. For the love of god folks, if you honestly think this is the end all of rock n roll then you really need to get out more. I just can't for the life of me understand why everyone thinks this record is so good, yeah so it's better than Limp Bizkit, but so are alot of things. It doesn't sound at ALL like the Stooges, there's no Television guitar work on here, yeah, so the singer sounds a little like Lou Reed, big deal. So someone ripped off VU, it's not the first time.All this is is a pop record, an okay pop record with a good single (last night or whatever it's called). Calm down already.Yeah, and they never payed their dues, not cool."
1,The Strokes are to Rock what WMDs are to Justifying War,"They are both hack jobs that yearn your attention, but you later find out that you've been misled.Save your money and either borrow this CD from someone else, or get it as a gift. Don't waste your money. Better yet, scratch the 1st suggestion, you don't want to coerce your friends in such a baseless manner!!!"
3,Not even in the same league... 3.5 stars.,"In spite of all the praise and hype this CD has received it just comes down to being a good rock and roll album. While the band takes it's sound from legendary bands such as The Velvet Underground, Television and The Stooges, they are not even in the same league as these bands. No the Strokes are not the saviors of rock and roll and no this is not the best release of 2001. This release is WAY over-hyped and the band will probably fall victim to the corporate rock machine, the rock journalists and the fawning mainstream public who have deemed this band a living legend even before their sophomore effort is released. That being said, there is really nothing new or original here yet it is a great record. However I have grown tired of the hype and am rapidly loosing interest. Sometimes we should just let the music speak for itself. But it's all about selling records isn't it?"
3,"This Isn't It, But It's Close","The Strokes are okay, but check out the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and find out whatever happened to your rock n' roll."
4,METROPOLITAN & THE CASSETTES rock!! if you dig the strokes,"hey man thanks to the strokes people might pay attention to real indie rock bands. if you don't own ""down for you is up"" by METROPOLITAN and THE CASSETTES new self titled cd on lovitt records, then you aren't living. you should buy them today!! the strokes hit big cause they've got a huge money machine backing them up, these guys are doing it themselves and the music is much better, too bad they're daddy doesn't own a huge modeling agency in new york..... check out the buzz at metropolitansound and thecassettesmusic, and buy that strokes album as well it is a good listen at any rate."
5,Realllly good.,I like everything on this cd from Is this it? to Soma to Automatic Stop.Its all good and i like every song on this and normally i dont like new rock bands but this one is really good.BUY IT!
1,Horrible!,"The Strokes is the worst band since The Beatles. The music is really slow and POP, dont buy it, or ill be sorry."
3,overrated,"There's nothing bad about this CD, but I can't say that I can see nearly enough good about it to justify the hype, and certainly not the frequent comparisons to VU, the Ramones, etc. For that matter, I don't think they're really in the same league as the White Stripes. So, basically, it's cool sounding stuff, but no great songs, nothing to quit your job and become a freak over."
2,The Strokes really stroke one.,"After all the hype I expected to hear something amazing and magical. Unfortunately, this one fell a tad short. Quite possibly because of it's hype and the unfair label that has been put on them as ""The saviors of rock and roll"". Not even close, but if it had been just another album put out without so much expectations then it would've been a great consistent rocker. Although the lo-fi sound gets a little annoying. ""Last night"" is the best song on the album. A catchy tune with a classic rock and roll sound."
4,Is to NYC what Supergrass is to London,"A ton of hype is surrounding this NYC 5-piece. And with that has come the inevitable backlash. Bottom line: this a really, really good hook-filled rock record. Their influences are worn boldly on their sleeves (Television, Velvet Underground, Talking Heads) but so what? reminds me of another excellent and very promising debut by another young band with obvious influences: Supergrass. Yeah, I'll call them the Supergrass of New York City. Good stuff - can't wait to see how their music evolves on future releases."
4,"For god's sake, just enjoy it.","I doubt these guys are the saviors of rock and roll. However, the Strokes have been a breath of fresh air amid the TRL Britney/50 Cent/Justin music. Yes, it's all been done before...but if you are going to copy the style of a former band, why NOT sound like the Ramones, VU or the Clash? It's fun, it's energetic, and it beats the hell out of 98% of the crap you hear on the radio. So just enjoy it! It's a good CD."
3,WARNING: Vinyl track listing is incorrect,"The vinyl version contains ""New York City Cops"" instead of ""When It Started"", and this is not reflected in Amazon's track listing. This means the vinyl actually has the track listing of the European CD (with NYC cops) but the artwork of the American CD (the blue/yellow one). I wanted ""When It Started"" and I bought the album thinking that I would get it. It would have been a five star review otherwise, it's an excellent album."
1,fg,"people that would love this cd: A lil white girl who has no knowledge of what rock n' roll or musicianships are.people that hate this cd: guitarists, drummers, and bass players.the stroke is not rock music!!!!! so dont' put them under rock category. The tone of the rythm guitar is enough to make you wanna shoot somebody. the solos are made by an 8 year old playing guitar for the first week. the songs all have the same beat. it's ironic how these guys are rich, but the sound of the drums/guitars/keyboards are out of a midi player. the drums sounded like it came out of a circuit city casio keyboard. good lord!!! everything is just bad!to all the teenie popper who know nothing about music, this is heaven for you! :)to all those that appreciate talented musicians, skills, creativity, and SOUL, dont' buy this crap. i borrowed this cd from a friend due to the hype!like i said, this is not rock.listen to JIMI HENDRIX, steve vai, joe satrianni, yngwie malmsteen, tony mcalpine, led zepplin, etc."
2,BEWILDERED,ADMITTEDLY 2 EXCELLENT TRACKS BUT THE REST IS BARELY AVERAGE. I JUST DON'T GET THE HYPE SURROUNDING THIS MEDIOCRE RECORD - CONSIDERING THE MULTITUDE OF POSITIVE THINGS I HAD HEARD I REALLY PERSISTED BUT JUST DON'T HEAR ANYTHING OF INTEREST HERE . NO I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BORROWING FROM THE PAST OR RECYCLING OR OBVIOUS INFLUENCES OR WHATEVER - NEARLY ALL MUSIC GOOD OR BAD DOES IT TO SOME EXTENT. THERE IS SIMPLY JUST SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING MUSIC AROUND PAST AND PRESENT THAN THIS. DON'T BE FOOLED INTO BUYING THIS. MAYBE IT IS ME - EVERYONE ELSE SEEMS TO THINK IT IS GREAT.
3,if you like this youll love CONVOY,"I recently bought this record as a package deal with the new ""CONVOY"" record ""BLACK LICORICE"" And have to admit that the convoy record has occupied my cd player much more frequently than ""is this it"" Don't get me wrong I love the new strokes record too,but it gets a little tireing and the production of every song seems almost the same. ie: distorted vocals etc..I am very curious to see how the strokes will mature into their next record until then i'll be listening to more convoy."
2,Total Overhype!,"Don't get me wrong, their sound is very original and comes fresh compared to the overproduced bands nowadays. But there is WAY too much hype about these guys, I'm sure even the band itself will agree with me on that! I do like the back-to-the-roots snotty Rock attitude but what really bothers me is the overuse of the ""distorted voice"" effect. It's cool on Last Night but they use it on every single song on the album. It gets old, man!!"
2,Ouch,"I like keeping my reviews relatively short, ergo: Two words: Overrtaed. I suppose it was inevitable after the overwhelming hype they got from every possible angle. It's amazing how un-cool music can become when all we hear about is that this band marks the ""return of rock and roll."" Analogy: I once had a friend who weeks after being dumped by his girlfriend, kept telling me on a daily basis that he was finally over her. This went on for weeks, and his opinions on the matter were always unsolicited. Thankfully, it eventually stopped after some time. Afterwards, I had to point out that if you have repeatedly tell people that you're over someone, guess what, you aint over them. Same thing with this band. If every music critic and ""hip"" DJ in America have to say how spectacular and revolutionary they are, they just aren't all that spectacular..."
2,New Yaak Fashion Accessory,"Jingle jingle, jangle jangle, jingle jingle chord changes and some filtered trust fund moppy stickboy on the mic. Take it away please, heard it all before. Pass on this ridiculously hyped band and proceed to the source, namely the Velvets, who in their own way are also still riding the crest of a wave not so high or grand as reported. The strumming is all Lou. The Wedding Present, pushed along by a far more compelling singer, filtered this style with more charge, more urgency. When that rich boy starts whining on ""Barely Legal"", you're looking to pull the plug. Yes, a few catchy tunes -- and all ripped off. Female equivalent late night poseurs Elastica engaged in similar larceny. Find some real rock n' roll somewhere else."
1,Pretenders,"nothing more than a quick-fix that has subsequently lost any of the superficial, smarmy charm it momentarily held, is this it now seems tired, dessicated, effete, awfully ""studied"", cringe-inducing.julian casablancas' distorted singing voice is infantile and intolerably pretentious.ps why was this ever championed as ""the revival of rock""? apart from one or two numbers, there's nothing even vaguely ""rocking"" about it - for the most part it resembles the sort of hateful, half-baked tinny indie rock stuff that US colleges cooked up thru the mid-90s.awful."
3,Good but The vines are better,"This album is definetly good but the vines Highly Evolved isbetter. The Strokes songs sound basically the same but with thevines you hear the Beatles,Nirvana, The Sex Pistols and even a little bit of the Beach Boys. After all they were picked by critics as the future of rock. Musically and vocally the Vines are more talented but The Stokes are certainly part of the new rock revolution."
2,"Been there, done that","My friend told me how much he liked the Strokes because they brought back that old brit/new york style. I listened to the CD, and saw them in concert. They're talented enough guys. They know how to play their instruments well enough, but my problem is that I'm not really hearing anything original here. I've head all this before, and I've heard it done better. What's the point of buying a CD by a bunch of posers, when I can go out and get the better music by the artists that they are copying.Pick up some Stooges, Ramones, and Birthday Party rather than this cute but not groundbreaking CD."
4,Addictive but repetitive,"There are great songs on this album that will infect your brain. But, there is lots of filler on this album too. I can't wait to see what happens when they go from club scene act to an artistic rock and roll band. Watch out Radiohead if they make the transition."
2,overrated,"I don't believe much in this album. I find it overrated - but time might prove me wrong. I was expecting more energy, but I found the tunes flat and unimaginative. I was quickly bored with it. Nothing special to my mind, give me Ramones or some GOOD NY punk-rock anyday !!disappointing...The first tune has got a great bass line though, very catchy, and I give it a second star for that mainly - oh and also cause the guys have got wicked names and cool faces !!"
4,Strangely appealing,"Pleasantly surprised at how good it turned out to be. The premise of the novel is outlined by other reviewers, so I won't repeat it here. Some have criticized the plot for being too far-fetched, but I didn't find that to be a problem. What I liked most about the book was the way the author developed the characters; even though it's written in the third person, the reader feels as if the characters are speaking for themselves. It's not an easy thing to pull off, and the author does a good job of it. My biggest complaint about the book is her over-use of exclamation points, but once you get accustomed to it, you can sort of screen out their effect. The last couple chapters give the feeling that the author was ready to finish with the strangely appealing eccentrics who populate this novel, but even after you're finished, these are characters who will stay in your mind for a while."
5,An Intelligent Page-Turner!,"Taken In takes us on a roller-coaster ride of events which inalterably reconfigure the lives of a modern family. From Matt, the deeply spiritual teenage son of an agnostic father to Oren, the reclusive wealthy neighbor who sets in motion the odd and tragic series of events, the carefully drawn characters capture our interest and challenge us to guess what they will do next. Exploring the themes of random violence, self-sacrifice, and healing, Coyle delivers a delicious, meaty tale that the reader will savor long after turning the last page."
3,Three stars says it all,"A book by a writer whose reach exceeds her grasp. The characters often strain our belief, but the section about the aftermath of sudden death rings true. One should be grateful today for any book trying hard to be Literature. In a world of trash-everything [trash TV, trash books, trash publishing], this book represents the many that comprise a new-ish genre: demi-literature. I wish reviewers acknowledged the genre frankly and judged it honestly. Or maybe the genre has always been with us: trying hard, can't quite make it."
3,Not Wodehouse's funniest collection,"The Mulliner tales are mostly mildly entertaining. I usually laugh out loud at Wodehouse stories and re-read passages and whole books for joy at his use of language, but these stories don't have the same zing as other Wodehouse works. There a few cute ones with a few chuckles, but overall the stories feel tired."
3,it's ok,"I purchased this portable train so I didn't have to keep putting together the full size track, but I was a little disappointed with the piecess that you had to put in everytime they played with it. They would alwasy fall out really easily and mess up the track. The train itself worked good."
4,His best post A&M records period album!,"I think that Music Is Life is his best post A&M records album! The songs have better melody, rhythm and Jeffrey Osborne sounds so fabulous vocally. It helps that Jeffrey and another producer produced all of the songs, showing that he had more creative control. I like Caller ID, where he goes after the woman who is with another man by checking the messages on her phone answering machine to see if she is cheating on him. Another surprise is his remake of his former group LTD's Stranger and its familiar, famous NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA section that some R&B singers like R. Kelly have sung on their songs. The last album sounded too elevator music like, but Music Is Life is Jeffrey at his finest."
3,"Jeffrey Phenomenal, Orchestrations Wanting","I think Jeffrey pulls off ""Rest Of Our Lives"", ""Caller ID"" and ""Her Kisses"" but the rest of the CD is mediocre because the material doesn't match Jeffrey's excellent voice. I hope the producers of his next CD raise the bar material-wise to match Jeffrey's skillset."
2,A voice can't save every album,"Jeffrey Osborne is one of the finest voices that soul music has ever produced. However the longer his career has progressed, the production standards of his period with A&M; records have disappeared. 'Music is life,' is the first Osborne album that I have turned off mid-track. The reason was quite simple. Although there is no match to his voice, the orchestrations are cheap and tacky. 'Stranger,' was one of his strongest L.T.D. tracks, but the vocals could not disguise the instruments, that frankly could have been reproduced on one of those Casio hand-held organs that were around in the early 1980's.To kill off my disappointment, I pulled out an L.T.D. cd and went back to better days."
2,20th century techniques for use in the 21st century,"And, of course, attempting to use techniques honed and crafted in the 20th century, where the internet was, at best, a very late arrival, for 21st century use doesnt really work.Didn't really mind the Starbucks and Nike anecdotes; they broke up the rather dull principles. Worth reading once and probably not again."
3,I don't think this is the Best of Nuno.,"Nuno is one of the world's finest guitarist and I love his style; however, I don't think this release exhibits much of his guitar flash that I find in his other work. In short, if you're looking for his funky shred work on guitar, this isn't his best. It may be considered his best in other ways, I suppose."
5,love Supergirl,This version of Supergirl was a favorite of mine from her first apperence as the creation of an alternate Earths Lex Luthor
3,women fighters,"well done on how they became the best,the training they had,their determination they have what love they have for the martial arts,see them in action,some of the movies they played in.their ranks,the number of styles they know."
3,the ladies do protest,"This perports to be a view of some of the women in martial arts movies over the past thirty or so years. While some are interesting, most are not. The interview with Michelle Yeoh is a brief light in an otherwise dark space."
2,"Slow to inflate, cord length OK for a car - not long enough for a full size pick-up.","Works but is very slow. Cord is a bit shorter than other 12v inflation pumps I have used. The light is good. The case is a heavy duty box that I like but the latch on the case latches but does not lock down like other latches - I used some double sided Velcro above and below the latch and then a Velcro strip to go over the latch to keep it from opening. If they went to all the trouble to design such a potentially great product it would seem as though the manufacturer could have done a better job regarding the cord, the latch and most especially, the speed of inflation."
1,Crap,"This is one movie i could do without. if it wasn't for tony jaa, i would return it and get my dam money back. Its like a movie for idiots."
1,This is by far the worst ever!,"This is the worst ever, Too all who might be thinking of buying this please don't. This is my first review ever, I felt obligated to let everyone one know don't waste a dime on this movie. They should pay you to watch this video."
4,A Tale of Two Legends or The Legend of two Legends,"I own both CD versions of the music for Legend. Both Legendary composers, are very well suited to the film. The Tangerine Dream score, despite what others may say, DOES have a mystical quality to it, but it's a modern mystical element. Having seen the film with Tangerine Dream's airy, ambient score, my memory makes me seem to like this movie more with their version. The Goldsmith score, is defiintely one of his finest works, and fits equally, yet differently into the film. Thematic elements are more present in the classical scoring, but moods are set better in the Tangerine Dream version. I liken this score not as a competitive or 'lesser' soundtrack as some have dubbed it, but more akin to the same tale, told by two different authors."
4,Darker than Goldsmith,"This version of the Legend Soundtrack was chosen over the original Jerry Goldsmith one by Ridley Scott for release in the US. Both versions have shinning attributes to them although I am one of the minority that thinks the Tangerine Dream version is better. The feelings of eeriness and darkness coincide with the dark feelings of this movie better. If taken with the Jerry Goldsmith music, this movie feel candy coated, your atypical fairy tale... In the TG version the eeriness of the pan flutes at the beginning tune you into the fact that the fantasy movie you are about to watch is deeper and darker than those before. In the Goldsmith version I feel like I'm listening to watered down Enya, leading into Willow, or Lord of the Rings. I believe Ridley made the right decision with this music as it made it the darkness darker, and the moments of light more appreciated."
4,legend!,"Awesome! The sound is a little warped, a little, BUT for how old it is it is in very good condition and I am very happy with it. It arrived very quickly as well."
1,Absolutely horrible,I bought this for $80 thinking I was getting the alternate Jerry Goldsmith version. Really disappointed I didn't get the cool synthesizer version by that band Yes.
3,Where is the Missing Track?,"First off let me say that I love the movie Legend. The costumes, the make-up, everything was top notch. In a world where digital seems to be flooding the market it is refreshing to look back and see the stuff that dose not look like a glorified cartoon.On the subject of the soundtrack I must say that I was a little disapointed. The T.D. track at the very begining of the movie when the opening scrypt was rolling, seems to be missing from the soundtrack. I enjoyed the other music, but was very bummed out when I bought the sound track and discoverd this was missing. If anyone knows where I can find this missing Track It would be appreciated.I do reccomend the Sound track as is although it is incomplete."
5,Excellent,"This fine recording presents the second set of Sonatas from Corelli's opus 5 with baroque recorder taking the solo line. The transcriptions work well musically and within the musical-historical context, given they are based on contemporary transcriptions. The ornaments and runs supplied Jean-Pierre Nicolas on his alto and voice recorders are thrilling and tastefully executed and the ensemble works well and sounds good behind him. Nicolas' sound is just what you'd want from a recorderist, and its worth hearing the warm tone of the voice-recorder. The theorbist, Yasunori Imamura adds delighful colour to the basso continuo part, although I wondered at his reluctance to ever use the bass diapasons, even in final chords or cadences.Overall well worth the low price if you enjoy Corelli and the gorgeous sound of the baroque flute/recorder."
5,Kristina's Review,"This CD is magical, and for individuals of all ages to enjoy. It is very much eclectic. I am in awe of the cultural aspects of it, as well as the English style music I have had more exposure to. My favorite song on the CD isn't even it the sample songs, and it is absolutely amazing. This CD warms one's heart and kindles one's spirit. It shows the beautiful inner-soul of innocence, provides hope, and has a bit of magic. If you don't have the movie, either, it's a must have! I adore it!"
4,Make a mantra and get going...,"If someone wants to be an entrepreneur, then this book is a must read. The GIST of the book is make meaning, make mantra and get going. Guy Kawasaki, the author, says do not keep on planning but take action.One interesting aspect in each of the chapters was an exercise to try out the methodology described in the chapter."
2,"Limited value, for a limited audience","As others have said, this is not a guide to ""starting anything."" It's a guide (using that term loosly) to getting VC funding for your ""hot"" ""innovative"" ""high growth potential"" Silicon Valley startup, and to growing that company in its early stages. There might be some good tidbits in here if that's actually you. And if you're planning something else, it's certainly worth thinking hard about whether the ""lean startup"" approach (as presented here by Kawasaki and elsewhere by many others) can be helpful. Much of the content is highly superficial, and it gets pretty tiresome to read over and over again about the example of the Macintosh launch -- especially given that Kawasaki doesn't even explain what exactly was his role in that effort, and given that the Mac launch seems, based on what he describes in the book, to be the only real, big success of his career."
3,Should read if a start-up,"If you are starting a company or work for a start-up, then this is worh the read for inspiration and a flavor of the start-up world.I don't classify the author as a real expert on eveything he writes about, but there's enough useful data to keep your interest. Probably useful data, although he doesn't really have the experience in what he's writing about."
4,The Art of the Start,"Short and readable book that discusses some of the things you need to think about when doing a start-up. There is a lot of stuff on how to pitch your project to venture capitalists -- including what font sizes to use :-) I can't really judge the value of most of this (yet), but I'd still recommend this book to anyone who is considering doing a start-up (before going into more detailed books)."
5,Best Start Up Book Hands Down,"I read this book after I had built and sold my first business! If only I had known about it before! It was so practical and addresses issues and pitfalls that entrepreneurs get stuck in. Fun and clever, always practical- great book!"
2,"Curious at first, then disenchanted","Kawasaki does offer a framework for those seeking funding, but other than that, it offers very little for real boot-strapped start-ups seeking to innovate.As an aside, the reader is left wondering if Kawaski made his fortune from writing books about making money, rather than really having a method. And if he did have a real method, he's not sharing it here because I didn't learn much from reading this book."
3,OK biz book,"In my opinion, not as good as the other books by Mr. Kawasaki.Still ok, but not my best purchase.It was harder to read than his other books and I learned less from it."
2,Hand butter was dry and hard,I bought this for myself and as a gift as I really like Fruits & Passion but this hand butter felt dry & hard. I had to dig my finger in to get some out and it didn't make my hand all that soft. I threw it out after a few months as it was laying in my drawer collecting dust.
5,Christopher Columbus The Discovery,"We took a new and different vacation this spring. It was our soto speak Discovery. We decided on a VOYAGE of DISCOVERY...and what aVoyage it was! Every night the sails abounded in thier glory, and Captain Uli Pruesse played the soundtract from Columbus Discovery on the PA...and talked motivational and stirring trivia about sailing and leaving your worries behind...""find every ripple in the seas, and forget the hectic life behind...This is it! This is it! You are sailing now..."" It ran goose bumps and brought tears to the strong... Thus my review is carrying baggage of the perfect sailing voyage...and Uli Pruesse brought a child back to my thoughts...a child I am glad is still alive! The music Columbus Discovery fit well! I will always associate the music with sunsets on golden seas and this German born motivational seaman...Captain Uli!"
4,"Easy to Set Up and Use, Works Great!",This flash can be set up in minutes to work with any point and shoot and even Digital SLR camera. It has a powerful enough flash to fill a room 15 feed deep and the light is very uniform. Worth every penny. The flash unit is made out of plastic and it seems it might get fairly damaged if dropped a few times. It is an overall better buy than the Canon DHC1 though since this flash accepts rechargeable AAA batteries.
2,Not Good as a Slave Flash,Ordered this Metz unit as a slave flash but the fold down base is more ideal for an on camera flash than it is for setting up an off unit slave. The fold down base makes it very awkward to mount to a tripod. I would not order this unit as an off camera slave flash.
5,The coolest book on Fitness,"If you are a gym enthusiast, make sure you get this book. It is a great help for fitness and body building. I won Mr West Virginia and the book was one of the reasons I reached my goal. Go for it Now!"
5,One of the greatest Catholic books of our time,"Dr. Scott Hahn is one of the very best minds in the Catholic Church today, and a very fine writer and speaker. ""The Lamb's Supper"" is superb; indeed, it is one of the greatest Catholic books of our time. He is a truly great teacher. At the Christendom College summer program in 2000 he gave what was literally the finest lecture I have ever heard in my life -- and I have heard some great ones. Everyone should get every book and tape of his that they can afford."
5,A Very Interesting Book,"Scott Hahn does an outstanding job in this book. In looking at the Mass from the perspective of the Apocalypse, Hahn makes the Mass more understandable."
5,Revelation is not what you may think - this book explains!,"I've always felt that the book of Revelation was not a story of things to come, but of a history of things that had already occurred. This incredible book affirms my gut instincts, but it also explains in detail some of the most wonderful mysteries of the Eucharist. Did you know that ""apololypse"" translated from Greek means ""unveiling""? That simple fact is crucial in understanding this enigmatic letter to the churches. A MUST read for all who are interested in the Truth!"
5,Great book,This book is great and everyone should read it. If your Catholic it will open your eyes to the Mass and you will LOVE going to church. If your not Catholic you just might want to be after you read this book!
3,Glee - great! Discosis? Dull.,"I loved Glee - thought it was one of the most exciting, quirky and fun albums to come along for a long time. I thought the way the crew shifted from slacker pop to dancefloor to faux-harcore rap to folk was brilliant. I'd hoped for more of the same from Discosis.Nope. Discosis is diverse - it's got everyone from Eek-A-Mouse to Curtis Mayfield to Youssou N'Dour on it - but everything is united by a dancefloor beat and slick production. The end result - you can throw it on your stereo and crank up a pretty good party, but it won't surprise you. The charming, odd moments of Glee are absent altogether, and so's much of the appeal. If you liked the dancier stuff on Glee, you may well love Discosis. If, instead, you enjoyed the acoustic cover of Come On Feel the Noise, skip this one."
1,Save Your Money: Doesn't Detect Radar Guns,"As another reviewer stated, the Whistler XTR-140 does not work for radar guns. Detects everything else: portable road signs, store alarms, and UNMANNED ""This is your speed"" signs.If you're going to buy a radar detector, spend it on an Escort Redline."
5,Amazing cost/performance detector,"I was extremely skeptical about the performance of a $40 detector, but after a few recent road trips, I am convinced this is actually a well functioning product. Although it does not have exceptional filtering ability for false signals, it can still give you enough X/K/Ka warning for you to slow down in time.The two blue LED's are a great innovation, because you can easily see them out of the corner of your eye. This is extremely useful when your radio drowns out the audible signals, or when the sun washes out the primary letter warning lights.You simply can't go wrong with the price. It does not have the features of the top of the line detectors (coiled power cord, voice alert, text readout, settings save, compass, etc), yet it has at its core the most important feature: the basic detection ability to provide enough warning for the driver."
2,One thing not so good,One of the alerts sets off blue lights on the device. My husband wasn't happy with this feature. He has had to put tape over it because it's risky to have blue lights going off in your car. Worth less than we paid :-(.
2,Garbage,"Okay I understand this is a cheap radar detector so I didnt expect it to be as good or strong as other radar detectors but mines was garbage. It was $40 when I brought it, funny how it didn't double on quality or increase at all actually but now it is a $80 unit. Okay first day hooked it up and everything was good. Didnt give me as far ahead of a warning as more expensive detectors but that was expected. Than I noticed my radar detector wasnt going off as cops passed me. Read the manual checked and tried all the settings nothing. Now where I am there is a radar speedometer like thing that always set this thing off. After a little less than a month of use I'd drive pass it and the machine did nothing. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Already 2 tickets,"A very good device, detects all bands and laser, but practically useless against laser guns.Also most cops use laser guns, Already got 2 tickets because i relied too much on the radar."
3,"Good price, okay detection","This detector is great for the price. The only small complaints I have is the fact that it goes off randomly all the time, which isn't that big of a deal, but 90% of the time this detector goes off, its something random, so after a while you stop paying attention to the alerts. It picks cops up from a pretty far distance, but sometimes they sneak up real close before it goes off. The thing is also VERY clunky looking, its flat bottomed, which is kind of weird sitting up in the air on the glass, but whatever. It works, and its cheap, and thats all it needs to be. Sure you could spend 300-500 bucks on a detector, but your not going to be saving yourself any money on speeding tickets then."
5,Great for the money!!!,"I purchased this to replace a 10 year old unit that was stolen, and it works very well. Way better than the older one I paid much more for. Blue LED's are a nice touch, clearly visible even in mid-day. Picks up radar/laser in more than enough time to slow down. Don't know why there are so many complaints about that cause it works great for me.Well worth the $$. Buy it!!"
1,Terrible product,"Very crappy product, went off at times in the middle of the desert when nothing was there."
1,whistler XTR-140 Laser/Radar Detector with Exclusive Twin Alert Periscope,I dont like it the police is next to you and the thing never goes off I suggest that no ever buy this.
5,Excellent Radar Detector!!!,I was skeptical because of the price but the reviews are accurate. This radar detector has paid for itself already. It's not the top of the line detector but it gets the job done.
3,Good For The Price,The Whistler is good for the price you pay. I'd consider using this as a beginner detector but if you want the real deal try upgrading and paying the extra money for all the great features more expensives ones yield. It misses a few alarms and there are two blue flashing lights on top of it that could alert police to the device (even if it's legal).
1,Horrible - Does Not Work!,"I can't tell you how many times I've driven by cops aiming their radar guns right at me and this thing didn't make a peep! It does NOT work! Oh sorry, it worked once but by the time it went off I had already seen the cop. I bought it because some of the other reviewers said it works great, but do not believe them! All it does is go off when you drive near stores with automatic doors (because they work by radar). It took me awhile to test it out and now I am past the return date so I cannot return it. What a waste of money."
2,"""IF YOU'RE IN NEED OF AN AUTOMATIC DOOR FINDER""",PASSED COP AFTER COP ON THE HIGHWAY & CITY WITH NO ALARM BEING SET OFF ON THIS RADAR DETECTOR..!WORKS WELL FINDING AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCATIONS LIKE WALMART AND OTHER RETAIL STORES...!SOON TOO BE ON ITS WAY BACK TO THE SELLER...!
2,it's just meh...,"I bought this ""radar detector"" a few days ago and I already returned it to amazon and here's why: I passed over 8 cop cars with it in my car on freeway and it never alert me or anything! i was lucky I didn't get any tickets. sure it does notify you when there is a stationary radar at an intersection (the reason I gave it 2 stars), but it does NOT do anything when there are cops around. apparently, you car has to be directly targeted by a laser gun for this detector to go off, which basically makes it useless. it's like ""let me know when I'm already getting a ticket.""I personally suggest you to stay away from this detector, save more money, and buy a good one that actually notifies you when there are cops around."
1,Don't Waste your Time,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this as a gift for my brother. I was so embarrassed when he told me that it only works when a cop is a few feet away. I was not able to return the item because he didn't want to tell me that it was worthless.I would not recommend this item to anyone. Save your money and purchase a better item."
2,Expiration,The product is great but unfortunately it doesn't last long...I bought mines in February of 2011 and it stop working May 12 2012 so basically you'll get a little more than a year out of it which sucks...So basically if you only need it for a short period of time and don't care to have any longer then it's a great product...There's no warranty beyond a little over 30 days.
2,get the next model up,"does not save the last setting it sucks i always have to set the city/hway every time i get on the car, go to the next model up i got it on my other car and it works like a charm"
5,"Works great, but...","This is the first Laser/Radar detector I ever owned. I bought it because I always wanted one but they were too pricey for my pocket book. I waited years until finally now many types can be had for under $50. This Whistler XTR-140 has all the bells and whistles (excuse the pun) you can use. It's a duzzy and works just fine. But,... and here's the rub... seems I've waited too long because I found out that radar detectors have had their day... they are almost rendered obsolete what with modern pulse laser and radar targeting systems that, in the blink of an eye, have pin-point accuracy and photo-capture capability that many police departments now possess. I even wrote the manufacturer about this and they admitted there's not much you can do to counter such stealthy detection... split second targeting and your caught. Their suggestion? Get behind another vehicle and hope they get caught before you! Ha. I don't need a radar detector for that!"
1,Switch is way too hard to slide.,"I can operate it, but the lady I bought it for cannot. Too much pressure needed to slide the switch and ignite it. That's probably the ""child resistant"" feature (there is no extra button or switch that must be pushed to use it). Also it ships without fuel."
2,Not what I expected,When this lighter came the first time I filled it with fuel and it never once worked. I had to return it for a new one and even the new one work roughly 60% of the time. It's clearly made of cheap plastic and components. Not what I was expecting at all.
2,Works but not Happy,"Tried it today July 2008 and after reading the comments (which I didn't when I purchased it) I agree with most of the posters. The price was good, looked nice, can extend the snout .5 to 2.75"", runs on butane (like most cig lighters). This is great for reaching into a fireplace, BBQ or down into a glass to light a candle, kinda a replacement for the LONG Fireplace matches. However, there is NO FUEL in the lighter so you gotta purchase a can of butane with an adapter made for lighters (not the Butane for camp stoves). This web page needs to say ""this lighter will require filling with Butane and thumb muscles before you can use it"". The slide switch is way to hard to slide. I can do it but a smaller person or elderly will have trouble. Now that I have filled it I will say it lights every time. Cons: Takes a strong thumb to operate and arrives empty. Next time I'll read the comments before purchasing anything."
1,Looks nice Works little,Bought a 3 pack at Costco a while back. Thought it was a good deal with the ability to refill and the adjustable neck. Turns out to be junk. Worked maybe 2 refills and stops lighting. Very flimsy construction. Don't waste your money.
2,HURTS YOUR THUMB,This would be a good product if the SLIDE WAS NOT SO HARD TO PUSH. A couple of pushes and your thumb skin starts to hurt under your thumb-nail.
1,didn't get the product nor any response from the vendor. terrible service!,I ordered the product in advance as needed it till a specific date. the product didn't arrive within few weeks and when i tried to contact the vendor there was no response. after few weeks of waiting i had to cancel the order.i have not heard from the vendor till today and i'm very disappointed from this low level of service.
4,Excellent historical review of hypnosis,Waterfield is clearly an extremely talented researcher and does a terrific job telling the story of hypnosis. The chapter on Mesmer is fascinating. Waterfield does an excellent job offering a variety of perspectives although he does offer his opinions at times. I found this to a be a very balanced view of hypnosis covering it from a variety of angles. Waterfield did an excellent job researching the history of hypnosis and sharing his findings with the reader.
3,Ok mic but may need some fixin.,I bought this Mic and it worked for about a month. The Push to Talk still works but it makes a very scratchy sound. Before it quit working properly I convinced my buddy to buy the same one. Now he has the same problem. I'm sure Astatic would replace the mike but I hate dealing with this kind of crap. Pic a different power mike this one is a POS.Ok I was able to open up the Mic and clean out the PTT with electrical contact cleaner. It has been working great for about a month. I was able to fix my buddie's one too! I'll give it three stars since it works well now after I had to do some home repairs.
3,good try for a first US album,"A good effort is made towards making a debut album in US by this talented Japanese singer/song writer. Utada needs a hit song in order to carry an album to the top of the charts. There are many experiementations so to speak on this album. I think Utada is better off selecting one genre instead of producing hoge-poge diskettes. She is willing to push the limits in her singing ability which is commendable. If you hear her hit song ""First Love"" in her previous albums you will know how she has evolved over the years."
3,Good but could have done better,I love Utada and everything but I think she should have stay in Japan and made the good music she use to. I'm not saying that it sucked because Utada could never suck cause I love her too much. This CD was O.K. I've been a big fan of her japanese style of music so I know what kind of music she can make. I think she really should have stuck with her own kind of music. I got the CD because I heard the song Easy Breezy and liked her other songs in japanese. I thought it would be a good album but it wasn't as good as I thought it was. I think that when she came to america to she tryed to change the music to fit the american style of music and didn't quiet make it. Utada I love you and I like this album a little bit but don't ever make a album like this again. Stick with what you know. I would love for her to come back and make another english ablum but the way her made her other music.
2,"go back to japanese, utada","I've heard a couple tracks from her new album and they are nothing compared to her Japanese albums. Just like Shakira, she sounds better in her native language. In ""Easy Breezy"" she sounds so much worst than before. Personally, I recommend one of her first 2 CDs in Japanese. Even if you don't speak Japanese (I surely don't) it's worth a try, I have one of them myself.Also, why only Utada now? Why not Utada Hikaru anymore? What's up with this?!"
1,im sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!,"im sorry for the people who did not know about utada and they had to be introduced to her with this crap cause her japanese stuff is great but this is horrible .She has like 10 sounds on this disc,horrible!"
4,Utada,"I listend to this cd and all I could think of was ""wow"". I absolutely love it! The songs get stuck in my head; they are so catchy and just fun to litsen to."
5,Like no other!,"No, Utada is NOT some wannabe from another country. Actually, she's from New York. If you're familiar with Japanese popular music, but maybe not with Utada, she transcends the rest. She doesn't have some funky accent while singing words she can barely understand...No, because she produced most of the songs on this CD by herself!No matter what kind of music you prefer, dance, hip hop, whatever, I'm sure you'll enjoy this CD! Her blending of various musical styles and originality creates unique flavor of music that will appeal to anyone!"
4,Utada Rocks,"This cd is great. If you loved her singing in japanese than you will love this album it has hot songs and cool beats. Utada keeps it real with song like ""The Workout"" and ""Easy Breezy""This Manhattan born j pop singer has real spirt and voice. If you like j-pop,pop,or a mix of the two with a little hip hop then this is for you. Any fan of Utada should also pick up this album"
5,This does the job,"I looked every where for a cleaner of my Sony camcorder and the prices stopped me from buying so as usuall I came to Amazon.com and there was this JVC lens cleaner for a fraction of the price any where else. It does what it says, cleans the lens and it is very easy to use. I would recommend this to everyone."
1,Ruins cameras,"The camera, a SONY DVD camcorder, had a code for a dirty lens. I bought this product and used it and then the camera would not even access the disc like it did before. Now the camera is in worse shape then it was before. This is a piece of garbage. Do not buy it."
1,disappointed,The item never arrived. I contacted the seller the last day of expected arrival and he told me he would refund my purchase and send me another copy which would arrive in the next week. The copy never arrived. I haven't seen the refund yet (it's been about 10 days). I'm disappointed; they were very nice email exchanges.
3,I wouldn't buy it again.,"This is a nice, big puzzle with large pieces. The thing I mainly don't like is that only a few of the pieces are jigsaw-type (interlocking), the majority are just slide-together. This is very frustrating to my two children because the puzzle is always moving around and the pieces constantly have to be repositioned. I wish the country names had been included, but it's also nice to keep it simple for the very young child who just might want to learn the continents. I paid a lot more for this puzzle than what is being asked here, and I would not buy it again. Melissa and Doug also makes a wooden world map puzzle, which might be better."
2,Scanner only works on low res,I have this one and the scanner only works for doc. The printer stops working if I try to scan a photo.
1,An old and primitive book...,waist of money... a very old looking and not updated book with b/w bad quality photo examples and charts... better buy Hedgecoe's books...
2,Dumbed Down Version of Original Series,"Having bought, read, and studied Adam's original series, the revised edition is a dumbed-down version for the modern audience. Though the newer books are good for beginners, they lack depth, detail and insights into serious B/W photography. Okay for the beginner, but find copies of the old editions if you are serious about your photography."
4,Man - '1999 Party / Twang Dynasty' (Voiceprint),"Nicely done 2-CD reissue of two of Man's lengthy repertoire. First, there's the archive '1999 Party' which is a superb audio document of Man's 1974 U.S. tour when they were support band for Hawkwind and 1998's Twang Dynasty', their first studio album in umteen years. To name just a couple of the tunes off this later Man effort that managed to stick out in my mind were the jamming ""Mad On Her"" and ""Fast And Dangerous""."
2,Jewel?,"Did Jewel hit her head or something between the last album and this new release? Where are those soulful, thoughtful tunes that many of us enjoy from Miss Kilcher? Could it be that she's trying to appeal to a younger audience? Jewel, drop the Britney Speers act! You're far too intelligent and talented. Peace y'all."
1,"Conceded, Cliched, ...","Why does our local radio station subject our listeners to ""Standing Still"" 5 or 6 times a day? One day, it's going to be played one to many times and make someone drive into oncoming freeway traffic. ""Burning Bush"", ""Do You, Need Me, Like I Needed You""? The lyrics are the epidemy of weakness and cliche. I watched her interview on Muchmusic last month. WOW! Can you be any more conceded and full of yourself. I still can't figure out why anyone would think she has talent. ... Jewel is by far the most overrated musician on the scene today..."
4,Jewel lets go on 'This Way',"Jewel is folk/rock's most influential ingenue. Since her sparkling 1995 debut Pieces of You she has ruled the roost of the artsy and easy listening scenes. 2001's This Way proves that this singer-songwriter definitely is trying to go for a more mass media crowd, but don't expect that to distance her from her living-in-a-van-by-the-beach days. Sure, opening track ""Standing Still"" is as radio-friendly as almost anything Britney Spears puts out and even includes some drum programming on the bridge, but Jewel's way with words and angelic protean soprano slides ambly through the poppy quirks. The best example of her sound is in ""I Won't Walk Away,"" a heart-wrenching ballad about finding the right person and staying with them forever. A handful of other songs are decent, including ""This Way,"" but in the end it is the standout hit-singles (such as the aforementioned ""Standing Still"") that makes This Way purchase-worthy. Jewel's best album, by far."
4,Nice!,"I enjoy this CD. I think I like Jewel because she has a great voice and a talent for creating nice-sound melodies. I can take only so much of her lighter sounding songs (Indigo Girls-like), though; I prefer her to be a bit more rocking which she does on a couple tracks...reminding me somewhat of the songs on Joan Osborne's rocking Righteous Love CD (the best album of last year, by the way). This album impresses - I like the harder rocking moments the best."
2,What happened?,"This album was a big disappointment for me. It lacks the raw sound of that Alaskan girl who played in coffee houses with just her acoustic guitar. Popular music is not bad, but I always expected something more from Jewel's earthy tones. The sound is so manufactured compared to her first two albums. This album many appeal to pop culture much more than her previous works, but it may disappoint many of Jewel's fans."
4,The New Jewel,"I was at first ambivelent about buying the cd because I didn't like that there was a song called Jesus Loves You. I was happy to find out it wasn't a preachy song.The new CD is good, however it is a vast departure from the Jewel I came to know and love. Jewel is creative and has a fantastic voice. I loved her first cd, Pieces of You. It was quirky and acoustic, which I love. I have to say, that when I first started listening to this cd, I thought, Damn, I miss the old Jewel.There is no doubt that the music on this cd is very good, but I liked that Jewel was unique. She's really gone toward the mainstream with This Way. But her mainstream is very good, and I like it.I was getting over my feelings of missing the old Jewel, untill I heard the last two bonus tracks. I have to say that Sometimes It Be That Way is probably my favorite track."
5,most impressive,"I'll be honest, I like everything Jewel does. There are some genuine gems on there, things Jewel never did before. Like 'The New Wild West' where the dramatic music flows over into a computery sound. There's also the regular Jewel/guitar combos but not as many as in earlier years. It's very clear that she keeps on stretching her musical abilities. The songs are just earbleedin' beautiful or are so beautifully sung that you just can't help loving this album. It's a very consistent, listenable whole.And it has a booklet in which she explains why she wrote certain songs (and some beautiful pics of cource :)). A word for the fans etc. It's a really personal piece of work."
3,A bit too country-not quite the Jewel I know,"I've been a Jewel fan for years, starting with the release of ""Pieces of You"". Since then, I've really come to love Jewel's slow, sometimes sad and mournful tunes, and her expressive lyrics. Of course, I bought ""This Way"" shortly after it hit the stores but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. Everyone is saying that her song 'Cleveland' is too country, but for me, alot of the songs had too much of a country, bluegrass twang, including 'Till we Run out of Road', 'Everybody Needs Someone Sometime', and 'The New Wild West'. And I'm just naming a few. Overall, there's not much of the ""old"" Jewel on this CD and so it seems that it will appeal most to people who prefer pop-rock and country, rather than those who liked the music on ""Pieces of You"" and ""Spirit""."
4,Worth a chance!!!!,"I have to admit i've become a Jewel fan a little late in the game! I recently went to see Jewel at the Symphony hall in Birmingham, and seriously thought she was fantastic!! A little rocky at first due to technical problems i think but as soon as she got going, well ""The New Wild West"" Rocks! I've now bought about four of her albums.[P]eople have said that Jewel is trying to express to much in her music that she gloss' over the serious parts of life! Do we really wanna hear about all the bad things we just wanna sit down and listen to some good music right. Yeh, ok some of her songs can sound a bit similar to each other; but i think the benefit of the doubt is in order! People like Britney and Kylie are ok; but how ofen do you find someone other than Alanis Morrisette, that can write songs, play them amazingly on the guitar and belt out some bloody good vocal cords at the same time!She plays the guitar like a dream and anyone who can strum like that is good in my books!!!!"
5,One of the year's most sophisticated CDs,"This is the first Jewel album I have listened to, so I don't have her history to go by, other than what I have heard on the radio. I like what I have heard in the past, yet because of the high volume of airplay, I haven't purchased before. When I heard the first song play on the radio, I had to have it. I have not been disappointed. This is an incredibly sophisticated compilation from an ever increasingly talented women. She has several different vocal styles, using all of them with ease. Her lyrics are also worth listening to, and I can only imagine how much better she will get over time. The sound engineering is very good as well, and that always helps to make a classic you like to listen to for years to come. The more you listen the more you like it."
1,Sansung t809 Car Charger,"This item broke my cell phone. I had to buy a new cell phone. It worked fine in the car but when I had to re-charge using the wall charger, the wall chargaer wouldn't work. Then when I tried to use the cell charger after trying to use the wall charger... it didnt work any more.So... instead of saving money, this cost more money. It ruined the inside connections in my cell phone.I would rate this item as -0- stars... don't buy!!!!!"
4,Religious art,A very comprehensive guide to Rococo religious art. For those of us who love churches :-)
5,"Aunque no esta respaldada por un autor famoso,","¡YA QUISIERAN MUCHOS ESCRITORES DE BEST SELLERS IGUALAR LA CALIDAD DE ESTA NOVELA !Muy bien escrita, real, dolorosa, IMPRESCINDIBLE PARA LOS ADOLESCENTES QUE DUDAN QUE EXISTAN ESTAS TRAMPAS dolorosas que les tiende la vida...Para los adultos, eso nada más:UNA NOVELA DE LA MAS ALTA CALIDAD"
5,A superlative work,"I read a lot of baseball lit, and 1964 by David Halberstam is in rareified air, looking into the players on an intimate level rarely seen in accounts of the game and how it was played in the 1960s. All of it accounted with the riveting writing of Halberstam."
2,Save your Money,"Save your money!The first one ordered, lasted a couple of weeks. Amazon replaced it NO questions asked. The second one lasted a bit longer, but not having saved the original packing,ended up throwing it on the shelf for future garbage trip.Great idea,but, save yourself the grief, and the money.T.M.WilliamsIowa"
2,Spring Clamp Too Small,"I LOVE the idea of the light with flexible neck but was disappointed when I couldn't get the clamp to fit anywhere on the grill. I measured before I purchased it and it should have worked but it didn't. If the clamp would have opened up another 1/8 of an inch it would have fit. Because it was a early Father's Day gift to my husband, he made the best of it and attached it to a chair that we slid up next to the grill instead of sending it back. He didn't want to hurt the kids feelings. A word to the wise....great gift idea...but, make sure your grill tray is less then an inch thick....3/4"" much better....ours was 1"" exactly."
1,very poor quality,I have now purchased 2 of these and both worked when I first turned them on and the next time I tried them they did not work. I am now sending the 2nd one back
4,Therapy for the mind and body,"This was a gift I purchased and the reciever has used it well, being a good therapy for the mind and body in what can be a daily struggle in living with Fibro."
5,Very helpful for people with fibro and chronic fatigue,I did find this CD helpful. At times I've even fallen asleep before it's finished while listening to it before going to bed. The author's voice is soothing and calming. She talks you through the process of relaxing your body and concentrating on letting the pain go. You can listen to it at any time of the day when the pain becomes unbearable.
4,there is an updated verison,"because online games such as these change on a regular basis, this particular book is out of date as a newer version has been issued. also since there is another expansion for teh final fantasy 11 game called Chains of Permathia, another version, probably called fall 2004 will probably be released soon."
2,What guide?,"First off I don't want to sound unreasonable....that being said...this guide pretty much sux. In truth, the come-with documentation for the game sucked even more but this is supposed to be a guide. I know there is a TON of information to deal with in this game and to put all of it together would leave you with something resembling War & Peace but this guide is all but useless, especially at higher levels.If you're looking for a cursory overview of the game and its concepts AND you have some cash to burn than pick it up. If you are looking for anything approaching an in depth catalog of creatures or items or quests than this will leave YOU feeling burned. The maps are helpful for sure and for a newb this guide may help for a while but in the end you will find yourself frantically flipping thru pages looking for info that's just not there. My question is ""Will anyone be doing a proper FF XI guide""?"
2,Not very good...,"If it was possible, I'd recommend tearing the book in half: throw the first half away and keep the last half. The last half of the book is very informative and contains information about the different areas in the game, weapons, quests, and missions.However, the first part of the book is laid out horribly. The section about your first day really has very little to do with what you will actually do in the game on your first day. The various sections about the player jobs are poorly written, lack detail, and are obviously padded. You're better off just reading the game manual.If you're looking for a guide that will offer some insight into the game, this isn't it. However, if you're looking for a resource or reference book on armor, weapons, quests, and missions, then you might not mind the cover price... just ignore the first half of the book."
4,Final Fantasy online helper,"Gives good information, but disappointed there aren't better details on objects."
4,kinyo speakers a good deal for low budget,This little thing costs almost nothing and you can get your usage out of it. I had one velcroed to my dash board as my stereo system had been stolen. After about six months of hard core use and lousy care it finally started to not work so well. I went to toys'r'us where I bought my kinyo. They were out and were selling another brand. That one didn't work half as well. Six dollars for music on the go is worth it.
2,That's it?,"Pretty boring. Body is squishy and rubbery and any lint, fuzz or dog hair sticks to it. Only a few different ways to position him with the little accessories. After a few minutes, the kids are done. Has to lie down because it won't stand up. We gave it away because my kids didn't play with it and wanted somebody else to have it. They had a friend who always took it off our shelf when he came over to play so we sent him home with it."
2,Looks Great Is Great But Beware of Many Headaches,"This gateway is everything you imagined and more. As long as you take a couple advils, you might be fine. A couple of things to watch out for, you must have a high speed internet. The computer will go crazy on you if you lose connection or your modem or hub acts funny. Within the second day, I witness the blue screen of death. Second the YES network doesnt' work, they must be mets fans. Also, customer support was terrible, they told me to shutt off my machine and run a wizard to correct my problem, and then THEY HUNG UP ON ME! I don't think Windows XP technology is ready quite yet. Also, the great dvd burner and cd drive is LOUD, very annoying. We returned this great system, just give it time, because it is a dream system to have. You can really record your own dvds so create your own dvd series of such great shows."
5,Brilliant and evocative songwriting!,"Sarah Kim Wilde's album is one of the most haunting, soulful and poetic collections of music I've ever heard. Cannot get her songs out of my head! Thanks for the great music!"
5,Great front or back yard light from Amazon,"I bought the outdoor lamp without the planter at the bottom - It is over 6 feet tall and looks great.The instructions on putting it together were less than perfect, but logic and past experience with lamps got it together in over an hour.I do recommend this electric outdoor lamp."
5,100 Questions That Non-Members Ask About Unitarian Universalism,"I liked this book because all of my questions were addressed throughly, and it was an easy read. The price was also great."
2,New smaller-sized cans mean new (not improved) formula,"My 5 cats use to inhale this food. A few months ago I noticed the cans were no longer 6 ounces (they are now smaller and flatter) and my cats refuse to eat any of it. One of them initially ate a bit of it but then refused to go anywhere near his bowl. I use to purchase this flavor, as well as the organic turkey & turkey liver and the chicken & mackerel but not any more. I also read a review on another pet food site that some people found corn hulls in their by nature organic cat food, which to me was the final straw. Better safe than sorry when it comes to my felines' health."
2,My brain hurts,While there was some good information here I was personally left with the feeling that the author was trying prove he has the IQ of a rocket scientist. A decent read if you want to read everything on the subject otherwise I would recommend something else. Sometimes less is more.
3,Not Water's best,"Dirty is an ok movie. It's shocking and fun, but it lacks Water's touch. In the end it just turns out to be a large scat/sexual joke, that hardly makes you last."
3,"Meh, lukewarm at best","I love John Waters, I've had the privilage of seeing him in on his lecture tour and he is absolutely hysterical and has people rolling in the aisles wherever he goes. His latest effort, however, was rather disappointing. It starts off with a lot of promise, but it fell flat because it seems like they were trying too hard.I gave it 3 stars because I also loved the soundtrack, Chris Isaac is a truly under appreciated talent, and Johnny Knoxville had merits and was able to rise above being the star of JackAss. There were a few funny moments when she started meeting in secret with the sex addicts and the sexaholics group therapy sessions. Otherwise, Tracy Ullman in the Divine role was overacting and Selma with the giant breasts was too obvious."
3,Very enjoyable,"I'm not terribly familiar with John Waters' work. I once caught Cry Baby on TV and watched it for a while just because it was so interestingly odd. Dirty Shame is no exception...but far more watchable. I don't care what the other reviews say, this is not mainstream. It's odd, original, and has plenty of laughs throughout. While this film isn't ever going to be considered a classic, or played every month on TV like Back to the Future, nor am I going to go out and buy a copy, it's just a good fun loving movie...not great...not bad...just fun."
3,Worth a watch,Something tells me John Waters only referenced the Bear community to have the community watch it and then show it as more bizarre than it already is. It sure got guys in my metro to pack the indy cinemas!
1,Bad Bad Horrible Beyond Redemption Wrong,"John Waters the joke is over. Your movies do not shock us anymore nor do the unplesantries that pop up in your outdated newest installment. Stop while you were ahead, please."
5,"Waters, Ulman, Knoxville, and the Mink in Fine Form!","What if your hit over the head and become a sex addict?? Well hit me over the head and lets get to the sex. Once again director/writer John Waters presents a simple view about America's hatred of sex. Waters presents his hilariously warped view; and we the viewers are better for it. The acting is really good and of course the music. What is a Waters film without his hand picked music. Of special note: Ulman's Hokey Pokey dance number is classic Waters. It is good to see Ulman and Knoxville join the cast of Waters' usual suspects, including Patty!Enjoy the film, but word of warning: don't watch the neutered version."
1,edible rubber,"I have spent the last 48 hours wondering what I may have done wrong. The sausages stuffed pefectly but I realize after cooking that the casings were probably 3x thicker than normal collagen casings. As a result, they are like chewing on rubber. Moreover, because of the thickness, if you try to cut a sausage in half before cooking, the casing contracts so violently during co0king that it expels 2/3 of the contents. Maybe I just got a bad batch."
1,Mr Rankin may be completely barking mad,"I have previously read at least 4 books by Robert Rankins and enjoyed them. I found this one way to hard to follow any sort of plot. The book is full of very funny/clever sentences. But I feel he has lost the plot when it comes to writting a story and is trying to be to clever with the ""funny"" bits. I'm sad to say I did not finish the book."
3,"If only, if only...","I have a girlfriend but when I'm in the kitchen, Calphalon is my paramour.Which is why this masher saddens me. The other reviewers have it right, smooth design, sturdy construction, gets into tight spaces, and a strong tactile response. But those are things I look for in a hammer, not a potato masher.The mashing end is HIGHLY inefficient: holes are too small, plastic supersedes the space available for pressing food through. And so much is stuck in those holes and on the underside of the masher once you're through. A plain wire masher won't scratch your nonstick pans (assuming you're acquainted with finesse), isn't a tenth as wasteful, and is MUCH more efficient.Bottom Line:I strongly suggest getting something else to fulfill your mashing needs."
5,Great potato masher and saves pan finish,I was a little hesitant about trying this masher because it is thicker than the metal one I had been using. I usually slide the masher under the potatoes as I mash to move the bottom to the top for mashing. I have been getting away from the metal tools to protect my new stainless cookware. So I decided to try this masher. I'm glad I did!! It works great and my old metal masher is now in the box for Goodwill.
2,Not as sturdy as you think,"I purchased this masher with high expectations given the Calphalon name, the design, and the material. However, the first time I used it the top part came off and kept coming off while trying to mash the potatoes. Needless to say, I was very disappointed."
5,Buy 2 - you will wear this one out!,"I bought this went it first hit the streets...it is an addictive CD.The blend of the lead singer's voice (which is great...carries well) and the tight horn section can't be beat.H&C truly were one of the world's most underrated bands. I saw them open for Midnight Oil....this was the best show I've ever seen.If you can find a CD with the Living Daylights cut, do so.Great band, great CD."
5,A Great Read,"Really liked this book. I used to think I took stamp collecting seriously but after reading this book I'm throwing in the towel. A fascinating autobiography about one man's journey from hobbyist record collector to music history expert. Blecha was one of the early curators of billionaire Paul Allen's EMP (Experience Music Project) and this is the story of his life ---- from garage sale record scrounger to museum curator. A very funny read filled with lots of interesting stories about the art and mania of collecting, the thrill of the hunt, and his life as a curator responsible for spending a decent portion of Allen's fortune to build a world class music archive. If you have any interest in collecting - whether it be vintage coca cola bottles or hub caps - this is the read for you."
2,Not at all pleased..,"My friends and I have all cooked from this book numerous times, and every time we have been let down with the results.. we aren't novice cooks, and do have access to fresh, quality ingredients, so I don't know what it is... I wouldn't recommend this one.."
2,useless,"I tried this to help with some of my social skills and after 2 1/2 months of the maximum dosage, I noticed very little to no results. I quit taking it for a week, and still noticed no change in my mood. Something else that did help though was to get a good blender (I opted for the Nutribullet) and make myself a veggie/fruit smoothie once or twice a day. Apparently even though I had a relatively decent diet, I still needed some nutritional boosting. Different people are wired differently, but Amoryn just didn't do squat for me."
5,Nice,"Used it to decorate my granddaughters birthday cake, exactly enough to write and add flowers on top and all the way around the cake. It was very pretty."
4,Totally enjoyed this Kodo CD,"The CD is from 1995 and needs a bit of remastering for today's digital equipment. If it were not for that this CD probably would have gotten a higher rating. Nevertheless, the sound was fine and the energetic performance by Kodo is worthy of a listen. If you have never experienced Japanese taiko drums, sample this CD or better yet purchase the DVD. I wished I had purchased the DVD so I could see the performance as well. Those huge drums and the coordination between the drummers makes for incredible sound and an awesome show when done correctly. It must have been transcendeant for Kodo to be drumming in the incredible Acropolis. As with all great art & music the experience transports you. Maybe it was because I had not been doing my Reiki healing rounds at the hospital and had some energy building up in me, but when I listened to the CD I felt kundalini energy pulsing in my body...WOW."
2,Too much!!,I paid waaaaayyyy too much for the stupid shipping cost! Totally NOT work the cost. You could have easily sent the item in a envelope!!!
3,Not as I expected.,"I bought this CD because I heard that the band plays a cover of Paul Young's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" on it. I am a little confused. I imagine that the Arm would have rocked it up a little, as modern bands like to do, so I wasn't expecting the lush and orchestrated majestic pop of Mr. Young's original. The aforementioned song, however, was nowhere to be found. Not as a hidden bonus track, not as a misnamed song. Nowhere. All in all, I'll listen to this occasionally, but more often if only that joyous song were included."
3,Not really about a small bird or any other aspect of nature,"Not what I expected. I had been looking for a book of nature poems - one that celebrated the wonders of nature and pointed out its subtleties in poetic ways that make you think. This book doesn't do that. Most of the poems are written in the first person (e.g. I did this.....my mind does that, etc). There are words and analogies from nature mixed in but its definitely more about the author's predicaments or struggles rather than about the beauty of nature itself. An example is the one entitled Mother's day....""Praise to my mother, who is now the dirt I crumble in my hands as I dig to plant flowers on her grave....."" I think the overall theme of the poems has more to do with self reflection, reflecting on the death of her mother, reflecting on childhood, etc. There are a few poems that I liked but it just wasn't the nature focus I had expected."
4,"I like it, I like it, what can I do I like it","I bought this CD because I heard Spirit in the Sky and wanted to listen to it again. I'm not religious, in fact I'm an atheist but that doesn't seem to get in the way of my liking it. I imagine NG is a jew and not a devotee of JC. At any rate, to me music is music and I don't have to agree with what it is saying. Heck I enjoy Go Tell it on a Mountain despite having no Christian background. I'm like the dog you pet on the head and call him an SOB, I just eat up being petted (by music). I like Tom Lehrer's I Hold Your Hand in Mine, not just for the comic value, but I think it is good music, too. I guess I'm a little weird like NG although I am the opposite of a hippie, being a very conventional sort. I like most of the other pieces on the CD also, especially Canned Ham."
4,Lasts a Little Longer,"My daughter just started lessons this fall. Beginners go through a lot of reeds. The reeds seem to be almost as expensive as the cost of renting the instrument.These reeds do seem to give her a better sound, and they last for more practices than the ones without ""Plasticover"". I will not buy the other type anymore."
1,Do not buy this!,"Do not buy this product! This pumpkin head stake runs on batteries installed in the back of the head. However, the phillips screws holding the battery enclosure are extremely small and I could not get the battery enclosure open, even with the tiniest of phillips screwdrivers! I even tried a tiny pair of manicure scissors, to no avail. They do not make a phillips screwdriver small enough to get the battery enclosure open, so the stake is useless, unless you want to use it without the glowing eyes..."
1,Awesome idea that left me disappointed,"I thought this was a perfect gift for my earth conscious husband. I purchased this 4 months ago. When we received we mounted it the grill, which was a little challenging but we finally found a spot for it. We turned it on and were excited to see it light up. A week later we tried turning the light on after it had been outside charging and it would not turn on. We have tried it several times since and it still doesn't work. We have now procrastinated past the point of return so now it's just trash. :("
3,A Warm-up For L.A. Confidential,"I think I agree with most critics who say that Jerry Goldsmith's score for ""City Hall"" is like a warm-up for ""L.A. Confidential"", and the tracks 'The Bridge' and 'The Meet' are proof of that. Although I have to admit that those two cues are the best of the CD, as well as 'Old Friends' and 'Count On It. The music certainly has that New York feel to it since the movie takes place there. Unfortunately, as for the rest of the album, it all sounds like there is no way to go; and it remains too quiet for my taste, possibly because the film itself is kinda dull in spite of Al Pacino's usual overperformance that keeps anybody awake. But then again, there is ""L.A. Confidential""..."
1,Thought I was getting just primrose oil,This primrose oil comes combined with a truckload of other omega 6. Not good for your bodies natural anti-inflammatory response. I'll be looking for pure primrose oil in the future.
5,No Crazy Ingrediants Here,"I checked this book out from the library, and now I can't get along without it so I had to buy it! The recipes are easy, don't include strange ingrediants that I have never heard of or can't locate in the grocery store, and even use leftovers. There are also recipes for sauces and dips. My children are 5 and 7 and they love to dip everything so this was especially helpful for me. Simple tips are included such as ""add spices to your mayonaise, and a plain sandwich becomes special"". They then included fancy mayonaise recipes, and what type of sandwich meat and fixings are good paired with them. If you like to make recipes with what you have on hand, this book is for you!"
1,not so hot,this is one that i regret buyinga lot of repetitive recipes - how many chili recipes can one person really need ?i don't find that this one is worth any amount of money..a real dog
4,"Great, educational fun","These cards were every bit as much fun as I hoped they would be. The only thing that was less than great was the fact that the card box was slightly too big for the card deck, so I think it will not last nearly as long the cards."
5,Very pleased with Deep In The Hole,"Great CD, in new, perfect shape, promptly delivered, performs quite well. A very reasonable price for an excellent piece of desert rock.Who could ask for more?"
5,Gainsborough's Vision - An informative read,An extremely good book. I'm not seriously into Art but I saw this book at a friend's house and I was very impressed. - Very interesting and informative
3,It's Okay,I bought this after my mother told me to. It is known to help thicken hair or help with hair loss. I didn't notice a difference.
2,didnt work for me,this product came on time. I bought it because I saw it on dr oz who said it can help with hair regrowth. I used it for a while and it didnt help me at all. cant say I would recommand it to a friend because everybody is different .
4,My 2nd order of Black Currant Oil from Amazon,"This is my 2nd order of Black Currant Oil. Before taking - I had been struggling with sore gums, even though my Dentist could not find a problem. My gums are great now! Hoping to get stronger hair after this second order."
3,FYI ~ Gelatin Capsules,I wish I would have know that before I bought them! I didn't seen it mentioned anywhere and was dissapointed that they were...however if you don't mind gelatin these are the ones for you!
5,Ready to Meet,"I found this to be an easy-to-follow guide with up-to-date information. It contains information that covers a wide range of events, from formal to casual. I had to use this for a class, and after this class it will be a great reference tool--even out of the business arena!"
3,If you like this genre you'll enjoy this book.,"Air Force Wives is an interesting look at four girls and their subsequent marriages to men in the Air Force. While not entirely accurate, it is good as a caricature of some stereotyped military wives: the wife that wears her husbands rank, the drunken floozy, the gal that marries beneath her and the ""girl with something to prove."" Fun reading if not taken too seriously."
2,Fairly Disappointing,"Just received mine in the mail today. Based on the other reviews, I was expecting beautiful, practical arrangements for every occasion and season. The book is too impractical, though--most of the arrangements are too weird and 'artsy' and would not work for normal special occasions, like weddings and showers. There are a few pages with some beautiful, practical arrangements, but no instructions on how to re-create them. You would be better off flipping through a Martha Stewart magazine for ideas and how-to's."
4,go thorpy go (suck more piss!!),"if you were at sunbury or the myer music bowl back in the seventies then you will remember what a dominant force thorpy was.the insane volume and driving blues riffs and thorpy's unmatched vocal power(not forgetting the crowd chanting ""suck more piss""). a concert i saw them underground on the corner of spring & flinders street(i think it was) is one of the best live shows ever.the surprise is the first 3 tracks which are all new and are the best on the album.of course over the rainbow, ooh pooh pah doo & and bee bop a luh lah and that massive wall of sound are great memories!"
1,presentation and packageing worst I have ever seen,"I ordered these fruit slices as they were in the pics !!! When I received them they were all jumbled in a bag and were Very thin , some were bent over etc. !!!The pics were also misleading in colors and flavors asst . The actual flavors were mediocre at best !! I certainly would never order from this company again . What a waste of my money , and it was not cheap !!! [...]"
4,Metal Gear solid:snake eater,"I think this game is going to be fantastic i'm a big fan of the metal gears. I think the storylines are fantastic and i have heard this one is going to be extraordinary with a good twist. On this game you can climb trees use stealth more advanced than ever. Also you can shoot from the water and eat snakes and even put a crocodile head on your head to scare the guards. i have heard its set in 1960,s with 1960's weapons and flamethrowers. i can' wait for this to come out because it is going to be the best game ever."
4,best series of game ever,"This game looks unbelievable. The graphics are outstanding. And much like the first two, which are two of the best games i have ever played, this game has a great story and compared to the first two, expecially the first one, these graphics will leave you breathless. I cannot wait until November when i will definitely go buy this one. Along with the first two Metal Gear Solid is in my mind the best action game series ever."
4,great game...just too short and i really give this a 4.5 but that's not an option,great game. stealth and tactics play huge role and back to the outdoors. gameplay is phenomenal but i was expecting more. just too short. only negative about game
5,Very good product,I Have used this power supply for more than 1 year and is working very well and is very quiet.
2,Entertaining Revisionist History,"This is an interesting book if you are interested in revisionist history. The author exhibits the same blindness on the causes and motivation of the American colonists exhibited by his direct ancestor, Lord George Grenville (of Stamp Act fame) that cost Great Britian the war in the first place. The Americans were unreasonable minor players, the French actually won the war, and the U.S. Constitution ""imposed a measure of central control, taxation and military enforcement greater than any previously attempted by the British...""I highly recommend that you read this book with several grains of salt - and other sources of historical information - at hand. If you are truly interested in the causes of the American Revolution, there are many other excellent sources of information available. I highly recommend H.W. Brands' The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin as a place to start."
3,"Style, chops and thin voice",Robben Ford is a wonderfully fluid and stylish player. He is also very likable. This DVD showcases that admirably. It also showcases his one weakness which is his thin nasal vocals. This is one reason I pray every day that Larry Carlton never sings. Try as he will Ford just can't pull off the blues vocal believably which is not to cut short his melding of a blues/jazz riff based idiom.
4,Breaking 80?,"I have to agree with another reviewer that it would seem highly unlikely that a person could carry a plus-handicap and RARELY be able to break 80 (and sometimes 90) in the tournaments. That said, the book is full of insight into the PGA and the enormous effort it takes to qualify for ""the show"". Mr. Coyne is an excellent and oftentimes very funny writer who finishes his story on a high note.This book would make an excellent gift for the golf fanatic in the family!"
5,BEST WORK FROM GRAHAM EVER,"THIS CD OF GRAHAM RUSSELL IS LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR, I LOVE ALL THE SONGS ON THIS CD!!! ITS CLASSIC GRAHAM ALL THE WAY. ITS NICE TO HEAR JUST GRAHAMS VOICE (I LOVE RUSSELL'S TOO).IT REALLY SHOWCASES HIS VOICE AND SONGWRITING ABILITY, THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY AIR SUPPLY FAN!!!!!!!"
4,nice flow,"When I got this cd I was not too happy with cd2 of the set. The first is just mind blowing but the second I wasn't too sure about at first but it's all about keepin' it coming. CD2 has a nice flow, CD1 it's a riot; not much else to ask for."
2,Amazing Pursuit by a committed individual,"I am simply amazed how a committed individual can single handedly achieve for a social cause in a foreign land under adverse conditions,politically and geographically speaking. Hats off to Mortenson; let his brand of warriers to help education of children especially the girls, grow from strength to strength. Let us create a literate world and throw out terrorism.I raise a toast of hot cup of Indian Tea to Mr.Freg Mortenson. I sincerely wish he gets a Nobel Award in not so distant future.Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace... One School at a Time"
5,inspiring,We've given this book to four friends already both for the alternate view of Pakistan and for the inspirational work described in it.
3,Would have been a great article,"This is a tale about a remarkable man - unfortunately it is not very well written. Even tho the action takes place in different towns, it is basically the same story over and over. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in building schools for the poor in Pakistan and also as an aid to sleeplessness."
3,3 cups of Tea is interesting.,I shared this book with about 10 other women and we all really enjoyed the interesting writing although there were times it was a little drawn out. The knowledge shared was really great.
3,Book club,I bought this book to read at our reading club and found it very interesting. It arrived on time and in good condition.
4,Avoiding Knee-jerk Reaction to the World Around Us,"With regard to the book it is a great story and inspirational. With regard to Greg Mortenson -- the real world is not black & white, but shades of gray. How can we so harshly judge another person, when all us humans are by definition imperfect and fallible. For a more balanced view of Greg Mortenson and CAI, see this article, including the comments --[...]"
1,Three Cups of Tea,"This was a tedious read. I could not get into it at all.I would only recommend it to people who are interested in the minutiae of events.Not to detract from the honest goodness of this man and his family, but truly this read was hard work.L.Albert"
2,Interesting but poorly written and tedious,"I agree with all of the one and two star reviews. The writing is tedious and sophomoric. Mortenson, while undeniably doing some great things in Pakistan and Afganistan, is irresponsible, undisciplined, and self-absorbed. I couldn't figure out why he wasn't able to save some money for his cause while he was living out of his car and virtually had no expenses - I guess that was because he only worked part-time?! But think what you will about Mortenson, the writing should be enough to keep anyone from reading, let alone buying this book."
3,Read first quarter and last two chapters,"We read this book for our book club recently. While it started out strong - I was excited to learn how a mountain climber became a builder of schools in Pakistan - I quickly became lulled to sleep by the repetition of the scenarios. Greg goes into a small village, meets with the elders to discuss their needs, sources all the building materials, and builds a school against the odds. I know I sound jaded a bit, but the book became somewhat monotonous by the end. It could have been a much shorter book, I felt. It was interesting to learn more about this part of the world, but I tuned out by the end. I also became annoyed by Greg's apparent inability to delegate. His wife should be sainted!"
5,Speechless,Every American should read this now. Greg Mortenson should be given a Nobel Peace prize. What an inspiration in these times!
5,"Read It, PLEASE","I just finished this book and was in tears. It truly gives the unintiated a look into the ""real"" world of Pakistan and Aphganistan. Greg Mortenson is truly one orf the world's great people- his dedication to the education of children is totally awe-inspiring. It seems that America has forgotten the real casualties, who have had NOTHING to do with this war- the children. I do hope that enough politicians read this wonderful book and get some of the very much needed help to these brave and simple people. (P.S. This is the first time I've ever wrote a review and probably won't again. But in this case, I want to PLEAD with anyone with an ounce of humanity to read and do something, with regards to this great project.)"
5,Inspiring - must read!,"This book puts everything in perspective for me, how blessed we are here in the U.S. in so many ways, and how giving just a few dollars can go a long way to helping those less fortunate. Well written, the story was gripping and uplifting, inspiring me to see how education really is the key. I was so moved, I bought 4 more books and gave them to friends to read!"
5,Overdue and overlooked,"David Oliver Relin's marvelously well-told report of how a dedicated individual is making changes in the least accessible and most hardened society on earth is not just a wonderful read--it's truly inspirational. His pragmatic and compassionate approach is long overdue in what is supposed to be a civilized world the majority of whose population is comprised of adherents to religions and declared principles of truth and caring. Unfortunately, like so many others who have in various ways tried to accomplish good quietly and gently, his method is largely overlooked. It's hard to believe anyone who reads this book can leave it without seeing public policy in a new light."
4,Conquering ignorance - my own first,"I'm not sure I could ever articulate the pleasure that I had in donating after I was inspired by the capabilities of one; the strength from family and relationships; and finally, the true definition of an investment. I want to say that the intent and outcomes of one man and his believers have been remarkable. Let's hope that the intent transcends the man and the effects of time."
5,Amazing,"One of the best books I have ever read. Inspiring, amazing and perhaps the most motivational story I have heard."
5,Inspirational,"A great book that makes you think how each individual can change the world if they really try. A fast read if you are leading a busy life, and a book to pass around to friends and family and young achievers."
3,Three Cups Of Tea,"Very nice book but became a tough read during the last third. Writing was fractured but the story itself was most inspirational. Only problem I had was in that I did not read a lot of ""self help"". With the mid east oil revenues I feel they could do a lot more for themselves and by themselves.Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a Time"
5,AMAZING!,"Once I started reading this book, I did not put it down till I as completely done and forever changed. This books makes you heart hurt for the children of Pakistan. Greg Mortenson should forever be praised for the all lives he has changed. Every one should contribute something to his organization, even if it is a dollar. We need to fight for the children in the world. Read this book and you will never feel the same. You will have so much compassion for Greg Mortenson that you will want to jump up and help in any way you can. I think everyone should read this book who cares about the war, it will make you understand it more."
5,Most Inspiring Book - Educate instead of Invade,This inspiring book takes us in a very wonderful direction - education.You must purchase this book and read it - your life will be changed.I just made a $50/month pledge to the organization to support education of children in Pakistan and Afganistan. Dr. Greg is our hero - Thank you!
5,FABULOUS,"This is such an inspiring story. ""Dr. Greg"" is an amazing man. Read this book and be moved to take action yourself. He has made a difference in so many lives!"
4,Very engaging story,"This is a well-crafted story and a very easy read. It is an engaging journey of an American who most people would take as a bum, who, due to his unique background and creativity, finds himself able to move mountains to achieve his goals. The only downside to this book is that the last third was a little repetitious. But I would definitely recommend it."
5,An inspiring true story...,"This book is an amazing account of what one person can do to change the world. For me, it was interesting to learn about how one can promote peace through education, by changing the way people perceive things. Too often, innocent lives are lost because of ignorance and intolerance. Greg Mortenson is an example to all of us."
1,2011 CSAF reading list?! Really?!?!,"Considering that enough evidence has been released proving this book is written on lies, no matter how 'inspiring' the tall tales are, they are still fabricated. Why then should this book be acknowledged on the 2011 Chief of Staff reading list?"
5,"As an educator, I laughed, I cried, I was moved","My daughter was sent this book as required reading for freshman at St. John's University. In an effort to make the task more enjoyable, I decided to read it so that we could discuss it as she read. I was so impressed with the way it was written and the story itself, I was moved to action. I teach in a school with several Islamic students, many from Pakistan and Afghanistan, who have taught me so much. However, these students face prejudice everyday. I have asked for the book to be ordered for required reading in all world history classes. This is a must read for everyone, but especially for those who believe Islam is a culture of terror. This book offers an exceptional insight into life in rural Afghanistan and Pakistan. It shows the value of education and an understanding of the vast majority of Muslims."
5,Be Prepared To Expand Your List of Best Books,"This is one of the best books I have ever read-and I have read many. The book is inspiring, humbling and causes the reader to examine his/her own contribution to humanity without being preachy. The story has been explained in numerous reviews so I will not do it again. But have two observations that have not been mentioned much: (1) Greg, especially at the beginning of his efforts, makes a number of mistakes which demonstrate how very human he is, but this should encourage each of us to recognize regardless of our own shortcomings with commitment great things can be achieved; and (2) Greg's dedication is incredible but so too is that of his wife and of all who have chosen to reject cynicism and to give of themselves to move CAI forward. The pen is mightier than the sword."
5,WOW!,"This was one of the most inspiring stories I've ever read, AND it was very well written! I hated for the book to end. Will there be a sequal?"
5,Wow!,"If you feel helpless to influence world events, here's a way to do your part in something positive for a change rather than wish, hope, and mumble about the way things are. These people are onto something great! A good read and a glimpse into a world we don't often get to see."
5,Stop wasting time readng reviews and just buy the book! It will change your life.,"The book itself is one of those books that inspires hope for anyone. It is a reminder how anyone (more to the point - one person), of modest means, can make a difference in this world. How the the powerful effect of doing the right thing can come full circle and manifest greatness in one's life.I am hoping that it will soon be translated into many languages as it will be a book I will continue to gift and share with others in the future.I only have one gripe about the book and that gripe is for Amazon, not the book itself. Why is the Kindle download price higher than the actual book price? Come on Amazon, if the additional profits from the additional eBooks pricing were going to Greg Mortenson's CAI to help promote reading and education (Satellite downloads into Schools), then I would be forgiving about this discrepancy."
5,Inspiring subject matter plus very readable,"Inspiring books like this can be tedious, but I found this one fascinating and enjoyable to read. A wonderful book about how positive changes can be made in a very difficult part of the world."
2,Poor writing and a story drawn out for too long!,"I am in a bookclub, so when it was my turn choose a book, I asked some friends for recommendataions, and they told me that Three Cups of Tea was next on their list of books to read. None of them had actually read it, but they all indicated that wanted to read it. When I looked it up on Amazon, it sparked my interest. I have lived in the Middle East, I have climbed Kimimanjaro, and I am a teacher--it seemed to me that there would be no book that could better suit my interests and experiences. However, I was very disappointed. This book is poorly written and a story that could be inspiring is told with a painful about of detail. Although I am hosting the book club discussion this month, I couldn't finish the book. What more can I say? I do not recommend this book. Needless to say, I will tell my friends to save their time and money and read something else."
5,Education=Peace,"You must read this book.........Everyone must read this book. If for no other reason to see a piece of the world most of us will NEVER even glimpse! What an intimate story of one man and his triumphs and tribulations!! Get this book and share it, donate it to a library or a school. Go to his website www.ikat.org and bring friends to his lectures. The more people know of this goodness the better off the whole world is!!"
5,An accurate feeling for working in Afghanistan,"I was already in country in Afghanistan with the US military in fall 2006 when I read Three Cups of Tea. I found it accurately represents my experience with Afghans as I mentored those in the military, and found it a helpful reference when I gained additional duties in the civil affairs realm. When asked what needs to happen to improve things in Afghanistan, Three Cups of Tea is the first book I tell folks to read to understand the situation in that region."
5,How A normal guy has changed the course of not just his life but countries,"I started reading this book expecting to see some action as it mentioned about how a mountain climber would build schools in a hostile environment. But as I kept reading, I found an amazingly compassionate person who was one among us but a determination to do what he felt was right. No matter when or where. A must read for every person who has similar interests or would want to help people who are less privileged. I loved it."
2,"great book, must read","This was an outstanding book, it makes you realize what one dedicated person can do to help change the world. Well written, I couldn't put it down, it was a one day read."
1,Rip off,I'd love to read this book. But I won't. The cost of buying it on Kindle is almost twice the asking price of the trade paperback version. I am not willing to be cheated.
3,School Assignment,This was a book my child was required to read for school. According to her she wasn't a fan but she read it and did very well on her assignments.
4,"When there is a Will, there is a Way.","What Greg Mortenson has done shows how human will to make a difference and be of some help can break all the barriers. He faced both cultural and financial barriers and over came. A Persian poet says: Put step in the way, And the way will tell you how to go ahead. And Mortenson is a proof of how ""the way"" takes you ahead when you have a certain will but no clue how to proceed. It also shows how humanity stands far above all differences, be it cultural, lingual, religious ...The story telling is obviously not the best I have ever read. Thats why I rate it 4. Otherwise, Greg Mortenson deserves 5+. He is already in my list of living heroes!"
3,"Starts off with a bang, but...","At first I couldn't put this book down, but as I neared the end it became overwhelmingly monotonous and frustrating to finish. The style of writing should have gone through a couple more proof reads and I frankly got sick of the political jabs. Even if I agree with his politics, the comments towards the Bush Administration are childish and whiny. Don't waste the readers time with comments about not being offered a chair in Rumsfeld's office to sit in. For someone who goes out of his way to tell the reader about all that he has had to do without in order to save money for the schools, boo-hoo comments like this made me lose respect for him, but not his mission. I have told many to read Three Cups of Tea to learn more about what he has been able to accomplish, but as another reviewer stated, the mission deserves 5 stars, the book 3. I am glad I checked this one out from the library."
1,only motivational fairy tales!!!,"I absolutely have no faith in a change in the mentality of this people. South Korea and Gemany are two country that from dirt poor became great nations today because of the effort of their people, not in Afghanistan do not dream of it. And I am here right now everyday and it is also my thrid time here."
1,Very Bad,I fell asleep reading this book after the table of contents...Worst book ever to be published...Waste of paper...Stay away from this book if possible...We have to read it for school and I am just going to take an F on it because it is just that bad.
1,330 pages of 336 to long,"I took comments from others because they nailed this book perfectly.Remarkable person and deeds,horrible writing.T for Tedious.Agonizingly poor writing style.ego-centric, Terrible Read.very good story, but awful writing.Worst writing I've read in a long time.Too bad that they couldn't get a better writer to tell a great story. What a SHAME!!!""Disappointed"" doesn't begin to describe my reaction.Each sentence is so overly polished that you can hardly see the story through the glare. Irritating to read.This could be told is a few pages, or a few words... He built a school for poor kids in another country."
5,real american hero,"As a professional human being, I demand that this book be read or purchased and read. It is very inspiring and educational in what it is we are all blind to see. The quality of the materials is also top notch. Meant to be read over and over; shared by all. This book is a definite must-have!"
2,could not finish this book,"I was looking for some new material and seeing over 2000 positive reviews I bought this book. There is only 3 other books in my life that I would not finish , and this one is one of them. There is basically no dialogue and all after 2 pages of scenery details I was bored to death. Currently the book is collecting dust in my library!"
1,Disappointment,After watching the 60 Minutes program last night I was terribly disappointed with the author and his foundation. I think he should be investigated heavily for misdeeds with other people's money. The book is fake and so is he.
1,One Million Cups of Bull,"So according to 60 Minutes, not only did Mortenson lie about his exploits in this book but there are also big questions about whether his charity is legit. My problem with Mortenson was always that he seemed too good to be true. I wanted to believe in him but just couldn't buy into his simplistic solutions to problems that have plagued humanity for centuries. If 60 Minutes is correct, it looks like Mortenson is indeed ""too good to be true"" and the reality is that he is just another smooth talking con-man who told stories to get people to open up their wallets. So sad."
5,Inspiring!,"Three Cups of Tea is an amazing and inspirational book that everyone should read! Greg Mortenson is an ex-mountaineering man who by chance begins to build schools throughout the most dangerous and impoverished regions in Pakistan.This book narrates Greg's journey and the process in which he has now built around 60 schools that provide free and un-biased education to small villages in Pakistan and Afghanistan.Anyone interested in Mortenson's plight to end terrorism by increasing literacy will learn a lot from reading this book.Although hard to read for the first chapter or so I highly recommend it for the positive, inspiring and easy to realtable message that it delivers!!!"
3,"Terrific, hopeful, true story","My seatmate on a return flight after Christmas told me about this book, then I saw the author interviewed on Book TV. A hopeful, amazing story about how a kind of goffy and very sweet guy is helping to save the world. Forget military intervention. Education and opening doors for Muslim communities takes longer and it also lasts longer. If we can have the patience."
1,Three Cups of Swill,"How typical; this fool comes up with a bunch of lies about how we can all just luvvv each other and the whole world will stand on a mountain and sing songs about peace like an old Coke commercial. I picked this up some years ago and read a part of it, but the author was so clearly full of himself that I'm not surprised to find it's lies. I'm only submitting a review now because the average score needs to be lowered on this collection of lies."
3,B activity P.H.,"I read the book three cups of tea about one week ago and in my opinion the writing of the book was not the best, but the message was said very well. The story is about how Greg Mortenson started building schools for girls and boys in Pakistan. It broke down sterotypes that some may have for those that live in that part of the world, and sterotypes about those who are Muslim. If you would like to learn about the culture along with one man's struggle in helping children all over Pakistan then I would recommend this book to you."
3,Questionable content,"Read ""Three cups of deceit"" instead (by John Krakaur) and learn that the events that are told in this book, may never have taken place. This book is largely self-serving for the author."
5,More moving and more inspirational than any other book I've read,"I was given this book for Christmas by a dear friend. I just started it this afternoon and couldn't put it down. It's now midnight and I feel like jumping for joy with the excitement I'm feeling. This book is fabulous. It's so inspiring and so motivating. It's very well written and the author does an excellent job of grabbing the reader. The detail, the emotion, the excitement, the drudgery, the frustration are perfectly painted. I LOVE this book."
4,Thought-provoking.,"Despite the controversy surrounding the veracity of this book, it still makes for thought-provoking reading in this time when very few people seem to genuinely care enough about others to dedicate their lives to making a difference. I recommend it to anyone, but most particularly to those involed with outreach, education or relief work."
5,Everyone should read,Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend it to anyone who cares about the Middle East and wants first hand information.
4,This book is my cup of tea,"This is a very well-written book that interweaves numerous perspectives artfully and gracefully without losing sight of the story. I loved that the author inserted his life, love, family, everything that he was into the context of his life's work and it all came together so perfectly. He started with an amazing story, one that deserved to be shared. It was heartbreaking at times, which made the story that much more powerful. It is inspiring and courageous, and the majority of people would not undertake anything remotely this risky, which makes the author rare and unique. I would highly recommend it to anyone, I don't know how anyone could ever NOT like this book. It was a bit political at times, but that is an important and necessary aspect of the story so it still fit and was appropriate. Read this book now."
5,If Bush only had a fraction of the insight this man has...,"Long, wonderful book. Simple life-changing message. Stop ""fighting"" things we don't want and work ""for"" the things we do. This man, in a few years has quietly set in motion more hope for our planet, than all the egos in Washington have been able to do in double that time. Sometimes just ""listening to the wind"" as Mortenson describes in the book is far more productive than anything else. It would be irresponsible of me to not share this guy and his work with my children."
1,"Amazing story, but amazingly poorly written","This is an inspiring story, and the region and its people need to be understood by Americans. However, the writing was so horrific that it was hard to tease out the inspiration and meaning though the torturous prose. Somewhere near the middle of the book, it appears that the editor gave up with toning down the author, and my boredom and frustration increased with every page. It seemed that every page contained grammatically incorrect sentences. I think that if Mortenson himself would have told the story then we would have really grasped his humility without being told over and over how humble Greg was. It is too bad that the poor writing of this story prevented the reader from really getting to know the people central to the region."
5,An amazing story,"Three Cups of Tea is an amazing and inspiring story. It should be required reading for everyone who has hope for a peaceful world in the future. Thank you, Greg Mortenson, for your great work and for showing people in Pakistan and Afghanistan that there are some good Americans out there."
5,homelibrary,Three Cups of Tea was inspiring and educational. It provided an excellent description of Pakistan and the many challanges associated with living with the Taliban. I was amazed with the dedication of Greg and cooperation of the improvished villages in he built schools. Excellent book and I loved it. I purchased a book for my library. It is a book the reader wants to savor each chapter and not race through it.
5,Awe-inspiring,"First off this book was very well written. It was a captivating read and the author wrote the story in such a way as to convince the reader to never put the book down. I was inspired by Greg Mortenson. His work is simply amazing. He has really transformed the lives of every child he has ever meet. I felt that I learned so much more about the middle east, specifically Pakistan and Afghanistan than the media reports and the government every taught me. I hope that his dream comes true and that the war on terrorism is won through education. Everyone should definitely read this book."
4,Worth the Read,"I'll admit, I struggled through the first 100 pages but this should not hold you back! Greg Mortenson's work deserves to be known by everyone!"
4,Touching and hopeful,There is very few books that can move you like Three Cups of Tea. This book also educates us...
4,WOW!,"A Great Read that spans the generations...Mom, Grandma, Grandpa, Aunts, Uncles, Cousins and Children can all share in this truly inspiring book."
1,You can fool some people ...,"Uh-oh ... now we're learning that Greg Mortenson and James Frey were born conjoined twins, and were separated shortly after birth."
5,Joyce,"As others have noted, the detailed descriptions in this book are often unnecessarily ""flowery""... especially given the power of the extraordinary story of Greg Mortenson's work in Pakistan and Afhganistan. However, once I relaxed into the rhythm of the writing style, I actually enjoyed many of the author's ""distractions"". Mortenson's accomplishments are amazing and inspiring. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the countries and cultures of the Middle East. Very enlightening!"
3,Three Cups of Tea (Kindle version),"You can read other reviews about this fantastic story about one man's dedication. It's inspiring & amazing what he has done. Do not download the Kindle version if you care about maps and pictures. The Kindle version does not have these. It would have been helpful to see the people and part of the world he was helping. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed his story and the on-going cause. This a good way to help those areas."
5,Inspiring and discouraging all at the same time,"Much has already been written about this outstanding book by other readers here, so I'll keep it short. After reading Three Cups of Tea I felt both inspired and discouraged. Inspired because of the enormous odds the author has overcome to achieve what he has in Pakistan. Discouraged by the sheer enormity of the problem of Pakistan's terrible education system and the immensely powerful counter-tide posed by well-funded fundamentalist madrasahs springing up all over the place. It's good to know someone cares enough to try to make a real difference in people's lives. I hope enough other people are out there to ensure it becomes more than just a trickle in the face of the torrent of fundamentalism."
2,I wanted to like it,"I wanted to like this book. Based on the descriptions I read of the book, it seemed to be a perfect match with my beliefs. And then I tried to read it. And then I tried again. I couldn't get into it because it was written more like hero worship or propoganda than a story. I wish Dr. Greg continued success in his work, but I don't recommend the book."
3,Three Cups of Tea,"I know this is a very popular book, but in all honesty, this book bored me out of my mind. Maybe its because I had already read the allegations online that Greg Mortensen made everything up? All I kept thinking was, if he really did make the story up, then why didn't he come up with a better one? I thought the story dragged on forever. I just wanted to skip to the part where he actually builds the schools. I am not a horrible person, I promise. I am all for educating children in the Middle East, and I think its great that Mortensen has built all these schools out there- I am just not interested in his personal life story."
5,no words to describe,read it no matter who you are.. it will make a difference and give you a different perspective in life :)
3,green berets book,"It's OK if you are interested in how the Special Forces are equipped. No stories, it just informs about its training and camps with some descriptions."
1,Poor Condition,"Product was listed as ""good"" condition. When it arrived its pages were stained with what looked like coffee and had a warped cover. I don't consider this as good condition. This was a poor cared for item and a bad purchase. Yes, it was a bargain, but the discription was deceiving. I couldn't return it as the price for return was more than the book price!! Very disappointed!!"
5,Could not put the book down,"In the middle of packing for a move, I was given this book. I could not put it down: such focus, courage, fearlessness,adaptability, persuasive ability and, above all, skillful thought, speech and action in incredibly difficult circumstances. Such virtue truly tugged at the heartstrings. I often was on the verge of tears. Read this incredible story and tell others about it. Jonathan"
5,Gripping and Inspirational,"Education is the key to fighting global terrorism - Greg Mortenson illustrates this so clearly, so honestly and so thoughtfully. This is a must read for anyone who cares about those who really do make a difference."
4,Good Book,"I was required to read this book for one of my classes. The book definitely is quite captivating and I loved reading it. I would recommend this book to others because for me, I learned quite a bit about the Afghan area and the surrounding geography and governmental policies. I came into with no previous knowledge and out of it with a first person's view of what actually happens."
4,just read it!,"This story is so important that I urge everyone I know to read this book. However, I also hand it to them with the caveat, ""Just read it, even though the writing is clunky and amateurish at times."" Once I got through it, gritting my teeth through some of the less elegant passages, I felt so happy to know Greg Mortensen and the amazing mission he is on. It is an unforgetable story. It is eye-opening and humbling and a much needed antidote to the narrow media portrayal of the people, politics and culture that Greg is spending his life to uplift. I only wish the writing served the sensitivity and urgency of the subject better. However...So, I'll say it again, Please, just read the book, for the story, if not for the telling."
3,Great with a problem,It feels great. It's very comfortable on my back BUT it has a very strong smell wile mold or mildew. I inspected it and it 'looks' fine but it smells up the apartment. I set it outside for a few days to air out. I have allergies and can't use it stinking the way it does. Hopefully a few days in the Sun will correct the problem.
3,Get what you pay for,"GREAT product for such a low price. It feels great, and the hard board definitely helps keep its shape. I have it on my desk/computer chair and it makes my back feel much better.HOWEVER, my one discontent about this product is that the removable nylon cover does not stay in place. It stretches and slides down when I lean back in my chair or adjust myself. I'm worried that this will cause unnecessary wear and tear on the cover over time since it is stretching and shifting in odd places. It's also a pain to try to maneuver the cover back into the correct position."
5,Duro-Med back support review,"I wanted to get a back support pillow, as I have lower back pain due to osteoporosis in my spine. My chiropractor sells a similar pillow, but it is $40.00. This pillow appeared to be very similar, so I thought I would try it. I have it on my wheeled office chair, that I use when I am working on the computer. It feels nice to have this support for my lower back. The chair is much more comfortable with this backrest than without it. The price was great, even when you add the shipping, much less than other pillows I saw on the internet."
2,Only for very wide/deep chairs,"I am pregnant and having sciatic and lower back pain. The physiotherapist recommended buying a back-rest. I purchased this and could not wait to use to help my pain. Unfortunately this didn't work with my office chair. It literally took off inches from the depth and I felt like I had to strain even more to prevent myself from falling off the chair. I think it works only for deep chairs, however my office chair is normal so not sure which chairs this product is for. I am sending it back."
4,Lower Back Pain Suffer Here..,"When I started my new job in July of 2012, I started having a 20 to 30 minute commute. For the first month, I would get home at the end of the day, after sitting in an office chair and all that driving, and would be in pain. After several months of use, I highly recommend this product to those that want some extra support.Pros:Cardboard back provides a more secure surface for the foam to push againstCurved edge keeps my back in placeHas held up with daily use over 3 monthsCons:That straight cardboard back doesn't fit well into curved car seats (as other reviewers have said). This does mean you are pushed forward more then some might like.The strap on the back does not feel very high quality, and certainly could stretch a bit farther (Driver Seats are big!)Recommendations:To those that have to travel or are sitting at their desk, I would recommend this product. However be aware that the straight back might cause you to move forward in your car/desk chair."
5,Just what I was looking for :),I was having the most difficult time finding a back support at my local stores and so after a couple weeks of b@#%#ing about it my mom hopped on amazon and found it and just bought it! totally worth it! Very reasonably priced and works great!
1,Huge and bulky,"I didn't like this at all. Returned it. Don't recommend. When I put it on my car seat, it was very uncomfortable."
4,great back support,I bought two back support pillows and this one is by far the better of the two. I use it watching t.v and when I'm on the computer...doesn't lose it's shape and is very comfortable
2,kind of cheesy,The foam is kind of cheesy in this pillow so it has a piece of masonite in it for support. The cover is nice. It doesn't fit well in some chairs. The elastic strap is nice to hold it in place in the appropriate chair.
5,it helped,I was dealing with some severe back pain and then i bought this cushion and it has helped take away the pain and keep my posture straight.
3,Duro-Med Relax-a-Bac with Insert and Strap,"Bought this product on the reviews of others. Many liked it. It is what it claims it is. Unfortunately for me, my back is way to senititive right now so it is a little to firm for me even with the insert removed. Perhaps it will suit me better sometime down the road. This does give lower lumbar support but I was just diagnosed with a herniated disk and this is too much support at this time."
4,Great support,"I do a lot of gaming and video/photo editing so I spend most of my hours on a chair. I've been using this back support for a little over a week now and so far it works really well, though I haven't used any others to compare. If you're in the market for a back support, definitely give this one a try. It's very cheap so you really have nothing to lose.My only complaint is that the strap isn't big enough for my chair. I have an executive type chair which is a little wider up top than others. The straps of the back support is beyond stretched out. Because of this, the support would slowly rise up. Every so often I would have to slide it back down in place."
2,Too Bulky!,"Way too bulky, pushes my lower back out so much that my upper back doesn't touch the chair at all. Then it feels like I'm slouching."
3,not for a medium build woman,"the product had the right firmness and the side panels offer support, the curve feels good. Problem? I am 5-5 130# female and the size is too large to give me support."
1,worse back cushion,"This is the worst back cushion I have ever used. A piece of board is inside it and after using it I had back pain. I thought it was the regular foam back cushion, of which I have two already. Nasty product...."
3,Duro-Med Relax-a-Bac could be better,The Duro-Med Relax-a-Bac could be a little wider and strap to hold it up stronger. It does help keep me straight in my chair but everytime I get up it slides down to bottom and then I have to re-position it everytime I sit down. For the price its OK just wish it was a little be wider and it didn't slip down the chair.
1,Warning,This lumbar cushion has such a strong odor that we were unable to use it in our cars or in our house.
3,Does the job,"I purchased this lumbar support pillow for use at the office. It does what I needed it to do, i.e., provide enough support so that I can improve my posture when I an seated. Cons: width of pillow and non-adjustible strap make use with larger office chairs a bit difficult."
3,Don't use indoors,"I got the adult version of this to try and make sure I was getting my 2 qts of water. The spout is just a rubber plug so it leaks and gets stuck in the open position. It makes a huge mess. I could see it being fun for kids outside instead of drinking out of the hose, but be aware that it will leak out all over the place."
3,"Good item, wrong size","I ordered this product for my 1999 cbr 600 f4, and it was the wrong size. Its say on the page that it fits my bike but it was really a screen for like a 06 cbr 600. From what i saw of it, its a very nice screen, just not for my bike. 3 stars because of wrong advertising and returning but a good screen from puig."
3,Es bueno,"Es bueno pero prefiero el cold, el proveedor se porto muy bien con la calidad del producto, recomendado al 100%"
4,She liked it,"Very affordable and she liked it. Said it smell fresh, not overly overpowering and a fine complement after a refreshing shower. I guess that will make it 4 Stars."
5,Sister loves it!,"I bought ""Hot""'s counterpart ""Cold"" for myself and loved it so much and thought I'd try Hot as well since it is supposedly also unisex. After a sniff I definately discovered while Cold might be unisex, Hot is very feminine. Luckily I thought it smelled trendy enough that my sister would like it and she did! I must admit it smells good, very rich and floral. I love that it is so cheap and smells so expensive. I always recommend testing a perfume before buying it (they smell differently on all skin types) but at this price I couldn't resist and I won't critique you if you don't either. Trust me, both Hot and Cold smell fantastic.. Hot is perhaps even better, but only for women.. Cold is great for either."
2,The Thorn Birds 2 - The Missing Years,"The Thorn Birds 2- The Missing Years is disappointing. I thought the story was unconvincing, in particular the story of Luke. With the exception of Father Ralph's character (and the new Meggie's character) the acting is dull and uninteresting. Fee's character is most disappointing! Her intrepretation of the character leaves much to be desired. Whoever wishes to learn about the ""missing years"" should simply refer to the novel,The Thorn Birds, by Colleen McCullough.You will not be harmed by viewing this DVD, of course - and might be delighted, as I was, to see the gifted and handsome Richard Chamberlain on the screen once more, but I would recommend sticking to the original series, your own imagination, and the novel. Thanks."
4,delightful in it's own way,"The Missing Years is unforunately considered an unwanted ba$tard child among most Thornbird fans. That's really too bad IMHO. I happen to be one of Thornbird fans who found likes the Missing Years a great deal. It's not up to par with the original (few sequels ever are), but I honestly believe that it deserves more credit than it gets. I've enjoyed The Missing Years numerous times on VHS and I'm very happy it is on DVD."
2,The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years,"I was disappointed in this movie. When I ordered it, I was under the impression that it was part of the original made-for-TV movie series. Sadly, it was not, and I did not enjoy it much."
5,Great gift!,"Bought this as a gift, and my friend is crazy about it! He uses it inside and outside. Might get one for myself."
4,Now I can make better pancakes,"Getting that pancake grill to the right temperature was always a problem, and the grandchildren were not happy. Picked this one because it was the one that Alton Brown used on Food TV, and buying it at Amazon for about half the list price seemed like a good idea. I have checked the oven temperature, the freezer, and the griddle .. all look to be spot on what they should be. Is this a lab grade instrument? Does it cost what a lab grade costs? No, it is affordable and serves its purpose well. I am a happy cooker!"
4,Neat,I mess around with this thing in the kitchen quite a bit. It seems to do its job well. Would recommend to kitchen nerds and experienced chefs alike.
4,The Big Man!,"From 1985, this album by Clemons (and his Red Bank Rockers) is funky good fun that is also decidedly un-generic in some of its subject matter. Best known for the hit duet with Jackson Browne ""You're A Friend Of Mine"", but also check out ""Kissin' On U."""
3,MS and Jave....?,"There are too many people who work just on MS platforms (VB, VC++) or just in the Jave so why for heaven sake one should buy a book talk about the two of them..."
3,An enjoyable trilogy but overrated,"I enjoyed the Rhapsody trilogy, at least enough to finish the trilogy. I found all of the books to be longer than they needed to be, and quite overrated. To compare the books to the work of Tolkien is just insulting. That said I would agree that the trilogy is better than many out today in Fantasy and Science Fiction. However, I am so tired of the perfect, beautiful heroine who fights like a skilled warrior and has the compassion of a thousand saints. I guess that's my first problem with the books. Rhapsody's traveling companions are quite uninteresting to me as well; just characters I've seen before. That said, out of the three books Destiny was the most enjoyable to me. The story line and plot were more interesting and there were some surprises I enjoyed."
3,Great Match for My Other Winterberry,"These match my Winterberry pattern perfectly, but the red paint on the glasses (which all have to be handwashed) is flaking off at an alarming rate, even with gentle handwashing and mild detergent. That is the reason for the 3 stars. Pfaltzgraff (or whoever makes these matching glasses) needs to find a more durable paint."
1,Paint Comes Off,"Instructions say, ""Do not soak glasses in water or use warm water."" How are you supposed to get the glasses clean then? I put them in water for 10 seconds, rinsed, only to find the RED PAINT at the bottom of the glasses CAME OFF! This was BEFFORE using them! I was washing them for the first time when the paint came off. We haven't even drank from them yet. Very disappointing."
5,Ladder of Lights - Fire of Awareness,"This is a very subtle DVD yet it is priceless for people which seek balance, clarity, to enhance awareness and bring peace to their life.Unlike physical exercises these benefits are accumulative and build up over time - even after two years I feel that it opens gradually new levels. For anyone going through a time of transformation, test or is stuck in an emotional past this will support you noon else could.More than words I recommend to experience these exercise for those who a curious (even though I would first recommend one of the other DVD's of Ravi&Ana;). Really give it a go for 3 weeks (best every day) or better a months & see for yourself! This experience will speak for itself.For those on a spiritual path of any kind this is a priceless tool to connect outer and inner nature and definitely support you path."
2,Dual Fan Failure at about 3000 hours,"This has a 100 mm air input fan on the bottom and a 80 mm output on the side. However neither are ball bearing and both have failed within 2 weeks of each other after about 1 year of use - about 3000 hours, not even close to the advertised 50,000 MTBF. On the positive side, both failures led to overheating and the power supply did auto-shutdown without additional damage."
3,GREAT GAME BUT SOME BIG ERRORS,"This game is great. its resident evil, but in a way sort of like mini games. you play scenarios for example., excape from a bar alive, or get throught a hotel alive. But of course having the zombies and famous enemies.The only thing i hate about capcom when they made this game, is that they made it for ps2. The loading time when you go through a door is about 10-15 seconds per door. The graphics are not that great, and of course with ps2's online, it has many problems. Raandom disconects,lag ect. Thats why im made becuase they should have made it for xbox and xbox live to make the graphics better and make the load times ALOT better. The online would be better also. But its a fun game and would recomend it to anyone."
2,Not much footage for your money.,"Overall it was an OK watch but I buy videos for entertainment or education and this was lacking on either. There is a few minutes of helmet cam which is entertaining but it's boring terrain. The ""extra footage"" section of dust to glory has more riding than this whole movie. Matt LaBlanc is such a dork."
3,Contains essentials,Contains all the essential information and a little bit more but not much more. Over all a pretty good starter book.
2,Not very useful,"This book was written in a style that assumes prior knowledge of the material. In other words, much of what is written will make no sense whatsoever unless you already know the material, which makes much of the book useless. For example, the author states in the section covering Data Binding (Current Data Row): ""The Position property is fine when it comes to navigating the rows currently shown, but it's not good for finding the current row in the data table"". What does ""currently shown"" mean? What does ""current row"" mean in the context of DataSets, which have no concept of a current row? Is he referring to a Data Table object somewhere? In short, this sentence is useless. The rest of the treatment on this subject is the same. Useless. If one were to actually READ this book, they would find that there are many such examples throughout. That is unless, of course, one already knows the material, in which case the book is a waste of money."
3,Old one was better,"I bought this Microlight to replace one that I bought 5 years ago. The old one would be on while you were squeezing it, or it had a slider you could push forward that would lock it in the ON position. The new one gives you more options, but is more complicated. It is delivered in squeeze-light mode, but there is no slider. If you want it to stay on, you have to squeeze and hold for 15 seconds, and this puts the light in its normal mode. In this mode, if you squeeze it once, it turns on and stays on at max brightness. If you squeeze it twice, it stays on at half-brightness. If you squeeze it 3 times, it strobes. Having all the options is nice, especially the half-brightness. But I like being able to switch quickly between squeeze-mode and locked-on mode. This is not possible with the new system. PROs: Small, bright, durable, good clip, multiple modes. CONs: Difficult to switch between squeeze mode and locked-on mode."
1,Not so Great content,"THE GREAT COMPOSERS is not so much about the composers as it is about pretentious filmmaking and mediocre choreography. Any historical information about the composers lives was barely touched upon. The sampling of music was very limited and any discussion of the actual music, music theory or the musical inspiration seemed pretty much non-existant.The DVD could have been better described as an attempt by the production team to present a view of the many composers through interpretive dance and mood setting cinematography. I am sure that someone out there will enjoy this attempt but it is definately not my cup of tea . I expected something completely different...guess I've been spoiled by Ken Burns.It was difficult to know what this series was about because of lack of accurate descriptions or reviews. I pretty much ordered the product with my fingers crossed. Hope this review helps you."
2,"Poorly written, confusing book","I feel sorry for anyone purchasing this book. It's instructional value is close to nil- the only well done sections in the book are the problem sets. The ""teaching"" material is hopelessly confusing. If you have to have this book- make sure you have a very good teacher. Learning the material from the book WILL NOT HAPPEN."
2,Hard to relax to her robotic voice....,"I found myself distracted by the robotic tone of her voice... I think the Cd would have been more beneficial with a more soothing, relaxed voice. Also, I liked the affirmations more than the visualization section. I'll probably try to listen to it again..I believe in the mechanics of it..."
5,An All-Out Romp For Any Woman Who Was Once a Cootie-Girl,"This book was one of the best I've read. The main character, Robin Hudson, is suddenly thrust from her normal routine when an intern turns up missing. Following the trail to find her intern, Robin is forced to recall her past, and one of her oldest girlfriends, who shared her life as a ""cootie girl."" During her quest she comes across women in green wigs, policeman, strippers, and even gangsters!However, as she remarks, ""hindsight isn't 20/20,"" and she is forced to re-examine her life as a cootie girl, and how her alienation as a child has made her into the strong woman she is today.Sparkle Hayter creates fabulously funny and alive characters. She has also created a book that I couldn't put down. I would recommend it to everyone, especially if you want to have a good laugh, and a good thrill all in one book."
3,Entertaining...but...,No where near as good as her first two books. Still an entertaining way to spend an afternoon though.
5,every song is great,"This disc is really fun. Smokescreen is a great sing a long and Pony is so good. The guitar lick on Chocolate Covered Secrets is cool. My kids like it, my friends like it and it is in my CD player all the time. It hasn't been out of my changer since I got it. Plus they are great live. Fresh."
1,Terrible,"There was nothing to follow...nothing to read. I couldn't understand it even after reading it half way through. I hate to say, I put it down. There was no point to the novel."
1,Worse Clam Chowder ever,"I am from the East Coast and have had many delicious chowders. This is not one of them. The tomato base had a strange taste. The clams were chewy. But, the worse was that the soup was so salty in taste (1600mg per can) that I only ate two spoonfuls before I threw it out. I also bought the seafood bisque, but I doubt I'll even try it. I can't imagine that this is the same soup they serve in their restaurants. Something bad must happen from cooking to canning."
1,Amazing,"Having heard a great deal about this series, I thought I would give it a try. Very disappointing. The writing seems geared toward early readers who are very easily entertained and not very well read. Extremely wordy, and I was surprised at the lack of quality in the writing. Anyone past the 3rd grade should be reading better written books."
5,H.P. Rocks!!!!!!!!!,"Harry Potter rocks! If you didn't read these books yet, it's about time! If you don't like science fiction, don't worry, this is a different type of it. I don't like science fiction, but these books are just wow. For people who already read the books, I have a few things to say: Rumor-5th book will be ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix"". I recomend ""A Wrinkle In Time"" (If you're Polish, also read ""Corka Czarownic""). A lot of people tell me I'm obsesed with H.P. ( I know all the actors names & faves, I know all the spells, and etc.), but it's impossible not to. Isn't this a cute wizard? (sideways) *<l :)"
5,excellent,"Harry Potter...hmm...what can I say, it brings out the imagination of a child. The book was wonderful. I enjoyed it very much with all the action going on at one time. It seemed to me as if there was so much action going on, but yet still you could understand it. The writing style is wonderful, easy to understand and fun to read. Just think when you read Harry Potter you are entering into a dream world of magic and fun."
5,Sucked me in,The best children's books are those that kids love but also have meaning for adults. There are timeless and current themes about growing up. I thought I'd just take a look and see what all the fuss was about. Surprise! I was sucked in and ended up staying up all night reading the first two!
2,I was disappointed...,"I went into reading this series and seeing the movie thinking I would totally be blown away, because I'd heard so much about it. It really isn't anything spectacular at all. It's fantasy, which I'll always have a love for, but the plot is predictable and the characters are bland. There are many other fantasy books and movies that are better. I'm not saying HP is bad, or don't read it or see the movie, just don't buy the hype. This is nothing you haven't seen before. Everything about this series is completely overrated."
1,Buy and burn these horrible books!,If you buy these books it would just be a waste of money. For one thing there are going to be seven books and there is only four books in this set so wait for the horrible set of seven.Second these books are the worst books in the entire word! The first had story but then on they were horrible! Burn these books. Please vote for me.
5,I love these books,There the best books I've ever read!!! I've read all 4 of them 6 times and can't wait till the next one comes out. This is a great book for kids 10 and older even adults like it.
4,These actually get better as you go.,"I'm not much of a fan of fantasy as such. However these are so well written and so well received by kids that I think anyone who likes science fiction should read them. I still think Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is still far better for young readers, but these are very good and deserve to be as popular as they are."
5,On the Edge Fun,"This is the fourth in the Samantha Shaw series and I can't wait to find out what happens next. Sam and Angel really keep you on edge in this installment. And then there is Gabe you can feel the heat through the page between Sam and him......what is better than a little romance and alot of mystery. As always Grandpa, the boys and Ali are there with a helping hand and in Grandpa's case quick internet access (wonder if he has cable or dsl?). If you like a quick fun mystery you will love this series."
4,I am totally satisfied!,I received my item in a timely fashion and with no problems. The item came undamaged and I am totally satisfied.
3,"Good item, bad shipping","This item was a gift for a true Dark Shadows fan - a real ""Darkie"", as he refers to himself.The CD is great and made a great gift. It is unfortunate that the time from date of order until the recipient received it was almost 30 days. The item is describes as ""usually ships in 24 hours"", and even with utilizing Super Saver Shipping should have arrived in under a week. The customer service people insisted it was because of Super Saver Shipping and the scarcity of this item that there was such a delay. In fact, I ordered two different items, and each arrived in different packages on the same day. A month after the order was placed."
1,Can you say loud?,"I am not very technical when it comes to case fans, but I do have ears: these things are the loudest fans you can possibly meet. I have two in my case and everytime I turn it on, I feel the need to put earplugs in my ears. If you play music, o boy, you're gonna have to play it REALLY loud to overcome the LOUD, LOUD, LOUD fan.Pros- moves lots of air- it worksCons- loud- loud- loud"
4,EVERYTHING SOUNDS GREAT HERE!,"Remastered by the legendary Rhino engineer Bill Inglot, all the songs on Soulful Pop sound marvelous.The producers rounded up a compilation whose name well defines the contents: Soul music with a strong pop edge.One could make a case for reversing it and say it's more like pop music w/ a dash of soul.A standout jewel: The rare Jay & The Techniques hit - ""Keep The Ball Rolling""Lots of the singles here were much bigger hits in the UK than stateside, so for many, the songs will be unfamiliar. It's quite a fascinating study to compare the two countries response to different songs!(How could the classic ""Ooh Child"" by the 5 Stairsteps completely bomb in the UK, but be such a smash in the US?...and how could we have missed such a cool #1 UK cover hit of ""Everlasting Love"" by The Love Affair in America?)For the half dozen Top 20 USA hits, they probably sound their very best on this disc."
5,Useful and to the point.,This book was useful and to the point. What I like the most is that it did not take me through a bunch of code I could not understand. The author covered every aspect with very detailed explanations.
5,the Time Tunnel volume II,"Again , with a young imagination , this series , certainly fit the bill !""Hats Off to Irwin Allen !"""
5,The Time Tunnel Still Rocks,"In 1966 my sister and my self could not wait for Friday Night to watchthe ""The Time Tunnel."" My family had just purchased our first Color Television and I remember the vivid colors and incredible adventures intime. This is wonderful entertainment without bad words and a politicalagenda. It also cultivated my curiosity in historic events such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Since the screen writers went on strike and all we have to watch is reruns anyway why not enjoy something you remember and your younger family will want to see more than once. This is a fantastic addition to my DVD collection. Brovo Amazon for making this available at such a reasonable price Jay Simon - Orlando Florida"
2,"Lousy Series, Intriguing Extras","I'm not a fan of THE TIME TUNNEL and probably won't watch the episodes in this set. I bought it for the two unsold revival pilots that are included -- the unaired, 2002 hour-long THE TIME TUNNEL ""reimagining"" for Fox (which was flawed but interesting nonetheless) and the 1976 two-hour movie TIME TRAVELERS (which was awful in every way). The story for TIME TRAVELERS was written by Rod Serling, but I can't imagine that any of his work remained in the execrable final product. There wasn't hint of his intelligence, wit or characterization in the script.THE TIME TUNNEL set has a couple of nice extras but no effort is made to present them in any sort of context or with any kind of flair. The whole set feels perfunctory, slapped together with no imagination, creativity or enthusiasm. Which is, of course, the complete opposite of the DVD sets put together by Paul Brownfield...like THE WILD WILD WEST, GUNSMOKE, and THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW."
5,AWESOME!!,"I absolutly loved these cards when a really good friend of mine brought them on a trip for us. I loved them the colours, the pictures the lay outs you can do. One year I got them for Christmas and i loved them so much. I lost them in a move but I hope to get some and i am glad that Tatiana has more books and cards to look at.If you do cards have an open heart and mind. These are a great gift for someone that you know that needs some visual guidence. :)"
5,Great stuff,"This is one of the best conditioners out there. Nice smell, can leave on for a short amount of time or longer for deep cond."
1,Dissapointing,"These look very tasty and me being a candy freak i had to try them. To say the least i was extremely dissapointed. They have a chemical taste and the texture is like chewing glue. Very nasty, i would never eat or buy these again and that goes for any of the flavors."
5,Extremely Satisfying Quicky!!,"These two under 25 minute programs are ideal for the commitment phobe who still expects a fulfilling experience.This is ""express"" yoga at its best. It truly delivers what one expects from a DVD titled AM/PM of which there seem to be a million nowadays.I do believe Ravi Singh had the original AM/PM which I heard was pretty great but now with the super Ana Brettthis AM/PM is even better.I recommend doing the AM section still in your pajamas for a satisfying, gentle, yet ultimately invigorating, wake up call. You really feel like anything is possible after this gentle challenge!The PM section is best done as soon as you walk through the door in the evening for a stress releasing, soothing, get back to yourself, contented feeling.After years of hair pulling insomnia I am finally sleeping like a relaxed 5 year old on vacation!"
4,Very well written and full of details.,This book provides more detail than is generally available on the subject. Very chilling recantation of all the events before and after.
4,gripping,"This had great information about the sadist David Parker and his fiance. Cant believe his daughter got off scott free. Where were all the children of jessie and the victims while all this bar hopping, drinking and drugs were going on?"
4,It was a page turner!,"I read this book in 24 hours, and although, it is true that there are many people mentioned and at times I had to back track a little to see if I missed something, it was worth it. It wasn't so distracting that I would quit it all together, and believe me there are many books out there much, much worse. All and all I thought it was fast paced and easy to read. It is amazing to me that I'd never heard of this before, as huge as it was. And It never ceases to amaze me the atrocities that people can do to other people. It is a scary, scary, story and for the people who survived David Parker Ray, I hope you may somehow find peace."
3,So Bad It's Good,"This movie falls under ""My Guilty Pleasures"". The early scenes are set in Chicago, and it brings me some nostalgia to see how the old 'L' trains used to look. The performances in this film can be categorized as camp and overdone, esp. that of Anthony Perkins, as a high strung photographer. The clothes are pure ugly, but you have to remember that was in style back in 1975."
