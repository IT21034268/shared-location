4,Great Fantasy Read,"This first offering by Kristen Britain was suprisingly good! I enjoyed the ease of the author's writing style and ended up reading it within 3 days of purchase. The main character, Karigan, has a certain innocence about her that is endearing. Meanwhile, the reader just knows that Karigan is going to be in the middle of some fray or another, and that she will eventually triumph, regardless of her lack of confidence in her own skills. The author ends the story with just enough closure to complete this first book, however, many questions remain. I look forward to the second installation of this series. I was as thrilled with this book as I have been with Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series and Tad Williams' Green Angel Tower."
2,Average Rating: Higher Than it Deserves,"I honestly can't understand how this book got such a high rating. That's not to say it's a bad book, It's not. Maybe it even deserves 3 stars. I'll admit the story was fast paced and somewhat enjoyable. But overall the plot was predictable and too simple. I can barely remember any of the characters (besides the main one) since there wasn't anything special about them, they were just there. Perhaps the people who enjoyed this book so much like a simple story, I prefer something a little more complex, something that will make me think..."
4,An Excellent Read,"I absolutely love this book. It has such a great plot with so many twists and turns; you don't know what to expect next. The characters are well developed, but they could be better. Despite that I have already read the book three times. I just wonder when Kristen Britain will write a sequel, or even another book."
4,a truly good read,"Like many others, I picked this up, expecting a ""beach read."" What I got was an engrossing story that pulled me in right from the first chapter. A good stand-alone book, but with enough threads left dangling that I look forward to more from this author. Well done!"
3,Too Slow for Me,"Nabb has written several books in this series, but I found this particular one too slow moving. It has strong description, so it does a good job setting the scene, but I thought there was too much dialog and not quite enough action."
3,Not as nice as some of her other books,"Some of the ""baby says"" are not realistic. Who's hungry baby says ""ba-ba""? I guess my son didn't drink from a bottle long enough, but he always refers to food as ""yum-yum"". Also, some of the flaps cover the whole page and are very difficult to lift."
1,Goo Goo Ba Ba Bleh Bleh,"What DOES baby say? Not much! Although I'm fond of Ms. Katz's ""Where is Baby's Belly Button"" I was horrified by this book. What baby ""says"" is not one real word in the whole volume. What is the point of teaching your child that some babies say ""ba ba"" for bottle? Emerging speech is going to sound different on every toddler. If YOUR baby says ""ba ba"" for bottle-- that's absolutely terrific but you should follow it up with ""RIGHT! SMART GIRL! THE BOTTLE!"" and not repeat the baby talk. Baby talk is fine... as long as it comes from the baby.I promptly returned this book."
1,Archaeology and faith?,What has archaeology to do with faith? Obviously nothing. Archaeology is a social science that utilizes the scientific method. Archaeologists analyze artifacts and their distribution to help understand the lifeways of those who came before us. Whereas faith is accepting something as truth which has no evidence indicating it as such.
3,Who Was Jesus?,"I liked what I saw, but was dissapointed at the ending. they should have continued up to the present. The history of the church, the splits etc...Other than that it was ok."
5,So simple yet so AWESOME,"Boy was I surprised to see this on Amazon again when it was supposedly ""discontinued"" back in 2001. This is a very simple DVD rack but it is very effective in limiting space usage and combining quality and durability. It is very sturdy and is stackable (althought I don't recommend stacking more than two.) No double DVD case storage but its a-ok, the majority of DVDs are single case."
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother. The ScubaPro version is a rip off.You can buy this:""Adapter USB 2.0 to IrDA - Windows 7, MAC OSX Compatible MOSCHIP 7780"" through Amazon, and it works as well as the above, for only $23.95Works with my Intel-based MacBook Pro and Windows 7."
1,off the face of the earth...,"I remember buying ""Becoming X"" and loving it, Kelli has an amazing voice, and I waited for a follow-up. I never heard anything, they were never seen in videos again, and I assumed they disbanded like everyone else. Well, no wonder. Kelli leaves- no more band. Why would they TRY to carry on without her? 90% of the fans were her fans and didn't know who her little band was anyways. This sucks. Avoid at all costs."
1,Dissapointing.,"I don't like Splinter. Kelli Ali (Dayton) is awesome, and an (the??) essential component of my thorough enjoyment of Becoming X (which is nearly PERFECT [Spin Spin Sugar is the WORST of the album] and has remained in my personal top ten for a full ten years). Splinter left me feeling cold, empty and disappointed by comparison. I wasn't even aware that Kelli had been asked to leave the band when I purchased Splinter. You can only imagine my remorse when I inserted the newly purchased CD in my player. I suppose they were afraid they sounded too much like Portishead, etc., but they were much to be preferred, IMHO. I'm going to spare you the details of my personal opinion of Chris as a 'vocalist'. It's not a total loss; there are a few catchy tunes on Splinter, but I long for Kelli."
4,"""It's just your half-time vertigo""","I tend to obsess about music one song at a time, and that song for me on ""Splinter"" is Half-Life. It contains possibly the most powerful baseline I've ever heard. The swoopy trip-hop synths are great, but it's little touches like the faint Orientalist oud-like horns and tinkling chimes, and Corner's pristine voice breathing out of the speakers that make it all perfect.But that baseline! It's arresting, outrageously erotic! It's worth the CD all on its own."
1,I don't like this album.,"I am a 12 year old boy. I didn't buy this album, but I've heard the songs. If you ask me, the Spice Girls, in this album are all image and no music. This album reminds me of disco, and you can guess what I think about disco. This album shows that they can sing well, but they should be more music-oriented in thsi album."
2,It's OK.,"I've only seen the first 3 seasons of the regular show, but agree with a few other reviews - this one, while is a must watch because it is TPB, just wasn't as funny as the shows I have seen up to this point. It wasn't horrible, but I didn't laugh too much, but it was a good 90minutes of brain dead entertainment. It would be hard to watch a 2nd time though."
3,Is this movie the end for TPBoys?,"As a HUGE Trailer Park Boys fan this one was a little strange. A little disappointing & almost depressing. Not the usual ""crazy funny"" stuff from the boys. Don't get me wrong. I still think the 7 seasons are some of the best comedy ever on TV/DVD. I wish the show would just go on forever!"
4,A Nice Addition to the TBP Story,"It wasn't quite what I expected after seeing every episode and the first movie, but I did enjoy it. I liked the alternate ending and some of the deleted scenes more than I liked the actual movie, but I WAS NOT disappointed. Not to be a spoiler, but we've watched it twice now and each time we pick up on small details and characters in the background. Overall I think this was a great movie and the cast and crew did an excellent job. In the interest of continuing the TPB story, I would have liked to have seen what happened that led to the boys being in jail since everyone seemed happy at the end of the series, T and J-Roc's babies, Randy and Lucy's baby, etc. It wouldn't have needed to be big either- just have the kids around and maybe a quick cut scene to why Jim had them tossed back in and I would have thought it was perfect- that's why I only gave it four stars."
4,Funny,"Countdown to Liquor Day was funny TPB but it wasn't as funny as the series or the Christmas movie. They didn't have many Rickyisms and J Roc wasn't as crazy as he normally is. Mr. Lahey is drunk and hilarious as usual. Not the best TPB installment, but makes you wish they were still making the series."
2,hmmmm.......expensive,I've used this product on my old face now since it arrived. I look exactly the same. OLD!I would try something else not so expensive
4,Results were fast!,"I have oily skin. Usually by mid morning I am having to blot my makeup due to yucky shine. This product gave my shine a more healthier glow. I still produce shine, but I can really tell that the product works with my makeup way better than previous lotions or creams. When I put it on at night I can also tell that my skin is happy with the product since it doesn't leave my skin fealing greasy. I have only used this product for 3 straight days now and I am looking forward to more improvement in my skin with this product!Lindsay H."
1,Not as expected,"The cream is very thick and not natural. It does not moisturize as described. Normally, amazon reviews are very accurate but it was not the case for this product."
5,Eb5 facial cream,"It only takes a little of the cream for your face. It keeps your skin soft. It is the only facial cream that I can put over my eye lids without it burning my eyes. Any other facial cream, if I put over my eye lids will just set my eyes to burning and tearing. This is a great product."
1,Legal Actions,"I reviewed both the positive and negative responses of the customers eb5 facial cream. A few people had negative comments, but 120 customers stated that eb5 really works. So I tried it for 5 days, but stopped when I noticed that the product was making my forehead more wrinkled, and causing tiny pumps. I went from 1 wrinkle to a forehead full of wrinkles. Obviously this was a trick. I think that the 120 positive responses were put there by people who work for the company. Its dishonest and they should pay. I wish I could give them a negative scare."
2,very disappointed,I was looking for a good moisturizer and this wasn't it. My make-up does not apply smoothly with this product...Is very dry.
4,a question to user of eb5,I have more of a question but have been using eb 5 for a bout a week . I was hoping to find out if the eb 5 you women are using has a think waxy consistency to it. I do like the the one I bought is fragrance free it doesn't sting my face I have very dry skin . I feel as though its waxy and sits on top of my skin an not totally adsorb. mine could be old jar they sent to me .Thank I do like but afraid I might of got an old jar .
4,Portrait of the Artist as a Young Fish,"This is a highly inventive novel that seems to lose its way halfway through as the author starts throwing in any creative image that comes his way whether it fits the character or not. A good example is ""I have stolen songs from God,"" a phrase that (while beautiful) bears on nothing in the plot or character. This book is somewhat of cross between TRISTAN SHANDY and MARTIN DRESSLER and is strikingly original but meandering. The best scenes are those involving The Commandant and his ambition for creating a world as big as his ego. The results are hilarious, as is the final achievement of the Surgeon with his phrenology specimens: a last laugh at science and scientific humanism.There is obvious affinity here with Celine's JOURNEY TO THE END OF NIGHT--a novel similar in style, narration and world view. Flanagan does not suffer by comparison."
5,Sure Miss Zero,"What a great soundtrack and what a great play. Once you reacquaint yourself with it, you will be singing and humming the tunes for weeks and weeks....you just can't help it."
4,Good recording,"Having just seen the Broadway show Fiddler on the Roof, starring Theodore Bikel, I bought the CD as a memento from the day. I found the music on this particular recording quite good, yet somehow it wasn't as good as I had remembered the music in the actual show to be. Maybe it is just the acoustics of the Colonial Theatre that make the voices sound so good, but I was slightly disappointed in these voices. It is particularly evident in Matchmaker, when some of the high notes sung by Chava and Tzitzel are a little flat. Many people have reviewed this CD based on their opinions of the movie soundtrack. Having never seen the movie nor heard the soundtrack, I really do not know if this really is a disappointing CD compared to the movie soundtrack. However, as far as I am concerned, this CD is a good buy as the songs are well sung for the most part."
2,Not as large as I was expecting,"It says it's a large toy, but it is very small. They should have better dimensions on the page. Good quality just too small"
2,Not as sturdy as other Kyjen toys,"We buy Kyjen toys almost exclusively because they last longer and are much better made than most other dog toys. We have a small dog and although he does like to chew on his toys, he is not a crazy chew machine, and Kyjen toys normally last at least three months before he is able to destuff them. We purchased Homer to replace another Kyjen hedgehog that we had purchased at PetCo (the previous one was two shades of gray, and not as brown as Homer, and also had no grunter). The other hedgehog lasted a super long time. Our dog ripped Homer open at a weak seam within 10 minutes, and pulled out the grunter and the rattle. We stitched him back together, and expect him to last a little longer, but we were VERY disappointed in the quality of this particular Kyjen product.Maybe we just got a lemon, but we will be much more likely to purchase Kyjen toys in the store instead of on Amazon so that we can check the seams first."
2,squeaker,my dog has already broke the squeaker the first day she had it. I dont think i will buy it again.
5,Intense,"The overall strength of Williams' work lies in his power to summon image from where there was previously nothing.Forget about the conventional tactics of poetry (meter, rhyme, etc.). Williams effectively occupies the outer regions of the land which is not prose. His power always properly lay in the simple yet vivid images (visual, aural, tactile, etc.) behind the words."
4,A fabulous show excellently recorded with very good voices:),"I simply adore the emotion packed onto this one little CD. The story line is intriguing, the characters seem real, and them music -- well, get it for yourself. It's simply astounding!"
1,"Little valuable information, lacking vital elements",I was looking for some guidance on building and application using the eBay API. This book was a disappointment because it talks about the eBay API in general terms at high level only. The book also has a shortage of examples.
5,Love their music,I don't know how anyone could give BMT a bad review. I love their music. Both CDs that I have are on my favorites list. Everyone has different opinions.
1,Terrible,"I bought one, it arrived non-functional. Returned with no hassle, replacement shipped very quick. New one arrived, worked when I first needed it. Went to adjust timing a month or so later and light no longer works. Choose another light."
4,Pretty good timing light for the money,"Works well, dial makes it easy to read timing. Only thing I would change is to make the light a little brighter. Light is bright enough to work, but in bright sunlight it kind of washes out."
2,disappointing,"After reading all the great reviews, I was anxious to receive this DVD. I love religious history, especially of the reformation. I love the stories of Wycliffe and Tyndale, and the books I have read about them I couldn't put down. This DVD lacks the intrigue and suspense of the story. I fell asleep about two-thirds of the way through it. The date says 2004, but it appears to be much older. I think that must be the date that the DVD was released, and probably it was actually filmed in the 80s (just my guess). The background music is very annoying. (An attempt, I think at using period music, but it doesn't work for setting the tone and emotional feel of the film.) Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought this would be of the same caliber as the recent Luther DVD starring Fiennes. Unfortunately it wasn't even close."
5,A Law Enforcement Officer's Guide to Testifying in Court,"One stressful aspect of police work is testifying in court. In the past, testifying has been a skill that was often learned by experience only. Mr. Vukelic has written a text that will help guide a new, or seasoned police officer, through often-complicated process involving giving testimony or depositions. He offers easy to understand advice, practical tips on how to prepare for court, as well as what to expect and what to do once on the stand. A must for every law enforcement officer's library."
1,The Perilous Rebirth of JM Keynes,"For one reason or another, John Maynard Keynes is still revered as the economist par excellance of the twentieth century, even though his policies of interventionism have been thoroughly discredited. Krugman nevertheless carries Keynes's interventionist torch (a bad metaphor, I know) and advocates a rational economic order. When will clearly smart people realize -- not the least of which Krugman -- that a centrally planned economy can only work during wartime? The benefits of spontaneous market economies, as espoused by Hayek and Von Mises (two of the most obscenely overlooked and underrated minds of the 20th century), have been empirically proven again and again. Krugman makes me believe that we are again, sadly, on the Road to Serfdom."
5,Dead Men Come to Life,"Dear Amazon,I just finished The Deep Dark by Gregg Olsen and found it to be riveting from the first page to the last. I was that 1st Lietenant mentioned in the book and have wondered about many details of the disaster since it happened. Greg Olsen was able to bring some of my old friends from that period back to life for me and allowed me to be re-acquainted with them through his book.I felt some of the closeness and love that I had for many of the men come back to me while reading the book, and for that I am very grateful.I would recommend Greg's book to anyone who would like a deeper understanding of mining and how incredible common everday people can be, when the chips are down and it really counts.A stellar work by an incredible writer.Regards,Lee HaynesSmelterville, Idaho"
5,Deep Dark-daily reality,"I have read many books on the disaster, afterall this is my hometown. I am a miner's daughter. I have felt the fear involved with the danger of mining. My grandfathers worked for the Bunker and the Coeur at the time of this fire. Many of their friends were among the dead. This book seemed to put me right into the middle of it. It gave a true and honest picture of life in the valley when mining was great and plentiful. This is a story that still lives on today in the valley, people have never forgotten those who died or those who survived. Life did change after the fire, miners were more careful, more aware, but they still go down day after day with the thought in the back of their minds that they may never see daylight again. This book allows the outside world, those not from the valley, to see the life these men lived. Thank you."
1,Broken,I needed my Motorola radios today but they were defective and I am still waiting for Motorola to get moving and send me a replacement set. Buy Cobra or Midland.
3,Hello...? Hello...? Hello?,"Very nice looking pair of radios, but distance was not impressive. Walking in a residential area which was relatively flat, the radios maybe had distance of about 3/4 mile before transmission began breaking up. That was disappointing considering the advertising suggested ""upto 5 miles."" Maybe they tested them in the middle of the Arizona desert or something. I'm probably going to return these and try to get something with greater range."
3,Broken Belt Clip,"The radios work great, but the belt clip is very fragil and broke on the first day we used it."
3,Licenses have zero to do with range,The idiot who posted that a license is required to get the range is just plain wrong. The FCC can no more regulate the range of the radio than it can the weather. The license is required to operate the radio - it is **PERMISSION** from the government to share in the frequency range this unit covers. Pfft. Some folks...
1,Pretentious and Silly,"This album blew. The lyrics are childish and the music is derivative. I love all of the bands Amazon has hooked this album up with, but the recommendations are misleading -- despite the 5 starts, this CD is a waste of money."
4,Bringing it down a notch,"Dr. Nygren is right to praise Celibidache for his excellent insight into this work, but good as it is, I have to quibble a little bit.As was so often the case, Celibidache here puts up with an orchestra that is not up to standard, though I surmise it plays over its usual capabilities due to inspiration from the maestro. Winds in particular are snaggly, the percussion sometimes inaccurate...the same problems Knappertsbusch had to deal with years earlier in recording Bruckner with the MPO.We can be glad though that Celibidache at least got this orchestra--if he'd have had to do this in Italy with one of the atrociously overworked RAI orchestras, which are contemporary music specialists to boot, the results would probably have been more uneven.All told, though, this is a worthwhile release, highly enjoyable, and a dynamic testament for the interpretative insight of a wonderful conductor."
3,Coleman Double Not,"It really is OK for house guests. The name was misleading for me; I thought i was ordering a Double width instead of Queen size. My fault. It does wrap up easily for storage. On the other hand, the thing loses pressure over the course of 24 hours and needs to be pumped up each night. In short, I wish I had chosen another brand, perhaps not so tall. It seems that no manufacturers produce a Double/Full width; nothing between Single/Twin and Queen size."
5,"Quick, Comfortable, Compact for Storage","We bought one of these to sleep on temporarily when we moved and had to wait a couple of weeks for our stuff to arrive. It was very comfortable. The AC powered Coleman Pump (sold separately) fills it in minutes. The non-slip velvet-like top keeps the sheets from working loose. When guests come to stay, they prefer this queen sized airbed to the queen sized sleeper sofa that cost hundreds more for the sleeper option. It rolls up into its own attached bag with a handle and stores easily in a closet. It is also perfect for traveling and more comfortable than a cheap hotel rollaway bed. FYI, when filled up it is larger than a standard queen sized mattress since it has curved sides to give you support from rolling off in your sleep. Also when deflating it, Do Not Wrinkle it to get the air out. Pull the plug and let it deflate. Then it will fold easily, roll up, and fit back in its roll up bag."
2,Loses Air,"Never was able to sleep a full night on this mattress without having to reinflate. When coming home from a camping trip and unpacking, unfortunately, calling about the air mattress leak has never been the first thing on my mind, so now that I am finally thinking about it, the warranty period has passed. Would not recommend."
3,"Due to rubber coating, you have to apply considerable force!","Rubber coating makes them much more harder to bend, so when you're just holding a screwdriver, you hand gets same pressure, as it would when holding a large hammer - rubber coating tries to flatten."
3,Gift,I've had this book for years and like it. This copy was a gift for a friend and I haven't heard from her as to weather she likes it or not.
2,The Pillsbury Cookbook,this book has the recipies but is one of the most poorly presented cookbooks yet to be printed. No graphics and the layout is totally monotone - making the information presented distasteful and hard to follow.
4,"A great ""study guide"" for resolving marital issues",This book is designed to lead a group of married couples through some of the real-life issues faced in marriage. I found it to be well written and uses illustrations that any couple could relate to. We use it in a Church marriage class setting and it works very well.
4,ABOUT THIS EDITION,"This is a masterpiece, fundamental in understanding Mexico within its historical perspective. The text adds the interest of being an edition contemporary to the events being described, thanks to photostatic reproduction. Therefore, the lack of care that the editors show, is quite dissapointing: many a page appears stained and slopping. Clearly the original copy has been borrowed from a public library, as the editos have, all the same, copied shelf labels and rubber stamping!"
4,156 Ways,no longer have to read long books by one CEO! How the author got 100 honest CEOs is beyond me. But he did. 156 wys real good ones! I'm a middle manager with 155 people who report to me and this book was very very helpful and gave me some great food for thought.
5,Christmas Gift,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. The shipping was faster than I had expected and in like brand new condition.
1,This Cable is no good,I can't comment on the quality of sound because the cable's connectors are not designed correctly and will not stay connected once you plug it in and release it. It pops right out! This problem happens on both the output and the input on my home theater system so I know it is a problem with the cable itself.
4,it works,Received in 3 days. Item is as described. Noticed like another buyer that it is somewhat loose in attaching but since the unit is static do not see any issues.
3,"Good sound, poor fit.","The cable works just fine. My only issue is the poor fit at the terminal. It is really loose, and falls out with minimal effort."
3,Terrific,"My father read this story to me and now I have read it to my own children. I have never forgotten it, and I hope they don't either."
2,Swiss Family Killing Spree,"I started reading this to my 6 and 8 year old, and got about 5 chapters into it before I started to doubt my choice of reading material for these kids. For one thing, the language is archaic and hard to wrap your mouth around. But for another, the values expressed in this 300 year old book are a bit disturbing. The God-fearing family runs aground on an idyllic island full of naturally growing fruits and vegetables, and arrives with supplies aplenty to draw from, but within a week they have slaughtered at least a dozen creatures. Seems to me the main theme of the book is ""man's dominance over nature."" Doesn't work for me."
2,Maybe better in the original language,"I just can't get into this book, even though I've tried. I know it was written long ago, and in a different language, but the dialogue is just ridiculous. Other classics that I've enjoyed presented similar hurdles, but this one was just too much. Perhaps the fact that I'm not 10 years old anymore (or 20, or...) didn't help. I wanted to enjoy this like I enjoyed my recent first reading of Robinson Crusoe, but it wasn't to be. Maybe you'll love it, but I abandoned it after several chapters and gave it over to my 8yr old, who hasn't been tempted to read it yet."
5,excellent reading!,"Swiss Family Robinson is a classic everyone should read. It is fiction with a lesson. It teaches morals, integrity, as well as stimulating the imagination. I think it would be a valuable lesson for all of us to live that way for a while."
4,A Great Adventure,The Swiss family Robinson is a great book that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is a little slow in the beging but once it gets started it's great. When you read The Swiss Family Robinson you will constantly be thinking could you survive if so how. If you liked the T.V. show surviver this is a must Read!
4,Fun game with multiple strategies,"This is a fun game with constantly evolving dynamics and just enough chance to keep the more familiar player from having any severe advantage while still supporting multiple strategies Should you attempt to break off your own continent or over-take the master continent through breeding? Should you advance your own objectives or thwart those of an opponent? Should you save your drowning dinosaurs when the land shifts below them, or recoup their population counts to breed elsewhere? These are most of the issues you will continually be evaluating as the continents continue to shift, divide and join.As previously mentioned it is difficult to keep track of the tiles without a grid but that said it does not overly inhibit the fun of the game since the distance from center only comes into play maybe every 10 turns on average and even then it is only an issue in the latter stages of the game."
4,Changed the way I eat!,"As a trainer, aerobics instructor and 5/dy/wk worker outer, I too just came across this book. What made me buy it was the fact that the authors said this diet can increase your performance...well, I have only lost about 3lbs in 2wks, however it is easy to follow, and I find I can work out harder than usual. I know I am following the right eating plan, but I am hungry sometimes, which I dont like. The diet should be amended for those who exercise frequently or the athlete because sometimes you do feel like you are starving. But for those of you looking to make a change, this plan is easy and the meals are great!"
4,40-30-30- fat burning nutrition,"I stumbled across this book by accident. Probably the best accident of my life. The book was an easy read, easy to follow, and the plan works outstanding. I have lost almost 45lb in the last 4 months, and thats with holiday cheating included. The science and theories were very interesting and really made alot of sense the way they were presented. The meal plans are clear, and include more meals and more food then I had eaten prior to the plan. I loved the sample menu planners and especially the food guide which allows you to make any substitutions you want to achieve the same result.The theory and the whole plan are basic enough, that it allowed me, after just a week or two, to ""know"" what I was supposed to be eating and I have pretty much stopped using the book as a reference all together. But the pounds just keep falling off!"
4,Great source!,"I purchased this book as a resource when I began choreographing a production of ""Chicago"". The perspective from one of his main dancers is very interesting, getting insights about how the various shows and specific dance numbers were created. Definitely a good book for a dancer's or choreographer's collection!"
3,not bad cool blues guitar riff,a shame souljah slim had to get shoty but still this was'nt a bad song.
4,The Greatest Sermon Ever: The Divine Conspiracy,"The Divine Conspiracy, by Dallas Willard, is a wonderful book and is helpful for understanding Jesus' Sermon on the Mount in Matthew's gospel. This book also helps the reader to draw close to Jesus in a personal relationship through a deeper understanding of who He is through His teachings in chapters five, six, and seven of the gospel of Matthew. Dallas Willard unpacks ""The Divine Conspiracy"" by unpacking the greatest sermon ever preached, The Sermon on the Mount.This book comes highly recommended!"
5,Great book!,This is a great book for anyone who is a believer and even for those who non-believers. This one is hard to put down.
5,Like a Hearty Stew,"The Divine Conspiracy has left me with an increased desire for Jesus, and him alone. It's one of the few Christian books that I can honestly say has left me thirstier for Him than I was before. It's a ""hearty stew"" of a book that fills you up with the goodness of God, alerts you to the knowledge of the depravity of man, and sets us firmly on the utter reality of the present hope of Christ. Don't try to read this book fast. Let it sink in...it might actually take you months to finish it. But it's worth it, and is a satisfying accompaniment as you live your life...because that's what Jesus is really concerned about."
3,Disappointed...,"Willard's treatment of the Beatitudes is quite strange, and his readibility proves to be a chore. I was disappointed, and found the book to be over-rated."
2,Check this one out of the library.....,"I purchased this book based upon the reviews from amazon.com and a Christian magazine ""pick list"". Given the excellent reviews, this book was not what I expected. While I admire the depth and breadth of material Dallas is trying to cover, the book suffers from poor readability. (For a readability comparison, check out Lucado's ""Just Like Jesus"" book). Given lots of patience, I have no doubt that one can learn quite a bit from Dallas Willard's writings. Unfortunately, that much patience is ""not one of my virtues""."
4,Interesting Twist,"At first it was hard for me to get into the book. I'm not normally a Sci-Fi reader. However, the writer kept my attention and I found it and interesting and well written book. Some of the details were a bit hard for me to visualize but it really didn't take away from the story."
3,A bit to fluid of a rock,"Changing the past to make things work out is a sci fi standard, but inevitably a slippery slope to convolution and possible sprained brain. This book was fun to read with pretty decent, albeit formulaic characters. It was enjoyable and intriguing trying to put the pieces together. But it pushed too much into too short a timeframe to allow one to suspend reality and go with the action. The ending left too many ""Wha!?!?!"" sensations. Characters couldn't be where they ended up if other characters were where they were (Hawkins for sure and Levy possibly). The politices of human hormones overriding the common good was well presented and allowed for some hope for our future. And it kept you reading."
3,Good story but a bit unbelievable,This book was reasonably quick read but the premise of the story was not believable. The connection of people who could advance so quickly from nuclear weapons to time travel is just hard to fathom.
3,"Dora bath toys, bath squirters","My daughter (2 years old) loves these Dora bath toys however they are on the smaller side. Also, if you are looking for a good squirt toy , this is NOT it. I found that you have to squeeze really hard and they only seem to squirt water out if they are held upside down. Its worth the money since my daughter does play with them daily."
2,Too Small!,"I read the reviews for this product AFTER I ordered them. The toys are much smaller than I expected, and they don't do a good job of squirting water out. My twins played with them at first because they love Dora, but were bored soon afterward."
3,hi,"I just want to say that yes, a snobby listener may be able to enjoy this album, and although I don't remember most of the tracks down to details, I will always have ""Green Machine"" stuck in my head due to listening to it obsessively during a period of shifting and change. Bye for now.Evan"
3,It's Fun but not so Trick...,"Fun, I will agree with that part of the album title, but you need to be careful how often you play this disc, it can get old fast. Never heard The Apples in Stereo? They have a similar feel to that of ""Pavement"" playing the greatest hits of the Go Go's or ""Cracker"" playing School house rock. It's happy it's fun, it's not going to challenge you musically. It might be just what the doctor ordered, it might be like the same joke that made you laugh in grade school. Oh yeah, I remember when milk shot out of my nose."
5,Get this CD!,I had heard this song in a movie & had wanted it since! Love everything about this CD & would recommend this to someone who is interested! So worth it!
4,Enjoyable,"I like most songs on this CD, I found it to be enjoyable an would be willing to listen to other CDs by Ms. Russell."
1,The Book of Boredom,"I've read most of Felice Picano's books and short stories, and was eagerly waiting his new book. What a major disappointment! I could not believe the same author of such a work as ""Like People In History"" wrote this mess! It may be fascinating for those ""in the know"" concerning his association with the Violet Quill, but for the the 99.99% of us... who cares? Trying to keep track of all the characters and their associations with each other gave me a headache! Good reading if you have a case of insomnia..this is one book I had to force myself to finish."
2,"2.5* Pleasant, but self-involved","I enjoyed this as a pleasant read, but it seemed self-involved - was Picano having someone go through all his papers, cataloguing, &c. at the time he was writing this? The intricacies of academic research were repeated too often: I scanned many, many pages to get to the point. I loved ""Like People in History""."
2,Wasn't my favorite,"I usually enjoy Castaneda's books, and have found some of them moving, but I've gotta say that I had a tough time getting through this one. Fiction or not, to me this book seemed like a forced rehash of his earlier work, with a dash of women's power added in an effort to keep it current. Of course, it's also possible that I just wasn't getting it. In fact, that's why I stopped by this board. I wanted to see if I was the only one in the world that didn't really enjoy the book or get much out of it."
2,"a fancy table, but no meal","Coming from the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, and loving each one of those, I find this book much more in the point-and-smirk vein than the open-hearted generosity of the former series. I thought for one chapter that von Iglefeld could grow on me, but it never happened. Some of the characters get interesting, but you don't get enough time with them. The overall story is more of a hair than a thread, but that wouldn't be a problem if there were some heart in this book. The one thing that saved the book from being just awful was the deliciously textured descriptions of the varied locales. Sadly, the thing I enjoyed most was finding the non-word ""defintitely"" on the back cover."
3,Allergy Warning - May cause itchy reaction.,"I know i'm not the first to complain about itch after showering with a Caress product, but I felt the need to let others know my situation, for the last few nights I've been showering with this, and i've been suffering daily itching all over my body....So if you believe you have sensitive skin or allergies, I recommend you pass up this product, otherwise it is a great bodywash that smells nice and not too overpowering."
4,Older book with valid information,"This is not a recent book, but I am finding it to be more useful than some other cactus and succulent books that are recently published. The photos have proven to be helpful. I was able to identify several large specimens in some private gardens with the photos.Recommend."
3,Alright,The balls don't really screw on they just kind of sit on the ends. It is so long it gets caught on my clothes. Maybe all pregnancy ones are like that. I am not sure.
4,Steinman going a bit experimental,"I really dig Steinman's writing generally. And some of the tracks on this are just incredible. And Ellen Foley's voice - Whoa mama! Wotta voice! Almost makes ""My Little Red Book"" sound good despite the writing!The thing is, this CD has some fantastic music, done as Steinman envisioned it. It's worth the price of entry. But parts of it, several tracks, are just annoying. Too experimental, or purely spoken word. For most artists, that's par for the course... how many albums do you like every track on? But for Steinman, that's a step down.Still, a necessary member of your collection, simply because of the gems."
3,So where's the Meatloaf track?,"I tried to do careful research to find ""It's All Coming Back to Me Now"" that featured Meatloaf. Thought this was it! It wasn't. Not the seller's fault (it got to me real fast!), but I'm not keeping it! Yeah, I'm a fan of Jim Steinman, but I listened to the other tracks and wasn't thrilled. ""Good for Bad"" (I had on LP, no less!) was much better, I thought. Suggest you listen to track samples on-line before you buy. It's up to the individual to decide what's good!"
1,Kidde Firex Smoke Alamr PE120,"My landloard replaced my smoke alarm with this model. He had a hard time getting the unit to stop chirping after he installed the battery and hooked it up to the electricity. He finally got it stopped. But the alarm has been chirping, on and off, like there was a problem with the battery again. Not a fan of this unit or the fact that it doesn't have a hush button."
1,Possible fire hazard with these detectors.,"Warning: Possible fire hazard with these units!Our fire alarms went off at 2:00 in the morning and would not shut off. There was no apparent smoke or fire in the house, so I took the alarms out of the ceiling one at a time (six of them). After removing the 5th one, the alarm stopped, so I reinstalled the other 4 and they appear to be working OK.I disassembled the problem detector and found that one of the resistors had blown out leaving a scorch mark inside the detector. Had there been any dust or hair buildup, this might have caused a fire.The detectors were about 7 years old, but this type of defect is not acceptable in this type of device.I will be replacing all of them with another model."
2,Not as good as other Kidde wired smokes,"A few months ago I replaced all the smoke detectors in my house with new Kidde ones: ionization, ionization+photoelectric, and ionization+carbon monoxide. They're great, but I decided to change out the one in my kitchen for this photoelectric-only one because I was getting too many false alarms there. This one is not the same quality as the other ones. I didn't realize it couldn't be hushed until it went off yesterday -- big minus. We're not getting false alarms so much now when cooking, but at least with the other one we could silence it with the touch of a button. Now it's a real headache. Also this one's not as easy to fit into the mounting ring as the others, doesn't have a front battery door, and generally feels cheaper. I thought I'd be getting something similar but I was disappointed."
4,Actron CP9145,This product does not have capability to get updates from your computer. Great tool however.
3,Outdated PC Interface and Software,"In the other reviews, you get all the positive aspects of the device; all of which are true. It's got a good display; vehicle list is updated, etc., etc. It's nearly idiot proof.But beware: if you want communication between the scanner and a computer, this is not the scanner to purchase. The device has a RS-232 serial connection; leaving the user stranded with outmoded technology. It appears the user can print directly to a printer, but it has to be a serial printer. I didn't know serial printers were still being manufactured!I'm sure with more research, I could figure out how to link the device with my PC; but then what software would I use? The OBDII diagnostic software included with the device is also lacking. With big, blocky letters, limited pull down menus, and a cheesy VW Bug icon it appears to be written for the Win-3.x OS.I give it Two Stars less than perfect for Actron CP9145 for poor connectivity and software."
3,Works on UK cars,"My wife bought me this for my 03 PT Cruiser CRD and it worked fine. Also tested on an 04 Corsa CDTI and a Nissan X trail. It read all cars without a problem. Unfortunately all were healthy so could not try the reset facility.Note.. As far as I can see it does not appear to reset the ""maintenance due indicator"" which is a big minus for me. Hence 3 stars, If I'm wrong then 5 stars."
2,Great design poor quality on arrival,"Chose the Actron CP9145 after reading many reviews on other products and the full actron line, so I ordered one. Upon arrival at the shop the first problem I noticed was there was no 9 volt battery included with the kit. After a trip to the store to buy a battery I read all the instructions and started to use it. Turns out mine was defective, along the top 4 rows of the LCD display there was a block of cells where no numbers or letters would display. Blank spot, nothing there at all. This rendered data interpretation impossible. No local repair, no download fix, sorry! If it had this error, quite obvious on start up and should have been caught prior to leaving the factory, what else was wrong and lurking within? I returned the unit for a full refund and am now looking for a different manufacturer. Case also seemed light and unpadded so what out for that drop to the shop floor. May work great if you get a good one, but I would look at alternatives too."
5,PAID FOR ITSELF,"This is the greatest product ever. I bought it for my husband for christmas and has already paid for itself twice over. Had problems with two vehicles that had engine lights that kept coming on, as you know a garage will charge at least 75.00 just to hook you car up to their tester. well my husband plugged in the autoscanner and it instantly showed the code and we solved the problems in both vehicles for almost nothing and cleared the engine light code so they could be inspected in new york state. Would recommend this product to anyone who has some knowledge of automobiles, but even if you dont it saves you the cost of the diagnosis,easy to plug in to your car or truck and gives you a code thats easy to look up and see what the problem is. GREAT PRODUCT PAYS FOR ITSELF OVER AND OVER EASY TO USE"
5,Very Good!,"When I saw my brother playing this game it didn't look very good neither did it look fun or look very easy, but when I played, it was very fun and was kind of easy. One of the reasons I like it is because you can have a partner with you. I'm mostly Luigi and my partner is Mario and we just go around beating everybody. There are four kinds of tennis courts that you can use, 1 hard, which has normal speed and strong bounce, 2 clay, which has slow speed and weak bounce, 3 grass, which has fastest speed and weak bounce, 4 compostition, which has fast speed and normal bounce."
1,Not what I expected at all.,"First of all if you are wanting to play a Mario Tennis game..is is not it at all. Its an RPG game about a male or female character that you create and then name. This is not a ""plug and play"" game. You will have to go through so much dialogue and walk around talking to many characters before you even get a chance to...play tennis. The game tries to create a drama about a tennis club that is not needed at all. In short if you are a fan of Mario Tennis games, this is NOT for you. If you are a fan of RPG games that for some random reason toss in tennis at some points...then this is your game."
4,Old mystery lover,I'm a fan of the old black and white movies. It brings back memories of being a kid again. I've loved them all.
4,One of the greatest shows on Earth,"Rock extroardinaires, the Billy Nayer Show, were an intensely intriguing musical and film-making force during the 90's and early millenium. This is their most celebrated film, featuring several of their earlier shorts. While they certainly are not anything like your average rock band, one cannot knock the hustle and creativity of The Billy Nayer Show."
3,Streamers with no POM POM,"That old saying you get what you pay for. In this case it's so very true. They actually look better in the picture than when you get them. I wouldn't buy them again nor recommend them. However, my daughter was happy with them & that's really all that matters so I'm giving them 3 stars."
1,Not worth the money,"Bought it because of the lower price. Now I know why it is cheaper. After using it about ten times, the side latch broke. Now I am stuck with it, can't get a refund so am going to have to buy another one. Buy a Graco. not an Evenflo."
1,Too flimsy,"I thought evenflo had pretty good products, until I got this playpen!The mat that goes in bottom is way too thin. There may be 1/8 inch of padding, IF you're lucky. Also, one of the side/corners is coming unstitched."
1,this album makes live albums sound like studio albums,"what I mean by that, these guys have no talent what so ever. Its like they picked up thire insterments for the first time.they sound so awful, because they sound like little kids are playing, for the first time.Hope my review hlped."
4,Not like the picture,"Well I bought this for my daughter and what do you know like almost all the other reviews about the Barbie fashions...the clothing I got was not like the picture that is advertisting it! The clothing is cute though but if they are selling something, they should have the correct picture potraying the item that is for sale. Other than that it is a lot of cute Barbie clothing for a fairly good price. Now if only they sold Skipper and Ken clothing on Amazon.com. :)"
3,Has not aged well,Even back when it came out I did not undesrtand the enthusiasm of the reviewers (5 stars in Rolling Stone). There is some interesting stuff and they play in an innovative way. For me it was allways soemwhat too stiff and I still do not like it that much...
5,very listenable pop lp-but let us not overstate its significance,"when I bought this lp in '79 i wasnt so much astounded by it's newness(one must consider the deluge of new music at the end of the dour 70's) as i was by the GOF's approach to rhythmic angularity. what moved me was the sound-especially ""great men"" which momentarily (and to wonderful effect) distorted the premise of funk syncopation-no doubt this group has influenced a multitude of ""bad"" white punk/funk bands, however, let us not forget GOF's significant others: contortions, a certain ratio, esg, liquid liquid, rip rig panic, glaxo babies, pop group, slits...all equally important (if one thinks in those terms)."
4,Excellent Mystery,"I have to say, I really enjoyed Babes in the Wood, which is the first Ruth Rendell I have ever read. I imagine, based on some of the reviews I have read here, that there are other novels in the Inspector Wexford series that are stronger, but as I have no frame of reference for this series, other than this one novel, I cannot comment as to that. What I can comment to is the fact that Babes in the Woods is a well-written, well-plotted and well-paced mystery. It kept me guessing throughout the novel and the ending made sense without being predictible or overly foreshadowed. The story concerns the disappearance of two teens and their adult babysitter over the course of a rainy weekend. Their mother returns home and jumps to the conclusion that the pair have drowned. As the novel continues, there are many other conclusions reached and discarded, leads followed and abandoned. Babes in the Wood is an excellent mystery and an enjoyable read."
2,Soggy,"Sub-par Rendell, with characters who are difficult to distinguish from each other, a meandering plot, little narrative drive and no memorable writing. Wexford's daughter Sylvia has yet more man trouble in her life as a sub-plot. There's also some sort of odd Christian Druid cult that was not particularly convincing. Is there anything really like this in Britain? What one mainly remembers about this tale is that it rained a great deal during the investigation and everyone got wet. Much inferior to her earlier Wexfords and even 2007's Not in the Flesh, something of a rebound."
3,Slow-moving mystery,"Inspector Wexford is called upon to investigate the disappearance of two young teenagers and their babysitter. The teens' parents are an unlikeable couple who are out of town for the weekend and return to find their house empty. After some investigation, Wexford finds that there is suspicion that the father is being abusive to the daughter Sophie, and the son, Giles, is involved with a fundamentalist religious group. Through interminable chapters, the investigation drags on and at last a body is found in a deserted car. This discovery only leads to more questions which are finally answered by people who were nearby when the crime was committed. Perhaps die-hard Ruth Rendell fans will find this book interesting, but to me it was very slow-moving."
4,Only is a hot new single fron Nine Inch Nails with a better video,"The ""Only [Import Single]"" is a great addition to most hard-core Nine Inch Nails fans. ""With Teeth"" was not accepted nearly as well as his past albums, especially after he hyped his own music. --+-- ""Only"" is in my opinion a great song. It has the potential to be another ""Head Like A Hole"" or maybe ""Wish,"" although not as big as say ""Closer."" This also includes ""The Hand That Feeds [DFA Mix]"" and ""Love Is Not Enough [live]."" Although ""Love Is Not Enough"" is listed as a live song, it is actually taped ""live"" during a rehearsal secion for the new tour with a handful of people watching on. The only think I reccommend: IFifIFIFIF IF you are going to buy this, spend the same amount and get the German Import Version also called ""[Enhanced]"" which includes a copy of the video. If you aren't a huge nine inch nails fan, then but ""With Teeth"" (it's cheap) and think about it. Otherwise, complete your collection and get both."
3,Calamity Jane,"With all due respects to Ms. Day, the reason I bought this was because I thought it was the SOUNDTRACK which implies that Howard Keel would be on the tracks. My favorite being his rendition of the Black Hills. I was VERY VERY disappointed that he was not. Ms. Day's singing is great, but there should be a disclaimer that it is NOT the SOUNDTRACK."
2,This would make good freeware,"This is the type of product that makes you scratch your head wondering whether it was worth the purchase or not. It really doesn't add much beyond the normal filtering capabilities of MS Outlook or Outlook Express. You have to invest the time to set up rules for filtering in order to make it halfway decent. There's nothing to distinguish it from the plethora of other anti-spam software out there.McAfee recently purchased the rights to a competing anti-spam product, which many feel is a superior product (Spam Assassin). Hopefully they will use the technology to improve on Spamkiller in the future."
5,Best History/Geography book ever,"I found this book at Mardel's about a year ago and have purchased 2 additionals thru Amazon for gifts. I love this book. It has outstanding color graphs, charts, and maps of the entire history of the Bible. The best way to describe this book is as a highschool geography book focused on the Bible. The book has a vast amount of history to it. I love how it goes into the history and culture of the people groups surrounding Israel. The book explains in detail information about the Phillistines, Asyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, etc and the roles they played in the shaping of Israel. The pictures bring the history to life. I would recommend this book to anyone studying the Bible and want to understand what life was like for the people they are reading about."
5,Bible Atlas,I had viewed the book before and knew it was what I was looking for. It is a great book !
3,Great product. Disappointed one of the glass's were broken upon arrival.,"This is an excellent item and was delivered relatively quickly, however upon arrival, i noticed the box was pretty beat up. I opened the box and opened the case to see that all of the accessories were all strewn about and out of place along with pieces of broken glass everywhere. Other than one of the glass' being broken and the case being messy, it is a good product and serves its purpose."
3,travel bar,"Coundn't find the smaller bar wanted, but this is a nice one even though it's a little large for my needs"
1,Trash,"Dreamkeepers: A Spirit-Journey into Aboriginal AustraliaThis author says at the beginning that he has been accused of trying to steal Dreamtime stories, and warned to get his own Dreamtime, a concept he has no understanding of, not a clue. Most of the book is about him trying to find the Dreamtime and sad stories of the Aborigine problems. Even the title of the book is pathetically self-promoting and presumes or insinuates that he has some of significance to say about the Dreamtime. Don't be fooled by his blathering and dishonest marketing.The obligatory one star is way too much for this book: I am going to throw the book out in order to assure other people wont read my copy."
3,No Scrubs,"No scrubs almost describes exactly the scene every weekend in Watauga at my brother in-laws car club, he brings a friend in his car and the ""friend"" ALWAYS has the windows down and ""no scrubs"" blaring on the radio and he just sticks his head out the window trying to impress girls, even though he dosen't have a license"
5,This album is the best to come out of Laface Records,"TLC's, FanMail has great rythms and beat espacially with a little touch of Rap that Lisa ""left eye"" Lopez adds to the album. This album once again shows sign of going diamond."
1,The Center of SUCK!,This movie is way over priced. I wish I had just rented it from the local movie store first. But even $2.99 may have been to much. Wish I had my $25 and 2 hrs of my time back!
2,under developed,"I just returned from watching ""Center of the World"" and must say that all I remember about the movie is the shallow dialogue and characters who never moved me to care about them. The footage, shot on digital video,left me cold most of the time as well. The story could have done so much better, considering the material. However, I refuse to feel sorry for a dot-comer who has lots of money but can't be human. How trite."
4,"Glorious sound, glacial tempi","Tempi in Bruckner's symphonies are normally on the slow side, but Celibidache's are in a class by themselves. The compensation for this lies in the quality of sound (which is gorgeous), the exquisite balances, and a combination of transparency and richness which defies explanation. Ensemble can be a bit ragged, but let us not forget that all these 'Celi' recordings come from concerts, and the man himself authorised no commercial recordings after the 1950's. A lovely recording of a profound work."
5,Great dumbell bars,"These are just great. You get two (I'm not sure the ad makes that clear). They hold weights (which you have to supply separately).As some people complain about, the knobs loosen on their own, so the weight plates wobble. But who cares? The knobs come nowhere near to spinning off or falling off.It's a small price to pay, for which you get dumbbell bars on which it is very easy to change the weights.Besides, if you want something much fancier, you wouldn't be spending 20 bucks on the internet. You'd be going to a sports store, and spending more than 100 bucks after carefully choosing something."
3,"""What a Wonderful World""","I purchased this CD for that one song. Although Rod Steward's rendition of this classicis good, no one can sing it quite like Louis Armstrong. Other selections on this disc arenot as inspiring but certainly bring back memories of the ""Armstrong era"". The sound qualityis very good. This is not a CD I will play often. However, I am glad to own it."
3,"Good, clear, good features","Product worked very well, except the connection to the lighter will disconnect randomly and cause the unit to shut off on big bumps. Really poor tip length, doesn't stick well in ANY cigarette lighter I have used!"
3,Has decent quality but it took forever for me to find a clear station!!,"It took me a few days to find a clear station but, when I did goto 89.1 it was pretty clear almost cd quality but not quite."
1,Terrible,"This product was a miserable investment. I just recently bought a new car and had to make the switch from a cassette tape adapter to an FM transmitter. I am a college student, so price was a problem, but I'm a bit of a music snob when it comes to quality, so I invested in this product that received fairly good reviews. Terrible idea. I've tried every suggestion from other reviewers and the static is unbearable. I commute to Detroit weekly and tried it out on the long drive today and it turned itself off after about 20 minutes. I reset the station again and about 5 minutes later it completely cut out again and went to pure static. It has been a frustrating weekend of giving this product the benefit of the doubt and tinkering with it a bit. Finally I'm giving in and returning it since no stations come in clear. I would highly recommend not buying this product. Keep looking."
1,Not worth the money,"It looks great and has some nice features, but the bottom line is ... it simply is not powerful enough to provide a good signal. I've used it in Fort Lauderdale where the the FM band is cluttered. Even after switching to the ""foreign"" frequency mode, and tuning to an open low frequency channel, it constantly dropped out ... very annoying. I'm taking it back and seeing if I can find the Monster transmitter which seems to have much better reviews (tough to find though at a brick & mortar)."
2,Not terribly happy.,"I honestly didn't have high hopes for this when I bought it but I was desperate for a way to listen to my mp3 player in the car. In a nutshell, the sound quality is not even close to my standards. I even switched it to international mode so that I could access the 87.9 frequency and there is still too much static. It sounds like you're listening to a radio station that is on the verge of being out of range."
1,total crap,not even worth 1$after trying all the settings possiblei get a lot of static and the best part is that the led display is all black after a couple of days of use
2,Obviously a $10 item,"Pros-Great design, very simple, straightforward, allows me to use anything I like and charge it at the same time.LED indicator is simple: Orange for charging, green for readyCheapCons-No velcro, so you're stuck trying to find a good spot to put it and hope it doesnt move so the signal doesnt dieWeak tramissionSOUNDS HORRIBLE.ANY amount of bass creates this horrific, nauseating distortion. If you plan to listen to any rap, don't. It handles highs *perfectly*, however. For exmaple: Party And Bull**** Ratatat Remix is nothing but static and horrible noise.Dorset Perception by Shpongle is crisp, clear, and beautiful until you hit 35 seconds in when a bass drum starts going, at which point nothing is bearable.Probably should've expected this from a $10 transmitter."
3,Cheap,"Works fine, but has a pretty cheap feel. The signal strength seems the same, weak. Look for a better transmitter."
2,Failed after only a few months,"This product ended up failing after only a few months, with occasional use. Not really sure why, as the cable was in perfect condition, and the product was not left in the car. The FM Module screen would stop lighting up and then stop transmitting until unplugged for a long period of time, then plugged in again."
2,didn't work for me.,"I tried this with my i-Phone with an additionale Headphone jack, also with a MP3 player.Keep hearing lots of humming sound.Didn't work at all."
2,Reeling noise when used,"The device works, however, I am less than satisfied with it. There is a screeching noise I hear in the background as I accelerate, or decelerate while driving. I heard background feedback while the song is being played. It is sometimes unbearable and I can't even listen and enjoy the song I am playing. More often than not I find myself turning my Ipod off and trying to find something worthwhile on the radio. Also, there is a port for a USB in the device but I have been unable to figure out how this will play my music media files through my car's stereo. In hindsight I shouldn't have bought a FM adapter and spent more money on a device that connects directly to the ipod and AC port."
5,Excellant,"Great Product, excellant communication and great company to do business.Offers a variety of products and will do business with again soon.Thank You!"
5,Great for Podcasts,"This FM transmitter works great - I use it to listen to Podcasts. I love the design - I can charge my phone - which is my podcast player, while listening, or I can charge any other device that uses a USB cable. I also like the slim, minimal design of the transmitter."
1,ipod transmitter,This product does work. I am able to hook my ipod up and have it play through my car speakers which is good. When you loose the currrent frequency or get static during a song its not so good. Overall I think I will eventually just get an aftermarket radio with an aux port so I can hook my ipod in directly.
1,quality of transmission is bad.,"I have just brought this FM transmitter. When the car is not moving, the quality seem to be okay. But when car is moving, it is very noisy. I regret for buying this transmitter."
2,Not for classical music,"Well, I'm very disappointed in this device. It keeps shutting off. When it works, it sounds okay, except for transmitting the noise from the car power supply in to the stereo at a low level.The problem is that their web site says it shuts offs when the volume it too low - what a bunch of morons. If I turn it up enought to keep the quiet parts from turning off, then the loud parts clip - there is no volume that will play a normal classical piece of music all the way through.When I want it off, I'll unplug it. Too clever by half."
3,Griffin iTrip Universal FM Transmitter/Charger for MP3 Player,"I received this product in a timely manner. It does the job, but sometimes I hear a humming noise in the background while playing music using this transmitter in the car. It doesn't happen all the time but when it does, it is annoying."
2,Not up to snuff,"I've used competing products, namely the Monster variant of FM transmitter, and this one is just not up to snuff. There is a loud audible whine coming from my car's acceleration that I have never heard in other transmitters. Also, even when I have it tuned to the least used station in the county, I still get static on the bass beats. Occassionally the static goes away, but rarely for more than 30 seconds which makes it all the more noticeable when it comes back. I'd rather listen to my music than listen for the static to come back all the time. Also my product shipped with a slightly damaged LCD screen (couple blank spots).I recommend the monster version, even though it doesnt have the charging capability of this model. I'll probably keep this but hack off the tuner just for the USB charger on it."
2,Mediocre at best,"I bought one of these about two years ago for my job, which was transportation, and our company vehicle didn't have a cd player. Here are the two biggest problems with this product:1. The sound came out mono, so it was like only listening to half of the band play.2. The device would shut off every five to ten minutes if the mp3 player was charging simultaneously.Overall, not totally crappy, but there are many many better options out there."
1,The worst ever!,"The signal strength is SO BAD, you can barely hear anything. Complete waste of money. My old Belking transmitter works so much better... pity the charging function does not work with my new ipod touch."
1,"Second time, NOT a Charm.","This is the second iTrip I have bought. The first, bought three years ago, works much better and I paid about $30 for it. They appear to be the exact same unit, but the transmitter audio quality on this second one is very poor. I just happened to find one on Amazon for less than $3 so I figured I couldn't loose and wanted to have a backup unit. WRONG! Griffin products are usually top quality, but this one is junk. Sad."
1,Worthless,I tried every frequency possible and even the international freq's that aren't used in the U.S. and I still couldn't get a static free signal. I tried this in multiple cars as well with no luck. I would not recommend this to anyone. I had another cheap off name FM transmitter that worked 10x better then this garbage (until it broke).
1,Cheap for a reason,This worked great for one 4 hour drive. Tried to use it a month later and it is dead dead dead.
2,It works.... sometimes,"It works well, when its on. I had really high hopes for this thing since it goes down below 88.1 but not quite. Sound quality it great but it has something built in to where if it doesn't ""hear"" sound for a set period of time it turns itself off. Dumbest idea ever. It works fine for music but podcasts on my iPod nano are a whole different ballgame."
1,Griffin iTrip FM transmitter,"This product has horrible reception. It may just be in South Florida, but I'm currently looking for a replacement because listening to music from my MP3 player using this product is painful."
1,Don't waste your time,"Purchased this item as many people had given it a favorable review, and was extremely disappointed with item. It has a LOUD buzz sound when your car is at a stand still at a light or when in a park position. I tried literally every station it supported to no avail. When driving the buzzing seems to go away a bit, but still very annoying.I also tried adding aluminum foil tape around the cable to cut down on RF noise with no help to the signal.Luckily this unit is cheap and did lose much money on this purchase. But recommend you staying away from this unit."
4,Almost everything I wanted.,"I needed a transmitter for my new shuffle, and wanted something that had the ability to charge it. Unfortunately this can't charge and play at the same time, but I don't think any can b/c the shuffle charges via the headphone jack. I love the fact that you can set it to the international mode, the radio in my van gets the lower channels that most don't (87.5-88.1) so i get no interference. My biggest complaint though is that I have to turn the volume on the shuffle so high that it gets distorted on louder songs, but if I don't the transmitter turns off on softer songs. Aside from that it's the best transmitter I've owned so far."
1,No Good for Podcasts!,"I bought this so I could listen to podcasts in my car. Unfortunately even with the sound at the highest volume, this iTrip would decide there was no signal and turn itself off. It worked fine for music, but with podcasts I had to turn it back on about every 30 seconds. I returned it. To bad because the sound was pretty good and it worked well other than the power off ""feature."""
4,doesn't charge my 2nd generation shuffle,"I mainly got this becasue cars have stopped putting Cassette decks in cars and since I was in the market for a new car, I needed something for my shuffle. It works fine for the price I paid. There is some static, so you have to keep the transmitter elevated. My main complaint is that it does not charge my shuffle, but since my pod is charged using a plug and not a USB, that may be why."
1,Poor choice,I bought two of these and they are both defective. After about 1 to 2 minutes of use the unit appears to go to sleep and stops transmitting to the radio. If I change the setting on the unit it starts operating again.
3,OK,"This FM transmitter does the 87.9 frequency, so that's nice. It charges an mp3 player with an internal battery, also nice. The sound quality is poor, so I would only buy this transmitter if this is not important to you. On a side note, when used in international mode to access the 87.9 frequency, the transmitter doesn't default to a preset when powered on. This doesn't get in the way of the functionality, just a little annoying to need to press the preset button every time you turn your mp3 player on."
3,Does the job.,"Sound quality is a bit less than a radio station, much less than cd quality. Setting it to INTL so that you can get to the lower frequencies is a must, or static will be an issue. For pod casts, does the trick, but music leaves a bit to be desired, I have had 8 track tapes sound better. Also, it will shut down if the volume for the song is not high enough because it thinks the mp3 player is turned off. I am using it with a sansa clipSanDisk Sansa Clip+ 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)and to avoid continuous shut offs I leave it plugged into the charger at all times while using the iTrip."
1,turns off constantly,"I like this product fine -- when it works. However, no matter what I do, it turns off after a minute of use. The instructions say that it's designed to shut off ""after 50 seconds of silence"", in order to save power. Apparently, its idea of silence is VERY skewed, because the only way I can get it to stay awake is to turn it up so loudly that the audio distorts (it's peaking/overloading). It's unusable, so I'm going to return it and go with a different brand.Iphone 3GS users beware: I got almost no GPS reception when this product was plugged into my phone's audio port."
2,"""new""? thats up for debate...","i bought this item, listed as ""new"" from ""shopcell"". what arrived in the mail could hardly be described that way. i received an fm transmitter that was not in any sort of manufacturers packaging (unless thats how you describe a ziplock baggie) and came with ""instructions"" that appeared to have been xeroxed multiple times over. i have no way of telling if this item is actually new, refurbished or just used. there doesnt appear to be any cosmetic damage, and have yet to see if it even works properly. price aside, this was a most frustrating purchase. i guess you do get what you pay for. i use amazon less than some other online retailers but really thought they did a good job of managing their sellers. maybe i was mistaken."
2,Griffin iTrip universal FM transmitter & charger,Very well designed product but functionality is not up to the mark. Transmitter turns off too quickly when audio level within a song gets low even if the volume level on MP3 player is set to full volume. FM transmitter is weak. Transmitting on regular frequencies is not worth trying (unless there are few stations in your area); turning on the international mode helps use the 87.7 frequency. I would not recommend this product.
4,Decent product for the price,"Overall I am happy with the product. I use 87.9 and it seems to come in pretty clear most of the time. If the song I am listening to is not strong enough, the unit tends to shut off automatically."
4,Righly priced,The iTrip universal is not as good as its $50+ cousin but at 90% performance of the top priced unit is impossible to beat. Just find a quiet station and you will be enjoying lots of mp3 music. The 10% difference is due to inner city interference but if you live and work in the suburbs you will not notice the difference.
2,RECEIVED USED PRODUCT BUT RECEIVED REFUND,"DISSAPOINTED WITH THE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT OF A NEW ITEM YET RECEIVED A USED, SCRATCHED AND PARTIALLY FUNCTIONING ITEM. ONLY GOOD THING WAS THAT I GOT MY MONEY BACK"
5,Excellent product,"Easy to set up and to use. Worked very well on a cross country trip as well as at home in the District of Columbia. It kept my iPhone (old version, not 3G) charged and the music playing. Just remember to keep the volume on your iPhone down (around 50%) and adjust the volume to your liking on the car's radio."
2,not for me,"I won't dog it completely, but I will say that even out in the middle of the desert I still get static. So with that said would anyone like to buy one from me. haha. If I had to do it over again I wouldn't buy it, so I hope that helps you."
2,"Could be great, if it worked","The iTrip Auto Universal+ could be a great product, if it actually worked. The auto-off feature works so well that unless you have your MP3 player cranked and are listening to loud music it shuts off after a minute. It also has fairly weak output compared to similar products. The good features are it can broadcast on any station, has presets to remember the best frequencies to broadcast, and it can charge your MP3 or other devices through its built in USB power connector. Now, if only I could find a product with these features that actually worked."
4,Customer Review,Overall I like this product. I use it with my Sony mp3 player and I don't have any compatibility issues. Since I use it on road trips I sometimes have to click twice to get a signal where my music comes through clearly.
2,Signal not strong enough,"It's OK, and works, but the you may have to change the frequency a lot, and not easy to find a fixed frequency that works. It's probably signal strength problem. I leave in California and I couldn't find a frequency to get clear sound, but with another cheaper FM transmitter everything is working."
3,"OK transmitter quality, charger is great","FM Transmitter:It works alright but does require a perfectly clear signal to work. It sends some feedback from the charger which can be slightly aggravating, especially on higher volume settings. The stored channels list is completely unintuitive. It requires you to first flip to the stored channel you want to alter and then adjust that specific channel. This is very time intensive. The length of the cord is good and allows relatively good distance for most cars but the cords seem a little frail.Charger:The usb port on the charger is incredibly useful. You can plug any standard usb charge cable into it. There are many devices that do this independently but the added benefit is that 1.) it is already part of another accessory you have 2.) doesn't take up an extra power slot."
1,Better sound quality playing through device with no headphones then speakers!,Absolutely disappointing. Purchased this to replace my monster icarplay wireless that I used for years since the cords were fraying and the sound quality on this was horrible. Better sound came out of my ipod playing it through the device without headphones on then the muffled static that was emitting on every station I tried. I live near a metro area but still in the suburbs. Going to purchase another monster product instead. Save your money!
2,IS THERE A BETTER WAY?,"I own one of these things. I live in Chicago, the big city. I cannot get crystal clear sound quality, using this thing. The ""magic"" wavelength that everyone talks about, is not on my FM band, nor is it on the iTRIP. There were no instructions. I think that if I lived out in the rural south somewhere, this thing would probably work perfectly. This is the ONLY reason, that I did not give it just one star. WHY ISN'T THERE A CONTRAPTION WHERE YOU CAN PLAY YOUR MP3 MUSIC THROUGH THE CD PLAYER, INSTEAD OF BEING AT THE MERCY OF FM RECEPTION? The performance of this transmitter has been very disappointing."
2,Good idea- if only it worked...,"I intended to use this product for my cat on our 7 hour road trip, so he could have the whole back seat to himself without distracting me up front. It worked for about 3 hours, and then he figured out how to get around it... I can't imagine how this would ever work for a dog. The net is very easy to pull down, even when tightened.As you can see on the picture provided, there are gaps on the sides of, and above the seats that the cat can sneak through.Aside from that, the clips that came with it are pretty much impossible to use- i had to use safety pins. Not a big deal, but annoying.Anyway- it was a good idea, and inexpensive, it just didn't work."
1,Motorola T5920 Radios,my work ordered 2 pair of these radios and they are the WORST possible radio you could buy.. the longest range we get is about 200 feet or so. 2 of the 4 we got were bad and had to be sent back. Highly DO NOT reccomend!
1,Company did not send the Iteam ordered,"I ordered 6 adjustable universal cigarette lighter splitters. I got six splitters but the are the hard plastic non adjustable kind, not at all like the ones shown. The shipping cost was almost as much as the splitters so I am not going to pay to send them back. I never got an e-mail about the substituation or response to my calls or e-mail to the company. I will not buy any thing else from them."
2,Third try isn't a charm,"If you're a fan of this series, do yourself a favor and re-read Life Its Own Self. I started Rude Behavior for the third time and ground my way through because I was DETERMINED to see what had happened to Billy Clyde 'n them. Now I want back the hours of my life I spent reading it.It's at least 100 pages too long. The idea for the plot is good, (Big Ed and Billy Clyde buy and manage an NFL expansion team) but between the wooden dialogue, the two-dimensional characters, the anti-PC fulminations that even I tired of, and the lines recycled from other novels, the finished product is awful.The only thing that saves this review from getting one star are the occasional original Jenkins-ism, like what he has Jim Tom Pinch say to the Golden Domer out in Hollywood."
2,disappointment,"Having read Dan Jenkins' other works, I began this one with considerable eagerness. But it was soon obvious that the author was pushing too hard to be funny. In his other works the humor seemed to flow effortlessly--especially in ""Semi Tough"" and ""Baja Oklahoma"" and ""Dead Solid Perfect."" This isn't to say that the current work isn't without its moments. It's merely that it isn't up to Jenkins' own high standards. That's the sad part of a book that is supposed to be funny. Ya gotta play hurt, Dan. Ya gotta take chances to be funny. The only thing in the middle of the road is a yellow stripe and dead armadillos, as a Texas politician said."
3,Not Ideal For Dog That Likes to Destroy Toys,I bought this for my American Eskimo. He managed to pull out all the stuffing and the squeaker within 30 minutes. I gave it 3 stars because even without the stuffing my Eskie loves to play with this toy.
4,Cute toy,"This toy is cute but leaves blue fuzz on the carpet. After 3 weeks, it is still leaving its mark all over the house. I will not buy this brand of toy again.UPDATE: After 5 months this toy is still intact and my 6 lb dog loves it. The fuzz stopped shedding right after I wrote the first review. A disappointment has become a favorite."
2,Desiderata,"I agree with the reviewers who say that this is not the voice recording that we remember from the early 70s. The voice that I remember was lower and more soothing than what I heard on this recording. The back ground music seems more distracting than I remember as well. Since I was looking forward to the old sound, I was disappointed,"
4,Get into C# quickly.,"If you are interested in programming in C#, just curious or want a reference text then this is a very good book. Being at around 185 pages this book gets right to the point, so it is for programmers familiar with languages like Java, C/C++ or those that are experienced. It contains a language reference and introduction into the .NET framework and class library. It does not cover using Visual Studio .NET and RAD application development. Topics pertaining to the .NET framework are restricted to a few areas, with a few small examples, with pointers given to where to look in the framework SDK online help. If you want to pursue your interest in C# then you can get a more thorough book to follow C# Essentials, but this is still useful as a small quick reference to the language."
5,One of the Best Jazz CD's I've heard!,This CD is one of the best that I have heard in a long while. The tunes are both stimulating and relaxing at the same time. It is the perfect collection of tunes for a romantic dinner at home!
5,"A beautiful, deceptively simple, love story","Hyssop is a beautiful story told in under 200 pages, so simple it is deceptive, a love story between friends, between lovers, between couples, possibly even between the Catholic Church and her adherents, between everything and nothing. It's a novel of magical realism grounded not in South America but it in the southwestern U.S. and that Kevin McIlvoy manages to question and extol faith and Mexican/American culture in almost one seamless breath through the relationships and stories of Red Greet, the protagonist, is another kind of magic. Such an imaginative and poetic novel--I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys novels with plots that play and meander. It made me laugh out loud with joy!"
2,Did not expect melt-away type,"I would not have ordered if better description was given. however my grand kids love, so it's ok I hope to see hard candies available"
4,Timing light,"Only used it once to test it and it worked well, very bright a little clumsy to use but for the few times that I will use it it is a great product. It was excellent value for money I have seen many that don't appear to be the same quality but are twice the price. Cheers DavidY"
3,Did the Job,"I borrowed a timing light from my neighbor and then promptly killed it. New ones are quite a change from the one I killed and those I remember. Nonetheless, this one served well to get my job done and replace the one that had become deceased."
2,"cheap,could be better. Poor inductive pickup design","Cheap feeling plastic, dont know how it would survive if dropped on a shop concrete floor. Light is bright enough when working properly.Here is the main complaint on this item, the inductive pickup. If you have smaller diameter wires say 6,7 or 8 mm, you will have issues with the inductive pickup not sensing the spark. I have brand new wires(7 mm), brand new cap and rotor, and brand new spark plugs. Tried sliding it in different spots on the wire, same issue random light flash's. Borrowed my buddies timing light made by another company, and it worked like a charm . The inductive pickup is large I assume to accomdate large diameter wires, but with standard size wires there is too much space for it to proper pick up the signal. Tried all kinds of varations of wire placement, etc and same result, random flash's making it not useable.Sending this back, disappointed as the super el cheapo one I had from harbor freight tools worked better then this one."
1,Do not buy,"I bought this gun and used it four times. The next time I went to use it, it didn't work. I called the manufacturer, and they said sorry, but there is nothing we can do. The gun was just over 1 yr old. No warranty"
4,Two innocents caught in the middle of a drug deal.,"When Alexandara and Matt Spencer fulfill their dream and make the final payment on their own Yacht, they can now start a new chapter of their life. Previously Matt had survived as a POW in Vietnam and Alex wondered how deep the mental scars were buried. But, neither of them could foresee that their new life would include death and terror for both of them.An intriguing story that rapidly jumps from character to character as the danger to each is increased - whether they realize it or not. This one seemed to become a 'short' story as I read it, because I didn't want to put the book down. . . ."
2,poor sound quality,"They look terrific, but sound lousy. Very tinny, very little bass. For about 10 dollars more you can get Koss 'phones at Radio Shack. They don't look as cool, but they sound much better."
3,hps,"product has good sound and fit, cord could be more pliable or better quality,. no faults otherwise"
1,Not recommended.,"I have always been a loyal Sennheiser fan. Having owned several headphones from them, I expected the continuation of high quality sound without having to spend thousands of dollars. However, the PMX-60 does not fit the bill. The Bass is very weak even when amped. Treble is too high and I find myself constantly adjusting EQ settings to make it sound ""right"". (Anyone knows a good headphone does not require any adjustments). The neckband can be uncomfortable due to hard plastics without any insulating material.Overall, I find the sound quality to be poor and not up to standard. Even though these headphones weren't expensive, I wouldn't recommend it. Spend a bit more and get the PX-100s, you won't be disappointed."
4,Well not bad at all,"I have no complaints .... these things sound great, and they are comfortable to wear as well. If you are looking for this type of headphone you cant go wrong ..the are loud, clear, and crisp sounding, in fact to be honest way better than I had hoped!"
4,Sounds great and lasts a few years,"I bought these about 2-3 years ago and they're been great. A really high quality sounding set of headphones, especially for their size! Also, fairly comfortable to wear.I bought these specifically to wear when I'm working out at the gym. I noticed pretty quickly that the fabric around the earpieces had torn on the bottom (probably do to sweat + the movement of running), but no real big deal.Just the other day the right earpiece stopped working. No visible damage to a wire, it only produces sound on the left side now. Oh well, they're fairly cheap, sound great, and lasted me a few years. I just bought my 2nd pair of these today. I figure if I can get 2-3 years of use out of these, it's a good buy."
4,Good headphones for the price,"Not a bad set of headphones. They get a little hard on my sensitive ears after hours of use, but overall, I am very happy with the purchase. They are light enough so that I can hear the important things around me, versus the large, cushy headphones that would be nice to wear, but not practical for my own personal use."
1,Enjoyed until they broke,"These headphones were pretty good for almost everyday use for about 8 months. After putting them on one morning, after no previous damage done to them, only a small amount of sound would come out of them. I would have to move around plug side of the cord and hold it in a specific spot to have the sound work properly (which makes them useless)."
2,Do you like tin?,"Then you'll love these headphones. I'm coming off a set of Sony cordless mdr-if230 headphones. The Sony blow these away. The sound is not isolated enough. If you squeeze the headphones against your head, you get better sound. They are very tinny. Also, everyone who sits within 70' of me can here what I'm listening to. Cord is too short. They're probably good for jogging or working out, but if you like good sound, look somewhere else."
3,good sound on a short cord,"I've been through many headphones. This is definately the best style and these rank in the top 10% for sound quality. But if you are 6' or taller and want this for the gym, you'll wish you had an extra foot of cord."
3,Clutch Master Cylinder,"Clutch Master Cylinder was used as a replacement in my Toyota Solara. The hydraulics were replaced with the clutch. We ran into issues with this master cylinder. Fluid bled past the diaphragm. I had to get another locally. I have used Beck Arnley products exclusively on all Japanese cars for years. I do not think less of Beck products. I feel I just got a bad one off the shelf. Amazon took care of the transaction and promptly issued a refund. I give a 3 star just because dealing with Amazon makes the tranaction ""hassle free"""
5,Love Songs,"This is the most recent Michael Ball CD I have and I have been playing it constantly. I had wanted to hear the Brel song, IF YOU GO AWAY. On this CD it is sung in both English and French - very soft and very romantic. ALL BY MYSELF and WALK AWAY are very much the dramatic voice and very passionate. The best part of a Michael Ball song is that he makes each song a performance and really sings the words. The voice gives even familiar songs a different nuance to make them his songs. The songs that were new to me sound as if no other voice could ever sing them. This is the CD for the moods of love."
4,Good collection,"My wife and I enjoy John Denver, and we think this is a very good cross-section of his work.As prolific as he was, and as many periods and styles as he has had would make a truly complete collection rather difficult, but this is pretty nice. It is a bit more directed to his earlier days and mountain/outdoor themes, but it is quite enjoyable!"
4,"ROCKY MOUNTAIN NOT QUITE HIGH ENOUGH ,WITHOUT BOBBIE","GREAT COLLECTION WITH EXCEPTION OF THE OMISSION OF THE SONG""FOR BOBBIE"". I LOVE THIS SONG AND ITS A SAD SONG TO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT. (PUN INTENDED)"
4,nostalgic roadside memories,"Comapres to substance of the Rt-66 books. Especiall the legacy of attractions bypassed by time. Some like Ligonier Pool have been salvaged, & will reopen..but most drive-ins are gone"
3,Great help,"I saw a documentary about the Lincoln highway and since we were going to PA I thought it would be great driving down a piece of history. Great reading but the highway is hard to fine in most places. If you have extra time on your trip I would recommend trying it. It is easy to find in Gettysburg, PA ... there are signs everywhere. Take you time and enjoy!"
4,A venture to Xmas past,Great old Xmas cartoons I enjoyed when I was a kid and now my kids are enjoying the same images of Xmas Cartoons from my childhood.
3,again UTFO the truth,"this one was ok ,i guess im just a fan they had a diffrenet sound at the time somthing new i liked them from oh10"
1,Poor,"I bought this book a few months ago with one of my friends. We decided to try to make a new muffin every Sunday when we got a chance. So far we have made about 20 different types of muffins and every single one has tasted exactly the same, bland and boring. I have followed the recipe to exactly what it says and all of these muffins have absolutely no flavor and I have had to throw them out in pure disgust. I looked up online to [...] and [...] and both these websites have completely different recipes than this book. I'm sorry, but I do not recommend this book to anyone if they want to enjoy a good tasting muffin."
5,FINALLY! The answer is revealed,"Finally, this book explains WHY that most elusive of mighty creatures,whos very existence remains steadfastly unsubstantiated, has maintained his intentional solitude despite Western man's indefatigable attempts at detection:He's a friggin' alien, that just happens to kinda look like an ape (but definitely SMELLS of one!),has three toes and rides around in a space ship. That, or if he's from Washington, he's an evolved (devolved?) ""Early Man"" that has adapted into a hairy,smelly,four toed & very tall ""ape"" man. And he still hates dogs.On top of all that, even if you ever DO see him you'll never remember it, as he has mastered the skill of hypnosis and mind control and will have your memory completely erased (though apparently not the skill of hygiene). I kid you not!How I truly miss the 1970's..."
3,Weaker rehahsh of a classic 70s movie ..............................,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A SPOILER (BY RELATIVE ASSOCIATION) .....................................................................................................This movie is best described as a much weaker rehash of Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter set in modern times.In the first 15 minutes you have figured out the whole story, the identity of the Traveler is telegraphed much too early which kills any mystery, tension or suspense ....... So unfortunately you must then sit thru the next 85 minutes waiting to see the inevitable scenes you know are coming and the ending that you already figured out in that same first 15 minutes."
2,It kind of depends what you're looking for,"This pop chart topper is not original (see above reviews), not very musical, and not even really that danceable (unless you're good at dancing with a vertical pole in your underwear). It is, however, very sexy. This is one of those singles that sells because it aired a lot for a brief time, and it has a very seductive video. I'd suggest that you see the video, if it turns you on, you'll find yourself buying the CD single. If you don't ever see the video, I'm thinking you're not going to be impressed by hearing the song. These are, by the way, the same Pussycat Dolls who do a pretty good cover of ""Sway"" in the otherwise forgettable remake (J-Lo) of ""Shall We Dance,"" and again, it has a pretty sexy music video too."
1,BLEEEECH,Pop tarts making horrible re-makes. This really does suck and is so manufactured I can taste the plastic when they sing.
1,vanilla sex,this version is crap- don't waste your money- it's like sex without an orgasm...what's the point? search out the original by tori alamaze- it's definitely worth it.
3,Whats going on?,"Ok, i heard the Tori Alamaze version long before the Pussycat dolls, but i didnt catch her name. So when i heard the version with Busta Rhymes, i thought wow this song is getting radio play now. But upon listening to the two versions, I was stumped as to why one version was more soulful than the other. That's when i found out about the pussycat dolls. So now i know that there are actually two versions of the song sung by different people, which is actually quite strange to me. Its amazing how the lead singer of the pussycat dolls imitated (thats right, i said imitated) Tori's every note. I know there's a lead singer in this group, but i'm not sure what the rest of the 182 chicks in group do. Maybe they're just props. Anyway, no matter what went down behind the scenes, this is still a good song. I just hate that the original singer has been pushed into the background."
4,stop dogging on pop music.,"A lot of songs out there don't make since but are very catchy whether its rock, rap, or R&B. By the way, R&B is the same as pop music. The only difference is R&B has more urban feel to it. So why r u guys harping on pop music all the time. Look at Gwen Stefani's Hollaback Girl and Missy Elliot's Lose Control. They don't make sense at all. But everyone is always dogging on pop music. At least pop music is real music. Rap music is not real music at all. U know what they say, Those who can't sing rap. I hate how rappers always dog on pop music as crappy music. I wouldn't talk. Rap music is crap music with a lot of negative subject matter. If u don't like this version there's the Ralph Rosario club mixes which is 10 times better than the album version by the Pussycat Dolls."
1,All You Need Is Booty!!,"Oh, shake that wild thing, mama!! Stick out your booty in my face and grab yourself in lustful places!! Dig those high heels in my back and flip that hair all around. JUST DON'T TRY TO TELL ME YOU'RE A SINGER OR AN ARTIST!!! When will MUSIC make a comeback? I'm so sick and tired of the moguls of Hip-Hop PUSHING PUSHING PUSHING their manufactured and totally talentless video vixens in my face and calling it MUSIC! This ain't music, this is pornography without even the satisfaction of live action. These girls WILL NEVER TOUR and they WILL NEVER PAY THEIR DUES through years of hard work and inspiration. TOTAL PLASTIC B.S.!!!!"
1,LET's GET THIS STRAIGHT...,I just wanna say straight up that this version copied from Tori Alamaze is way NOT better...Don't get me wrong Pussycat Dolls did copy her lyrics and style quite all right yet Busta Rhymes killed it totally...WAY...Anyways the O.G. Original style TORI ALAMAZE does a way better job and honestly I give TORI ALAMAZE MAD props for making this song of Don't Cha...I just can't believe people are already trying to make this song their's when it ain't and when they don't even got it better...Awesome song and recommend TORI ALAMAZE's version a whole lot better...AND THATS ON THE REAL!!!Junior MoralesP.S. Like I said don't be confused with the real voice that did this song justice...TORI ALAMAZE...Plus Tori Alamaze's version has been hitting in the clubs first ever since late November and honestly people that is why it became a BIG HIT BECUASE OF TORI ALAMAZE (WHO AS A FACT IF U LIVE IN THE SOURTHERN CALI AREA U HEARD FIRST FROM TORI ALAMAZE)...
3,"The single is great,but.....","What I'm wondering is what do the other five girls do. I mean, there is the lead singer, who is good, but then the instruments sound a little too commercial for the five girls in the band to be playing. I like bands who write their own songs and play their own instruments. And I know just because a band does both those things, doesn't mean they're good. Well, that is all I have to say."
4,Excellent,The product I recieved was in good conditon and it came in a reasonable amount of time considering the holidays. I would most defintely order something again.
2,"All hat, no cattle","I am disappointed that such important stories are told in such an off-hand way, as if the teller does not quite believe what he is telling. While interesting intellectually, they cannot be read to children as written but must be extensively rephrased to achieve that natural, intimate feel that a story must have to be credible. Idries Shah seems to have been poorly served by his editors this time around."
2,Bummer,"It was way too dark, as in lighting. It was also way too femme fatale for my tastes and very predictable."
5,The cover says it all,"This one is ghastly indeed.As one reviewer states{Have you ever heard of adoption lady?)This is something a normal person would do,right?There is the issue of the ladies revenge,giving them the reason to make this twisted sick masterpiece of horror. The emotions run high.The acting was really great. Made me want to look away in the one scene(You know the one)but still,I just had to take it in.If you want horror that disturbs and entertains.Then Inside surely will deliver. DVD has both orginal french language and english audio dubbed feature along with english subtitles."
3,strange and dark,while i love horror this movie was filmed useing very little light which made it very hard to know what the hey was going on with that said there are no happy enddings in this film so if you like horror where someone walks away stay away
3,Even though it's not complete I still love it.,RCA was ignorant to leave out songs contained on the original album. But with a cassette of the album and a CD burner that problem can be partially taken care of
4,Good place to start.,Found this good place to start since my new job consisted primarily of LINUX servers (DHCP/DNS/MAIL). Picked up some good tips and tricks off this book. I wished that they would have concentrated more on Red Hat. Not a bad buy.
4,Just what I was looking for,This book has it all! Being a Windows 2000 administrator this book knows where I'm coming from. Explains the information very good. The only problem is the book isn't laid out as nice as I would like it to be so I have to do a little more hunting for things than I would like to. Overall an Excellent book!
2,"Settles some issues, brings up more","I agree that this is a book that has been needed for a while, but is incomplete and somewhat misleading.For one thing he completely glosses over both the free and commercial versions of the ASP engines (Apache::ASP, mod_perl, ChiliSoft), and spends little time in explaining something as essential to the Open Source and Linux movements as _make_. Also, he completely misses the point of Linux throughout the book, attributing Linux's success to free as in beer, vice free as in speech and the licensing and fair use issues.The major contribution this book makes is as a bridge to the Windows script kiddies. Linux and Unix admins beware! More of them will know where to go in your file systems now!Marginally fair to good as an intro, but dangerous."
1,"unfortunately Very Fat book ,but Not For Beginners","I bought this book , and i wait it about 1 month for arrive to me , but i am not lucky , the book contains more than 1300 pages , but i didn't find any thing benefit for me .I advise any one in beginner Level to keep away from this book .you must save your money ."
1,"Good for IE, not for NS","Im a semi-professional DHTML developer, and i have tons of books from Microsoft on IE, i dont need another one, i want NS, lots of it, and while it has some, its mostly IE. Thats what makes this book stupid. How can it include DOM stuff, when its always changing. Way below O'Reillys standard. Hope they learn"
2,"as it says, its just a reference",i was rather disappointed with this book. i learned dhtml better from the tutorials you can find online than in the 150 pages it devoted to applying dhtml. if you're looking for a reference book only then i guess this is probably the best choice out there (probably the only choice) but if you're looking to learn dhtml like i was then either wait for a new book or learn from the tutorials online that have real examples you can actually see.
3,Keep this on your desk,"Although a little dry, it *is* a reference you know. And as far as references go, this is a good, dependable one. This is one of those books that I keep going back to, whenever I need help with my DHTML and even CSS. It offers a clear and concise explanation of the DOM, and everything you need to manipulate it."
1,Out of date and overpriced.,"The reason this book ranks so high is that it's a thick, expensive, convoluted cookbook of singular examples without any real coverage of the subject matter.In other words, its a marketing dept's dream!This book hasn't been updated since 1998, and hasn't kept pace with technology...., the last chapter on DHTML is entitled ""Looking Ahead to HTML 4.0"" We're beyond HTML 4.0 and on to XHTML, XML, etc.!The fact that this chapter ends on page 163 should tell you something. The Book is 1073 page long! The remaining 910 are poor references for HTML 3.2, Javascript 1, and CSS 1. All of which are out of date. And where is the analysis of the Document Object Model? Oh, I forgot, it gets 2 pages! The DOM IS WHAT MAKES DHTML POSSIBLE..."
5,"excellent reference of HTML, CSS, Javascript and DOM","Although things change quickly on the Internet, this book is still the best reference and resource on web site building that I have come across. The book contains a complete reference divided in sections on HTML, the Document Object (DOM), Style Sheet Attributes and the JavaScript Language. All attribute entries include a description and example. The versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape that support it are mentioned with it. The extensive DOM reference also includes the properties and methods.The appendixes describe HTML character entities, color names and RGB values, keyboard event character values and specific Internet Explorer commands.The book starts with a section describing all these features of Dynamic HTML in general and how to apply them. For example, absolute versus relative positioning is explained in detail, followed by an explanation of positioning attributes.The book is my inseparable companion when I'm working on my web site."
4,A fun first step to learning Italian!,"I found the CD songs fun and they really stuck in my head. I did use the book to follow along at first - and loved that it was word for word with the CD. I agree that at that time I had to concentrate too hard to be driving and learning - but once I learned the basics and didn't need the book, just listening to the music CD was enjoyable - and ""do-able"" while driving."
5,"""The Simpsons"" is much more informative!","I find network ""news"" mostly vapid and manipulative, and rarely watch it, so it was actually a shock to see this very persuasive documentary on just how scripted and biased Fox ""news"" is. The film employs myriad examples of internal memoranda and Fox news footage to illustrate how its reporters, anchors, and commentators operate in lock step to present a uniformly ""on message"" right-wing agenda. Perhaps the most interesting of many statistics cited is that Fox news viewers are among the most confused and poorly informed on foreign policy, and (what a coincidence) most likely to support the Bush administration. And Fox's use of scare tactics and ""wedge"" issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion is predictably cynical. It truly would be laughable if it weren't all so fundamentally antithetical to a functioning democracy."
1,Lousy.,"This was a poorly done documentary. Liberals were never upset with biased journalism when the only people who ran journalism were NBC, ABC, and CBS. However, now that there is a popular alternative to the liberal media, people have shown artificial anger at Fox News. Fox News is popular for a reason -- it shows a point of view that most Americans agree with. It may be biased, but so are most of the other channels. If one wants to diversify the number of sources from which they receive news and information, that would be a smart and wise choice. However, to say that the fairness doctrine must be imposed upon Fox News would emasculate the purpose of the program. Yes, Fox News will continue to upset the liberals, but we live in a free country with lots of choices."
4,"Not new news, but interesting","I think it's pretty obvious that FOX is a thinly-veiled shill for right wing political views, but I suppose there are people out there who are fooled and think it's actually a legitimate news source. This film was interesting as it really shows all the subtle little tricks FOX uses as well as some of the blatent ones and behind the scenes agenda-setting from higher-up. If youare already on to FOX's rubbish, you won't be shocked -- but ...? I must admit it is interesting to see how their tactics affect other news sources."
4,Well researched documentary!,"Outfoxed isn't aesthetically pleasing as far as cinematography or visual effects. My guess is the budget went to research and fact checking. What the film lacks in imagery, it makes up for in credible interviewees and the profound sound bites they provide.One main theme I took from the film is the concept that Fox News claims to be the leader in fair & balanced journalism, when it is proven time and again to be incredibly unfair and remarkably unbalanced; so much so that one can hardly call it journalism. Unfortunately, Fox's technique proves to be good for ratings, causing other networks to loosely follow Fox's lead in the industry, thereby ""outfoxing"" other networks and incidentally, their viewers.It's not as fun to watch as a Michael Moore piece, but it's much less slanted and much more serious; therefore (in my opinion) more credible. It is a MUST SEE for those dedicated to Fox News. Challenge yourself."
1,Nice try,This documenary is nothing but garbage. It is another attack on Fox News from the liberal left. Come on people! all news agencies are biased! I hardly ever watch Fox News. But I do agree with almost everything that Bill O'Reilly says. One of the things I agree with him is one thing. Liberals are out of control. Any leftist who doesn't find this review helpful has definitely out of his mind.
5,Eye Opening,"This movie opened my eyes to just how much Fox tries to mislead viewers in their news broadcasts, instead of just telling people the information and allowing them to develop their own opinion. It proves just how evil and close minded Bill O'Reilly really is. I still can't understand how people can watch his show. I guess I just don't want to believe that there are that many evil, mean spirited people in the world."
3,Twisting of the truth,"Unfortunately, if you think Fox News is great and regularly watch The Factor, you probably won't believe this movie. If you already think Fox is nonsense, this movie certainly won't convince you otherwise, though it may at times entertain you. In particular, I highly recommend viewing Glick's interview with O'Reilly.The presentation of the movie was a bit awkward, in my opinion, and not being divided into chapters doesn't help if you want to review a section.Certainly, though, if you're interested in becoming informed about one of America's most influential and most biased news networks, this film is a must-see. I think any information presented must be taken with a grain of salt, as the filmmakers are certainly trying to persuade the viewer, but the amount of fact, footage, and analysis of Fox News is both impressive and damning."
5,Get un-Hannitized.,"A much-needed jab at the right, Robert Greenwald's OUTFOXED exposes the ""fair and balanced"" slogan for the misrepresentation it is. With a clever barrage of hijacked clips from FOX NEWS, including the indefatigable Bill O'Reilly, the documentary effectively illustrates the network as nothing more than a mouthpiece for the neocons in the administration about to pass into history. Insightful and inciteful, and highly recommended. Spin this."
5,Exposing the Commissars at Fox News,"It is everything you expect and more.There is the usual: Rupert Murdoch's background, his trashy publications in other countries, his conservative politics and cozy deals from the FCC. We hear Bill O'Reilly lie--again--this time claiming he has only told one person to ""shut up!"" The film provides clip after clip of O'Reilly screaming ""shut up,"" examples even this infrequent viewer of his program knew existed in abundance. Of course, the film reminds us of Fox News' utter idolatry of George Bush.The shocking revelation in the film is the disclosure of the memoranda that descends from Fox's hierarchy to its news anchors informing them of news spins for the day, demonstrating that the commissars at Fox News engage in a level of explicit media control arguably comparable to the darkest days of the USSR under Stalin."
4,Is Fox slanted?,"Its almost a funny thing to debate whether Fox is an actual news network. What is it that makes the devil so good at his job? He mixes truth with his lies. Of course Fox News isn't evil, but they are trying mighty hard.This film was a good documentary that succeeds in spite of itself. Luckily for the film makers the truth basically tells the story and the slow mish-mash of mediocre editing takes little from the intent.Good but not great. Preaching to the choir."
1,unable to focus in low light,"As the owner of a bigger, more complicated digital camera for ""serious"" photography, I purchased this camera to bring along with me in my pocket to parties, happy hours, etc. BIG MISTAKE. This camera will not focus AT ALL in low light. I sent it back for exchange, thinking I had a lemon, and received a replacement that was just as bad. I called the manufacturer to complain, and was told ""a camera at this price has limitations."" Like being unable to focus?!?! I would expect this from a cheesey, no-name brand, but not from Konica Minolta (who now, in my opinion, rank with the cheesey no-name brands)."
5,Must have!!,"Every music collection should include this CD. There are few things that I look foward too as much as a sunday morning, drinking coffee, with this cd playing. It doesn't get much better than that."
2,A Disappointment,"The one word I would use to define this album is ""lugubrious"". I had read a lot about it, so I bought it, listened to it, and I won't be listening to it a second time.The album is static. There are no changes in tempo. Every song is slow. There are no changes in dynamics. The volume never changes. The songs are indistinguishable to me. There is very little range in Margo's voice. The vocals run in a range betwen middle C and middle G.The pluses are 1) Margo Timmins has a nice voice, albeit in a limited range and 2) the harmonica playing is well done. Other than that, I'm at a loss to understand the appeal of this album."
4,Fantastic album,"The Cowboy Junkies was a fantastic band, and this is a fantastic album. Margo Timmons voice as is superb as the band is innovative."
2,Good intentions not enough,"Good singing but intrumental skills not up to par with those of average alternative band. Meldoies almost pleasing and lyrics a bit pretentious. This band could do so much more if it put its trust in the right producer who's willing to hire some good studio musicians to lend a hand. Sincere effort but better producing needed on next CD. Songs a bit typical of average Alt band- sincere and idiosincratic at best, second rate at worse. Also, cover art looks a bit amateurish - musicians should stick to music. Then again, this is not an art review."
4,A fresh approach to some standards and some new tunes.,Dot Wilder has a great voice and she has a good group with her. They blend nicely and don't let their talent get in the way of a good performance. We have seen them in person and they have fun. It all comes through on the CD. They do old tunes and new and they are all fresh. You will enjoy this CD.
4,Written just for Kids,"This encyclopedia series was written with children in mind. I purchased it for my daughter in the early eighties, when she was about five or six. I now have a son who loves reading the book. I wish they would reprint the volumes again."
5,Lizzy's last and best,"thunder and lightning is just that, thunder sound and lightning guitar from John Sykes. personal favorites on this are the title track and The Holy War, although the whole album smokes. A must have for metal fans and guitar fans."
4,Thin Lizzy - Thunder and Lightning - Japanese Vertigo records release,"Thin Lizzy - Thunder and Lightning - Japanese Vertigo records releaseSadly, Lizzy's last album. Has some great songs, and it is the only studio album by the Lynott/Gorham/Downey/Wharton/Sykes lineup.Tracks are:1. Thunder And Lightning2. This Is The One3. The Sun Goes Down4. The Holy War5. Cold Sweat6. Someday She Is Going To Hit Back7. Baby Please Don't Go8. Bad Habits9. Heart Attack"
3,"The sequel to Man Plus and far less intriguing,","The sequel to Man Plus. This novel was far less intriguing, which is ironic since it played out as a mystery. I we remember the end of Man Plus, there is the implication that machine intelligence has tricked mankind into colonizing Mars in order to protect its own interests (since man might wipe out Earth and thus the machine intelligence too). Mars Plus is a mystery where all the players are manipulated by the machines, but it just isn't very mysterious or clever. I think Pohl phoned this one in without exploring the many facets of what the existence of a manipulative machine intelligence would mean."
3,Just Got Lucky...and not much else,"I love the JoBoxers just as much as the next guy, but let's be honest - after shelling out $$ for a pricy import, the only really memorable songs are the singles we already know and love: JUST GOT LUCKY and BOXERBEAT. SHE'S GOT SEX and a few others are OK in an early 80s quaint sorta way, but the band never really scaled the sublime retro-flashback heights of those first two giddy, spirited, soulful singles. Still, nice to have it all under one package on CD."
4,Easy to use & tasty,The Myoplex products are generally high quality products and this is no exception. I like to take it on the road with me and supplement my diet in the morning by having one of these in a shaker. Great way to add ~40g of protein. No blender required.
3,Planter,"No problem with this product. Its just a little cheaper than I expected but, on second thought, it was cheap to buy too. It will do exactly what I hoped so again-no problem."
5,A very good book,I am oblige to write about this good book. It gives complete information on cervical trauma. I was very impressed with the subject of ballistic injury. I am training in Surgery and keep up with literature in English. But I would like to see this book from Heidelberg in German too. N. Weiler
5,Very good book,"I am very impressed with the contents and the style of the book. It contains all of the basic details in an easy to understand manner. I find it refreshing, easy to understand and easy to remember. This book has helped me to understand the complex nature of neck injuries better. I strongly recommend it to all surgeons in training. Nick Alderton MD"
5,Wonderfully simple and informative book,"I am impressed with the amount of information the author has packed in. The book is easy to read and simple in style. Having read some of the contents in the Library, I have now ordered this book for myself. I am a Trauma Surgeon and in the process of writing a book on Traumatology myself. This book has been a great help and a source of inspiration to me."
3,ok,the documentary is a remastering of a old movie in the times of the war... but not have subtitles in spanish
2,Used to be good,"I have used molding mud for at least 20 years and have always loved it to help hold my curly hair and to reduce frizz. However, the last few years I can tell they changed the formula or something is occuring that causes small hard pieces to be present throughout the mud. When you apply you can't avoid having them visible in your hair. Occasionally you can find it without the hard pieces, but more often than not they are there. I tried writing to the company and haven't received a response or acknowledgement. It is a shame because I can't find a product similiar to this that works as well. Matrix just came out with Fiber Shuffle which is a little stickier and is good-but not quite the same effect."
4,Wonderful woman Jazz Saxophonist,"This is a unique CD in that the featured performer is a marvelous Saxophone player. At times Ms. Grzanna's sound reminds the listener of the late Sonny Criss - sharp and edgy with a clear tone. What takes this recording another level up is the fact that Ms. Grzanna can sing as well as play the saxophone. ""As Time Goes By"" is given a nice ride as is the title track. Yet, it is the saxophone that shines here, and Ms. Grzanna demonstrates that sex doesn't matter when it comes to fine jazzmanship. Buy this CD and try to obtain her first recording ""The Cat's Meow"" - you will not be disappointed. Also, the great pianist Dave Hazeltine is featured on both recordings and his playing is creative - and adds flavor to the tunes."
4,"Solid, ""old-fashioned"" monograph","Hundreds of photos, plans, elevations, sections, perspectives, hard line presentation drawings, models in beautiful colors or B&W on glossy paper, short project descriptions, 10-page Introduction, 18-page project Chronology, 2-page Bibliography, three 1-page biographies, 1-page list of Collaborators and staff."
5,Absolutely great item.,"I've used these devices on three different trucks and they always work great. Rather than buy expensive replacement gas springs which will just leak eventually anyway, this spring-loaded prop installs easily and doesn't wear out. The kit includes a wrench, saw blade, and small miter box to guarantee a straight cut. Once installed, open the hatch and it automatically snaps into place. It locks the hatch securely open, doesn't slip, but releases easily with just a flick of your finger. The factories should install them as OEM."
4,Pure Classics,"From the wonderful ""Pure Love"" to the then-brand new ""Smoky Mountain Rain"", this is Ronnie Milsap at the beginning of his outrageous, chart-topping career. For those that loved Ronnie when he churned out good, old-fashioned country, this is for you. Aside from the fact that a few of the songs are pure depressors, it nonetheless satisfies the hard-core country listener and it is definitely a must-have."
2,Poor Mastering + Missing Tracks = Sorry CD,"I thought I would same some money by buying Greatest Hits vol 1 & 2, Essential Ronnie Milsap, and Ultimate Ronnie Milsap giving me pretty much all his best hits and saving me a handful of green. I learned my mistake as soon as I got to this CD. Not only is there THREE tracks missing on the CD which were on the original LP (and they were top #1s and a #10 too!), but the recordings just sound thin, like they used some cheap $10 proggie to take all the grain out of the music.If possible, avoid buying this set and get the 40 #1 hits set. Or maybe the Ultimate Ronnie Milsap which includes all songs here except for the last two."
1,"Not sure what the issue is, but it is not giving me the promised power.","I wanted to step down 230 / 50 Hz and since the optimization was done for 60Hz, for the devices I planned to use, it did not gave me the correct power output as requested. So for a 1000W 110V, 60 HZ, the step down switched off in 2-3 minutes.Then I used another device of 700W, 110 V 60Hz, and step down worked with out issues, but my device was not performing as it was with the Normal 110V, when I was in USA. So I do not recommend this for any one who need to use 110 V, 60Hz devices."
4,transformer,"Brought this transformer of a higher spec from here with no problem.However, I did buy a 500 watt version which overloaded on its first use and the fuse failed to cut out the power overload from the same source.The result was an electric shock when I went to switch it off. (made in China)Sadly I didn't use it when it first arrived and so lost the opportunity to return it.Having said that - the 1000 Watt version I purchased since works fine and with no problems."
4,good product,This product is good but now I need the upgrade so I can add updates to it on the internet
4,Great HK-movie with female bodyguards in action,"Yes, some of the ""Angels""-movies are not what one could expect or might have hoped for, but this one is different and absolutely worth watching. It has the top-HK-movie-ladies in action, namely the magnificent Cynthia Khan and my favourite Yukari Oshima (also known as Cynthia Luster). Both ladies are in charge as bodyguard for an important businessman. Well, the story will never win an Oscar, but that is not why we are watching this kind of movies, is it ? It is the action that counts, and yes both beautiful ladies go for it ! One of the better lady-action movies from Hong Kong, and that is from someone who has already seen a lot of them !"
1,this toy is LAME! LAME I TELL YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I do not have this toy but I know that Bratz look funny.Their feet look strange.Wost of all is it.I have one Bratz doll. I rated this toy 1 star educational because what does it teach you? how to look better?.(...)
2,Doesn't work,"Am over 60, and this is just another age spot product that doesn't work, so don't bother purchasing it. I didn't expect miracles, but did expect a least some lightening after proper useage."
5,The purest '70s concept album,Ranging from Manfred Mann esque keyboard expertise through soaring love songs - this is a heartfelt and lyrical experience(or at least it was when I was fourteen).
5,Coleman Road Trip Grill Wheeled Carry Case,Amazon did a great job with the orderand and quickly shipped a great product damage free.The case fits the grill and stand perfectly together. The material the case is made of is heavy duty and has nice big zippers. I am very picky about things I purchase and I have no complaints.I would highly recommend this product.You may find it a little cheaper somewhere else but it will cost more due to other company's higher shipping charges.Buy It From Amazon.Gary
5,Just What I Needed,After checking the Coleman website and finding this carrying case I Googled it and found it for about $40.00 at Amazon. It is a great case and well designed.Also the quality and build is great. I can honestly say that this is certainly a great investment if you own a Road Trip Grill.
1,Smells like Gasoline,"We are disappointed in the carry case that we ordered for the grill. When we opened the package, it smelled as if it were drenched in gasoline. We tried putting it on over the grill, but it was not easy or a good fit. Seems like it would be more of hassle to use than not use it. We will be returning the carry case."
2,Roadtrip grille carry case,"In order to use the case, you have to remove the stand and wheels from the grille. What good is that ? How do you store the base and wheels?"
3,does not fit the Paul Jr version,"This case does not fit the Paul Jr version, which i thought was the same as the lxe 9949. But other than that, it felt pretty durable"
1,Throw things at the dog to train it?,"What an awful approach, if the dog ignores a command you scare him/her into action by throwing noisy metal discs at him/her.There are so many positive ways to train dogs there is no reason to scare them into action."
1,Julie you should better not try this again !,"When I bought this CD, I thought, well pretty girl, an actress quite discreet, interesting films sometimes.I can't tell you how much I was disappointed. There's absolutely nothing in 'Julie Delpy' (sorry but she chose to make it eponymous). No voice, except a long and monotone litany throughout the album. No music, except poor, very poor compositions. No lyrics, except depressed sentences but where you feel she didn't really 'believe' what she is singing. I don't know, it's like she's making it for the gallery, to show she's a sad & unhappy person who deserves a better life, which I am sure she's not. For me there is not an ounce of sincerity in this album, it's just empty, without soul and no talent at all."
1,"dull,pretentious and boring","sorry if we,french people are simple minds and can't appreciate trrrrue talents!but this is THE record if you want to comit suicide.I wonder why and how Philippe Eidel (who is a real talent) got into this dull project?"
5,"I like ER8. so, enjoyed this ""Sons"" cd album.","I typing in the exclusive space, and have cup of coffee and my someone's grapefruits 100% juice at lunch time. (Sit, am I yappie who in Yapp island ?) By the way, vnvIJULiE DELPY's cdI I bought it in (in or from, at, with, on, by, ... I do not understand to do on www net, help meI) AMAZON Fr. web preorder. I am just only 38 years old. Aged, pick ups, parties, cars, ... (Sit, am I lady of Ulysses ?, over nature ?, general electronics ?, it is so what ? ...) Songs bring to make me feel ""La belle unique"". Her simple and deep voices with acoustic and electric guitars, with hammer beating, with emortion, and with much more about. This cd is in my best three cds of 2003 year. It is a Great. Thanks Delpy,Julie. ...zzzzzz"
3,"Said good condition, but closer to fair","First time buying used textbook and got this for culinary school and seeing that I don't plan on keeping it, since it seems like nothing more than introductory material, got used one that said condition was good, but when i opened it today, it was more like fair/average condition. the binding is a little loose and not too secure, which is annoying, but it will do it's job and the delivery was quick.Introduction to Hospitality (5th Edition)"
4,A Good live album,"Transatlantic's Live In America is a good album, the first track, epic masterpiece ""All of the above"" version is good, maybe not as good as the studio version, but is well played.""We all need some light"" version is practicly the same of studio album, ""My New World"" version is better than the studio one and ""Mistery Train"" is great, in a medley with Beatles classics ""Magical Mystery Tour (Train)"" and a fabulous cover of ""Strawberry Fields Forever""The Genesis cover Medley is perfect, the introduction of ""Watcher of the skyes"" and a full version of ""Firth of Fifth"", (one of greatest progressive rock songs) with great work of these four talented musicians.The long medley with songs of their four bands, is good with the last part of Beatles ""She's so heavy"", but really is not a great medley; i prefer the original versions of the songs."
3,SO close to what you NEED,"I got to try the thing at a freinds house. It was really really cool, cept for the fact you need to be 150 feet from the comp.This was dissapointing. I was really hoping for a go-anywhere sorta thing. I liike how its a one-payment for life thing, but i think a go-anywhere thing with no monthly payments would be awesome"
1,Overstated range - lousy support,"I purchased a couple of these for my kids for Christmas, 2003. According to the tech specs, the transmission range for these things is 120 to 150 feet.The units we received indicate 'out of range' when taken upstairs in our house, which is about 50 feet from the base unit.I used Motorola's web support site and asked if it was possible that my units were defective. They sent me the URL to an FAQ, which told me that the working range for these things is 150 feet. Very frustrating. It seems they did not even read my question. To add insult to injury, their automated customer satisfaction followup email was emblazoned with the motto 'intelligence everywhere'. I beg to differ.In summary, I do not recommend the IMfree."
4,A Great Buy for the Im'er in your house,"I bought one and love it. I haven't had any trouble with it at all. My only two complaints are that the battery takes 16 hours to charge the first time (10 hours to charge after first charging and use) and only works about 4 hours, and that it only uses Aol Instant Messanger. It has the option to select service at the splash screen, but for the time being, only has AIM. I recomend this product highly. Also, numerous reviews have stated that the computer can be off. It MUST be on while using this product. It communicates through a program that must be running on the computer. If anyone can figure out how to run a program while the computer is off, then maybe you can use it...but untill that miracle discovery, sorry, but the computer must be on."
1,Terrible,"Although this book has received the best reviews from students, as an educator, I hate this book.Besides the fact that the author cannot write, there is no sense of responsibility, call to action, or suggestions for improvement for others in a gang life situation.All this author writes about is ganglife, drugs, violence, sex and glorifies all of them, no wonder my students love it."
5,A very powerful book,This book is the best book i have yet read. It gives examples of what gang life can do to you. It is like a message to young kids who think gang life is the way to go. If a kid is thinking of taking that road he/she should read this book first and think twice. The chilling and frightful events that take place are dreadful. Never before have i read a book that touched my heart in such a way.
5,opened my eyes and mind,the book was great i coudnt put it down it showed me why people join gangs because they want to have the love they never got from their parents and it really showed me that gangs are bad news i too thought that all they did was party and so did he but thanks to this book i know the real deal and being puerto rican and from chicago having kids at school who are kings this book made me realize the real deal with them and what they go through. and i congratulate honor and am prode of ray for not avengeing angels death that showed he really wasnt a coward i hope he completes his g.e.d
5,Stock cars n moonshine,This book just arrived on time yesterdayIt is in the advertised conditionNot been read by me yetMoonshine!
4,You get exactly what you see,"I received exactly what I ordered which was good. Nothing fancy, but looked good at our wedding."
2,A little disappointed,"I bought this after seeing my brother's new Irwin quick lock channel locks. The pair that I received was pretty shoddy in my opinion. The teeth are not square to each other, the slider is tight yet loose at the same time... hard to explain.For $6, it's not a bad deal. But I expected a nicer product from Irwin. Maybe I just received a bad apple? I would not buy again, and it's not worth returning for $6."
3,Be forewarned - this toy might be pink instead of blue,"I bought this bath toy for my baby nephew, thinking the toy would be blue as indicated in the picture. The order didn't ask me for a color option either so naturally, I assumed the toy would be blue. Then today I saw Christmas photos of my nephew opening the bath toy and saw a PINK bath toy instead of the blue! I told his parents I'd have it replaced ASAP. So not sure how best to communicate to Amazon about this feedback since I can't seem to find a feedback form other than writing a public review. Until they fix the problem, keep in mind if you're thinking about buying this for a boy, you could end up with pink instead.By the way, don't pay attention to my ratings since this review is purely to forewarn customers about the color. I hate that I'm forced to rate the product when I purchased the product as a gift. I'm sure the toy is great."
4,Fun in the tub,"The kids really enjoy playing with these. Our only complaint is that you cannot get all the water out of he toy, so you have to worry about it molding on the inside. We let them soak in bleach, but still were unable to get all the mold. Still, with bubble bath & these toys in the water, it's like a safari hunt for them."
3,Order larger size than normal,"Sizes run small for this item, jacket waste length and sizes run small when ordering order one size larger."
5,cool debut,"this is a great album. private future still remains one of my favorite songs.i can't really describe it. it is neat the way they combine daniel's threatening style with david's melody, even though all three of them are wonderful musicians. all of them contribute a different sound to the band. it is what makes them special. they both have beautiful voices in two different ways. wow."
3,Not Bad,"It's a pretty good story, but I think the writer could have done more with the material he was working with. I'll probably read the second book in the series to see how the story progresses, but if it's more of the same I doubt I'll go beyond that."
5,This book is awsome!,"Ok, its not my favorite book but its pretty dang good. It has all this stuff about UFOs, crop circles, and foo fighters. It is so cool!! The reply isn't as good, though. I wonder why they have a swear word on every page."
3,Area 51 Series,"I've read the first four books of this series and while I find it a good read and nice escapist fantasy, it does tend to drag a bit in parts--too many long explanations on the same subject in each book, cardboard characters and minor, yet noticeable, oversights (Captain Turcotte becomes Major Turcotte then Captain Turcotte again). On the other hand Doherty does manage to break up the seemingly constant downturns (the aliens and their Earthbound agents seeming to get the upperhand, for example) with small but significant triumphs. All in all it's a really fun read, and if you're not looking for more than that, these books are for you."
3,Decent read - frustrating edit job.,"I don't normally write reviews - but this book is actually a pretty good spin on the whole ""Area 51"" deal and I plan on reading the series at this point.That said, someone needs to fix the editing on this series, or at least the two I've read so far. There are hyphens where they don't belong, as though someone was typing from a copy that was written in block style to fill the page from edge to edge. When they do that, sometimes words get split to fit on the line, and they get split with a hyphen. Well, when the hyphen is physically typed into the kindle version, it makes the read really frustrating.For example:""The more radical theorists stated that, on their side of the barter, the hu-mans were allowing the aliens to conduct mutilations on cattle and other livestock and also--from the truly radical fringe--to abduct humans for various nefarious experi-ments.""Frustrating to say the least - but don't let it deter you from an otherwise good story and decent read."
5,I love this book,"If you're a QT user, don't forget to buy this book. This book is packed with useful hints and tricks. It's surely going to be useful to you someday.Remember to buy some other books about general video compression theories, MPEG encoding, color theories ... so you'll handle codecs better. This book is not the whole thing."
2,Not among his best by far,"Matheson writes well but this was a more suited to a short story. At about 300 pages it was way too long and drawn out. Some parts were exciting but most was boring and it took too long to get to the ""action."""
2,the anti-climax of anticipation,"I imagine this is what happens when you become a successfully published author... you are able to go back to your fist efforts of writing and sell them not for the story, but for the author's name. I had hopes that the book would turn around with an shocking twist, yet the plot played out like a straight to video 80's action flick. If you need to get your fix of man vs. man vs. nature, save a couple hours of your life and watch deliverance."
1,A couple of good 80's songs,Not many tracks are worth listening besides the couple that made the charts in the 80's
4,"Funky is good, chunky is...too chunky!","I love the salty/sweet snacks and this is no exception. However, they need to do something with the ""CHUNKY"" size bites! The clusters come out in BIG CLUNKS and when you try to break them up, all of the chocolate falls off. And if you aren't careful when breaking it yourself you'll get it all over your clothes. Make no mistake, I LOVE this snack...it is delicious, but it is also messy!"
5,Perfect gift!,A friend of mine recently had miscarriage and I wanted to send her something to brighten her day. I didn't want to send flowers or an overpriced gift basket with barely anything it so I decided to look for something yummy on Amazon since I have Amazon Prime and it would be free two day shipping and low and behold I stumbled across FunkyChunky! Two days later I got very happy phone call from my friend raving about how yummy this was and that she couldn't stop eating it. Success!
5,No mortal band can compete!,This is not the best Racer X has ever given us yet it is still explosive and terrifying. Unlike the previous Racer X material the songs on this album don't have that well rehearsed and almost live feel that we all have come to expect. It is still some of the best song writing and preforming being done a metal album to date though. Every memeber of this band is an amazing talent... I think it would take a supreme lack of effort on all of their parts to get anything less than a high quality album.If you like 80s metal or shred you can not afford to pass this album up.
2,Surprised,I started out this book and really enjoyed it. Then all of a sudden it just started becomeing this story about everything but skinheads. I was really dissapointed about how Frank was portrayed as the only one who was a skinhead for life. Good writing just a misleading title. I think this is just another media to give Skins a bad name. Cheers
2,Puhlease!,Not a fan of this book. I wouldn't recommend buying it if you are over 21 years of age. I particularly don't care for huge coincidences being so central to the development of a story. Total cop out. Best thing about this book is the cover.
2,"Comfortable enough, but it's a defective product.","I ordered this sleeping bag to use during Christmas holiday. When I received it, there is a defective on sewing. Internal insulation material came out and I could see white insulation material between the seams (or joint) because of bad sewing. So, I I returned it at once."
4,Flexible usage for All seasons.,"I brought 2 items for me and wife. Unzipped and piled up,they are like large quilts for 3 persons(they are really big and tall. they fully cover my 4 person Coleman tents!) It has a excellent insulation power. But even if weather is hot, unzipped usage is good for light insulation. So, I'd like to call this 'multipurpose for 4 seasons' External brown fabric is somewhat heavy and durable. so, Don't worry about contamination and heavy duty machine washing. Febreze spraying is recommended for trifling contamination. but pillow is very miserable. first time, I think this is a faulty product. I found 2 pillows have same too small amount of filling cotton. This is not a pillow, this looks like a absorbent swab. These are only things I am disappointed."
2,Very Disappointing,"Where is the trademark driving base? If you're a Waylon fan from back when, you won't want this CD. They've turned good music in to easy-listening elevator [music]."
1,Poorest album of 1979,"Trust Me,DO NOT GET THIS ALBUM.There is 1 song on the whole Cd that is almost ok.I'm A Ramblin Man.But if you would like to buy the worst contury Cd ever.This is your chance."
5,Only the Best,"Waylon Jennings is a musical genius and the best that I know! Once you start listening to his music, everyone else just doesn't add up. No one will ever compare! This is one of my favorite cd's because of ""Mama's don't let your babies..."" and ""Amanda"", and all the rest. I would recommend any of Waylon's cd's."
5,Keeper of the Springs,"Keeper of the Springs is a lovely book written by a lovely lady. It has beautiful photos and inspiring thoughts such as passing on our legacy and being rooted in God. Interspersed are bits of insight from her daughter, Katrine Stewart. It's a book that can be read over and over or simply looked at for the lovely pictures."
5,This book touched me.,It gives the feeling of home right from the start. It is a calming read. I've used it for gifts for people going through difficult things. Recommended for the person who likes to make their place feel like home and has a sentimental spirit.
1,A poor performer.,"I own and use 3 other Lodge cast iron pans which are excellent. I bought this one to cook bacon, eggs and pancakes, thinking the square shape would be perfect. It isn't. The corners of the pan never heat up to the temperature of the center, even after preheating for as much as 15 minutes. The ends of the bacon in the corners never get crispy, the parts of pancakes in the corners never get brown.A big disappointment from a company I trusted."
1,Misrepresented,"This book was listed in the ""new"" column for $25.00. Many student paid less than $8.00 for used books that were much newer! I received a package that stated ""like new"" on the cover letter. I am positive that, upon ordering from Amazon there were two columns that I could choose from, new and used. What I received is a copy of ""strength and materials"" copyright 1964. Not in new condition at all. Bindings are worn from age. I am willing to deal with getting burned for the twenty-five dollars while my peers payed only $8.00 for much newer books, however in 1964 American Physics did not deal with the metric system. My book is so out of date it is almost useless. The seller of this book should be ashamed for their complete misrepresentation of this item."
2,Disappointed,"I was immediately put off by the first chapter where Barnhouse espouses the ""gap theory""You can't ignore passages like Exd 20:11 ""For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them [is], and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it..""That is a clear statement that millions or billions of years of time did not pass between Gen 1:1 and Gen 1:2 and that everything that has ever been, was created in six short days.It's hard to believe his biblical technique or the rest of the book when his foundation is so flawed.Therefore, I am disappointed."
5,This is a Must Read for Believers,I read this book but will continue to review it as the author opens the door wide to this vital spiritual subject. Pastor Barnhouse draws our spiritual eye to the conflict which holds eternal consequence and helps put all things into a realistic perspective. Easy to read but chock full of truths to meditate upon.
3,the WAR part is good,"If you are looking for a book on the war between God an Satan, this book presents a pretty clear picture. The problem is the author believes that all mankind is divided into those that are predestined to Heaven and those predestined to Hell. He gets rather preachy in some chapters on predestination. If you believe this, you will enjoy the book. If you believe something else, the book can be annoying at times."
4,Most Complete Hits Collection,"Too bad you have to buy an expensive import to get all their hits on one disc, but despite the price it's a real good cd. I'm not quite sure why they don't release this in the US. The other hits cd's don't include a lot their well-known songs!"
3,Dinosaur corner,"Supertramp were one of the main perpetrators of 70s Art Rock, but redeemed themselves by killer hooks that compensated for their sometimes twee lyrics. I'm therefore relieved to report that some pleasure can be derived from this collection, if only because of the sublime Dreamer. The lyrics of The Logical Song will make you cringe, while Bloody Well Right is a good example of how a clever hook can make up for silly words. For the surviving fans this is a good buy."
4,This is Gold,"I was sitting on the computer today listening to ""Neon Gold,"" loving every minute of it; When it hit me, I never wrote a review of it, even though I have had it for months. Well, better late than never, here it goes.This German quartet were originally a hard-core punk band. Their first two CD releases were punk all the way, not until their third release did they start sporting around with electronica.Their gradual incorporation of indie pop songwriting and championing a total electronic sound put them on the map for me. They new sound seemed to give Notwist more focus and feeling.Taking cues from the likes of ""Sonic Youth"" and ""Autechre"" this CD is right up there with ""The Postal Service"" and ""New Order"" as being near perfect music.Indie Electronic is a great direction for these guys. Lets hope they remain on this path. I am sure if they do it will bring us more great music in the future."
1,barely made a difference,"didn't really make a difference, too bad it was easy and priced right. i ended up ordering the tc -770. it works great and has more options that i may use."
4,Sounds great for the price.,"It sounds much more warm than other phono preamp that I have, that costs more than twice the price. Unfortunately, the connectors are not very well constructed, so you may have bad contact."
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,I got this to use with a Denon receiver that did not have phono inputs. It was simple to hook up and works well with no noticeable hiss or hum (be sure to run a ground from the turntable to the preamp). What more can I say?
5,Does the job.,"It works, it sounds great. It was not expensive. I use it to connect aAudio Technica Phono Cartridgeto aGriffin Technology iMic USB External Sound Card. The iMic is supposed to be able to handle vinyl without a pre-amp, but the result sounded muddy to my ear. With the Pyle PreAmp in the signal path, I got beautiful, rich sound from my records, the way they used to sound. I can see on the scope that when there is no signal, the pre-amp generates a flat waveform: no noise from the preamp. It works. I'm happy."
4,Can't Complain,"I bought this for now until I can afford a better preamp, but this is all you need for your fairly basic setups.Pros: CHEAP, and sounds okay.Cons: this does have some signal noise as the ground that is built in is not the best in the world.All that being said if you can only spend $20 this is your best bet, and unless you want to speed above $100 I would choose this and nothing in-between."
2,Nothing New,For most logistics professionals this book won't offer much new information. All the math in this book is already well known....so don't expect any new handy dandy formulas.
5,Will NEVER be better than THIS baby!,"My God I feel like such a MANLY man whenever I make this skillet hot! And it works like a dream! Now that it's well seasoned it's better that ANYTHING Teflon, glass, ceramic, stainless, ANYTHING! Very good design. Great even heat. Seasons well."
4,Lodge at Amazon,"Lodge items are great, but the delivery time on these items at Amazon is atrocious. My order from early October hasn't shipped as of early December, partly due to my having deleted an item from the order in early November. I had no idea that deleting an item would restart the over-a-month lead time on the whole order and nothing in the order changing process lets you know it or gives you the chance to ""undo"" the deletion..Amazon has a great selection of Lodge products at great prices, but be prepared for a long wait and DON""T change the order."
1,Sorry to rain on people's pet parade...,"but, in my humble opinion, this book is one of King's worst. It's not believable. It's not a good read. It's predictable and formulaic. It's not frightening.It reads like a book King was obligated to write, but didn't want to. As a former King fan, this is one I just can't recommend."
3,Very overrated!!!,"While the book had a great degree of originality, it did not have the intense excitement of other King books, nor did I ever feel I could not put the book aside until maybe the last 50 pages. I did make illusions to Salem's Lot and The Dark Half, which was quite clever."
4,One of his absolute BEST novels ever written,"One of Stephen King's best, I'd say this has to be in the top three novels he has ever written. Intensely dark and frightening. Creepy, disturbing and depressing. King drags you into a living nightmare. You both love and hate him for it. This one will haunt you for quite a while."
1,Not scary at all!,"Stephen King have tried to write a scary book, but he hasn't succeeded at all. Almost nothing happens throughout the book, the characters are impossible to imagine and the part that's supposed to be scary is the most boring part of all. Don't buy this book if you're after a scary one, this is only for the ones who dosn't dare to read a normal book."
1,NAAAH,"I absorbed all the 5 star reviews for PET SEMATARY and ordered a copy.Nuthin much happens for about 75 pages; its entirely inane chatter. Then it gets interesting when a kid dies following a car-pedestrian collision. This is followed by more inane chatter between the characters ad nauseum.The bottom-line is: Stephen King has about 5-6 terrific plot points he failed to exploit in this tale about zombies. The plot points jolt you, and then nuthin much follows until something new jumps out of the bushes and screams 'boo!'It woulda been a horror classic if King stuck with one theme...like...zombie kid spills the beans on everyone and everybody. Maybe the cat could spread the zombie virus around by scratching people.But this book isnt worth fooling with unless you like mind numbing chatter and being frustrated one time too many.My other gripe with the book is, the seams show. Stephen King calls this 'seeing the zipper.'"
4,Pet Sematary,"This book was interesting to read. It has some vrey dramatic turns throughout the book. The thing I didn't like about this book was the long periods of time that Stephen King spends talking about every little detail. It got really long and boring in some parts. For the most part I thought it was an excellent book. If you like horror books, Stephen King writes the best. I recommend this book to anyone who likes horror books. Stephen King is an excellent author."
4,Insanely Enjoyable,"This book is very good. King is so good at descriping things I could of sworn I could actually smell the sickness of Rachel's ill sister. I could feel Church, the family cat, rubbing against my legs and the anxiety the powers of the Pet ""Sematary"" brought. This book will have you guessing all the way through. This is great King, but not if you aren't used to his stuff. Not for first time King readers. You guys go read ""Carrie"" or ""Salem's Lot"". Then read ""The Stand"" and by then you should be able to read Pet Sematary."
5,The King at his Greatest,"This was probably one of the best books Stephen King has ever written and goes up there with ""The Shining"". ""Pet Sematary"" keeps you on the edge of your seat and they did an excellent job on the movie. They didn't ruin it like they do with most of his movies. I would definitely read this book."
5,PET SEMATARY Will Scare You Back To Life,"PET SEMATARY remains (in my words) one of Stephen King's best books written.The story concerns a man who moves to the country with his wife, daughter, son, and pet cat. There house is located near a ""pet sematary"" where people in the past have buried there pet animals that were killed on the highway. There is also another cematary connected to the ""pet sematary"" and it happens to be an ancient Indian burial ground that can supposedly bring the dead back to life if they are buried there.Even though this book is total fiction, the combination of supernatural folklore and reality-based situations might make some readers uneasy.Stephen King also wrote the screenplay to the film adaptation of PET SEMATARY."
4,Scary!,"While this book didn't seem as scary to me as it did to some people, it's still pretty scary. Basically, if you bury something in the burying ground behind the Pet Sematary it will come back to life, so Louis Creed couldn't resist the opportunity to do that when his young son died. Read it, it won't dissapoint you."
4,Pet Sematary,"Where do you begin to describe a story such as this one? I read this book in the October of 2000; I wasn't ready for what I dove into. I won't give away the story, but let me just say that it had me disturbed for days after I finished reading it. The story itself doesn't really have any elements of terror until the end, which is probably what makes this book so unique and different from othe suspense novels. I haven't read tons of horror, but I have read other books by King and Bentley Little, and PET SEMATARY still holds on strong. The ending lingers in my thoughts and the characters are still so real, their situation still so depressing. What makes it a masterpiece is the fact that King keeps you reading despite the fact that people aren't getting slashed up throughout the book. He scares you with the very idea of death and the desperation it brings. He reminds us that sometimes ""dead is better."""
1,It would have been nice if ...,"In virtually no place on Amazon's website, is there the warning that the digital edition is NOT a CD --you must download it from a website-- and the only way you can use is if you have a WinTel machine: The download is an .exe file, and that doesn't work with the Mac OS.Next, any document worth owning anymore, is a PDF file, which is completely searchable. It takes up very much less space that program written specifically for the task. Additionally, Adobe's PDF documents work across several platforms.The people responsible for this should be ashamed of themselves, to think that the only computer operating systems used by law professionals are WinTel machines."
2,just not as expected,"once you have read the bif hard cover copy, thois leaves a lot to be desired, coulf not recommend for ant legal purpose pu it on the shelf and there it sits period"
2,no dice,In my case it did not work...maybe it works better on other people if you want to try it good luck
1,This has been useless for me.,"I took this product faithfully for 45 days and saw no change in my weight. I wish that I had followed my instincts and better judgement and not spent the money on this product. Sadly, I bought into Dr. Oz's recommendation and let myself fall into the trap of hype."
2,"Average Quality, Not Formatted like State Exam","I purchased this review cd a few months before I graduated from paramedic school with the intent of using it to review for both the class final and the state exam. It took nearly three weeks to arrive, which is somewhat understandable since it's not an Amazon product. The questions were elementary with a low difficulty level that really did not compare to the format of the actual state exam. While purchase of this cd is good for someone who wants to brush up on their paramedic knowledge base, it may not be the best for individuals who only begin reviewing for a state or national exam a week or two before the test date. Additionally, the new ACLS and CPR guidelines are not included and the med math questions are of minimal help in test preparation. Conclusively, I recommend this book to the more seasoned medic reviewing for a promotional exam or a refresher course more so than for the new medic studying for a licensure exam."
3,"Funny, but...","I'm a Howard Stern fan, and I'm familiar with Artie's work, but i just don't find him to be as funny as other people do. The script is written on about an 8th grade play level, and the acting was choppy.It's good for a few laughs, but I would waste my money buying it. See if you can borrow it from one of your friends."
1,"Artie is Funny, Bear League is Not","This movie was a big disappointment. I am a huge Howard Stern fan, and definitely appreciate Artie on a daily basis on the show. Going into this movie, I had extremely low expectations as it was. I was expecting a ""so bad that it's good"" type of experience,"" and would have been happy with at least some cheap laughs. What I got, however, was practically no laughs, long periods of boring and a lot of looking at my watch. This movie even managed to go below my already-low expectations. There are no original jokes, and the main subject of the movie - softball - completely gets overshadowed by the dragging plotline - if you can call it a plot line. The bottom line is this movie is not fun or funny. It's a complete misfire. This is definitely a netflix type of movie because if you buy it you will kick yourself!"
1,No,"I love Artie. I really do, but I could not get into this at all. I'm aware of the troubles he was having when he filmed it. The jokes and dialogue are hard to follow at times. This was pretty weak. Nonetheless Artie rules as a comedian. He is one of my favorites of all time and I totally recommend his book ""Too Fat to Fish,"" but not this movie. His other work, ""It's the Whiskey Talkin"" makes me laugh myself silly the whole time I watch. Long live Artie Lange. Lock up the beer league master in a vault and never let it out."
4,Very Very Funny,"I picked this up as a birthday gift for my other half. It was just too funny. On Days we feel like laughing, it's the ticket."
3,OK,"Frank's singing is great and the band is tight, but at times the vocal backings are kitchsy. The tracks with just Frank and the band are better. :-)"
1,What a waste of money.,"I was so excited to get these drops because I am doing the HCG diet and can't have anything in my coffee besides stevia. I wanted a little flavor. I am drinking a cup of coffee right now with twice as many drops as it recommends on the package and don't taste a thing. It is a little sweet but no trace of chocolate or raspberry. I put the lemon in my my water last night, again, sweet, but didn't taste a thing like lemon. The only upside is that the liquid stevia tastes better than the dry so at least I can use them to sweeten."
3,Not actually in a tin,"I was surprised when I received this and it was actually in a disposable cardboard box, not a portable tin case as suggested. Not very convenient for on-the-go stevia use. Also, the droppers are plastic and I'm not sure if they are refillable or not.I do however love the flavors of the stevia. A few drops of Lemon Drop is great in a bottle of water."
2,aftertaste,The lemon and orange have a strange aftertaste..not impressed with r his product. Hoping to use the vanilla ans c hocolate with my coffee..no way..just doesnt taste good.
5,great way to try a new item,"This is a great way to test out several flavors of stevia sweetener without making a major commitment. I found that I really like the Vanilla Cream, find the Chocolate Raspberry alright and didn't get a lot of flavor from the Orange and Lemon. Now, let's have the same with English Toffee, Peppermint, and any two other flavors! Stevia is the only artificial sweetener I can use, so having variety in the flavors really helps. The Vanilla Cream is excellent in iced tea!"
4,Not too strong,"I have tried two different brands of liquid stevia now. Sweetleaf certainly has more flavors, and it is not too strong. I was surprised at how small the bottles were in this 4-pack. All the flavors in this pack are good. The other brand that I have bought is a little stronger (fewer drops give a stronger sweetness) but once you get the taste you like, all is good!"
3,"OK, but more stevia than flavor","I bought these looking to make my own version of ""MetroMint"" water. The stevia is very sweet, but unfortunately it overpowers the taste element. That might be OK if you are trying to just make an alternative to plain water, and you want something else sweet like coffee. I really wanted just the flavor essence, so I am glad they offered these in a trial size. I think they will work really well for flavoring plain soy or almond milk ""ice cream"" this summer. I went and looked for other flavor drops and found that the Capella drops (not the ones with stevia) work well to flavor water to taste just like the Metro water brand. The Dutch Mint Chocolate flavor is right on. I also use them to flavor already sweetened Vanilla almond milk. The Sweet Strawberry flavor makes very yummy almond milk indeed! (by the way, I bought the Capella drops direct from the manufacturer's website: [....])."
1,ehhhhh,"Had no taste, don't know what people see in them...it was a waste of money to me, ill give you mine for free."
4,Easy entertaining history,"This is a very easy read. Fast paced, really no slow dry stretches that I so often find in history books. I had hoped Duby would include more of the actual primary source, which is the biography of Marshal commissioned by his son after the Marshal's death. Duby speaks to the biography and pulls out pieces here and there for color, but I would have liked to have read more of it. Having said that, this was one of the most entertaining and interesting books on knighthood and the Plantagenet era that I have come across. Marshal was a true player in the historical events of the time, and his rags to riches story is very engaging."
1,Great treatment of the realities of 12th c. knighthood,"Georges Duby knows the original sources about French and English knights better than anyone else alive.Here he writes about one of the premier English knights of the 12th century, a man who rose from poor knight to Earl of Pembroke and Regent of England, a man who made his fame as a champion of tournaments in their early days as rough mock battles.William Marshal was so famous in his own time that a poetic biography was written about him: the first biography ever written in French.Duby brings this document to life, and gives us a feeling for the days when ""you found the champions under the horse's hooves."""
4,Pretty Good,"I do like this towel and use it all the time. I've read reviews that say it absorbs the water so well that your hair is almost dry when they take it off. NOT SO !!! I have long thick hair (and it all fits in the towel just fine) but when ""I"" take it off, not only is the towel soked so is my hair. I've even had to wrap my hair in another towel, when I take this one off, to absorb the excess water. I just like how it's quick and easy to use."
3,Adventures in success.,"I have all my cd's split into 12 different categories, and I still fail to find the right spot for ""Welcome To My Dream"". Is this rap, jazz, spoken word electronica, or just ""alternative""? Maybe that's what is appealing about it. Without a doubt what got me into this in 1992 was the track ""Adventures In Failure"", and it remains my favorite on the album. But I also really like ""Falling Elevators"" and ""Hearing Voices In One's Head"". There's also a track or two I always skip, hence the 3 stars. But if you do pick this up, be sure to play it while the ""City Sleeps""."
4,Gnostic scriptures,This is another well researched book by author and modern theologian Elain Pagel.For the unitiated it provides an intriguing insight into the gnostic influences in the letters of Paul.Together with her other excellent works it adds to an understanding of apocalyptic sources and it's relevance to understanding the real message of Jesus.
4,Battles - Mirrored,"When Battles' debut, MIRRORED, comes on with the frenzy of drums of ""Race: In"" (quickly augmented by a twitchy guitar and some whistling), you know you're in for something new. Though you could classify them under the vague, amorphous term of 'post rock,' they forge their own direction with their careful instrumentation and tighter song structure than is ordinarily associated with 'post rock.' ""Atlas,"" for instance, has a real swagger to it, something you'd stick your hips out to. ""Tonto,"" on the other hand, is looser, but still with a forward drive, while ""Rainbows"" revels in its dissonances and its januty mid-section, culminating with a bold vocal finish. ""Snare Hangar"" takes a severely syncopated rhythm and offsets it with playful vocal piping. The final track, ""Race: Out,"" adds some looped strings into the mix, as well as those thundering drums. A album, definitely, to reflect upon."
4,Sure Is Out There (In This Case A Good Thing),"I first came upon these guys by seeing the video for ""Atlas"". Immediately intrigued, I delved further into the craziness that is Battles. It took a while for this album to catch on with me, but once it did I was hooked. Aside from ""Atlas"", the highlight here for me is ""Tonto"" which has hook after catchy hook.The rest of the album is equally as catchy, but it takes some time for the listener to fully appreciate the album. It's not for the casual music fan, it is definetely an experimental band. Pop this in, sit back, and fade away into the madness that is Battles."
2,What Happened to Battles?,"I liked the Battles EPs I'd heard - they're one of the most intricate math rock bands around. Which is why this album was so shockingly disappointing. The backing band stays pretty much the same as before, but a top layer of insufferable ""Alvin and the Chipmunks""-style ""vocals"" have been added to the top. Perhaps some people can look past this (or even enjoy it??), but I'm not one of those people. The vocal tracks add nothing to the music and almost completely take away my enjoyment of Battles' precise technical mastery."
3,A chair of a different color,"We were fairly happy with the quality of the chair itself but not with the color. According to the picture, the ""pecan"" chair is a light color wood but actually comes a rather deep shade that doesn't come close to the picture published in your website."
5,This Popover Pan Comes Through,"I have tried to make popovers in muffin pans and the results were pretty sorry. I live at 7000 ft elevation and a lot of things are challenging when it comes to baking. A squirt of non-stick spray in the bottom is all you need and they just come right out of the pan. No issue. The recipe with the pan is a little rich and I use 1 cup flour, 1 cup milk, 2 eggs and 1/2 tsp salt. Preheat oven to 450F. Bring oven to temp. Heat pan for 2 minutes. Pour batter into hot pan and bake at 450F for 15 min. Then lower temp to 350F and bake for 20 min more with no peeking and you should have the most wonderful popovers ever. We use them with butter and jam for breakfast and to sop up gravy and juices from pot roasts, stews and soups. This pan is everything that it promises to be."
2,Limited Info Value,I am sure there are much better books out there on table saws. This book has a limited amount of information.
5,great game for beginners,"It starts easy, which is encouraging for beginners of Sudoku.Now I'm getting better and hooked on it."
2,This is Nat King Cole's sleepy material,"The late Nat Cole is one of those treasures of American Music. He was a great Jazz pianist and singer, no doubt. Also a stylish balladeer with great albums but with some neglectable ones.This EMI twofer shows two sleepy albums. One with a great repertoire but with such boring honey and sleepy arrangements by Gordon Jenkins. Another with neglectable material and arrangements.Two songs are featured originals: Edward Redding's 'The End of A Love Affair'and Jack Segal's 'I Keep Going Back to Joe's. Great songs.Here you'll find Mr. Cole at his best in vocal performance but ...A Note on UK's EMI twofers: it's incredible that we could ever have the opportunity to listen to such old and rare material. EMI has issued a long series of CD twofers in a memorable initiative to show all the splendid material by splendid artists never before released in CD."
2,Mantilla,"This is a beautiful product, just not the one pictured. The mantilla in the picture is MUCH larger than the ones I received. Bought two (one for favorite aunt's birthday) and was disappointed."
1,Save your money and buy a better product!,I made the mistake of purchasing this microwave from Target a while back. I should have just spent a bit more and bought a decent microwave. This was the absolute worst product I have ever had the displeasure of owning. It lasted all of 3 months and died. I have vowed to never ever purchase another Emerson product. I still don't know what happened but one day the display went out and that was it. It never started again. It went out in the trash the next day and I purchased a Panasonic.
4,Joseph Arthur shines stronger than his shadow,"I have been listening to Joseph Arthur since his release Come To Where I am From. For me that is one of the top 10 albums of the past ten years. Redemption's Son was also a very great album. Taken on its own Arthur's newest release stands by itself as one of the best albums of the year, but compared to his previous works it is not as strong.For new listeners there is a lot to love. ""Can't Exist"" is great single and very accessible. This album is a step forward and it very satisfying to hear Arthur develop as an artist. Our Shadows Will Remain grows with repeated listening, hopefully with some more commercial success Arthur can continue to make more meaningful music."
4,A Joy to Read,"This book is a must-read for anyone who has studied under the Cornaro Window in Thompson Library at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY. As you may know, the stunning Cornaro Window at Vassar celebrates Lady Elena Cornaro, the first woman to be awarded a Ph.D (University of Padua in 1678). This book describes Elena's life in 17th century Venice, including her relationships with her parents, teachers, and friends. It was refreshing to read a biography about a humble and formidable person. I highly recommend The Lady Cornaro - Pride and Prodigy of Venice."
5,Love these,"The tubes are great. If I could afford it, Id buy a bunch of packs of these and go crazy with them."
3,Tube are fine,"The tubes are nice, my gerbils seem to enjoy hiding in them and being able to go to multiple places. My only difficulty is the connectors-- they're extremely hard to get on and off of the tubes."
1,WRONG ITEM,"I ordered these for my super pet critter trail cage and they do not fit! there is absolutely no way they will fit in with the cage. I spent like $13 and i wasted my money! I am very upset with this because i was so excited for my little dwarf hamster to have fun. But now she can not. BE CAREFUL when you order you may get the wrong tubes!!UPDATE: However i did contact the seller, which was Ozbo, & they fully refunded my money and apologized. So if you are trying to take the cheaper way out...Don't. Because you might not get what you are looking for."
4,"A little hard to take apart, but great otherwise!","As others have mentioned, these are a little hard to take apart and snap together. However, this is a minor issue, as it's not extremely hard or anything. They seem fairly sturdy, so I'm not afraid of them breaking. I would rather they have a strong connection than easily falling apart. Also, they connect easily and firmly to both my CritterTrail habitat AND my Habitrail habitat, which is what I wanted. I was really glad to find these here for about less than half the cost of other places. All-in-all, a good buy. :)"
1,Teddy Bear Hamster Danger,"I bought these and a new cage for my adult teddy bear (syrian) hamster to give him more room. He is normal sized for a syrian, and determined to squeeze his way through anything. He got halfway through the tubing and became stuck. He was panicked because he couldn't move at all and was squeaking angrily. I had to pull him out by his bum because I could not unhook the tubing easily enough to pull the tube apart. This product is not appropriate for hamsters other than the very small ones. The product claims it is for hamsters in general and other small animals but in fact it is only good for mice sized animals. Thankfully Amazon allowed for a return and refund. I'm very disappointed with this product."
3,it was nice,"This book started off well. Good sexy hero, interesting strong heroine and a background that had potential.Unfortunately though, there was nothing too special about this book. Despite the potential for all kinds of interesting developments, Ms. Barton didn't take advantage of them. Caleb had a debilitating injury and a lot of guilt to work through. Sheila had a secret and a mother's protective instincts. And they had a history. An eleven year old history.As a result, this became a romance between 3 people. The sexual tension and emotional turmoil that can really be explosive when stretched between a couple was diluted to include the needs and desires of the child.After this series I think I'll stick to Ms. Barton's longer titles where she has room to really show her talents."
5,my daughter LOVES it!,"My 2 & 1/2 year old daughter loves this thing! It's a cross between a pacifier and security blanket for her. She sucks on the tags which is a little gross but we have 2 of these books and wash & rotate them constantly. She sleeps with her taggies book, and if we are going on a long car ride we let her take the book and she is out like a light in 5 minutes! I would recommend these books to any infant or toddler!"
2,Soooo disappointed!!!!!,"I wish I had listened to E.Buhkman of Ohio's review, instead I went with the others. I have owned at least four other brands of juicers, for the money this is probably the worst. It produces very little juice and it stopped the second time I used it, while only juicing carrots and cabbage. I was really looking forward to the extra large chute(BAA HUM BUG!!!) it is only slightly larger than the Juiceman juicer. I had to clean it after two carrots to get it to start again. When I pushed the on button it hummed and gradually started again, only to give little juice,I found the rest of the juice when I squeezed the pulp. It was medium as far as sound. The basket takes a little extra to remove. I gave it two stars because it looks cute. If you still want to purchase one of these, I'll gladly sell mine."
5,less foam more filling,I have owned all the juicers this is the one to own and think it is imperative for people to understand this juicer was truly designed for the hardcore juicer because if you have a very fast juicer it can deplete the nutrients you are tryng to achieve with your commitment to live foods you waste money on foamy juice the 221 sacrificed some efficency in order to give you the ideal glass of live food. so if your life is based on convienceyou might as well get your really efficient high speed bottle of snapple
2,CANT BELIEVE I WAS SENT THIS!!!!,"I ordered the Thompson DVD ROM replacement drive for the XBOX. The drive was sent to me on time, but it was horrible. The drive was dirty, rusted, bent up and looks like it came out of the trash dump. It doesnt work, I dont understand who thought it did work or would work. I will never use this company again. Horrible."
4,bumping new jack swing cut,i like the way the kissing game by Hi Five was the cut back in the day. RIP Tony THompson nailed the vocal leads proper. Teddy RIley was unstoppable as a Producer back in the day. the groove and feel good spring vibe of the song.i use to groove this jam a whole lot back in the day and it still sounds crisp and Proper.
5,"Thought provoking, Insightful and wry","Having lost my first hero some time ago I still use his good humor and even temper as a base for my life. Although I'll never be him, it is doubtful anyone will ever be me. I read this entire book of quotes in one sitting. I have passed some quotes along to people I know will get something from them... To this book I would add this toast ""To Our Fathers... and their Sons."" If ""Father"" is a special word to you, Buy this book. Buy several in fact and give them as gifts. They will be appreciated"
3,weakest effort from CF since Please...Die,"While not terrible, Carnal Forge's latest, Testify For My Victims, is their blandest output in several years, after many stellar releases. A lack of variety and dynamics on this record make it possibly their least enjoyable, yet, but it is still good Swedish death/thrash, head and shoulders above the pretenders'."
2,Hanu,The peas are way too salty to eat I talked to the owner she did't care about the condition of the peas.
2,"Nice looking, but clasp is bad","Looks great and very sturdy, but the clasp does not hold well. It easily comes open and the cards can fall out. I asked for a refund same day I received it."
4,Card Holder,The card holder does work. Keeps things well orginized. I would buy again. The only problem is it cost me more for the shippimg then the porduct it self.
2,Shoddy design,"This looks like an excellent case and would be if the snap-lock closure worked properly. The item I received immediately popped open again after I closed it shut. Even after tinkering, I couldn't get the case to close properly and finally gave up, using a rubber band to keep the case shut.It would also be nice if the case could be fastened (via clip) to other items. As it is, it tumbles around in my purse or camera bag and can be troublesome to find, not to mention that I'm paranoid about it falling out and getting lost.I like the way the SD cards fit into the provided slots, but that's about the only thing going for this case, in my view."
4,Readable Tables,The tables in the covers of the book and the appendices are very helpful and easy to follow. One compressibility chart was found to be incorrect but overall a good book
4,Chemical Processes,I am an engineering major & I bought this book for my chemical processes course. The book came in good condition. I find the the chapters informative & helpful. The problems at the end of the chapter provide a lot of good practice.
4,Good Product.,This was a very good book that I enjoyed and helped me immensely with class. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because it was an old version of the book that looked nothing like the picture shown.
5,Easy to read,Communicationswith the computer are becoming more and more human-like. Giving a computer a feminine voice affects how we respond to the computer's output to us.
1,Very Poorly Made,"I never wrote a review before because I always believe products are hit or miss, but this game is poorly made it cant be played properly. The game can be educational, but with the white clips coming undone and and the pictures constently falling off you will get to frustated to finish. I guess things are not made like they used to."
1,No hardware or insturctions included,"The hitch looks okay but all that came was the hitch...no hardware, no manual,no hitch cover....nothing that was advertised in the product description. Also, we were overcharged. We have spent way to much time (not a toll free phone number) trying to resolve this mess. They told us to contact the manufacturer to get the missing parts. We did contact the manufacturer but they told us that since they sold the hitches to AutoParts Way, (and AutoParts Way has our money) and AutoParts Way sold it to us that we would have to get the parts from AutoParts Way.We are currently trying to work with AutoParts Way to get this resolved. Will report on how that goes as we find out. We are hoping that this is not a scam."
1,Poor Quality Assurance Measures,"I ordered this Hidden Hitch along with the Adapter. However, the hitch has a hole that was punctured inward where the the adapter should fit. This has caused the adapter not to be able to be inserted where the pin lines up. My choice was to send the hitch back or manually saw off about 1/2"" of the adapter in order to make it work with the hitch. Very unsatisfied with the lack of quality checking before shipping out to customer."
4,Ambiguous Tale of Coming of Age and Holocaust,"Thomas Moran has made a wonderful debut as a fiction author with this compelling, chilling, moving tale of Niki Lukasser growing up in Nazi Austria with a Jew, Dr. Weiss, walled up for his own protection, in the barn. This is an unusual story but it is created and built up in ways that make it believable. No good deed or bad will go unpunished and betrayal is an always quietly lurking shadow among the people. The relationships are complicated, particulary the child and the man in the box, and the author makes ambiguous all the various choices of the characters. There is no black or white, good or evil, just people making good and bad decisions, often for very personal and odd reasons."
5,Survivors tell their stories.,"I have the book, Schindlers List & I wanted to get this to go with it. I was lucky & found a copy of Schindlers Legacy at a garage sale (one persons cast off became anothers treasure). I paid 25 cents for it & it looks hardly handled! So now I've finished reading it. The stories of 40 of the List survivors who came to live in the U. S. are reveting. They keep your interest peaked. These are some of the people at the end of the movie who place stones on to Oskar Schindlers grave marker. A human life saved is definately a legacy. Oskar Schindler left a big legacy in that respect. This is a must book along with Schindlers List to have on the holocaust. First person accounts to show the neigh sawers who claim it never happened."
5,Wes: Great player and composer,"Wes Montgomery is the father of modern jazz guitar. His style sounds fresh today. But, he also composed some incredibly catchy tunes in this hard-bop style. ""D-Natural Blues"", ""Mr. Walker"", ""West Coast Blues"", and my favorite ""Four-on-Six"",have all become standards and are played here with elegance, logic and a tremendous sense of swing. You'll never tire of this great music."
2,Overly bright and harsh sound.,I love the content of this album but wish I could find the same material with better sound quality.
3,These work good - for awhile,These work great in the aquarium when new but over time they tend to grow stiff and then separate from the tank wall.Just be sure to have extras on hand.
5,Great Games!,This was a great game sthat our !st grade teacher told us about. The kids love it as well as myself. Kids of all ages would love it!
4,2 CD Set,"FYI - despite the fact that Amazon lists this as having 1 disc, this is the full 2 disc compilation."
5,Great book with lots of helpful hints.,At first when I purchased this book I was very skeptical but after reading I found many insightful things that maybe should have been obvious. But someone like me does not always see the obvious and purchasing this book will in the long run make me a nice profit.
1,bad product,Not thing is stuck inside of the line but water does not run.My friend gave me a different one that works so good and I amreally happy with it. I will never buy gravel cleaner fromFLUVAL.
3,Good Light but not a good value...,"I know everyone says SureFire is the best around and stuff like that but I'm here to tell ya...IT'S NOT! While they do make good lights and I certainly WON'T discourage anyone from purchasing a SureFire light, the name can only go so far. If you look on Amazon alone, you'll find much better values all around that are brighter, run longer, costs LESS!, and come with more stuff. Yes, SureFire makes a decent product. Is it the best value? Surely not...Here's some things to look for when considering a Xenon Tactical LightLumens which is the brightness(SureFire G2 is 65 Lumens)Run Time which is typically up to 1 hour for this kind of light (G2 is 1 hour)Accessories included (G2 includes the batteries only)Construction (I Prefer Anodized aluminum) (this G2 is plastic or ""Nitrolon"" as they call it;)Warranty (SureFires come with a lifetime warranty)"
3,Computer Reader slot cannot read,"Will not read from my computer card reader slot. Have to use cable from camera. Would NOT buy again for that reason. This is, apparently, the result of newer cards being incompatible with older computers so be advised. I don't know if older style cards are still available and, if so, what they are called or how they are described."
2,No card reader,"Please be advised - contrary to the other feedback, this does NOT come with a card reader!"
1,ITEM PICTURE MISLEADING -- NO CARD READER INCLUDED,"The item picture shows a micromate, which is why I purchased it, but no micromate card reader is include. This is false advertising or outright hucksterism. Poor job!"
5,Great Reference Book!,"If you want a fairly good TO&E; on German armor and artillery units, this is the book. It cover early and late formation and some of their combat (combat not in any detail though). Mr. Nafziger gives good detail on each Panzer and Artillery unit. For historical TO&E; data on the these German units, this is the book to have.Bruce"
3,For the Heavy Handed,"FilterStream V2100 may be too heavy for seniors. This isn't a miracle vacuum, its just an industrial version of a dustbuster."
4,This series just keeps getting better...,"All of Valerie Wilcox's sailing mysteries have a compelling element in them, whether its the main character Kelly Montgomery, descriptions of sailing in Puget Sound, or Kelly's relationship with her adopted daughter. In Deception, it's all of the above, plus a darned good mystery.When Kelly's friend and client Paul Crenshaw is arrested for murder, it's tough to tell whether Paul's silence is fear of self-incrimination or innocent bewilderment. And if not Paul, the obvious choice, then who? Wilcox had me going until the end, which is exactly the way I like it.Good going! Looking forward to number four."
2,Pretty Dissappointed,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He used to be a HUGE Harry Nilsson fan. My husband only recognized 3 or 4 songs on the CD. He used to have 5 of his albums, so we didn't think you could really call it Harry Nilsson's ""Greatest Hits""."
5,NILSSON FOUND HIS NICHE,"A recent event demonstrates the impact Nilsson had on our ""pop"" culture. I was in the hospital for major surgery and several nurses and aides were doing their usual poking and prodding. One tired aide said she was looking forward to going home and put ""da lime in da coconut"" which prompted me to start an impromptu warbling of Nilsson's crazy ditty COCONUT joined by everyone present. A cute jig ensued capped by high fives and lots of laughter. What a deiightful moment! That's the effect much of the late Mr. Nilsson's music generated.This 20 track tribute demonstrates the singer/songwriter's versatility and talent. From WITHOUT YOU, his monster #1 single to the gorgeous REMEMBER, Nilsson's unique vocals and creative expertise are evidenced magnificently. This is an extremely enjoyable album and a fitting legacy to the unique Mr. Nilsson!"
5,Music that can be listened to again and again.,"I'm a little annoyed after reading what the critics had to say about Springfield. I was angry and disappointed. His music is a lot more than the sum total of his greatest hits, and later works such as ""Tao"" and ""Rock Of Life"" show increasing development. Yes, Rick could sing hits with the best of them, but please also listen to the passion and pain evident in his other recordings. As far as a dance record, or feel-good collection, ""Greatest Hits"" can't be beat."
1,Hacked up...,These songs are hacked up versons of Rick's music. I played it a couple of times until I got the library of original LPs. The Lps are better. At least they carry full versions of songs. I pass on Rick and this package. RCA cheats people out of good music...
4,Excellent book for children with new siblings!,"This book puts words and pictures to many of the feelings young children have about having a new sibling in the family. The ""Gran"" in the story helps children to manage their feelings, answers questions, and ultimately reintroduces Darcy (hence your own child) to the family. My favorite book to give to families with new siblings, thought not easy to find."
4,They are a bit tight,If you have muscular or are on the bigger end of the spectrum these will be a bit tight. However they are comfortable for me so far. The fabric is soft on the skin but I havenmt used them too long to see if wearing them long term would cause shafing. So far for 30 minutes of use they are good.
4,Fits as advertised,good fit.heavy enough for a meaningful pull to ankles.does not have metal fittings like the reebok brand so safe from abrasion.not very bulky and can be worn for general walking also.
5,Dr. Hallowell is wonderful,Dr. Edward Hallowell is a parent or teachers best friend when it comes to ADHD. I've given this DVD to my mother-in-law so that she can beginto understand her grandaughter.This program is a MUST SEE.
1,"Terrible, inconsistent sound","Downright amateurish! That's all I can say about this one. It was obviously thrown together as a quick, cheap after-thought by pulling various cuts from previous reissues and assembling them without regard to their sound. Some of them are muffled and bland. Others are tinny and squeaky. A few sound good, but they all should. ""I'll Never Smile Again"", one of the most moving TD recordings, is horribly marred by some kind of filter being turned up and down at random during playback.Awful, guys! Just awful. Should be done over."
3,Buy Only If You're A Die Hard James Brown Fan....,"...I don't know what really happened when Brown recorded with Full Force, but this CD smacks of initial and youthful enthusiasm at the top to outright anger in the middle to ""Just let us get through this session"" on the later track, ""Can't Get Enough""....James then seems to be saying ""Well, lemme go on back to what I know"" on the track ""It's Your Money""--it sounds like 70s style James Brown and the JBs. In my opinion it has one great, great track which is ""Static"". You have to be a big JB fan to get to the rest."
2,not impressed at all,Bought last year. First time I used them the chicken I baked stained it and now it has a big mark on it. These are not worth the money; the cookie sheets I bought at wal-mart are equally as good and cheaper to boot.
1,A Divine wind THAT I WISH NEVER BLEW MY WAY!!,"This book SUPPOSEDLY won the Children's Book Council of Australia Award. What are we doing to our children??? I'm sure most will get more enjoyment having teeth extracted by a blind dentist, with hands the size of shovels."
2,The Divine Whine,"The Divine Wind is a beautifully written book, there's no doubt about that. The descriptions and setting is written wonderfully. However, the plot is way too similar to ""Snow Falling on Cedars"", has rather dull undeveloped characters, love with hardly a mention of the actual falling in love and a selfish and self-absorbed main character (Hartley Penrose) you dislike after a few chapters- who unfortunatly narrates the entire thing. The plot dragged on and on and on. Perhaps Disher would make a better poet."
2,"Works well, but ...","I wanted to try another CF holder, i have the ""Vanguard DI Holder 6 Plastic Memory Card Holder"" and works better than this for the following reasons:* It close better, i mean, it have a kind of a botton than close better than this aluminum case* The rubber part (The one that holds the CF) is well attached to the case, so when you remove de CF it wont come out.I regret to try another item, so i have to fix to the Aluminum one:* Bent the little part so it close better* Glue the rubber part.Conclusion:NOT BUT THIS ONE, BUY the ""Vanguard DI Holder 6 Plastic Memory Card"" (http://www.amazon.com/Vanguard-DI-Holder-Plastic-Memory/dp/B00026C9II/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1263756478&sr;=8-1)"
3,Depends upon experience.,"This is not a bad book and I'm not going to trash it. It is, however, like many of the Amherst Media books, a little disappointing for anyone pretty far along in the business. I would consider it a complete beginner's guide to modeling and model photography. In that light, it's a useful and interesting book. I found the photos to be less than stellar and a bit dated, but this is totally subjective. (You can see a lot better by browsing the showcased photos on OneModelPlace.com.)The entire book left me wishing for more. With all this stated, I did learn some things from this book, which probably compensated for the cover price. In short, don't expect miracles from this book."
5,Exotica,"This, if you haven't heard it, is an exotic, ethereal, overlooked gem from the 1980's, that stands with, say, This Mortal Coil's ""It'll End In Tears"" as one of those brilliant pieces of Dream-Pop of the period. A Japanese vocalist with a gorgeous, ethereal style sings in French. How's that for world music? On the Crammed label."
5,Hands Clean CD1,"This single is excellent. It puzzles me that it wasn't released domestically. The two extra tracks should have made it on the LP. At any rate, I recommend this cd - this is classic Alanis at her finest.1. Hands Clean2. Fear of Bliss3. Sister Blister"
1,Quit your stupid fighting! (I'm actually a teenager who's over 13),"Okay... you little kids have a serious problem. I don't even think you like these stupid little dolls of yours... I mean how can you play with them when you spend all your time fighting and insulting other little kids through the internet. if these dolls are as good as you think and say they are... SHUT UP AND PLAY WITH THEM!P.S.parents, don't read these reviews. More than half of them are actually arguments by little dorky girls that have nothing better to do with their lives than play with bratz or barbies and insult people through the internet.P.P.S. NOTE TO ALL LITTLE DOLL-PLAYING PEOPLE: You can write more insults for the rest of your lives for all I care... and feel free to insult me but I'm sorry to say that I'll never read them because my life isn't that boring."
4,RE: Beautiful,I would get Tokyo a-go-go Yasmin. I have a Tokyo a-go-go Sasha and the Tokyo a-go-go dolls are verrry prettyy and they have nice clothes and mine is very durable.
2,cute but painful,"I bought these b/c I have a few areosol shoes and they have all been my most comfortable shoes. However, these are not. I have had them a month and they hurt my feet so much. My little two starts to stick out the side and the entire leather is ridged. They have not losened or become ""broken in"". I would suggest any other heal than this.....unless cute is all you want."
4,Cute shoes!,Shoes are really cute and more comfortable than most heels. Very happy with this purchase!
1,"Disappointed, it is not a sequel but the same movie.","Godzilla Fans: My son and I have recently made it a father and son event to order and watch Godzilla classics and I sincerely regard all of the movies as classics. When we saw the title Godzilla vs. Mothra 2, we immediately ordered the movie, believing it to be of course, the sequel to Godzilla Vs. Mothra. My son was very disappointed when he watched the movie and recognized that the only difference with the two movies described is simply the title and cover box. Would you please make the necessary changes to this advertisement because it is deceitful and deceptive. Just to show you what kind of Godzilla Fans we are, and to demonstrate that we do not foster ill thoughts about this purchase we decided to give the second movie as a gift to one of our family members. However, please correct this advertisement at your earliest convenience...Luis..."
1,Not worth it,"There is no way the potatoes are having the same crispeness or flavor like the fried ones.And besides the most annoying fact is that ,the nonstick coating came off on different places,exposing the aluminum under,and that happend the 4th time after I cleaned it.And I always used my plastic sponge made for cleaning nonstick surfaces.Now ,I have to throw it away because of that cheap coating is mixing with the food and might be dangerous.4 batches of potatoe for $25,that is how much I paid for the bakeware.Stupid!."
5,Awesome book,Alan Watts was way ahead of his time - the Eckhart Tolle of the '60s. About the oneness of life and the ego's illusion of separateness.
1,...bleh.,UGGG!!! I hated this! I felt as if I would rather listen to a dentest drilling.Take my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS!
3,"Cute results, a PAIN to clean","This pan makes some very cute little cheesecakes (and other treats from what others have written). I would give it 5 stars if it weren't such a complete pain to clean it. It's very hard to get into the corners and normal sponges and scrubbers are too big. I am still trying to find a mini scrubber that can get in there (a sponge isn't strong enough). If I didn't sell cheesecakes in my business and need to use this pan, I actually wouldn't because it's really that obnoxious to clean."
5,Great Pan,"This pan worked perfectly for mini cheesecakes. Because I had to make more than 12, after completely cooled I froze the cheesecakes in the pan. After frozen, I popped them out and removed the bottoms so I could make another batch."
1,Beware!,"I've had two of these carseats so far - the very thing that made me like the seat kept breaking! The ""quick release"" dial kept breaking - Evenflo kept sending new seats because it was a ""known problem"". We switched to a Graco seat with a normal pull at the bottom release, and while it took more getting used to, it hasn't broken."
2,The Seat is Safe but too Difficult to Adjust,"This seat ranks very high on consumer reports and is priced reasonably; however, I found the straps to be extremely difficult to adjust. I would not recommend purchasing. I picture myself taking my baby in and out of the car in the rain, adjusting, etc...too much of a hassle for something I'll be using all the time."
4,The LA-Z-BOY of carseats!,"Our son started in this seat (different upholstery) at five months (rear-facing) and rode in it until 3 yrs/11 mos. Our first daughter started in hers at 6 or 7 months and is still happy in it at 2 yrs/2 mos. We will be buying the seat for our second daughter soon. PROS: Comfortable! The kids love it. We have slender kids of medium height. Easy to adjust fit. Pretty easy to buckle/unbuckle/tighten/loosen straps. CON: Very large, especially in width. We have a mini-van with ""captain's chair"" seats, so it's no problem for us, but a regular sedan would have little room for other passengers if you have one carseat, and almost no room for other passengers if you have two. Of course, that's true with most carseats!I would have rated it 5 stars if its shoulders were not so wide."
2,"heavy, bad slipcovers","I have been using this carseat for my 16 month old since she was about 6 months. I hate the strap system, it is really hard to loosen and tighten, and the slip covers are only held on with elastic on the arm rests, so my daughter is constantly pulling them up and scratching at the styrofoam underneath.She has also had her arms caught in the strap holes more than once, especially when she was smaller.It is also very heavy and awkward to manouver in and out of the car. The hooks for the latch system are also hard to open when you want to remove the carseat from the car. I have seen Britax seats that have much more sensible hooks.I would invest the money in a nicer model, if i had it to do over."
3,Good for smaller baby or as an alternative to an infant car seat,I got this carseat from a friend who's 2 year old was on the bigger side and no longer could use it my 2 year old is on the smaller side and even he looked big in it. The straps were easy to adjust in the forward facing position but rear facing they were very difficult to adjust. The recline is wonderful it was useful in the forward and rear positions. The biggest problem was the bulk of it this carseat weighs ALOT and is hard to carry and manuver so not good for getting in and out of a car. the curved back also made it sit ackwardly in different styles of seats so deffinetly test it first. I ultimately got rid of this seat because the straps mildewed in my inlaws basement and don't come off to be cleaned.
3,A decent book.,"This is decent. Not good, not bad, but decent. It features Mulder and Scully going against some weird force that's apparently setting off miniature nuclear explosions in a position to destroy those who have advanced the technology of nuclear weaponry. Kind of ironic, huh?Mulder and Scully's dialogue stays pretty well within the boundaries of their characters as laid out by the series. I could see this being an X-Files episode.But like I said before, this is merely decent. The prose isn't breathtaking. There are no incredibly deep philosophical moments. No new ground was really exposed with the characters, but that's an impossibility with a series-based novel. The bottom line is that this is just vanilla. Get it if your a hardcore X-files fan, but otherwise? Fahgeddaboutit. There are much more interesting science fiction books, like Cosm and Mysterium."
2,Okay if you're not expecting much...,"This book was not well thought out. Muldar's jokes are made without regard to the urgency of the situation. If you and your partner were standing alone at night in a spooky ghost city and armed soldiers appeared out of nowhere, would you crack a joke? If the U.S. military needed to blow up a pyramid would they attack it with a mortar? Would that even be enough? The firefight scene lacked realism. If you were the head of a small unit in a firefight against a much larger force and some FBI woman started lecturing you while your men died, would order her to her tent and stand guard outside?"
4,Anderson did a great job of capturing the spirit of X-Files.,A great book! Kevin Anderson did a masterful job of capturingthe personalities of all the X-Files characters. Loved it!!!
3,FLASHPOINT,I've seen many Donnie Yen movies. This movie was not one of his best. His movies IP Man original was anexcellent movies. Would recommend to anyone
5,Quality Action,"What has been coming out of Hong Kong cinema these past few years is of such quality that Hollywood and NY studios need to examine their ethos of mass produced, redundant, non-creative, money first products. In particular with regard to the action thrillers genre. This movie contained a moving storyline with diverse characters, realistic acting, creative martial arts stunts and chase scenes different enough to capture the viewer's attention and not put them to sleep from boring repetitiveness. When actors are willing to risk injury to add realism you can only be impressed."
1,Very grainy picture,I bought this camera recently and found the picture to be really grainy and out of focus.I would never suggest this camera to anyone.I would recommend the Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX.I've used this webcam before and it has excellent picture quality.
4,I'm not returning this.,"At first when I received this webcam I was a little disappointed. It seemed a bit blurry and I wasn't sure why. After adjusting the lens a little bit I could finally see everything clearly.It's not a great deal. But it worked out for me. =D I used the Webcam Live! at first, and I can definitely notice the 30 fps."
5,Good quality and ease of use.,"While no consumer level webcam will ever deliver the quality of a professional grade cam or even use of surveillance cameras, the Live! Pro USB 2.0 flavor of Creative's webcam does remarkably well for itself. Several different recording resolutions for the camera and use of stillshots with fairly high resolution option is excellent to have if you want to take snapshots. Installation of the webcam was a simple and quick task. Overall, I would recommend this over most other webcams on the market at this time."
4,Its a nice web camera,I bought it Aug 2006. After 3 months I am very satisfied with its image/vedio quality. Liked its auto-zooming feature.
3,"Nice Picture, Annoying Features","Lovely image, actually. But the face-tracking leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe it's just my shiny head that confuses it, but it usually ends up tracking with my eyes at the very bottom of the frame. Also: if the face tracking lets the camera zoom in that far, why isn't there a plain old zoom feature? I like sitting about 3 feet from the thing...but the field-of-view is so wide then... Also: focusing is a bear. The lens wobbles when turning the focus-ring.I won't return it, but I won't buy another one, either."
2,Works but,"Scroll lock doesn't work to switch between computers when a computer is turned off or running linux. The OS shouldn't matter, but it does.Hotkey on both scroll lock and numlock. I use numlock for numlock so switching computers using this key is inconvenient. This is a common mistake made my KVM manufacturers and often hard to determine using their documentation."
3,The Light In the Piazza Burns Clear,"Having listened to the music but not having the privilege of seeing the Tony winning musical, I have to say I was caught up in the lovely, light music and the crystal clear voices of the performers. It took a good 3 ""listenings"" to help me to decide that I did really like this musical. Although the music is not as memorable as some, it has it's moments and I have enjoyed listening to it over and over. I was a bit disappointed not to learn of the secret of Clara in the libretto but I still enjoyed the overall performances and voices."
1,Save Your Money,"""The Light in the Piazza"" is not a very good show and the music is appropriate to the general qualtiy of artistic expression."
1,What are these people listening to?????,"The majority of the reviews for ""Light In The Piazza"" speak of the beauty of its melodies and bringing life back into musical theatre. I'm sorry but I don't know what CD these people are listening to!! The show, onstage and on CD is plodding and utterly boring. There is not one song, and I use that word sparingly, that stays in your mind. I'd compare it to really bad Muzak...and let's face it, Muzak is bad to begin with. Don't waste your money...go buy a Richard Rogers musical and enjoy the beautiful songs and melodies...His grandson needs to listen to his shows and stop trying to be in a medium where he clearly is over his head."
1,save your money and stay away,"Adam Guettel might be Richard Rodgers' grandson, but you'd never know it from this atonal mess. Not one good song, not one. If you haven't had a really nasty headache for a while, pop it in your CD player. The soprano alone will set your dog to howling. A huge disappointment and a waste of time and money."
4,not bad,"this ring is okay, is very small though and feels flimsy, but it is only a ring. the picture makes it look bigger, but it is about the size of most womens rings."
2,Need at least a Batchelor's degree,I'm sure the authors are eloquent people but I found it very difficult to make sense of what they were attempting to portray. I felt I was at the University being lectured by four-star professors who assumed my IQ was over 200?Could not grasp it but I'll try again!
2,depends on who you are,"As a historian, I was not impressed with the contents of this book. It was recommended to me by a non-historian who likes it."
5,Clegg reinvented,"The Priest of Blood, Douglas Clegg's new book, gives us a complete new world of supernatural weirdness. He takes the fantasy and horror genres and slams them together to make a dark, compelling, and strangely beautiful world. This is Clegg stepping up from ordinary genre horror and flexing more powerful creative wings."
3,"Well, ya gotta like dark, so ignore this review if you do.","I don't like dark fantasy/horror. Although one could argue what other type of horror is there, I know. A whole lotta suckin going on and I didn't really get any entirely new flashes in the vampire thing. The writing was most excellent, wonderful prose, beautiful sentences. I just didn't like the story but if you like dark and dungy bloodletting and stuff you would love this. Oh, by the way--- the book did provide the first I-can-almost-feel-it description of getting, well, sucked I've ever read."
2,Same Stage--Different Lighting,"Long time Erasure fan straight from the 80's. I have collected and collected. I have gone out of my way to get import singles before internet purchasing was an option. Erasure is my favorite. They are the only repeat artists in my collection, so it was with saddened heart for me that when I listened to this I heard all my favorite music with completely different words. Some say masterful. I say Huey Lewis and the News on this one. Sorry."
4,Bark but less bite,"In the summer of 1971, I won this vinyl playing some crazy game of chance on the boardwalk at Seaside Heights, New Jersey.I played it all summer. No one mentions that when you take the brown wrapper off a dead fish is on the cover. It's good music but not worth the prices listed on Amazon.At the end of the summer, JA played at some off the wall race track in S. Jersey and they performed all the songs from Bark live including Somebody to Love and Volunteers. I don't rememeber White Rabbit. Papa John cranked up his electric violin, Grace come out on stage w/ a giant snake wrapped around her neck and some loon was walking around selling sunshine out of a garbage can. Bark may not be the best JA album and it certainly does not compare w/ Kantner's Blows Against the Empire, but it is good music and for its time it passed along the social commentary we needed to hear.'In Nineteen hundred and ninety-five all my people rose from the coutryside.'When the earth moves again."
3,Underrated,"This is the Airplane's most underrated album. It's usually bashed by the critics along with its inferior follow-up ""Long John Silver"".Jorma and Grace completely saves the day here. ""Feel So Good"" and ""Third Week In The Chelsea"" would both become concert staples of Hot Tuna and rightly so - they're great. ""Feel So Good"" rocks and ""Chelsea"" with its sparse arrangement is pure heartfelt Jorma.Grace's ""Crazy Miranda"" is another piano ballad of hers while ""Law Man"" has great bass work from Casady.But the biggest mystery in Airplane history has to be why they let new drummer Joey Covington get *two* (!!!) songs... If only Dryden had stayed."
3,The worst Jefferson Airplane album; turn away!,"Marty Balin's departure right before this album went into production, along with drummer Spencer Dryden, brought Joey Covington into drums and a welcome addition is Papa John Creach, the electric violinist. One good song on this is ""When the Earth Moves Again"" and ""Law Man"" isn't too bad, but Joey Covington's nasal voice is worse than Jorma Kaukonen's, who is at least listenably nasal! Skip it and go for LONG JOHN SILVER, with the better post-Balin studio cuts."
2,Ergo chair,I know why it's so inexpensive. It was difficult putting it together for the bolts and holes didn't match up.
5,As promised,As a social studies teacher Korea:The Unfinished War is a good review of just what happened 1950 - 1953. I am grateful for the work that went into making this set available.
1,JC,"Oh how we adored the late seventies,early eighties !! Especially with the rotund ones personal playlist at the Leeds Top Shop. (I think Moyles' still shops there from the peek at the pictures inside this first completed book !?)I guess the rest of us will have to wait until October when he's finished with the crayons and writing by numbers simplicity that this tome affords us,before we can fully appreciate the fantastic insight into the inner sanctum of Chris' world.JC need not worry about 'The Gospel According to Chris Moyles"".........Jeremy Clarkson,I mean of course !!"
2,simply another faceless progressive jam band,This does not live up to superfans' 5 star ratings. These are merely tunes off Manzanera's and Eno's solo albums. They also include remakes of a Beatles' song and Kinks. I'm not a big fan of remakes but these guys do a competent job and enliven these tracks. Nice bass playing in the style of carp and some cool keyboard work but it never seems to gel. I guess for those of you who are trying to relive your younger 70s days this is ok. But this is merely a prog supergroup with no direction. For Transatlantic lovers everywhere.
5,BluRay D/H M/F Clint Eastwood,"If you remember these movies from anywhere, you'll get a new visual experiance with this BluRay DVD. I highly recommend this DVD. Sounds and sights are excellent...!"
2,No results.,I bought both the scrub and the cream. I am almost done with both containers and have not seen any real results. I am 22 years old and I have only recently started to see cellulite in my thighs. This product did nothing for me. It was a waste of money.
5,Only thing that has worked,I bought the smaller size and was so happy with the results that once it was gone I bought the larger size. You have to use it twice a day and it says to use it for 6 weeks. The cream doesn't work ocer night but if you use it like it says you will see results in the 6 weeks. My husband compliments me about how much better my legs look since using the lotion.
1,Waste of money!,Used it for months and it did absolutely nothing! A complete waste of time (applying this product 2X per day) and money.
4,Down with cottage cheese!,"I am not extremely fat (yet), but I just turned 29 and even though I exercise 5 times a week, my thighs are starting to become rebellious cottage cheese factories. So I figured I'd try this product. My first fat cream ever. The product smells like menthol/mint but is not terribly offensive like a skunk or sweaty jockstrap or anything. And it takes a long time to absorb, compared with regular lotion, so you have to walk around your neighborhood pants-less for about twenty minutes longer than usual...putting you at a higher risk for a complaint or even public indecency charge. Walk quickly and get back indoors to examine the results. This miracle whip is pricey - when used as directed for 2 wks, I've already gone through an entire bottle. But I think my thighs do look a little smoother. I'll give it another month (two more bottles?) before making my final judgment. (Coincedentally, I've also replaced all the lightbulbs in my house with dimmer ones and that helps tremendously)"
5,Kenshin gets another 5 stars ^^x,"While they're not the BEST episodes in Kenshin they leave a lot to be said and a lot of questions to be asked. 'specially after the last episode on the DVD itself. Not only that but there's a new opening theme song which is just as, if not better then Freckles! Don't believe me? Download the song yourself! (it's called ""Half"") Also the new ending theme song, 4th Avenue Café plays too. ANYway it's a lot more serious Kenshin then goof Kenshin. Which isn't nessecarialy a bad thing, it's just different. 'specially when he says to Misao ""I really don't care whether you like me that way or not Misao dono"" Also... thought you knew everything there is to know about Saitoh? Well guess again! ^^x"
1,Broke after first use,"It broke after the first use. The motor is self-destructing; plastic flies out the back when I pull the trigger. I was trying to find a brush cutter attachment that fit but was having trouble. But I guess it no longer matters since it's broken.Of course my return window is long gone (30 days?), and of course I did not keep the boxes it shipped in so returning it for even a partial refund would be a hassle. I am going to see if McCulloch will honor their one year warranty - I will update this review as I progress."
3,Not what I expected,"I was expecting something else, more recipes, more elaborated and a little less bland. She's been a fantastic woman and artist but as a cook she was, in my opinion, so-so."
4,popijopi king crimson,This album is very popi jopi. The popi jopi music is inventive and popi jopi. Buy it and you'll have a popi jopi time!The lyrics are popi jopi too!Vocals: popi jopiGuitar: popi jopiBass: popi jopiDrums: popi jopiKeyboard and mellotron: popi jopiPopi jopi popi jopi popi jopi!!!!
4,The Dragon's Legacy,"Omigosh ! I whole-heartedly concur with Fae Folks' review. The story cannot possibly end now. Although the battle for Pretava and Ventra Jalum is over (for now), the saga is far from over. Many loose ends definitely puts the onus on the author to follow up with a sequel (or two). I suggest (okay, I'm begging for more ...) she owes her loyal following some closure on all the characters that we have come to love or hate. She can't possibly leave us hanging like this. We have invested too much imagination and interest to be satisfied without knowing how eveyone's post war lives have turned out. Once again the author does a fabulous job of sucking you in. Once she has her hook in you, there is no getting loose. If there is a sequel (please, please, please ...) I will one of the first in line to get it. Thank you, Ms Reynolds for you wonderful books."
5,sonic bdsm porn,"The band assaults the ears with their extensive array of sounds and knocks you out. All the riffing is over-the-top in excellence. And the drums are played like riffing. If I was in Iraq and the Marine Corps was coming, this is what would be going through my head. The REAL shock and awe.They should have hired these guys to do the Dune soundtrack. There's all these great aggressive macho harmonies and syncopations that mesh far better with Herbert's SF classic."
4,One of King Crimson's finest,"""Red,"" ""One More Red Nightmare,"" and ""Starless"" are three of the best songs in King Crimson's history. John Wetton's vocals are clean yet piercing, Bill Bruford's drumming is excellent, and Robert Fripp is just one of those classic guitar gods who plays with such originality that he helped to transcend the way the damn instrument is played. This album is probably the best showcase for the band's talent during this particular lineup."
5,Timeless,"King Crimson forces you to travel inside yourself and discover your deepest responses to the world around you. The music and lyrics are such that you cannot hear either without being deeply effected. I first heard this music when I was about 19 or 20 years old, and I'm 51 now. It still moves me. I recommend this selection to anyone who loves lyrics, anyone who loves ""underground music"", anyone who wants to complete their history of rock collection."
4,In The Court of the Crimson King,"Recently I came across an article, I think it was like ""The Top 30 or 50 Rock Recordings or Albums"". Listed high was this album. The only cut off of the album that I had ever heard was the title cut. So, I decided to go for it and order it. I've listened to it twice now, and it would say that it's definitely in there!"
2,"Awesome album, but scratched","I absolutely love this album, and if you can get it from a reputable dealer NEW, get it. But be wary of who you get this from. My copy was very scratched up and would skip briefly every 12-15 seconds on several tracks. Awesome album, not awesome cd."
5,"34 years later, still fantastic","Hard to believe I bought this back in high school in '69, and it still blows me away 34 years later. When I first heard the opening track ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Robert Fripp was a genius, and through him I got into Brian Eno, Genesis (with Peter Gabriel), Yes, Emerson Lake & Palmer. But this album started it all for me. You know, in 1968-1969 rock music hit a fork and took 3 different roads. With the release of the first Blue Cheer LP in '68, heavy metal was born. And with the release of the first Stooges LP in '69, punk rock was born. And with the release of this first King Crimson LP in '69, progressive rock was born. And I always enjoyed the progressive road. By the way, to all the original fans of King Crimson, check out anything by the Flower Kings. They are making today's music that was started right here. Peace."
3,WARNING! THE REMIX IS NOT THE ORIGINAL! 5 stars for the ORIGINAL LP;,"This is one of the all time best lps ever! Don't trade your lp for a cd though! That's the mistake I made. The degree this has been retooled and remixed time after time is a crying shame. Unlike most rock remasters that settle for maybe a bit of extra clairity or brillance; this disaster in the making sounds more different with every remaster until I barely recognize it. The end result is very vibrant, and the notes just don't come when they should. My opinion; don't mess with pefection"
5,In my top five,"What is there to say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece? Released in 1969, King Crimson's ""In the Court of the Crimson King"" is one of the most credited albums in the kick-starting of the prog rock movement. An album that's atmosphere, creativity and style remain nearly unsurpassed forty years later. King Crimson's mix of poetry, trippiness and mood on this record truly makes for an experience like no other in the genre, or even in music in general. A completely essential record that easily measures up to the best efforts of Pink Floyd and Rush."
1,2 WORDS: SPINAL TAP,"This pretentious shlock is hilariously bad. It may be awful, but at least its good for some hearty laughs. If you like this stuff, listen to ""Stonehenge"" by Spinal Tap. The only difference is that Tap is TRYING to be funny. Drug use is the only excuse for this tripe-oozing swill."
1,The Judge Gets It Right!!!,"King Crimson are just plain rubbish. Does the Judge understand what rock and roll is all about? Listen to what he he telling you to listen to-the Velvet Underground. They are rock and roll, they define rock and roll, they are all that is great about rock and roll. King Crimson [...]. To like then is to admit you don't like rock and roll, or music for that matter. If you have to ask what rock and roll is you'll never understand it - the fact you are defending this [...] band proves it!!!!!!"
3,A Mixed Bag,"King Crimson's debut effort, In the Court of the Crimson King, should get an award for the album cover, which is very cool. Beyond that, the album is fairly up and down. The title track, ""The Court of the Crimson King,"" is nice but not great. ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" has some very unique and interesting vocal work, but ""I Talk to the Wind"" is a mellow, bordering on dull, track.Overall, I can tell these are well written songs, even if they're not ""my thing,"" so to speak. A good album, and for prog rock aficionados, I can see why it's regarded so highly."
4,La Lear Covers compilation,"Not bad compilation of covers from Eurodisco Queen encompassing some of her later versions, Copacabana (not the version on the Forever Glam cd or the bad single), Love Boat, These Boots are made for walking. Earlier tracks such as Fever and C'est si Bon...what is missing though are her versions of As time Goes By, Bye Bye Baby, Magic Moments and Bel Ami. Also interesting that Lear would go on to record a true album of evergreens and standards 'With Love' a year later. But this is not a bad compilation by any means."
4,Excellent Preview to New Features,"This album contains manipulated preview tracks from New Features. Namely, tracks 5 and 6.... in dub.Some of the finest groove and listening music around, HIM takes what started with James Brown and moved to the Talking Heads and melds it into a sound all their own.It's heavily produced music perfectly engineered to sound completely natural, and the melodies and manipulations will circle your head for hours. Match this with the excellent Sworn Eyes, the Great Curve-esque Our Point of Departure, and the groundbreaking sendback New Features and it is obvious that HIM has something to offer that you won't find elsewhere."
4,Good Movie,"Few of us have much insight into history outside of the United States, so this is a good tutorial, if you can see past the personal character dynamics. Gregory Peck is really the stand-out in the film and Smits is passionate and compelling in his role. Jane Fonda plays a fairly believeable naive spinster, who finds herself immersed in a world that she knows nothing of, but she rallies her spirits and makes the best of her unexpected situation. Some surprises."
1,Worthless and a waste of money.,"I agree with the other one-star review that it's basically like putting your hand in a sock. I ordered the exact size I needed (I found the sizing information on a website) and it did fit my hand, but there was NO support whatsoever. I can't see how this would do ANYTHING helpful--especially for me, as I was looking for something to give SOME type of support for my wrist. This had ZERO support. Plus, if you wear it on your right hand, the black logo/text is on the top and looks bad. I would return this except I have to pay to return it--so I'm out the $2 to ship it to me and probably another $2-3 to send it back and that's over half the cost of the stupid thing.I would NOT recommend buying this unless you can try it on in person. This was a total waste of money."
1,Still waiting for a replacement,"I found this glove, when received, to be flimsier than expected, and too big for my hand. I submitted an exchange-for-size request and heard nothing from the company. I mailed the glove back to them with a self-addressed stamped envelope--and have received nothing in return. I won't buy from them again unless they make good."
2,"I got beige, not black. Be careful when you order.","I generally don't care about style. There is nothing stylish about these gloves, and I didn't expect them to look ""cool."" I did, however, want, and expect to get black. I ordered black, and got ugly flesh colored glove. The difference is that the black looks professional, and the beige looks like I'm a hospital patient.I also made the mistake of not ordering two. This is the only time I can remember buying gloves singly. I buy socks in pairs, shoes in pairs, gloves in pairs. Two feet, two shoes. Two hands, two gloves. Right?Yes, the description for this item does indeed say ""glove"" but if someone is not careful, they might not notice.As for the therapeutic effect of these gloves, the jury is still out. So far, they're pretty good."
5,the perfect balance,"The perfect balance of his early , quirky , decidedly British vocal pop-rock-art-love-songs, and his gorgeously ethereal, instrumental soundscapes. My favouite of his early solo work. Solid ."
5,Classic Eno before ambient.,"I bought this album back in the 70's when it was first released, I still have it but didn't get to hear it too often. Now I have the CD, I listen to it in the car and the memories keep tumbling back. It's amazing how fresh it sounds and how it has influenced many of the pop stars of today. I remember categorizing some of the tracks as having ""movement"" like 'In Dark Trees' and 'The Big Ship' ... in fact, I hadn't heard anything like it before. 'I'll Come Running' still sounds corny in it's twee way, but my wife likes it. 'Sombre Reptiles' is still awesome. What is Brian doing these days? I remain one of his biggest fans."
2,Contains Very Weak Shorts.,"I am a very big stooge fan. Therefore, I have seen every short, especially the Curly ones. The shorts contained in this collection are:1) Boobs In Arms (1940)2) Back From The Front (1943)3) G.I. Wanna Home (1946)4) Wee Wee Monsieur (1938)5) No Dough Boys (1944)6) Dizzy Pilots (1943)In my opinion, ""Back From The Front"", ""Wee Wee Monsieur"", and ""No Dough Boys"" are weak shorts. And another thing, when you see the cover of this DVD, you will notice a typo. The title is ""G.I. Wanna Home"", NOT ""G.I. Wanna Go Home"". There is no ""Go"" in the title. That is such a common error. I don't understand why it is that difficult to get a simple title right."
4,Everything is not great,"but then again, it's still Eno. Did you know ""Kings Lead Hat"" is an anagram for Talking Heads?"
4,Fine set of 80s videos,"I couldn't find anywhere on the Internet that lists the full track listings for this video. Now that I've snagged a used copy, I can tell you that it includes:Shock the Monkey - Peter GabrielMad World - Tears for FearsIs This the World We Created? - QueenIt's My Life - Talk TalkDissidents - Thomas DolbyCrushed by the Wheels of Industry - Heaven 17Turn Your Back on Me - KojoHistory - Mai TaiWings of a Dove - MadnessStrange Frontier - Roger TaylorBlasphemous Rumours - Depeche ModePush and Shove - Hazel O'Connor & Chris ThompsonBird of Paradise - Snowy WhiteSave the World - George HarrisonTotal time ""approx. 60 minutes"".And remember, ""All artists' royalties from this video go to Greenpeace."""
4,Exercise with Elmo,I bought this for my twin girls for their third birthday... They love Elmo so much... They have been enjoying this DVD so much already... It's definitely in our rotation of favorite DVDs already..
5,A 2 year old favorite!,"This DVD was given to us as a hand me down and my daughter loves it! We watch it at least once a day and she would watch it more if I would let her. The acting isn't the best, but my daughter doesn't seem to be a film critic. She enjoys the music and is learning to hop, jump, about elbows and knees. It is great to get her up and moving and also has helped to boost her vocabulary."
3,"Menza, Menza","Not the greatest video or even an exersize tape for that matter, it was cute and all, but it is in no way, shape or form a means of getting your kids to exersize more-they do have a few get up and move stits-but other than that it is not what the heading claims.The 3 best Sesame Street videos I have are: ""1,2,3 Count With Me""-with Ernie as the host of the video, ""The Great Numbers Game""-with Telly and Elmo as the hosts and ""Lets Do the Alphabet"" with Big Bird and Baby Bear as the hosts. I have over 18 S.S. videos/dvd's and only the 3 mentioned are worth watching and the money I paid for them. Please don't get me wrong, I love Sesame Street and I grew up with the S.S. addiction for most of my childhood-but The Childrens Workshop company is not the greatest at making videos."
1,Do NOT buy one......TRUST ME.,"This product is garbage. Kodak has really let us down with this camera. When it works it is a great camera. The pic quality is great, the movie function is pretty nice as well but something is inherently wrong w/ these cameras. I have returned mine 3 times and every single camera has had the same problem. There is something wrong w/ the power source/batteries. The camera when new will typically work well for the first couple of uses and then it will start to power off like the batteries are dead. YOu can test the batteries and they are fine. I just received my 3rd camera yesterday and it is doing the same exact thing that the other cameras were doing. 3 out of 3 cameras w/ the same problem obviously means that your chances of owning one without any problems is not good. If I could return it for a full refund I would but now I have had it too long. MY LOSS!!!"
2,Unimpressed,"Pictures from the Kodak are not quite up to scratch. At 'best' resolution, the prints are unimpressive and indoor shooting is almost a complete no-no on this camera. The lag on the shutter action is enough to ""lose a moment"", and the red-eye flash mode is a tad simplistic. On the plus side, the av-usb connector for a direct tv slide show is absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, the lack of an adapter/DC connection takes a heavy toll on battery life."
1,Dissapointed.,I bought this camera last December based on the reviews of some people here. What a mistake! 2.2 Megapixels is not enough for taking pictures indoors even in daylight. I had some pictures printed by OfotoNow and came back dull as ever. That was pictures measuring 6x4 and in the best resolution for the camera. Now I find it hard to believe 80 people have a problem with their eyes. Maybe some people are just easily satisfied. Now I am looking for a camera that takes pictures in as high a resolution as regular film cameras.
1,"Don't buy the box set, buy the Complete Collection Vol. 1 and 2 instead","I have nothing bad to say about Gundam Wing whatsoever. That said, I just wonder why the Box Set is $165?You can buy the entire series in two collections (Vol. 1 has episodes 1-25 and Vol. 2 has episodes 26-49) for a grand total of $80. Throw in Endless Waltz, and you've barely spent above $100.Having a clunky box set cost another 50 bucks more is just bad business."
1,What a bummer!,The package it came in was in good condition. When dealing with dvd items it's the disc itself that counts most. I previewed the dvds as soon as possible so I knew every disc worked properly. I discover that several of the dvd's inside were not able to show all the episodes.
1,Cynical viewer,Gundam Wing is only popular because of the drooling fangirl favorite bishonen are in it. This show however well animated and developed(that's sarcasm) is terribly dull and I couldn't watch more than five minutes of it when it was on television.This show is vastly overrated like a majority of the so called good anime. It's faults are overlooked due to the fact hat this show is anime it's suddenly considered good. No matter how weakly constructed the storyline or character development is.Sucn undeserving fanfare for such a piece of turd.
5,Wow...,"I started getting into the Gundam Universe when Gundam Wing first aired on Toonami on Cartoon Network. The show was very slick looking, and was probably better than anything on the network at the time. My brother and I found ourselves glued to the television everyday to see the next operation from this amazing series.Buying each individual DVD from the 10 that collect the 49 episodes is expensive. This box set really does save a good amount of time in searching, and in money for collecting all of the series. Tack on the Endless Waltz dvd in another order, and you pretty much have everything of this series in a great looking package."
3,One of my spring pans...didn't spring!,"After washing my pans, as I was attempting to put them back to together for use, I noticed that one of the pans screws didn't work and the snap was bent. I needed to complete my cheesecake Christmas gifts and I was unable to do so because of the faulty screws. Other than that, this would be a four."
5,one of my alltime favorites,"This record is so heartbreaking for me now, as it's still so brilliant, and reminds me of a near-perfect time in british guitar music, and also hints at what they could have become. ""Polar Bear"" and ""Dreams Burn Down"" are my favorites, but it's a rare record in that every song is a 10. Perfect for singing along, LOUDLY, on a rainy day. Perfect for air-drums and air-guitar. And the boys were absolutely beautiful."
4,What a different concept!,"As an avid reader, I seem to often find myself reading the same worn-out formulas, but just reading the overview of this novel told me I was in for a treat. I was not disappointed! The surreal becomes real and believable in this novel of love, hope and second chances. The more serious, underlying message in this novel could not be ignored. I read the last few lines with a smile and a renewed appreciation for life!! This is a book you will pass on to all your friends!"
2,This could have been a whole lot better,"I thought the premise of this book was interesting, but it turned out to be a little trite and with awfully large holes in the plot. I might be being stupid, but I expected a sort of metaphysical mystery, how to get Lauren back into her body ? It smacks of something that was written in order to be sold to Dreamworks and star Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But if you would like to spend a day reading a very undemanding book then this is for you. (I'm still confused, why did she go back?)"
1,Please disconnect the sugar!!,"Like many of the other reviewers, I got this book on tape (from the library, thank goodness!)because I thought the premise sounded interesting and fun. I knew it would be light and fluffy, and I don't mind that, but this thing gets so bogged down in stuffy, unrealistic dialogue and all this serious junk about Arthur's childhood. Personally, I think his mother sounded like a complete weirdo. His childhood stuff detracted from the main story, and, in my opinion, was completely unnecessary to the story. The conversations between Lauren and Arthur were just too soap-operaish. Nobody talks like that in real life! When Lauren ""disappeared"" from his apartment, I found myself telling Arthur to ""suck it up!"". I only listened all the way through so that I could find out the ending. Do yourself a favor, skip this book. There is so much better reading out there!!"
2,Oh no!,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I didn't love this book at all.Although its good qualities included being light, fluffy, and a quick and easy read, I think that's where it stopped for me.The transitions in the book were choppy, the premises all way too far-fetched, and the descriptions were lacking.It's a good book to read to escape for a little while (2 hours top) but it lacked substance for me."
5,Love this Bra!!!,"I absolutely love this bra,it's very comfortable great coverage & shoulder comfort at a great price.im going to order a couple more."
2,I would like it if it actually didn't fall apart...,"My fellow large-chested women know the drill: I'd like this if it didn't fall apart within half a dozen washes or less. This bra was not made for women with a large cup size. I'm a 40 G and I wore this maybe 3 times before it began to fall apart. Before that point, I really loved it and had high hopes for it. The construction of the cups and lace is part of what bothers me most. The lace in the cups began to rip and tear quite dramatically. I'm actually wearing it today (why, I have no idea--maybe because I haven't really been out much today) but I will probably throw it away soon because there will likely be nothing left to hold me up pretty soon.I really should've returned this bra but it may be too late at this point. I think this bra might be OK for women in a C cup or less. But even then it may not be sturdy enough."
2,Not Impressed,"It just fits weird. I thought it looked strange on the model in the white bra (see color selection photos) and assumed it was just that they had a full figure item on a not so full figure model. No, it actually fits this full figured (44H) woman like that. That extra bit of fabric on the underside does not seem to be part of the cup or the band and causes an odd lumpy look.The side panel fabric is way too flimsy to offer any side support.Also, the bottom elastic band somehow manages to fit snug in the back and loose in the front. How is that even possible? I mean snug and very loose. My engineer husband spent way too much time trying to figure this out last night."
2,Wow! -_-,"I think I would really like this bra if the seller decided to send me my correct size! They do make boobies a tad pointy, but I like the way it lifts! Good support."
2,Bra of the 50's,"I need a wire-free bra right now due to costochondritis. This definitely has the support, but turns the girls into a cone shape. It looked absurd under a shirt, so had to end it back."
4,Ahhh..,"Fits so well and is so very comfortable. Great lift without wires. (And this is Ron's wife)! hehehe I'm sure he likes it, too!"
4,breathtaking Moore,"I have always been a fan of Julianne Moore, but Safe showed me part of her that I'd never noticed before. She has a breathtaking ability to become a quiet woman, a still woman, a woman who goes unnoticed and who is afraid to speak. The static wide shots make one want to jump off the couch and peer closer to the television in an attempt to see who this woman really is. Haynes barely gives us the satisfaction of finding out, by the time the film is over, but we are left with the feeling we've just been told some kind of family secret. Love it, love it, love it."
2,Don't expect much quality . . .,"If you are looking for a terrific visual and audio experience, you can pass on this DVD. The soundtrack is pure mono, and the picture is average. If you really want to purchase this movie, get the VHS version, although that's not much of a bargain at $18. Better yet, rent it.The only reason I bought this movie (DVD) is because Jessica Harper is in it. She had two very small scenes. There are some other supporting roles that are nicely done and appealing.Yes, Julianne Moore's performance is extremely good. She literally looks weak and sick throughout the film, but makes some nice fashion statements. I don't know if this film is for or against environmental whackos, and it will a while before I watch it again.Sometimes you roll the dice on DVD's and that's what I did here. I really prefer a presentation with great sound and picture -- that's what DVD's are about!"
4,TERRIFIC,"Todd Haynes and Julianne Moore construct a great film. Its calculated pacing gives the story ample time to dissect the terror of modern day life. It not only examines the fear of a chemically saturated enviorment (car exhaust is poison, after all), but the upper class fear of fitting in (if I dont get a new Mercedes, I'll look like a fool) Julianne Moore's preformance is no less than brillaint. The movie wouldnt work without her. Todd Haynes shows he is a gifted director. He gives the viewer exacty what is needed and nothing more. For the person who swears they can see bacteria on a doorknob, and the person who's trying to keep up with the Jones's next door."
3,life is like a garden,"Well, I see that the Village Voice critics' poll has named this the best film of the nineties. Sheesh! Such adulation is, for my money, the most egregious example yet of postmodern critics' fascination with affectless, empty vessels into which they can impute meaning or significance, rather like the pols and businessmen in ""Being There"" who infer profundity from Chance the Gardener's guileness observations about gardening. The better first half of ""Safe"" succeeds reasonably well at evoking the sad protagonist's anomie and dread, but the film absolutely loses its way in the second section, is indeed as flat and static as Leonard Maltin suggests. (Hey, even Leonard Maltin gets it right once in a while.)"
3,Hodge Podge Collection From A Great Band,"True, not a great album, but if you dig Crimson at all and already have Lark's Tongues and the first album, it's worth getting just to hear ""Fracture"". It's truly evil. I also like ""The Night Watch"" and ""Trio"" (title cut is good too)."
4,Pretty Great Record,"The band loses Jamie Muir, and become a louder, more rock-oriented outfit. Bruford's playing was never better. He and Wetton are starting to play more muscularly, with the kind of volume that soon drove Cross out of the band.This album starts with two brilliant studio compositions that I can't say enough about. I sing them in the shower, frequently. The songs themselves are brilliant and the playing is frantic and perfect. The rest of Side 1 is a hodge-podge, kind of an odds-and-ends of material, much actually recorded live (though you can't necessarily tell from the sound).Side 2 has two tracks, one dispensible and one a brilliant composition worthy of the band's heritage (""Fractured""). These were also recorded live (the complete concert has been issued as ""The Night Watch"" - I recommend this LP instead though)."
5,life changing,"I am always struggling to become more organized and focused. I have MANY books on the subject. This book has done more for me in the last week than all the other books combined. The biggest impact is his genius idea of getting all that nagging ""stuff"" out of your mind and on to a ""next action list"". This is SO incredibly freeing!!!Once you have put that nagging item, whatever it is, onto a list that you KNOW you will deal with later - YOU ARE FREE! Thanks to the project folders, the 2 minute get it done idea and the horizontal and vertical thinking ......I truly feel forever changed. I was able to sort through 12 boxes of ""office #$%^%"" in about 2 hours thanks to this book. I fee like I've lost a 100 lbs!If you have stacks and stacks of paperwork that whenever you look through it you don't know where it should go - buy this book! It's a very simple, easy process........that works!"
5,AWESOME,"The Final Scene is a great game. The surroundings, music and story is wonderful, and the ending is a complete surprise. I recommend this game, as well as all of the other Nancy Drew games to anyone who enjoys a good mystery to keep them on their toes."
4,The Final Scene,"This game was exciting. I'm not really one for games that make me nervous and this one did. I was too much of a whimp to play it myself because it is so life like and makes you feel like you're actually in the game, but I watched my brother play it (he wanted to know why I didn't want to play it so he played it). It really was a good game."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This swing was a Christmas gift for my youngest daughter. It does not stay together. The seat pops off of the swing, and if the doll has any weight to it at all it doesn't swing. The fabric also comes off the frame. You are better off buying a real baby swing at a flea market or ebay. Very disappointed in this product. I would not give this product any stars but that is not an option. You have to select 1-5."
1,Swing kept falling off...,"I agree with the other reviews that stated that the swing kept falling apart. My daughter too, was dissapointed and frusterated at the swing wihthin hours of receiving in on Christmas morning. Every time she put her baby doll in it, the swing would fall off. We returned the swing to the store the next day. We also purchased and returned the highchair that matches this set. The food tray kept falling off. Highly dissapointed."
2,Falls apart too easily,Swing is a lot cheaper than it looks. It doesn't hold an 18 inch baby doll very well - more suited for a 12 inch doll. The swing won't stay together. The part that holds the baby comes off from the swing every time my 2 yr old daughter puts her baby in it. I paid a little more for this swing thinking I was paying for quality... but save your money it's not as nice as it looks.
5,Love it!,"I gave my daughter the 3-1 Swing for her 4th Birthday. She absolutely loves it. She is able to carry it around from one room to the next. It was easy to put together. The only problem that I have with this swing, is that it does not hold heavier dolls very well. But other than that I would purchase this item again. I am buying the Ocean Wonders high chair for her for Christmas."
4,Well done.,"This book teaches social skills which although American, are quite applicable to other cultures (such as Canadian).For example:1. There is much to be said for making a good first impression, however people are generally forgiving and tend to takethe long view in their interactions. By this I mean that Mr. Giblin underestimates the patience Americans havewhen dealing with others.2. There is too much emphasis on technique, and not enough on the Judeo-Christian concept of intent. Most peoplecan stumble through a job interview even if they are not that slick; meaning their sincerity shines through.In conclusion, despite my tendency to focus on the negative (like any reviewer), I think this book is quitevaluable, and worth having on your bookshelf."
4,"A little bit of theory; practical ""how-to"" advice",This book is written in everyday language and helps non-management people understand why others act as they do. A lot of practical information on how to influence others through routine application of basic principles. This book is also a good review for professional managers who may have lost touch with the human relations side of their jobs. Also useful for professional managers who need to train new/inexperienced managers.
2,Ok. But no charm.,"Lorna is pretty, and her suitor is devoted. The story holds your attention. For many that is enough. Some auspicious beginnings, without depth. So maybe 3-stars for some people. I give 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again in later years.I found the romance unfulfilling, and so the movie. Romance movies that I liked better are: ""North & South"", ""Pride & Prejudice""-1940, & 1996 & 2006, ""Wives and Daughters"", and ""A Walk to Remember"". Adventure with romance: ""The Scarlet Pimpernel""."
2,Not the quality expected,"This production is lacking good casting, the acting by the lead characters is woefully inadequate. However the supporting cast is very good,"
4,As Advertised,"Worked as advertised. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out if it was the right product. There were conflicting reviews and specs. But, it ended up being the right one for my door opener, and has worked fine. Easy installation and programming. Even a cave man can do it ..."
1,WHAT A RIPOFF!!,"RECEIVED THIS ON 3/18/10 AND NOW JUST HOOKING IT UP AND THIS UNIT ONLY WORKS WITH AN OPENER 2005 OR OLDER. THEY DON'T PUT THAT IN THERE ADVERTISEMENT!! SOLD BUY ""HHWHOLESALE"" I GUESS THEY GOT MY 20 BUCKS, ISN'T WORTH THE SHIPPING TO SEND IT BACK. WILL NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN."
2,No staying power - early demise,I used this remote for two years with another brand lifter and then replaced my lifter with a Chamberline model. All was well for about 6 months and then the remote stopped working. Tried everything but concluded that this model just couldn't stand up to Georgia summers. Too bad.Same as Chamberline 976LM
1,DID NOT WORK,"I tried everything to get it to work, did nothing. I went out and bought one from MFG and it works fine."
5,Great Replacement Keypad,Easily replaces the original keypad that had worn over 10 years use. New keypad fit quickly on original screws; no change in size or style. Programmed in a minute from the wall pad. Can also be progreammed from the ceiling-mounted garage door opener.
4,Installed easily and works.,"I worried about getting this, but it installed in minutes and worked within a few minutes more. We've had it for several months now and no problems."
5,I can't believe how easy!,This item installed unbelievably easy. From unboxing to installed and functional in 15 minutes or less. Very satisfied with this product!
5,installed it today works great.,can only say that my old keypad would not work in cold temps. installed this one today at 35 degrees and it works great. Sears store wants about $43 including tax. I returned it as Amazon cost me $33 including shipping and everythng.Thank you Amazon
3,Unsupported on most mac internal drives,Unlike what is suggested in the features ---- this is not properly supported for mac machines!!!THIS IS MAINLY DOWN TO THE SIMPLE FACT THAT VIRTUALLY ALL MACSHAVE EITHER DRAWER OR SLOT LOADING CD DRIVES AND THE MINI CDFORMAT NEEDS TO BE SPINDLE LOADED - LOADING A MINI CD INTO A SLOTOR DRAWER LOADING DRIVE IS LIKELY TO DAMAGE THE DRIVE!!!!PS. this will also affect VIRTUALLY ALL Desktop PC DrivesHaving said that should be good for those with spindle loading cd drivesnew iBook and most PC laptops or those with external drives designed for laptops
4,Good book on the best bass palyer in Rock!! But not perfect.,"THis is the best bass tab book of Geddy Lee's amazing playing available, because unfortunately due to the short sightedness of publishers it is the only one available.It could be perfect except for two slight problems- One- as commented previously some of the positions are wrong. Not only are they wrong, but this book tabs everything as if Geddy plays a TON of open strings. I can tell you after seeing him live several times (and playing most of his lines myself) he does not play everything in the first position using open strings. A lot of his lines are playing in the 5th position in D Major and mixolydian.The other slight problem is this has a lot of songs that just aren't Geddy's best bass playing like Cold Fire, And Dreamline.I heard there is possibly a long overdue Volume 2 of Rush Bass lines coming but until that time, this remains your best (and only) bet."
3,"Easier to read, dated edition","Good book, it has one of the most welcoming approaches to the subject you can get from a text book, but I'd still advise you to buy the newer edition."
4,How cute,"I bought this set for my daughter for christmas and she is going to love it. We put it together before christmas and just wrapped it like that, that way your not struggling as she is getting impatient. You do have to be careful and really follow directions, and sometimes the little pop pins can get stuck inside but just take a tiny screw driver and pop them back out. This toy will be a huge success. For a doll toy there are a lot of options and it is pretty well made."
1,Fisher Price Ocean Wonder Set,"I purchased the whole Ocean Wonder Set for my grand children and was very upset Christmas Eve when I tried to assemble them and could not make them snap together, or to stay together. The cloth coverings were too small and would not fit on. My Christmas present was a big disappointment to my family. I was even more disappointed in the product and could not believe that Fisher Price marketed such cheap quality products. I have always purchased Fisher Price but will not trust their name again."
2,Revisionist History,"While this book is certainly a must read for diehard Kaufman fans (myself included), as it offers a few tidbits on Andy not found elsewhere, it serves mostly as a vehicle for Zmuda to attempt to overcome his feeling slighted at not receiving enough credit for Kaufman's work. Apparently, Zmuda was the brainchild behind most of Kaufman's schemes. I don't doubt that Zmuda was an important person in Andy's life and collaborated with Andy, yet Zmuda makes it known that Andy wouldn't be anything without him--an idea I find ludicrous.A better book is Bill Zehme's biography of Kaufman, Lost in the Funhouse, which seems more even handed in its treatment of Zmuda's and Kaufman's collaboration.So, read Zmuda if you must, but know that Zmuda's book is of firstmost importance to Zmuda himself."
5,Zmuda draws back the curtain,"Thank you Mr. Zmuda for allowing us to see the real Andy Kaufman. A complex and personally tortured man who was the antithesis of his on-screen persona. Andy's secret should have been revealed years ago, allowing the public to understand his genius and true caring nature.The book, while glossing over some events, allowed the public to finally see who Andy really was, and will allow the public to re-evaluate Andy's character and place in entertainment history.It is truly tragic that it has taken so long to understand and honor this man. Thanks again Mr. Zmuda for letting us in.P.S. Mr. Zmuda - I must speak for all who read this book. Please spearhead an effort to bring together the stories of all those who worked for and with Mr. X. for publishing. His story could possibly be one of the greatest ever told. Plus, Andy (wherever he is), might just pick up a copy."
4,great tribute to a comic genious,"I never understood why Andy Kaufman was so quickly forgotten after his tragically early death.Maybe because nobody could believe it!(I keep hoping that Andy will turn up at the preview of the ""man in the Moon"" movie disguised as Tony Clifton!)I'm glad that he is being rediscovered through the movie,and 2 new books about him.(What are the odds that 2 guys with the initials B.Z.would come out with books on Andy at the same exact time?Weird,man!)I preferred Bob Zmuda's book because he was such a close friend and collaborator of Andy's.He reveals many previously unknown details behind Andy's comedy.All in all,a worthy read for the Andy Kaufman fan."
2,Where's Andy?,"This book is less about Andy Kaufman than about Bob Zmuda and his reactions to Andy Kaufman. Zmuda includes bits of his personal history that we really didn't need to know (i.e. what Mr. X did in line at the donut shop)and he just tries way too hard. Hindsight is 20/20 vision, and maybe Andy Kaufman really was just this sweet shy guy inside. Or maybe that's just Zmuda trying to hand us a pair of rose-colored glasses. Try Lost in the Funhouse by Zehme for a better picture of Andy himself."
2,More of Zmuda's Bio than Andy's,"This book is more of Bob Zmuda's autobiography than Andy's biography. Throughout the book, Zmuda talks about his life more than Andy's. He also tries to take credit for almost everything Andy Kaufman ever did. ""This was my idea, and this was my idea."" If you are a fan of Andy, don't get this book, it is just Zmuda trying to get some fame off of Andy's good name. If you really want a wonderful biography of Andy, read ""Lost in the Funhouse."""
4,1975 release also quad release,"i bought this album when it 1st was release...also...the quad L.p. and the quad 8 track...the quad 8 track...blew away the stereo mix's by far,.....i believe if all elvis fans had a quad system back in 1975this would have been a multi platinum disc."
5,Best dramatization possible... (in my opinion),"This film succeeds as an unbiased, well-crafted and unflinching portrait of an American ""sociopath"" (someone completely disconnected emotionally from others). Just as his life and crimes are portrayed as they occurred, without any attempt at manipulating the audience, his execution is equally blunt, allowing the viewers to see the brutality of the death penalty alongside the savage violence of the man being executed. I have found this film to be the most powerful indictment of the death penalty (and most sympathetic treatment of a serial killer)of any I have seen. I recommend the film highly to any seeking a well made, startling and painfully honest film about a man with a compulsion to destroy....-Joseph ""God"" Jordan"
3,"Not perfect, but better than average","There have been a lot of biographies & movies about Bundy & I've seen them all. This one does not cover every aspect of his life, but it does hit on the most pivotal & key moments. While the details are embellished somewhat to make for a more interesting movie, for the most part it is quite accurate. I think what is most intrigueing, however, is the actor who portrays Bundy, Michael Reilly Burke; he is frightening, and thoroughly makes the movie worth watching. Not only does he look very much like Bundy & emulate his characteristics well, but his acting is impressive, and gives us an entirely believable look at the monster side of Bundy the public barely saw in real life. Anyone intested in serial killer bios/movies, this one is worthy of watching. It has its scary moments."
1,Caution - possibly dangerous crackpot,Kervran was a leading member of 'Rentacrank'; that thankfully small group of incompetent scientists who take their ludicrous ideas straight to the newspapers or 'into print'. Anybody who reads this book is wasting their time. I am giving this book one star only because the software censors anything less.
1,This gate is on the kids' side!,"The Evenflo SimpleEffort Plus gate is quick to install with or without the included extensions, sports an attractive color, boasts a clever hands-free design, and I would absolutely award it 5 stars...IF IT WORKED!To make a long story short, this diabolical item self-activates and swings open every 5-15 minutes. My son waits to hear the loud ""click"" and crawls to freedom. You'll notice I'm not the only reviewer to cite this problem. (Note: my gate is not installed near a microwave, which I understand might cause electrical interference.) Oh, and the motion-sensing night light doesn't function at all.You should also know that batteries are not included. It requires 4 C batteries & 1 9V, which add to the overall cost.I own several other Evenflo gates, all of which I would absolutely recommend. Unfortunately, faulty engineering makes this model a dud.Kudos to Amazon for making it easy to return!!"
2,This is a Kid's Game??,"This game was a little too hard for my tastes. Despite the fact that I played at the junior level I managed to get killed shortly after starting out. I also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once I left the room I couldn't find my way back (all the corridors look alike). So far I've fallen down an elevator shaft, gotten caught breaking and entering, been crushed by an elevator, frozen to death and been hit over the head...I've got to ask is this really appropriate for children?"
4,"Nancy Drew: TRT, by HerInteractive","This was a very good game. It was an improvement since the first game, ""Secrets Can Kill"", also by HerInteractive. This game was challenging and fun, and can be played numerous times. Everytime you play, you can find something new that you never noticed before. I'm glad I bought this game."
4,Exellent Game,I was pleased with this product.The only problem is it was alittle to easy.None the less an entertaning game.This would come in second behind MITHH as the best Drew games.I recomend this to all lovers of Mystery.
5,Great Mystery!,Out of the four Nancy Drews I think this was the best! I spent 1 whole day playing!! It was so exciting and hard. I loved it.
5,So many secrets,"I think the Nancy Drew computer games are the best computer games I've ever played. One of my favorites is Treasure in a Royal Tower. There are so many secret passageways and hidden messages to find but they are not as challenging to find as you think! An elevator gets stuck here, an alarm goes off there, but they are all hidden clues to help you solve the mystery of the vandalized library and the sealed off tower."
5,My Favorite Game ! !,"This was my favorite game of all the Nancy Drew games. It had a lot of places to explore. In this game, unlike some of the other ones, you get to go outside. My favorite place to explore is the elevator shaft. My favorite puzzle is the leaves. The only thing I don't like is you always have to unlock your own door. This was by far the best game. I wish I could give more than five stars!"
4,It actually deserves 4 1/2 stars!,This was one of my favorite Nancy Drew games (and I only have 2 favorites)! This one wasn't extremely hard but that's kind of good because then it doesn't frustrate you. This one was relatively easy and it was very interesting learning about Marie Antoinette (not sure if I spelled that right). You also get to stay in a castle. All the features of these Nancy Drew games are remarkable. You can talk to characters and explore many different rooms. You have to come up with several ways to get something you want or need. It's very fun and it has great graphics. You should definitely buy THIS game if you're going to buy one at all (which I suggest you do).
5,One of the best ND games,"When Nancy gets trapped in a ski resort castle because of a snowstorm, she sees that some accidents have been happening in the house, such as a vandalized libary and guests complaining of thiefs. Nancy finds out that what this person is after is Marie Antoinette's legendary treasure! In this game you might get really stuck- I think there are 5 ways to get kicked out of the game. Here is my top hint- sometimes you will get stuck, but you won't be able to use second chance. In this case, don't panic. There will be a way out of every situation! This was one of the best games in the series. I reccomend that you buy it!"
5,Great!,"My son, 18 months, loves the monster truck dvds. We have all three volumes and he can't get enough of them!Cute animation, great stories, finally something for a little boy to identify with - trucks!"
5,The only seat reducer to work well for Toto elongated toilets!,"I found that with the Toto elongated toilets, the other seat reducers I tried slipped around quite a bit. This one at least stays put pretty well because the rubber keeps it from moving. Note that using the pegs is not even an option with the seat on this type of toilet because it is very concaved and the pegs would not be able to reach to the bottom side of it. But like others have said, the pegs are not really necessary due to the rubber included in the design."
5,AMAZING!,"This toilet seat is awesome! My son potty trained at just over 2 years old and it only took about 10 days. We loved this seat for several reasons. It's very easy to clean with no grooves or folds for urine to get trapped it. The seat tilts forward a bit which helps to keep everything going in the right direction (important with little boys). The seat was comfortable for our son to sit on for a while when he was training. It was portable, which helped in the early phases of toilet training. And it was very easy for him to transition from using the seat reducer to sitting on a regular toilet seat. We have a round toilet seat and the reducer fit on it with no problems and the rubber around the outside prevented the seat from moving. I have recomended the PRIMO Ducka to several friends, it was worth every penny!"
4,Cool!,"I could not open the iPod nano using only the tools that came with the kit, but with the help of a tip scissors(and using the tools in the kit TOO), I can open the iPod without damaging it. Now we need to change to get a soldering iron to replace the battery. Taught others how to replace without soldering iron. If I can borrow one, I'll do this as they spoke. The important thing is that for a small charge my iPod nano (First Generation) will return to work again!"
4,"Not an Imposter, just the original.","No it's not an imposter, just the original version of the book, stills with narration. If you want the real thing make sure to get the 1966 version with Boris Karloff doing the Grinch and narration. I enjoy both versions very much and have both versions on tape although the Boris Karloff is by far my favorite. Merry Grinchmas!"
2,Not what I wanted!!,"I was in a big hurry when I ordered this and didn't read the reviews--I'll never make that mistake again! THIS IS NOT THE VERSION YOU KNOW AND LOVE FROM TV. It is just a reading of the book, with the original illustrations, and is much less fun-- the Grinch is meaner, there are none of the hysterical interactions with his poor dog and there's NO MUSIC. What a disappointment."
1,BEWARE! NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT,"THIS VIDEO IS NOT THE ONE SHOWN ON TELEVISION. THERE ARE TWO COPYS OF ""HOW GRINCH THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS"" IF YOU WANT THE ONE WITH SONGS AND COLOR DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!"
1,It's just not the same!,I made the same mistake. I thought this was the one I always saw on TV every year when I was a kid. It's definitely not! Just pictures with narration. Look closely before you buy!!!!
5,Alexander O'Neal,This album from Alex is a great one. I only wish that we could get more music from him. This one is definitely worth the minimal amount I paid on Amazon for it.
5,To Sail Beyond the Sunset,One of Heinlein's best. He intersting weaves in social commentary while masterfully telling a good tale. Maureen is as sexy as they come.
4,Schizophrenic soup,"Influence from both protopunk band, the Velvet Underground and minimalist composer, LaMonte Young, is apparent on sonic experimentalist, Brian Eno's 1973 solo debut, Here Come the Warm Jets. The album is a schizophrenic soup of the avant-garde. Sometimes blistering hard rock centered around layers of distorted guitars bursts out (""Blank Frank,"" ""Needles in the Camel's Eye""), sometimes an achingly, beautiful composition erupts (""On Some Faraway Beach,"" the title track) and sometimes a quirky, glamrock oddity is provided (""Dead Finks Don't Talk"" ""The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch,"" a song about a sex toy featuring a hilarious, squeaking, mechanical keyboard solo). No matter where he wanders, Brian Eno does little wrong on this album. Few musicians can pool so many extremes and oddities into such an infectious, cohesive mix as well as Eno."
3,New York displaced,"Perhaps on the CD version it is harder to discern the connection between the artwork and title, but remembering the vinyl version I get it. Let's leave it at that. With this in mind I can't help drawing parallels between this album and Andy Warhol's Velvet underground with Nico. If you like that lo-fi pop played with a certain confidence, this might be for you. For my part, I bought this for the infectious riff of the title track then found the rest didn't quite hold my interest. It's not because it's bad, rather it just doesn't sync with my taste."
4,thomas the tank engine in space,Excession is Iain M Bank's train set in his attic doing all the cool things he ever wanted it to do. In the final analysis it must be Thomas the tank engine in space- cos all the ships have their own personalitities and go about doing stuff they want to do - not necessarily what the humans want them to do. But in my analogy who is the fat controller. Hmm. I think we might be waiting a while to find that one out. LONG LIVE THE CULTURE!!
3,Disappointing ending,"I admit I haven't read prior Culture books. So the sheer scale of the inventiveness of the author sped me through the first half. But then the main threads become somewhat obvious and I've expected the plot convolute again closer to the end (expect the unexpected ;) but unfortunately, besides some hierarchical irregularities and military oddities, all storylines become rather linear and ended up in rather logical and predictable way.Also, every sentient being in the book is very human-like. Just dialed this or that way a bit."
4,"Not his best work, but enjoyable.","The previous reviewers got it right, a good book, but not Bank's best work. It lacked the sad grit that makes Banks different than the rest. I had thought it would be nice if he ended on a high note, but I was wrong. I found it well worth the time to read, and I think it was a good book by all accounts. Don't let us fans put you off because we feel that he hasn't done his best, his worst is better than most"
3,"Fascinating, but slow","This is an inventive novel describing a far future of autonomous AIs that inhabit their own spaceships, create vast virtual reality simulations, and also engage in intriguing conversations and political machinations with other AIs. Unfortunately, the plot moves at a snail's pace. What makes the book worth reading, however, is the fascinating comparison between the humans who are still around and the ubiquitous artificial superintelligences. (There are also some not so cuddly aliens thrown in for contrast and for comic relief.) Some readers may find themselves wishing that the machines and humans could meld, keeping the best of both and getting rid of the rest. That, of course, is one of the great challenges facing us in this new century and this novel can stimulate our thinking and discourse."
2,TEDIOUS,"There are whole pages in this book containing sentence fragments burried in random computer gibberish like this: //8367309//!2384#@459003000. I got the point the first time Mr. Banks--YES THESE ARE COMPUTERS TALKING TO EACH OTHER! I get it already, so drop the silly gimmick. Unfortutely, the author seems to have forgotten his audience is...HUMAN. The only reason I didn't give ""Excession"" a 1 is because it contained some cool ideas about dual hyperspace planes I havn't encountered before. Forget ""Excession"" and read Peter F. Hamilton's ""The Reality Dysfunction"" series. It delivers."
3,Timex Runner's/Walking/Jogging Watch,Actually an honest rating is more like somewhere between 3 and 4 stars like a 3.5 stars....decent quality and good value and it was easy to order and fairly quick in the mailing. For a cheap runner's/jogging/walking watch it is a good deal and again decent quality and value...my guess is that it should last two to three years.
3,An excercise book with the emphasis on Jazz,"This isn't really a method book; the subtitle, ""Essential Scales, Patterns and Excercises"" describes it better. As an adjunct to other study material it's useful, but as a jazz method it's a bit lacking. There's no discussion whatsoever, and nothing that really connects to the style of Ray Brown. For that matter, much of the material recapitulates excercices found in Simandl and other bass methods.Bass players looking to develop some jazz chops should look at Bob Magnusson's ""The Art of Walking Bass"", Ron Carter's ""Building Jazz Bass Lines"" and Ed Friedland's ""Building Walking Bass Lines"", among others. The Ray Brown book might serve as a collection of etudes to practice along with these books."
3,only so-so,I got this sling before I took my 6 week old on an airplane and it totally saved us! He fell asleep instantly and slept the whole flight (3 hours) He usually sleeps the whole time he's in it.But what I don't like is the way he fits in it. The crotch strap is more in the way than helpful. It holds him too high up so his head isn't in it right. I honestly like it better if I don't use the strap. And it does hurt my shoulder. After an hour or so I have to switch sides. Other than that it's a nice product.
4,A little different; thoughtful; still a good album,"This is quite an interesting album with a lot of thoughtful tracks, mostly fairly mellow. There are not a lot of rockers (Calling all Stations, The Dividing Line, Small Talk, and maybe Congo) and the tone is different to previous Genesis albums, but if you listen with an open mind (not expecting the same thing as before) you may enjoy it.I've listened to it a fair amount and enjoy it each time, finding new things to appreciate; recently I realised that ""Uncertain Weather"" seems to be talking about Hiroshima. And to me they are still following their ""art rock"" roots. Alien Afternoon is a surreal song...For reference I also liked the 80's (Gensis, Invisible Touch) and 70's (Trick of the Tail) Genesis. I would probably agree it is not one of the greatest albums of all time, lacking standout tracks or real virtuoso playing, and perhaps a little overproduced, but neither is it a bad one."
3,3 and a half stars,"It's a shame that this, the last Genesis CD, didn't get more of a chance. It's certainly not their best work by far, but is as good or better than anything after DUKE. Some songs seem to lack proper endings and some seem a little underdeveloped, but the material is generally strong. Ray Wilson does a fine job on vocals and ""One Man's Fool"" is a classic Genesis track."
4,"PHIL, PLEASE COME BACK","Ok, i am a diehard GENESIS fan, whatever ever they do, however they grow, i can take it, pre-Collins Genesis & post-Collins alike. I am more disapointed that Genesis called it quits after this than i am that phil left. I LOVED PHIL IN GENESIS, but Ray Wilson is ok, i guess they figured that support in England meant nothing if they didn't have America, so they quit. When Peter left, they said, ""we are still good, let's continue"" but i guess now they've got enough money so they don't have to go on, a shame. Now as for the songs, Wilson's voice is good, and so are the drums. The best songs to me are the title track, Dividing Line, Not About Us, (the Hold On My Heart copy:) If That's What You Need, Congo,Shipwrecked and Small Talk (despite it's annoying parts) I guess if Genesis won't carry on with Ray Wilson, will Phil please come back?also receommended:Genesis: We Can't DanceGenesis: Seconds Out (almost a ""hits live"" at that point)Genesis: Lamb Lies Down On BroadwayGenesis: Live"
2,Calling Where?,"For Genesis, trying to press on without Phil Collins was a complete disaster. When you have a incredible singer at the top of his game, replacing him can be a very difficult gesture. In this case, it became a complete bomb. When Ray Wilson stepped in to Phil Collins' shoes, it became a lot more difficult then it seemed to be, and it was ever just as hard.The 1997 album, Calling All Stations, was the first Genesis collection, without Phil Collins in the spotlight. Although the album has had one credible song, Congo, which remains as the only song worth listening to, the rest of the album was a flop. Unfortunately, it was the final album Genesis made in their entire career.Although Genesis reunited for the Turn It On Again Greatest Hits collection in 1999, many people are still hoping that Phil Collins, Mike Ruterford, and Tony Banks can make great music someday. Instead of getting this album, I suggest you buy We Can't Dance, or Invisible Touch over this anyway you can."
4,A long overdue return to art rock...,"The last few Genesis albums featuring Phil Collins were a tad confused if one remembers the better output of the band in the seventies and early eighties.On this record,Genesis have left all that behind,bringing in a new vocalist reminiscent of Peter Gabriel and a very welcome change of pace,showing that their best days are not over."
1,Earplugs Please......,"Ok, well, I had been a Genesis fan since the 70's. I am one of those that was a major Phil Collins fan, yet didn't feel that Phil Collins WAS Genesis. I still don't. Tony Banks can sing. Mike Rutherford can sing. They don't have hard rock voices, but they can sing. They didn't need Ray Wilson. I have not heard the entire album. All I had to hear was the Wilson live version of ""Turn It On Again"" to turn it off and never turn it on ever again. Ray Wilson's vocals are so horible, why would anyone want to listen to this. No wonder it was the demise of Genesis. I don't think that they need to bring Phil back per se... just have faith in themselves and do it. Bring in someone from the Prog rock days maybe. Until then, I can't bare to listen to this Wilson Genesis again. Sorry."
2,"""Lower Your Expectations""","I am 55 yrs. old, work out at home, and attend a weekly Pilates class. I think I am moderately ""fit"". I had hoped this tape would provide a good at-home workout. I chose this after reading the various reviews for this tape and Kathy Smith's ""Abs Workout"", and assumed this would be more challenging. Unfortunately this tape is not much more than a beginner's workout, failing to adequately address the lower body, and was a real waste of money. To describe this as a ""Lower Body"" tape, is simply misleading.I have been a long term fan of Kathy Smith. I have recommended her Shaper Ball and Aerobic Boxing tapes to friends. I enjoy her style of instruction and the production values. However, this workout simply does not deliver what it promised."
3,Could be better,I usually love Kathy's workouts but this one was a disappointment though I liked it better than her Pilates for Abs DVD. There are better Pilates DVDs out there. (Try Jennifer Kries Pilates Method for a true workout!) This one could have been combined with her equally short Pilates for the Abs.
2,battery killer,kill my ultra batt with like 15teen to 20 pictures.! takes three flashes before any shot. the only way it can flash only once you have to be outside in the sun but then who needs a flash? I should have spent more and bought a better camera
3,"This is ok, but","Since I wanted a ceiling hugger fan, I bought this kit. I was surprised that there was no mention of how to install the remote receiver. I ended up cramming in in, and it works, but would have appreciated some mention of how to!"
3,if you like old fashioned ballet....,"Pierre Lacotte calls himself the ""arqueologist of ballet"", and I think it's an accurate definition of his work.""Paquita""(as a suite of dances) is one of the most popular ballets in the classical repertoire, with it's spanish-styled music, pyrotechnical pas de deux and variations, specially suited for small companies or ballet schools, (16 girls and 1 boy!) good male dancers are hard so to find.....Lacotte took the so-called Paquita suite, recontructed a whole first act, and added the half of the second act, but he did it as if we were still in 1887! The coreography is so a-terre and old fashioned, it's just boring.The whole production is gorgeous, stunning costumes and sets,paris opera has the best corps of the world,soloists and etoiles are first class, it's a shame the dances could be more interesting."
5,Inspriational!,Fantastic book. Finally someone has written a financial book for the average person. The authors are so inviting and genuine - I read the book in one sitting! I was inspired to follow their clear ideas and make a positive financial change in my life!
2,Complete Your Lucero Collection ONLY,"First things first - I really dig Lucero.At first I was just plain mad that I paid retail price for this. Then I said ""The Attic Tapes should have stayed in the attic!"" But let's get down to what is really here and not my feelings. Most of the songs here sound like solo acoustic demos and these demos are not that exciting. Just the basics. The last 2 songs on the cd are from the band and I like them the most. Hey, if they would have handed this cd out at a show my reaction would have been different. I recommend this cd if you just want to mellow out to a guy singing w/ his geetar (a few beers would help) or if you just have to have a Lucero fix."
1,i wonder,i wonder why this game works for some but in most cases does not. it just freezes up after clicking on the fly icon. very disappointing
5,If only more albums were of this quality.......,"This is the tightest, most mind-bending KC album that I've heard--Fripp's riff's rock and the rhythm section anchors it all excitingly & effectively. To say nothing of the sophisticated violin squeeks that add yet another layer of depth. And the idiosyncratic hippie-dippie lyrics of Peter Sinfield are gone here too, successfully inaugerating the band into the rueful and paranoid Nixon-era."
2,not her best,"I love reading true crime by Ann Rule and I have several of her books. This was not my favorite.. I've had a hard time staying interested in this one. Normally I cant put the book down and read it within a few days, but this one I am halfway through and cant seem to stay with it. Her stuff is usually very enthralling but I wouldnt rate this as her best."
2,Could have been a better story.,"Let me start of by saying ""I am an Ann Rule Fan Club Member."" But this book would have been a better book had someone else written the story. For such a dramatic and action packed drama, little of those emotions came through in this story. What bothered me most about this book was the incredible amount of information that I had to wade through to get to the real story. Certain parts of the book go on and on about events from character's lives who are not a significant part of the story. I'm no expert, but I believe if a good editor would have gone through the book and cut out all of which wasn't necessary to the story then it would have been a better book. I can normally read a good true crime book in 1-5 days, but this one took me forever and I found myself skipping pages. And I hate to skip pages in a book I paid good money for."
4,Good if you like true crime,I enjoyed the book but it seemed it took forever to bring it to a conclusion. I really enjoy all of Ann Rule's books
2,Too much detail?,"Saturday, August 13, 2011I really admire Ann Rule for all the work she puts into her books. Imagine how many interviews she must conduct. I have to admit that her books are often a bit tedious, as in this book. There really is too much repetition about how awful the bad guy is. But hey, it's well worth reading."
2,Good coffee but bad workmanship,"The machine is easy to use and makes great espresso ... when it's working!Mine broke down within the first year. I spent $80 dollars to fix it the first time, but it broke down again after another two months of use (water wouldn't heat up). It would cost me another $200 to fix it. I'm now looking for a more reliable machine."
4,Saeco Vienna Deluxe,"Makes a great cup. My husband can even use it. I did have to send away for a DVD instruction manual since it comes standard with a VHS(who still has VHS??) Easy to use. The only thing I would have expected stainless, not plastic for the price. Under normal use, this should be a great little machine. I even took it to work for a Latte party."
5,best value,"I did extensive research before purchasing this automatico. I am going on 3 months now. The machine makes about 10-12 cups of coffee or espresso a day. So far it is outstanding! I do wish the water was just slightly warmer, however as long as you heat your cup first with hot water from sink or the machine the coffee will be very hot. Cleaning is a breeze. I just empty the spent coffee and the waste water at the end of the day. In the morning I add fresh filtered water from the refrigerator. Once a week I take out the internal brewing gizmo (simple) and rinse it in hot water. I enjoy espressos frequently. We make 2 different types of coffee. I drink cafe americano. It is just 1 shot of espresso with hot water added. it is a velvety cup of coffee. My wife like the cafe crema which is just a 7 or 8 oz espresso. The machine always produces a beautiful crema! I highly recomend this machine for the great value."
1,"I had 12 of them, so far, three were dead.","I am in coffee business. Last month, I ordered 12 saeco cafe cremawhich is the same of Vienna Deluxe. I found several machinehad the problem on case installation, the problem wasthey didn't insert the inner board correctly, so the lefttop case did not fit to the lower case. That's easy to fix.But now three of them could not be turned on. I checked mostparts inside, looked OK. The only problem could be the controlboard behide the control pannel. I have not decided to contactSaeco or not, since it takes three months to get parts.It's a good espresso machine, but make sure you need toget easy access to the service center before you buying it."
3,Great! Buy it from Amazon and buy the warranty.,I bought this after much looking around. Did a ton of research. I saw that some people had problems so I decided to buy the warranty. So simple and such a perfect result. It is like having a beer tap in your house. But for coffee. No more Starbucks! BUTit broke in one week! Just wouldn't turn on. Checked everything called the manufacture. Just stopped. So I went online and requested a return and had my new one in two days! Amazon was amazing. I am so glad I bought it through them!
5,Delightful,"A truely funny woman, but her story is amazingly insightful as well. gave it as gifts, bought her next book."
4,breaking down barriers,"As a child of immigrant parents and a mother of 3 U.S. born children, I could relate to Firoozeh Dumas' experiences in both capacities, as child and parent. As I was growing up in Downey/Pico Rivera, about 5 miles away from Whittier,California I shared almost the identical issues she faced and swore, ""I'm going to be a hip parent when i grow up."" But I found, as we grow, our natural instinct as parents to protect and nurture our children overtake the whole idea of trying to be cool. In most cases, we try to retain the cultures and practices of our homeland to instill in them the important values as part of their identity. This book serves as the perfect reminder to immigrant parents of things Not To Do regardless of ""meaning well"". It breaks down the barriers not just between the middle east and the wild west by sharing our commonalities, but between the generation gap between parent and child in a fashion that carries a bigger message, be proud of who you are."
3,Farsi,"This is ok, but I think it's aimed at a younger audience. I doubt that I would recommend it to my bookclub."
4,"Being ""The Other"" in the U.S.","I recently read _Funny in Farsi_ and this weekend heard Mrs. Dumas speak in Maryland. (Hello to Kazem! You have a wonderfully witty and engaging daughter. You should be very proud.)Ms. Dumas is a fine speaker and shed even more light on aspects her book hints at concerning growing up in a stange land and being an outsider.I was especially impressed with her desire to put herself out there to give us Americans a positive image of a Middle Eastern person.Her book is hysterically funny, a very easy read, and very enlightening as you recognize aspects of your own self and family, in her descriptions of her own family. She reveals the universal truth that we all either have been or will be outsiders at some point in our lives."
5,THE SERIES GETS BETTER AND BETTER!!!,The Mediator: Reunion was the best written so far! I loved all of the twists and turns in this story! Absolutly keep reading The Mediator series!!!!!!
5,"Hilarious, full of suspense, thoroughly enjoyable","After reading this book I went in search of the author's other works only to discover that nothing else was available! The author has masterful control over the pace at which things happen and over the intensity in which they occur. I was relaxed one moment, completely off balance the next. The characters are very real as they make the same strange decisions we all make ... the plot is entertaining and what about scraping the meat? Read the book"
2,a poor selection,"a poor selection of Millay's poems, many of the same sort of lover's complaint... if that's what you want to read of hers, then its great... but if not, then not."
4,"Strong music, weak vocals","Great music! A little weak on the lyrics/vocals, but that's not why I listen to the guy anyway."
4,Killer product!,"If you're looking to add a 'stealth' look to your rig, these smoked clearance lights are a must. Even though I did have a little difficulty screwing the soft rubber bulb holders back in their sockets once I had spliced them in to my truck's wiring...the kit is relatively easy to install. Don't expect, (as I did), to just remove the bulb sockets from your stock clearance lights and screw them into the ReCon set...it won't happen. That then makes it necessary to cut your old lights off and splice the new ones in. Basically, what I'm saying here is don't expect a ""direct fit""."
3,The only one that works,"This used to be an easy to replace item. After visiting two big box home improvement, one to the trade door store, and four local hardware stores, I realized I had to buy this little item online. Like the other reviewer said, it is not 36 feet (that would be some door), but 36 inches and you can easily cut it to size. Shipping rate seems high but that's probably because someone decided to design packaging which is three feet long rather than roll it into a little plastic bag (sigh). I bought two so I don't have to go through this again for a long time. If you want to make sure you have the correct item, I'd suggest going to M-D's website -- [...]"
3,Distorted view of Civil War history,"While it is a staggering work of American poetry, John Brown's Body should not - and must not - be considered a factual account of the Civil War period. Like most Civil War works published in the 1920s - the period that saw the rise of Jim Crow and the rebirth of the KKK - Benet's ""epic"" seeks to distract readers from the role slavery played in sparking the war. If we admit that slavery sparked the war, then we admit that blacks were important enough for whites to fight and die for. And in the 1920s, social pressures in the United States were aimed toward disempowering blacks. Proponents of the ""Lost Cause"" mentality will argue that the Civil War was fought not over slavery, but rather over states' rights. But states' rights to do what? Keep slaves, of course. Appreciate this book for its contribution to poetry. Do no appreciate it for its views on the Civil War."
3,a little disappointed,"I was disappointed in this pan. This pan is over priced. I ordered several small pans and thought they would all be cast aluminum. This one was not. I was very satisfied with the other pans I ordered, they were perfect and just what I expected. The other pans were $16 and this one was higher at $18. It is not cast aluminum and therefore, in my opinion, should be half the cost of the cast aluminum. Since I just received these pans I cannot comment on the baking quality. On the positive side, the pan is a perfect size for my family and I love the design. I'm just disappointed that it wasn't cast aluminum. If I would have noticed that before hand (I'm not sure that was mentioned) I probably wouldn't have ordered it."
4,Top of the Morning to you!,"Everyone is a bit Irish come March 17th, so it was only right to purchase this DVD and get a history lesson of the saint and the events that have followed over the centuries. Living in New York City all my life, you can always feel some magic as the Parade approaches and suddenly everywhere there is green. I recommend this for the historical tidbits sprinkled throughout the show."
2,Very inaccurate depiction,"I've have studied the institute of Slavery in America from 1619 to the Civil War.The film is poorly acted, you never get a sense of caring for any of the characters.The film seems to be afraid to offend the viewing audience. ""Roots"" was an important movie for that generation (70's/80/s).If you saw Roots today, it would just be an average movie. Solomon Northup's Odyssey doesn't even come close to Roots. This movie doesn't teach us anything of the true lives of people back then. This DVD should be in the $2 bargain bid at Walmart."
2,"Beneath the glitter, not all that great","Arnott is hyped as a crime writer with a wickedly origial satirical streak. This leads to some rather bizarre (and hypocritical marketing). For example, Arnott satirises the glamourising of crime and violence in the British media, yet his books are puffed by David Bowie who declares 'Whenever Arnott has a new book out, I drop everything, knowing that the next two hours are going to be pure gangland bliss'. Er, exactly.I find that in his writing Arnott slips up the social satire (which is laid on pretty thickly - public schoolboys going mockney, ghostwriters wooing criminals to publish their memoirs, that sort of thing), the style, which still doesn't present a convincing British rival to the best of American fiction, and the plot, which was implausible and failed to get the pages turning in my case."
5,Surprisingly Good Software for the Money,"I love this program. It is slick and powerful, and is now multi-threaded, so it appears to run faster than previous versions. I think this is the best version of MS Money yet. Sure, some of the neat, fringe features of previous versions are gone or dumbed down, but what remains is more than what a normal person like me needs. Obviously don't have to upgrade if you've got a previous version, or switch from Quicken if that's what you use. But this program is an awesome financial manager, despite the few caveats some users have mentioned, and is well worth the [price] or so (after rebates) that it'll cost you."
1,Not feeling secure.,"When I upgraded from a previous version of Money I was prompted to let the upgrade change my Norton firewall settings. Turned out the upgrade uninstalled the firewall completely. Why was it necessary to do this, and who would have been responsible if my system had been breached while the firewall was down?I don't like the direction Microsoft is going. Installers that remove security and Passport integration that is not easy to turn off (despite what Help says)give me the sense that Money has crossed the line from being helpful to being intrusive. I will be keeping a very close eye on Microsoft software from now on."
1,Bugs cost me 2 months of data,"After spending 3 months diligently entering data into Money 2002 deluxe, I began to have problems. First, a message 'please reload Money, a file named REPORT.DLL is missing'. Huh? I tried to reload but the same message still exist everytime I log in.Then came the nightmare. I have set up all my accounts online so I can download statements from banks, brokerages etc. After 2 months of smooth downloads however, I was unable to download statements! A message saying that I need a later version of Microsoft's strong encryption and a hyperlink to take me there. Fine. I followed the hyperlink and it was a dead link. I tried to look up strong encryption in both Money's site and the software's help section but could not find anything.I've always heard that Microsoft's products are buggy. Now I am convinced. Save you money and skip this one. I think bill gates want us to beta test his products for free"
2,Beautiful but flawed,"I converted to MS Money after 5 years with Quicken. I love the interface--it seems like no matter what you want to do, a button for it is right where you's expect it to be, and the overall workflow is much easier than Quicken. But I've had lots of problems with online access, specifically trying to sync with moneycentral, which ultimately led to my portfolio being corrupted. After much interaction with MS tech support, they have finally recommended that I re-install Win 98, and I may have lost the last four months worth of data. I recommend that any potential buyer check out the microsoft.public.money newsgroup before purchasing. There are lots of problems out there, you need to decide if this risk outweighs a potentially superior product."
3,Almost nothing new under the sun...,"I have upgraded from Money 2001 Deluxe to the Money 2002Trial version (available on Microsoft's web site) and I amquite disappointed with it. While the overall look has becomemore appealing, there aren't that many new features to mention.Perhaps this is only natural, once a software matures toa certain stage, but then there is no need to upgrade.If you haven't upgraded in a while you may want to check thisversion out. In any case take a look at the trial version,before you buy."
2,An audience recording...Beware!,"First off, the packaging is beautiful, but this is nothing more than an audience recording, so the sound is just terrible. Why is it that Asia seems completely unable to issue these live albums with a soundboard source tape. Why go with an audience recording that just doesn't sound that good and put it out on CD? Asia is a great band, but here it just seems like they are ripping people off with an inferior sounding product in a fabulous package."
4,My son loves the cassette and pictures.,"My son is 2 1/2. My husband is fluent in italian and we are always looking for italian books, music, and toys. I fully recommend these books. My son likes having his own music to play and he loves finding things in the pictures. Using an italian dictionary with the book to play "" I spy"" is a wonderful part of story time.The book is also easy enough for the non fluent relatives. Having the english version of the story right there is extremely helpful. My only reservation is that the book is in paperback. I would have given 5 stars if it was a hardback with thicker more kid resistant pages. But this book is definately worth buying even at full price!!!"
1,Coffin Corner,"I really like this author, I've read her previous works, but this book is pretty lame. I can't even bring myself to finish the last 40 pages. I really want to give her the benefit of the doubt because I liked her other books so well, but this one is confusing and very juvenile in it's structure. It does not flow well at all because nothing seems to tie the story (if there is one), together. It seems as though 20 different people had a hand in writing a few pages each. I will certainly be interested if she writes another one, because she deserves another shot, but this one is not worth the effort. Better luck next time."
3,Coke and a Smile,"This book, although factual, was slow reading. If the author would have stayed on point, the book would have been half as long. Overall a decent piece of work, but dont expect to finish it in one sitting."
3,Average thriller about mad Nuclear gamesmanship,"State Scarlet is a very dated book about a rogue U.S solider getting his hands on a portable nuke. Both the U.S.S.R and U.S wish to stop him, for their own purposes. The chase is cliche, but the book's strength is in how it portrays how American politicans use circumstances to further their own agenda. The Soviets here are more than just one-dimensional heavys, but they are still not interesting. It must have been scary for its day though."
3,Not enough to read,"My 2 year old likes the lift the flaps, but there isnt much to it. It's a cute book that I think will end up going to Grama's house. It is a cute book tho."
5,My Experience With TimeSplitters2,"I bought this game 4 days ago and i have yet to put it down, Arcade, Challenges and a story mode to boot.while the aiming may be hard to get used to it is one of the best games i have played to this day."
2,This game [ is bad],This game [is bad.] The graffix are really great but the story play is not fun at all. Also the 4 player mode isnt as great as red faction 2. its not worth buying.
5,THE BEST MULTI GAME EVER,"I don't think I have to say much, the fact that it has 4.5 stars overall should mean somthing to you. Anyway, me and my friend played this game [on gamecube] for hours on end and I STILL love it. Multiplayer is the best I have EVER played. Pick it up today, I promise you won't be disapointed...."
3,Disappointing,"The game is okay, but I was expecting much better. The graphics are plain and very cartoon-ish. This is, quite simply, an average first person shooter."
5,BUY THIS GAME!!,"LOTS OF FUN, especially in ""co-op"" mode, where you and a partner play together against the computer. 4 players can do battle if you have a big-screen TV (splitscreen). This game is reminescent of n64 golden eye. I highly recommend it!"
3,Rip Off !,"This CD is a rip off. I specifically bought the CD for the songs Baby I love your way by Will to Power and Waiting for a star to fall by Boy Meets Girl and NEITHER song is on the CD. I am baffled and frustrated. It instead has ""Can't we try"" by Dan Hill and Risque Franks and the other song that replaces the one that SHOULD be there is ""Almost paradise"" by Mike Reno and Ann Wilson from the incredibly amazing female rock band Heart. I do like both these songs but I have a Dan Hill CD on the way as I type for the song ""Can't we try"" and I don't need two CD's with the same song on them. I ONLY need ONE. I have contacted the seller and we'll see what happens."
4,Eases the pain of herniated and torn lumbar discs,"I have 2 herniated and one torn disc in the lumbar region of my back -- when the pain gets severe this product allows me to sleep or continue working at the computer -- your legs do atrophy so I remove it when the pain subsides, just like a weightlifter takes his belt off after his lift. Highly recommended"
2,All the cartoons are black and white,"Disappointed - the cover, which is the only view available, is in color. All the cartoons inside are black and white."
3,good book.,"I liked this book. The story is very sweet and I enjoyed the characters. The heroine is Serafina, a heiress who doesn't know she is an heiress, who is promised to marry Aiden, the Earl of Aubrey. Aiden is only marrying her because of her money and believes that his intended is a ugly brat. He is upset about his upcoming wedding so he goes off and soon discovers a beautiful woman asleep in the woods. He is enchanted by his fairy queen but doesn't know that she is his bride. Serafina doesn't know he is her intended either and when she discovers this she becomes very upset. They must overcome several obsticals on their way to happiness. I liked the secondary character of Raphael and I am looking forward to reading his story."
1,Buyer beware,"I bought my Saeco espresso classico SS on 5/7/04 from Whole Latte Love and used it happily for 7 months. The steam wand leaked but there were no major issues until it started smoking out of the frothing wand. I tried descaling with no luck. I sent it back to Seaco for repair and they said it was my fault. They told me that I had added something other than water to the machine (which I did not). They also said it was going to cost $112 to repair the boiler unit (I paid $350 for the machine brand new). They were charging excessive rates for labor, shipping, and labor to package for shipping. I definitely would not buy Saeco again for the lack of service. They were not willing to answer questions and stopped answering calls as well. I dealt with Ryan Hedges, Melissa Niosi, and Brandi Gibson."
1,Nice design - that's all.,"I bought this sleek espresso maker with its elegant Italian design. Unfortunately it's also Italian engineering: when I turned it on, something blew up, water was dripping out everywhere. A look into its guts made me sweat - a brittle plastic connector between pump and tubing had broken, water had squirted all over including all the electrical contacts which were right next to it and unprotected. In combination with the conducting stainless steel body this could have in fact been my strongest and final espresso. Other parts feel loose, e.g. the dial. Edges of the steel body are very sharp. I strongly discourage you from buying this item especially with this price tag. I bought a Krups 2300 plus instead. Also nice design, extremely solid make, quick heating, easy to use, superb extraction with crema, good frothing and cheaper than Saeco. No loose parts and it feels like driving a German car (Krups is German)."
1,Look Elsewhere For Inspiration,"If you are searching for yet another travel book that is poorly edited, ghastly written, and offers a list of cliche experiences, then I recommend that you buy this book.But don't take my word for it! If you want a book critic's opinion, click on the following link: http://www.qlrs.com/critique.asp?id=113As a travel writer who has worked in the industry for over 10 years, I'm deeply disappointed by the writer's over-simplification, shallow content and overall lack of style."
2,Save your money buy at wal-mart,"At three times the cheap air mattress at Wal Mart I expect this to be 3 times better. Instead it's 3 times worse. The coleman has an old school valve, the wal mart brand has a two way valve so you can open it up and air it up without worry of losing air. For me the Wal Mart brand is still going strong, the coleman has already sprung a leak and has to be aired up every 2 hours. Save your money and just buy the Wal Mart brand."
4,"Wow, really heavy duty knife.","It's really sturdy and heavy. i think the handle is too big for most of people. I have large hands so it ok for me. The blade is thick, not very sharp and need sharpenning work if you like a razor sharp blade. IMO, it's absolutely a heavy duty knife. I will be durable."
1,too bulky,"have big hands , but found this knife too bulky and heavy for pocket carry.plus all the S&W; knifes have jumped in price no longer making them the deal they once were."
5,Great book!,My son started out reading this series but - being a very avid reader myself - I read the first book in this series to 'check out' what he was reading. I got 'hooked'. Super story line and very interesting books. Kathryn Lasky is a fabulous writer.
2,caleb daniels,i still think that the first one was a little better than this one because it had more description in there
2,Great to look at when its not moving.,"We thought it might be a really exciting jumping around sort of dancing toy but it isn't, it really kind of vibrates a bit and shakes around falls on its side which is simply disappointing."
5,Great Book,This book is litterally packed with fantastic ideas to take your relationship to a whole new level.
5,works well and smells great,"I think the title says it all. The soap does the job. I'm also not a big fan of lavender by itself, but the combination of lavender and mint is was a great idea. I will defiantly buy again."
2,The FESTIVALS are GREAT but the DVD IS NOT,"The festivals are colorful and attractive but the DVD has many flaws. They do make it less interesting. Below are the reasons.The information is skin-deep. It`s because each festival is covered for only 2 minutes. That's too little information to make me interested in the subject. For example, the scene that shows Tet Festival (Lunar New Year festival) in Viet Nam. We see the hostess buying Vietnam-style fire crackers. Then, people set fire to them. Then, the camera showed people visiting pagodas. In fact, there are many other activities people doing during Tet that are omitted.In short, this type of DVDs inspires my curiosity but does not satisfy it. It`s worth watching once but not purchasing. Luckily, I borrowed it from the local library."
4,Romantic Drama classic,"The movie was great, it had intricate sub plots and great consistency. I thought it did a good job of dramatizing the issues and got you to think about the period of the piece."
4,Washington & team lead the debate,"As an historical document and a thought-provoking entertainment, this film can't be beat but unfortunately it didn't score a home run at the box office despite excellent reviews. It's certainly an appropriate docu-drama for the times now since it shows us how far we've come since the '30's and how much further we'll need to come before we can call ourselves truly ""The United States of America"". The scene of a Negro after being lynched then being burned to death was particularly disturbing but I'm glad Washington as director inserted this true incident into the film. His direction is excellent and he's abetted by a fine cast of new and older actors. Particularly amusing is the scene between him and Forest Whittaker as they carry on a casual debate in a humorous fashion. I wish there were more films of this type rather than the inane Tyler Perry films that pass as comedy-dramas. Washington & producer Oprah Winfrey should be proud of this inspirating film."
5,Great Movie,A must watch. Denzel Washington at his best. Rented it and decided to buy it. Will watch it again soon.
1,Not good,"Worst d&b CD in my collection. Sounds like a cheap knock-off. Don't buy it (or buy mine, I am looking to get rid of it)."
3,"Bad, but Crimson bad","Although one of progressive rock's classiest songwriters evaded a total stinker by placing some instrumentals and few assorted highlights throughout the depressive disc, even kings fell under the false spectacle of plasticized production during that decadent decade of recording."
2,Fracture,"As long as you want to have slightly dissonant guitar pop music without much ambition, ""Beat"" is a good purchase. Nevertheless, KC waste their talent with shallow lyrics and mediocre compositions. I wouldn't call this music progressive, and in general, KC's '80s-output is overrated. There's one good song here, the melodious ""Heartbeat"", which could have been a top-40 hit for KC. Well, the rest is just disappointing with all these meandering noodlings, and you wonder where the fiery band that wrote ""Red"" has gone. And I guess the early-'80s are the point where KC have lost their avantgarde status. Art for art's sake, it moves over the listener without having any positive impact."
2,Mediocre,"An exremly sketchy overview of the different types of mummies created by different societies in the past. Also, at one point in the book something is dated as the year zero. There is no such date."
2,not a typical Diana Palmer,"I was disappointed when reading this book. I am an avid Diana Palmer fan, but this story kept jumping around, and not enough on the two main characters. Usually, Mrs. Palmer has me hooked by the second chapter, and can not wait to see what happens next. With, After Midnight, I kept looking to see how many more chapters were left, so I could start another book. Hopefully, A Hero's Kiss (to be published later), will be much better."
2,I Tried,"I really wanted to like this band, but after tons of time listening to this only ""Cold Joint"" and the song after were any good. There is too much great music out there to waste your time on this cold and empty listening experience."
5,Excellent!,This might be their most accessible album but it is also the one I prefer. The melodies are fantastic without sacrificing the punch of their approach. Very very heavy still. I saw them during the tour after this album and it really was something back then. Very very heavy 80's music.
5,Easily the best,"Night Time is easily the best (non-greatest hits) Killing Joke album. This album showcases a great band who were way ahead of their time. The hits ""Love Like Blood"" and ""Eighties"" are great songs that sound s if they were released only yesterday."
5,TPM- review,Currently I'm working as Consultant in Lean-Six Sigma. This is an Excellent book to implement TPM in Manufacturing or process Plants.ThanksDavid M
4,Not bad...,"but inevitably it leaves out ""If It Makes you Happy""... a seminal song from ms Crow. Hence only 4 stars."
2,Ingredient Change -- Allergic Reaction,"I have used Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo for 10-15 years and I loved it, but it appears Paul Mitchell has changed the ingredients. I resently purchased a new bottle and now I am having an allergic reaction. My scalp burns, itches and has red spots. I don't have an old bottle to compare ingredients, but I noticed some of the new bottles advertise ""white ginger"" and this new bottle's ingredients does show ""white ginger."" I honestly do not know what has changed, but I can't use it any more. Why do they have to mess up a good product?"
5,Nevermore,"The end of progressive rock, but what a way to go out. Rolling Stone called UK, the great white hope of progressive rock. The music on this album is of the very first rate. Holdsworth is well Holdsworth, Bruford is a big influence in the sound, a little similar to his solo stuff. Eddie Jobson plays keyboards as good as anyone and violin as well. John Wetton is an underrated bass player and I like the way he sings, it fits the music.If this was what hit instead of Asia, the history of prog rock would have been different. Their second album was good, but not even close to this one. If you want to know what prog was all about, grab a copy of this, you won't be sorry. 5 Big Stars."
5,One of the best progressive rock albums ever.,"I really love this album. I like to think of it as ""ethereal King Crimson"". Holdsworth shines on guitar, and Jobson, well, he's one of the best."
5,Their best album yet...,"I own the album that this single is on (it was released in Europe last fall). It's by far the best album that K's Choice has released. The Almost Happy album contains great songs like ""Another Year"" which reflect a more mature K's Choice...one who is finally making the music that they want to make. It's truly incredible. Sara and Gert have really become artists with this collection."
4,Very satisfied -,"Being a huge collector of movies, I was impressed with this movie. Although I do not make a habit of purchasing movies unless I've seen them prior, I took a chance on this one and was happy I did. Sweet story line, I thought it did a great job in portraying a culture who is typically hush concerning matters of homosexuality with respect as well as open-mindedness. I enjoyed the music and plot and would definitely recommend this to others. Thank you! :)"
3,"Typical disney game, but addictive.","I bought this mainly out of chance that Disney could make a playable and enjoyable 3D game, and I was right, although you can race through the game in only a couple of days, if you work hard enough and search around long enough on every level, you can squeeze more time and enjoyment from it. more for the younger kids though, not the 3D gamers."
2,Inconstant,"I know all pillows wear out in time, but this one does so far too quickly. I have been using the firmest core for months, and can never get comfortable. There just isn't enough support in the right places. The culprit is the very cheap foam which surrounds the core. I used a contour pillow before this one for about six years and loved it until whiplash caused me to need something more firm. I have had this pillow for lest than a year, and I just moved on to the Iso-Cool Contour pillow. So far I love it...I hear it is supposed to last for years. We will see. As for this core pillow, I really don't recommend it. It does feel good at first, but that soon fades."
1,Not too pleased,"My husband and I suffer from stiff neck pain from time to time. We need good neck support while we sleep. We have tried alot of pillows over the years. Water, buckwheat, Tempura to name just a few. After reading the reviews on this pillow I felt comfortable in purchasing a couple of them for us. Mistake. These pillows are made out of VERY soft foam. Even with the choice of changeable inserts the pillow itself does not have support for your head. I only opened one pillow hoping to return the other which I did without any problems. I was very disappointed by the quality with the price I paid for this pillow."
2,Not the same Meat since Bat was on the menu,"Non-Steinman = non starter for me.Yes, some of these are reasonable songs, but even the Steinman ones have been done better elesewhere.Steinmans own (limited) version of Surfs Up was better than Meat's and Fire Inc's version of Nowhere Fast is soo much better. More ""ooomf"" and rhythm. I ddn't like the song until I heard Fire Inc's version.I agree with Jim Steinman, that after Bat, Meat Loaf's voice was never the same again.Meat just tried too hard since then. Bat 1 was perfect. Best album ever foe me.He even sounds great in Hot Patooie in the Rocky Horror!! His voice seemed to break again after Bat."
4,A Good (but not great) CD,"I proudly own every CD Meat Loaf has ever released (excluding remixes). I have to say this is probably my least favourite and it has nothing to do with Meat at all. While some of the songs are delightful, there are a few on which the music is so loud compared to the vocals that I had to change my equalizer setting to hear the vocals at all. I paid to hear Meat sing, not to have dance music with lyrics I can't hear. There are really only 2-3 songs like that, so it still deserves a good rating.A couple of the tracks have become earworms; I just can't get Bad Attitude and Modern Girl out of my head."
2,Had this tested on me and found it did the same amount of damage to the person giving the dose.,Upon getting her first pepper spray canister my friend was wondering about the effectiveness of the spray she asked if she could try it on me which she did. It took her 3 tries to get around the childproof trigger then after spraying it took 45 seconds for the spray to take effect. With her standing 10 feet away the spray hit her too causing her to cough and dry heave. As to the effectiveness the device caused partial-thickness chemical burns across my face and eyes. It was partially incapacitating but if I had the drive it would not have dropped me. I reccomend getting a stun gun if you actually want to get away from an attacker. This is best used for stopping a gunman when you have no other option.
1,Broken,"The damn thing kept popping off at the keyring and falling off. One day, it just popped off and I didn't notice for several hours. Such a waste of money."
1,I wouldn't trust my life with it,"Pros* Excellent Design* Fumble free use* Small and compact* No leather pouches to openCons* Made from cheap plastic* Awful customer service* Fell apart when I tried to use itI unfortunately had to use the spitfire, and I pulled it off the keychain (a feature of this device), and the thing fell apart in my hands. Luckily the threat was averted and it was not needed, but this is not what you want to worry about when your life is on the line.I would not purchase this item. Hopefully they read this review and make it with a strong ABS plastic and stronger fastening, because they sure didn't respond to my emails.Shame really, I truly wanted to believe in this product. Unfortunately, it failed me."
1,These Pan Handles don't fit Green Pans! NO REFUND!,I have green pots and pans and these Black Silicone Pan Handles don't fit. I need to return them for a refund.
5,Outrageous and Wonderful,"George & Martha is hilarious, filled with wonderful illustrations and crazy scenarios. Karen Finley's smart and radical idea of George W. Bush and Martha Stewart having an on-going affair is brilliant. Their somewhat twisted relationship manages to capture all that's currently wrong with this country. Politically smart and sexually charged it's laugh out loud funny but cry inside tragic. Read this book!"
5,Devastating satire,"Riffing on Edward Albee's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?' and the mama and daddy of our country, George and Martha paints a brief portrait of George W. and Martha Stewart's complicated love affair. The two icons of global crisis and domestic comfort talk, drink, fight, love, and reveal their respective hard and soft spots on a hideous polyester bedspread in a hotel room. This is devestating and biting satire on the order of Steven Colbert's recent performance White House Correspondents Dinner. It's incredibly funny, - but um, why aren't we laughing? The book includes hundreds of illustrations also by Finley. I loved it!!"
1,Garbage,This item is cheaply made. Magnets barely work. I bought this as a gift for my father-in-law and I was embarrassed when he opened it and we couldn't find any metal objects light enough to stick. Not even a large nail would hold. The magnets might be strong enough to hold a small paperclip or some loose staples and that's about it. Don't waste your money.
5,Men Made Easy,Excellent book! Extremely informative and very interesting. Excellent writer with valuable information. Every woman will benefit from this book. I highly recommend this five star book! Anne from Florida
2,Not the whole truth,"I read this book several years ago. At the time, the guides seemed reasonable. But now that I am older, I have had the opportunity to reflect on other, more profound truths about relationships. It is not true that the whole of your ""femenine"" attractiveness is contingent on shoes, skirts and makeup. Like the author, I have also studied men and women throughout my life, and have discovered that when all is said and done, a human being is going to feel love for your essence. Your beauty is a deeper, more spiritual experience for a man if he is a spiritual man first. Everything else in the book is basically unaturallly staged, nothing like the real thing each of us has to offer."
3,Soundtrack is a Classic,"I couldn't find this soundtrack on Itunes so I decided I had to order it, for collectors sake. ""The Tony Montana Theme"" and ""Rush Rush"" are definitely my favorite tracks. Enjoyable listen in the car and on long drives. Must have for any diehard Scarface fan."
5,Great DVD,This is yet another great Steve Irwin DVD. My child is a huge fan of him and just loves this DVD.
1,This is not the way wildlife should be handled,"I do not believe Steve Irwin handles wildlife appropriately. His intrusive methods are bordering on something like molestation and are also too risky. Recently he ventured too close to wildlife in Antarctica (illegally) but was not charged, probably due to his political connections. I think the Irwin show needs to be taken off the air for good."
3,Not what I expected.,I got this because I bought the regular scent from the mall. I love the way it makes my hands and body feels but I dont like the scent. I was expecting something a little more softer or sexier.
4,I give it a four!,"I recently saw The Forty Fives open up for Southern Culture on the Skids and I was unexpectedly delighted with their sound and even more so for their energy. There are no musical revelations on this recording but it did yield some fun, catchy and energetic tunes. This CD is not recommended for music elitist of the likes that have written scathing reviews on this page but for those who want something new that runs at a different pace."
3,Shapiro Great View of South China,Good program and a great view of REAL CHINA. Little biased but good work. Three stars for the effort. Those guys doing GLOBE TREKKER should start to be less BIASED about places and people. Give the impression they are better and superior...
3,Photographic Imaging Techniques in C++,"This is a useful book, on a topic that will become more practical with greater use of CD-R's for image storage. The material is presented at a level that is reasonable, but it assumes that the reader has considerable programming experience in C++. Almost half of the book is C++ program code, and you will not learn much without going through the code in detail. Unfortunately, only BMP images are covered in the code. Also, although the test applications that were in executable code ran in the 16-bit versions, the 32-bit versions failed, and I have not been able to get support from the publisher."
5,"""Don't call it a comeback, they've been her for years...""","Plain and simple, Pearl Jam have been releasing quality albums for years, which pretty much is only known by those really following the band closely. However, there is something different with this album that we haven't seen in the last few years. There is an edge and an appeal that's present with this album that I think will draw casual observers in. Eddie and the guys rip it up on this very solid effort, and you get a very good vibe after the first two or three tunes, and, it get's better with each track. The tour will be incredible. Many will call it a comeback, but it really doesn't apply. Buy this album. Long live PJ."
4,OTRO GRAN CD DE LA MEJOR BANDA DEL PLANETA!!!!!!!,"El nuevo CD de PEARL JAM es realmente excelente y lo situo de una vez como entre mis preferidos de esta espectacular banda , ademas PEARL JAM es mi banda preferida de todos los tiempos y sin lugar a dudas han creado un gran trabajo musical lleno de buen rock y de sonidos que me lleva varios a?os a tras cuando comenzaban y fueron en su momento la mejor banda del planeta por sus inolvidables TEN , VS Y VITALOGY. canciones como Comatose, Life wasted, World wide suicide ,Army reserve, Inside job y Big wave son realmente epicas y de lo mejor en los ultimos tiempos.Salud a todos los fans de PEARL JAM"
4,Good job guys,"It is good to see pearl jam rock out on their latest accomplishment. i was beginning to worry that they would simply fade out in obscurity. the songs on this record form a more cohesive mix compared to riot act and binaural together, both of which were fairly decent albums. i have noticed that many have criticized eddie vedder of being too political on this record, which i find strange because he usually has a few songs with political lyrics on them. there are certainly a few on vs.one thing i've always liked about pearl jam is that their opening songs are usually strong (Brain Of J, Once, Go and now Life Wasted). i'm also very glad to see mike mccready writing more music on this record compared to previous releases (he only co-wrote Save You on Riot Act)he even proceeded to write lyrics on inside job, which he did a fantastic job on.Another thing i liked on this record is the riff work on Unemployable. overall this is a strong album for pearl jam, their best work in the last 6 years."
5,PEARL JAM 's got the power again!!!!,"I've listened this new album and I must say that It's very good!!!All the songs are good, good lyrics with powerchords, also the balladas are beatiful.Thanks Pearl Jam for doing good music."
1,sounds of the 90's without the melodies,"i've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code'. this band was just getting worse with every album. eventually, i caught on and stopped wasting my $. i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright. who the @$#%@ are these dumb reviewers? are they getting paybacks? is this politics or music? live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that. they still know how to play, but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive, appealing songs. also, maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich isn't helping! only put 1 song on my mp3 players...= 1 star."
4,To all you Jaded PJ fans...............,"I wish i could say that this cd was excellent but so far its only average. Though i am an extreme PJ fan i dont feel that this cd is their ""best work in 10 years."" The entire cd but the last 2 songs are pretty blan but I know that more i listen to it ill start to like the other songs alot more. The cd is good if you have the patience to listen to it and i recomend it to anyone who is a PJ fan because they will definetly respect the cd as whole over time. Good cd but not great. Cant wait for thier tour."
4,Best PJ CD In Over a Decade.,"Between 1991 and 94 Pearl Jam released three of the best CDs of the decade. Unfortunatley after ""Vitalogy"" the bands releases became more and more inconsistent. Don't get me wrong each of the releases in the latter half of the 90s up through ""Riot Act"" in 02 had some good tunes but none of these CDs as a whole held up. There live shows were still fantastic and it looked as if Pearl Jam was headed the way of the Grateful Dead and being known as a great live band that would be better served releasing there all of their shows on CD. With their new self-titled release the band shows they can still put out a great record. ""Life Wasted"" ,""Severed Hand"", ""Marker In the Sand"" and ""Unemployable"" are some of the best songs they've ever recorded. The band sounds re-energized on this CD. Welcome back PJ!"
5,My favorite cd! this cd will blow you away!,"I am new to Pearl Jam.My older bother has all their cd's.I have listened to some of them and I like ten and the cd with the dog on the cover.That cd is really fantastic.This cd really blew me away.I cannot descibe the feeling I had when I first heard this cd.It's astonishing.These guys are really good musicians who know how to rock and put a great cd together.The entire cd just gels.I'm 14 years years old and I'd say this rocks alongside on par with Led Zeppelin.Having said that,I'd say this rocks louder, faster and better than Led Zeppelin.Peace OutJason in Canada"
4,Wonderfully refreshing return...,Pearl Jam has always been a favorite of mine. This album is a great return as we haven't heard from the band in a while. The tunes *Life Wasted* and *Worldwide Suicide* really reflect the artists' disgust with our current president and the government tactics that we all have to deal with.The album reminds me a bit of Vitalogy.I was so pleasantly surprised to listen to what I believe is a sort of comeback for the band that layed in wait before they had something to say. And I suppose this is best....why speak until you have something to say? Pearl Jam has been a band of few words...unless there was something to say. And say it they always have. This album is a great one. The band and it's individual components are more mature and more comfortable in their own skin. Their music reflects that.Thanks Eddie and the boys! Good Job!
2,"Wow, it's okay!...(by a guy who is NOT a Pearl Jam fan)","I can't stand Pearl Jam's Ten album. Its droopy generic grunge, mixed with a singer that I can't stand listening to for more than a couple minutes, makes it, in my humble opinion, one of the worst albums of all time. Well, Eddie Vedder's voice still makes me physically uncomfortable, but the music behind him this time is solid, groovy grunge metal. Somewhat improved from the group that brought us the uninspired (and boring as hell) Jeremy, Black, Evenflow, and Alive."
2,enough with the politics,"I have to agree with the reviewer from January 1st, Hoplite Whatever-his-name-is on one thing. Pearl Jam needs to get rid of the Bush-bashing. I say this not in any great defense of our current president; I am neither pro- nor anti-Bush. I am a registered independent, and so have no interest in feeding the two-headed monster that has a stranglehold on our political system. However, I am tired of hearing PJ bitch and moan about everything Bush does. I'll bet they would even criticize the way the man takes a piss. They should do what every other empty-headed, plastic personality celebrity should do in regards to political statements: leave it alone."
4,Rock and Roll's last great hope,"What more needs to be said? whether or not you been a fan since their early days or just hearing about them for the first time, this album won't let you down. Unlike Binural and Riot Act this album is much or alive and full of energy, I can't complain too much about this one, Big Wave is nothing more than a filler and Come Back is also skippable. Other than that the songs are great, Inside Job being the most amazing one."
5,Yes,"If you like Pearl Jam at all, quit reading these reviews, hurry and buy this album, turn it way up, and you can thank me in a few months when you finally take it out of your cd player. If you're one of ""those"" Pearl Jam fans, who with each subsequent album after ""Ten"", are still waiting for a ""Jeremy Reprise"" or ""Evenflow II"", you won't find that here. However, you will find something better: Fresh, energetic, vibrant rock and roll from a great rock and roll band. This album is excellent."
4,"I do care, that you do see...","It really wouldn't require much effort for RCA to assemble a better-sounding version of this set; after all, the individual albums were nicely remastered in 1995. Apparently they lack the neccessary motivation to do so, however, since they continue to sell this rather murky-sounding edition, which dates back to 1987. It's a shame, because it _is_ the best Airplane compilation on the market, better than the too-slender _Worst Of_ or the moronic _Airplane/Starship Hits_."
3,Less than great yet not awful,"There is less to this film and even less-er looking at the cover box of the DVD. Whom the movie provides to be the insane killer is given away.This said, it has great production values, well enough acted and gory.Overlong however."
1,as a matter of fact I DO!,"hey, what's your problem, evol187? So what if I do want to suck Art Witlow's d!ck? So what if I am a f@g? People who are afraid of exploring other lifestyles ain't nuthin but p*ssies. And p*ssies end up getting f*ck*d by d!cks. When you go there and come back, you'll know, bro. Till then, don't diss it."
4,Expectations....,"It's amazing really, I sure hope this is an album that grows on you, because only a few songs are good, and the only ""great"" song that really brings back that raw 3-6 lyrical essence is sippin. Though Put Ya Signs is good, 3-6 almost always sounds better without a chorus, and most of these songs have a chorus. Every song has a mad beat that is waiting for a 3-6 member to get into the flow and just let it all out, and while some points hit it well, some just drag on like a weak Jr. High Choir. I still give this a 4/5 because it is one of the better rap cd's, just not the best we all know 3-6 can do."
2,shyt i dont know why errbody luv dis album so much,i love three 6 but dis is dey worst albumprolly da only tight junts on here is sippin on some sizzurp & im so hiotha den dat dont pick up dis shyt
1,Boring,"This is a really boring book. As you read it, you're always waiting to get to the interesting part that never really arrives. Hotten's writing style is very dry and the book reads like a textbook. He also constantly repeats the same things over and over again - yes, I already know that F1 is very expensive, Ferrari is passionate and Williams has great engineering.Even the layout of the book can get frustrating. The chapters don't flow well and the whole book comes off as being incoherent and repetitive. Hotten should have gathered all his facts and then let someone else write and edit the book for him, probably down to about half its current size. I'm not sure if I can recommend another book for people interested in learning about the F1 business, but I can certainly advise against getting this one."
2,Rent it,"Long-term ELP fans will be annoyed by the chatty dressing-room approach to the history of the band. None of the discussions were particularly interesting, and added nothing to the collection of videos. I'm sure there are better films of ELP out there, and someday a fine producer will make a better presentation."
2,Image drops the ball,"It's a bit silly that Image included both a stereo and 5.1 DD soundtrack on ths disk because it's a direct port from the video and is almost entirely in mono!!!! Only two songs from the entire program are presented in stereo, and there is no use of center channel or surround. Of course, one would expect this for the older footage but for the 90's material this is inexcusible. As if that weren't enough, the audio tracks are very dirty with lots of digital artifacts. Unless you just can't live without the slightly improved video offered here or plan to watch it 1,000 times most ELP fans will probably want to stick with a VHS copy of this one."
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"After reading the DVD box, I was looking forward to seeing a live performance by one of my all time favorite bands, but there's not one complete song on the entire DVD. Instead you get a tease of live footage and a lot of idle chatter that adds nothing. The sound quality is poor at best and the video footage is worse. Don't waste your money on this title."
2,ELP not in concert,I was hopeing this would show the band in concert but that is not what you get here a lot of talking not much rocking there a great band and I hope one day to see them on a dvd or vhs that shows how great they are have not seen it so far!
1,Waste of time and money,"I should have listen to the other reviewers, but as a fan I thought I would give it a try. What a mistake. I am writing my first review ever just in case anybody is thinking about getting it. Do not waste your money, and trust other reviewers who felt the same.It gets no star from me."
1,Disappointing,This DVD is disappointing even for a die-hard ELP fan like me. There is not one complete song on the entire DVD. Its value as a documentary is low due to poor video quality and bizarre combinations of interview clips overlaying what little music there is. Can I get my money back?
4,"A superb introduction to Bruford, the fusion years","This CD came out relatively early in the history of the format -- just three years after CD players invaded Western markets. It was, at the time, a god send because you could only acquire the CD versions of any Bruford albums via very expensive Japanese import. I didn't fancy paying $50 for either of my two Bruford favourites -- 'One of a Kind' (OoaK) or 'Feels Good to Me' (FGtM).This compilation covers Bruford's masterpiece - OoaK -- pretty well. It also covers the later, not-quite-so-good albums, very adequately. The real problem is that it ignores the four classics from FgtM, namely 'Adios a La Pasada', 'Feels Good to Me', 'Either End of August' and 'Springtime in Siberia'. If you really insist on buying only one Bruford album, get this compilation. But you will quickly find yourself buying two more: OoaK and FGtM. (Sorry about the abbreviations.)"
4,I read it. Do I believe it? I'm not sure...It hurts!,"I read it. Do I believe it? I'm not sure, but the fact that I have a doubt is cause enough for worry and I think that the book has succeeded in convincing you that there is a doubt. It's scary stuff if viewed as fiction, but for someone that is open-minded, it can be a nightmare...Could such a thing happen in a modern democratic country? Especially, Israel???? It hurts!"
1,buyer beware,What a disappointment. If you buy this product thinking you're going see any of the shorts that you remember as a kid you will be disappointed
4,EVERY BODY CUT FOOTLOOSE!!,"I saw a stage prodution of Footloose featuring two of the people that sing in this soundtrack and feel in love with it.... I enjoy almost all the songs on her, although some are too slow for my taste......I recomened this soundtrack to all people who would like a flashback........."
2,Another slaughtered re-release,"This should have been the best re-release of Fripp's best album, but it's been botched again. They edit out so many of the instrument lines and audio hooks that it's not even worth the price of getting it. ""Chicago"" and ""Exposure"" are just bone-chilling on the original cassette and LP, ""NY3"" and ""Here Comes the Flood"" are missing a keyboard and an echo, respectively. Every song on the album has been altered in some way, or is not up to par because of the out-of-synch job done with the others.An avoidable re-release of an earth-moving album. I bought a fifty-cent cassette copy of the original version, and it runs circles around this cd copy that I own."
2,Pass,"Obviously, this artist deserves a tremendous amount of respect for his contributions to music, given his strong reviews and work with other musicians. But, with the exception of a few tracks including either Hall or Gabriel, I don't see those contributions presented well here. It seems to be a freeform musical (not so much lyrical) exploration of something. As for Peter Gabriel's Here Comes The Flood, the version found here may stand above the one found on PG1, but the piano & vox version found on PG's Shaking The Tree record tops them all."
5,Long-Awaited Daryl Hall Vocals are Here,"I liked this album from the first release just to hear the Daryl Hall vocals and I wasn't disappointed. After 28 years, I'm not disappointed again. I went straight to disc number 2 to listen to the Hall vocals on ""Exposure"", ""Mary"" (it's nice to hear him sing the word ""sister"" correctly...), ""Disengage"", ""New York, New York, New York"" and ""Chicago"".I think this album is a fine collaboration with Daryl's soaring vocals and Robert Fripp's production. Fripp's use of all those tape loops (aka ""Frippertronics"") made me wonder if the 24-bit re-mastering would expose the tape noise to go with it but that problem was taken care of.""Exposure"" is part of a trilogy of albums that included the Peter Gabriel album which I haven't heard and the ""Sacred Songs"" album by Daryl Hall which uses Fripp's production throughout. I highly recommend getting the Buddah Records release of that album with bonus tracks."
5,A work still in progress,"At last, the original mix of Exposure on CD! Together with lots of extra material, revealing many of the possibilities and the alternatives of a really creative musician ... Plus the excellent notes and pics."
4,mixed,"Instrumental stuff is great, guitar playing is great...but some of the vocals are downright awful and embarrassing. Some are good (Daryl Hall, Peter Gabriel) but whoever the screamer is and the girl is are really, really bad, just hard to listen to. I guess the material is supposed to be 'challenging', and as an album I think it's still worth checking out, but don't be surprised if you cover your ears or skip a song or two."
1,Far too small,"The product description implies that this handle can be used with any pan, however, this handle is really only intended for a pan that has a thin, flat handle.Also: don't get this handle thinking it could be used on a smaller fry pan, I did manage to get it to fit over the handle of an 8"" fry pan but the silicone split after one use."
4,Dragonflies Through Binoculars,"I purchased this book at the end of the season, so have not had a chance to ID a specimen with it yet, but it seems like a more complete book then the beginner types I have. There are a lot more species then some other books, and good range descriptions. I do wish the pictures were larger, but to have as many types in a book the size of this one makes that an impractical wish. Overall, this book is worth the money if you are into dragonflies."
4,Unique and sweet baby record,"This book is very personal, unique and artful. I much prefer the style to any pre-printed baby book I have seen. It is small and paperback, so lends itself more to a journal, which I like. I keep it at my bedside and write when the mood strikes (and no one is crying or hungry!). Because it is less formal, I feel more comfortable just picking it up to write. In my opinion, it is a nice addition to (rather than a replacement for) a more formal, sturdy, large book for holding photos and keepsakes. It doesn't seem like it would withstand a lot of wear and tear, but I'm not sure how important this is anyway. I especially like it for the second child because her ""baby book"" will certainly have pictures of her big sister too, while this is a nice place, dedicated only to her."
1,If only there were aa zero star rating...,I have to agree with everyone else. This game was horrible. I actually bought it used and I thought it was a great deal at only 15 bucks. To bad I hadn't come online first to find out new its just about 20 bucks. That should have clued me in from the start. Avoid this game and save up for something thats worth it.
5,A PERFECT BUCKET BAG !,"THIS WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE HANDBAG FOR ON THE CAMPUS. OR THE BUSY WOMAN WHO IS BOTH A HOUSWIFE WHO MUST CARRY EXTRAS FOR THE BABY OR FOR THE OFFICE. SHOWN IN KHAKI... OTHER LARGER STYLES OF THIS WOVEN LEATHER LOOK HANDBAG COMES IN BONE, KAHKI AND CHOCALATE. GET YOURS WHILE THEY LAST."
3,Does this have subtitle or caption?,Wanted to know this before purchasing. Warner Bros. digital copy doesn't have either as far as I know (and I've bought some of them to my chagrin)
2,Love him but this a terrible movie,"The characters never really fully develop and, it's a dark miserable story with people running, crying, screaming, at times you need to stop and say to yourself what's going on. I felt nothing for him as a character neither did I feel anything for any of them, I wasn't socked I was bored.It's OK to watch on an airplane ride so you can fall asleep...from 1 to 10 I give a 5"
2,"English subtitles are hardcoded, no option to turn them off in the setup menu either","It is a good movie, but the subtitles in English are hard coded into the movie, ruining it for me.I don't like subtitles in my movies, so I will probably trade this in for something else."
2,Unintentionally hilarious,"This is a hokey, dated, low-budget quasi-drama which crumbles despite a potentially interesting premise: a possibly rabid man ties himself to a post. Unfortunately, high jinx ensue, and whatever drama could have existed is obscured by child anti-star Gus' stereotypically bad acting and shaggy (anti)haircut. My favorite scenes are when Gus brings blankets (for no apparent reason) and gets socked in the kisser. The hallucinatory scene where the guy gets attacked by a Davy Crockett hat takes the cake though. Truly one of the funniest bits ever captured on film. Inconsequential sideplots abound, naturally... and what a conclusion!"
5,A nice preview for young kids,"Number the stars is a good look for pre-teens and teens into what was going on during WWII. It is the story of Anne Marie, her family, and her neighbors the Rosens. The German army has soldiers on every corner in Denmark. The Rosens realize they need to get out Denmark to a country were it is safe. The story is one of friendship and courage. I truly recommend this book for all kids to read. It would be best if they followed up with the Devil's Arithmetic. Get past the slow parts in the Devil's Arithmetic, because it gets great after that."
3,Pretty Good,"I'm an 11 year old girl and have read Number the Stars several times. It's a good, accurate book, but I've kind of already outgrown it. I can't relate much to the main character anymore, because she seems so young and clueless."
2,It was ok,"I thought it was ok, I was expecting alot though, from reading the back of the book I thought it sounded exicting but I wasn't pleasantly surprised, the high point of the book is only like a page and it is so corny. I guess if you want to read a book and fast than this is it. I don't recomend it."
1,This is the worst book ever!!!,I hated this book but I had to read it for school! I had to make my self get through it! I would never recommend this book to anybody! It has horrible characters. You don't feel like you even know who the person is. DO NOT READ IT! It isn't even very exciting!
1,Number The Stars,I didnt like the book because I didnt like the story line because I've read books with the same story line.
5,Roma Parekh,"I read this book in 6th grade, and I loved it. I remember starting to cry, but am extremely happy that I did read it."
4,The mysterious book,I liked this bllizzedful book because it was a great expiriece for a jewish People.The main reazon that this book was created was that the history a long time ago was very hard because soldiers that day where realy mean and put jewish in a terraffing place.I recomend this amazing story.
4,"Interesting, but A Bad Ending","Most of the book was very exciting and it kept me reading. But the end was a disapointment. I was left thinking,""That's it?"" However, aside from the bad ending it's an excellant book and I felt for the main characters. Then again, I am Jewish so the Holocaust might affect me more than someone else."
4,Very great book for kids.It's interesting& teaches about ww2,It was VERY interesting. It was a GREAT book! It teachers kids about WW2 & yet it is so... INTERESTING! Alot of books teach kids but they are just plain BORING!Unlike this one!!
5,"""I didn't want to put the book down it was so exciting""",I definitly recomend reading this book. It is one of the best books that I have acually wanted to read.
5,The Best Book,This book was great!This book is really interesting because I really like history.I'm going to like to read it over again a few times!
4,A wonderful Book! You must read!,"This was a great book by Lois Lowry. I have read a few book of his and this is his best. It is about a 10 year old girl named Annemarie Johansen. She is trying to help her friend, Ellen Rosen, from the Nazis. In the begining Annemarie and Ellen arn't that woried about the war. They going on living their life day to day. Until the Nazis come looking for Ellen's family. She moves in with Annemarie. Can she save Ellen's family in time? The setting is in Denmark, Germany. It takes place in 1943."
3,good book,I thought this book was ok. I don't remember to much but Iknow it was about a girl trying to escape from nazis
3,AN O.K. BOOK PROBABLY WOULDN'T RECOMEND IT TO TO MANY PEOPLE,I HAD A BOOK REPORT DUE IN TWO DAYS AND I HAD ONLY GOTTEN TO ABOUT PAGE 60 IN NUMBER THE STARS. I WAS NOT THAT INTERESTED IN IT SO I GOT ALL MY INFO FROM AOL AND THE BACK OF THE BOOK.THIS BOOK IS WONDERFUL IF YOU LIKE THAT WAR LIKE BOOKS. THIS WAS A BOOK THAT WAS ASSIGNED AND I HATE READING SO ANY BOOK REALLY STINKS. IFF YOU ENJOY WAR AND FIGHTS AND ALL THAT KIND OF HISTORY THEN I RATE THIS BOOK A 9% BUT IF YOU ARE LIKE ME THAN5%*6%.
3,STARS,"Will allways make you think what will happen next. I gave it a three stars because I do not like it that much. I think it could be a lot better. Ithink it good be better because at a pount it gets boring. Some parts you can gess what will happen next. The afterward part at the end is ok because one main character dies, who is nan member of the resistance movement, and you have to read the book to find out who."
5,A beautifully written account of beating the Final Solution,"Number the stars is a beautifully written account of the Danish people's humane and dangerous determination to save their Jewish citizens from Hitler's Third Reich during World War II.The Final Solution did not have any success in Denmark because of the beliefs that this country held in their hearts. This book is an excellent introduction to the horrors of WWII without illustrating the shocking accounts too graphically. As an adult who has done a lot of reading about this terrible time in history, I found this book to be exquisite and touching.I believe that it is a topic that should be introduced at about age twelve, a very critical time of life for children. This is a perfect book for opening the eyes of adolescents: it will provoke questions that will need to have answers. A young person reading this book should have someone they can talk to about these terrible events."
3,Only okay. Should not have won such a prestigious award.,"After reading ""The Giver"", also by Lowry, I expected ""Number the Stars"" to be MUCH better than it was. (""The Giver"" is my all-time favorite winner of the Newbery. Highly recommended.) ""Number the Stars"" is a decent, but unspectacular, book which pales in comparison to ""I Am David"" by Anne Holm. That story portrays the suffering of the Jews with more depth and feeling than this one. Read that instead."
1,Boring and unlikable,"I was forced to read this In fifth grade and again In sixth, I hated it as much as Johnny Tremain."
4,Number the stars-a wonderful book,"Number the StarsLois LowryLaure leaf, 1998, 144pp. $5.99ISBN: 0440227534Lois LowryImagine this, you live in Denmark and everyday you have to worry about if the Nazis are coming. Well that's exactly what Annemarie has to do 24/7! How long would you survive? Could you stand it long enough?A young Danish girl, Annemarie, and her little sister, Kristi, can't remember the last time they weren't in hiding. In this wonderful story about always looking out for the ones you love. Annemarie must keep an eye on her Jewish friend Ellen, as well as keeping herself and her sister safe. Lois Lowry does an amazing job of giving the detail needed in this star-studded story of the Holocaust.This book may appeal to anyone who likes historical fiction or likes adventure books. This book isn't just a children's book, it can be a great read aloud for parents and kids!"
4,"Interesting, if uneven eighties maiden voyage..","I'm inclined to agree with one of the reviewers below, that listening to this album after hearing such Crimson stuff like Lark's Tongues or 21st Century Schizoid Man is a little like seeing Al Pacino in Scarface after watching Serpico. Still, this album has a lot going for it, hardly the least of it being that it signified a newly formed '80's incarnation of the King, which was obviously as influential for groups (paging Primus..) as the other albums. Adrian Belew has a decent voice and made for an interesting foil for Fripp, while Bill Bruford storms accordingly on the skins. Too essential for Crimsonite to pass on."
5,Fripp gets Discipline,"Fripp spent 3 years after he broke up Crimson in 1975 studying the works of JG Bennett. Well, he really reinvented himself here with a new and improved version of Crimson. The tragedy is, it's one of the best records of the 80's that I'll bet not many people have ever heard!"
5,Love it!,This meditation dvd is wonderful! I felt refreshed and revitalized after completing all 3- 20 minute sections. I was so relaxed and felt almost as though someone had vaccumed all the heavy thoughts from my brain. I would highly recommend this to anyone needing to learn how to do deep breathing in order to achieve a calm mind and body.
4,A good reference book,"The information provided in this book is very comprehensive. There is a lot of sections on pen rendering used in the past and the types of materials used. But today, in the 21st century, most artists prefer the technical pen to that of the quill. All the drawings presented in the book are in black and white. I wish there are some in colour inks and combination with water-colours. I also wish it includes drawings of present day pen artists with their masterpieces. All in all, it is a good reference book."
5,Love it,I've been through many boosters-- and this one is top notch!It's plush and more compfy than some of the others... the sliding cup holders are nice- good size for normal drinks.
3,Not as good as all his other stuff,"Steve Lawler is one of my favorites and is definitely one of the best DJs to emerge over the past year. However, This CD did not live up to my expectations of Lawler. The CD starts strong but gets weaker as the CD goes on. Don't get me wrong -- this is still a good CD, I'm just very selective and have heard much better stuff from him. If you really want to get a good taste of what Lawler is capable of, you can't go wrong with his GU NuBreed dbl. CD."
1,Weak.,"It may be that I enjoy a fatter,richer brand of music, but Steve Lawler, to me, is nothing like he is made up to be. This album left me waiting for the bass to kick in, and wondering when the sensuous layers of sound weaving were going to begin. Then I realized the track was over! Perhaps this sound is better suited for a club atmosphere. I found it to be a very disappointing watery, wirey, wasteland of thin composition. I didn't like it. Sorry, Steve."
3,Dark...as on the floor in the back of my car....,I turned it off half way through. Disapointed compared to his other releases.
4,Perfect!,"If you're looking for a low-cost bicycle grip, these can't be beat! And yes, they come with the end plugs as well!"
1,"Terrible, makes my hands and fingers numb.",These grips are too thick and pump up my hands which makes them uncomfortable. I will be removing them asap and replacing with regular rubber hand grips.
4,Ozomatli rocks!,"Ozomatli is one of the greatest hip hop acts around. Anyone that likes either hip hop or latin music should definately get this cd to get a taste of them or get their album for a whole platter, its definately worth it!"
2,Not bad,"This CD is okay, it has good songs on it like ""You Came Up"", ""Live From New York"", and ""Quiet Storm"" but overall, it's not that great of a mix. I don't recommend it."
2,"Story good, but.....","It's way too mushy. Every other page, she's hanging all over this guy.I'm a girl and I definitely act like a girl, but not all girls hang all over guys all the time.I would recommend this book for someone in their teens, little girls might find this ""gross"".Other than that, the story developed nicely, there was a nice plot, and a nice twist at the end. That alone made it worth reading.However, because of course language and all that romance, I give it a 2 star rating."
4,My Secret War,"Madeline Beck is a girl who had just moved to long island, New York and was not having much fun. She had only been there for a week so she hadnt made any friends. She was living with her mother and other residents in MRs. Hawkins' Mansion by the sea her clothes were out of stle as well as her hai, she bit her nails and had a gap between her teeth. To try to make her some frinds she tried to make herself more pretty but there was one prerson who thought she was beautiful the way she was and that was Johnny Vecchio Her and Johnny started riding their bikes everyday while getting to know each other. They both decided to make a group called the k3f club to help support World War 2. They nick named each other and had a secret code that they would write and send to each other. Most went well until Maddie's father got injured so she dropped out of the club."
3,What Elissa thinks of the book.,I am intrested in this style of book because the history of WWII is what i enjoy reading. The girl in this book also reminds me of myself because she is interested in the war and tries to do something to help with the battle outcomes that are accuring.I like the way the Author placed the book in diary form because it gives me more of a way that the girl is thinking and not having the author try to explain in a different style of writting.
4,A Must Read,"In Language Arts Class we had to read a book and write a review about it. I read the book My Secret War. It's about a girl named Madeline and her pal Johnny. My favorite part in the book was when Madeline and Carla became such good friends. The book takes place during World War II. At points during the book, Madeline fears for hers and her fathers lives. It is because of these fears that she is able to do somthing great and help with the war. Madeline and Johnny also go to great risks to report the dangerous and scary secrets about the Germans. There is also a romantic twist between Madeline and Johnny. This should take them well beyond good friend in their future. However, Madeline must leave her friends, school, and Johnny behind to go someplace to see her father. She doesn't know if she will ever see them again."
5,Words just can't describe his music!,"That's right...I can't describe his music using words! Just listen then you'll understand. By the way, I just bought a second tape (abused the first one...he..he..he! ) WHERE ARE THE DVDs OF HIS CONCERTS?"
1,"I would give it 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me",Evil. I was forced to watch it in orchestra class. I have never seen a gayer movie. Some odd little man playing music and dancing! Yeeeeaaaaa!
5,My Mom loves it.,"I bought this for my mother, and she loves it. She's hard to please so it must be good."
5,GRAB THIS ONE WHILE IT IS STILL AFFORDABLE,"I'd highly recommend for any Pirates fan to grab this set asap, unless you actually WANT to pay hundreds of dollars for their other stuff. It is still AFFORDABLE (at least for now) at well under $20 and has 2 CDs of great BBC Sessions. I have it and it is great--excellent liner notes too! Also--I get SO sick of all these artists whining and crying about people downloading their rare, hopelessly out-of-print music, while they don't even bother to keep it in print and affordable for everyone (duh!). Quit your bitching and reissue your stuff with bonus tracks like everyone else! This way, I can gladly pay a mere $15 or $20 for the reissues and laugh at these bozos still trying to sell the obsolete versions for outrageous prices."
3,"good music, but...","The song selection on this collection is, to put it blunty, terrible. The back of the case reads ""taken from: In the Court of the Crimson King, In the Wake of Poseidon, Red, Discipline, Three of a Perfect Pair"". Sounds good, right? A pretty good overview of the band's early albums? Wrong. No songs appear from Wake or Red, so that's just false advertising right there. Only one song appears from ""beat"", and two from ""three of a perfect pair"". The album contains 4 out of the 5 songs from ""In the Court of the Crimson King"", and 5 out of the 7 songs on ""Discipline"". This is really annoying to me because i don't have the complete albums, but I don't want to buy them for the one or two songs I missed. I really don't know why they DIDN'T include anything from Red, as it is a phenomenal album.All this may not matter to you, in which case feel free to ignore it. Personally I would have liked to know that this compilation relied so heavily on two albums."
4,Interesting Read.,"I knew nothing of these two novels until just a few short days ago when I fell for the charms of Nancy Mitford. It was really interesting to learn that both The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate are semi-autobiographical.Both novels were a classic read. Maybe they were a little boring in parts, but then so is life at times. Anyway, I am a huge sucker for love stories, and that's exactly what these were. I absolutely love how Ms. Mitford shows the two different sides of the narrator, Fanny in each novel. It definitely makes the entire book much more heart warming.Overall, it was a challenging, and interesting read. (I even had to consult my dictionary several times for new and interesting words.)"
4,This book is one awesome road tour.,"Having read some of hank's books (including Black coffee blues), this is one sequel that accompanies anyone as one's road gaurd. So far this definitely one of the best of Rollins accounts of people and places in the history of contemporary music. I enjoyed reading and re-reading it!"
3,diary of a madman,this is the first book of his that I have purchased. its interesting to read whats going on in his brain. I have seen both of his bands and attended two of his spoken word shows. I am rather fascinated by his view of life.
1,UP SET,THE CD WAS SCHEDULED TO BE HERE IN MID JULY BUT WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED IT. IT WAS APPLIED TO OUR CREDIT CARDWE ARE NOT VERY HAPPY.
5,I can identify with this book,"This is one of the best written books I have read in a long time!The characters are very real. I can identify with two of them. Faith-, strong,caring of family,desirous of providing a home environment for her family, even though she is confident that it is dysfunctional. The depths of her emotions are unforgettable, like when she said ""you stopped walking beside me and started to walk in my shadow"". The second character I identify with is the inlaw brother, Junior. Junior can see that there are problems in Faith's family, and that his brother possess undesirable habits and is inconsiderate of his wife. I loved the book, I can hardly wait for the next one. I plan to start a collection of her books."
3,Get it on Vinyl too,"Mum make us chill, light candles and drink heaps of red wine. We are out like a light after that. Just kidding. This is certainly danceable stuff and I recommend this is you like Bjork, Sigur Ros or Dada Pogrom. It is kind of light and fuzzy though. You will smile your way through it, right to the cash register."
5,stunning war time exploits of legendary pilot alex henshaw,The exploits of Alex Henshaw are done some fine justice in this book. It highlights testing of dangerous airplanes during WWII and how so many people contributed without mention. any flying fan will trully love this one! A must for aviation fans.
4,Not bad for under $100,"Bought it for under $100 at Amazon after rebate. Good price for a decent printer. Scans documents well. Good software for OCR and printing utilities. The paper output tray isn't quite long enough but I can deal with it. It's very easy to set up- fairly quiet, and the print qualtiy for b&w and graphics seems to be good thus far. Like most other printers in this category- it's plastic, lightweight and rather cheap overall. But it works well for the price. I'm tired of HP's crap...they load way too much software into the startup file- so I'm glad I tried Canon. Thier utility is very unobtrusive. If you can get it for $83 like I did- it's almost disposable if you decide you don't like it after a year."
2,Lacking something,"I usually like travel videos, and the woman who was our tour guide in this one was likeable and knowledgeable, but my interest level was kept lukewarm. Somehow, whatever it takes to make an interesting travel video wasn't happening enough here."
4,England,"This DVD is all about Historic England and less about the touristy attractions. I bought this DVD along with the London City Guide which comes separately and found it most interesting. The places she goes are a bit strange and the weather looks pretty cold, but I guess that's England...cold and dreary most of the year, especially in late Fall. I understand that the Globe Trekker producers are coming out with a new show on England & Wales that they shot in the Spring...I think that's a much better time to visit. This DVD did have many of the places that I have visited though and is a pretty realistic view of what you see. I look forward to the new show."
1,Ick,"This video had the unintended effect of making me NOT want to visit England. They chose the most remote regions of the country and while beautiful and probably interesting, they looked freezing and desolate. The tour guide ate in grubby diners with toothless people, hung out with black mascara loving punks and looked like she was freezing the entire time. There was almost nothing of the pomp and pageantry that most want to see in England. A brief tour of a castle was nice and a scene of battle was interesting. But if you are interested in London in particular, you see basically nothing of the city. If you are seeking info on the Beatles (I wasn't), then you might enjoy this a bit more than I did. I feel like I wasted my money and only learned that if and when I do go to England, there is no way I will go there in late October when its as bleak and dark as a dungeon."
2,made on a color printer,"well the title tells u most of what this is. just a computer printing of the image,lots of pixalation around features on print no copy of artists signature, no copy writemarkings quality of image is that of some thing you would copy & paste then enlarge& print (not the quality of a mass produced print )If I had to guess I would sayit's probably bootlegged & it may be an 80's era ,but was printed in recently"
4,A Useful Teaching Tool,"While this book won't win any literary prizes, it can serve as a useful teaching tool. The reader follows Benny, a young boy, as he learns about the characteristics of living things and classifying invertebrates and vertebrates. I'll use this book in my multi-age classroom as a part of a large unit on living things and animal classification. The explanations and examples in the story are clear and concise. The reader (most likely 2nd or early 3rd grade students) will gain a simple understanding of some important, basic science concepts. This book can easily double as a title for guided reading."
1,Waste of time,I should have realized that some many movies for a low price was not going to be a bargain. I tried a number of times but found it difficult to completely watch any.
1,MUDDY MUDDY MUDDY!,"I'm not sure how Eddie Jobson allegedly ""remastered"" the three UK albums, ""UK,"" ""Danger Money"" and ""Night After Night,"" but they sound AWFUL! Stay away and try to track down the original Editions EG pressings. Anything on Glo Digital sounds atrocious! I'm now stuck with these three horrible discs because the retailer would not take them back since they were already open."
4,Thrills for the Kids and bigger Kids,"What harmony, Kids and Adults will enjoy the Irish Rovers for the very special enjoyment, the accsent of the Irish and the cute animal themes. I too like Whisky on a Sunday... or anyother day."
5,WISH I WERE MORE IRISH,Music is stirring and makes you happy. If you play this music you can throw your prozac away. But it today
2,Pablo Cruise Meets David Sanborn,"As a big fan of both Mulligan's and Piazzolla's works, I was incredibly disappointed by this CD. Recorded in 1974 (need I say more?), the session finds both artists straining to find common ground, periodically relying on cliches that complement the '70s percussion perfectly. This would have made a nice soundtrack for a Starsky & Hutch movie. Mulligan is one of the most versatile blowers that ever lived, but this pairing just didn't work. Yuck!"
2,Overrated,"Sure, these are very talented musicians and yes, there is some amazing musical sequences in this cd, but these moments are rare !Rendes vous 6:02, Nothing to lose and As long as you want me here are poor.There is just two good tracks and they are ""Night after Night"" and ""In the dead of night"", the rest is just below expectations. This cd won't make history."
4,"A good book, if you have had some exposure to SAP.","This is a good introduction to ABAP/4 programming, IF you have some experience in programming in another language AND you're familiar with the SAP environment. It covers most of the basic features of writing ABAP/4 reporting code; it doesn't cover dialog programming or SAPscript, but does have a chapter on BDC. If you aren't familiar with the Workbench -- that is, if you don't know how to create and update programs in the SAP environment -- I would recommend SAMs Teach Yourself ABAP/4 in 21 Days, by Ken Greenwood, as the place to start."
3,"Good for beginners, not for experienced ABAP programmers","I bought this book about two weeks before attending an ABAP training course. It gave me a good introduction to ABAP's commands, which gave me a head start for the class. This book is easy to read and understand for the programming novice. However, it lacks background conceptual information.After taking the course and gaining some additional experience, I realized that this book is very simplistic and does not include many of the important command variations. Perhaps these can be found in the advanced edition of this book, which is soon to be released. Many of the program examples fail to display the most efficient methods of using certain commands. In addition, there are errors in command syntax. I believe you could get the same context quality in a cheaper, paper back publication."
4,Should be a cult classic!,"What a surprisingly fun movie, this is a troma production which means cheesy and somewhat aimless. However the post apocalyptic Beauty cults based on hair color, leave the screen full of half dressed burlesque style women. The women dressed in 50's style garments and garters with foot long lashes and beehive hairdo's remind me of a sexier version of a John Waters film. The women have natural (and very attractive) bodies which is a very refreshing change, they are lovely and lewd. Tasteless good fun. Should be a cult classic!"
2,"Should be called ""Tragic Shell""","I bought this product and another brand (very well known for their chocolate) and did a taste test. The Smucker's brand was quite NASTY! It doesn't even remotely taste like chocolate, and it doesn't harden like the other brand. I love Smuckers Jams & Jellies, but they just don't have what it takes to make this chocolate topping. Smuckers's, please do us a favor and stick to jams and jellies."
3,Not what I expected,"I have been getting into the music of Alex Cline's brother Nels and decided to experiment with this disc. However, after 3 playings, I have at best mixed feelings about it. It sounds not so much like jazz as it does some new age fusion with an element of jazz. One problem is the female singer whose voice and spacy singing style just is not to my liking."
4,Track Listing,"1 Will Oldham: All These Vicious Dogs2 Isaac Freeman: Beautiful Stars3 Michael Linnen & David Wingo: Hottub4 Sparklehorse: Sea Of Teeth5 Michael Linnen & David Wingo: Cantus For Bob Hardison6 Mogwai: Fear Satan (Remix)7 Paul Jones: Goin' Back Hme8 Steady Baker / Pyramid: Body On Fire9 Pyramid: Streets Were Raining10 Michael Linnen & David Wingo: I Wanna Dance 4U11 Mark Olson and Creekdippers, The: Cactus Wren12 Promise Ring, The: Say Goodbye Good"
2,Pyramus and Thisbe,"Essentially the original Rome and Juliet. Two star-crossed lovers who live in adjoining apartments decide to elope. Pyramus takes his life when he mistakingly thinks his true love was eaten by a lion. Thisbe takes her own life soon after, and lo and behold they die together in love. This book is only worth reading as a companion to Shakespeare's a Midsummer's nights dream to explain the ""play"" within the play. A classic theme, perhaps the first of its kind... but a non-worthwhile read if you the story of Romeo and juliet. This Story also offers an interesting explanation of why mulberries are blood red instead of their "" orignal natural"" white."
5,like medicine for your brain,"I was having a Terrible Time last week, and a friend gave me this album. I politely thanked him, but was thinking, ""this is so weird, I'm sure I'll never listen to it.""I have never been so instantly moved by anything before. After about two minutes I looked at him with my mouth open and said, ""I love this music."" It has not been off my turntable since. (it was an LP!!) I listen to it when I wake up in the morning and it gives the most gentle start to my day. I'm convinced that it's doing something very therapeutic for my brain. It's definitely good for the soul. Incredibly soothing, comforting. It's just wraps around your brain and says, ""Easy now, easy easy easy."""
5,GREAT,"I feel rather silly jumping on the Eno bandwagon decades after his best and most influential works were released. But here I am. Burned out on everything else, uninspired by anything new, I find myself going back to Eno again and again. This cd is really great. Simple, easy to listen to ( but certainly not ""Muzak"" )and very relaxing without being boring. Nice to listen to at night before bed, cool in the background when its raining out. And yes, I did actually put this on headphones as I waited for a flight out of Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport."
5,Soothing music for stressful times.,"I may not be frightened of flying, but I certainly have enough fears and stress in my life to warrant something soothing. Music For Airports elicits calm in a way that only the best musical compositions do. It transports you to a peacful state, yet it's still highly listenable. This work has come in and out of my life several times since it was released and it always seems to fit the prescription. I suggest trying it during a traffic jam, an anxious moment, or as a precursor to romance. You won't be dissapointed."
3,Love it or Hate it,"This cd is indeed ambient. It is not to be listened to traditionally or with concentration. Play it, then come and go with the music. After a few spins, you'll know the album. It is very elusive and changes with every spin. I have not in fact had a chance to listen to it in an airport however."
5,exquisite,"simplicity in its own world is the most beautiful of things. This work of music/art is not for everyone and for some is an acquired taste. When I first listened to this, it made me wonder of how inane this is, a piece of music? not now though.the first track uses only 6 chords and is so beautifully pleasing auditory wise that I can say it is the closest you can come to hearing your own imagination. speckled raindrops, sand dunes.This Cd is a kiss in the wind, a wave on the feet, a whisper to innocence, this is music at its best in ways not known to many. exquisite and elegant,uncanny and sophisticated. it is a splatter of stars on a clear night. highly recommended for meditational purposes or deep relaxation. I recently injured myself rather badly and have been stuck with a wheelchair, the only thing that gets my mind of my present troubles is this music. powerful and haunting. a must have ."
4,Wonderful Look at Politics as a Blood Sport,"For those of you who thought the people on Survivor II were a nasty lot, look back a few years to the presidency of Bill Clinton and the wicked group of enemies he managed to amass. James B. Stewart in Blood Sport, the President and his Adversaries, presents a wonderfully detailed look at the people and issues behind the trouble during Bill Clinton's presidency. It is now a little dated but still as important and relevant as the people may changed but politics remains the same. The author attacks in a very clear fashion the main problems bedeviling the Clintons, including often their own arrogance. This book names names and gives a perceptive look the people behind the scenes in politics who spend their time turning politics into the blood sport it has become, and probably always has been. An interesting read."
3,Ummm... is it just me?,"I just don't think this game does justice to the show or the manga. The graphics are pretty good, but the game's overall design reminded me of a certain Inuyasha game for PS2. Also, the audio is even worse than most people admit (I fought the urge to press mute for most of the gameplay).I've probably just been spoiled by the DBZ Budokai games (whose concept is way better) and I guess I wanted something more out of the story mode. Anyhow, it might just be a bad mood, but I never expected to want my money back."
4,Excellent headset,"I've gone through 3 different headsets before this one mostly from Logitech. Each one took a while to get used to as well as find a comfort level since they were behind the neck style headsets. This headset is the first over the head headset I've had and it's incredibly comfortable straight out of the box. The sound in the headphones is excellent. I play a lot online and use Ventrillo. The sound quality from the mic is excellent. I think I've found my headset finally. Now hopefully, my cat won't eat this one.[Update]Still have this headset and love it. It was well worth the price I paid for it. It has proven to be a sturdy little thing as well. I can't count how many times I've nearly sat on this. The noise cancellation is superb. My poor husband has to resort to tossing paper clips at me to get my attention when I'm playing or listening to music."
3,I expected more,"It's not a bad product but definitely not a very good one either. I use it at work for occasional video calls and listening to music. The video conferencing part is fine. The voice quality on both ends is good, however I was satisfied with the voice quality of my previous $20 Logitech headset as well. However, I was willing to spend this much money on this product because I expected that I could get good music quality out of it too. Well, that's not really the case. I'm not an audiophile person so I can't explain why it sounds all flat and dull, but it definitely does.While wearing, it feels reasonably comfortable. It has basically ZERO sound insulation at the padding around my ears. That is a problem in two ways: I can hear the noises in my office while listening to music and other people can also hear whatever I'm listening to. That's annoying."
4,Just What I Wanted,"I needed a new headset for Skype and for listening to streaming music while working. The reviews were positive and I went for it. Works perfect for what I wanted. Comfortable, excellent sound quality. Glad I got them. Satisfied customer."
3,headphones been working great for 4 years but mic broke after 2 months,"It's kindof expected that headphones will only work so long, and these do not dissappoint on that front... it worked as expected for 2 months then broke... I actually still use it 4 years later as a pair of headphones, as only the microphone broke, not the headphones :) for headphones to last 4 years is pretty impressive, but the broken mic = bad news."
3,"My 2nd one, It's defective","Well this is my 2nd pair, my dog ate my first one. I bought it over 2 months ago and I rarely used it except for music. When I finally started using it for gaming I noticed the Left/Right audio was switched. I verified it with the first pair and another pair of sennheiser headphones. Since I was out of the Amazon return period sennheiser wanted me to pay to mail it in, and possibly wait 2 weeks for a refurb. Luckily amazon extended their return policy for me after I explained the situation, and offered to pay for shipping PROPS to Amazon's customer service.tl;dr Buyer beware bad batch and expectation from sennheiser to mail it back in and get a refurb in return. Test the set for Left/Right orientation as soon as you get it."
2,Terrible Mic,"I was so excited when i put on the headset and started listening to my friends talk while gaming. They felt superb and extremely comfortable (which they do feel like). But the major flaw is the microphone. I don't know if it was just me, but the mic was completely terrible and made me sound scratchy and robotic. I would recommend this product probably just for listening to music, but if you're trying to talk to people or go on long skype calls it just won't do.Pros- Comfortable, Great SoundCons- Terrible Mic, Seems Flimsy"
4,great headset.....no noise cancelling.,"So the headset works ad advertised. Is comfortable (wore it all day). I actually use this with an adapter from my cell phone. Cranked up all the way its a little quiet through the cell phone but I just don't think it has enough juice to drive it. But its still works great. I had a wireless set I was using before and I was having to find a meeting room with a land line and I could understand everything perfect that I couldn't with my wireless headset on my cell. Now with this it was clear as day.The only thing was that it does not have noise cancelling and is not even advertised as so on the carton. thats why I took i down a star, with that said i'd still buy it again."
2,I don't like it,"I went to Amazon to read reviews for over 20 headphones with a mic. I bought this one in Fry's electronic today, and I am definitely going to return it today.It is very uncomfortable. The headphones sit ON your ears not around. This results is a painful experience. The headphones are also very warm, and your ears will be sweating a few seconds later. Finally, the mic is a bit far from your mouth, and I could barely hear my own voice. Even the mic of the laptop seem to capture my voice better."
3,A Little Sun In The Gloom,"Cowboy Junkies try to mix things up a little by opening up the drawn shades just a crack and letting some sunlight in. The result is a decidedly uneven affair. Some songs are pretty great, others are just plain boring and nondescript. They still have not matched the melancholy brilliance of The Trinity Session, and it looks like they probably never will."
1,Messermeister Knife Roll,Within a week of my purchase the metal loop for the strap tore. Im going to go with the Ultimate Edge next time.
3,Why It Is PG: Review for Parents,"I wanted to include a note for parents.The movie is OK for kids except for one scene. Claire takes off her dress to reveal a black bra and black bikini panties and jumps on top of David. The scene is shot especially showing Claire's behind. It's a brief scene, but I wish I'd known it was in the movie for the sake of kids."
2,Moon Mullican not at his best,"Ouch this is painful to say, but pass on this CD unless you just want to have everything Moon Mullican did. This CD is was done late in Moon's career and is not his original stuff. It sounds like it Moon, his piano and maybe a guitar player playing in a hotel room someplace. The tape recorder used on this recording in the 1950's is very so so.Moon has so much great stuff, but buy everything else he has out there before this CD>Still its Moon Mullican so that's worth two stars"
2,This gets boring quickly,"This is the only album I have heard. The one song ""Heartwind"" was interesting to listen to but - most of their music is simple and repetitious. I kept wanting them to go someplace with the music. I consider them a curiosity."
4,Jut a bit better than Love Story,"I liked this just a little better than ""Love Story"" because I thought the characters, especially Oliver, were more fleshed out. When Oliver starts to see a psychiatrist to help him deal with Jenny's death, we're able to get into his head and understand his motiviations much better. I found the ending quite sad and maybe a bit overly pessimistic, but it felt real nonetheless."
3,Kind of spendy for what they are.,So far we are very happy with our selection of this product. Would purchase this again. Do your homework so you get what you need for your application.
2,sad,I've listened to a few of red skeltons radio broadcast and they were good but they disc takes some of his non funny momemnts and throws them together it's the worst dvd ever!
1,Disappointing,"Absolutely atrocious writing! Ninety nine percent of the book directly involved the main character Jane Rizzoli. There was marginal direct involvement of the character Warren Hoyt and practically nothing to develop the character of the ""Apprentice"". I found myself questioning many of the situations in the book. They either lacked in originality to the point where the situation was too farfetched to be believable, or the situation seemed to lack any relevance to the general flow of the storyline. The ending was truly disappointing as it both peaked and concluded literally within a mere couple paragraphs.If you want something riveting that will keep you on the end of your seat, keep looking."
4,Critique,"I really ove the TV series and love the books, they follow the story lines of the series very well"
4,A Very Good Sequel,"This book is a sequel to Gerritsen's The Surgeon. It's one year later and another hot summer in Boston. Detective Jane Rizzoli is on the trail of a killer who's crimes bear a similarity to the Surgeon who she helped put behind bars the previous summer. In this outing, the attention centers more on Rizzoli. Her prickly nature is a little off-putting at first, but I grew to like and admire her as the story progressed. I did miss Detective Thomas Moore who played a large part in the previous book. I found myself anxious to resume reading each time I had to put this book down. It held my interest throughout and the action was non-stop. The content is fairly grizzly and might not be for everyone. I would strongly recommend reading The Surgeon before picking this one up. As a sequel, it lived up to all of my expectations. A very good read."
3,Not as good as the Surgeon,"A continuation of the previous novel, The Surgeon, so it wasn't as good nor as suspenseful. Although there was a new killer added to the mix I didn't get the same chill factor as when I read The Surgeon. The technical medical writing is a little lengthy, but I understand that it is Tess's style that separates her from the rest. I don't like Jane Rizzoli nor do I like her family. I think she's too hard on her male coworkers, although I believe Detective Crowe deserves it, and she tries too hard. I tend to feel more embarrassed for her than sympathy."
4,Love the series. Audiobook.,This is an exciting thriller.The book is a good pace and keeps your attention.The narrator was good.I would recommend reading the whole series in order.Although some of the books are better than others.
4,Tess Gerretsen,"she is a fabulous author whom i decided to try. A little too medically graphic for me --- got to have a strong stomach for her readings. However, she surely gets her points across and not ony does she use her medical knowledge [she is a doctor] her writing skills and ideas are a close 2nd to Patterson, however, no one can fill his shoes. I definiutely recommend her books."
3,I didn't find it a brilliant best.,"Gerritson is a talented writer, but you wouldn't necessarily know it from this book. While she manages to keep the pace up, the plotting is sloppy (sudden endings, loose threads) and the characterization feels weak this time around.Hope to see her back with a stronger entry next time."
2,For the Gore Obessed Only,"And I don't mean Al. I was not all that aware of this sub-genre of the cop novel. If lovingly described tableaux of decomposing bodies on the autopsy table or in the field is your favorite dish, then you've found your author. Tess gets right in there with the stench of corpse gasses and the dribbling, squirting liquified putrefaction. You may need a barf bag near to hand when you read this one. What is the deal, people?"
1,Seconds,"The Tank Top's straps that go over your shorders are uneven (one side wider than the other), made in Chuna, seconds"
1,Cult in disguise,"Do not waste your time or money on this book. I bought this book from Amazon and wish I hadn't. The author's writing skills are very poor and it comes through in this book. This book is fiction but the author tries to make you believe it is all true. I would believe that the toothe fairy is real before this book. The author gives no proof in his ramblings that the story is true. Angles,Opes Dei,The king of Spain Juan Carlos,the end of the world, anybody can search the internet and find a million hits with the topics he wrote about with the same conspiracies.If you check the authors web site you will read a bunch of writings saying the end of the world is going to happen very soon. Everyone is going to Hell except the chosen few who read his book, only then will you be saved. This is a cult don't drink the Kool-Aid."
3,5 stars? Nah.,"I am a big downtempo fan, and finally got around to checking out this album, based on its popularity and reviews. The music is ok, but nothing really stood out for me. The track I liked the most was track 11. Check out Bar Lounge Classics - volumes 1, 2 and 3. Great stuff there."
4,enjoyable,"This CD is really great for just having in the background. It's really relaxing, and the songs just have an over all calming effect. I especially like #'s 1,2, and 12. Some of the songs i could do without, but overall, great album"
3,Cozy Chill out album with great vocalists,"Lovers of downbeat electro and lounge will appreciate this cozy album. Put this in the CD player and curl up with a book in your favorite seat. My favorite tracks are ""Destiny"", ""Distractions"" and ""In the waiting line"" who are served with the brilliant vocals of Sophie Barker and Sia Furler. Not surprisingly they all have been singles! I also loved the soulful voice of Mozez on ""Simple things"", ""I have seen"" and ""This world"". The voices give a warm human touch to the electro tracks.The songs alternate with instrumental tracks and the album flows well that way. ""Polaris"" and ""Likufanele"" stand out among the instrumentals for me, while ""Give it away"", ""Red Dust"", ""Out of town"" and ""End Theme"" tend more to get the skip treatment when I'm not in the mood for that type of music. A perfect album to relax and dream on."
5,Low Key Seduction,"It wasn't until the advent of Satellite Radio with its many stratas of niche sites that I couild consistently listen to and identify music such as Zero 7. So I've come to discover this CD at a late date, but it's timeless music anyway. Melodic, moody, sensual, and inspiring, each track brings to mind a daydream or at least a wandering moment on a long drive. Some might label Simple Things as ""elevator music"", as they do with Smooth Jazz. So be it. These songs are meant to relax by, or work along to without being distracting. Glad I found them!"
1,Run don't walk....,"and I mean away! I've heard people compare this record to Air, but Air doesn't suck! The instrumentals are okay for Air rip-offs, but it's the cheesy vocal tracks that really turned me off."
5,Sun on Your Skin,"I love this CD. This was the first Zero 7 CD that I ever had and it is still my favorite although When It Falls has it's moments. I first heard these guys on a compilation CD that I picked up at the library and I immediately knew that I would be buying their stuff. In the world of chill they are standouts for sure. They put the ahhh...in acid. Great vocals and mood creating progressions. I always get this one out when it is time to relax around the pool and really get into some serious lay-back and get-high. This music has a warm, sexy rich texture to it that evokes the feeling you get when the sun is beating down on your skin and you feel like your melting. I Have Seen, Destiny, Simple Things,and Waiting Line are exceptional tracks. Buy it."
5,Easy listening?!,"One of the reviewers called this CD ""easy listening"". Not for me... Actually, this CD is SO GOOD, that I cannot do anything else while listening to it. It just grabs my ear, and forces me to listen to the detailed soundscapes. I think every note is perfectly placed. Actually I find it hard to concentrate on writing this review, as Polaris is now playing on my headphones...A masterpiece."
5,a great cd for down time,"this cd is so chill, its great for when you want to get it on with someone, its relaxing peaceful and nice, its refreshing to have a cd that you can enjoy. What i like most about it is how gental it is, it is a must have for anyone who is stressed!"
3,No match for Air,"I bought this based on all the comparisons to Air, a band I can listen to endlessly. The music is indeed highly similar. Unfortunately, the banal, faux-soulful vocals turned me off completely."
4,A very good movie,This movie is one of the best Anime ones I've seen. Although I was dissapointed about the voice actor changes.
2,"Bad acting, horrible picture quality","The dub of this movie is pretty bad, they get basic things like name pronunciations wrong. And the guy playing ""Kuwahara"" is way too serious in the role of a comedy relief character. To make matters worse, the image transfer here is VHS quality at best and is taken from a pan and scan copy of the movie. Now that Central Park Media has gone under, Funimation will probably release a better version of the film at some point."
1,a random order and incomplete,"I have the double album (2 records) and it's a live recording. Though the order of the recording on the CD is random, totally off from the original and sometimes the songs are not completely recorded and suddenly end. It really takes the joy away to listen to it!"
4,Great way to get an overview of Texas History,"I moved to Texas recently and needed to be familiar with Texas History for a job I was applying for. I bought this volume used, and found it to be a very helpful resource. The book is filled with photographs, illustrations, maps, diagrams, as well as text. It was a pleasure to read -- the pictures really make it a lot more fun. I especially enjoyed the mini-biographical sketches of famous Texans sprinkled throughout the pages. Owning it is like having your own personal museum of Texas history!"
4,"""Plateaux of Mirror"" is better, but still amazing","""The Pearl"" is the second lp recorded by Brian Eno, master of British minimalism, and Harold Budd, the master of the California school. Eno and Budd knew each other well prior to their recordings- Eno produced Budd's amazing ""The Pavalion of Dreams"" lp several years earlier.The pairing couldn't have been better. Budd's music is so broad and spacious that it has been said that one could drive a truck through those spaces. These spaces allow Eno to expertly add his sonic landscapes to the pieces; (""Against the Sky"" is a prime example of this) the results are glorious indeed, as this lp clearly shows.While I prefer their 1st recordings ""Ambient 2: the Plateaux of Mirror"" more, the ""Pearl is a beautifully sublime lp of wonderous textures and soundscapes that transcend anything the lamely coined ""New Age"" movement could ever dream of offering."
1,MST,Be careful when buying a mach speed product. Customer service is non existent. If you email tech support they will reply asking for you to call them. Buying a player like this is a gamble.Save yourself the pain of begging for help and buy a reliable brand like Sony.
2,Hard to use,"Great price but very hard to use, you can spend 15 minutes just trying to escape the menu.Be nice to have better volume control."
1,stupid,yes it is low budget. so what! that doesn't change the fact that it was a piece of junk. i bought it in a five dollar bin and only watched it once. i gave it away and the person i gave it to ended up giving it away. he couldn't even watch the whole thing. if i was an actor in this movie i don't know if i would go around telling anyone i was involved in the film. i wish i never even heard of the film. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! IT'S STUPID BEYOND BELIEF AND YOU'LL HAVE WASTED A FEW HOURS OF YOUR LIFE THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE BACK!
1,You have to rate it with one to rate it at all!,"Ok... so if you want the ""plot"" of this movie read some of the other reviews.If you want to know how much it sucked then read this one. I think all the other reviewers were really too generous in their praise for this film. One of the reviews says watch this movie if you are bored. DONT it will increase your boredom. The stories are rediculous and badly acted [not in that great b-horror shlock kind of way either...if you want that then get killer Klowns from outerspace].I'm not a buff by any means, but I do love horror, all kinds of horror, good bad, great, gory... you name it. But this movie is none of that...it's just boring and disapointing.Don't buy this movie. Please. If you must then rent it.. then write a review like mine and tell everyone how bad it was."
3,Pretty but Color in Photo is not accurate,"I got his paper to cover a coffee can, to try to make my own decorator tins. It's pretty paper, but in the photo, the green looks very muted and barely noticeable. The green on the paper itself is very bright. So much so that it kind of looks like Christmas paper. I used it, but I'm not really happy with it, and will just be extra careful about colors in photos when buying from this company in future. The shipping was fast, not too much packaging, product is good, just not what I expected from the photo."
5,Classical J.T.,"This is one that somebody took track, ""You've Got a Friend"" and forgot the rest. This is an example of why I hate ""Best of"" CD's. ""You Can Close Your Eyes"" and ""Love has Brought Me Around"" are beautiful. I really like this CD!"
2,Misleading description,"This book was described as a trade paperback, but the book that showed up was a mass market paperback. One would figure that a company that sold books would know the difference, but hey, maybe that's just me. The book was in great shape in any case."
1,Wrong item at Amazon,"I ordered this product from Amazon and received a totally different thing, so I returned and got back... another wrong item again! So I returned it again and got my money back. I finally bought it from a different company, and the thing is a beauty itself, it works right away with no trouble at all. However, be aware that Amazon might still have another item labeled instead."
4,Inspiring,"This book is an inspiring account of living a spiritual life in the world as working woman, mother, and wife. I have relied on her stories to go deeper in my own spiritual practice, alleviate my own fears, and recognize the sign posts as I proceed along the way."
4,Great for any fan,"I bought this for my cousin who is a huge fan of Justin Bieber. She absolutely loved it!! She said it was great to hear all the details about how he became a big star. I'm not a fan, but found the story intriguing."
5,excellent book,"This was an excellent book. It was very easy to follow. I have been trying to lose weight ever since my last child ( 21/2 years ago) and had not been successful. I had tried many different diets along with lots of exercise programs but most were very complicated and I ended up making two sets of meals, one for my family and one for me.Then I came across this book it was very easy to follow and made a lot of sense. I had gestational diabetes with my last child and this book is really close to the same diet plan I was put on to control the diabetes, just not quite as restrictive. I can make the same meals for the whole family and just link and balance. After two months I have reached my goal weight and I also feel better and have more energy. This is more than a diet, it is a life style change and is so easy.I highly recomend this book it is wonderful!!!!!"
4,Finally something that works!,"I purchased this book because my 14 year old, autistic daughter kept gaining weight no matter what I did. We tried weight watchers, I took her to a nutritionist, but nothing worked. Finally, I took her to an endocrinolgist who diagnosed her with insulin resistance. After doing some research, I found this book. We started following the diet and the first week, she lost 2 pounds - she has never lost 2 pounds in a week - even on weight watchers! She is now down 11 pounds in about 5 weeks. She even lost 2 pounds while we were on a cruise. What I like is that it doesn't really eliminate anything which is very difficult for an autistic child. You just have to be mindful of the carb-protein ratios. We are finding the diet easy to follow and look forward to her finally reaching a healthy weight."
5,Straight-forward and Understandable,"I've had the book in my hands for a week and am surprised by how much of what I read I have retained. It is written using understandable language and not ""medical speak."" I have read other books on insulin resistance, and I have to say this one is the best so far! It is straightforward, to the point, and offers explanations in lay terms. I've learned so much in the past week about insulin resistance, and it offers workable solutions for how to combat it. I highly recommend this book if you really want to understand insulin resistance."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is full of incorrect diet advice. There were several points that the authors tried to make that do not coincide with actual proven science. In the book the authors claim that fat is not filling. But later claims that you need small amounts for good health. It seems they can't get the information correct. It also claims that eating your carbs with protein is a good for lowering insulin response and losing weight. This to me seems reminiscent of The Zone (a much better book) of eating carbs, protein and fat in balance and limiting all three. My advice is to skip this book with its bad and sometimes blatantly incorrect 'science' and read The Zone or any book by Jack Challem. I have followed these diets and lost not only weight but aches and pains and allergies and gained better mental acuity as well as reversing my insulin resistant state."
3,This is good only for the die hard Lucy fan.,"Contrary to the title, this is not lost ""I Love Lucy"" episodes. It's Lucy and company appearing in various other shows. It's good for a die hard Lucy fan, but it's not what you expect from the description"
5,This cd rules,I love Pink Floyd and have all the albums. this disc is cool and is awesome! While sadly lacking welcome to the machine Why oh why did they not include it. The tracks are all awesome. the bottom line This cd is what every floyd fan should own. It's a good start for people who are new to pink floyd. This wasn't suppose to replace the orginal albums and shouldn't have to.
5,"WHEN YOU DONT HAVE TIME FOR THE WHOLE CD, TAKE THE HITS NOT THE MISSES:-)","THIS IS A WONDERFUL COMPILATION WHEN YOU DONT HAVE TIME TO LISTEN LIKE WE USED TO DO. MADE FOR A DREAMY REMINDER OF YOUNGER YEARS AND TIMES WITH FRIENDS. TAKE THE TRIP AGAIN WITH ""ECHOES"" OF YOUR PAST AND MAKE IT TODAYS ECHOES:-) FROM THE DARK SIDE OF THE (WYOMING) MOON....HA:-) HAVE A GREAT LISTEN:-)"
3,PINK FLOYD IS NOT ABOUT A GREATEST HITS ALBUM!!!,"Echoes is good but not great. The only Real good thing about the album is the liner notes. there are many ""Hits"" that are not on this album like ""Have A Cigar,"" and ""Brain Damage/Eclipse,"" Also they put a couple on there that really did not belong like ""Jugband Blues,"" and ""Bike,"" over all its ok. I would recommend ""Pulse"" or ""Shine On,"" Audio is great, well mixed by James Guthrie."
3,I didn't like the mix of Songs,"I was a little disappointed. The mix of songs is bizarre. First of all, they are not in a logical order. Putting them in chronological order by album would have made sense. Instead the songs are in some kind of random order. Also they put a lot of older Pink Floyd songs most people could care less about. Not enough songs from The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish you were Here and Momentary Lapse of Reason. Also, I think for 26 dollars, you could get 2 CD cases, instead of the bi-fold CD case that always breaks when you try to get the 2nd CD out. Music companies are really cutting corners these days."
5,This is an awesome CD!,"This is the only Pink Floyd CD I have, but it is one of my favorite albums. I don't know what all this whining about the whole thing being one continous track is about, you were all expecting too much. I'm not real big on their early music but I still listen to it, sometimes. The best songs on here are probably from The Wall and The Dark Side of the Moon. Comfortably Numb, Hey You, and The Wall Pt. 2 are my favorites. I do wish; however, that The Wall Part 1 was on here to complete the three part song. The only disapointment I have in the album is the absence of Have A Cigar. I caught on to this song through the Foo Fighters remake and love it. Overall I recomend this album to anyone who has the money to buy it. Pink Floyd is the second or third best British band ever but who come compete with the Beatles or Rolling Stones. In my opinoin at least, they're the best."
5,great album,"yup, sure as heck, this album is everything i couldve hoped for. i own a ton of floyd and still havent gotten my cd library complete. (im still draggin around all my cassettes, live and studio) i forgot this album pulls together a lot of my favs from other works. thanks for having it pop up as a suggestion! it paid off for me and the seller!"
1,:(,"It has some good tracks, but none of it flows! I feel like I am listening to a burn every time I pop it in. Plus my two favorite albums (""More"" and ""Obscured By Clouds"") have no recognition with Echoes, which is a bummer. Most of what you hear you can easily listen to on the radio... If you want ""Another Brick in the Wall"" go ahead and get this junk. If you want ""Cymbaline"" or ""Mudmen,"" then I see where you stand. Echoes gives no justice to Pink Floyd whatsoever. They give it a new identity. Pink Floyd is supposed to be slightly different in every release. This just jumbles everything up in an ugly mess...I am just happy they were wise to include ""Fletcher Memorial Home"" and ""Bike."" Although maybe this wasn't a good move because all these garbage-consuming people want is Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall. I like both albums, but I certainly believe there is more to Pink Floyd than just that."
4,not bad at all,"Being a new fan of Pink Floyd, I'd say this ""Best Of:"" collection is actually quite good. The people behind this spent time on transitions betweens songs and such, and everything melds together quite nicely.Just listen to the transition between ""Us and Them"" and ""Learning to Fly"" -- it's amazing.The music is the most important thing on here though, and you get it in spades. Granted, there's some songs such as ""Young Lust"" and ""Brain Damage"" (and many others) that didn't get treatment, but otherwise, you'll find a very, very solid collection of music on here. Even the packaging is nice.This is probably best for new Pink Floyd fans, or anyone interested in Pink Floyd. You'll find a lot more when you start buying their albums."
3,This rating mainly is for the syd stuff,"I used to like this band alot i listen to dark side of the moon a million times it seems years ago. I also bought this, and the wall. The only good songs on this are the ones that classic rock radio plays a millon times and the syd barret stuff. The syd stuff especailly see emily play is cute and quite enjoyable. Pink floyds songs are way to long and take forever untill someone starts to sing. If i want to listen to instrmentals i would put on one of my bach cds. The other thing i do not like much about floyd is there lead singers waters and gilmor there voices are quite dull. People keep saying that Radiohead sounds alot like this band i agree some what but atleast they do not do long songs and there singer has the better singing voice. Pink floyd fans are so loyal they but all there cds even if they are crap. If floyd release a cd of themselves farting the cd's would be snatch up quickly. I think most of there fans are high when they listen to there music."
3,"Good, but let's not pretend","That some of the Post Roger Waters material is that good to be included in a best of. For that matter Roger's solo material from Amused to Death should be considered because it has such a more superior Pink Floyd feel than the abyssimal High Hopes. (Ughh!) I cannot stop cringinng when hearing this Britney Spears type Pink Floyd (Way too contrived and not very good at that) Not to mention the even more horror show of Keep Talking. It seems they were scratching their heads watching 2001 A Space Oddesey like the Monkees in the movie to come with a Pink Floyd type song. The monkees would've have done much better. If they have litgitimize this era of Pink Floyd where is On the Turning Away? or What do you want me to do? Songs that have a much more Pink Floyd sound.Aside from that it covers as much as they could, but I could've still made much more genuine."
5,"If you only could have ONE Pink Floyd Disc, this is the one.","Most would think that would be DSOTM. It's a close call. But, since this set has most of the best cuts from DSOTM, and the best cuts from every other release, this would be my choice.Disc 2 of this set has been my bedtime CD for over a year now.Only two comments. I could do without ""Bike"". That song just creeps me out, especially the freaky noise at the very end.Secondly, I'm disappointed that they cut Gilmours Blues solo in SOYCD.I still give it 5 stars though.EDIT: BTW... If you are a guitar player, there is what is probably one of the best TAB books ever produced for this album. It covers every song, exactly, and has every Gilmour solo.http://www.amazon.com/Pink-Floyd-Echoes-Best/dp/0757908039/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-3072233-2244740?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1184174143&sr;=8-2Unfortunately, it is out of print so you will have to go with a listed used copy.I'd get it while you can."
2,Another failed attempt at a greatest hits collection,Who decides what songs to put on these greatest hits compliations? They need to have someone not associated with the band pick the songs. They left so many songs off that should have been here that they're too numerous to mention. Some that are here I don't want to hear again. I'm putting my copy up for sale on ebay tonight.
2,Have High Hopes,"A Best Of by Pink Floyd, as lovely as it is to get all their ""best songs"" into two discs, just doesn't work, especially when the songs are out of chronological order; instead of fading in and out nicely, the compilation ends up being something like the jumbled blocks of a bad Tetris player, so the effects of the songs are different than from the original albums. The only good thing about this compilation is the artwork. If you don't have any Floyd albums Dark Side of the Moon will suffice just as good or even better."
5,Big Floyd fan but box set could have been better,"The songs on this cd were all good but there should have been some live performances and some more songs in general. Also, a story booklet about the formation, success and fall of the band would have been nice too, most people probably wonder why Roger Waters is such a strange person. The live versions of Mother, Young Lust, the rare version of pigs on the wing and the normal version of goodbye blue sky would have been nice as well."
2,"Buy Floyd's albums, not songs","Although this album has some great songs, I recommend buying their albums, not their individual songs. The meaning is lost on songs from ""The Wall"" and ""Animals,"" among others, because the entire album is more like one song, telling a story. Each song, like ""Comfortably Numb"" and ""Mother,"" are only segments of these terrific pieces of art, so it appears that the songs have no meaning. And even if you disagree, where are other classic hits, like ""Dogs?"""
1,Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd,This is for the new Floyd fan. It is good to get them aquainted with their music.Some of the songs are not in their entirety. Echoes is shortened. Marooned is shortened. Shine On You Crazy Diamond is shortened.One bright spot is that When the Tigers Broke Free from The Wall movie appears.
5,"Chilling, Fast paced and Original","In a remarkably original and fast-paced plot, a series of seemingly unrelated murders slowly unravel themselves. It will be an injustice to a potential reader to give any specifics regarding the plot, lest it reduces the suprise elements of the plot. The twists and turns in the plot are well timed and it seems they couldnt have come a moment too soon or too late. The characters are developed very well over the entire novel and are dealt with considerable depth to make them look very original and human. The narrative style is brisk and never seems artificial...A terrific read!"
4,Great book that was a fast read.,"This was the first book I've read by Tess Gerritsen. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was a bit taken back by the Thornbirds feel it had at the ending between the main character and the priest. But overall, it was an enjoyable mystery."
4,Great Book,"I started reading this book on a Sunday 6pm. I was through with it the next afternoon and I didn't miss work. It will grab you and not let you go, so fair warning. Check with your boss to see if its ok to read at lunch and on breaks. The only complaint would be the beginning is much better than the ending, but only slightly. She paints a picture in vivid detail that gets less vivid as the finishing touches are put on it."
4,Kindle Version,I love the Rizzoli and Isles books. My only problem is that when I bought this book the dotes that show the chapters were not there and the cover was not what I was expecting. It was just the name of the book and publisher. No picture like shown. I was very disappointed. Other wise a good book.ps if anyone knows if this is just a glitch or something pls let me know.
1,I wouldn't buy it again!,"Having been somewhat seduced by the corporate hype, I expected a lot better than what I got. the software doesn't read half my files....is slower on the internet than the previous OS. Trying to sort and move files around is a bloody nightmare on occaision....certainly not straightforward nor simple. It doesn't recognize certain photo or video formats. I don't really understand who this was configured for?? It's back to XPS for me."
2,It's not HORRIBLE but many things will no longer work.,"Vista 64-bit home premium came preinstalled on a new laptop. I purposely selected this option because I wanted a laptop that would be current for about five years. Have used it for about 6 weeks now and it's not as difficult to use as I thought it would be. However, yesterday I ordered a new desktop -- NOT with Vista 64-bit. Am tired of having to upgrade fairly new software just for Vista 64, tired of not being able to hear streaming music, not being able to use my Slingbox, not being able to see certain HTML effects, and not being able to get help for any of this. I also needed something that would work with my other hardware such as printers, scanners, etc. for which there are no Vista 64-bit drivers. By the time Vista 64-bit is ready, five years will likely have passed. Don't buy this unless you're running something that truly needs it or you have another PC that you can count on."
3,key code,The 64 bit windows works fine the problem with it is the key code will not be accepted for the $9.99 upgrade for windows 7 which defeats the reason i got it in the first place. If u just want the windows 64bit upgrade it's fine but if u want it so u can also upgrade to windows 7 for $9.99 then forget it.
3,"OK, but not his best","I rate this CD in the middle of Eno's works. It is not as enjoyable as Music For Airports or his projects with Harold Budd. The music seems contrived and it is difficult to follow. If I had the choice, I would pass on buying this CD."
5,Do you love adventurous books?,"If you like books about adventure, then The Grizzly, written by Annabel and Edgar Johnson is for you.A young boy named David finally gets to meet his dad Mark. Mark takes David to a fishing trip at Trappers Creek. Mark teaches David how to fish, cook, and lots more. While their there something suddenly goes wrong. Trapped in the middle of nowhere? What will they do? How will they get home? What happens while their there? Answer these questions by reading this magnificent book.I would recommend this book to all my friends because it is very adventuress. We give this book five stars because it gives good detail and gives good information.By Kelby & Erin"
2,From the UK?,"I didn't see in the info when ordering, that this was coming from the UK. And I didn't notice the ""region"" warning. I've never heard of that. Of course I can't play the DVD, so it is useless to me. Zoverstock will reimburse me, however, I have to pay shipping. I'll check it out, but if it is more than my initial cost, I won't return it. I'll just toss it. I'll now know to read for ""region"" warnings.I wondered why it took nearly a month to receive it.Thanks anyway."
1,This movie is laughably poor,"And even worse, it has already been done before in ""Phone Booth,"" with Colin Farrell.Can we really be expected to believe that everyone and their brother knows where to go to a hot dog stand in broad daylight to buy drugs? Can we really be expected to believe that it took, like, 45 minutes for an ambulance to be brought to an officer?Snipes lines seemed.......labored. I don't know if it is because it was out of character for him or if the writing was really just that bad.Whatever the case, this movie went right into the trash after being viewed. I am out of CNY2 (US$0.33). Not the end of the world.I know that the authors were trying to make a point about gun control, but I had a hard time staying awake long enough to consider it."
4,Barefoot in Paris,This is the 5th one I have given as a gift. A great cookbook with recipes that have broad appeal.
1,Disappointing!,"Usually, Ms. Garten provides stellar recipes; however, ""Barefoot in Paris"" is about as bad as it gets. Her cooking times are optimistic at best and it appears that she presumes everyone has a each tool made available from Williams and Sonoma. Do yourself a favor and avoid this book, it's hack-y at best. Her recipes are neither easy nor could be made at home (unless you happen to timeshare with Gordon Ramsay). Bobby Flay's offerings are far better than Ms. Garten's misguided book."
2,Simply Boring,"Just plain, lots of photographs and little substance.Won't add anything new or usefull if you are a skilled cook."
3,Great in theory,"I love reading Ina Garten's cookbooks. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the same stores she does, so I have trouble recreating her recipes. I like to use them as a basis for a good dinner. This book will give you some great ideas for a French meal"
5,A Sentimental Murder: Love and Madness in the Eighteenth Century,I bought this book to use as back-up material for a college class research paper. Was in excellent condition when I got it and proved to be very useful.
4,"If you need more pop block, use lycra.","This product gets the job done and the price is very decent. However, if you're in need of some major plosive protection, I've noticed that lycra works better. Metal preserves the trebles and clarity, but lycra will work better for your P's and B's."
3,Pay attention.,"This is a good product for the price. However, pay special attention. This is the metal screen type and not cloth. If that's what you want, it's exactly that. Lightweight with a good clamp."
5,bliss,"Penguin cafe orchestra does it wonderfully and with style. Its like no other music you've ever heard before. Beautiful, rhythmic melodies beg for dancing, and make the listener feel great. ""Air a Danser"" is one of the most wonderful songs i've ever heard...like summer rain."
1,Low quality video and sound,"The quality of video and sound of this DVD set is low like of its VHS original of 1992. A much better is the newer set titled Hermitage Masterpieces of 2004, which was remasterd."
3,Masterpiece,"Wonderfull viewing of inside of great..voice over could be improved, but timing was good. Would recommend if not able to visit St Pertersburg"
4,working well so far,"We bought this harness for our 30 lb Welsh Corgi. He fits into it fine and it helps keep him from choking himself on walks. My only complaint is with the dog - he can get so much more leverage with this as opposed to his collar, and could be walking me if I allowed him. Again, that's a complaint with the dog, however. :)"
4,Burst and Bloom,"Five songs that are much more individually stunning than the rest of Cursive's work. Although these songs are very good, I do enjoy Cursive's 2 most recent LP's more.The first 3 tracks would have to be the better side to the album with 'Sink to the Beat' leading the pack as far as standout tracks are concerned. If you are already a fan of Cursive's other work buy this and keep supporting a great band. Otherwise, check out The Ugly Organ or Domestica first."
2,I must be missing something,"I have been a drummer for some time, and try to appreciate all forms of music even if I don't prefer the style. This DVD is 100% not my style, but I still cannot get past the cheesiness of the whole thing. This is just a bunch of guys hanging out playing together and having the camera run. This is the kind of stuff that people watch and then sit down at a drum set and start banging away and think they are a drummer. Maybe on a Saturday morning in the late 1980's this would have been a little better, but this DVD does not pass the test of time. There are too many other, much better things out there to watch and get inspired from."
4,Does What is it supposed to,"This unit does what it is designed to do, lift the receiver off the phone when a call comes in so you can use the wireless headpiece. It is a little gimicky though, as it sticks to the phone with 2 way tape. I had problems when it lifted the receiver that the receiver would then fall right off the base of the phone so that when you wanted to hang it up, you had to put it back on with your hand, but I fixed this problem using one of the parts that were included with the headset lifter. If you have a phone that is not at a high angle, but is a little flatter, you will not have this issue"
3,Plantronics HL10 Telephone Handset Lifter,"I have not received this product which has been ordered accordingly, therefore, I can not comment on this equipment."
1,Not for those who sit at their desk all day.,"For those who are away from their desk mulling around the office, this will work fine. However, if you spend your day at your desk making and receiving phone calls, this is not a good solution. To lift and lower the handset, you need to press the button on the headset. This gets irritating, and painful, quickly when what there should be is a button on the lifter to press instead or in addition to pushing the button on the headset. Unfortunately, this is going back and I'm going to use my manual handset lifter that I purchased years ago instead."
5,Beautiful and mellow,"Paul Desmond is my favorite saxophonist, and this is my favorite album. It is mellow and melodic - a perfect relaxing, nighttime album. It does not have any of the experimentation with meter or various orchestration of his earlier albums with Brubeck or the quartet. It is just Desmond playing simple tunes with long solos. And this version of Bewitched, the last song, always lifts my spirits with its simplicity and happiness."
5,Finding Humor in Tragedy,"If you are a person like me, a person who does not smile or laugh easily, then this book is for you! There are not to many things I find amusing but Bryson's book "" Hey Dorothy..."" is funny, amusing, a quick read, not a complicated story, but a simple tale. If you are also a fan of the Wizard of Oz, of which I am not, you will get a kick out of the satire, and the obvious parallelism with Dorothy, her friends, and the plot of the story. I read this book twice, the first time not realizing its full potential right away; the second time I kept finding new things to compare between the old Oz and the new. To the casual reader, this may seem like a simple story, which it is taken on the surface, but when you really delve into the story, it becomes quite unique and amusing, with a happy ending for all (what a romantic I am!). It was, I am sure quite a feat, for a first novel, for Ms Bryson to write such a unique tale"
1,give me a break,"notwithstanding the other reviews, when i put this on my player i had to check to see if it was functioning properly. rarely have i heard such a cacophony described as music. pure noise."
3,"Very funny, not PC...","We love the Corfu books by Gerald Durrel and hoped this was more of the same. It is similar but not quite the same. Still, some very funny moments. He is rather old fashioned with his descriptions of local residents.... that wouldn't fly today."
4,Another Great Album!,"If you don't already know about this band, you should. This band is amazing and they are due to break out at any given time. Nuno Bettencourt is a musical mastermind, a brilliant musician. If you're a fan of his work with Extreme or his solo album ""Schizophonic"", you won't be disappointed with this record. Although it's not as strong as their self-titled debut, this is a very good album from start to finish. The remixes of ""All Automatic"" and ""Air That U Breathe"" are worth the price alone! My favorite tracks are ""Space"", ""No Regrets"", ""Monkey Paw"", ""Furnished Souls For Rent"" and ""War Paint"". A must have for any fans of hard rock..."
1,Misleading,"The picture showed multiple coin purses and since it was $6.39 i was expecting multiple coin purses. Upon receiving it, it was only one and its around the size of your palm. I understand they want to show variety but they should also have a picture of just one and maybe let us choose the style."
4,macho gabor szabo,I love this guitarist i have almost all his albums. He is very unique. This one is more funky then some maby because of bob james. try it youle like it.
2,"Beautifully filmed, but lacking insight","This documentary gives a wonderful, albeit brief, view of the landscape and people of Tibet. The photography was magnificent, capturing at once the beauty of the countryside and the incredible spirit of the Tibetan people. However, having been to Tibet myself and witnessed many of their religious ceremonies, I found the performances by Paul Horn intrusive and inappropriate. I wondered who gave him permission to ""perform"" during the sacred ritual chanting of the Buddhist monks. It detracted a great deal from the spiritual significance of these ceremonies. Also, there was no mention of the political atrocities the Tibetan people and culture have experienced as a result of the Chinese occupation. Overall, I did not find this documentary to be an accurate representation of Tibetan culture and religion."
1,Expected Better,"Would not recommend this for any child. The only thing that he/she would be able to see ""up close"" would be insects - big ones. The toy is very cheap feeling and looking. It does not mount to anything and looks like it is missing parts. I would not ever buy this item again."
4,Surprisingly good and full of unpredictable twists and turns,"I truly expected this movie to be the very definition of a ""B"" movie with a mediocre cast and shoddy dialog. Surprisingly the movie was a moderately good thrill ride full of twists and turns which leaves you shocked and appreciative of the thought put into the ending. I liked it alot."
2,Cat and mouse revenge game TV movie style,"A shrinking violet type hears the voice of her rapist on an open forum radio program and begins to plan retribution. Author Emma Brookes keeps the plot moving and generates some suspense, but the contrivances will create far more chuckles than gasps. Weightless and formulaic made for tv style fluff."
3,Spooky,"My family is a little spooked by the tree face. It probably needs to blend into the back, color wise, a little better. However, my grandkids and I like it!"
5,Husband's Choice,I told my husband that I wanted a new perfume. He got me Baby Phat Goddess for a Christmas present. I thought he chose well. It's not overpowering and it has a sexy scent. The other reviews are right though...I couldn't tell that I was wearing anything after awhile. But if my husband likes it on me than I'm going to keep reapplying.
3,Deserves the attention of the modern generation,"Two years after the end of the Second World War, five Norwegians and a Swede captured the imagination of the war-weary world, as they sailed a balsa raft from Peru to Polynesia, to prove that Thor Heyerdahl's theory that Polynesia was settled from South America was possible. The science was weak, but the courage of the voyagers amazing.Winner of the 1951 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature (Norway's only feature film Oscar). Sixty years later the single narrator and the blurry black and white film may seem old-fashioned. But the adventure was still amazing. Thor Heyerdahl was famous to an earlier generation. He and his message about the universality of the human spirit deserve the attention of the modern world."
5,Bernard,"Excellent story, one would appreciate it more if one spoke Spanish! In fact,that is a necessity to fully appreciate the story. Next book should insure translation to English of most Spanish used."
4,Very good book,"Very nice story, easy to read.Full of action with some sentimentality.I would say the book is missing someintensity for the reader to anxiouslywant to turn to the next page"
1,Disappointing,I could not connect with the main character. She is abrasive and obnoxious. The concept might be similar to the Stephanie Plum character but not at all alike. There was no real character development. I could not finish this book. I ended up deleting it from my library.
4,good but soon to be outdated,"Everything you need to know about v.1.3, but with Apache 2.0 just around the corner (currently in beta), you might want to hold off until the 2nd edition. This edition touches very briefly on 2.0, providing a general overview of what to expect, but no meat. A lot remains the same, but some critical things are different, and clear documentation of the kind that this book provides for 1.3 is scant. Hopefully something will come out before too long fill the void.Of course, Apache 1.x is no slouch, has the majority share of servers on the web currently, could be all you need and more. If you're inclined towards the tried, tested, and true, and shun the unproven, consider this a 5 star recommendation for an excellent book on an excellent, if somewhat venerable, web server."
5,5+ stars,"This is an incredible translation and commentary. Rabbi Basser does a wonderful job forming the commentary from Maharal's ""Derech Chaim"". He takes Maharal's ideas and makes them accessable for most people. Once again Artscroll puts out a beautifully bound book with incredible scholarship. As with many of their works I think this one will go down as an important work in the history of Judaism."
1,"Garbage in, Garbage out!","I have no idea what this woman was talking about. She appears to me to be someone who escaped from a mental institution and has multiple personalities. Who is she; Esther, Jerry or Abraham? People who hear voices that aren't there, give me cause for alarm. She was all over the place with her thoughts and comments and made no sense at all to me. I am very grateful that I couldn't understand her, because I NEVER want to relate to her in any way, shape or form. How could anyone possibly give this rambling, mindless video 5 stars? Thank God (or ""Source"" as she says) that this was only a Netflix rental and not a permanent purchase that I would permanently own."
3,Channeling is not my cup of tea BUT,"I like ""Abraham""/Hicks teaching a little more than the ever so harsh and materialistic ""Secret"".This stuff does work. I publish books that the authors Hicks and the producer of the Secret ""borrowed"" from. There is a catch however; the Universe cannot be used as an ATM. There is a reverse blow when you manifest. What does this mean? It means that there is a cost for everything. Oh yes, if your karma would not allow manifesting something it won't work. periodAMNMurine Press"
4,Great Movie,"I enjoyed the plot. Even though I'm not a fan of moview with strong profanity, this movie touched my heart. I was left wanting to know more about this ""girl"" so i watch the 2nd and 3rd movies. Very well written!"
5,True to the book and engrossing,"I'm so happy I was able to see this film, as it was intended, not the horrid Hollywood remake. I highly recommend this."
2,Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is hard to follow,"I've read all three books by this author and loved them all. In fact I got hooked on them. I looked forward to watching the video but was very disappointed because the subtitles were so long, it was hard to watch the action. I ended up falling asleep and I really have no desire to go back and watch it again. I think I'll wait until the American version comes out and purchase that."
4,Intense. Visceral Experience.,"I watched Amazon's Video on Demand (Englished subtitled version).The movie was compellingly developed, the two main characters (Michael and Lisbeth) engaging, and most of the action devoted to intellectual crime-solving of a long-buried murder case. The plot moves quickly and suspensefully. There are a few extremely violent and graphic scenes which were disturbing for this reviewer though they clearly fit with the individual cases and the general theme. Lisbeth, though detached and aloof apparently as a consequence of her childhood, is portrayed clearly enough to engage the viewers' empathy and respect.The Video by Demand process worked pretty well with a few interruptions, less than 1 minute (I took them as built-in commercial/break times.) Video quality on my computer was fine. Sound via aurvana X-Fi headphones was excellent."
4,Sexy Beasts,"A nice movie of an investigative journalist and his assistant -a bi-sexual girl with a dragon tattooed on her whole back- hired to solving a forty-year-old mystery of a disappeared young female, a member of a rich clan in rural Sweden, disclosing intentionally or by-a-way racist anti-Semitic mafia realities of this so high-flying kingdom, and such a rare revelation added, perhaps, to the work's hit status worldwide.It is a really nice low-budget film sliding into a fair-tale at the end, at least a dramatic rescue of a journalist and his later voyage to Australia while awaiting a start of a jail term sure examples of are."
4,Entertaining,"I found this movie to be enjoyable. If you're tired of the same Hollywood type movies, you'll find this refreshing. The characters were interesting, actors were great, and the plot was engaging enough for me to give it 4 stars. My female friends who accompanied me did not find sexual violence in this movie to be disturbing as some reviews say but if you're sensitive, this movie may not be for you."
4,I enjoyed it!,"I enjoyed this movie very much! I heard the buzz about it, heard there was a Hollywood version coming, read the reviews here and decided I just had to see it! I went to Netflix to have it mailed to me and it was available to watch it instantly! Even better! I see some have reviewed saying the book was better... No kidding!!! The books are ALWAYS better! I love a great read. I will not be reading them however, because I found some parts of the movie to be a bit slow, now that's just a bit. I can only imagine how many chapters drag on. All in all I enjoyed it and look forward to the other two movies."
3,"Haunting, Interesting, at first, and then, the fizzle","This movie kept me intrigued and satisfied as the protagonist, a investigative reporter who is facing jail for libeling a billionaire (would not happen in the US), is hired to unravel what happened to Harriet of the rich Vanger family several of whose members were infected by Nazism. Despite strong performances by the protagonist and, the girl with the dragon tattoo, the movie lapsed into a tired cliche of finding a serial killer in a convoluted, contrived plot that left me cold. Perhaps I lost something in the translation, but the ending was doubly contrived and left me perplexed."
5,awesome!,"Didn't know anything about ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" Saw a lot of ads. Became curious, found this version on Amazon and OMG move over ""Silence of the Lambs"". Great movie! Great Acting. Worth watching a second and even a third time."
1,Dispointed,"I was sooo excited went i found this movie,seen sooo many preview's about it...An again it wasn't in English,had to read at bottom of screen everything they were saying...Couldn't even get into this movie at all...:("
1,WARNING: Severe Rape and Violence!,"I could kick myself for only reading 1/8th of the book before watching this film recently at an arthouse movie theater. I had NO idea that there would be DISTURBING and TRAUMATIC rape scenes and sexual abuse in addition to the subjects of child molestation, incest, and child rape. Plus, the gruesome and graphic murders of young women are all included in this movie. There is one scene that shows you all the pictures of the women's dead and murdered faces. Absolutely horrible. It's been several days and I am still traumatized by the violence and have absolute NO interest in finishing the book. I do not understand the fascination of this book or wanting to make a Hollywood version of it. Rape? Child molestation and incest? No thank you! And please change the title of this book and movie back to its original, which is much more appropriate in describing what the subject matter is: ""Men Who Hate Women."""
5,wow did they get this right~,they really nailed this movie perfectly...adapting it wonderfully from the book...they took out what they needed and matched the rest perfectly! i loved this as much as the book~
5,this need to bigger,This was a great move. I feel Americans need a taste of this movie. I would like to see the film remade in English language and placed in the movie theater.
4,Gritty Girl will haunt you,"Based on the best-selling book by Stig Larsson, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a fascinating thriller that that will have you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out what happened to young Harriet Vanger so long ago. On top of that, it is a film filled with compelling characters brought to life by some truly unforgettable performances.[...]"
4,Very Close to the Book,"Like many I loved the 1st book, have read the 2nd, and look forward to reading the 3rd. Bought this video because of all the good reviews and since viewing it I have to agree. Liked the fact that you could view with subtitles or dubbed - watched it both ways. In short anyone who loved the book will love this movie."
3,Not What I had Hoped: Still Decent,"Many times the problem that comes with basing movies on books is that books are still entertaining with lots of exposition. Filmmakers have a choice of leaving that information in and having it be boring or taking it out and ruining the plot. At over 2 hours, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo suffers from both.The most glaring loss was Erika and Mikael's relationship. That relationship defined a lot of who Mikael was as a character and might make a lot of people feel differently about him because of it. Plus Lisbeth's motivations at the end of the movie were different and less realistic than the book.I felt myself simply waiting for the brief action sequences rather than enjoying character interactions because in a movie watching people talk about other people that have been dead for 30 years isn't as exciting on screen as it is in a book.[Edit: Grammar, Phrasing]"
1,Not at all like the book!,"When I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. The plot and the character dynamics intrigued me. From start to finish, the book was amazing. I was anticipating the film to be much like the book - however it seemed more like a complete rewrite. So many events were different from the book it was annoying. The actors are nothing like the book describes them. I haven't read the second or third books yet but soon will. I will NOT be watching the film adaptations for the last two in the trilogy. Very disappointing!"
1,Avoid Music Box Blu-rays,"Do not buy Blu-rays from Music Box films. They begin each disk with many, many previews that you cannot skip by. I have tried everything I can think of, but you're just locked into watching them all every time you insert the disk. This is infuriating, and the only way to send a message to these people with no consideration for their customers is to boycott their products. I bought the disk; it's mine; I want to be able to watch whatever I want to watch when I want to watch it."
4,Loved it!!!,"This is the original Swiss movie and I found it intense, smart and suspenseful. You have to read the sub-titles but the movie is riveting. The acting is very, very good and believable. This movie is about a girl names Lisbeth, who is used and abused by a rouge government system in Sweden. She is tough survivor with street intelligence and a genius IQ. She is a bisexual, fearless, resilient chic and dresses in punk gear sporting a Mohawk. If you like movie's that makes you think and are full of mystery and suspense, you will enjoy this movie. There are some graphic and disturbing scenes of rape and then the act of avenge and revenge of the rape."
4,Surprising,"I kept seeing this movie title pop up on several lists and never took the time to watch until now. Although some of the things the main characters experienced are not for the faint of heart I still was interested in watching until the end. I am assuming this was based on a book, but would admit I would not want to read it because that verision would differently leave me with nightmares."
2,gratuitous rape scenes,"A rather forgettable serial killer movie. The thing that's always gonna stick out in my mind, though, is that in the first half of the movie there are three very brutal and graphic rape scenes that had nothing to do with the plot and could have easily been dispensed with. Really ruined the movie for my family."
5,So much more than just a digital camera.,"I just got this camera for Christmas. I hate reading directions, so I popped the battery and memory card in and I was off! Very user friendly, and has all the right options. Plus, its about the size of the average cell phone. The coolest thing about the powershot is that it knows which way you're holding the camera, so if you hold it vertical to get a tall shot, the viewer turns all by itself. I also love that you can edit video on the camera and set up slide shows. Its very easy to load pics onto my computer with the USB connection - or to set up a slide show for the TV. It even holds voice memos and has cute sound effects when I take pictures. This is really a great camera."
5,Worth buying it used.,There is so little on Schwitters. At least we have this video and a few other things. A great great artist.
5,Brava!,"""Classics,"" will surely delight Brightman fans! It is about time she releases a new recording although I wasn't expecting a 50:50 compilation/new release. Nevertheless, the new tracks surpassed my auditory satiation. ""Nessum Dorma,"" ""Ave Maria,"" ""O Mio Babino Caro,"" are my all time favourite arias. Why on earth Brightman left out Manon's ""Sola Perduta Abandonata"" or Cio-Cio San's ""Un bel di Vedrimo""? They will be great additions to the recording and further her voice, a magnificent blessing gift from God.If you're an avid opera rightwing, give Brightman a chance and you will see she has a great respect for this genre that she makes our all time arias into new interpretations. Brava!"
5,Wonderful,Great CD with wonderful music. Highly recommend for Sarah Brightman fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Recommend checking out her DVDs. They are absolutely fantastic on BOSE!
4,Good but...,"Originally released in November 2001, ""Classics"" is a 15-track compilation of Sarah's best classical vocal work, mingling her favorite classics with seven new recordings. The new recordings are very nice indeed, but the only reason I took off one star is that eight of the songs...in particular ""Time to Say Goodbye (Solo Version)""...are the same as when they appeared on their original albums. I give it four stars nevertheless due to well-timed work and because of the respect I still have for Sarah B."
5,Beautiful Recordings,"This is my first Sarah Brightman album so I really can't compare it to earlier albums, but I find it wonderful. She has an amazing and versatile voice and really shows it off in this collection. ""Ave Maria"" is a great song and Sarah pulls it off with pleasent results. ""Winter Light"" is another pretty song and like ""Ave Maria"", it's not performed in her typical opera voice. ""Pie Jesu"" is yet another highlight. My favorite opera-style songs would have to be ""O Mio Bambino Carro"" and the fantastic closing track ""Time To Say Goodbye."" Ms. Brightman sounds great on both. This is a good CD to relax to. The vocals are fantastic and go great with the orchestrations. Definitely worth checking out."
4,My God.....,...wow...I was just over listening to the samples of her Christmas album which featured the untrained breathy voice of a 12 year old. Then I decide to see what she sounds like normally and I get opera-soprano-mature woman with amazing pipes. Was she sick while recording the other album? Talk about day and night! More of the adult singer and less of the kid I think. Not bad at all.
1,there's no accounting for taste,"if this is singing, then being alive isn't that wonderful. the woman has no voice, can't carry a note, etc. all i can hear is a bunch of 'eh, eh, ah, ah.' if you think i'm giving her a bad review, you should read what some of the music magazines have to say.0 star, of course."
4,Pictures are not worth a thousand words,"I was first introduced to Sarah Brightman a few years ago on PBS, but never bought any of her music. Imagine my delight when I received her Classics CD from my mother-in-law for the Holidays (she had learned that I enjoyed her voice). Now imagine my horror when I saw the CD cover! My 67 year old mother-in-law thought I liked ""naked-lady"" music! Anyway, Sarah's choices for her ""best of"" CD are simply wonderful. However, if you buy this CD, hide it from your children and your mother-in-law, or be prepared to answer some tough questions!"
5,Truly beautiful,"Maybe it's my new hearing aid or attitude adjustment, but the songs are truly beautiful and show off Sarah's magnificent, multi-octave range and vocal styles. My husband and I traveled from Austin, TX, to Dallas last year to hear Sarah perform live at Smirnoff's for her ""La Luna"" concert and did not regret one minute of the trip. I only hope Sarah's next tour includes Austin so I can be first in line for tickets. I have already ordered several MORE copies for Christmas presents. Sarah deserves her rave reviews, this one included."
5,Beautiful and Classical,"This album is the best of Sarah Brightman, and she sings all of the favorites in the classical world, and with complete perfection. This album contains most of the best of her, and I recommend buying this first. This is an excellent, grand album."
2,Not Worth The Price,"Okay, go to the store and buy a cheap peppermint mouth spray. They're about one American dollar. Now, go home, add green food coloring, and presto! Irish Accent Mouth Spray!"
3,Obviously Not real,I just want you everybody to know that THS DOES NOT CHANGE YOUR VOICE but it is a good breath mint spray
1,Had no effect at all,Not sure what else to say. I followed the instructions and tried it 4 times and my tub is still just as clogged as it had been.
3,mini volcano,"this product created a mini volcano -- sort of like a science experiment in my sink. the catch is that i could have done the same with baking soda and vinegar! what really cleared the sink was using the plunger, not the chems, so i advise you buy the plunger only (though your kids will enjoy the volcano if they're watching)"
2,not what I expected,"They don't really look the same in person. They look matte online but they're shiny like patent. I like the matte look better. Also, I ordered 8M but I was sent 8W so they don't look as neat on my feet. They'll have to do...besides when you are an international customer, returning stuff is just too expensive."
4,Great Comedy,I found this movie very entertaining and enjoyable. It wasn't too over the top and owen wilson and vince vaughn have great chemistry.
2,Wedding Crashers,"A DVD which I should have rented instead of bought. Fun and games, in very very light and sexual manner, but definitely not a keeper. Not worthless, but not worth keeping. I am passing it on.Linda Sheean"
3,It's ok,"This is a pretty good movie. Sadly though, I didn't find the two lead actors funny at all. I found them to be obnoxious and I can't for the life of me figure out why any woman would want anything to do with either one of them. They're not even good looking. However, what saves this movie is the bizarre family they get trapped with for the weekend. Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams and Jane Seymour save this movie."
2,Wedding Crashers,"I got tired of ""Wedding Crashers"" and was glad when it was over.It is probably a popular movie, but I don't know why. Can't really recommend it."
1,Demeaning and pornographic-this isn't 1970!,"This movie in the beginning shows two divorce lawyers crashing a Jewish, Indian, and Irish wedding. Then it proceeds to showing the two main characters scoring with desperate love-sick bridesmaids and attendees. However, it shows the bed with the two men fully clothed and completely naked with the camera zooming in on their implants. Made me nauseous and I stopped watching. I didn't realize this was a porno since I thought it was shown on TV. Hey hollywood, this isn't 1970, women aren't pairs of silicone to demean!!!!!! Here's some rules for you: 1. If you show a breast, show a scr0tum. 2. If you show a vag, show a pen1s. Geez, women should not have to strip to make it to the screen. Andrew Panay- I will never watch a movie produced by you! AMAZON-Please label this BETTER as it needs to be clear what a skanky porn flick this before others flush their 2.99 down the toilet."
4,A lot of fun.,"An enjoyable buddy flick, which although signposted fairly early on as to where it is going to go provides a lot of laughs along the way. Some gross out humour along with some genuinely funny set pieces. Besides any movie with The Walken in is worth the entry fee."
2,funny to a point,"i thought this movie was pretty funny, but i was truly expecting it to be hysterical.... it wasn't. i even bought it thinking i would want it in my collection, but was disappointed that it wasn't funnier. don't get me wrong, there were parts that i laughed out loud, but there are so many great comedies out there. it might have been better if one were having a party with friends and having a few drinks when they saw it..... i'll leave it up to you to decide!"
2,just Ok at best,"this film reminded me of a few films that were tied together&none of the best elements of those films. this film has some moments,but nothing that merits 2 hours&alot of tired cliches. it was very predictable for the most part&it took a good hour before things even kinda even got going.this is a film that will probably have a part 2 or 3 but not because it was so good,but it worked.it was just a Ok film to me."
3,"First Hour Very Funny, But Last Hour End Routinely With No Laughs!","I would have given this movie a higher rating but the best scenes occurred in the beginning.Vince Vaughn is at his best comedic role as Jeremy, who meets a crazy nympho who becomes too attached to him. Owen Wilson, who I never found that funny, is John, who falls for the Senator's daughter, Rachel McAdams, at one of the weddings. The movie goes from full blown laugh-out loud comedy and was becoming the new ""There's Something About Mary"" until the laughs died down. The movie ended as an ordinary romantic comedy, which are not truly funny. But overall the beginning hour had me laughing very hard and is worth watching to see Vince Vaughn at his sarcastic best. You will especially love the whole family dinner scene, which is the best since ""Meet the Parents."""
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Wedding Crashers succeeds in amusing audiences for its first half, but wears out its welcome by switching abruptly from anarchic comedy to uninspired, formulaic romance."
3,wouldn't crash this wedding tale,This movie was okay. I think i got too excited for it and it ended up being a disappointment. Don't get me wrong...it was funny...in some parts. The ending really ruined it for me...much too corny of an ending for a Vince Vaughn flick. BEST PART OF THE MOVIE...THE SCENES WITH WILL FERRELL!!!
1,dumb and obnoxious,"I saw this movie on TV and what a waste of time. It jumped all over the place, there is no continuity, and the language is a bit much. Some of the sex scenes and the scene with Jane Seymour as the mother, where she asks one of the wedding crashers to touch her breast is pretty obnoxious. All in all not a movie worth watching, but I guess most people will not agree with this."
