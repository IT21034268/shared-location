4,A great shave soap.,"I bought the bay rum and the almond. They have a really nice lather that doesn't fade quickly. Nice scent on the bay rum, but a little bit faint. The almond seems to have a much stronger smell to it. I would recommend the bay rum over the almond just on scent alone, unless you just love the smell of almonds."
5,NOW THIS IS TIMI YURO!,"This CD captures the full, vibrant, dymamic richness of Timi's voice. The emotion, energy and fullness of both her voice and the background sounds are like I remember 35 years ago on the old LP's. My wife and I have already spent several evenings just listening and reminiscing and yes even dancing to some of the songs. We significantly preferred this CD to ""The Great Timi Yuro"" CD. It must be the original recording , etc. but you can definitely hear the difference. I highly recommend this for Timi fans."
5,Great book!,"I wasn't sure I would like this book as I am not into philosophy or so I thought, but this book I can definitely highly recommend. This is the first book I have read that is written, not just from a scholarly point of view, but from an unabashed point of view of the joyful fan writing lovingly of the inhabitants of Middle-earth. This is by one of us! Frodo is Kreeft's favorite and mine which endeared this prolific author even more to me. He addresses all the big questions philosophy tries to answer about free will, fate, humility, friendship, mercy, evil, etc. and applies this to the story Frodo and Sam wrote in the Red Book. One of the more interesting points is we all know how strong evil is, but do we realize how weak it is? That is brought out here among many other things.He also has an essay in Celebrating Middle-earth that is very good so check that out also! Thank you, Professor Kreeft! God bless you."
1,Dreary.........,"I wanted to like this book. I have loved books set in England as well as so many set in the south. This dark little tale captured the charm of neither.The charachters- especially the ""heroine"" Gillon are all shallow and nasty individuals. Gillon is cold and mean to friends and family alike! The dialogue seemed to consist of people saying ""what"" or ""pardon"" to each other. There was no epiphany or growth- simply whining....There are so many great novels set in England- reread Bridget Jones if you cannot find something else! As for South Carolina- try D.B. Frank's Sullivan's ISland. And SKIP Girl from the South"
5,A Great Man from the Great State of Alabama!,"Hank started it all and was the country music icon that every successive star aspired to be before he died at the tender age of 29. This is the ultimate collection of Williams's hits and will probably be about 95% of what you need if you're looking to make a Hank Williams compilation (like I was). Personally, I love the older, ""tinny"" recordings of the old country greats, so Hank never disappoints. There are a couple of tracks (like Dixie Cannonball) that sound re-recorded, but the result is surprisingly good. If you love Hank, trust me, you'll love this collection."
3,A little misleading,"Though the microcassette recorder works just fine, the technical data is misleading. There is no lapel microphone included, which is one of the reasons why I chose this item."
5,"pricey, but a fantastic motherboard","I love this motherboard. It looks cool, works great, and was easy for me to install. It has a lot of included extras that basic boards don't have (I won't relist since they are mentioned in product description).You may see a lot of posts regarding higher temps with this board but that hasn't been my experience. I only have a $9 arctic cooler heatsync and fan on my AMD X2 4400+, and a single 120mm super quiet case fan. These keep my MB around 42 degrees and my cpu around 39.Despite its relatively high price, I'm glad I bought it and would do so again."
4,Fit for a Queen!,"Was so excited to receive this beautiful bed frame two days earlier than expected. Setup was a breeze (even for a fat little old lady). Frame is solid with no squeaks or wobbles.A bit disappointed in quality of workmanship on powder coating (thus not five stars). Several botched spots where it appears it may not have fully dried before being handled. Don't think it will keep me up at night but, like other reviewer, for the price I would expect better quality control from the manufacturer.All in all a fabulous addition to my beach cottage style bedroom."
2,17 years out of date,"Better recordings and performances have been available in the last 17 years than have been recommended in this book. This book was published in 1994 and the biographical data and recommended recordings are badly out of date. And the recommendations are mainly orchestral music. On the plus side the book is extremely easy to read and use and the significance and background of the composer is laid out in alphabetical order by name. The famous musical pieces are described without jargon or technicality and are clear to the point. The young generation of talent, however, such as Lang Lang, Hilary Hahn and Vasily Petrenko are missing. Great performances and recordings in the last 17 years are also missing.Many books on this subject today are more entertaining in terms of illustrations and text and more informative, such as John Burrow's Complete Book of Classical Music (Dorling Kindersley publication)."
3,was hoping for more,"It was toio short and needed more bio.. However Henson remains my hero, my inspiration and one of the few examples of what is good in this questionab;e world.Long Live Jim!"
4,"Good, But I'm Sure There's Better Henson Memorabilia","As I saw one reviewer mention, a quick glance through the pages instantly reveals that this isn't a full Henson bio, and I agree with the reviewer that such a bio would no doubt be superior to this little collection of quotes (no offense to the Henson family member that put this together).But you know, I was in the store, not really knowing what to buy, and when I saw this inexpensive item, I figured somebody like me with great respect for Kermit the Frog couldn't go wrong. I wasn't disappointed. I did see how Henson got his start in the business, and that was good. I don't recall seeing how Kermit came about, but some neat bits and pieces of Sesame Street appeared along the way. Too bad I never watched Fraggle Rock."
4,Starts slow but gets better,"An enjoyable silent film which can be found for as little as $2 (5 for $10 at Price Chopper stores in NY). Effects are surprisingly good, particularly costumes and makeup, and the underwater scene as mentioned (where Scarecrow fights a swordfish and meets a mermaid). Other enjoyable scenes include Scarecrow dancing with a giant Crow and the violent (if temporary) dispatching of Mombi by the Tin Woodsman. I'll disagree with some reviewers and say I liked the music...it's piano tracks mostly, with some guitar parts and percussion. Modern but fits with the film.Apparently three are at least 2 other Oz films from the same era and with many of the same actors, those titles being ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz"" and ""The Magic Cloak of Oz"". Attention Brentwood, can you find some good prints and release those?"
3,It's hard to write about a legend,This was an admirable attempt. Some interesting information is in this book ... but how much can be written about The Man?
3,Primitive but brilliant,"My mother introduced me to this genre of movies and this was the second one I ever saw. As a non African it takes a while to understand the jargon, but the acting makes up fully for what you do not understand. The two boys in the movie OSITA IHEME; CHINADU IKEDIEZE are so funny and mischievous, their acting alone sold me on getting more featuring them and they havn't disappointed me yet. it is worth seeing I know you will get a laugh out of it."
4,Fiddly but fine,"Some of the pre-drilled holes did not line up well, but otherwise putting this bed together went smoothly. Putting together the drawers does take two people though. I think it took less than 5 hours all told, even though I'm pretty hopeless at this sort of thing. It seems sturdy enough so far."
2,Very poor quality,"It's probably still worth the money, considering that shipping was free, but overall it's slightly worse quality than idea pressed wood furniture. Assembling it was pretty easy, and it looks cute, but when I move - this thing's going in the garbage. Not only it's made of pressed wood, it's made of very thin pressed wood."
2,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.,OZONE FRIENDLY SPRAY CAN DOES NOT SPRAY. CANT GET THE PRODUCT OUT OF THE CAN SO WASTE OF YOUR MONEY.
3,Citrus Magic review,"That first wiff of orange citrus is awesome, but hang onto the memory because it doesn't last long. You'll spend way too much for the short lived pleasure."
1,Not for MD's,The title of the book is misleading. This is a book which may be useful to chiropractors but contains little information of actual medicine related to injection tecniques.It is more of a manipulative technique manual. Scarce not only of illustrations but also information.The radiology pictures are smudged and poorly printed. There are much better books in the market on the topic.
4,What a Life!,"Errol had his ups and downs, but what a adventure. This man has scene some things. Errol is also a excellent writer. He comes up with some really well written sentences along the way. His true spirit comes through. He comes across as a honest man about who he is, good or bad. His adventure's in the islands north of Australia were the highlight for me. Picture a different time period where white man was the king. Cruel, yes, but a part of history. Let's just say, Errol was no angel. But a product of his times I guess. Very well written book, and I would definitely recommend it. Minus the way he treated the natives, I found Errol to be a good soul who was honest with himself about his short comings. If the words in this book are mostly true, I like the man. The world needs more deep thinkers. What a Life!"
3,"Great fruit mix, but contains 50% more sugar","This is a great mix of fruits with apples, pears and bananas. However, it contains 50% more sugar than other Gerber 2nd foods such as Gerber 2nd Foods Apricots with Mixed Fruit and Gerber 2nd Foods Pear & Pineapple (10g of sugar instead of 15g per container)I did not realize how sweet it is until I tasted the food."
5,Good phone,"It's so hard to find plain phones with a speakerphone these days, so look don't waste your time. This one will do you just fine."
5,Great show!,This DVD accurately reflects the broad talents and the nuances of Celtic music. I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD and their performance. This is a great value.
5,Celtic Thunder It's Entertainment,"I was so excited when my cd and dvd arrived on the date is was released (February 9, 2010). The anticipation and excitement was beyond belief. As soon as I could get the wrapper off of both of them, I popped the dvd in the player and sat back and just listened and looked at the most talented musicians I have seen in many years. All the songs were unbelieveable, but I especially enjoyed and was touched by the song ""Amazing Grace"". The harmonies were brilliant. I have watched my dvd every night before I go to bed. What a way to end the day!!!! I have also played my cd each time I get in the car to run an errand. I am a happy person and am more pleased than I ever imagined. I am now buying additional copies to give for birthday and special occasions. I cannot say enough about these two items. The other dvds and cds are also very well worth getting, also. Barb Lindsey"
5,The Amazing Six,What a multi-talented group these lads are. Can't ever get enough of their singing.There seems to be no end to the heights they will soar to. Love Love Love Love it. Give me more more more.
1,Not At All Celtic,"I was at the taping of this show in Toronto and hated it. Although a fan of Celtic Thunder since the beginning, I am taken aback by the group's departure from who they purport to be: celtic. The show looked like an amateur high school performance. Why in the world do they cover old american hits when they promised a celtic experience with a modern twist? Very disappointing. After 5 concerts, I'm out until they they bring back the excitement of songs like Caledonia, Ireland, Come By the Hills."
5,Celtic Thunder It's Entertainement,How well I remember when the lads first got together. Now to watch them grow and become more comfortable with each performance in their own skins. They are truly a long over due and welcome treasure in this day of grunge and screaming into microphones. They will last!
1,Beware French Language Text,"Fernando del Paso is one of Mexico's best authors and this is suppossed to be his best book. However, beware this edition is a French language translation. Double check to make sure that you get the Spanish language version."
3,"Poorly made, but usable.","Printed and cut impricisely so the edges are uneven and the poster isn't the dimensions it's supposed to be. Decent though, usable with some revisions or a background to hide edge imperfections."
4,A good read,"I really enjoyed this book. I having been diving more than twenty years, I held instructor certification, I am a published author, a very critical editor and an often hard-to-please reader. I am recommending this book to all my diving friends and many non-divers.The book is interesting, well written, informative, and it pulls you in. The last half of the book is very exciting.It is a good read."
2,What not to do in diving.,"This books greatest value is that it shows what NOT do to in diving, and why some people should not be allowed to dive."
5,Enjoyable even for non-divers!,"I picked this book up at the library because it looked interesting. I was hooked from page 1! I'm not a diver, I've never been interested in diving and I don't plan to start anytime soon. But this book was informative and compelling, but also very personal. I had no problem understanding the ""technical"" issues of deep-sea diving, and I feel that I learned quite a bit about the sport. Knowing from the beginning that the main characters would both die didn't make the book any less exciting."
5,Thought-provoking,"Wow. I was blown away by this sensitive, poignant account of tragic loss of life. The author's own near-death experience had me sitting on the edge of my seat. It was absolutely terrifying, and was written in such a way that I was right there in the chamber with him. The book also has an unexpected bonus--a brief history of the evolution of technical and recreational diving as we know it today. I especially loved the fact that Chowdhury shared his sessions with a psychologist with the readers, and delved somewhat into what motivates a tech diver. Most importantly, this book made me re-live every single one of my dives, and all the stupid things I have gotten away with. I dug out my dive logs and shuddered. Chowdhury may have saved me from my own accidents. This is a book that every diver, technical or recreational, needs to read. I can't stress that enough. It is incredibly sad. Hats off to Bernie Chowdhury and to Sue Rouse."
3,"Not quite ""Shadow Divers"" but not bad","I have read quite a few books from the diving genre of late, and this was probably my least favorite. It could be that I'm simply more interested in wreck diving than cave diving, but I wanted to give this book a try as the two main... well, characters, for lack of a better word, of the book appeared in ""Shadow Divers."" It took me a lot longer to get through this book than it normally takes me to get through a book, and for my personal standards, that says something. After reading a slew of very good wreck diving books, this one was sort of a let-down.Give it a try, but it really isn't anything spectacular."
2,"Last Dive?.....Gee, I wonder why?","A better title for the book would have been ""How to break every safety rule in the book, and pay the price!"" While I admit the book has interesting parts, it's basically the story of a scuba diving train wreck. With every decision the main character makes, you're just waiting to see how long it takes before something tragic happens. And then, of course, it does. I wasn't exactly sitting on the edge of my seat....the ending is predictable. This is simply a story of a bad diver."
1,This doesn't qualify as a radio,"This thing does not qualify as a radio in any regard. Well .. OK, it kinda looks like one, but a the photo will work just as well as the actual item. If you're looking for your first SW radio, spend a few extra bucks and get something else. The cheapest radio you can find on Amazon from Kaito (ie the WRX911)or Eton (ie The Mini) will outperform this thing by a mile.My recommendations for a budget SW radio .. the Kaito KA1101 or KA1102 .. both excellent performers."
4,yo-yo ma bach suites,Excellent relexful music that brngs down my blood pressure when listening to such melodic sounds.
5,$15 iPod? Yes please!,Owned many iPod but have always enjoyed my 5th gen Classic more than the others. I think it sounds better too and powered larger headphones with more headroom. This battery replacement was pretty easy. I broke many of the plastic tabs that are built into the faceplate. Mix some epoxy and place some heavy books and you're done. Couldn't be happier. Thank you.
1,junk,The battery I bought through amazon was junk the end broke off the first time I tried putting it in and o know what I am doing I have repaired several ipods
1,Never get to full charge,"The battery is aways charging, never stops, no matter how long it's been connected. When you disconnect it, the screen indicator always shows half charge. I've wrote to Amazon's Costumer Service and they asked me to send the item back to get a replacement. I didn't send it because that'll mean having my ipod unuseful for at least 2 weeks."
1,"worthless tools, battery would not charge","This is a complete hoax, the soft plastic tools were utterly ineffective, the battery never accepted any charging, and was a poor fit once I was able to open my iPod using my own tools. The directions were clearly ""computer translated,"" probably from Chinese, and were more of a commercial for the tacky, cheesy, product.Save your money, a Pet Rock is a better value."
5,Works Great,"My iPod was not holding any charge, this new battery makes it work like it did when I first bought it. Awesome!"
5,"New ipod, 30 gig classic battery","Ipod cover was difficult to remove, and the battery cable was difficult to put in the right position, but it was quite easy considering. the battery arrived partially charged and works like a dream, much better than my old battery that could only hold an hour long charge!"
1,Horrible Product!!!!!!!!!!!!,Charged once and worked for about a day and died. Buyer beware. What a waste of money!!!! You've been warned.
2,wheel of fortune gives a bad turn,"very disappointing. most of these are remakes, not the originals. I know as I at one time had the records, which I bought the hard way, one 45 rpm at a time. Laine always had great background support via the Columbia studios which is definitely missing. The Woman in Love does not do her thing with the Moonlight Gambler."
5,Husbands hogging the Playstation 2!,"I purchased this game for my husband who is an avid bass fisherman. So far the only problem I can find in this game is he stays on it and won't give me any play time. This bass game isn't for someone who just wants to play fisherman. It's for the person who wants to fish like the big boys. You drive the boat, pick your spots and lures and try your best to get the ""Shadow's"" (17 to 20 lb granddaddy's) to hit. It's not easy, but it's worth the price. Maybe when the weather warms up and it's time to hit the great outdoors, I'll get some play time, I don't see it until then."
5,Wonderful stage adaptation,"I had the good fortune to see this very production at Stratford, Ontario, and this video does a wonderful job capturing the feel of the live performance. It was magical on the night: Plummer is outstanding in a difficult role, Caliban pitched just right, the masque of Ceres breathtaking, and the lords a strong supporting cast. I've seen several stage adaptations of this play, and this exceeds them all. I'm delighted to be able to own it on DVD."
2,"Factually accurate, but as dull as dishwater","Palmer's scholarship is immaculate, but this is one of the dullest books I've ever read. Let's hope that history professors overlook this book; it's the type of work that by itself could turn a student away from the study of history."
5,Burning down the house.,I have hundreds of CDs and if my house was burning down I would grab my Badfinger Straight up CD as I was running out the door.
5,The best non-Beatles album on the Apple label.,The album Straight Up by Badfinger was the epitome of early to mid-70's pop/rock. The bonus tracks provide a great addition.
5,an absolute corker!!!!!,"This is one of the truly great rock albums.The tragic story of Badfinger only highlights what exeptional musicians they were and what a fantastic album this is.If you can spare the time,sit back, relax and enjoy a rare pleasure."
5,learning books,This is a really good book. Everyone of the Berenstain Bear books has a wonderful lesson in it.
4,Good Start,"I started using the pills twice a day yesterday and after the first intake I immediately lost my appetite. I had a breakfast of golden grahams cereal with banana and usually I get hungry during the day and give in to snacks but I literally had no appetite! When lunch came around, I had a small portion of pasta and a tangerine and was immediately full. Today was basically the same, except I'm starting to have stomach pains. I'm not sure if this is caused from the pills or something else but I still like the pills and would recommend them to anyone who needs control from overeating!"
2,Took whole bottle small results,I took the whole bottle and only lost 5 pounds But I don't even think that it was from the pills because I've been working out and eating right . I think I will try a new pill next time
5,An excellent book for the *animation* of battle scenes,"If you view this book as just a drawing book, then I can understand some of the negative reviews.For example, one of the reviewers complained that the author spent too much time on the drawings for a side kick. And that reviewer was absolutely right.The reason is: this is really an ANIMATION book. And all those ""redundant"" drawings that the author is spending time on are the Key Frames and Passing Frames that are ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL for creating great animations.For example, take Macromedia Flash, draw in those key and passing frames. Then draw in the inbetweens, and you have FANTASTIC animated action sequences. I know, because I've done it!Viewed as an animation book, this is THE DEFINITVE BOOK for martial-arts, anime animation.Buy the Animator's Survival Kit by Richard Williams, along with this book and you will have a complete course on anime animation."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"FIRST THE ARMS ON THE CHAIR CAME APART, THEN THE BACK OF THE CHAIR DID THE SAME. IT IS CHEAP WOOD THAT DOESN'T LAST. IT'S NOT EVEN A YEAR SINCE I BOUGHT IT. IT WAS A REALLY LOW PRICE THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT IT. THE OLD SAYING IS TRUE, ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"" !!!"
2,15 months then it broke.,"This is an okay glider. The wood is fine. The gliding parts are fine. Still silent when we glide. The back did break but I replaced the nuts (with some studier ones from the hardware store) and now it's fine. I weighed about 180 lbs just to give you something to compare.The biggest warning I have is don't let your kids play in it! Since their legs don't extend over the front, their center of gravity is further back in the chair. My son tipped it backwards and he only weighs 24 lbs! They are strong enough to do this already. Good thing I was there to catch him! Make sure you watch them carefully or put the glider near a wall so that it can't fall backwards."
3,comfortable ... but disposable,"I thought this chair was very comfortable but it only lasted a year. Astonishingly, the company doesn't offer any replacement parts (springs or cushions). The arm cushions were enjoyable but they wore quickly."
1,9 months or less,"DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT buy this chair. My Husband's grandmother bought this chair for us. I picked it out because it was cheap and matched the furniture for the room. Well slowly things came apart the arms started spreading screws became loose, and as of 2 weeks ago the back started coming loose and the screws are falling out. the holes have gotten so big fromt he screws that you can't put it back together.I have used the chair a lot our daughter was a very fussy infant, but I will never buy another chair like this again. The next chair I invest in will last through her and any other children we have.Cheaper is not always better."
4,Natural Glider/Ottoman Combination with Beige Fabric,Over all good product. Works great. Easy to assemble. Snaps on arm rest cushions were a bit tough to engage. But overall great!
4,"Lake ""Lake II""","I bought this in Germany back in 2005 when I went back for a visit. It was bought as a replacement for the vinyl copy I had. As I have said about Lake, you either like them or don't, depending on your like of Pop music. I like Lake, and this was my favorite album of theirs.""Red Lake"", ""Loves The Jailer"" ""Highway 216"", and of course ""Scoobie Doobies"", all about the dangers of popping pills, are excellent cuts. If you like Lake, I recommend this item."
2,not really feeling this Album,Sinead O'Connor is One of the best Stylist Singers over the past 20 years to me.problem with her material is that at times She can be heavy handed with the Material. this Album doesn't move me because She doesn't need to be doing any collaborations. Her Instrument of a voice should easily be able to carry any song.this collection seems tossed together as to feeling like a Cohessive Album on a whole to me.with the right material Sinead could make a Pretty Good to Very good Album with the right musical match up&Hook up.this ain't it.
1,propeller,The boat is great. Loved the propeller drive at first but it fell off after the second use. It went down the drain unnoticed by my 7 year old.
5,Grandson loves it!,"I bought this for my darling three year old grandson for Christmas. It attaches to his '' Motorcycle Boat"" (Jet Ski) that he got for Christmas. He loves it, plays with it every night in the bathtub."
2,Not what we needed,"The title is ""What's Cheap and Free in Cancun and the Yucatan"", however the content is What's cheap and free in and around Cancun (including the major tourist areas). What we were looking for was information about things to do on the Yucatan, south of Cancun (closer to Tulum), especially snorkling places, restaurants, places to go that are not necessarily the major tourist spots.When we received the book, the included DVD was coming out of the protective plastic sheet on the front of the cover and was scratched and will not play in either of our computers (though I don't know if it is due to it's being scratched or some component our computers don't have installed)so I can't tell if it would have been useful or not.Aside from my being disappointed about what was not in the book, we will likely take it with us on our trip. Maybe there will be something useful in it for us, especially if we decide to go see some of the major tourist places."
3,QUEEN HELENE Super Cholesterol Hair Conditioning Cream 2lb/907.2gQUEEN HELENE Super Cholesterol Hair Conditioning Cream 2lb/90,"It is not the one I wanted, I had another one before that was smoother and had a better smell, but it does the job."
1,"Fails in a thing called ""battle""...","I really don't know how hard it is to make a battling engine fun. The creators installed bad camera angles. They also made the fighting bland. These 2 things combine to make the game a less-than-average expierience. The camera can affect you during platform jumps. If you want a platform game get ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"". If you want a fighting game get Tekken 2. If you want a great game simply avoid ""The Hobbit""."
2,"this is soooo bad,but..............",the resin i gave it a 2 is it was prety fun untill fleis and spiders i cant jump on that thing to get too that brach it is so frustrated i hate this game and i hate lotr the return of the king the two towers rocked buy that not this :)
1,The Hobbit,"If you are a fan of Tolkien then you should not buy or even play this game. It ruins the vision of Middle-earth that we Tolkien fans have in our minds. ""The Hobbit"" is an incredible book but just isn't video game material."
4,My Twins Love It!,I have 4 yr old fraternal twin daughters and they both love Dress Up Days. We own all of the Strawberry Shortcake series and this is one of their favorites. Can't comment on the quality of the DVDs since we have VHS only.
2,Disappointed,"The first story here is a Cinderella story with Strawberry Shortcake dressed up and playing Cinderella. It was sweet, and my 3 1/2 year old liked it. But the second story was about the gang meeting Rainbow Sherbet, and Peppermint Patty was a nasty little girl mean to and talking behind Rainbow's back because she is 'different' since she lives on a boat, saying that was the most rediculous thing she's ever seen, plus she dresses differently. She was mean and Rainbow was crying. Yeah, there is a lesson here as Strawberry tries to explain that if we were all the same how boring the world would be, but this is probably lost on my daughter as she's sitting there starting to get a bit bored by the slow story that comes off way too negative for the typical movies that are so upbeat and fun. There is a contrived ending where Peppermint realizes she was wrong, but I still recommend the new Moonlight Mysteries way over this one-- that's my daughter's favorite."
1,Here we go again . . .,"I had to exchange this dress up days dvd since it kept freezing up . . . and when I put the ""new"" dvd in the player, the dvd wouldn't even load. For some reason many of the SS DVD's tend to skip and freeze, I suspect due to poor quality manufacturing. Save your $$ and rent this once from the video store for a weekend."
2,Meh,"I heard one of these songs on an online holiday mix and thought I'd buy the cd. It's okay, but nothing to write home about."
5,Warm Sarcasm and Humor,"I am rather a connoisseur of comic strips. This one shows awesome humor, such warm and gentle teasing, a truly spectacular series about a couple with a loving relationship full of accepting but pointed humor. I wish I had this kind of marriage! Five stars, yes indeed. The strips published AFTER this book became more bitter, probably because Hirsh was *trying* to be funny, and the couple lost the warm closeness. But this collection is perfect, very homey and welcoming humor. The couple truly loves each other, and their bickering/nattering is so infused with appreciation and self-awareness that it warms the heart. NOT smarmy."
3,a glimpse of an young author,"This book was written for fun by the author. She was also 17 when she wrote it. I found it pretty offending to a point ( you must understand about the anti- oriental propaganda that was going around early this century) but it was O.K.... I found it a tad boring. I think she wrote this to amuse her friend, especially courtaney...."
2,Gail Manizak,"I have not received this item. It was due to be received on the 17th of Feb, but has not arrived as yet. TY"
5,Avoiding diabetes,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends ATKINS DIABETES REVOLUTION for everyone who is a bit overweight & for their children who seem to be following in their footsteps.If you're new to the Atkins way of life, then this huge, reader-friendly manual will introduce you to another way of looking at that aphorism: You Are What You Eat.It is packed with a ton of information about lifestyles, scientific case studies, health programs & success stories as well as recipes & eating plans -- the rest is up to you.ATKINS DIABETES REVOLUTION is for getting the best out of the rest of your life!"
4,Great information,As I new diabetic I was looking for a life style change that I could do. This book gave me scientific bases for why this works.
2,It's so not totally Atkins,"I'd recommend Atkins' other books but found this one tedious. Too many cooks in the kitchen have ruined the dish. (It was not entirely written by Dr. Atkins) Sadly I found no recipes in it that were worth making again. This is not a good representation of what low carb eating is, IMO, compared to Dr. Atkins' other books. This may turn someone off."
1,Embarrassingly mediocre,"The problem with this movie is that none of the kids can really dance. Even in the much anticipated ""finals"" , after spending 70 minutes watching a couple of kids say one or two cute things and learn some steps, they basically end up stumbling around on an open air stage, and then wait very excitedly to hear who will win the ""revered"" CUP. I see others here mention the movie ""Spellbound"" - now THAT is a great docu to watch, because the kids are phenominal, their background stories diverse and fascinating, and the prize they compete for has clout. This is a home movie intended for the participants, NOT the rest of the world. Imagine watching a home video of your baby brother singing a song badly. Everyone in the family goes :""aaaahhhh"" and enjoys it, but as soon as you have to show it to strangers it becomes embarrassing. Ditto this movie. It's really ""much ado about nothing"". Don't waste your time."
4,good feel good film,"this film concentrates on Teachers showing Kids dance steps&it's also very uplifting. it's a way of using dance as a Creative Outlet&also maintaing healthy stability.the Dancing is very competitive,but it's also in fun. the film has a good message&very uplifting."
5,can you say merengue?,"In 1994 ball room dance classes were introduced for fifth graders at two New York City schools. The pilot program was so successful that today 6,000 children in 60 NYC schools are required to take a ten-week class in ball room dancing, with teachers provided by the American Ballroom Theater. The documentary Mad Hot Ballroom gives you a front row seat and behind the scenes preview of what has now become an annual citywide competition. This is a wonderful film that would make for great family viewing and later discussion."
1,Terrible book,"I bought this book hoping to find some tips toward boosting my scores. However, what I got was a poorly written, error-filled nothing of a book that looked like it had been typeset by hand and contained not one iota of useful information. It's literally painful to read this book: the author himself probably scored poorly on the verbal section of the SAT. Don't buy this book."
5,Great reference but a CD ROM is needed,"This is a great reference tool, but one must ask why there is not a CD rom Version. I could easily have it running behind the scenes and use it on demand and save a few trees."
2,"An old, out-of-date product., cira Win95","I was quite disappointed with this software. The MIDI USB adaptor was fine, but the piano tutoral was very primitive with low res. graphics and it doesn't even support long filenames!! It looks like it was designed for Windows 95 and hasn't been updated since.I'm suprised they still market this. If I didn't need the MIDI adaptor for other things, I would have returned the whole package."
5,"Nice, Very Nice.","Awesome looking toy, very adjustable and looks great on a shelf. Pretty cool armor under that cloak too!"
3,Not as interesting as you would think,It started off really strong and I thought it would be great. In the middle though it hit a block and then drug on for the rest of the book. It was entirely too long it could have included some more information or been cut by about 100 pages. It is at the very least something different so I read on.
4,Great read,Took this book with me on vacation....was entranced. The story will make you laugh and cry. I got so caught up in it that it was easy to forget that it is fiction. The author amazed me with her insights and descriptions. Definitely worth the time.
5,Must read book.,The Girls is one of the most amazing books I have read recently. A topic that sounds unappealing turns into a most engrossing and amusing tale. A book that you just don't want to end. Highly recommended.
4,the girls,this was a haunting novel...it stayed with me for a long time..it was sad and kind of funny at the same time..I liked the girls who were the hero's of the book....I loved the two people who took them in and gave them a life to celebrate...yeah I really feel that the author was top notch...in having you step into their lives and feel what they must feel and endure..
5,Achingly beautiful,"This is a truly remarkable work. It's so movingly written it's hard to believe the author isn't one of the twins. I'm not half way through and already I'm dreading the ending, when there is nothing more to read, except to read it again.This novel is a gift to us all - a modern masterpiece, the sort of book that you'll want to buy copies to give to those you love during the holidays."
4,It will haunt you.....,"It is that type of book, you cant put it down. You fall in love wit the characters. I wanted it to be a true story and had to remind myself it was fiction. It will move you, if it doesnt......well......I am not sure what that would mean."
3,1959 version,"This is the vocal score to the 1959 version of Babes in Arms- a very popular Rogers and Hart show. It has songs like, where or when, Johnny one note, I wish I were in love again, my funny valentine, and the lady is a tramp. The show differs greatly from the 1939 film(which was based on the 1937 show) starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, but it is still a great find for all you lovers of musical theatre."
5,Great co-sleeper sheets.,These are soft and fit great. I had heard that ordering co-sleeper sheets from another source doesn't always work out.....they aren't as soft and don't always fit well. I liked this so much that I ordered another one later. I knew from my older daughter's experience when she had her twin boys 5 years ago that you shouldn't dry these in the dryer so I air dried them. They are great and I recommend them.
5,History comes alive,As a former teacher I still enjoy reading children's books. This book has everything in it. It is funny and exciting at the same time. Ruby Jo is a character you will come to love! Your children will be introduced to a historical period they will never forget.
3,"I DIG! love, I don't love DIG!","First off, I will say that this is a well put together Documentary. There's hardly a dull moment, but there's plenty to scoff at. The hook of the whole film seems to be: Here's this tormented rock prodigy (Anton), watch as he squanders his talent.However, the only thing in the movie that would lead you to believe that this guy even has any talent is because people (non-of-which anybody has ever heard of) say he does. The real story here is: Here's some guys on the cusp of the garage rock revival, watch as they blow every chance at success with every rock n' roll cliche you've ever heard.So you made some bland phsycadelic garage rock the mid to late ninties, so did Belle and Sebastian and nobody gives a sh*t about them. Get over yourself, no wonder the Dandy Warhols never went anywhere with this guy as their biggest influence."
2,Nothing earth shattering.,"I quite enjoyed watching this movie but really learned nothing new from it. That this movie follows the lives of two bands of minimal talent who display hardly anything resembling originality (both in their music and their behaviour) means that anyone looking for any artistry here will be disappointed.The story of these two bands sounds promising but the outcome is so inevitable that there is no tension or surprises - one band milks it's 15 minutes of fame for all it's worth and the other self destructs.There is no genuine humour or wit here - just drug inflated delusional egos congratulating each other, declaring each other geniuses when the world at large really doesn't care.Ok so this documentary captures it all and captures it well but to me it just felt like I'd seen it all before and with much more interesting characters."
2,superficial reviews,"I recommend Maltin's guide over this one. The reviews are infinitely better written and more entertaining to read. These ones sometimes give no information at all about films (sometimes none whatsoever -- check POLICE ACADEMY 5), and always give new films absurdly long reviews. Maltin always writes more or less the same amounts for every entry. Also, the reviews sound like they're written by amateurs, not critics or film historians. They are written lazily and quickly, I'm sure. They are also often inaccurate. Who could ever state that POLTERGEIST is better than RAGING BULL? Well, these people do. They also think ERNEST GOES TO JAIL is a ""comic gem"". Better than THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY. That should be more than enough to suggest you should to stick with Maltin and forget about this sloppy guide."
3,"Fun for kids, so-so for adults","Based on the novel by Darren Shan, ""Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant"" is a lively, though decidedly minor, addition to the bloodsucker-mania that's been sweeping through pop culture these past several years. As the title suggests, the story is about an all-American small town boy (Chris Massoglia) who is turned into a vampire - and then a vampire's assistant - when a mysterious circus freak show comes to town.The tone of the film is upbeat and sunny despite the inherent darkness of the material, making it an ideal diversion for the teen and pre-teen crowd. For adults, there are some fun performances by John C. Reilly, Willem Dafoe, Salma Hayek, and Jane Krakowski (""30 Rock"") to make the work at least watchable and palatable, if not exactly a riveting experience or required viewing."
3,yawn,"Another adolescent attempt at film making. Obviously ths pilot movie didn't make it past the Universal Studeo's review board to qualify for a TV show. It sort of reminded me of Steven King's 'Fantasia' (shrinking people and dressing them in monk costumes to use as slaves) , but the special efects were exceptional. Rebellious kids discover that mayby mommy and daddy were right. How many times are they going to use this plot?"
1,Ridiculous,"if anyone has ever read the books DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE IT IS AN ABOMINATION YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED it lacks so many details that you need to understand whats going on it skips around threw out the story line Debby was not a monkey girl she was a girl that Darren fell in love with when Mr. Crepsley and him were on there way to vampire mnt. i would never recommend this movie to anyone, and if you haven't read the books read them before you buy this p.o.s movie or u will be completely and utterly in the dark about a lot of the story."
4,Much Better Than Expected!,"Ok. I am a hard sell on vampire movies. Have been since Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE hit the screen. I tested out this movie tonight because there was nothing else on...The verdict is that I liked it. It was never melodramatic -- thank goodness! I HATE the melodramatic, soap-opera feel of some vampire shows. This one was straight-forward and funny. The boy starring in it was very sweet, very convincing. I understand that this movie comes from a book series but I haven't read them. As a movie, standing alone, it did very well. I think if you enjoy FRIGHT NIGHT you'll enjoy this.4 out of 5 stars. That's my humble opinion.Ellen C Maze, authorVampire fiction like none other..."
4,"Not top shelf, but entertaining.","I liked it. It's a bit troubled, plot-wise. I'm puzzled why some big actors are bothering to play such bit roles. It's a new twist on the Vampire genre. I'm guessing the sequel i salready planned? The door is left wide open for that @the end."
4,More to it than you think,"If you've read the series of books from which this movie is drawn, you'll recognize the characters clearly. That certainly eliminates the confusion I felt while watching this movie before reading the books. Nevertheless, I found the movie more entertaining and the characters more engaging each time I watched this film. There is always something new I see with each viewing. This movie has a broad appeal that does not wear out its welcome. I wish there would be a sequel."
3,Try this after you complete Pimsleur,"For the price, this material is okay. I completed Pimsleur German I to III before I used this, and am so glad I did study this way. This is more like you to remember vocabularies, which Pimsleur lacks a bit. This material will not make you to be able to carry conversation at all but at least you can learn necessary vocabularies."
5,Great after learning the basic,"This is such a good material Berlitz always have great books, You can use this book after you learn the basic of German it's not for beginners, I think It will help to improve the german you've already learnedPd: I thought it was a bigger book but it's not that big"
1,Humpday,"A movie about two men who want to have a homosexual encounter, but don't go through with it at a hotel."
1,Ellmann for Dummies,"Pearce begins his book pompously: ""I am convinced that [this book] penetrates to the very core of its subject."" Yet, rather than provide insight into Wilde as Pearce claims, the book is only the Reader's Digest version of Ellmann's biography. If you are short on time and want an overview of Wilde's life and work, you could do worse. Just don't expect perceptive analysis."
1,Big Problems!,"I purchased the DVD player 10/09/2001 and have had problems ever since. The unit would play a DVD Vidio for about 30 to 45 minutes and stop with the image frozen on the screen, nothing could be done to correct the problem.The unit was in for repairs from 11/01/2001 until 11/27/2001, with the PC board assembly and pick up mechanism replaced. It worked OK for three months, and now the same problem is happening again."
2,Implausible Characters,"I didn't like the book because I felt the character development was lacking. Good writers make you believe that it's possible for their characters to exist in real life, but as I was reading Burger Wuss I kept thinking, ""These people are so weird! I can't imagine anyone like them."" It was just too unbelievable to think that people as strange as them could exist. Plus they were too one-sided...; they didn't really have depth."
2,Typical,"This is the typical story of a boy who broke up with his girlfriend but still has feelings for her. I didn't like this book very much because it used many stereotypes of guys and girls. The humor was pretty weak. The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is because you can tell the author tried, and it's pretty honest. Maybe if you like teen angst books you might enjoy Burger Wuss more than I did."
1,It's broken on me 3 times,Panasonic service told me they have tons of problems with these models but I can't produce my receipt so it's $124 to fix. They don't care even though they know the phone sucks. The phone is now in the trash and Panasonic will not get my business again. My other friends who have similar models don't like or hate their phones as well.
2,Low Budget,"Clearly, friends of the production team are commenting here. About two members from the total cast could actually act and while none of the rest were exactly terrible, they were definitely community theater material. Lighting looks like it was done with hardware store halogens and the audio guy was last seen mixing church choir productions (a lot of clipping and bad sound levels). Could I do better? Nope, but then again I'm not selling video on Amazon, either..."
2,There are better books!,"I read several books on finding a mate, and while this book had a few very useful tips, it's focus seemed to be more on bath-houses and ""campy"" humor. Save your money, here! 2 books to buy are: Husband Hunting Made Easy (Patrick Price) and Finding True Love in a Man-Eat-Man World (Craig Nelson). The Patrick Price book is #1 if you only want to buy one book. I used the information from these books, and have found my Mr. Right. Good luck!"
2,No Don't Try,I was all excited for a new Camera Obscura release. Then I found out it wasn't the right Camerca Obscura. What can I say? This album just doesn't do it for me. If I wanted Belle and Sebastian I would listen to them. There's no need for more chamber pop. It offers nothing to break the mold or any hope for something different. I'm gonna go listen to the old Camera Obscura...or some REAL Belle & Sebastian
2,Nothing special,"I should have saved my money. It took weeks to arrive, by the time it had, I already found plenty of free info on iron palm training. This dvd does not include anything that blew me away. I was expecting something more I guess."
1,How can I review something I dont have?,It has been over 4 months and I still have not recieved it in the mail! I just waisted good money.
5,For fans of classical music as well as Oldfield,This is an especially nice variation of Tubular Bells. It translates well to a classical orchestra. All the elements of the original (except the spoken introductions) are there. Those who enjoy classical music will enjoy this album. Those collecting variations of Tubular Bells should not miss this one.
1,fraud,"Thomas Keen is one of the James Patrick Lacy bunch. He learned from a video too. I'm just not sure I would trust the chance of perminant long term damage and neuropathy in my hands to someone who received his skills by sending a guy "" boxtops"". Look at James Lacy's website for Thomas Keen. He is all over it."
5,Fiamm El Grande horns,"I put this horn on a 93 Mazda Miata. Once I found a spot to mount it, all went fine. The horns sound like I was hoping for. No more whimpy Japanese economy car sound! These horns sound like a big American car, and they command the attention that a horn is supposed to.I did not use the relay supplied with these horns, I am still using the factory relay. I hope that is not a problem."
5,Fiamm 74100 El Grande Twin Horns,Bought these horns off Amazon for my 2010 Toyota 4runner. They arrived quickly and secure. I used them to replace the stock horns and am quite happy with them. The price was right and the product did as advertised.
2,Wife hates phone,Ditto other poor reviews. Worst problems with phone is that you can't hold phone between cheek and shoulder or it will terminate phone call. Wife wants to throw it out. Also battery life miserable...keeps telling me it needs to be charged after receiving a full charge even though it has a new battery. Otherwise has some good features.
5,Can you hear me now?,"I was familiar with the Fox 40 whistle from my days when I taught P.E. As an administrator, my playground staff needed a whistle that could be heard. This is the loudest whistle I know of and it certainly gets their attention! We ordered green for our school colors."
3,Misleading,"This product works great for what i will use it for however, the picture above is VERY misleading and i thought i was buyin gmore than 1."
2,"Way Too Schematic, compared to ""Room for Love""","I guess Room for Love shows how far this author has come. Captive Heart is disappointingly thin, allowing hasty dialogue/third-person monologue declaring the cardboard characters' feelings and intentions to take the place of careful, evocative descriptions of places, and of persons with inner lives."
1,Eh,"I could never quite get why anybody considered this guy funny, or even clever. His stuff is just silly pictures containing ideas and statements that never cross the line to associative humor. Humor without a twist from a reference point. It' a hard thing to pull off. James Thurber pulled it off. Poor Jerry just doesn't."
3,Not as pictured...,"Cons: The bamboo is a gold-bronze with yellow-brownish tone and the supposed white background has a grayish-blue hue and is darker as advertised.My room is black and white Japanese stile,with natural stone ornaments. So,putting this window film at my slide doors , it just don't fit because of the blueish - goldish color of the film.Now my living room looks like an souvenir shop of the 70's.pro:It's easy to put on.Good for souvenir shops."
5,One of a kind,This book is easy to read. It has humor and solid instruction for all level of golfers. Certainly worth giving to those I play golf with.
3,Pandora's Box,"It was alright, but it seem that something was missing in the book.. Im still trying to figure out what happened to Justice Martin? Did he just walk away with everything? Hersey, and Gabrialle was never intruduced into the book properly. You know the book had so many unanswered questions. Maybe next time.."
4,"SLOPPY PAINT JOB, BUT A PERFECT FOOT-SOLDER!!!!!!","I found this solder, along with 3 other knights at Middletown. This guy has a powerful crossbow for long-range attacks. You cannot have only one. BEWARE, this figure has a sloppy paint job. Other then that, this solder is a perfect army-builter and is ready to take out your oppnent's infantry."
5,Life saver for 2 year old (28-33 months),"Great show for parents of ""transitional twos"".BBGP's are surprisingly educational, extremely well written/delivered, and enjoyable. Compared to a lot of crap in the market, this is very commendable."
5,Really love this!,"Kiddo adores this show. She love, love, loves the music and asks to watch the songs again and again. She even tries to copy the dancing! She's also learned a ton from the show. All those Mr. Grouper let's think about its she has memorized the answers and not just repeats them, but understands them. She even memorized the songs down to who dances/sings in the background on each one. It's like a kid magnet! If I play this when we're traveling random children drift over to us in the airport to look over her shoulder! Usually when we're at home I let her watch one show a day after lunch/before nap and it's usually this, Umizoomi, or a Go, Diego, Go (she's animal obsessed). Hope she continues to love it because she ""discovered"" this around the same time as Sesame Street and she's very over sesame. This keeps going strong!"
2,doesn't cover Oracle 10.2,"I bought this book to get more info about XMLTable and XMLQuery functions, which came out in Oracle 10.2, but there is nothing. I assume it covers Oracle 10.1 (XMLSequence methods) and no further. The editors should either update the book or make it clear it doesn't cover Oracle 10.2 enhancements. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known..."
4,RESPECT that's the main thing !,"First, I'm NOT into remixes BUT when it's done with RESPECT for the original... In this case, IT IS. You exactly recognise the song and that's already a very positive thing. You really hear another way, another style without losing the greatness of the song itself. You can agree or disagree. Never touch a good thing ofcourse but these tracks prove that they could be hits from the future, instead of the past.GREAT WORK."
3,not a great blade,"this blade is a good blade, not great. it leaves fur spinters on both sides of the cut. So it is not the cleanest cutting blade."
2,One of the worst hair bands...,"I'm sorry, but I just have never really liked Great White. I love 80's hair metal, and even enjoy disposable bands like Trixter, but this is one album I could never get into. Besides the cover of Ian Hunter's ""Once Bitten Twice Shy"", which is great, this album just doesn't work for me. ""The Angel Song"" is a prime example of why so many critics hated the power ballad back in the 80's. Buy BON JOVI, buy POISON, buy DANGER DANGER, or FIREHOUSE, but I recommend staying away from GREAT WHITE."
3,Love it!,"We just bought this for our son who is 1 year old. It holds all of his toys (which is a lot) and him if he wants to climb in and ""hide."" It is light enough that we can move it around, but too heavy for our son to move. I love that the door to toy area can't come crashing down on him and that he can open and close it himself. I recommend this to anyone looking for a durable and sturdy toybox."
4,Great replacement for my sealed beams,"Bought these to replace my sealed beams that were fading and hadn't been replaced in 10 years. These put out more light, are high quality and I like that I can replace the bulbs rather cheaply. These were pretty expensive but I prefer the Hella brand and these had super saver shipping. Another good alternative are the AutoPal housings - much cheaper and well rated. But they didn't have super saver shipping."
2,Wildcrafters,I had a very difficult time with this book. The author needs to do more research on people and places. Someone needs to proof read for facts. Anyone who has ever been around children will be put off by this book
3,Shame on Amazon ...,"Shame on Amazon ... this is not Robert Rodriguez' Chingon, and they should not associate it as such. Though I may not be brown or down, I still like this CD. It's definitely more of narco-corridos meets LA-ghetto-style rap than anything any Robert Rodriguez fan would be expecting (again, thanks to Amazon's incompetence). My grade school Spanish lessons don't help much with the slang, but that doesn't keep me from sweet dreams of a royal purple '64 Impalla with gold wire rims, pneumatic shocks, and a trunk full of subwoofers."
4,Spicy stuff. I like it hot!,"Great chips. I bought a whole box and they were gone within a month. They're pretty hot, so don't buy them unless you like your chips hot and spicy. This one is no joke."
3,Good but nothing new,"This information has been readily available to authors for a long, long time. What surprised me was the lack of examples of some of the most important tools of the trade. There is no examples of query letters (though she admits their importance) or synopses. The only discussion that tracks how a query letter should be written is for nonfiction. There are online resources for free that cover everything here and if you are a serious student of writing/publishing, you already know it."
4,A potpourri of the medieval religious military orders.,"The book is a brief yet interesting overview of the principalmilitary crusading orders--the Templars, Hospitallers, andthe Teutonic Knights. It covers all of these from their inceptionuntil their decay and dissolution. Unfortunately, the authoruses some foreign / archaic words and phrases in thecourse of his work, and gives a generally scholarly presentation,which may decrease its appeal to the casual reader. Also,he goes into more extensive detail than some might like,especially in regard to the activities of the Teutonic Knightsin their last days. But, all in all, to the lay historian (such asmyself) of medieval times, I found it worth the reading andlearned a lot about the relationships and rivalries that existedamong these warrior priests"
1,Quite Possibly THE Worst Thing I Have Ever Heard In My Life,"This album is unutterably horrible. Cheesy 70's sound effects and chicken wakka-wakka guitars, horrible narration, and some of the cheesiest lyrics I have ever heard in my life make this one embarassing listen. I give it no stars. Phil Lynott is the only saving grace for this album, but even he's not enough to make it worth spending any more than $0.30 on!"
5,No need for words!,"I simply can't say anything that hasn't been said in the other reviews. This record is one of those you have to own if you want to call your record collection complete! Everything on this record is magical, Forever Autumn has to be the best song ever. Thank you Jeff"
4,Rock Version of Classic Story,"I was really glad to see this released,is outstanding! The whole first half is great, especially ""Forever Autmn"" (which was a hit for Justin Hayward), ""Eve of War"" and ""Thunder Child"". It tails off just a tiny bit on the 2nd half, ""Spirit of Man"" and ""Brave New World"", are not quite as strong. The sound effects, bridge music and background to the narration are all perfect, weaving the spell of the Martians.""The chances of anything coming from Mars, are a million to one..... but still, they come"""
4,I liked it then and it's OK now...,"Ok, I admit, I had the album and I thought it was great, and when I saw the CDs I order them right away.And it's still great. OK, it's alittle dated, but I love that period synth sound (sorry, samples just aren't the same as a wailing analog synth!), the disco bass (and I hated disco), and even the oolas (I'm pretty sure that's Phil Lynott singing that), and anything that gives credit for ""Heat Ray"" gets a plus in my book ;).Anyway - while I don't really thing that fans of prog rock will REALLY like this, it's a pretty good album - Justin Heyword is in good voice here and Forever Autumn is a good song, and there's some really cool guitar and synth riffs so it's got good playing, good songs, and it's an interesting approach to War of the worlds.AND - if you've read this far and you've got the spare cash, go for it, we KNOW you want it!"
5,Great Windu!,"First of all, Mace is extremely difficult to find..it took me almost a month to finally track one down at a local toys r us. But boy, was the wait worth it. The figure actually looks like Sam Jackson, which was a huge plus, and has a stone-faced expression on the face, which is appropriate for the character and much better than the ""screaming"" version from the AOTC line. Very poseable and has a cool feature..he ""throws"" off some force lightning from his shoulders. It also comes with his cool signature purple electrum lightsaber. Overall, its a great figure and if you manage to find one, you should consider yourself lucky. Also, its fun to customize Mace with the robe off of Agen Kolar's figure for a more ""complete"" feel. Don't forget to pick up Yoda as well so you have both heads of the Jedi Council!"
1,"Great potential, but horrible video","I got this camera because of the features and because of how well the DZHS300A version did in Consumer Reports. I thought, well, this is one nice camera. Well, when I got it, it must have ben broke. I used it for ten minutes inside, and there were all these grainy red pixels floating around the LCD. To make things worse, they also transferred to the video, so nothing you filmed could be watched. It was absolutely horrible. I returned it, and right now am waiting to see how helpful Amazon is at refunding my money. Let's hope that they are more helpful than this camera."
4,Moderation is the key to understanding,"Syd is a very interesting case and blown out of perportion. While I don't like all the songs on the cd rats being an example, I find that the cd is worth the money. I've been likened to Syd but with no drugs. that's how I discovere him. the cd is dark light beautiful ugly and a glimps into the mind of Rock and literary figures. It's not the greatest piece of work but it's also not the worst."
5,This One's My Favorite,"If you're looking for a dictionary of baby names, there are about a zillion other books out there to choose from. But if you've already looked at the typical baby name lists and were left feeling uninspired, check out ""Baby Names Now"". The authors offer real world wisdom and advice about each name. Each entry is clever and funny. Their descriptions are often completely subjective, but that's what makes this book so much fun. It really gets you thinking about what you do or don't like and why. I recommend it to all expecting mothers and fathers!"
3,Their research needs work,"Take a look at their write-up of the name ""Zelda"", where they refer to the name's use, referring to a Nintendo Character.One snag - They mistakenly refer to the Hero of the game as Zelda -- Which anyone who has ever picked up a Nintendo controller can tell you, is not the case.Link is the elfin hero. Zelda is the princess he must save, the point of his epic quest.What else have they gotten wrong in there?"
1,Not for us,"I didn't like this book for two reasons: First, the premise didn't work for us. My child put himself to sleep at night just fine, and then proceeded to get up every two hours during the night. Second, I felt the book was not well written. As a sleep deprived mom, I have to make the most of the time I have available to read. This book is so disorganized it took quite a while to figure out what Ms. Mindell's technique was. Most of the book didn't apply to us, but I felt I had to read the whole thing anyway just to figure out the sleep training. It is not clearly written or well organized."
2,Poor editing makes it tough to use,This book badly needs editing. The info I needed was spread out in different areas and I eventually gave it up. I even had a friend read some it and she couldn't follow it either.
5,A MUST For Parents,"This book is a MUST for parents. Dr. Mindell's advice is excellent, to the point, and parent-friendly. I saw Dr. Mindell on the Today Show and she was warm, wonderful, and knowledgable. I now give this book as a shower present to all my friends. My 9-month-old now sleeps through the night and life is bliss."
1,Not for Toddlers in a Bed,My husband and I have spent the last two weeks walking our daughter to her bed for 2 to 2 1/2 hours every night. The ideas in this book are good if your child is in a crib and cannot get out. This theory became a game that kept our daughter awake instead of sleeping.
5,Decidedly NOT vague,"I was anxious to find a solution that didn't involve crying. I purchased the no-cry sleep solution by Elizabeth Pantley, which I found helpful, but vague. As I searched for more information I stumbled on Jodi Mindell's book, and devoured the thing in two days. Some reveiwers don't like Dr. Mindell's approach because she advocates some crying, but I would argue that those people didn't read the book very carefully. Dr. Mindell advocates all of the solutions outlined in Elizabeth Pantley's book, but with more detail and explanation. She also explains how certain parental behaviors can CAUSE sleep issues. I learned that some of the things I was doing was making the situation worse. Bottom line, Dr. Mindell advocates crying ONLY after you have made all the other changes to improve sleeping behavior. Dr. Mindell's book is well researched and well written. It is evident that she is well credentialed."
3,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL BUT, STILL BLEAK AND DEPRESSING!","This film is not a true sequel to 'Open Water', but is another variation of the same theme....""being stuck in a situation with only a snow ball's chance in H E L L of surviving"".....the only problem is, in this film, the victims did have a better chance of surviving than in the first film and they just didn't see how, until it's was too late! I can forgive some of these decisions because under these circumstances, it's hard to think straight, but the ending was a little disappointing to me. It's pretty good as retreads go and it kept my interest, but let's hope there isn't a third film on this theme. It's not quite as good as the first film, but it's watch-able. Another film in my collection to depress my family, friends and.....myself. :-D I rate it 2 1/2 stars."
2,BE FOREWARNED: THERE ARE NO SHARKS IN THIS MOVIE,"This movie is mildly diverting at best... And shameful for insinuating there might be sharks by posing as a sequel to OPEN WATER. Be forewarned: There's not one shark in the entire movie. Sure, the premise is a big freaky and it's supposedly based on true events. But the characters do very dumb things and aren't very likeable making their situation eventually very wearisome for us viewers."
2,NO Paul CHapman,"A weak waysted cd.Doesnt compare to SYP cd or The good the bad the waysted.No Paul Chapman on lead.Save your money and buy Save your Prayers new release or UFO new cd,You are Here.A long wait for a weak cd.Chapmans release on his web site.Much better leads."
5,Bang for your buck,Book was helpful with planning out day with early and late risers. Very informative to help you plan out your day. Definitely worth the price to help you plan the day. Face it when you pay a lot for tickets you want to get the most out of it and this book definitely helped.
4,"A fun workout, but no lower body toning",I received this dvd and the tonin' rings and I really enjoyed the workout except there is no workout for the legs. Overall the workout is fun and I must say the energy is there without being over the top like other toning workouts by Richard.I recommended this video keeping the above in mind.
4,CAPTIVATING EYE-OPENER,"LADIES...}}}}This book exceeded my expectations & shed's a bright light on the PULPIT! Many times we put so much faith in leaders of the congregation versus in the WORD. We should be mindful that preachers are humans, they were not always SAVED, and still fall short!Great book & encourage all to read.Nicole we enjoyed your presence at our book club meeting and are looking forward to you joining us again for the sequel.ToyAllen, TX"
5,Oprah this is a must read!!!!,"The Sacred Sermon is truly a masterpiece! I enjoyed every moment of Nicolle Pierce writings as it dealt with real issues and concerns of today and yesterday. This is a page spinner, a book in my opinion that's unpredictable and a enjoyable read!! We here about pastors pimpin from the pulpit and there are those who pastor for self-gain in the name of Jesus.Pierce takes an angle that's not preachy nor does it attack anyone for their indiscretions and manipulations. Most readers will be wrapped immediately. It's an EXCELLENT read! I read it cover to cover because it was difficult to put down. I was very impressed!!!! Nicolle is in a class all by herself, I can't wait to review her upcoming novels.Dr. Phil tell Oprah to read The Sacred Sermon - Best wishes!"
1,No dialogue,"I purchased the season pass for season 4. Only episode 13 has no dialogue. All I can hear is the background music and the sirens. I played the video on my iPad and my PC to see if one of them was causing the problem. Since other people have had this problem as well, it looks as though they gave us the video with no sound. Since Amazon doesn't enable captions at all, this makes the video virtually unable to be watched."
2,What happened to all the music...,"Personally I like the music in ""Moonraker"" but was terribly dissapointed in the soundtrack album. There was only thirty minutes of music on the CD and the James Bond theme was no where to be found. What happened...??? I would of loved to hear the cue for the opening of the film where John Barry introduced his new version of the James Bond theme. Also I wish they would of added the cue for the Venice boat chase scene. I like the music on this CD, I just wish there was ""Moore""..."
3,Starrett Pin Vise,The photo in the advertising on Amazon is very misleading and leads any one ordering that you are buying all four pin vises. Starrett is the best and the three stars is because of the misrepresentation in the advertising . Amazon needs to correct this .
3,Needs editing.,"Inside Out claims to be a memoir of the blacklist and while the blacklist, HUAC and McCarthy trials are mentioned, it's mostly just a meandering autobiography. Bernstein needs an editor to shorten and break up these chapters to keep things more on topic. The first chapter is by far the best at covering the blacklist era and shows how it turned the film and television industry ""inside out."" The second and third chapters go back in time, covering in all of his childhood in one and all of World War Two in another. They also strive to build an explanation of why Bernstein chose to join the American Communist party but instead of presenting a well-thought and erudite discussion of third party politics, socialism and communism, he weakens his overall memoir with long winded, rambling tangents."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this because my REVO is starting to go. The bristles are too soft and don't grab your hair too well. Plus since it is electric you are tied to the wall. Found the REVO on Amazon as well, and will probably purchase it even though it is more. Definitely worth the money!"
2,Iron Eagle soundtrack review,Many of the really good songs in the movie are not on the CD. Including Gimme some loving and Old enough to Rock and Roll.
4,Supersweatin Party off Pounds,This may be just what the Doctor ordered. The encouragement to excerise and enjoy it!
4,"nothing very original, but a good collection of works","The story style, written at the turn of the century will make it dull reading for some, but to people looking for the myths of the Celtics this is a good starting place. One of Dover Editions, it has 76 illustrations and woodcuttings helping support the stories. Now of the works are very original, no fresh look at the lore and its meaning, as I did with artist Carmon Deyo in the THREE FACES OF THE GODDESS, my essays and Carmon's paintings, which has won awards and approval for the new look at lore. But they are a basic foundation of tales and for someone looking to start learning about the Celtics lore and myths, it is a very good starting point. It covers the religion of the Celts, the cycle of the Irish Invasions, the Early Melesian Kings, The Ultorian Cycle, the Ossianic Cycle and the Fianna and the Isle of Women Warriors.Highly recommended for those beginning the journey."
1,What the F?,"I grew up with and was a fan of the original television series so I gave this movie a try, and was incredibly disappointed. If it ain't broke don't fix it! ""The Dukes of Hazzard Movie"" is not good enough to be called bad. Every thing about this movie is horendous, the character portrayal, the storyline, the affects. My advice to anyone thinking about getting this movie is not to waste your time or money. Trust me is isn't worth it."
3,why did they put Jessica Simpson in this movie?,"I would have given this movie 5 stars, but Jessica Simpson is in it. Jessica Simpson is all show and no go. this movie is totally inaccurate, save for the General Lee. Boss Hogg is supposed to be short and fat, Roscoe is supposed to be middle-aged and dumb, the Duke Boys are supposed to be tall and skinny. they sort of got Enos right. Willie Nelson, however, was a crackup with the jokes he told."
2,Hollywood like !!,"Well to all you buyers from a big one to maybe another....I like the TV serie ...I don't know much about the characters on the Tv show ""rednecks"" or not but it was a hell of a Tv show. Ofcourse if they are gonna make a big movie about this you can not expect it to be just as the Tv show word by word or scene by scene. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was that they chose Burt Reynolds for the role of Boss Hogg but if you want to play a movie critic at a range of PERFECTION you are never gonna be satisfied ....it is acceptable,modern and fun to watch. It might not be the ""I gotta gotta buy it "" DVD for every one but it is good to watch."
1,One of the worst jumps from Tv to Movie,This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I probably should have known once Johnny Knoxville appeared as this 'JackAss' can not act.I was never a big fan of the original TV show but I did watch just about every episode during the first few years. I strongly suggest that if you even saw a single episode of the original series that you go and rent this movie and watch it before you buy it as you will soon discover that even a single star rating is far to high for this movie.
1,Quite awful,"Everybody said this movie was bad and not even Jessica Simpson made it worth watching. Did I listen? No. Will you? No. You'll think that it HAS to be worth watching at least a little bit because of Jessica Simpson in skimpy clothing, but let me just belabor the point: it's not worth watching. She is not in it enough to make it worth watching.Oh, and the story line? Terrible. In fact, I have to admit that I stopped watching this movie at the 20 minute mark, which is a rare curtailing for me; I normally make it a habit to finish movies but with this one there was just no point. I'd already seen enough."
3,Not as good as the Tv show,I grew up watching the TV show and had waited for a movie version to come out. What I got wasn't the Dukes I remember. That being said I won't stand on my soapbox and bash this movie like so many others on this site have. I'll simply say this if you like comedy that appeals to the lowest common denominator then this will be a DVD you will enjoy.
3,A mild disappointment.....,"First of all, the car is the star of thismovie. The car (a 1969 Dodge Charger) gets3 stars -- the actual actors get ZERO.The car chases, jumps and drifting areabsolutely incredible in this film. Theactual story was thin, the actors weremostly underwhelming and it really didn'tcapture the feel of the original show."
2,A little too predictable,"The whole movie was pretty predictable and cheesy at that. If you watched any of the TV shows, then you know the pattern and this followed that to a T, no updating of story line, just the actors playing the part."
3,Unrated? This is more like R-rating!!!,"I thought the move was great. There was a scene with a lot of nudity, but nothing with Jessica. Come on, i mean if they were gunna make this unrated they could have made a scene with Jessica topless, at the least.At the most, this is an R-rated version of ""Dukes"". I bought the movie thinking Jessica was going to show up either topless or completely naked, but there was nothing. Knoxville and Scott just dropped the f-bomb a couple times.I recommend that you rent it"
1,Stinks to high heaven !!!!!,"This so called director should be sued. As a 30 something who loved the original every friday night from season 1 through 4 (before Coy and Vance).....Coy and Vance look like gods compared to the cast of blasphemous characters to a classic and timeless show. First off....why was Burt Reynolds and not Danny De Vito casted as Boss Hogg? Why not Chevy Chase instead of an overweight villain known for playing a violent middleaged nut in ""Breakdown"" and ""Conair""...(MC Gainey)...MC... you are a very good actor in your niche...just not turning James Best's character upside down. I refused to see this in theaters and rented in (regrettably) even after hearing the derogatory reviews with an open mind.I can write a book about character mistakes and ruining the ""originals""....but I'll end it by saying the following to quote ""You took the name of a classic to sucker fans and boost ticket sales for what would have been a straight to video bomb if it was not titled ""Dukes of Hazzard."""""
4,Oh Snap! Takes You There,"Ricky Powell has a keen sense of ""the moment"" and capturing its essence through photography. If you were there, Oh Snap! brings back fond memories. If you weren't, it'll make you feel like you were. Oh Snap! captures hip hop at a time when it was teetering between underground grittiness and worldwide pandemonium."
5,Full of existential angst!,"Sartre's Nausea is a manifesto of existential angst, and ranks as one of the most celebrated philisophical novels of the last century. In his dairy enteries, the protagonist enters seemingly trivial details about his daily chores, thoughts, fears and acquaintances and through them reflects upon deep questions about his own existence and his being. Throughout the novel, the reader finds himself looking at his own self, his own world and identifying with the angst of one's being. A classic, must read for anyone who ponders on the meaning of the being, the point of our existence and is at war with himself. The novel does not necessary provide the answers to any of these questions, but provides enough spark to ignite the spirit of enquiry in one's mind!"
2,Didn't finish it,"I would have liked to finish reading this but 50 pages in I started to lose interest. There was a lack of motive moving the plot along after reading The Fall and The Stranger, I thought this would have been nice to read as well...not quite. Maybe I'll pick it up later on."
2,A book that could have been reduced to 10 pages,"""Nausea"" was a book that nauseating in the repetition of its theme. Over & over again I was given examples of the existentialist's universe that is indifferent to man's presence. There were moments that Sartre twisted, and invited the reader to ask ""well... why not?"" He challenges the value that we put on people & events while reminding us that this is all happening within a universe that doesn't care about our contrived evaluative mechanisms.Interesting ideas, but even for this already slender book, the ideas could have been conveyed in a 10-page short story. ""Nausea"" as a tale (without the philosophical element) isn't entertaining enough to stick with to the end. So, Sartre offers examples of his ideas ""ad nauseum."""
4,The Thorough Smell Of Existentialism,"French philosopher, Jean Paul Sartre's early novel Nausea is often cited as the essential book of Existentialism. The book follows Antoine Roquentin who illustrates the subject matter by living it in every minute of his life, on every corner and in every situation. The defeatist philosophy is neither negative nor positive. It simply is. It is the hollow essence of man. Having perceived this, Roquentin can not stand himself, the people around him, the objects revolving them and all related actions or outcomes.The bleakness extends to Roquentin's object of research. He too, not unsurprisingly, turns out to be an adulterer, a charlatan, unworthy and lacking worth. In short, both the story itself and the story within the story are lambasted in futility in the end.Wither in such a universe? Nowhere, for the illusion is by definition hollow and but a shell of nothingness."
4,Really Sick,"Sartre is a world famous existentialist of the times, and I think this wonderful novel really brings precision to the word ""absurd"". Objects are not what they seem... and physical sickness is due to his realisation of the absurdity of existence. What do you thinK??? READ THE BOOK."
3,Discussions are a bit convoluted.,"I took Functional Analysis from professor Demkowicz. Actually the course is a misnomer, since you learn very little functional analysis and quite a bit more about set theory, Lebesgue measure theory, and topology (through Ch. 4 in the book). While I feel that the book is very meticulously written, it tries to cover in too much detail everything starting from the most basic laws of logic. The proofs and explanations are concise and clear but for my taste I also appreciate a bit of ""plain English"" explanation before tackling a proof, so I at least have some idea of what is going on. Only get this book if you want an *extremely* detailed development of basic theory and don't care much about applications."
3,"Humourous, but bounded by time and culture...","I first bought this book, thinking it would be along the lines of Sun Tzu meets Frazier...I wasn't disappointed, but the '50s writing style is not fluid to read"
4,Fascinating and frightening,"This is a fascinating and frightening book. Although it is a work if fiction, it seems to be inspired by real events. Imagine if all of the worst things ever said about the Clintons were true. Now consider the implications of such people rising to power."
4,Good Narrative of Historical Takes,"Tompkins starts with an introduction to the genocide of peoples and desecration of the ancient Mesoamerican cultural structures by the Spaniards before getting to a very readable romp about personalities who attempted to preserve or ripoff Teotihuacan and other archeaological sites. The book presents a good overview of this site, which unlike the Giza/Egyptian pyramid complexes was not treated to in depth technical study until the 1950s and later. Even now, large portions remain unexcavated. The later parts of the book delve into Atlantean connections, a natural link with the speculations of Augustus Le Plongeon and others who appear earlier in the text. While it is not directly a history of the Maya, Olmecs, Aztecs, or others, there is enough citation within the interesting sidenotes and extensive bibliography to take serious readers into the bowels of the beast as of the 1970s, when this was published. All in all, this is a very nice little treasure."
4,Dash Condom!,"This silicone case is perfect for the dash. I've used my for several months and it has never worn any. The only buttons that are still tricky to use is the side volume button. Everything else is just about as easy to manage as it is without the case. When you get it, you might want to do what I did and take a nail clippers to trim the receiver hole. I wasn't having any problems with people hearing me, but the small amount of flash was just bugging me. It is a little bit of a pain in the @ss to do the battery-out-battery-back-in reboot, but let's face it...that's not something you will be doing very often. The reason I bough this case was to protect my Dash from scratches when I carry it in my pocket(which is rarely). It's not going to protect the screen, but I knew that. Also, it is a little annoying to get it in and out of a holster with the silicone case which has a tendency to stick. All in all, it is an excellent value for the price."
2,You can do better elsewhere.,"What's AT&T like? Lots of dropped calls, constant ""spend more"" text messages to your phone, lousy customer service and being nickel-and-dimed for every feature, like voice-dial. Ever wonder why 20% of customers churn to other plans every two years? Compared to Europe, all cellular service bites it, thanks to these ridiculous contracts. No motivation to retain customers. AT&T is just the biggest, far from the best."
4,"Sexy, soul with a little street flair...","Lloyd did a great job on this album, he mixes street hip-hop beats with a nice smooth, mellow sound. Reminds me so much of a young Michael Jackson...almost a little TOO much. But, it's still great. The Hazel song is about weed...LOL. Like that one, like Valentine, You, Get it Shawty...he's got some hot songs on here. I think any girl would love to have this in her collection to ride to in the whip."
1,It fell apart!,"I put this on my iPod and within the day, I not only found bends and dents from minimal usage, but the hinges came apart completely after being opened only a few times.Completely useless."
4,Cheap option for doubling zoom range,"This 2X teleconverter is a great option for anyone with a short telephoto lens wanting to double the zoom range without buying a dedicated telephoto lens. If your lens is slower than f/4 it will not autofocus in the telephoto range, but you can focus manually. Shoot at high ISO with a slower lens for best results, as it does restrict light. One added bonus is that the teleconverter acts as an extension tube, thus enhancing macro ability. All in all, it is a fun inexpensive device that seems well made and durable."
3,Handle won't move forward with filter in place???,"I'm using this machine, getting some good espresso, but have one concern. When a filter is in place, the arm will NOT move all the way forward as it apparently should. It works fine with no filter in place. I just checked some YouTube video demos to verify that it should move fairly easily ... but mine doesn't. It shouldn't take a wrestler to move forward, and then still is about only half-way forward.Any others having this problem???"
2,Didn't last,"We bought this in October 2009, and in November 2011 it started leaking while making the espresso. According to the manual and their website, it needed a new gasket. Unfortunately, it's not a part you can replace yourself. The only way to fix it and to get a replacement gasket was to take it to a service center. We only have one small-appliance repair shop in our city, and they verified it needed a new gasket. After 4 months, however, they still had not gotten the new gasket, so we finally gave up. It seems like for such a basic part, we should be able to fix it ourselves. We will not buy DeLonghi again."
5,De Longhi Espresso Maker,I bought this coffee maker from Amazon.com as a gift for a friend. She hasn't stopped thanking me for the past two weeks. She is absolutely delighted with the coffee the machine makes as well as the wonderful froth. It is definitely a winner!
4,Great Product,"This is a great product for the money. i was going to purchase another one - same brand - for double the price. glad I didn't purchase it.its works fine for me. i make espresso once or twice in the morning. I really didnt need any more machine than this one.the Creama is thick, the flavor with Bustello is fine, i can't ask for anything more.it has a tamper attached to it - so you don't need one - its there.only drawback is the cup location is not tall enough for anything but a small cup. even the small IKEA ones will barely fit.i have to remove the trays to fit the cup."
2,a step backwards for Delonghi,"Definitely not as good as my old unit..takes too long to heat up, directions say 15 min to 1/2 hr. Filter holder is so hard to turn into place it takes one hand holding unit securely and one on the filter holder. Definitely would not recommend."
1,takes too long!,"According to the operating instructions included with this espresso maker, the machine has to pre-heat for a total of 45 minutes before you can make a cup of espresso. I wish that information was available in the product description prior to purchase. I returned the item immediately."
1,"Poor taste, much money.","It's the first time I buy this brand of coffeemaker, and think it's the last. The coffee tastes like anything but coffeemaker, makes a horrible noise and is the first time I have to heat a pot for later use. For the money we pay, hubierse could buy two cheaper and better quality. Not recommended"
1,Dead Out Of The Box,"Quite simply, from the time of arrival this unit has never worked properly. It does not heat water so one is left with a tepid liquid. Returned and purchased a Krups."
1,No taste,The machine works ok but the coffee has no taste. The steamer starts and stops in the middle of frothing the milk. No clear guidelines on the grind of the coffee or how much to make for a cup of espresso.
4,good espresso for a great price,"This machine has the features of a more expensive machine at a much lower price. We have been using this machine daily and we are happy with it.Pros:Price + rebatePump design instead of steamremovable water reservoir1 and 2 shot coffee filtersmakes good espressosmall footprint, does not take up much counter spaceCons:built in tamper is a little messy (just get a handheld one)milk steamer and espresso outlet too close to counter, have to use small froth containerinstructions not clear about priming the pump. If pump is not primed, machine just sits and makes noise without brewing espresso.To prime: turn dial to the right espresso/hot water mode, place cup under milk steamer and empty brew filter, open steam knob on top of machine, wait until a steady stream of water comes out of steamer, now the pump is primed and you can make espresso, closing the steam knob should cause water to come out of the brew filter."
5,Wonderful espresso pump!,"The EC155 makes great espresso for an entry level pressure pump machine. I'm sure there are better machines out there for more money, but I'm having a lot of fun with this one and making some really good coffee. Do your homework to find what bean and roast you prefer and how much ""tamp"" you need and you'll be rewarded with excellent espresso and real crema. The steamer/frother function is easy to use for making other coffee drinks. The owner's manual is concise and easy to follow."
1,"If you want a facial with your espresso, this may be it!","I really was excited about this machine. But the problems started from the moment I turned it on. You need water in the machine to operate it of course, but the steam/drip doesn't seem to ever stop as it is supposed to--like when you need to take the gasket off to fill it. The steam sputters everywhere and I ended up always wasting lots of coffee and lots of time just for a simple cup. I sent it back."
3,Not much clearance.,"Seems an OK machine especially for the price. The main drawbacks are that the number of scoops is limited to 2 (level, not rounded) and there's not much clearance for the cup so you're pretty much limited to espresso shots. The same is probably true of the cappuccino wand, but I don't make cappuccino anyway. If you want something that will crank out a number of rounds at parties, go with a more heavy duty machine with more capacity."
4,pretty good for a cheap machine,"it's taken me a while to get the coffee right with this machine. it does need to warm up for 15 mins or so if you want the coffee to taste good. this is how it works for me, steam the milk first and before steaming milk, turn on steamer and let it empty any water that is sitting in the tubes until just steam is coming out, then steam milk. i tried papa nicholas coffee and that didn't work well, i have tried gevalla (?) espresso brand and found that makes a much better cup. coffee needs to be pretty well tamped down and full to the top of the container to get the right strength...had this machine for about a month now and finally ok with it. had a lot of watery coffee or watery milk till i worked out the quirks. but no-one who is a coffee expert is buying this machine, so it's not bad for a starter model for anyone who's trying to save buying from you know where. there are some videos showing how to work it on youtube which helped me."
1,Big Disappointment,"Although I was skeptical about this machine, after reading so many positive reviews, I decided to order it.I've had the machine for about a month. I've experimented with trying to get the flow to run 20-25 seconds, but it is simply not possible without producing a thin, tasteless ""espresso"".The machine is so light, that when you put the portafilter into it, you have to hold onto the machine to get it firmly screwed in. The water continues to drip after you turn off the machine. The filters do not fit firmly in the portafilter. Lastly, when you rinse it, coffee and water remain in it.I don't recommend this product."
3,Good for a beginner.,The DeLonghi is my first espresso machine. If I had to do it again I would start bigger. The good thing about this machine is that it produces a good espresso. The price tag is nice compared to others with the same pressure. It is easy to maintain and the it doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter. The machine also heats up fairly fast.On the negative side is the steam wand. It is very low and you will have to shop around for a pitcher that works well with the space limits. It works better as a single shot espresso maker than a double. The pressure limits the quality of the double shot basket.Overall I would recommend the machine if you budget is low. If you can stretch it a little or if you are a true espresso junky save up and go big. I am already looking for an upgrade!
1,"Vibrating like crazy, not enough room to fit a regular cup","Bought this brand new since most reviews were high. Got around to trying it after 2 months after watching a YouTube instructional video. Turned it on and it started vibrating like crazy. The shot glasses would vibrate off the stand. Also the filter handle would not slide all the way to front position. In addition, I could not fit the smallest cup under the nozzle. So this would only be good if you will be using only a shot glass. The good news is amazon offered a return or exchange despite the fact that it was past it's return policy. After reading other reviews of vibration and water leaking, I decided to return it."
4,Very Good,"I use this machine to make Ameircano's and Latte's. It works very well and makes great coffee. (Once I learned how hard to tamp the coffee.) The only problem I have had with it is when you turn the pump on, it vibrates enough that shot glasses will move around on it. This forces you to hold them in place and they become very hot. I bought an espresso cup to use instead of the shot glasses. It is heavy enough that it doesn't move around. That wouldn't be a problem if you drank straight espresso as you would already had the cups. All in all, a very good machine."
5,My first Espresso maker,"I never made esspresso before the purchase of this machine. The machine works great. I had Starbucks ground espresso roast beans (bold). I have also tried Starbucks Espresso Pods. The pods were easy to use and clean up, but I was not bowled over by the taste. Somewhat matalic. The ground coffee was superior. The tamping device came off but it works better for me that way. I love the machine."
5,Great espresso maker! LASTS FOREVER!,I've been through many espresso makers and this one has lasted the longest. I've had this for two years of daily use (at least four servings a day).It makes perfect espresso and very easy to clean.I can't recommend it enough.
5,Espresso Delight,"Great Espresso maker for under $100. It takes a little while for the water to warm up, but once it has it bangs out a double espresso in seconds. Makes luxurious crema. This is a no brainer if you are looking for a great espresso-Cappuccino maker at a price that is easy on your wallet.DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker"
4,working well,We used for a few months now and it works very well. The pump is a lot less noisy when comparing to other steam machine. I hope this machine will work for a long time. I went through 2 similar machines but different brand and each only last a couple of years
2,Great espresso while it works,"I have this machine for just over a year. It makes great espresso with nice crema for a while. It broke after half a year use due to water leaking from the milk frother when the top nob is off. The free replacement unit was a bit better. It failed to generate pressure to push through the filter pod after 7 months use. Consider the short life of this unit, $80 for a year use, I recommend getting something better to avoid wasting pricey coffee grounds in this machine when it just stopped working one morning."
4,Great Product! but why can't they write a better owner's manual?,"I've never used a pump type espresso machine before so the instructions were frustrating...but even my first cup of espresso was excellent. The instructions are a bit hard to understand particularly the part where is says to ""preheat for 15 minutes"" ...and then ""wait for a half hour""....which I still don't understand. But the machine works well and makes great espresso and cappuccino! Maybe someday I'll figure out the difference between pre-heating and ""waiting"""
2,Started out as a good product...,"When I bought this machine last December, I was very impressed with it. Yeah the frother wand is too low for most pitchers and you cannot fit anything except a shot glass under it but the taste was quite good (I would know, I lived in Italy and drank espresso everyday).This machine did not maintain it's level of quality though. In the last few weeks or so I've noticed the pump starting to sound weak and producing watery, flavorless espresso. Most recently I've noticed that the boiler is not getting anywhere close to the proper temp for pulling a decent shot of espresso. I used an infrared thermometer and it was only getting to 130 F. (54.5 C.) The shot's quality has gone from being dark, viscous and opaque to carmel colored, watery and translucent.Since the product is past the return window, I most likely will just be throwing it away. Very disappointing."
2,Design Failure,"We purchased this unit to replace a Krups steam model that has lasted 15 years. We have many other De'Longhi products that we have been happy with but this is not one of them. The Krups unit had more space between the base and the coffee filter. This unit limits you to using the cup or a low profile stainless container. The main flaw, however, is that the vibration from the pump literally takes the cups off the platform unless you hold them making this useless in my opinion. Finally, this unit is made in China, something I didn't see anywhere in the product description."
1,I may have return this item back to Amazon again.,"I currently have the second order from Amazon, due to the following:- There is no steam coming out, even without the portafilter in place, nothing but ~100C water drips down. it seems more drip coffee.- When portafilter is removed (after espresso has been made), beans are really muddy. I've owned other espresso machine before, but never seen anything messier.- The ""OK"" green lights ON time is very inconsistent.- It vibrates pretty bad, where I had to hold the cup the entire time when dripping.If anyone has any fixes for these issues, please leave me comment."
3,This coffee was not as good as that from an older DeLonghi which is no longer made. It is not strong enough,The coffee isn't bad -- just not good enough for the work it takes. I'll try to vary amount of coffee etc. to see if I can improve it.
5,Espresso machine for idiots?,"My wife was interested in purchasing an espresso machine, but neither she nor I had any experience with using them. We reviewed the machines on the Amazon site, and selected the DeLonghi EC155 model. When it arrived we read the instructions which were well written, filled the water reservoir, ground some coffee and packed it using the attached tamper, and made our first batch of delicious espresso. It couldn't have been easier. We are very happy with our purchase, as it reheats rapidly, and never leaves us waiting for our next cup."
1,Vibrates cups out from under the coffee drip spouts!,"The pump action causes a vibration that moves cups out from under the coffee drip spouts as others but suspiciously not all have noted in their reviews. I have tested this unit sitting on the floor and counter tops to make sure it was level and each time the vibration moves the cups out of position and the coffee fills the suspiciously deep overflow tray, did they know that this would happen? To remedy this problem I have to wrap a wet paper towel around and under the bottom of the cup to keep it in place. I would bet De'Longhi a pile of money that their R and D department knew of this blatantly obvious design flaw and greedily dumped it on the market anyways. Regardless of all the other negative reviews made here this one alone should send buyers fleeing to another coffee maker. Dishonesty will bring them bad karma and I am not one to refuse them their just reward of a one star rating. I hope and pray they lose business because of this review!"
4,Great machine...,Perfect way to have your coffee at home. One must make sure to buy good quality beans/ground coffee.
4,Great entry level machine.,"I use this machine 5-7 days a week. It works very well. The steam arm is placed a little low, so make sure you get a steaming pitcher with low sides. Love it. Starbucks has not seen my face since I got this product. No issues as of 11/10/10."
5,Great Espresso/Cappuccino Maker for beginners,"I purchased this item after much research. This first DeLonghi shipped had a 'bad' frother but the exchange process was easy and effortless. I was impressed and pleased. So far, the replacement has not failed me. My family and friends are impressed at how professional my cappuccinos turn out. I must say that fitting two espresso cups is not easy. The espresso spout for two cups are too close together but it is do-able. You have to make espresso first, then froth milk or froth milk first and then the espresso, can not do both at the same time. But this is a great way to learn and later on invest in a more professional model. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
4,Very happy with this so far,"We bought this about a month ago as our first Espresso Machine and it is working quite fine. Especially for the price we pay, we cannot complain!"
4,Decent enough,"I find the espresso it makes on the weak side, but my co-workers sharing the machine like it, so I guess it's a matter of taste. Very nice crema."
5,It's so easy to use,"I love my espresso maker. It's super easy to use and really easy to clean up after. It doesn't seem to make quite as good quality as more expensive machines, but it's great quality for the price."
4,works well,"I love this little machine... for the price it works well. I like to use the steamer to make euro style hot chocolates. Get an organic dark chocolate bar and sliver it up add a little milk then some good sugar (like coconut palm sugar or date sugar) and steam it into the milk so it blends seamlessly. Add a shot or two for a mocha or drink just the chocolate. I really love to do this at home with my own ingredients (like organic coffee, milk and chocolate) rather than rolling the dice on ingredients at Starbucks et all. After a few espressos you've made your money back."
5,Just as I had hoped!,"After doing my research on several models and looking at the Consumer Reports, I made my decision to get the DeLonghi EC155. I couldnt be happier. I'm a true beginner and after reading through the instructions a couple times and giving it a test run, I was enjoying a nice Mocha w/ foamed milk and whip cream. I noticed that there were some complaints about waiting 15 minutes but I was making it sooner than that with no problems. I don't have any complaints about the milk steamer. I'm being more realistic since this isnt a thousand dollar machine but this little machine foams my milk perfectly! So far I have no complaints. Great Price, Great Taste and saves me from driving out of the way for a mocha.."
2,You get what you pay for,"I get this machine and, like any other person who gets exciting when boxes of merchandise arrive, I open and use it right away. First off, it is Really, Really small. I had to tilt my smallest coffee cup to get it under the pump. That lost it a point. It does look fairly nice, but has problems. I made one or two cappuccinos successfully and tasted great. Also, the filter requires average-sized grained coffee. Smaller grains will not go through the filter, causing a soupy mess in the filter. I tried to make my second or third cappuccino and no water was going through. I called customer service to find out that my machine was defective JUST 2 DAYS AFTER OPENING IT!Pros:Looks nicegood tasting cappuccinoscheapCons:Commonly defectiveRequires medium ground coffeetoo small"
1,Only works intermittently- not reliable.,"We found this coffeemaker to be faulty within a month and a half of once daily use. Water temperature never reached optimum heat to make good expresso, and frother would only heat one small pitcher before quitting entirely."
5,New to cappuccino,"This is my first cappuccino maker, well I should say second because I did try the other model with the coffee maker and cappuccino together. The combo was terrible no frothing of the milk, this one is great! My husband does not like cappuccino so this model is perfect for me. I have used it everyday and so far it works great, froth is great. My only complaint is the frothing wand is to low to get a cup under easily. I still give it 5 stars."
4,Bargain,"For the price, this is a great machine.Need to use fine ground beans over coarse ground for the best results."
3,Lasted almost two years,"I don't know what the average life span should be for $100 espresso makers, but I would have hoped for more than two years. However, it made pretty good espresso with the ESEs while it lasted. The thing is...if I buy a $300 model this time, will it last six years?"
2,Delonghi Ec155,"Don't really like this machine. It rattles and moves the shot glasses when the expresso is brewing. Making you have to hold the glasses or the expresso spills. I have not tried using only one shot glass which may cut the mess. The large coffee filter doesn't hold enough coffee to make 2 full shots of expresso, which means I have to brew another shot for my 20 ounce mocha. It is nice to be able to steam the milk and make expresso without having to add more water and wait for it to heat."
3,Dies after 1 1/2 years,"This espresso machine was a wedding gift and it worked really well for a year and a half and then it just stopped heating water. I called the company and they said that it was not repairable and to toss it out. If it had lasted longer I would have rated it higher. One other issue is that it's not very consistent in the flavor of the espresso. We use the same brand, and sometimes it comes out without a crema."
3,it's ok,"this machine is 'ok'......I""m mainly after something that creates froth for my coffee...I use my old Gavalia machine for the coffee and this new one for the froth feature.....should have saved my money and got a frother on ebay."
4,Very good,"Is a small espresso machine. It makes very good espresso, the handle is very tough and the machine heats up very quickly. The water reservoir is small, maybe 3 lattes, not an issue, since you don't want to leave the water there for a long time. The only complaint is the steamer, is way to short. They couldn't make it longer, since the machine is small. I had to buy a 10oz pitcher, because the 12 oz just doesn't go well with this machine. We will see how durable it is. So far so good and great for the price. It has my approval."
2,It works for a little while,"It's a decent machine for the price. Unfortunately, I feel like I've outgrown the machine rather quickly (this is my first espresso machine.)It's FALLING apart though. I make several drinks a day and it's lasted about a year. Unfortunately, the housing that holds the espresso cup in place is falling apart causing me to forcefully hold the espresso wand in place so that it doesn't come loose and leak water/grounds into my coffee.PASS ON THIS MACHINE. If you plan on having an ""investment"" in an espresso machine pass on this model. You'll burn through the machine in no time."
4,Great inexpensive machine,"Bought this machine for a second home. This machine makes great espresso consistently. I have a much more expensive, higher end Rancilio Silvia machine, that is far more difficult to make consistently good espresso with. Hardware quality is not the same, but I would not expect it to be at a fraction of the cost. Curious how it hold up over time, but at this price it is very hard to beat."
3,Great machine BUT...,"works fast, great crema, decent price BUT..very loud, and it vibrates alot, the first one had to be returned because the cup wouldnt stay underneath due to the vibration from the machine adn the countertop shook. The machine doesnt feel cheap, but the vibrations make it feel so. Comparing the Nspresso and other machines that are now out, this one is bigger and possibly not worth the price. May be worth giving it a try since Amazon has a great return policy. But I would choose otherwise."
4,dE LONGHI EC155,"Overall the espresso machine makes a great cup of coffee. Certainly for the price you can't find a pump driven machine that makes the perfect crema every time. My only complaint is that the machine vibrates a little too much. If it had a bit more weight it would probably solve the problem. Still, for the money I wouldn't trrade it!"
1,dead after 45 days,"was great while it lasted, but after 45 days of use it stopped working properly. very disappointing. I am hoping DeLonghi stands behind its products"
3,Good for lattes and americanos.,"I got this during the holidays as a gift to the household. While a lot of people are satisfied with the little machine, my guess is they're making lattes and americanos. Not sure if it was my grinder or the beans, but for a 2 week period I could not pull a decent shot. I decided to step up to a Gaggia Classic (took the plunge after doing much research) and I must say, I'm glad I shelled out the extra $300. VERY WELL WORTH IT.I should add that I drink espresso, cappuccino, and machiatos. So the shots and its taste is very pronounced. I'm using a Breville Smart Grinder BTW"
5,Expresso Machine,"Have had the product for a little over a month now and use it quite often. Have been really pleased with this product. Makes wonderful lattes and is really easy to use. Takes a little while for it to warm up, but not that bad. Steamer works really well and makes a nice froth. Does drip water every so often, not sure what that is all about, but all and all does a wonderful job. I have to admit this is my first machine and I am not a professional latte maker, but have been told by my friends and kids that I make better lattes than Starbucks. I really like my espresso maker and would recommend it to anyone."
2,Worked for Only Four Months,"I bought this for my husband as a Christmas (2009) gift. He had read all the great reviews here and put this espresso maker on his wishlist. For about 3 and half months it worked great and made excellent frothy espresso. For the last couple of weeks it started to get slower and slower and produced poor tasting espresso with no froth. He followed all the suggestions other reviewers had about cleaning and flushing the machine, even going to so far as to take it apart and clean everything thoroughly. It still made bad quality espresso and after a few weeks of fiddling with it, we finally gave up. Big bummer, a waste of money and time."
5,cool espresso machine,I was skeptical to order this product and glad now I did. I got it as a gift for my son in law and after reading all the reviews I'm convinced all the 5 stars given on this product are correct. He will be impressed.
1,Great..while it lasted,"I loved this machine. It worked great for 6 months and stopped working all of a sudden. The wand worked, but not enough pressure for the espresso. It was still under warranty, so the company sent a new one. The new one was broken! Right out of the box, it did not work. I sent it back and the company has yet to send me another."
2,it finally completely broke after little more than a year...,"I bought this machine because it was cheap. While it ran it produced ok espresso.The first issue was that the steam nozzle wouldn't shut of completely. So while trying to make espresso, part of the water was always pushed through the steam nozzle. This is obviously not helpful.Next was a great leak. The water no longer stays in the machine, but leaks out the bottom. It's my own fault, I should have spent more rather than having to buy it twice..."
2,Not very good expresso machine,"First the good things about this expresso machine:1) It is inexpensive2) The frother works well3) Easy to add waterNow the bad things:1) It will only hold about 8 grams of coffee in the larger of the two filter bowls. This is half of capacity needed for an American sized double shot of expresso.2) The pump is weak. It will not pump water at an adequate rate thru what most normal people would call an expresso grind coffee.3) Most normal sized coffee cups will not fit under the filter bowl.Save your money for a better machine, I wish I had."
2,Good while its was new,"I have had this for a 1year and 3months, and average of an espresso per day. It quite on me a few days ago, it still heats the water and froths milk but will not put water through the espresso. The pump is on, i can hear it but it wont force water through the coffee. Its like it totally lost its power. When it was new it would make a great crema but month by month is slowly degenerated. I have cleaned it with vinegar(per instructions). I always buy fresh whole coffee beans and grind them with a burr grinder. So I am disappointed it didn't last longer. The space between the coffee filter and the base is very small so only espresso cups will fit. If it didn't break so quickly I would have given it 4 stars. Just bought the Mr. Coffee ECMP50 Espresso/ Cappuccino Maker. Made a few cups of espresso and cappuccino today and Am really impressed so far. Comparing both new I would go with the Mr. Coffee over this Delongi. Hope the Mr. Coffee lasts longer than this Delonghi ec155."
2,"Good when it works, great if it lasts","A great starter. The first unit failed within 8 months of regular use. The replacement unit (no hassle, yet very slow replacement process) failed after 10 more months of regular use. Both of them ended up with pump failures. All in all, a great little machine."
3,Not too pleased.....,"The main reason that I am not happy with this machine is because the basket handle does not move all the way to the front of the machine. It is locked in place but the position of the handle makes me very nervous every time I use the machine. It's just not right. I'm considering this machine my ""backup"" in case something goes wrong with my Gaggia. I miss my very simple, effective and very long lasting espresso machines from BRIEL. I have had three great experiences with that brand. Looks like they are just not making them anymore. They were great! I still have my original one from over 10 years ago! I would not buy another product by DeLonghi. The coffee always tastes burned."
1,Many hidden costs - can be a nightmare,"If you have a problem with the unit, your life will become a nightmare. I have tried on and off for over a year to obtain a part for my Delonghi Dehumidifier. They do not sell parts to consumers, instead trying to get you to mail the heavy device to one of their repair centers usually very far away. Third-party parts people I have spoken with were specifically banned from selling the part to consumers, though Delonghi officially claims this isn't so. All in all, I think I have wasted over a day of my life trying to get a small, simple replacement part for my unit. I will never purchase a Delonghi product again. Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand."
4,Bang for the buck!,"So I got this machine about 2 weeks ago. After a bit of experimenting I managed to pull really smooth shots! Very happy. The steamer works good as well. The froth tends to be on the watery side, but you still manage to make delicious latte/cappuccinos once you gain the skills ;) !! Over all very happy with my purchase. Of course I am not comparing it with an expensive machine, but if you're looking for a cheap entry level machine, definitely recommended. (The only question is, how long will this last? haha! Cause if it breaks, it definitely doesn't worth fixing as you will most probably exceed the price of the machine!)"
3,De'Longhi EC155 - Not built to last,"I like this espresso maker. I make four double shots every day. I used it for just over a year when it first failed. It was leaking water all over my counter. I'm experienced at small appliance repair so I took it apart. I do NOT recommend repairing it yourself unless you have the required experience. One of the two o-rings in the water pump circuit needed to be replaced. I replaced the o-ring (about $2.50) and got another year of use. Then, it failed again with another leak and also stopped heating. This time I replaced the other o-ring and a thermostat. Repair parts cost me about $20. It's working nicely again and continues to give me decent espresso. I got it for half price as a closeout from a big box store, so it's still a good value to me. However, I'm not impressed with the build quality."
4,Liquid Thunder at Jaws,"As one of my favourite films is ""Riding Giants"" I was searching for more similar footage of amazing waves and the skill and dedication of the people who ride them. I'm not a surfer myself although I swim, sail, have a great love of the sea and also photograph 'portraits' of waves. This film did not disappoint in any way although it could never be quite such a trip as Giants, but that is not meant as a criticism. What it does give is fantastic filming and cutting, good interviews with the surfers, photographers, jetski and rescue guys all nicely cut and pasted together with a well chosen selection of tunes to make a film which I will definitely watch again and again. The film itself isn't that long, but all the extras more than make up for that and are every bit as interesting."
3,DVD,"The item was shipped quickly, but when the DVD was played it skipped in several spots. Not sure if it was because I played the unrated version but no other DVDs skip in my player."
2,Don't see this movie,"They make fun of people with disabilities in this movie. I don't like when humor is making fun of others, so I don't like that. Please support those who have a disability. Don't buy or watch this movie!"
2,had a good plot but was ruined by the obnoxious crudity and stereotypes,"I was excited about this movie, but left the theater disappointed. Yes, it has funny parts, but the porn and nudity is unnecessary. Not to mention, I love how the wife with baby twins is a skinny as a rail, wearing size 0 clothes, wow - that's practical. Seriously? I know its just a movie, but still. It's not just a baby, but twins!!!I think the dialogue was funny for the most part. And Jason Bateman makes the movie worth watching, but definitely not worth owning."
3,Educational,"Believe it or not, but this lame screwball comedy has actually taught me a few things.First, Olivia Wilde will become one of Hollywood's leading lights, her onscreen luminesence even able to survive the outrageous stupidity of this movie.Second, Ryan Reynolds has deep insecurities as an actor, a complex not helped by the fact that she can't act. How insecure is an actor if he has to be constantly told by fellow actors he's good-looking?Third, parenting sucks. It really, really sucks. It sucks so much that you're better off being an unemployed actor whose job is trying to figure out how to spend all those minutes unemployment gives you."
3,Eh,"Some parts of this movie were funny, but other parts were too outlandish. I really like Jason Bateman, though, and I think that is the only reason I somewhat liked this film."
2,Too much nudity,"Overall I really liked this movie. I would have given it a 5 star rating except for all the full frontal nudity. It didn't seem necessary. The story line is amazing! I love all the interaction between the characters. I just don't understand why they had to put so much vulgar language and nudity in this movie. If they had cut that out to a minimum, the movie would be amazing. I loved the characters and it was very funny. Just wished they had made it a little cleaner. It had a light porn moment in the movie. So, if you don't like nudity and sexuality in a movie, then you won't want to watch it. I think guys will like this movie more then women."
2,Lots of cussing and bad jokes,"Some great actors in the cast but the story line is pretty cheezy as well as the comdedic qualities. If you like crude and corney humor, this might be the flick for you. However, if you perfer the wit and smart funny, I suggest you skip this one."
2,The same all over again!! Nothing new!!,"The plot was already seen many times on screen, especially here in Brazil, where we have a brand called ""Se eu fosse voc"" which follows the same plot of a change-up. Still, I gave it two stars because some scenes are funny and also because I've seen some movies which has no plot at all. At least, this has a premise of a change-up and follows this premise."
2,Gratuitous raunch cheapens quality.,"This is a 2011 attempt to freshen the hackneyed ""body-swap comedy"" that is unfortunately only halfway successful. It definitely has its moments. It starts and ends well. The middle is full of unnecessary raunch to keep the young guys interested. Hardly a classic. Not worth owning. Bateman and Reynolds are okay, but always play within their limited range. Leslie Mann gives the strongest performance of all. Definitely not for mixed company."
1,Uninspiring rehash of rehashed hash,"I realize the studios are risk adverse but endless repetition of the same old themes is really getting tiresome. How many times have you seen thematically similar story lines? Was it really necessary to create yet another version of the family man switches with successful single guy for our amusement and moral edification? What a boring piece of tripe. Note to studios; if I cared more about tits and crude humor than an intelligent plot line and acting ability I'd watch a porn flick. Get a clue, we aren't all fourteen and learning disabled."
2,Oh well,"Not for all family members, especially those younger than 12. I should have paid more attention to the trailer, then I would not have wasted my money."
1,Wow,"Absolutely terrible. No original humor - just recycled potty humor. I like Family Guy as much as the next person, but this humor is not smart, and it's not funny."
3,"kind of corny, kind of predictable","although there were some pretty funny scene's in the movie, it fell short of what I expected from the trailers."
1,Trailer very misleading...,"The trailer for this movie doesn't even slightly hint at the filth it contains. I never write reviews but I felt obligated to with this one. The f-bomb is dropped what seems like every five seconds and the nudity and sex should have given this film a rating of X. I am far from a prude and this was over the line even for me. The sad thing is, this had the potential to be a really solid comedy, but they ruined it. I wanted to watch a funny movie with my family, not a porn."
1,Really bad movie. The only thing good is looking at Ryan Reynolds,This movie is so crazy bad I could not finish watching it. It is beyond bad. The only thing good in it is watching Ryan Reynolds.
3,First 5 minutes were great.,"I like crude humor, and I feel Ryan Renolds does it best. We all know of all the changing bodies movies and what is going to happen. But, this one was pretty good. I had a few good laughs. It wasn't the best but, it wasn't the worst. But it was good enough for a lazy Saturday night."
3,Standard Romcom,"Good romantic comedy flick...not my first choice in movies. Entertaining, light, not as cheesy as I thought it would be seeing as how this has been done time and again since the 80's. Interesting twist that made it unique..I won't spoil it (its not earth shattering but I don't like spoilers)."
3,Fast service,"I did not study closely enough, and I did not realize this would be an 'R' rated film. The premise is hilarious, but the language lost me. I quit watching early into the movie and then have given it away, but that is MY fault. The condition was fine."
2,Change-up Review,"I bought this as a surprise for my wife, who was an extra in the movie (she wound up on the cutting room floor). Basically, its crude with a fair amount of nudity. It has a couple of really funny lines, but mostly it's just sophmoric humor that's not that funny."
2,Vulgar plot without much humor,"When viewing the preview of this film, you'll see the very few moments of comedy that have been injected into a bloated, lifeless plot. In sum -- two guys piss into a fountain and, magically, they swap bodies. Family man / lawyer is now a single party guy.This plot COULD HAVE been very funny. But, instead, the writers rely on very extreme scenes (i.e. a naked pregnant woman trying to have sex with Ryan Reynolds) that just aren't amusing -- they're disgusting. Finding the line between gross and funny is an art because anyone can be extreme and vulgar. It takes little talent to shout out bad language and think up extreme situations.To be funny, these guys should have followed some of the thoughtless, yet funny, comedies ---Wedding Crashers or American Pie. In fact, even Beavis and Butthead has better writers!"
1,Change-Up,The movie would have been really funny if it wasn't so raunchy. The profanity and nude scenes were not needed. The screenwriter and director should tell a funny story plain and simple.
1,BAD!!!,"Had to stop watching 20 minutes in!! Terrible movie. Not only is this movie completely unoriginal, but it is extremely crude. I would not recommend this movie."
1,BAD MOVIE.....,NOt funny at all just a few scenes made me laugh to much under the belt talk.... Why is it always that kind a humor Hollywood produces. Not good at all~
1,Awful!,"WAY out of bounds with cursing and sexual innuendos! It's a shame because it was totally unnecessary. This could have been a really funny movie with the cast it had, but it wasn't."
2,Not snappy,"I prefer cook books with color photos, times to both prepare and cook food and this one hasn't had much of a life out of the book case.It is hard to find good vegan cook books, I like the subject matter and that it does address food as a source of healing."
3,Just Average,"This is a middle of the road NIrvana biography. It offers straight, almost commonly known facts about the band, with little or no insight. This book contains information about Kurt Cobaine's early life, his joining with the band, information about the band, and information about his suicide. In this book a discography and a small time line are also provided. I would recommend this book to a new Nirvana fan who doesn't know much about the band, there are better books with more insight than this one on Nirvana/Kurt Cobaine."
5,This is the Solti to have...................,"The analog stereo recording is beautifully rich and clear. Bailey as Sachs, though a little unsteady at times, is miles better than Van Dam. Kollo sings well and with feeling. The ensembles are very well done and filled with high spirits. Van Dam completely ruined Solti's 2nd for me.The Meisters to own are this one, Barenboim's and if you like Fischer-Dieskau, Jochum's is excellent. The new Janowski is promising. Review to follow."
2,Ah..,Steve- this Operetta can be found almost anywhere. You need to look in the classical music/opera section of your local music store- under Sullivan...get a recording done by an opera company with opera singers- that is the way this piece was ment to be performed.
5,Excellent for learning to draw,I really enjoyed reading this drawing book. It was very helpful in teaching me how to draw from different perspectives. I believe that both novices and experts could learn some things from this book.
4,charming and lucid explanation of the shapes of the states,Feldman writes clearly and breezily about the surprisingly interesting subject of why the fifty states have the shpes they do. There is an article for each state plus several background articles that help set the stage. Appropriate and interesting for any reader from 8th grade up.
2,Unreliable,"I had the unit for a few months. It worked well before it broke--meaningless numbers scrolled across the display and buttons would not work. Tech support could not fix it. They sent me a replacement unit.Three months later, the replacement unit went down. Same illness. Called tech support and asked to leave message. Did so. They do not return my call.I expect better for a unit costing $1100+. I replaced it with a new Denon receiver that acts as an upscaler and as a switching hub."
5,"Great Price, great quality!",These were better quality than the ones we have purchased for years from Office Depot.
4,My son likes them,"The Marvel Heroes Gummies are definitely a hit at my house. They are sweet and just a little sour. Not chewy at all. They are so soft, almost melting in my mouth as I tried one. I would describe it more like an extra firm gelatin. The shapes are indistinct in shades of orange, red and purple. I am not sure if they are supposed to be anything.My son chose this vitamin and seems to like it. He happily takes them every day."
2,agree with J Stern-not a very good copy,"I made two data dvds and used the HP lightscribe discs. I wasn't very pleased with the outcome either. The pictures were dull and not very clear. To the person who gave it 5 stars don't think I don't know what I was doing..I checked all the color contrast from best to normal, picked what I wanted and the print still came out bad. I will be trying something else because the HP dvds aren't worth the money!"
1,Not worth the extra money for Lightscribe,"It really isn't worth the extra money to pay for Lightscribe CDs. When you do use Lightscribe, it does even look good. It is very faint and the writing is very small. Just use a label instead..."
2,"Average book, nothing special",Not the best technical refererence I have purchased. Although it has helped me out on a number of occasions.
5,Anna grandmother of Jesus,It's an exquisite book. It feels like your going along with Anna like a family member. It is enlightening and powerful
3,different,"The story was new to me so I've looked in my Bible for some reference to what was told in this story. Mary, Martha the Mother Mary is in the Bible. Can't find Anna. I don't believe in reincarnation into another body. I do believe in reincarnation of the soul by one giving our lives to Jesus by faith that he is the son of God. Once he returnes for us all mysteries will be answered."
4,recommend for families of Alzheimer's patients,"My mother is suffering from Alzheimer's type dementia, and reading this book made me realize she is not the only one. All of the author's symptoms & behaviors are the same as my mother's. Highly recommend it for anyone who has a family member with this sad disease."
4,CLAIRE MOORE AND MARIA FRIEDMAN ARE TERRIFIC!,"London has produced some of the greatest musical actors/actresses throughout time... Maria Friedman and Claire Moore are two exceptional singers and leading ladies. Their renditions (Maria - esp. Don't Cry For Me Argentina) and (Claire - Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again) are fantastic! The leading men (including John Barrowman) are very good as well. IF you are a fan of any ALW Musicals, this is a must for your collectiON!"
4,Fits perfect,"If you store your grill outside, even on a screened porch, a cover is a wise investment that will make your grill last years longer. The Ducane covers are heavy gauge plastic with an attached lining. Fits snugly so the wind won't be an issue. Hangs a few inches off the bottom to allow good ventilation. You won't be unhappy with this purchase."
1,Plastic was fused together...didn't open for a month and I'm beyond return date.,"Product arrived without damage to the box. I left it sit in my garage for a month before opening it and, once I did, I was unable to get the cover unfolded. I don't know if it is just old and sat for a long time or if they folded it before the plastic was cooled/dried, but the plastics are melted/fused together and ripped when I tried to open the cover. Unfortunately, I didn't open the product right away after receiving it. I figured with no moving parts, what could go wrong? I won't make that mistake again.*Update: As usual, Amazon's customer service is impeccable. Without question, they replaced the product, at no charge.*"
5,Great product!,"Have been looking to replace my Ducane cover. I wanted the same quality but wanted it to be a little longer. I finally found a cover at a Ducane on-line parts site to match my older grill but didn't want to pay what they were asking(almost double what I paid on Amazon). I took a shot on the 300111 cover and could not be more pleased. The length was perfect and the quality while a little less heavy than the original cover, far exceeded my expectation. This cover is well worth the price! The lining protects the grill and eliminates condensation."
3,Fits well but could be more durable,"We have had this cover on our Ducane 4100 for just over one year now and it fits very well and is a nice heavy weight with Velcro belts to tighten it at the sides, so it looks good and is good at keeping out the elements. However, the outer seams have started to come apart, despite the fact that the cover has been taken care of and not that heavily used, so it seems like there are some issues with design or quality control."
5,A great Album from a Great talent,Phil Perry is an exciting musician the music he brings is joyous. I especially like The Arms of Love
3,Only 39 minutes !,"This movie is nice, I bought it to see high quality WMVHD high definition content, but I'm quite disapointed that it only last 39 minutes, making it quite expensive for the length... I also had problem getting it to run on XP SP2 but resolved them by running the components directly from the command line as the support site indicated"
4,Great Versatility,"I like this wrap because you are not limited to one position. And it grows with baby. I had the Evenflow Snugli and my baby was only in it two months because he was so big (9lbs 1oz. at birth). This wrap is also much more forgiving on your back and more comfortable for baby. The only downfall - it is extremely long and drags the ground when you are putting it on. I just put it on before I leave the house when I know I will be using it. Like the other reviewer mentioned, it is a little awkward at first, but once you do it a few times you get the hang of it."
5,GREAT product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE this baby wrap!!!! I used it yesterday with my 1 week old, and it is MUCH better than a typical sling. It's more supportive, is VERY versatile, I can use it with my newborn OR my toddler, and the other babe goes in the stroller while we're out. It did not hurt my shoulders like other carriers have in the past, the stretchy fabric and the width of the fabric distribute the baby's weight evenly so it doesn't strain your neck/shoulders. I watched the video once, and it's easy to remember how to put it on. I HIGHLY recommend this, it would be a GREAT baby shower gift."
3,better for smaller babies?,"My son was born weighing 8 lbs and 2 oz. Now, at six months he weighs nearly 20 lbs. I used this wrap a few times when he was really little. It was August and September in the south, though. So.. you can imagine how an extra layer of clothing feels. It's a good product but didn't work well for me. Maybe if you have a petite baby it would work.. It definatly isn't our most used item."
3,"Good, but not great","My baby doesn't like to be swaddled so he's a little antsy in the wrap. Also i've had a little bit of trouble getting it tight enough so it won't slip down, but not too tight so the baby can still fit in it. It is comfortable though. I have 6 week old so i don't know how it is w/ older kids and babies who can hold thier neck up."
3,Fast shipping but not sure about the butter bur,"The butter bur capsules has black little specs in it, I sure hope it is still OK to take.We have bought this brand before from the herb store in my town and it did not have blackspecs in it !!!"
1,Completely Worthless,"The only ""idea"" in this book is this: ""Go to Tough Love meetings"". Of course, everyone there will be just as confused as you are, since Tough Love doesn't have any actual guidelines or strategies to offer (otherwise they'd be outlined in the book, right?). Oh, and good luck finding one of those meetings; I live in a densely populated area and there are none here.This book is basically a series of anecdotes. One parent went to her kid's school dressed as a clown. Another staged a picket line outside of her own home. I bought this book hoping for some REAL ideas -- instead I got useless drivel."
3,TOUGH LOVE,I haven't finished this book. It started out with too many case histories. I'm still looking for the part about how to correctly administer tough love to an adult child.I'll keep reading until I find what I'm hoping to.
4,Very Rare Terry-Thomas,A very rare British thriller with Terry-Thomas in a dramatic role. This little gem of a film is a real who-done-it thriller with a great climax in the Swiss Alps. Look for lots of familiar and famous British actors and actresses who make this a genuinely original drama which predates many films which copy its premise.
2,"Too superficial, WAY too much dupkicate information","This book suffers from having too much duplicate information and is way too narrow in it's treatment of Access. It seems the two authors have not communicated with each other at all. There are also quite a few mistakes in this book which indicates the editors have also not done their job. The content presented in this book could be covered in many fewer pages and would be more appropriate for one of Macmillan's ""Idiot"" books."
1,Unilever ruined this beloved old soap in 2009.,original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients. Now it has 24!it is not delightfully mild smelling or long lasting. I urge you to research this product before buying. I learned the hard way. It is not what you have fond memories of. Very disappointing.
4,Good but not great,"I had high hope for this tea because of some previous reviews saying, ""superior to anything I have tried."" It's not. I prefer the one I had before this one(see my another review)While it's not bad, it's no better than average sencha. What do you expect from the lowest priced tea you can find in amazon? Then again, it's a matter of taste, it can be very subjective.But for the price, I'd recommend it to the future buyers."
4,Practical Tools For Foster Parents,"I enjoyed this book, I found it helpful and well worth buying! I'm sure a few of my other Foster Parent Friends will also find this book useful."
5,Five Standing,"These episodes are some of the best in the series. I absolutely love the fight with the Toguro brothers. The acting by Justin Cook is fantastic. He has this yell that is so badass, I love it. I won't give away any plot detail, but let me tell you, stuff goes down. The fights are so awesome, I can't even begin to explain.Once again, the quality is good for these DVDs. Cheap, but they come with good video and sound. Missing some bonus features, but still great. If you're doubtful about Yu Yu Hakusho, watch a few of these episodes, and you'll be blown away."
3,Not really a photography book,"I would only recommend this book for big fans of Crewdson. It is not really a photography or art book, but more of a list of production credits from his Between The Roses series. There are photos inside, but none of them are larger than half the size of the page. It is nice to have a book that shows some of the work that went into Crewdson`s photographs, but if you are looking for something that highlights his beautiful photographs, I would go with something else."
2,Not typical M&D quality,"I wouldn't have bought these horses if I'd realized they were some cheaply made. They are hollow plastic with what seems to be a spray on fur. The colt's leg aren't straight and so it's rather useless. Still, they are good for imaginative play, I simply expected more from M & D."
2,"Great playing, not so much band","All of these songs have pheonominal sax playing. Najee has some seriously great phrasing, coupled with just enough chops to justify. However, the lack of organic drumming, the annoying interplay with ridiculously cheesy vocals, guitar playing that can barely make the cut, and a generally really lifeless new-wave production kills how seriously good this could've been.The title track, Buenos Aires, and Only At Night justify owning the album, but the album itself is definitely never worth another listen."
2,"Good Idea, Weak Implementation","The idea behind these headphones sounds kind of strange but they do actually make a significant difference in the feel of music that has a lot of bass.BUT...The problem with the design of the headphones makes the benefits somewhat moot. When I was able to get the ear pieces to fit in my ears properly (by holding them there) I was able to see what panasonic was intending by adding the vibrating component. But I had to hold them there and if I didn't the buds would pull back rather painfully on my ears. Furthermore, the sound was terrible because they wouldn't sit properly in my ears.I don't know if it's just that I have a big head (I do), or if it is just bad design, but these just don't quite seem to work as well as they could. If you like to feel bass these might be worth a try but don't be surprised if you find yourself returning them a couple days later."
1,Bum Battery,"Lenmar LBHP842A Replacement Battery for Hp Dm842A, 338794-001, 342661-001Took long time to charge this battery, but discharge time was very short.I may have gotten their only bad unit, but I would not take another chance on them.I really wanted to give it zero stars, but the program would not allow it."
4,Good sound but cumbersome..,These definitely make a good sound but trying to pack them in the woods is a little like walking to your stand with a marching band. I think you would be better off with the rack in a bag or pack a rack systems for quietness and convenience.
3,Across the water and into mediocrity,"Baby Boy da Prince - Across the Water (Universal Republic, 2007)""The Way I Live"" was a banger and which made me look into this album. I thought, here's a newcomer from the South who actually shows some promise. But boy, was I wrong.Basically, everything that can be wrong with a rap album happens here: the only good songs are the singles, (""The Way I Live and, to a lesser extent, ""Naw Meen""), too many skits--none of them good, and clichéd subject matter. Nothing about this rapper separates him from the other baby boys out there. Bottom line, if you had a choice between buying this album and buying extra diapers for your kid, buy the diapers. -EJR"
2,works...till they get used to it,"Works good until they get used to it. I used this on my boat mouring cover for seagull control and it would have worked if it stayed in place. Right @ the 2 month point, it breaks and then the seagulls get audacious enough to sit next to the broken off streamer. If it didn't break off, it would have worked. I replaced it and it worked until it broke off again right @ the 2 month point again. Too brittle after a time - maybe UV breakdown??"
2,I was happy UNTIL...,"I was very pleased and excited when I got this CD alarm/radio. The sound is good, the features work well. It's easy to figure out how everything works and to program the various functions. I loved it. HOWEVER, the second week I had it, CDs started to skip more and more (they play fine on both my other players), which is VERY annoying, since playing CDs to go to sleep and wake up by is mainly what I bought it for...so think about how you are going to be using this one, and how often."
3,Insightful,"I read this for my Anthropology of Inequality class, but we only read a few selections. I am looking forward to finishing it this summer."
4,This book opened my eyes.,"Paul Farmer is actually not a sociologist, but a doctor and is writing on some very social issues. This however would not initially be known from reading this book. In fact his perspectives as a doctor probably adds on to the authenticity of the whole thing. I highly recommend this book, and you have no heart if you do not have empathy with the seriously medically needy in other parts of the world after reading this book."
1,Overrun with rattlesnakes,"Snake Master Mike's review is discouraging because we are overrun with rattlers here in the hills of Northern California. There are dens all over our property sounding off with continuous hissing all day. Fish and game won't do anything, Home Depot has nothing for sale for this, and we aren't going to hire a backhoe or dozer like the enviros say to do. This is the worst year ever and our six cats are working overtime without success. It will cool off this month, but we need to get a solution next spring before the hot season starts. There ought to be a poison that will just kill them off. No such product seems to exist."
2,Disappointed,Not the quality I get of Hartz brand at Walmart. Very disappointed with this orders quality. I will not order this again.
1,Be CAREFUL if you are looking up by ISBN!,"Please note, if you are looking up a book by ISBN and this comes up as the ""Kindle Version"" -- it may not be! This is absolutely not the same book that I looked up. However, because Amazon often shows different versions of a book cover from the one you are looking up (with a notation that the one you receive will be the accurate one), and because it was otherwise unclear to me that this was NOT the same book that I looked up, I ordered it anyway. Four weeks into my class it's now clear that I have the wrong text book and will need to re-purchase.Amazon, PLEASE do a better job of indicating what books/versions someone is getting and do NOT offer other formats when someone is looking up a text book unless it is the EXACT same version. It matters!Boo!"
4,"Great CD, but not the best of HL&N's","This happens to a be a ""fun"" CD. The first five songs are fantastic, with ""Hit Me..."" leading the pack. The songs kind of fall from there, but ""Don't Look Back"" and ""Time Ain't Money"" are a strong finish. These songs are terriffic live! A must for a Huey Lewis and the News fan."
1,Only works in Summer,"This unit works great in the summer, save gas/money & gets very hot. If I lived in florid it would be great, but in south jersey, forget it. If you keep playing with the water supply to cut it down to a dribble & the gas as high as it can go, the water is warm. Forget about washing clothes in the winter in hot water."
3,A Little too Religous,". I understand that the authors are a preacher and his wife, but they are a little too ""religous for my taste. Good advice anyway."
1,Much in common with Muslim fundamentalists ...,"From 'What every man wants in a woman':'Do you know the difference between a woman with PMS and a snarling Doberman pinscher? The answer is lipstick. Do you know the difference between a terrorist and a woman with PMS? You can negotiate with a terrorist.'Guess he likes 'em barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen, where they belong. Maybe in a burkha as well?Aside from being rabidly homophobic, Hagee has a medieval view of women. He and the mullahs should get together and compare notes.Somehow, I just can't get a feeling of God's all-encompassing grace washing over me out of the pages of anything Hagee has written, or anything he has ever said."
1,Poor Quality - Extremely Disappointed,"I purchased 5 pounds of this product directly from Barry Farms for my grandmother's recipe fruitcakes. I was so disappointed in the quality of what I received. Of the 5 pounds, 2 pounds was of yellow pineapple that was inedible and had to be discarded. The pith of the pineapple was used rather than the good part of the fruit. There was no way I was going to use that in these high quality expensive cakes. Also, there was a lot of syrup in each tub, so I definitely did not get a pound of fruit. I ended up having to replace the bad pineapple at a local grocery store for twice the cost. I guess I got what I paid for. I will not purchase from them again. I just went to their web-site and there is nothing there. Maybe they have gone out of business. If this is an example of their product, I'm not surprised."
4,Prime Wolfe,"This book is a great way to aquaint yourself with one of the best--certainly the most exciting--contemporary American writer. The wealth of detail and penetrating insight into the origins of the space program, the men who rode the rockets, and their subsequent lionization make this book highly enjoyable.My only complaint--and it's a small one--is that toward the end it gets a little bit repetitive. Wolfe has a couple of metaphors that he extends through the entire book (the ""pyramid"" of status among test pilots, the astronaut as modern ""single-combat warrior""). In fact, these are the heart of the book and give some of the deepest insight into the space race, but after 300 pages you might be like, ok--I get it.I think Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test was a better book, but if you think that the 60's counterculture was a big waste of time and youth (and you've never partaken of its elements), you'll like this one better."
2,feh,"I enjoyed ""The Shipping News"", and think Wyoming is abeautiful state, so I thought this might be a worthwhileread. In my opinion, it wasn't. Ms. Proulx seems to dislikethe people, leaving no doubt everyone in Wyoming is aredneck, and every family abusive....Not bad writing, butdisappointing content."
1,Twisted,"Our book group picked this book. A couple people had started reading the book and shared at the last meeting. One said that she had a hard time getting into the book and was only on the first story. She felt that there was too much time spent building the characters. The other women who had started reading the book said that was what it was about, building the ""character"" of Wyoming. That was a great way for me to start reading the book. I couldn't wait to finish one story to get to the next. Then I read People in Hell... the rest of the book was hard to take. I found the book depressing, twisted and dark. Rough Wyoming. This book will provide plenty of discussion for our book group though. I guess this goes to show that as long as one can write well, you can write about anything you want and get good reviews."
1,waste of time,"I stopped reading Close Range about 1/4th of the way through, because it became obvious that Ms Proulx's agenda was not to tell interesting, insightful stories, but to show that ranchers and small-town folk in Wyoming, every man woman and child, were utter cretins who richly deserved the often violent end to their worthless miserable lives. We have many ""Southern writers"" who use their talents to perpetuate stereotypes and to demean a people. Shame on Ms Proulx for doing the same here."
1,"Save yourself time; rent ""The Twilight Zone"" video instead","Bad writing is bad writing; you read 100 pages, shrug it off, and move on. Writing such as Ms. Proulx', which combines such wonderful feel and imagery, giving one a sense of presence, can be insidious when combined with plots that are too gritty, too macabre, too out of synch with reality. You wind up reading the whole thing, hoping that just one of the stories will make it all worthwhile. In this book, it never happens."
5,A brilliant collection of gripping stories,"In some ways it's odd that Annie Proulx achieved such success with her novel The Shipping News, because she is a born short-story writer. This latest collection seems to me her finest work yet, illuminating the dark corners of human nature in language that is lucid, gripping and intense.The stories and the characters found in them are astonishingly vivid and stay in the mind long after reading. Proulx writes about people who generally have no voice in fiction, which is clearly off-putting to some readers. But the emotional truth in her work continues to grip the reader.I'm disappointed to note the number of Wyoming residents who seem distracted by the book's sub-title and feel it should be some kind of travel brochure for the state, and have reviewed it complete with sneers about Easterners. This is literature, not journalism!Fans of beautifully-written, emotionally intense writing should read this book! And also enjoy it for the beautiful watercolors."
4,super stickies,Used these for a brainstorming session; the large format works great and you can actually see what is written.
1,HOW can Memorex put their name on this product?,"I bought one of these items for my desk at work. Several days after getting it set up and familiar, the clock malfunctions and gains/loses time. The CD player then stopped working and, shortly thereafter, the radio as well. I got it replaced with the exact same item, only to have the CD player be so off-balance as to have the entire unit shimmy when a CD was spinning. Of course, the laser couldn't read the CD, so it didn't play. Worse yet, it's gone UP in price since I originally purchased it!"
2,Not a practical tool,"Perhaps my expectation of this being a practical tool was inaccurate. It is a verbose set of ramblings about dialog (or dialogue if you prefer). Communication is important, no question about that, but this is not a tool to help you communicate better. It talks about things like ""ecology of thought"". Many sections started with the exploration of Latin roots of words as basic as ""dialog"", that should give you an idea. This text may be of interest to researchers but it is not a practical tool."
3,"So, he had a spell checker, now to get an editor!!","A wonderful, challenging read -- made especially challenging for the lack of editing.The man can think, knows his stuff, and presents important ideas. But this man is not a crafter of high prose.If Senge had done a little consulting on smoothly flowing prose rather than the intro, it would have been better.Having had my quibble, I do appreciate the book and its insights which are many."
5,great studio effort,"For those who love Raq this album brings studio versions of live favorites such as ""Georgia"", ""Shirley"", ""BFAM"" and ""Carbs"". It's a must have for any fan of Raq or the jamband genre. Truly an album that can be listened to and enjoyed from the first track to the last!Two thumbs way up!"
4,What's missing?,"Great music and music making of course. But can someone please tell me why the song ""The Finer Things"" that Fagen wrote for the Scorsese film ""The King of Comedy"" isn't included. If I remember correctly it wasn't used in the movie. But it's a lovely tune brilliantly played by David Sanborn, so why exclude it from this set?"
3,No Bass,Very comfortable. Excellent midrange and treble. Very shallow bass. Poor outside noise blockage.
4,Great sound,These headphone have great sound at a good price. I've had them for abouth 12 months now and have run into any problems with them. They are VERY comfortable and look real sweeat. The coard is long a bit too long for my taste.
2,"simplistic, badly written","Having taught an undergraduate class using this book, I wouldn't really recommend it. The writing lacks punch, and many of the theoretical discussions are over-simplified or simply incorrect. (The discussion of causation is such a case.) For either undergrad or law classes, I'd recommend the more difficult but rewarding Kadish and Schulhofer text."
4,L.A. is the place,"A lightweight book with large type, big photos, and not too many pages is nonetheless interesting. This book presents the history of the LA Coroner thru the lens of famous and semi-famous murder/suicide/death cases.Richard Ramirez, Sharon Tate, Nicole Simpson, Elizabeth Short, etc., it's all in here along with some lesser-known but just as grisly events that occured during the 19th century era of Los Angeles.For people who are used to books such as Death Scenes, none of the stuff in here will really compare, expect perhaps for the photo of Marion Parker. Neither bloody nor gory, the photo still manages to shock with its extreme explicitness.Interesting, entertaining, and morbid. L.A. is the place for some DEATH IN PARADISE."
2,Interesting pilot episode but not a complete movie,"So many interesting ideas and situations are set up in the first half of this movie but not much comes of any of them. I like boring movies but this isn't one of them. Just, nothing much happens after the first 45 minutes. With almost 90 minutes left to go, something could have been resolved, some thread teased out. I'm disappointed."
1,wrong part number,"be careful when ordering this, right now p/n 70052 is a compression crimper for BNC, RCA and ""F"" type connectors.........you will not receive the DIY Crimp bundle if ordered......."
1,gerson therapy,"not the book I really needed. wanted the juicing recipe book only and do not ask for any further reviews, I have much more to do"
3,GREAT BOOK,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK ON APRIL 7th AND MY WIFE DIE OF AN aggressive breast CANCER ON MAY 6tH . JUST TOO LITTLE TIME TO DO SOMETHING . I RECEIVED THE LUGOL SOLUTION AND THE ENEMA KIT JUST TWO DAYS AGO. STILL WITH 4 TO 6 JUICE GLASSES A DAY ON THE CHAMPION JUICER AND A REGULAR strainer DID A 12.2 HEMOGLOBIN READING. SHE DIE VERY STRONG AND PEACEFULLY WITH SOME LITTLE PAIN. GOD TOOK HER QUIETLY.I,HER HUSBAND, WILL CONTINUE ON THE GERSON THERAPY.THANK VERY MUCH FOR THE HOPES. GOD BLESS EVERYBODY."
4,Excellent,"As a cancer patient unwilling to continue with traditional medicine after 6 monthsand being told my best option now is surgery, I'm thrilled to find the Gerson Method.Thanks so much for offering the book - I recommend it it for anyone thinking forhim - or her - self."
4,The many anecdotes and testimonials are a little tedious if you've already been sold on the program,"If you're already on board with the Gerson Therapy, don't need further convincing, and simply want the information about what to do and how the therapy works, then another Gerson book might be a better choice. This one has all of that information, still, but it is peppered with too many anecdotes and testimonials of people who were cured of their conditions. I haven't read other Gerson books, so I can't offer an alternate recommendation."
2,Ok,"The book was ok. Its a long slow read,I agree with somethings in the book but most people would not be able to afford the methods that they suggest. It is sad though that this cant be practiced in the US."
5,What the AMA doesn't want you to know!!!!,"I decided to change my eating habits in May 2009, found out about the Gerson way to eat healthy after dropping some weight. Went vegetarian prior to finding out about Gerson, and this make it solid in mind that vegetarian is the only way to go!!!!!!!!The AMA wants to give you a pill, so medical care follows these instructions. So don't follow these simple instruction, and let your doctor control the way you live, by giving you a pill for whatever ails you, while your body suffers the consequences."
4,Simply Profound,"(Quote) Most children are taught what to think, rather than how to think. They should be taught that their thinking is based on presuppositions.(End Quote)(Ham p.29-30) Mr. Ham writes profound truths in an easy to understand fashion. Great for high school students! Also check out The Lie, by Ken Ham."
4,The story of a horse-loving Amish boy.,"Reuben is the grandson of Daniel and the oldest child of Adam and Lucy Weaver. He is a young Amish man who struggles to prove himself to his friends. His horse, Princess, is his pride and joy, but she will also turn out to be his downfall. When he is dared to race Princess something happens that is shocking, but shows what not using good sense can do. Don't miss reading this exciting story of a young Amish boy."
4,"Good for my teenager, and for dad","I wish I could give a 4.5....This book has many short articles (5-10 pages) on different topics. This is manageable for a kid looking to choose a topic, or an adult who wants a good overview/review of the history. It's not comprehensive, so the Encyclopedia title is questionable (-0.5), but it was good for our 8th grader, and I (dad) enjoyed it too."
4,Worth it,I buy low carb items a lot. This one I'll buy again. It made Hot Cocoa well if you mix it correctly. I add a little Coffee Mate French Vanilla to it. The smell reminds me of the old powdered milk days. That smell I don't care for but it mostly goes away after mixed. If you have to have low card Hot Cocoa this one wins my vote.
5,candied fruit.,It was very good. I bake fruit cakes each year. This was better than most that I have tried. I recommend it.
3,Sleep Aid....,Relora will make you very relaxed. You have to take a vitamin B Complex with it. It didn't help me for appetite control at all. Lina was correct. I did start taking them at night to help me sleep.
2,Relora 300 mg.,"I read all of the great reviews for this product, but it did not work for me. I had such high hopes that it would, but sadly ,no. I must say, however, that the company that sent me the product, Swanson Foods, was fantastic! The Relora was at my home within the week ordered. Great company."
2,Meh,It didn't help my appetite. If you want something that works try ACE. It will kill your appetite and help you lose that awful water weight. I lost 9lbs in the first 9 days. lose-weight-with-ace.lovemyace.com/
4,Challenging But Fun,"This video is available right now on my On-Demand Cable station. I've completed all three of the segments and I have to admit that it was a challenge for me especially the concentrated abs section. However, I feel that each segment was well worth the time spent. I will probably purchase the DVD once it's no longer available on on-demand. After using many videos with many different instructors, I find that this one is one of the few that will be effective and not boring. I recommend this for intermeidate to advanced users. I think beginners would find some sections too challenging, but something that they could work up to."
5,"Remarkable insights, with rumblings of the social revolutions of the '60s and '70s.","Baby boomers will recognize the freewheeling emotions and impulses described in this book about the late '50s, because these were ours in the '60s and '70s. Joyce Johnson's own transformation, and her close observations of her beat companions and the intellectual stew of NY in the late '50s, give hints of what will happen to America in the following 15 years.In particular, the author has a unique ability to articulate the feelings female baby boomers absorbed growing up, before the feminist revolution swept us away in the early 70s. As a small example, she points out how girls reading adventurous novels (like On the Road) didn't separate themselves from the guys but fully inhabited the male characters. Male narrators are not a problem for women the way female narrators can be for men."
4,Well-written and Gripping,"This memoir recounting a young woman's years spent in the inner circle of Jack Kerouac is well-written and gripping enough to hold its readers' attention. Placed firmly in the center of the Beat Generation, her story teems with indecision and insecurity, the desire to get up and go, leaving responsibilities at home to see the nation and experience life.-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"
3,Fragile,"This product was very nice while it lasted. However, I attempted to shove a bigger piece of ice into the shaker from a bag of ice and it literally shattered it. I realize that I shouldn't have tried putting in such a big piece of ice but a metal shaker would never have had that problem. The shaker also looks more plastic in person than the picture which makes it look more like glass in my opinion. But once again, I really enjoyed this shaker before I broke it."
3,"Good film, DVD not as good as theatrical version","I saw the theatrical version of this movie about 3 months ago and just got the DVD release. I thought the film was great when I saw it in the IMAX theater at the Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. However, the DVD just didn't look right to me. The vibrant colors that I saw in the theater were not there and the soundtrack was not transfered very well to either DD 5.1 or DTS 5.1. The DVD was a disappointment. The video quality of the ""Making of"" feature was not worthy of DVD release.I own about a dozen IMAX films on DVD. This and another one that I bought at the same time could have been better. Both were released by Image Entertainment. I have gotten some real low quality DVD releases from Image Entertainment and this continues the trend for me."
1,Mediocre product,"I compared these to the Sony noise cancelling headphones (MDR-NC5).I found they didn't reduce background aircraft noise as muchas the Sony did, and they were much less comfortable. Whenyou are wearing headphones for an entire plane trip comfortmatters quite a bit (to me at least...).I'ld pass on this product."
3,They DO work,"These headphones cancel a proportion of ambient background noise. The claim is only a proportion so in an aircraft you still hear the engines, but with a worthwhile attenuation. The effect is more obvious with low frequency noise.Benefits:fold up neatlystore in handy bagcheaper than Sony cancelling 'phonessound reproduction is a big improvement on airline 'phonesbetter sound exclusionmore comfortable tooGripe: Since they are so suited to air travel, why dont they come with an adaptor for Boeing aircraft?"
1,NOT a good workout!,"I am a belly dancer and I thought I might like this DVD because Hula is SO similar! I was looking forward to it but was very disappointed.DETAILS:I DID NOT like this ""workout"" at all. The first 10 minutes are fine - not bad at all. After that it becomes mundane and VERY BORING. It is VERY slow moving and yet . . . there is NOT ENOUGH CUEING.Since this is targeted to beginners the instructor should have BROKEN DOWN THE MOVES to make them understandable and more doable. She DOES NOT do this.MY SYNOPSIS:Beginners WILL get LOST and the more advanced will be BORED.This DVD did not hold my attention and was NOT it a good work out. I'm sorry. I have to say thumbs down! God bless."
2,little practice,"I have no knowledge of Hula dancing and I expected a bit more practice than I got. The starting part she tells you what the dance looks like and then it goes right into the workout. I did not see where she trains you or teaches you the step by steps at all to each type of thing she did. Obviously, because the workout goes right into it, I had a terrible time keeping up as I did not know the steps. I think I would buy another video that gives you much more practice than this one though I could see how it would be a good workout if you knew what you were doing."
5,Movie Scenes Come Alive,"The Neverending Story, the soundtrack is part of the reasons why the movie became so successful. Title theme Neverending Story and Bastian's Happy Flight are the uplifting themes which will surely make you want to see the movie.(Atreyu's Quest and Atreyu Meets Falcor and Happy Fight are basically the same as Bastian's Happy Flight but with a bit of different touch). Moody scores such as Swamps of Sadness and Gmork depicting the swift and sly movement of wolf-like evil creature vividly conjure up the part of the movie scene. It is no doubt one of the finest 80's soundtracks. The movie is as great as the soundtrack and the novel has slight different theme from the movie. Both are highly recommendable as well. Also recommended for Harry Potter and Lord of the Ring appreciaters."
1,Never buy this one.,"I bought this Apple humidifier in early November. It stopped working soon at the first time I used it. I later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again. You have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got replacement. However, the new one has the same problem, and what's worse, it leaks!! I talked to the manufacturer again, but they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do!"
2,waste of money,"we received it with broken cover. It didn't work properly and stopped running every hour. We tried different ways to make it run, but nothing worked. We've returned it. It's just waste of money.On the other hand the COW-humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well. No complaints."
5,Christmas present...,This is an awesome lil guy to show your team spirit they look amazing and are adorable lil men! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a cool little gift for someone!
5,heroes in the making,"Read the stories of Jeff Leeland's life & the heroism of the children he has known, they are heartbreaking & heart warming.Rebeccasreads recommend every parent & teacher read DISARMING THE TEENAGE HEART -- if for no other reason than to remember how magnificent our youngsters can be, if we encourage them."
1,This is not Fu**ING Down,THIS IS NOT DOWN AND NEEDS TO BE OUT UNDER DOWN! ONLY ONE AND TURE DOWN! DOWN NOLA LIVE FU*KING ON!
4,Worth it for Baker Street and Right Down the Line...,"If you are a fan of mellow-early-70's music then this CD may be just for you, at least for Baker Street and Right Down the Line. The rest of the CD leaves a lot to be desired, but it's not THAT bad. The other songs just don't give you that soul-tingling, melancholy, sentimental, lovey-dovey feeling to the extent that these two particular songs do. All in all worth the money."
2,Good and Bad,"I didn't really care for many of the songs. Most of them had a base beat that was very irritating. I found that the songs I loved all came from the original ""City to City"" album which were, and still are, very original and moving."
2,Wrong Turn...Not Right Down The Line!!!,"15 songs and they couldn't manage to fit ""Home and Dry"" , ""Days Gone Down"" or ""The Royal Mile"" among them?!!! The sound isn't so hot either!!! EMI has had 20 years to revise and get this collection right and has failed on all accounts!!! Not the Best of Gerry Rafferty by a long ways!!!"
3,"A good listen, but no Home and Dry","I've had this CD for a few years, and it's worth having for the great song ""As wise as a serpent"". But as far as Rafferty goes, ""City to City"" is the best."
5,perfect bread,"this book is wonderful! i have made several recipes, and each one comes out perfect. if you love bread, or love making it, or know someone who does, get this book. it never leaves my kitchen."
2,avoid this version,"This version (with the split cover) used an inferior source and switched the channels, the new ESP version with the black cover is from the master tape and has infinitely better sound!"
2,this sucks,This book was barely up to par. From the beginning I couldn't understand what Frost was trying to depict. Most of what he said was nonsense that didn't help the book progress at all. I couldn't even finish the book because I got too bored! Frost has written better books.
5,Simply The Greatest Golf Book Ever Written,"Mark Frost takes you back to the beginning of the American golf boom. The inspiring detailed account of Francis Ouimet's 1913 US Open is just one part of this wonderful historical book. Frost takes you through Harry Vardon's career and Francis Ouimet's childhoods, with background of all the great British golfers at the turn of the century. He then traces the growth of American golf, with the stories of John McDermott, Long Jim Barnes and a young Walter Hagen. All participants in the 1913 US Open.Until reading this book, I never understood the impact of Ouimet's win on the careers and lives of Gene Sarazen, Bobby Jones and Francis' caddy, Eddie Lowery, and American golf in general. This book belongs in the hands of every young golfer, just as Francis Ouimet grew up with and was inspired by Harry Vardon's ""The Complete Golfer""."
5,Awesome book,I've now read a couple of Mark Frost's books - and I'm absolutely blown away by the level of detail and depth he provides as background to his stories. The details are fascinating in their own right but make the overall story that much more compelling.
1,Chocolate Cr*p,"This book was one of only four that I, in this lifetime, have thrown across the room. It was the worst kind of mystery drivel, with ridiculous and contrived detecting by amateurs and a parade of shibboleths and caricatures. The scenery comes across as written by a tourist rather than a local, and the protagonist is in no way sympathetic or likeable.Hands down the most disturbing thing about this book, however, is the bold racism that comes across in Fairbanks' depiction of characters of any ethnicity. Foul."
5,Non-commercial industrial music,"To me the the second-to-best album. ""Last Rights"" will forever stand as their finest moment, at least for me. But even Skinny Puppys second best is worthy of a full score. They are up there with Throbbing Gristle, Coil and Einstürzende Neubauten. No cheezy industrial dance or rock, just the avant-garde of the fringe of the music industry.""Too dark park"" is shedding the last traces of 80's electronic music and EBM. This is aggressive, angstridden, desperate - pure industrial music. The subtle rythm of Ogres vocals are there, the hard and dark industrial beats pound each word and chords into place. This is music for those who miss something in their music - the real thing."
5,Surprised how much I like it!,"I had an plain, old, black travel coffee mug with a lid (keep bugs out) that I used for diet coke when I'm outside gardening. Some creep stole it right off my front step! I couldn't believe it till I looked at the prices of new ones. $20.00 plus!This cup was the most affordable. It has a lid, keeps my soda icy cold, and doesn't get half as grimy as I'd expected. I wish it had a handle and sometimes it's tricky to get the top screwed on right, but those are minor. Besides, I love how pretty it is!"
5,love,I LOVE THIS CUP I ACTUALY BOUGHT IT FROM MY JOB JOANN FABRIC LOL FOR LESS CUZ I HAD A COUPON LOL
1,BAD MAKE,"I just got my ""traveling cup"" not too long ago and so far i am utterly displeased!!!!!! Fist of all when i got it it did not come with the straw it said it would so i had to buy my own! Secondly there is only one hole (for the straw) so you can only take one small little sip at a time!!! And lastly i can't put it in my backpack because YES, it will spill/drip in my bag!!!!! Over all i am not happy with this cup!!!!!!"
3,Not the La Cava version.,"I just don't know what to say about this version of the 1936 classic. Niven is suitably cast, but for the life of me figure out why Allyson was chosen here. I'm being very generous with three stars here, only because this 1957 remake tries hard to come up to Gregory La Cava's 1936 original.Where this version falls completely flat it's in the ensemble work, which is so important to these screwy comedies. In spite of workable efforts by a few, especially Niven, there's no comparing this with the original.Grab La Cava's original on Criterion, instead. Unlike this production, it will not disappoint."
3,David Niven was simply not William Powell,"OK, I have been spoiled by watching the William Powell version too much. But, I remember seeing the David Niven version in the late 50s, never saw it again on TV, and thought I would buy a copy because I remember enjoying the film. And, it is enjoyable. I like to collect different versions of the same film for comparison: Sabrina (Humphrey Bogart vs. Harrison Ford), Thomas Crown Affair (Steve McQueen vs Pierce Brosnan), etc. And, I am glad to have this to compare. But, there is little comparison between William Powell and David Niven as Godfrey. The Thin Man wins, hands down."
1,Satire Masquerading as Sincerity? Let's Hope So!,"After two viewings I can still not decide whether Herzog meant for this film to be taken seriously. It has the look and feel of sketch comedy. I am not a discompassionate person, and I literally laughed my way through 2/3 of this thing. One of my favorite moments was the clip where Dave Letterman asked Treadwell if we'd be hearing reports of him being eaten by a bear, and then the audience erupted in laughter--COMIC GENIUS!Treadwell was clearly insane! Not brave! Those bears didn't want or need him there! So what is the story if not the novelty and irony of this closeted, kooky wannabe hamming it up for the camera and then getting exactly what he was asking for.If Grizzly Man is satire, then it's a masterpiece and Herzog is a genius. If it was intended as inspirational or tragic docu-fare, then it fell far short of its mark. The guy, the situation, the foolish-looking supporting players and the ultra-serious narration were all just laughable."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to a documentary on grizzly bears and quite frankly, found only a delusional young man, romping through the Alaskan wilderness, trying to make friends with the bears. While I can appreciate the footage of the Alaskan landscape and wilderness, that is about all I could appreciate. Had I known that it was a crusade to save the bears by communing with them, I doubt I would have rented it. That said, I am glad I only rented it and I guess I should have known more about Treadwell before I did. I was supremely disappointed, having a rare evening to watch something other than my 5 year old son's movie picks. A waste of time. The plight of the grizzly is not helped by this lunatic's ravings."
4,Wild Life,"This fascinating documentary has many aspects to enjoy such as real-life tragicomedy, unique up close video of the bears and a cast of Alaskan eccentrics in the background. The contrast between subject Treadwell's moon beam emotionalism and narrator Herzog's heavy German realism is unintentially hilarious and has already been parodied. Personally I'm much more comfortable with Herzog's approach; grounded by his pessimism he does at least stay on planet earth while we can only watch the flight of Treadwell's indulgences with amusement, disdain and a hint of admiration. You have to admit he did do amazing things even if he was essentially an idiot. Come for the nature footage but stay for the human drama."
3,"To be, or not to be... food","Most of us are very careful, when we put ourselves in a situation that places us at less than the top of the food chain. The subject of this documentary has a flawed perspective and pays the awful price for his arrogance."
4,"The ""Bear""-ed Soul","Mad genius German filmmaker Werner Herzog spins a documentary unlike any other. What emerges is a portrait of a truly unique individual; Timothy Treadwell, the man who spent 13 summers living amongst the grizzlies. Never exploitative, and never boring, Herzog seems to hope to learn about the Grizzly Man in much the same way he tried to learn about the bears. You really do have to see this film to believe it--astonishing."
1,if you care about wild animals,"If this man actully cared about bears, he would have left them alone. The only thing that he did was make them more use to humans which is dangerous for the bears. Plain and simple, don't feed the bears."
2,Grithly Man,"Reviewers rave about this doc., but I think it takes a special kind of person to watch some California space cadet lisp his way about verdant meadows of azure green for almost two hours without laughing yourself ill. I lasted 5 minutes,42 seconds. Frankly, if you're not rooting for the Grizzlies to gnaw this cretin's head off long before the flick is finished, join a seminary. You boast a saintly tolerance for world-class stupidity. That said, the Grizzlies looked appropriately menacing."
2,Sad Commentary,This movie was hard to watch. It was a sad commentary on Tim's life and how far from society he removed himself. Some of the footage of the bears was great. I enjoyed the Alaskan scenery but the great shots were far and few between. The interviews were over acted it seemed like and hard to watch. I couldn't watch the whole thing (I skipped a few interviews) but kept watching in horror because the story was just so sad.
4,Touching....,"Though tragic, its a wonderful film. We can really feel his love for the bears and the animals in general.Giving 4 stars only because it would have been nice to have some more footage of critical scenes.A must watch for all animal lovers."
4,This is not a nature film.,"Not a ""Gorillas in the Mist"" with gorillas = bears type of thing. It is a psycho-drama documentary.This is a story about an adult man who sleeps with teddy bear, regrets not being gay, lovingly caresses real fresh bear poop and constantly tells the bears he loves them and is there in the bear country to protect them from something unspecified.All the malicious stereotypes about tree-huggers get masterfully verified in this film.The bears either didn't care for his protection or didn't understand our hero as well as he had claimed to understand them, and so it took them 13 years to finally have their delegate make some mano a mano communication. As a result of this encounter the involved individuals abruptly depart from the land of the living - and thus our brave hero successfully achieves his goal in life.For mature audience only (thankfully, it's R-rated). Worth seeing once only."
1,The coroner seems to be as mentally ill as Treadwell,"Regardless of your opinion about Timothy Treadwell, I think we can all agree that this filmmaker was a bit lazy throughout the entire documentary. With hundreds of hours of footage shot by Treadwell himself, in addition to the wide variety of interviews, I don't understand why this director decided to narrate over 75% of the film. Maybe he just liked the sound of his own voice.Worst of all was the scene around 50 minutes in where the coroner describes the state of the remains he received and what he examined. I honestly wonder if the coroner was as mentally diluted as Treadwell. The man seems to almost relish in the gore while he overacts throughout the entire scene. The good doctor clearly thought this film was all about himself, rather than the victims he examined.If Treadwell is the uninformed, kitschy version of Steve Irwin; than this coroner is certainly the kitschy version of Bill Nye the Science Guy."
3,Film of the year for The Darwin Awards,"...and I agree with Cpt Kirk's comment about the world's longest suicide video. Truly great amateur footage of great bears in the wild, but to use T Treadwell's own vernacular: ""Yo, Dude! Those are predatory beasts which should be left alone, by you, and others who would encroach upon their habitats."" I know Treadwell never meant to harm the bears, but I can't help thinking his attempt to bond with them did more harm than any sort of good."
1,Stupid and Infuriating,"Wow. This was hard to watch, because it was so terrible. Treadwell, was a misinformed-- egocentric...um lunatic. This man did a disservice to animals and the environmental movement. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film. Totally stupid."
5,Amazing,"For those familiar with Herzog's previous work, ""Grizzly Man"" does not disappoint. Based on the life and work of Timothy Treadwell, the film gives every possible angle one could want to its subject. We hear from ex-girlfriends, parents, local specialists, and surgeons, ech of whom offers a different perspective on Treadwell's work and its significance.This film easily makes my 2005 Top Ten List."
2,Not really a water toy,"I got this for my one year old to make the bath time even more enjoyable. But this toy doesn't stay completely afloat and it barely moves in the water. On the other hand if you have a hardwood floors ... beware! This toy will pick up such a speed that when it hits the wall it flips itself upside down, and it suppose to change direction (like described in product details). I am giving it five stars for durability, because it is still in one piece."
2,Understates negative impact of logging,"Mr. Taylor accurately identifies most of the causes of the salmon population crisis facing Washington state, Oregon, Alaska, and British Columbia. And he is dead on in his assessment of the impact of farm fisheries on salmon ecology.The book grossly understates, however, the impact of logging on salmon habitat. Without canopy to cool streams, temperature-sensitive salmon simply cannot spawn successfully. And let's not overlook the role that clear-cutting plays in causing erosion, sedimentation, and flooding. It's true that salmon ecology can still suffer from genetic contamination by farm fish, point-source and non-point-source pollution, illegal overfishing on the high seas, legal overfishing in fresh water, damming, and overuse of water by irrigators and developers. But let's not downplay the egregious impact of logging."
3,"don't lose that disc, whatever you do.","Sure, this Audio Player is tiny and compact and will wow anybody that you show it to. Sure, the small storage disc makes it easy to fit many, many songs.But if you lose that software disc you get when you first buy it, then there's no point in ever having it in the first place.Even worse, you could still have the disc and you'll never be able to use it ever again. If you lose the case that the disc came in, you would have bought all this in vain.The serial number for the disc is needed to install in into your computer, but if you lose the case which tells you the serial number.... then you're just in trouble.I have not been able to locate a new SD Jukebox software anywhere, and since somebody accidentally deleted my SD Jukebox program from my computer, I'm left with no means to rotate my songs.So, if you decide to buy this portable audio player by Panasonic, don't ever lose that disc. Even if your life depended on it, don't lose that disc."
5,Great Video! My kids love Horatio!!,"Both my kids absolutely love this video - they are mezmorized by Horatio Lion, as well as the colors, sounds and songs in the video. Whenever my 10 month old is crying, I pull out Horatio Lion and it calms him right down. My daughter also loves it and walks around singing the songs. I highly recommend this video to anyone with young children, it is not only entertaining for them, it's even educational!"
5,john/jimmy..kirk/johnny,"this movie should be given its place in any western collection.much as another fabulous western 'the man who shot liberty valence', it deals with a 'west' that has changed beyond the main characters' capacities to understand.and, in common with countless westerns (of the a, the b, and the c varieties), it all comes down to who fastest, ¿no? or does it?both the leading characters are riveting in their own ways,and ¡the ending! oh my, what an ending. whew.this is a fine western, definately watchable again and again, and therefore definately buyable.alvin"
3,Not bad but not brilliant either.,"This movie is not bad. It's a tad bit long. There really needs to be a tad bit more magic to this film to hold a candle to the likes of other films like ""The Others.""The movie seemed to drag a bit for me. There were several instances where the movie overflowed with recumbency which also led to me checking my watch to know the time. Let's just say that if I'm enraptured by a great movie I don't pay any attention to my watch or the time.The subtitles are also flashed on the screen at such a fast pace which makes for difficult reading. Luckily my Spanish comprehension skills are developed enough that it was actually easier for me simply to listen and not read. This is, however, not the case for everyone.I wonder how well this movie has done here in the states since it is nearly seven years old and yet I'm the first person on amazon.com to review this movie. Hym..."
4,A quick read that deals with supernatural occurrences.,"This was the first Velda Johnston novel that I have read, and I was impressed. The book is very quick to get through, and you won't want to put it down. Published in 1980, the story is about a young woman named Susan, who has lost both of her parents. Soon after her father dies, she meets a wealthy man named Martin, at a Manhattan secondhand book shop. Martin is a widow who has lost his wife Irene in a plane crash. Both Susan and Martin become acquainted, and shortly afterwards, marry and move to his home in Maine. When Susan arrives at the house, she starts experiencing headaches. Shortly afterwards, she involuntarily becomes involved with supernatural occurrences caused by Irene. The rest of the story deals with Susan's fight to fend off these strange supernatural occurrences. Although this book is 20 years-old, it is entertaining and I recommend it."
2,Auto-reverse function gets jammed,"The auto-reverse gets jammed on mine. I stick in a tape, and in the middle of the tape, the player auto-reverses back and forth, back and forth for no reason. Other than that, I guess it works fine. But of course, the only reason to buy this is for the auto-reverse, which doesn't work."
2,Could be better.,"I find this Jesus really horrible...just remember Neeley, or Balsamo, or Gillian...where are here the high notes? Mary Magdalene is awfull and the only one here that seems to know what he does is Judas. A great voice!!! Not the best but good."
2,Disappointed with the verse.,"Here Comes Mother Goose was disappointing to me. On page 26 and 27, what are little girls and little boys made of have the verse reversed. Any good editor should have found that error. The book on the whole was a disappointment to me."
2,Little to recommend...,"Father Panic's Opera Macabre, originally published separately by Subterranean Press, is also included in the Leisure edition of Tessier's Finishing Touches. This novella was nothing but disappointing, with such an evocative title leading to little more than grand guignol -- and bad grand guignol at that!Neil, a historical novelist, has his car break down and has to spend the night with a beautiful woman in a strange mansion. The cliches abound, and Tessier drags things out to the point that very little happens for the first 70 pages (out of 125); and when things do start happening, the complete lack of creativity ensures that the villains will be Nazis and the end will be predictable.Having this sorry waste of pages tacked onto a solid novel makes for a sadly uneven experience -- although at least you won't have to pay $40 to find out."
1,"Cute shoes, but definitely not fo rme","I ordered these because they looked like very cute ballet flat type of shoes, and they had good reviews here and elsewhere. When I got mine... they fit horribly. Uncomfortable to say the least... I had the Return label printed, the shoes reboxed and back in the mail within 20 minutes of getting the box open. Its too bad that they didn't fit me, because I really like the design."
5,An Excellent Selection of Poems,"The value of any poetry anthology to an individual reader depends on that reader's personal tastes in poetry. I was pleased to find that many of Mrs. Onassis's favorite poems were also favorites of mine, including ""in Just-spring"" by e. e. cummings, ""The Pasture"" by Robert Frost, and ""The Lake Isle of Innisfree"" by William Butler Yeats, which was beautifully sung at a memorial service for John Kennedy Jr. The book includes several other selections by Frost and Yeats, as well as wonderful choices by Robert Louis Stevenson, William Shakespeare, and many other poets, and beloved verses from the Bible. There are also some original poems by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, a fine poet herself. I especially liked her ""Thoughts"" about autumn and ""Meanwhile in Massachusetts"" about President Kennedy. If you enjoy poetry, I think you are bound to find some of your favorites here, and you may find some new favorites that you haven't seen before."
5,Finally the videos,"Oceania- her first single the video is stunning with beautifal computerized effects.Who is it- Very good setting for this song I like how she is in the middle of nowhere it makes for a great setting.Triumph of a HEart- Very good idea to take it back to basics. THe audition mix is the best version, I like how the people are beatboxing.Desired Constellation- THe vidoe may be simple but the song is very good.Where is the line- the most graphic video from Bjork if you thought pagan poetry was graphic wait til you see this one!! I call it the invasion of the GRASS people!!!"
5,Triumph of a Collection,"This is the perfect capping for Bjork's Medulla era. Every video here is more inventive and original than any she's ever done in the past. Ranging from the utterly gorgeous Oceania, to the pop-like bell-induced version of Who Is It, to the mellow artful Desired Constellation, to the fun hip-hop dance number Triumph of a Heart, to the eery Where Is The Line. These videos can be appreciated by Bjork and art fans alike, but not by the mainstream public. And maybe that's a good thing."
1,Simplistic and unfair,I did NOT enjoy this book. I am a convert to Islam and find this book to be simplistically written and completely biased.
4,Sweet Baby High Chair,This is a super cute and durable high chair. It was easy to assemble and my daughter loves playing with it. The eating tray slides in and out and my two year old gets frustrated that she can't maneuver the tray herself back into position. But that will come with time. It's large enough to fit a variety of dolls and sturdy enough to last a long time.
4,It's almost not a toy,Santa brought one for my 1 year old and my 4 year old got another one from her grandparents. They're very sturdy -- even enough for my 1 year old to sit in it.
5,One of the best imaginations,"Don't let the cover fool you...this story was one of the best written fiction novels to read. The plot and storyline was excellent. I like the works by this author. At first, I thought it was government related with a boring story ...boy, was I wrong! It's a cliffhanger until the end...keep up the good work, Mr. Johnson."
2,I still don't get it,"Okay, I decided to buy this book to read while I waited for an order to come in. I am so confused. I'm halfway through the book, and I keep saying 'huh?' to myself as I'm reading. The book has potential; however, it seems to be under-developed. Maybe things will be clearer for me as I approach the second half. I almost want to stop reading this book and start a new one."
3,Confusing,"THis book was okay for a thriller. I don't ususally read thriller's but I read an online review for this book and thought I would pick it up. First of all the characters in the book were kind of confusing. One minute something is going on with this person and then it skips to another character. I read the book in one day only because I wanted to know what happened to the twins Jerry and Terry, who in the begining I thought were 2 brothers. Like I said the book was okay and I gave it 3 stars and that was kinda high I think."
4,Kept me on the edge,"It was the bomb Keith.I cannot wait for Pretenses. This was my first murder mystery. You have paved the way for me to open my mind to murder mystery's. I could not put this book down and when I had to, I was anxious to get back to it. Hurry with Pretenses. You have me curious!"
5,A moving tribute to a giant of the 20 th Century,This DVD should have been much longer because it was so interesting and fascinating on a historical and personal level. The images and historical contents are just incredible and it is a tribute to the late pope John Paul II who has allowed us to see these historical images of his own funeral proceedings and rites of succession.
3,"Good for Traveling, Certainly Not Perfect","The book is about traveling, so I supposed it`s fitting that it works very well as a travel read. I read the bulk of it on a 13 hour flight to Japan, and it set the stage well for my travels.Sutcliffe does a very good job of expressing the feeling I often have when I`m done with a trip: that I`m glad I did it, but I don`t know if I would want to go through the whole experience again.That said, much of the book seemed like it was missing something. The story is told from a first person perspective, which generally gives the reader a wonderful insight into the narrator. However, in this case, I never felt like I truely understood the narrator. Close at times, but never quite fully there."
5,One of the funniest books I have read.,"I have just finished this book and, as a Brit who took a year off a while ago, found it one of the funniest books in a long time. Anyone who has had time off travelling, especially Brits coming across other countrymen on their trip, will identify with it: Dave, the sardonic yet amiable cynic; Liz, the try hard; Jeremy, skillful in his condescension, and, of course, The Book, a traveller's bible. Guarantee you laugh out loud at some point."
5,A romp of a novel!,"Despite having been a language major in college, I'm just now starting my global travels as an adult and can begin to appreciate the stories and attitudes in this novel. Sutcliffe captures the essences of the different types of stereotypical travelers. This book is laugh out loud funny!"
4,"Good reference, but could have been better.","This book provides lots of reference drawings, sorted by type of clothing. What I didn't like was the emphasis on some clothes, that don't really differ from others pictured on the book. The other thing I didn' like was the incomplete drawings. Only the first pages have complete drawings, while the rest have only upperbodies, legs, or fullbodies, but without faces. Given the talent of these artists, it would be very easy for them to provide complete drawings, with faces and expressions that match the poses. Summing up, a very good book, very useful for the manga artist that already knows how to draw bodies, but needs some help getting them dressed. Special note on the final secction, about folds."
3,VARIETY!,"The only reason I'm giving this book 3 stars and not 4, is because the way this book was organized, was a little confusing. It's always hard for me to find a certain peice of clothing in it. I had to flip through the WHOLE book just to find a pair of friggin' pants. Other than than that. This book was very helpful to me. it has lot's of good ideas, but sadly, nothing as creative as the characters on the cover. TRUE, I usually find myself guiltily judging a book by it's cover *Slap self in face* I can't help myself! You'de think I'd have learned by now! But I would definetly reccomend this book to people who KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING! But as the title of this revew says: VARIETY!"
5,Very engaging,"Bought this on the positive Amazon reviews from others, and I now agree that the raves were right on target. Some interesting facts on the sun and our relationship to the sun, as well as the expected beautiful photography. Well done."
4,Visually stunning!,"This film is only for people who prefer to view visually stunning images and video, or for scientifically curious people, or for people who could be called ""sun worshippers"", or people who love to be awe-inspired. Anyone else left should not get this DVD."
4,Great Upgrade for the Budget Gamer,"The 7600GT is a nice upgrade for those short on change and looking to make a noticeable difference in the games they play. All of my games(BF2, Civ 4, Call of Duty 2) jumped to the maximum video settings. Also, the regular everyday graphics(icons, backgrounds, photos) seemed to pop out more. It gave everything a more realistic feel. I would suggest this card to anyone looking to:1. Upgrade two or more year old graphics cards.2. Buying first card to replace integrated(on-board) video graphics.Tech Info: It comes with two DVI and one S-video connections on the back. For those that still need the VGA plug, the box contains two DVI-to-VGA adapters. Also, remember it is PCI-E and not PCI or AGP."
2,"Interesting, but accurate?","I've followed Mr. Quinn's writings for several years and foundthem to be generally helpful. Yet I often feel that, with each book,I have learned as much about the author's attitudes as I have the subject. I have found Mr. Quinn's later works to be heavily interpretive. It is easy to be impressed with the sheer number of the footnotes, but the question remains whether the sources safely stand for the cited proposition. In any event, Mr. Quinn's work ventures into a field where little other information is available, and is helpful for that reason."
1,At Least It Isn't plagiarized,"One cannot complain that Dr. Quinn has copied his work from someone else--although that includes an accurate quotation of his sources. Before taking this book seriously as scholariship (it's great gossip if one is into that) randomly select 25 footnotes and check them out. Probable accuracy: 5 of 25. And the other problem is, without checking one doesn't know which 5. That's the advantage of lots and lots of footnotes: there is an appearance of eruditon, without the risk of disclosing egregiousness."
4,hot sauce,"I am a teacher, and I'm upgrading from using Garageband on the mac to using Reason and Protools, so that my youth can develop the necessary skills that people in the industry are looking for.If you don't know Reason, then the DVD tutorial is a must. Even then, to get really deep into it, you may consider taking a class or getting mentored by someone who uses it alot. It is dramatically more complicated than Garageband, but it has so many more possibilities.Reason is not for the beginner, but if you do start with it, get the support and it won't let you down."
4,Excellent recreated sequences of Egyptian life and times,"Haven't seen the DVD, but saw the IMAX and found it very enjoyable and filled with nice sequences of Egyptian life recreated for the film.Especially interesting were sequences showing the painted statuary and walls in Egypt...many people aren't aware that they were painted since the paint has worn off most outdoor displays.The story, with Omar Shariff and a niece, helps keep interest of young people and others not aware of other attractions found in Egypt. A 40 minute survey of Egypt, well and colorfully done, much attention to detail and historical niceties. A real plus!"
2,Very Basic review of ancient Egypt.,"Great for a student or anyone who is looking for an introduction to egyptian history. Slow moving for most adults. There are wonderful videos on egypt ,that are much more informative and exciting to watch."
2,Not the best DVDs on Ancient Egypt by far,"This set is just ok. The information is dated and the interviews are uninteresting and bland. The scenery is wonderful and that alone makes it an ok video experience. But if you are looking for good information in a dynamic presentation check out the various National Geographic dvds on ancient Egypt. Also the ""reenactment scenes"" are laughable. The ancients did NOT wear gold lame...come on even plain linen would have looked better."
3,"Bit Disappointed - Hardly any ""Mysteries of Egypt"" to see","This was an excellent documentary on Egypt, with stunning footages and photography. But if you are looking for real Mysteries of Egypt and the investigative report on them, this surely is not the video you shall look for. From historical point of view and general overview of ancient Egypt, it certainly is a good one.The title is rather misleading......"
5,PERFECT LEARNING,IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE. LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE MYSTERIES OF EGYPT. THE WAY THEY HIDE SECERTS THAT WAS NOT SUPPOSE TO FIND. GREAT FOR ANYONE THAT WANTS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT EGYPT. THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW.
1,Still uneaten...,"My cat tried to get a few chomps in, but then could not be coerced to eat them, even when cut into smaller pieces. Seemed pretty hard, but ok smelling. Definitely, two paws down."
3,good for cats that like to steal pens,My cat likes to steal pens and pencils and then chew them. these are the same shape and the smell of chicken keeps him enticed.
3,They won't even try to chew on it!,I have two 3 year old cats one female (Luna) one male (Titan).... I used to buy crappy supermarket treats just to give them something different... We rarely give them treats... But a year ago my vet told me Luna might have dental issues in the future. I was hoping to get something that would make them chew more! Bc they jus swallow everything and their getting a lot of tartar build up! But this didn't work as well as i wished! If you guys have any recomendations.... Please let me know!!!
5,Not for writers only,"What a great read! This book is for anyone who needs to be reminded of what they are capable of, whether it is writing or living up to their potential in other areas. Fun and informative."
4,Good for the price,"These headphones are a very good pair for $20. They do not distort at high volume and have relativley good base (compared to the $250 studio monitor heaadphones by panasonic). They are very comfortable but the ajustments for the ear cups wear out quickly, for they are made with not the best plastic. Overall good headphones!"
5,Nice,"I want much more of this one, it tugs out the heart strings and makes the violin play at your emotions, questions all those out there that are neets and introduces this idealism to the west that if you are not into development of the mind, body, or financial status then what you can do is still extraordinary, but it still takes much effort and good friends."
4,Pretty good mattress topper,"I bought this and thought I had heeded all the warnings- it smells like hell for a few weeks and takes forever to fully stretch out and inflate, but I guess I was expecting it to be a bit comfier. It IS comfy, but I had hoped for more. It's ok, I guess for the price, I think next time I'm just buying a better bed."
3,Smelly,Comfortable but really smells. The manufacturer said it would take 8 hours or so to air out. Let it air out for a day after receiving and have even put it out on the veranda for a weekend and it still has a smell to it. Have had it over a month now and there is still a gassy smell to the mattress.
1,Buyer Beware !! It Stinks!!,My parents bought me this matress topper for Christmas and I have to return it already. The foam smells so bad that it turns your stomach. I followed the istructions and put it in a well ventalated area and put a fan on it to help the smell ware off. Not the case ! Four days the topper sat under a fan with proper ventalation and still smells awful. By awful I meen like a Plastic factory. Just discusting. Spend the extra money get one from Costco that doesn't smell like a factory. Not to metion the product was about inches to short. Ummm.. which part of my bed do I want to not be covered?!
4,SEEMS OK SO FAR,"WELL WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE IT WAS BASICALLY SHRINK WRAPPED IN THE PACKAGE AND AFTER A HUGE EFOORD OF TUGGING AND PULLING IT FINALLY CAME OUT. AT FIRST I THOUGHT I GOT THE WRONG SIZE AND WAS WORRIED, IT LOOKED LIKE A TWIN SIZE WHEN IT WAS OUT OF THE PACKAGE AND FIRST PUT ONTO MY BED, DIDNT FIT AT ALL AND I ORDERED FULL SO I CHECKED THE BOX AND THE BOX SAID FULL(DOWNSIDE, NO RECEPIT IN THE BOX WHATSOEVER!). WELL AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OF IT SITTING OUT IT WAS THE RIGHT SIZE. IVE NOTICED SOME PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SMELL AND IT HAD A MILD SMELL BUT IT WENT AWAY AFTER A FEW HOURS OUT OF THE PACKAGE. IT SEEMS KIND OF HARD WHICH WILL BE PERFECT FOR MY HUSBAND BECAUSE HE LOVES A HARDER SLEEPING SURFACE BUT I WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT. I GAVE IT A 4 INSTEAD OF 5 BECAUSE GETTING IT OUT OF THE PACKAGING WAS A WORKOUT IN ITSELF. OTHERWISE IT SEEMS WELL WORTH THE MONEY I PAID FOR IT!!!!!!!!!"
4,Perfect and great price,"The perfect way to upgrade your mattress. Comfortable and affordable, a good way to get better sleep. We bought it for our extra bedroom."
3,Expectation was too high,"I wanted a matress that was firm, but it ended being too firm.I purchased this item to help alleviate that, and for a few weeks, it was heaven.But now it's like I'm sinking in the middle of my queen - just like I did with my old matress.I'm thinking this product needs to be turned and 'fluffed' like a pillow to keep it working. Because it DID work...I WOULD recommend it, but keep in mind that it's just a piece of foam. I think it needs room to breath once in a while - turned over, shaken, etc...As for the smell..LOL...most of the other reviewers were RIGHT. Peee-Ewww. Yuck.Be SURE and let 'ole Nellie air out before ya put her on your bed, darlin'!My last thought is that this purchase was NOT a waste of money. When it has run it's course, I will cut it in half and use it for camping. And/or a great 'padding' underneath the matress of the futon in the guest room."
4,Meets my expectation,"This product meets my expectation. It provides the extra cusion I needed. It does have some strong chemical smell when you open the package and it also appears to be out of shape initially. After laying it flat for a few days, the odder was reduced significantly and the shape was back to normal. I topped it with a mattress pad and cover sheet. Now I can hardly notice the smell. Maybe I got used to it too.Tip: Don't expose it under the sun. I had purchased another pad before (not from the same maker) and placed it outdoor to get rid of the smell. Although no damage was done, it got discolored badly.I ordered a TWIN Extra Long and it fits perfectly for the king size bed (length-wise) on my side of the bed.This is a product I will recommend."
3,Sleep Better Memory Foam,"For not being able to buy a new mattress, the price of the memory foam pad was great. my husband and i are sleeping better and my back aches are fading."
5,Worth Every Penny!,This memory foam is awesome!!! Our bed feels like a fluffy cloud. My only complaint is that my king size sheets just barely fit the bed now. I'm going to have to upgrade to California king sheets. But that's no big deal. I love this product!!!
5,"Very comfortable, but it does smell","It took about a week to fully expand and we really had our doubts that it ever would, but it did. It didn't fully get to the size they said it would. I did get the Cal King for our queen sized bed, so it worked out fine. It was easy to cut to fit. Definitely worth the extra $7.00 for that size. It would not look right if it weren't big enough and didn't fit the whole top of the mattress. It does have a smell to it. We put it outside twice to air it out, but it is winter around here in NY. Our son in Las Vegas bought one, aired it out for about a week and it is fine. It doesn't smell. I will do the same when it warms up here. It really is comfortable and was a great price. Knowing what I now know about it, I would buy it again. But you HAVE to air it out."
4,Our new 2-inch mattress topper,"We put the mattress topper on our bed in our 5th wheel rv.It made a big difference.The bed is much more comfortable.We both sleep better than before.Not much of a smell to topper,was gone totally in acouple of days."
4,Sleep better,"I bought the full size version first (for my oldest in college) and then HAD to buy the twin (youngest at home). Both versions are very very nice. They have a pleasant new scent as everything coming into your home would. We use flannel sheets and do not smell anything. As far as expanding, they took 24 hrs and fit on mattress very well. We were thinking of getting a new mattress for the twin, but this was a better price and a great fix. Now both daughters are getting a good night sleep, well worth the small investment."
5,Dreamy!!,I have tried foam mattress pads before with poor results. This baby is awesome. Very comfortable yet supportive. I use in my travel trailer and it is a big upgrade on the top of the padded mattress provided in the unit. Definitely recommend.
1,I Really Wished It Worked for Me :(,After reading all of the reviews I felt certain that I had finally found some relief for my bad back. I have degenerative disc disease in my L4-L5 and some nights it is hard to get comfortable for a good night's rest. The product came as described but I guess it was too soft and it made sleeping more painful. I'm sure it works for many others and I was praying that it would work for me but on the 3rd night I couldn't take it anymore- I had to get up and take it off my mattress.
1,Horrible SMELL!,"I don't know why the others have raved about this topper. Whatever comfort you feel from the ""memory"" of the foam is quickly overpowered by the indescribable smell that can only be unhealthy.If you are concerned about your health and the safety of your family, might try asking first or inquiring about the smell of the mattress. I've had it for a day so I don't know if a little airing should do the trick. However, I've sprayed it with Lysol and the horrible smell is still there. Smells like formaldehyde or some sharpie pen. Very , very bad."
4,2 inches of pure comfort,"The Sleep Better 2-Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper, (Queen) has enhanced the comfort of the mattress, reduced the disturbance when one person changes position, and has helped with the usual aches after a nights sleep.The packaging was removed 3 days before the Topper was used but a slight (chemical) smell persisted.Very pleased with the end result."
5,Like it alot,"Had a Down Feather Bed that was always shifting . Just got this Monday, comfy, soft, no smell. Need a new mattress soon hoping this will buy me a year. Cant beat the price!"
1,"Do not get this, Extremely unsatified","Received the package in quite a trash looking box.My parents actually called me to ask if I had gotten a junk foam for one of my engineering projects.the foam was dis-colored and looked beaten up. we tried to put it under the bed sheet and it felt nothing more than a standard mattress, well, maybe a little bit too soft.Till today the foam is still collecting dust in my garage since I feel sorry throwing away a over $100 purchase. ""Used one night and my parents would rather sleep on the origional bed"".Totally not worth the money."
4,almost perfect,the dvd's were awesome. everything worked fine except a few discs would skip or stall. and that only happened a fe times for a couple of seconds. besides that the dvd's work great.
3,i didnt get the whole set,"I just got one of the towels and when i contacted amazon they said description was infact wrong..they are actually selling just 1 when the add says 2.As nice as they are they did volunteer to refund and take it back including the shipping..but i fell in love with the towel meanwhile.. gave it 3 stars as the towels great!!!!!!If i had gotten the other one i wud giveit 5 stars.Update,I as sent another bath towel instead of a hand towel,very nice gesture by amazon...but i did want a hand towel so i could carry it along with me to my workouts etc. Anyways, Now i got 2 bath towels instead of one.Thankyou Amazon."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I'm not an expert on towels, but I do know that if you wash black towels, by themselves twice, and have not only fuzzies but also lint all over then somethings wrong."
2,Decent Towels,"Had one Martex towel rip and tear under light use, but the others have held up well after many wash cycles."
5,Oh mon dieu...Alizée...,"All I have to say is, I hope that more female French speaking/singing artists come out as beautiful and talented as Alizée. I just found a video from a live performance of hers, and I was literally blown away. Although I have no clue what she's singing about, the song was ""J'En Ai Marre!"" and it was catchy enough to get hooked on."
5,Endearing Romance,I was captured only after reading the first page of Chapter 1. Five hours later I had finished the book and left totally flabbergasted. I felt as if I personally knew every character. I am certain that almost every reader will in some form be able to relate to the characters and/or their life experiences. It was just too real!
3,Mixed Review,"The good: the color (I use light sand) blends well and looks natural, the sunscreen is very effective, gives the skin some radiance and even tone.The bad: unless you are one of the lucky people with polished skin and small pores, this product seems to emphasize all my facial flaws like large pores and a dry patch or two.I'm 45 yrs, with normal to oily skin, use to using the Bare Minerals."
1,Quality Control Problem,"I was shocked to find the front strap bracket broken. Apart from that, the vacuum cleaner is great but this q.c. problem is a show stopper."
5,Works well,"I got my first Bayer lancet device when I was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago, and I'm still using it. It is small and handy and fits in my kit and in my hand nicely. I haven't always been especially careful with it and it has held up fine. I use Bayer microlet colored lancets, and yes, they do hurt a little bit, but work best if my fingers are warm and clean. I can't imagine anything not hurting at all. I've found replacement Bayer lancet devices to be expensive so this price with free shipping (and $25 order) is pretty reasonable. I'd like to buy two more to go with my extra meters. My insurance won't pay for a Bayer meter or strips so I have to use a different brand meter, but my insurance will pay for the Bayer lancet device and lancets. I think I had to ask my doctor to prescribe it."
3,Bayer Microlet,"This device lances the finger producing a small droplet of blood for the standard diabetic glucose test. It holds the lance and allows for depth adjustment, is spring loaded, and actuated with a large button to initiate the lancing action. It works and the function is simple."
3,Lance device,i got this for my father in law. he needs a deep needle penetration to draw blood as fingers have been caloused from 50 years of diabetes. this didnt work for his case. probably will for others. i had to modify the depth by putting a paper spacer in the slot before the lance. then it worked fine.
4,enjoy this,Nice voice and a good performer I could listen to this for hours. Recommended for any one that likes classic music.
2,Awake & Disappointed,"I own three other Josh Groban CD's- Closer, Josh Groban in concert, & the 2001 CD simply titled Josh Groban. Closer I like, the other two I adore.So, I was happy to see this CD under the tree. I am honestly disappointed in it, I feel the material wasn't very good and the feeling or emotion, that have been in his previous CD's just isn't there. This just isn't one of his best!"
3,Not what I expected,"While this CD is okay, until I got to ""Machine"" with Herbie Hancock did I really see this guy's talent and feel like finally a song that moves. Before that it was tear-jerker music to me. I think if you like this guy, you have to listen to Gino Vanelli, who makes Josh sound like Mickey Mouse. If you like the English/Foreign tracks, then you must listen to Cato by Vannelli. It will give you chills. I've seen Gino 7 times in concerts starting in 1977, and there's nothing like him. It's a shame the US market never realized this talent.Josh is good, but he's still young and doesn't have the depth in his voice yet.Just my opinion, obviously I'm biased."
3,A Step Down,"I bought this CD the day it came out, having high expectations placed by his past work. However, my expectations were not met. I prefer the beautiful ballads full of passion (where's the ""To Where You Are"", ""When You Say You Love Me"", ""You're Still You"", etc?) There are only a few songs on ""Awake"" that I enjoy.""February Song"" is the type of music I love to hear from Josh. This song is fantastic and my favorite on the CD."
4,"Nice Album, But Different","OK, let's cut to the chase: You probably won't hate this album. Then again, if you're looking for a repeat of his two MASSIVE hit albums, this isn't it.The music is very pleasant, even romantic at times, and Groban is maturing as an artist while continuing to entertain and charm the ardent.But there isn't a great, important piece like you found in the first two albums, either. Don't get me wrong - I like the album, and I think it's very unfair to expect every artist to hit a one-pitch grand slam with every release. If you never heard him before, you'll be impressed by his power and talent. The die-hard Grobanites are either going to love it ""just because"" or hate it because its not what they are used to.Me? I like it, I play it and I would buy it again. It's just that it's not an automatic like the first two."
5,"Josh Groban, What a voice.","Once again fantastic. His voice is amazing,I could listen to this cd 24/7. I don`t think you could go wrong with any of his music, he just keeps getting better and better and to think he`s really only just begun."
3,Timeless quality,It's wasn't quite what I was expecting nonetheless I enjoyed the purity of his voice. His voice is truly amazing.
3,"Not a charmer, Josh's Voice Going Strained?","I adore Josh Groban's first 2 cds, but this last one just lacks...pizzaz. And through most of the songs Josh actually sounds more asleep than awake. His voice also sounds like it is straining at times, something that never happened on Josh Groban or Closer. His adroids (muscles in the nose) (may be spelled wrong) sound swollen, causing the nasaly sound heard in many of the songs.Concerning the writing, Febuary Song and You Are Loved are the definite kickers, the rest (particularly the Italian ones) sound like normal songs: Girl left guy, guy complaining about it. Or guy sees girl, guy wants girl.He's trying out new things, which I respect, but needs to switch to a new vocal coach."
4,A Time For Us,"My favorite track is a revised oldie, Track 10 ""Un Giorno Per Noi,"" which is ""A Time For Us"" from ""Romeo & Juliet."" I wonder who will be skating to this one. Maybe all of them.If you'd like to hear this song in English, check out tenor Marius Evangelista on the Web and on ITunes."
5,Josh Groban,Josh is my favorite! I love the new CD. It is in my Ipod and I listen to him and many others daily on my walks. Keep up the great work. What a voice!!!
2,Asleep,"Hyperbole is a fool's tool, but I am dumbstruck at the hosannas bestowed upon this latest release from this pseudo-classical popera artist. I'm sure he's a nice enough boy, but as he jettisons toward each next high note, it signifies nothing, really. Granted, this new discharge is a leap ahead of his previous turgidly droning releases - I'd wish he'd forgo his awkward use of a multilingual erudition altogether - but he and his ilk remain a philter for the wishful thinking, and a gallimaufry of cliché's for the rest of us. Perfect voice for a Christmas Collection, though. My grade: B-"
5,Just great,"This is by far the best album of Josh Groban; the Spanish songs are so beautiful, even if you don't understand Spanish I can assure you will feel the love!!!I can listen to his music all day long."
4,"Josh Groban, at last!","It was a long wait, but I was happy to hear all the new songs by Josh Groban. Anxiously awaiting the next CD!"
3,Not sure about this one,I am a huge fan of Josh Groban but was disappointed in this CD. I expected more of his great musicical style and was disappointed in some of his newer material.
3,Not What I expected,"This CD is an eclectic mixture of songs from lyrical melodies to more contemporary songs writen by Josh. I'm sure Groban wanted to get away from the tried and true semi-classical lyrical songs that he is famous for. However, I wanted more of the tried and true. The three Spanish numbers were melodic and wonderful. The two with Ladyblacksmith Mambazo were great as well. The more modern songs had many minor chords, and had no resolution and not much melody. I frankly felt that they were boring and uninspiring. That comprised more than half of the 12 songs"
3,it is worth $10 but playlist doesn't work,"I called customer support 3 times. They are friendly and polite, best of all they are native English speakers. Unfortunately since this is an old product they are not familiar with it. The consensus was although the manual says it supports playlists, it really doesn't. I tried for hours & couldn't make it work.The random play isn't very random.FM receiver is OK, I didn't try presets.The sound is good. Earplugs are adequate, a little big for my ears but they didn't fall out.If you just want to play songs a few hours a week this is great. That is all I wanted."
4,Pimpin Ain't Easy But It Sure Is Necessary,Sugar Valentine was a good movie that needed to tell the story and little bit more. It left you wondering what happened in between because it is a true story.Sugar was a broke pimp that was trying to get his game back and in the meantime he fell in love with an undercover cop that took the little bit of his pimp game away.
1,save your money,this film is a cinematic atrocity dont waste your money. sure there is lots of violence but the violence is pointless and dull. the director claims that its a throwback to the 70's and its not it fails miserably. its sad that all the controversy will bring people to watch this film looking for something and unfortunatly they wont find anything. this film has barely any redeeming qualities. many people may find this film shocking and thats unfortunate because the director uses mostly cheap scares to shock his audience and usues very little style. bottom line this movie sucks.
2,A would be cult classic hacked to pieces,I've read all the user reviews and it would really be nice if they would point out which version they watched cause it sure as hell was'nt the R version.I can't feel but shear disapointment after watching this version of the film.because it becomes quickly apparent that it was literally hacked to pieces.leaving what I assume is just enough to qualify as a movie.I would almost bet that you'll see more disturbing images and subject matter in saw 3 then this.so hey dont worry watch on cause there's nothing controversial left in the R version unless your easily offended by subject matter or shots of the burning trade towers.cause as far as explicit violence goes it's not here.
4,So Far So Good!,"Installed the two new batteries in my two Katana phones, and charged them up. They are working up to specs, no problemo. I don't usually buy from small companies I don't know, but I trust Amazon Marketplace and they haven't let me down yet!"
5,Great Fall jewelry,"This necklace is great - a little darker than the photo online. It's a perfect fall/autumn necklace. Good quality, great packaging, and it comes directly from Amazon, no 3rd party dealers."
1,Not something you would use as a CD PLAYER,This compontent sounds like something I got as a child and thought it was cool at that time. In the 60's... but I can go to any store here in Portland Oregon and buy something cheaper and sounds ALOT better for cheaper.... Sorry Amazon... But I will still buy from you cause you are a GREAT COMPANY... BUT NOT THIS ITEM...OK...Holly
4,Worth its Money,The boom box is worth its money. I really enjoy this.Could have been much better if it comes with a remote and aline out pin for connecting it to subwoofer systems.
5,Good Album,"This album contains a lot of my favorite Less Than Jake songs, Gainesville Rock city, Look What Happened, Magnetic North, among others. Overall it has a great sound. The horns are awesome, there is some really cool guitar, and vocals/lyrics are great. This album is most definitely worth the money, it will keep you dancing for years."
3,"Very Good, But","Borders and Boundaries is a very good album, but it is not typical Less Than Jake. The album is slower than the others, and not as upbeat. If you're like me, and have liked Less Than Jake for a long time, you probably won't like this album as much (but I'd buy it anyway)."
4,Funny internal dialogue,"For the most part I enjoyed this book. The author has a very good sense of humor with most of it done as internal dialogue which reminded me of Jennifer Crusie. However, I would have liked to have seen more dialogue which I think would have moved the story a little faster. All in all, a good read."
1,Worthless,this product has done nothing. I have taken it as sugested the rining is as bad as it was when i started.Glenn
1,so far....nothing,"so far.....few weeks after and NO impruvment!I took the pills and did not see any results, I still have ringing in my ear...."
1,Unfortunately didn't work for me,"Went through several bottles with no noticeable result, but I know there is no magic bullet for tinnitus so the search continues...I mistakenly made two separate orders, one for this and one for Lipo-Flavonoid Plus Dietary Supplement, For Ear Health* 100 ea and immediately asked them to cancel this order to no avail. Completely ignored. I could have disputed it but it wasn't worth it. Passing the rest on to a friend to see if it will work for him. Just beware customer service is not sparkling."
3,Jury is still out,"I may have some improvement, but I'm not sure yet. The noise seems to be lessening. I have only been taking for a couple of weeks."
1,lipo-flavonoid,This product had no benefit at all. Do not waste your money. I purchased this product about two months ago and I have taken roughly 200 pills.
2,Does Not Work At All!,I bought two 500 tablet containers and I am just about finished with the second one. I have been taking 4 tablets a day for the last eight months and there is no difference in my hearing. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It just does not work.
1,Unfortunately didn't work for me,"Went through several bottles with no noticeable result, but I know there is no magic bullet for tinnitus so the search continues...I mistakenly made two separate orders, one for this and one forLIPOFLAVONOID PLUS CAPLETSand immediately asked them to cancel the other to no avail. Completely ignored. I could have disputed it but it wasn't worth it. Passing the rest on to a friend to see if it will work for him. Just beware customer service is not sparkling."
3,Supplement for Tinnitis,"The studies I read reported that the product needs to be taken for four months before noticeable relief is experienced, and that it doesn't work for everybody. I have been taking the product for about one and a half months and have the feeling that I am experiencing somewhat reduced ringing. That may be placebo effect but I have hope. Check back later."
2,Lipoflavonoid caplets - 500 ea,I was disappointed that it didn't take care of the ringing in MY ears. It was recommended to me by ear doctor.
2,Don't work,While this product may be good for some it did not work for me. I have noticed no difference since taking this product.
1,Lipoflavonoid Plus,I tried this product for two months and had no results at all. I was taking other suppliments and thought this one could be the answer to my knee problem. I wouldn't recommend this product to any one else.
2,Did not help me,"I used at least 2 bottles of this stuff and it did not help me. But my ringing is not real bad, perhaps if it was real bad it would improve it."
2,Nope,"Went through 600 caps with zero improvement. However, the company honored their money-back policy. Good to do business with a firm like this. We need more of them!"
3,Vitamin,Although this product didnt work for me it might for others. I still notice the ringing in my ears after taking this vitamin.
3,Cute Bubble-Gum Read,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer. This book addressed many issues without going deep into any. The concerns addressed were ones that many people face in today's life, such as domestic abuse, the care of an elderly parent and fear of commitment, but we never learned the reasons why these characters suffered from these issues. The book was a nice light read, but the lack of character development was a complete turnoff for me. It's a great beach book. Not too deep, and not something you are committed to."
4,"Fun muscle workout, not going to get that heartrate up though.",Both DVDs are fun. The Hula Cardio doesn't really get your heartrate up much but both work abs & buns well plus they're fun workouts.
3,Wrong Language,I've got to say the first fifteen minutes made me a little unconformable because I wasn't expecting certain types of scenes. It wasn't porno or anything of the sort. It just felt weird. The other disappointment was I thought this was a movie in Urdu and turned out to be Punjabi. I never finished watching it. Maybe some day I'll watch it all.
5,Lives Up to the Hype,Wow!What a spectacular CD ... the sound quality and the feel from the CD are simply amazing - the ultimate headphone experience blew me away.Cannot wait to see what Zenph produces next!
1,A novelty at best,"This is like listening to a modern pianist trying to imitate Gould, yet falling way short. The ""Zenph"" lacks Gould's touch, unique phrasing, nuance, dynamics... and the piano used sounds nothing like anything Gould would employ (and he was VERY picky about the sound of his piano). This recording is a novelty; nothing more."
2,DISCOURAGING,"I do not presume of being a Bach, Gould, or even a general music expert. I just happen to love music in general, and don't have any special or academic qualification, but let me tell you this. I just downloaded the original version and the Zenph reperformance from iTunes. They are *really* different. Many people --many of whom have given less than three stars to this experiment-- have conceded that ""all the notes are there"". But all I can say is: the two versions are as similar as a Gould vs a very talented and obsessive Gould's fan. Even I, who had never listened to any of the versions, could feel the difference. I think the label ""re-performance"" should not be used; only monetary compensation could have prevented Gould's heirs to sue this company for taking GG's name for its experiment. Had they been fair, they should have labeled this ""in the manner of..."", or something similar. NOBODY could take this for the original Glenn."
2,Deeply disappointing,"Being a pianist myself, and finding the original 1955 Gould recording a perennial inspiration, I was really looking forward to this new issue. A) the SACD format; B) the new technology of re-performance; and C) the idea of having the static cut out - all attracted me quite a bit. But the actual quality of the product was, from a musician's point of view, poor. None of Gould's energy comes through in the recording. The sound of the piano is also very electronic and does not give a good musical sense. It may be technically true to the strokes that Gould's fingers made on the piano, but musically it simply falls short. I am reselling the SACD and going to clean my original LP for much better musical enjoyment."
5,Suspense-filled horror,"Really enjoyed this author's latest book. Had to stay up late at night to finish it - couldn't put it down! The author has a great ability to make you really care about the characters she writes about. An easy-reading book; not too short or too long, but leaves you wanting for more!"
3,If at first you don't succeed ...,"I've come to the conclusion that, though this pot is decent quality and well made, the size makes it unweildy.Every time I think I've mastered (tamed) it, I lose a pot of pasta in the sink at the last second. Because of the size of the pot, the need to keep a firm grip on the handles, and the twisting position you need to take to drain the contents, this is a tricky operation. This sounds silly. How could draining a pot be tricky ... but, with this pot and cover... well, it is.Will probably give it a couple more tries before I give up ... and drain over a strainer - just in case!"
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"All but one of the times I've used this pot, the handles did NOT hold the lid tightly enough while straining to prevent my freshly cooked/steamed food from ending up in the sink. It's all fine and good that the non-stick surface is as promised, but the whole reason I bought this product was for the straining feature. The price would have been fantastic if the product worked. Instead, it's just money down the sink--slong with my pasta and vegetables!!!"
5,"Excellent Book. Good follow up to ""Voyage of the Devilfish"".",If you like Tom Clancy you'll love Dimercurio
5,sunshine,"these are the best protein bars ive ever had! they taste great, not too sweet and not artificial tasting at all. The size are pretty big, so you could eat half, and you dont go through them as quickly."
2,Another protein bar that taste like cardboard.,It's not tasty. Not sweet. It's dry and taste like powder protein. I will not be purchasing this brand anymore.
5,Balance and nutrition,I use this product after a good daily run keeps my mind and body balance until next big meal and would recommend it.
3,Way too sweet,"These bars aren't bad, but they have too much artificial sweetener and an unpleasant aftertaste. Whey Protein is nice, but I prefer Clif Builders bars for the taste."
1,"Sour Grapes, Lonely Inner Child, Dreamer in Black and White","Let me begin by saying that in Spring, 2000, Scientists, thru an MRI of a fossilized dinosaur, JUST found out that they had four chamber hearts and were WARM blooded creatures, not the cold-blood things they new as an absolute scientific FACT in January 2000. My, my. What a difference a few months makes. One day, our ""science and technology"" will become advanced enough to record/measure, weigh and repeat excursions into the 90% of the human brain we know nothing about. They will begin to be able to interpret the visible light scale beyond the puny ultraviolet and ultra sound barriers our mostly dormant conscious human brain can today interpret. Science will see and hear ET's and possibly learn our true origin from them. Then characters like this author will be standing alone with egg on their faces and skulking off to a dark room to play their favorite dress up game, ""The Spanish Inquisition."""
4,Comfortable and Small,"These headphones are a nice choice. They're comfortable and tiny. They fit perfectly inside the ear and the sound is pretty nice. Howver, if you're into listening to the volume turned up all the way, then these headphones just aren't for you. The sound starts to go when you turn them up all the way. The look of the headphones is nice though and the price isn't a punch in the stomach."
1,Bwaah haa ha ha ha ha,"Ha ha, bwah ha ha ha ah ah, ha... Oh god, look at the little suit its wearing, oh no, oh god ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... ha ha ha, gwerf, nerk, ha, hoo, ha, oh lord... ha ha ha ha ha ha..."
1,Not even fit for a cup stand...,"This album is terrible. And, NO! I am not just saying that because he's just a lame poser, this is really a terrible album. Ice Ice Baby does not have a cathcy beat.. And nor does the whole album. His vocals are squeaky and just sound lame. I tried to make some use of it.. No I really did! I tried using it as a cup stand but i realized i would poison my drink! This album is so lame I couldn't even run over it! (it would've touched my car) So I realized that in hell nothing survives... so on Christmas day I burned it in my fire. More seriously though. This albums beats are annoying, and the rhymes are lame. Do NOT waste money on it. I suggest 2pac Jedi Mind Tricks, or if you have to have a white rapper the Beastie Boys, or The Fun Lovin' Criminals"
1,"worst ""rapper"" ever",I remember when this cd first came out. I hated it then and I hate it now. I was listening to NWA back then and that's way better than anything Vanilla Ice could ever do. Vanilla Ice has always been the worst rapper alive and always will be. No one should be worse than him.
3,It's ok,"It fits very good, but I wish it had been made in a softer material. It is big to storage under the stroller."
5,The best Pumkin Song Ever,"Heard this song for the first time watchin the Pumpkin movie and I just had to have it. This song rocks. If anyone knows who plays trumpet on the pumpkin song please email me, thanks!"
3,Charming,Charming little book that ranks #2 out of the 3 I recently purchased. Not particularly cerebral but not as insulting as other titles were - i.e - it assumes that teachers do have some brains!. Not nearly as in depth as I would have liked but offers up some helpful phraseology.
5,Fantastic book,"I'm not normally a fan of short stories, but I decided that I couldn't pass up a book edited by one of my favorite writers, Elizabeth George. And I'm certainly glad that I gave this book a chance! It is filled with deliciously chilling stories that will haunt you long after you finish them."
1,Disappointing.,"SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES (1961) is a VERY disappointing Three Stooges feature. This is more of a drama than a comedy. About the only funny part is when the Stooges throw four measly pies at the guard in the kitchen. One reason this is bad is because here, the Stooges are working for 20th Century Fox instead of Columbia. Believe me, this could be a lot better.Grade: D"
3,DVD: WIDESCREEN Cinemascope presentation in COLOR!,"O.K. the movie is not the greatest Stooges film, but as a childrens film it is entertaining.The BIG news here is that this DVD will be the first WIDESCREEN CINEMASCOPE presentation of this movie since its original theatrical release! For decades Stooges fans have only seen the cropped/pan & scan square picture on their TVs.This two-sided DVD offers both the theatrical Cinemascope version, and the cropped/pan & scan TV version. Its design encourages you to view the full screen/pan & scan version, you must put the side with the green ring around the center facing downward to view the original theatrical wide screen Cinemascope version.The occasional fan will want to pass on this for the Curly classics. But the true serious fan will want this one!"
5,# 1 gift for single or married women,"I work at a store where they sell this, and It's the best gift. Every women I have shown it too, LOVES it. A must have! It's hilarious!!"
2,I Really Hate to Say This,"I really hate to say this, but this is just a stinker of a movie. The script is awful. The production quality is B-movie level. And most of the acting is bad. The film's message is great, but, oh my goodness, that message is so horribly packaged that many people will turn off the movie without finishing it. The movie drags horribly at times. At one point there's an obvious film glitch where you see where a splice was done. I just hate to say this about this movie because I was really looking forward to it, but it's just very poorly done."
2,Losing Time,"If you hated irony is a dead scene, you will hate this.Why does this guy think he can sing like mike patton? what is it about his voice that makes me scratch my head in disgust? if dillinger wanted to do something new, thats great, but thats no reason to have a total lapse in judgement and taste. what happened to the dillinger that was so good and frightening it was funny? it was a caricature of chaos. This album is in NO way more ''groundbreaking'' than Calculating-listen to that album, then listen to this miss machine and scratch your head in disbelief. now they are just some wimpy math rock band with terrible vocals and terrible lyrics. my little sister would like this cd."
3,"Survey of the New Testament, A (4th Edition)","I have no comment concerning this book, because I had to order it to use for a course I am taking."
1,"Never received item, requesting Full Refund!","Amazon Staff:This product never made it to my home. My account was debited for $33.98 for the purchase of a product I never received. In e-mailing the seller, 501646, she claims to never have received a purchase request nor the money for the book A Survey of the New Testament. She also claims that this book is not listed in her inventory. I am not sure what the mix up was with Amazon and her, but my account was debited and I NEVER received the item. I am requesting a full refund for the purchase I made. I was forced to purchase the same book from another seller two weeks after my purchase with 501646. I have been a customer of Amazon since 2003, under a different name, but I have relied on them for my college textbooks. I would greatly appreciate if this situation did not hinder my future purchases from Amazon. Thank you in advance for your cooperation and taking the time to evalute my claim.Kind Regards,Mrs. Delshamira Francis"
4,Super,This book is perfect stepping stone for someone entering the fundraising field. Its short and very easy to read. If you know alot about fundraising this book would probably just re-enforce what you already know but if your just starting out this is the best book you can read!
4,very good,The book is very good and easy to follow. It has an audio CD that make it better.Very good for beginners like me.
3,Not the Showtime music,"I love, love, love the Reefer Madness movie on Showtime. I guess I didn't look very closely at the songs on this, the original musical CD. I thought they would have the same songs, but, nope. ""Listen to Jesus Jimmy"" is still the best song, but others like ""Loved by Mary Lane"" are missing.This is a fun CD but unless you saw and liked the original musical, it may not be what you are looking for."
5,A huge departure,"Oddly enough I just happened across this album in the store 2 days after it came out, not being aware that the gods of rock had called upon Propagandhi to blow my mind again. I popped it in and grimaced for the first 30 seconds.... then my head promptly exploded.What you get here is unique. It's kind of a hardcore album... but it's not like anything I've ever heard, it's alot better. The guitar work is scary, I did not know Chris' hands could do that. Back to the Motor League and Purina Hall of Fame sport some rather impressive solos at the end. And Jord has fills to pay the bills.The ECD feature on the disk is nice, for fans of the band. It has a few short movies about various political topics, including COINTELPRO.They've honed thier political message perfection, and in the process practically invented a new genre of music.The best album I have bought since the Supreme Court decided that American votes don't matter, thats for sure."
5,Excellent,"This album is amazing, I enjoy it extremely. Chris hannah's singing is outstanding, and todd is a grizzly bear, but obviosly he makes the band complete. Jord plays drums how they should be played. Each song is different from one another. The best song any band ever created is probably Purina Hall of Fame, or A speculative fiction (From potemkin city limits)The most important tracks to listen to are Mate Ka, Albright Monument, New home for idle hands, With Friends Like These, and Purina Hall Of Fame.But the albums in order, and the newest one last, that one is a surprise."
3,Don't think this is the pinnacle of political punk,"I don't know what that guy was thinking calling NOFX ""political"". Anyway, Propagandhi is just the tip of the iceberg for radical punk/hardcore music. In my opinion, they're a little too ""Fat Wreck Chord-ized"". Before you go leaping to such praise, please check out the bands that made groups like Propagandhi, Good Riddance, and other such new jack radical political bands want to get together in the first place. Here's a quick remedial list: Born Against, Refused, Born Against,Econochrist, Born Against, Nation of Ulysses,and Born Against. And that's just in the mid-nineties hard(post)core vein. Then you've got Conflict, Flux, Icons of Filth, Discharge, the Subhumans, Zounds, etc. etc. etc. So do your homework, kiddies. P.S.- Guess what band Propagandhi completely [based themselves on] in the early days so they could establish themselves... Born Against!"
2,it could have been better,"the acting.. well it wasnt great, but it was better than many other filipino movies. the soundtrack, however, was really good. but anyway. so rather than going to medical school, ben, the main character, wants to go to cal arts. his father, on the other hand, does not support him in his choice for a career.. blah blah blah.. basically, the movie just puts all of the stereotypes together in a rather mediocre, and yet again, stereotypical storyline, because in the end, everyone changes. the barrel men, the food, the parties, the small house with 09287354821728743 always there, the big spoon and fork, the AzN pRyDeRs, the difference between the word ""oriental"" and ""asian"", the filipina with the american husband, someone making a racist comment (eating dog), etc etc. basically, had the storyline been better--less stereotypes with more focus on what the actualy purpose of the movie was, then it may have been decent."
4,Not only for Filipinos,"This is a must see for everyone to see and understand Filipino culture. Every Filipino kid should see this movie. In addition, I believe that everyone should see this movie even if you are not Filipino. It exposes a lot of the culture that foreigners do not understand about Filipino culture."
3,Does the job.,It was easy to install and I have no problems with leaking but the lever to turn the spray on is very hard to push. I bought from Amazon because of free shipping.
1,Where's the mounting hardware?,Anyone interested in this spray head be aware it does not include any mounting hardware and without it makes this virtually useless.
3,Color is off,"I tried this, but when I recieved it the color seemed to be more pink than purple. It sure wasn't the darker purple that I saw on my screen...and wanted, so I returned it. As a paper it's fine...but just wasn't the color I needed."
4,The third U.K. single off The Sophtware Slump.,"Track 1 is the glorious 9 minute-long, three-movement album version. Track 2, Wives of Farmers, is a must-have for serious collectors. Track 3, N. Blender, is mostly instrumental but is a fun anomaly. Packaging is a pretty mess of photos, drawings, typewriter fonts and infinite light blue. According to the liner notes, songs were recorded ""at frantic corporate deadline conveyor belt studios, Armpit, California."" A nod to Modesto? You decide."
4,a great doll bed,"This doll bed is a great size, attractive, and I guess well-made, since my 2 year old grandaughter sits on it with her dolls and stuffed animals, at times has even lain down in it (legs hanging over the bottom railing). I would like the fabrics of the blanket and pillow to be of better quality, though they are not shabby."
2,Too self-aggrandizing and too angry,"Petersen's memoir of his life in the woods is one of those books I got halfway through, hoping it would improve, eventually tossing it away in disappointment.There is a weird persistent undertone of seething bitterness toward ""civilization"" here, which Petersen can't ever quite shake. Also, it's impossible to ignore the hypocrisy in trash talking technology and society, while at the same time availing onseself of chain saws and pickup trucks, as Petersen often does when it is convenient.I am a nature fanatic and love a good nature book. But unless you are looking for a tiresome self-righteous rant about the ills of society, clothed in a ""look at how great my life is here in the woods"" lecture, there are many many other great books about self-sufficient living you can enjoy."
2,Insufferably preachy,"To those who enjoy listening to argumentative, judgmental enviro-preachers, this is your book. If you have lights and running water in your house, not so much. Not everyone can live the author's lifestyle and he judges you harshly for it. I made it halfway and couldn't take any more. Mind you, I side with him on many of his issues, but couldn't get past his vitriol. Opinion is fact to this writer, his lifestyle is the only lifestyle worth living. If you want to clobbered over the head by a guy you might otherwise have agreed with, go for it."
2,Full of errors and misprints,This is the first volume of a ocean engineering series. It's a small book that promises a lot but delivers very little. The seakeeping part is old-fashioned and almost useless ( see the next volume of the series - from BHATTACHARYA ). The book is full of typos and errors of all kinds. Even second hand it's expensive considering what it offers to the reader. I can't understand why it's still around.
4,Internet Radio,"Internet Radio offers information on access to thousands of radio stations, world-wide and in almost every cultural category. Radio listeners who suffer from weak reception of local stations or do not share the taste or politics of local broadcasters will find a treasure of choices.The author's politically-correct and lefist politics are evident in his diatribe against ""Right-Wing"" radio stations (p.269) and in other sermons dispersed in his text. Some stations may not have been listed for those listeners.However, readers will discover a vast choice of radio stations, delivering music, talk, drama, analysis and windows on cultures the world. Methods for connection and ratings of broadcasts abound.Recommended."
3,Life After Love,"First I must confess my bias for writer-performers. It takes a multi-talented team to pen both lyrics and music, in addition sing and play instruments. On ""Heartbeats Accelerating."" Kate and Anna wrote 7 of the 10 songs, provide lead and harmony vocals, and contribute accordion, keyboard and guitar work.""Heartbeats Accelerating"" is a deceptive title - the framework of this CD is loneliness. ""I Eat Dinner"" finds mother and daughter alone at the dinner table, ""Mother Mother"" is a haunting image of protectionism and fear, and loneliness and death are united in ""St. Johns Hospital. Perhaps the McGarrigles should have concluded the CD on a more optimistic note with the hopeful anticipation of ""Heartbeats Accelerating."" Guaranteed that you will not be prepared for ""Leave Me Alone"" - no matter how many times I listen to this composition, it always leaves me tearful albeit blessed.You also may find a warm and comforting place in the mature and tender world of the McGarrigle sisters."
4,Cute Crib,"I bought this for my preschool daughter and she loves it. A variety of her ""babies"" fit in the crib and the blanket and pillow are adorable. I'm concerned that one of the side railings may split apart. As we were tighten the screw it start to crack. We did not over tighten the screw, as a portion of it is sticking out. As a result, I question the durability of this toy."
2,Disappointed,"We were not able to get 4 screws into one side of the crib. They do not catch on the bolts. Guess we will just glue it. Very disappointed. I thought a Melissa and Doug product would have better parts. It looks super cute otherwise, but it's pretty ridiculous that one side is not secured because the pieces do not work together."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"I have been purchasing Melissa & Doug products for my daughter for the past two years. The quality and the craftsmanship has always been excellent, up until now!The Crib had several cracks in numerous parts, several chips and debris that were just painted over.. Upon assembly, several screws & nuts were not the correct size. I sent an email to the Company today expressing my displeasure. In the future I will strongly reconsider purchasing this Company's products but as far as the crib is concerned DO NOT BUY IT!!!"
5,Great product!,"Great selection for the price! Was a huge hit at my karaoke party!Definitely recommend, it's a good purchase. Love it."
3,would be great,"Would be great, but a few of the songs do not play. If the quality was better it would be a 5."
4,Quite a Collection!,"I was pleasantly suprised at this multi-disc collection of Kareoke songs. It has Rock, Pop, Country, Showtunes, Standards, Hard Rock, Soft Rock, Jazz and more.There literally is something for everyone here. And although I am not into everything that is included...there is a majority of everything here that I do like.The CD's are good quality and except for missing a song-book or a lyric book or even asong listing....its a good collection. 3-27-09"
5,"Great deal, great fun!","I was a little worried when I ordered that the quality wouldn't be great for the price. I was pleasantly surprised!!!!! Great quality cds and plenty of song choices. I took it to a family party and we had singers from their 20s to their 60s! Some of the older people that never sang, sang several times and even stayed later than normal b/c they were having so much fun. It was a great party and this pack definitely added to it. I would highly recommend making this purchase!"
1,power pad,"I wouldnt recomend this controller to anyone. I paid thirty dollars for it about a year ago when the normal ones were 40 to save 10 dollars and im really kickin myself for it now. you have to push the buttons really hard and when you are in the middle of playing it says ""please reconnect the controller and press start"". that is the most annoying part. you are in the middle of a race or getting ready to shoot someone and you get a message that says press start."
5,"Good book, a little confusing at times.","I found this book a little confusing at times, but maybe its me. I still highly recommend it, it is a fresh new angle on Geometry."
1,Early Allman Brothers,"I disagree with Paul's review. Gregg's voice is the only good thing about this album. At least you can recognize it as his voice. The boys were forced into doing this album by Liberty Records. They totally stiffled Duane's playing & instead there's all kinds of horns & background singers that are just appalling. Might want it as a collectors item if you are a die hard AB fan...otherwise, give it a pass."
4,Great Service!,I was pleased in that the product arrived on time and in good shape. I really appreciate this service that Amazon and it's affiliates provide at an exceptionally reasonable cost.
1,Very poorly written,"I am an avid reader of all things auto, devouring books, magazines and internet articles... everything from Automotive Engineering, Auto News to Ed White's columns on the WSJ. I have read a number of good books (Ingrassia and White's account of the rise and fall of the US industry being one of them) but this one certainly comes nowhere near a good read.For a start, the author could begin with correct english usage. I am taking my GMAT soon and found the sentence construction appaling to say the least... I had to quickly drop reading this book for fear that I would unlearn all the rules of english!! The subject treatment did not help much either. The book did not engage me at all. It does not build a story, nor characters and uses cliched words repetitively.Best to borrow it from the library (as I did). That way, when I had to drop it after reading 30-40 pages, I didnt feel so bad."
2,Not what I expected,"Is David Magee a pen name for Carlos Ghosn? The book was way too subjective and one-sided. Or perhaps the State of Mississippi paid for the production of this book. And what is that book he quotes, 'Renaissance' by Carlos Ghosn? Could Mr. Magee at least tell us who the publisher is so that we can see what the man (Ghosn) himself has to say?"
5,An Album Which Can Literally Block The Sun,"Thoreau used the phrase ""quiet desperation"" to describe the way most men live their lives. Frank Sinatra gave voice to the pain and triumphs of so many people, especially during his artistic peak of the mid-to-late 1950s. ""In The Wee Small Hours"" captures songs that convey their pain with dignity and wisdom. It is almost unheard of that anyone could draw on nearly 50 years worth of classic standards, joining them with empathetic arrangements and stilletto sharp singing to create an album both sadder and wiser; a soft, elegant scream. That is ""In The Wee Small Hours,"" Frank Sinatra's best original album."
3,Great movie but blue-ray disc does not work - 3D BR works,Bought from Amazon but the blue-ray disc does not work on my Samsung BR Player. All other Blue-ray disc works fine and I have updated the FW to the latest version. Movie is great but disappointed with the BR disc. I will return back to Amazon.Update on RIO Blue Ray 3DRio (Four-Disc Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy)Just received it yesterday and the BR 3D works on our Samsung player. It was nice to see these animation on 3D on big screen TV. I am still disappointed that the BR disc does not work on my player.
5,great movie,my 3 year old loves this movie and did since he was two years old. Everything as expected in advertising.
4,very entertaining family film--beautiful to watch,"Most of whether or not someone enjoys this movie is going to be really subjective, so I'll stick to what I consider to be objective: the look of the animation. Put simply, this is a visually stunning film. If they were looking to showcase the possibilities of high-definition animation to dazzle the sense, they succeeded entirely. It has a neat, fairly charming, and even refreshingly (somewhat) original story that I should think any adolescent or younger child will love, and it's got enough ""ooh, shiny"" factor to keep my two-year old entranced."
1,Blu / PS3 issues,"I like this movie. It's no classic, but it keeps all of my four children entertained and it's not mind numbing. That said, I purchased the blu ray so that I could see the movie in its full HD glory. The blu copy skips horribly on my PS3. I read a review that stated that you could delete the BD Utility folder and fix the problem. I thought I was safe with this fix. Unfortunately, deleting said folder did not fix the problem. The kids enjoy the DVD, but the blu is just a coaster. That makes me feel angry, duped, and like I didn't get my money's worth."
5,Very Entertaining!,Rio is a very nice animated movie to add to your collection. In Blu-ray the animation looks beautiful and in 3D it is awesome! I highly recommend it. Shipping was a breeze through Amazon.
5,Great Movie,My kids enjoyed all enjoyed this movie - they range from 5 to 14! So we really like it when we find a movie they will watch and enjoy.
5,Kids give it 5 Stars!,"Rio is bright, colorful, lively, and full of music--exactly what one imagines when they think of Rio, Brazil, Carnival Capital of the World.Sure, some of the other (more critical) reviews you'll read on Amazon will gripe about forced themes and whatnot, but, really, all this movie comes down to is fun and finding love (for both the avian and human characters).Remember, folks, these animated movies, although certainly entertaining for (and meant to include) adults, are really targeted for children.My kids give it 5 Stars and can't wait to have their own copy. They loved all of the characters--even mean, old Nigel--as their personalities are just as colorful and varied as what is viewed on-screen.The animation is beautiful and the storyline understandable--a plausible explanation for how Blu got to Minnesota, why he's afraid to fly, and why he needs to go to Rio.A great movie for little and big people alike!"
4,Nice,"I bought this for my grandkids and the oldest one has a tablet and Dad is having a problem loading the digital copy ,,,, other than that I am very pleased with my purchase. Thank You!"
5,love it,My kids love the movie. Kids will enjoy the bright colors and funny! funny! The songs are very upbeat and fun
5,Great movie,"My family loves movie night and this is the perfect edition to our collection. This is such a wonderful movie for all ages. The product arrived early, the price was great, and the condtion was excellent! I would deffinitely reccomend this product to others of all ages."
4,Great Animation Movie,"Bought this movie for my wife, as we have seen it before, and she loves it. Great movie and the picture quality of the movie is great. The picture quality is usually great on animation movies anyways."
5,rio GREAT!,This is a wonderful movie. Great music and a great storyline. My little girl loved it and so did her parents. Very good.
2,RIO - BluRay,The BluRay movie is a great movie but the disc we purchased has caused us problems from the beginning. The discs doesn't load properly when inserted into BluRay player. We have used the disc in 3 different types of BluRay players and we still have the same issue. Either the disc will not load and/or when it finally loads it locks up in the middle of the movie and you have to completely shut down the BluRay player to force it out. I guess we purchased a bad disc. We have not been pleased.
3,BIRDS OF A FEATHER,"RIO is a big, bright, noisy, colorful animated film from the maker of ICE AGE. The backdrops are sumptuously beautiful and easily the best thing about the movie. Unfortunately, RIO doesn't do anything that we haven't seen before such as FINDING NEMO, ICE AGE, etc. You can predict every scene, what kind of characters will appear, how the leading characters will experience life-changing transformations, etc. The voice performances are adequate, but no real standouts. Jesse Eisenberg's shy, nerdish Blu is typical Jesse as is Anne Hathaway's coquettish Jewel formulaic cuteness. The music is lively but not Oscar worthy. I enjoyed this year's more inventive and quirky RANGO much more. RIO is a good film for families to sit down with some popcorn but I don't think it'll go down as a classic."
3,"Cute movie, but certain parts were not necessary.","If you, as a parent, are not bothered by men being portrayed as dim-witted morons, skimpy animated costumes, and birds bouncing off of butts, then you will love this movie. Those parts really bugged me. Was it even necessary? I mean this is a kids movie...anyway.Overall the movie was very good and was fun to watch, with certain exceptions. The dialog and voice acting was pretty good. I wasn't quite sure how Jessie Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway would work, but I thought they did well together for the voice acting.I wanted to rate this a 5 but I just couldn't. [EngagePrudeMode]I mean, why did the birds have to bounce off of a womans large behind for? It wasn't even that funny. [/EndPrudeMode]"
5,Gotta love Rio,"Great movie, great music and great colors! The kids loved it and the age range is 6 to 15. We laughed and enjoyed it. I really don't want to say much other than that for people that haven't seen it. You won't go wrong buying this movie! Also the shipping was on time and everything in tact when I purchased this movie!"
2,disappointment,"by sending blu-ray to Australia should advise,that region A is not playable on australian blu-ray players,after ordering and receiving few blue-ray disks,we discovered,that some of them recorded in region A(Rio,Girl,who played with fire),and could not be played"
2,Instant viewing purchase,"I purchased this video for instant viewing and because they do not have rights to stream it anymore, it sits uselessly in my video library. I paid the full price to own the video and now I do not even get a credit for not being able to watch it. It would not let me download it before, but I thought it should be fine since it was in my video library. My kids like the movie itself."
3,"Beautiful graphics, wonderful colors, awful plot/script","Rio is beautifully done. Each scene in the movie would be an excellent poster or painting! The whole movie is a pleasure to look at.The voices were done by a fabulous cast, but the acting overall was boring. I would have enjoyed the movie just as much if I had watched the entire thing on mute which was a huge disappointment. The script was disappointing and uninteresting. There was a lot of potential here and it came across as lack-luster.Each scene in itself was cute and quirky. As a whole or analyzed as a movie this was a disappointment. Wait for it to go to the $5 bin."
4,Soooooo cute!,"I loved watching this cute story and I really enjoyed the music throughout the movie! I would highly recommend this movie, especially to families with children, but as an adult without any kids I own it and love watching it!"
5,Rio is a blast!,This movie is great! My children (ages 7 and 10) loved this show. They watch it over and over! The colors throughout this movie are spectacular! The music is catchy and upbeat! The characters are funny and will keep you giggling! I think this is the best movie to come out in the past few months!
4,Just Re-Read This One,"I enjoyed this book so much that I recently re-read it. Ms. Brightwell's characters, with all their flaws, are as large as life itself, plus I enjoy reading stories that are set in the Victorian age."
5,Amazing movie and excellent DVD,"I don't get all these complaints here on Amazon. The DVD I got was perfect. Excellent quality audio and video. Subtitles were good (some parts could have had slightly better translation but I'm picky because I'm an English teacher). The director's commentary was great. Be sure you select the Portuguese audio, not the English audio when you watch the movie. This movie is in Portuguese. You'll get the director's commentary if you select English. BTW, the version I bought here on Amazon was ""Senna [2010, UK] DVD"""
3,Purchase with Caution,"The official web site for this movie listed the USA release date for purchase to own as 3/6/12 in their twitter feed. Amazon has been selling imported copies from Europe of the DVD, Blu-Ray and the Triple Pack. None of these were intended for the US market and may or may not play on the USA player. You can pre-order the USA version elsewhere if you look for it if you don't want to wait for Amazon. The movie is also available for rent on streaming video via Video On Demand from a few different outlets."
5,Starts off Slow - But Turns into a Great Movie,"Amazing! Hard to Describe. The first 20 minutes are a bit slow, but stay with it. It looks like most of the movie was shot with old Super 8 film. But stay with it! It gets better & faster, then better & faster, then better & faster! Fascinating insight into the life of Senna. I have been a casual viewer of F1 for over 20 years, but have not followed it closely. I remember when Senna died and I remember the outpouring of emotion and never really understood why. Now I do. Watch it!"
1,Senna,"I plan to return this, as it is in Portugese or Italian. Oddly enough, you can tell it is actually recrded in English, but dubbed over. Who would sell something like this in the US without some sort of indication?"
5,Senna,I really enjoyed this documentary. I have always followed Formula One racing since the Jackie Stewart days. I was very aware of both Senna and Prost. I always liked Senna better because he was such a daring racer. This documentary captured his intensity and some of the political problems he encountered with Formula One. He was an amazing driver and he is missed. I would recommend this video to anyone who follows Formula One.
1,Better fiction that Harry Potter,"This book is great for followers of Henny Penny, Cocky Locky and advocates of the flat earth. Albrecht is a sensationlist who doesn't let facts get in the way of a good scaring.. Her Orwellian allusions and subjectivism make this a poorly written piece of delusional fiction"
3,When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple,If you are expecting the be uplifted by this book you will be disappointed.I was expecting more humor but left this book feeling depressed.
1,FALLS APART DON'T BUY~~!!!!,This book and others in the same set all fall apart - the binding is TERRIBLE> don't waste money on them. WE didn't make the return deadline... because we were saving them for a birthday gift. What a waste of money.
1,Michno let us down,"I've been really impressed by Gregory Michno, in both Lakota Noon and Indian Wars. However, in this book, it appears he let down his objective intelligent analytical style to go on a crusade, discarding all the research techniques that made LN and Indian Wars so believable. For instance, he could have corroborated Indian Testimony with that of the Army's, a tool which he used very successfully in the past. His failure to even delve into that issue makes it apparent that he had a decision on the whole matter before he even began his research, and only pursued feeble arguments which supported his own theory. His character assassinations of Silas Soule and Major Anthony is a very pathetic excuse to discredit their recorded testimonies in my opinion, and a very boring technique used in politics today to an alarming rate. I look forward to better efforts from him in the future."
5,Love this movie!!,I was excited once I saw this DVD on Amazon. It's a great deal and one of my favorite movies. It is freakin hilarious and you will not regret buying this. It came a day earlier than expected and was in perfect condition. I would definitely recommend this movie.
3,Not as good as the first one,"I'm a child of the 70's and loved the first Arthur. So maybe my expectations were too high. This one just didn't live up to the first one with exception of Helen Mirren. Russell Brand did a good enough job but wasn't impressive. And I was sorely disappointed with the actress who played the character Liza Minelli played. Liza played a strong, unforgettable character. This actress didn't. Helen Mirren, IMO, was the only standout. The first Arthur was a classic, this one isn't. Not a bad movie, just a fair movie."
2,BLAH!,"Wow, I had low expectations for this film knowing that a remake of an iconicmovie is a tough task, but this really missed the mark. While Dudley Moorewas funny and charming, I found Russel Brand just a cheap knock off. It waslike watching a stand up comic do a bad imitation for almost 2 hours! Sadly,while I usually love Helen Mirren, I really missed crotchety old Hobson. Now wecome to Greta Gerwig, who was perfectly fine but really not special in her roleas Arthur's first real love. I just didn't buy the chemistry. Then JenniferGarner...UGH...why they changed the role of Susan so drastically I will never know.She was sweet and unassuming in the original, and that worked with her overprotectivefather. In this new version, she was just a witch. I thought the whole thing wasa disaster and while I laughed out loud during the original, this one had me watchingthe clock in hopes that an end was in sight. Sorry, Arthur...this one should have beenlost in New York City!"
4,Interesting insight to an difficult topic,"Malcom is a well read and experienced person in the area of regulatory practice. Not a lawyer, but cop and enforcer with a practical eye on the operations and how to leverage your people to produce better regulatory outcomes for the community.I was particularly interested in his concepts on the supporting IT systems. No legalese or socio-political analysis, just a practical insight into regulatory practice. I think it's a worthwhile book for anyone in the regulatory industry, be it punitive or administrative enforcement."
5,Favorite flavor,This is my family's favorite flavor. I love the texture and consistency of this mix. Highly recommend it to everyone!
2,Theory Tale,"I would have given this movie another star if I didn't have to endure all the THEORY TALE. The beginning was hard to endure as they tried to indoctrinate everyone with the evolution theory. Remember, it has never been observed.The whole Pangea theory was funny though. To think that the continents drifted apart as if the world was a large pond and the continents were lily pads. Hey, if you take all the water out of the oceans guess what you will find? That's right kids the continents are connected.Once the indoctrination stopped the movie was bearable. It had fairly good shots and a good variety. I think the part about Tibet was the best. You don't learn much about Tibet in your nature docs.The narrator was the kind you want when you tired and bored. Hint, He is boring. His voice was as interesting as watching ants carry food through the grass. It lacked excitement, and it seemed he was labouring."
3,It's not great but good.,It's not one of the best IMAX movies out there. But is very interesting and very well presented. The audio and video are of great quality. The only reason I couldn't rate it great was because 40 min. is too short a time to cover 6 great places in the world. I wish they made it at least 60 min.
2,Not Quite What the Title Promises,"Though the music is lovely, it definately is not the ""Ultimate in Relaxation."" The reason for this is the dolphins actually detract from the serenity. It actually startled me, preventing the relaxation promised."
1,NEW FORMULA TOXIC - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,I have been feeding this dog food to ny dogs for two years without incident.I am so glad I read these reviews because recently I noticed the food looked different when I poured it into my dog's bowls. Soon afterwards I had several of my dogs coming down with recurring bouts of bloody diarrhea. I had no earthly idea what could have been causing the trouble. I just logged onto Amazon to see about automatic shipping of this food and discovered that this brand did in fact have a new fomula change (unbeknownst to me) and that others have been having the same bloody diarrhea in their dogs since the formula changed. I will never ever buy this dog food again! I will never recommend it again. End of story!
2,Burnt food,"I've been buying Natural Balance Duck and Potato for my dog for over 2 years. This is the first time I've every purchased the dry dog food from amazon, and probably the last. This batch was over cooked, has a burnt smell to it. The food is usually a light brown color, this is a dark brown color. Marley is a picky eater, and still eats it, but I would recommend staying away from getting is directly shipped from amazon."
2,RECLAMO,"Deberian vender lo que exhiben en la foto, ya en la compra que realice no me llegó el kit completo; sin lamparas de repuesto ni el switch que exhiben ni tampoco el tipo de cable que aparece en la pantalla."
2,packaging wot a joke,"who's the brain dead moron that designed the packaging,it is meant to protect discs from scratches etc and two stacks of discs on plastic spindles don't do this,shame on sony for thinking so little of us fans,would it really have cost so much to put them in proper plastic cases come on sony pull your fingers out.the picture and sound quality on episodes is genaerally very good and it's nice to finally have season five and thats the reason i have given this two stars otherwise it would be no stars at all,sony you have ripped us off shame on you"
1,Charlie's Angel's The Complete Series,"I just got Charlie's Angel's The Complete Series it Sucks!!!! The DVD's inside are stacked on top of each other. You have seasons 1-2 on one side and seasons 3-5 on the other. The only good thing about it is the artwork is Great! I will be sending mine back to amazon because one of the dvd's came to me damaged and get a refund and wait for Sony to release season 5. Please call Sony at 800-860-2878 and tell them what you think, because Sony does not read these reviews!!!!"
2,WHY?,"Im happy that season 5 is finally going to be available soon after a long wait, but why couldnt they have just released it by itself like seasons 1-4, i wanna see season 5 get alot of art work like season 4 did and i have the feeling cause it is being released in a complete series package it will prob be mostly pics of season 1-3. please sony release this season by itslef."
1,VERY Disappointed,"Our family was very disappointed in this product. We own LOTs of Melissa & Doug puzzles, cutting sits, etc. And purchased this piano for around $35 when Amazon had a sale going on. Was excited to purchase this but when received the product had a very nasty odor and didnt 'air out' for a couple of days. Piano sounds to have one ""sound"". It appears when you hit the keys it is hitting a medal plate. The only plus to this piano is it is very sturdy and well made, expect for the sound, odor and it is very small! Def not correct size for my 1 1/2 & 2 1/2 year old toddlers. Needless to say rather than return piano I just sold this product to a personal indiviual within one week. I will continue to purchase M & D products and have since done so.....Overall would NOT recommend."
4,my baby loves it,"My baby gets a proud look on his face when he ""plays"" his piano. It is so cute. I think he is developing a fondness for music."
2,Bad fumes,"So the piano is shrink wrapped, and then put in an Amazon-labeled box directly in China; the Amazon logo is distorted. This is obviously what the Chinese factory did for these pianos shipped directly to Amazon from China (mine was number 600 or so of a 1500 piano shipment to Amazon). These have never been aired out, and the fumes are really bad. I wouldn't let my child play with it yesterday when we got it and even today I won't -- the fumes are pretty bad whenever the piano is moved. The sound is metallic, like a cheap xylophone. I expected more, though that may have been unreasonable of me. The label for the keys was loose in my container -- the two tiny pieces of double-sided tape had fallen off in shipment prior to my receipt. If the fumes don't clear soon, I'm going to have to send it back to Amazon. On the plus side, it's pretty heavy, and I'm hopeful that it will be durable."
3,Not a bad toy piano,"Overall, this is a nice toy piano. The sound is really good. The bright colors are appealing. Two of the keys stick together. It scratches easily, but my one year old can be tough on toys. My one year old climbs on top of it since it's so small. The first time it got knocked over the top came off but went back on easily. Now the top is a little loose."
3,Decent first piano,"I got this piano for my son for his 1st birthday. While it is very cute and the sound is actually pretty decent, the construction is not the strongest. My son has already managed to chip it, the strip that identifies the notes is just a piece of paper, and the screws always seem to need tightening. That being said, my son seems to like it enough (he occasionally bangs on it) but he usually uses it as a step ladder (more dangerous than cute!). I have recently been very disappointed in the quality of Melissa and Doug products. They always look very cute and it's nice that they are not flashy electronic toys, but quality control is really not the best."
4,Great for younger kids too,"My Mom insisted on buying this for my 1 year old twins even though it suggests that it is suitable for 3 years and up. Well, they love it. They hammer on it, stand on it and pull it over. It is very robust. It is sufficiently in tune to play your favorite songs and comes with a handy little song book (probably more use to a 3 year old than my 1 year olds)."
2,Very Poor Durability,"Based on all of the previous reviews, I felt confident that I was buying a good product. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. I only had the piano for one day and three of the keys messed up after normal play."
3,Nice,"Nice, piano, but I found it a bit heavy, and the sound quality is not really there. My son loved it because he can just bang on the keys, but other than that I wouldn't say it was a great buy. It's a nice looking piece made of real wood with great bright colors, but the it lacked the sound quality I was looking for. I was expecitng something better."
2,Two pianos reduced to pile of parts,"Bought this last Christmas for my toddler grandson. He loved it to death. Unfortunately death came too quickly as we discovered that the cabinet and mechanism are glued together. They came unglued very easily. We obtained a replacement (and an apology) from the toy store, but the second piano proved to be no more durable. Hopefully the American company will demand a lot higher quality from their Chinese manufacturer.Meanwhile my grandson wants another piano."
1,Never there when I need it!,"Bought this book over a year ago. Yet again I needed and example/explanation and this book DOES NOT have it.You're far better of using GOGGLE!! visit the various Oracle forums and search for solutions, that's what I've had to do more often than not when I refer to this book. Save the money!"
4,I choose switch to Cingular long time ago.,"Coverage is really good. I went some places that no signal for other carrier, but Cingular. Roll over minute suit me well as I my use is very fluctuation.Few years customer with T-mobile, and suffer the signal and some overage charge. I should switch to Cingular long time ago."
5,Great interactive book!!!!,"This book is really great it makes toddlers want to help Tad find the various animals that he has lost on his farm, and it teaches counting. The song Tad sings is also very cute (I'm farmer Tad and I have a farm.....) My son is still a little too young to find the corresponding animal in the story, but he likes to watch others, and help press it down to make the animal sound. I totally agree with the other reviews about the decals coming off, my sons are already too. I try to keep him from putting the block in his mouth, but anyone with a 10 month old knows just how easy that is!!!!!! I'm sure he will love this book even more when he is older & can use it all by himself. Great product....especially on car trips!!!!!"
3,Save your money,"May be a better choice for kids old enough to count well and with the dexterity to get the block into the hole. We have had the toy for a year and my 21 month-old daughter still gets easily frustrated with it. It is a cool idea, but she's learning more counting the number of items in a bowl, etc. Also, the volume control is a great idea, however, the louder setting is too great a tempation for my 4 1/2 year old son. It's really annoying."
5,Love it,My son loves this toy and we both dance to the music part. He now uses the block as a chew or bite toy I can't really tell the difference
1,"Not much loon sounds, and music was repetitive","I was disappointed with this CD and would have returned it after listening to it (if this was allowed by Amazon). The loon sounds were only for the first minute or two, after that it was just melody. The melody was nice but very repetitive. I don't recommend purchasing this unless you either listen to it first, or have enjoyed others in the series."
4,Gift for Nephew,The item was purchased as a gift for my nephew it arrived on time and in the condition as discribed Im satisfied with the purchase
3,Gilmore Girls DVD - Blank disc?,"I was really happy when I found this set at such a good price. I bought them for my mothers birthday and she was so surprised and happy! The shipping was super fast which was nice since I waited until the last minute to order :) Last night though, my mother told me that one of the disks was blank. I'm not very happy about the fact that we will be missing those shows and will probably never see them since we do not have cable or dish network. I would think that before selling an item to someone, that person would check the product to make sure it was functioning correctly. Ecspecially since the product was used and already open. Ive never ran across a product that did not function like it should from Amazon. Im not sure what to do about the blank disk. I just hope other people don't get the same problem I ran across."
4,It's just plain fun!,"It really has no educational value, but it's on the cement and has taken quite a beating and has held up well! Very good value!"
5,So much FUN!!!,"My three kids LOVE this. I asked them how many stars to give this tunnel, and my 6 year old said ""a thousand""! My two year old filled it up with pillows, blankets and books today. She can stand up inside it, and I hear her in there jabbering away. My 6 and 8 year olds love to lay in it and roll across the floor. It is constructed of nylon, so it doesn't seem like it will tear like the plastic tunnels have. It folds flat in a matter of seconds, and could easily be stored under a bed. I think this will be a great rainy day toy indoors, and tons of fun in the yard this summer."
5,Great Music,"These are 5 of the movies Bing made during the 30's & early 40's that didn't have much of a plot, but introduced music that still sounds great. A lot of people don't realize the extent of his popularity world-wide from 1931 until his death in 1977. I would hope that more of these early films would be published for fans like me to enjoy, such as Paris Honeymoon & College Humor etc."
4,So Red the Rose Review,I loved this CD the first time. I lost it when I moved from San Francisco to Indianapolis. I am so happy to have it again. I loved the DVD also. It is always fun to see the work that goes into the videos.
1,Broken,"Less than a day after we presented this toy for my daughter's birthday, it no longer worked. It still makes noises, but does not move. I've replaced the batteries thinking that might have been the problem--it wasn't."
5,EXCELLENT TOY FOR CHILD WITH LANGUAGE DELAYS...,MY SON IS THREE AND HAS MODERATE LANGUAGE DELAY. THIS TRAIN HAS HELPED HIM TO UNDERSTAND PHONICS WITHOUT KNOWING IT. AS WITH MOST 3 YEAR OLD BOYS HE HAS A SHORT ATTENTION SPAN BUT THIS TOY KEEPS HIM INTERESTED FOR A PRETTY LONG TIME. GREAT TOY GREAT PRICE.
3,Too many batteries!,"While I (and my 2-1/2 yr old son) love the songs and the sounds - it goes through batteries like mad. It wouldn't be so bad to just use rechargeables, but they run low after so few turns around the track that the time it takes to constantly reload the batteries doesn't make it worth it. Also - for some reason kids don't want to wait that long... just have Mommy SIT THERE and give the train a shove every time it rounds turn 2. Ack! Great concept and durable as can be, but so not worth the $$."
3,Interesting Deck of cards,"I like these cards and still working with them daily. It great that the meaning of the cards are describe on them however sometimes when I do a reading the cards do not make sense or I may not have the hang stringing the meaning together to make sense of the question I asked. There are a lot of cards and the bag that came with them teared, however once put into a bag it can make it easier to shuffle and select cards for reading. Not a bad set of cards but as I said still working with them to see if this will be my number one card deck to use."
2,I expected a better product,"I liked these paddles right out of the package. Looked and felt like a pretty good deal. Got them at Christmas time and they have been used a handful of times. We're not thru February yet and the rubbers are peeling off the paddles. I wasn't expecting great quality, but peeling after a few weeks is not acceptable. In the set of four paddles we have only used two of them and they are both peeling. It's not a good value if it is trash this quickly. I guess paying more for better quality might end up being cheaper in this case."
5,A wonderful book that will touch your heart!!!!!!!!!!,I loved reading this book. I could not make myself put it down. It is a story about faith and love. It will make you laugh and make you cry. It reminds the readers that we are not so different after all. This is one of the best books I have ever read. I would urge all of you to read it. You will simply fall in love with it!
3,Good story but too many stereotypes,"Austin tells a good story and is a good writer, but this isn't her best. Characters are mostly undeveloped and stereotypical, weakening even the strongest parts of the book, especially the African-American characters. The heroine is likable enough but her story is told with too much narrative, causing parts of the book to drag. Too many scenes are told instead of being shown in action, making it feel flat in several places.It's still a good story but too many like it have already been written."
4,Civil War facts,"I am in the middle of reading it right now, and am enjoying it very much, Just one problem, The author refers to the southernforces as ""the army of the potomac"" in fact that was the name of union forces, the southern troops were called the ""army of northern virginia"" I dont have a problem with poetic license but blantant inacuracy is anoying.I would have liked the main character to start doing for herself alot sooner, She knew slavery was wrong but didnt undress herself ????but that was who she was, someone growing.."
4,great deal on a very good computer,"Have had this computer for about 6 months now and have no complaints about the computer. Got a great deal from Staples. Just pays to check out the local boys now and again.....HOWEVER, would have given this 5 stars except for the one time I had to contact customer service, you guessed it, to the far off land of India I was sent to have a wonderful time trying to explain to a non-english speaking person the problem I was having. Needless to say, I got nothing accomplished and thank god I have a brother who is great with this stuff. HP!!!Do us all a favor and quit outsourcing!! Horrible experience."
4,Just Like Floss,"I recently purchased Just Like Floss for my 4 year old, and it has become an instant favorite. Just like Floss tells the story of a border collie and her pups, and how the children on the farm go about chosing the puppy they will keep. The illustrations are beautiful, and the story line is one that all will enjoy. It reveals to even the very young reader, some of the characteristics of border collies. Having owned a border collie on a working farm, I enjoy reading this book to my daughter, as it brings back pleasant memories for her. I reccomend Just like Floss to owners of border collies or the general dog enthusiast."
2,Very Poor and out-of-date guide,"This reference guide on speech recognition is actually pretty incomplete, and poorly written !!! Not recommended."
4,good for starter,"If you don't want to spend a lot, it is a good idea to go with this pair for girls who take basic classes. My only gripe is that ankle support becomes softer after one month. Well, considering the price, I should not complain about this."
3,"Full of information, but it needs a revision","The book has a decent amount of technical information although it lacks the organization found in other books of its kind.Also, the screenshot quality is horrendous and it has many typos.I also didn't like the fact that it didn't cover such an important tool as App. Engine. It's basically an App. Designer, PeopleCode book with a small, although useful SQR section.But... you need to give credit to the author for putting the effort and delivering something for the PeopleSoft developer community. Other than this book there is virtually nothing else worth purchasing for version 8.xThe book price deserves a revision as well.Consider the caveats before purchasing. You should buy this book only if you are new to PeopleCode and your company or yourself cannot afford a PeopleCode and/or SQR course.I would wait for a new edition."
2,Good Basic Information / Bad Quality Binding,"I am a mid-level PeopleSoft developer and found a lot of useful information in this book. If you are an expert this book is not for you. If you are new or your company won't spend money to train you then this book will be helpful. NOTE: the construction quality is severely lacking. It looks like it was printed from a Word Processing program and bound in someone's garage. My book fell apart after a couple of months. The other books from this author/publisher were all good quality, but this one looks like it was put together by someone in jr high."
5,One of my favorites on the subject of Vintage Fashions,"I love this book. I repeatedly use it for reference, although it isn't written in that format. Terry has an amusing way of making researching Vintage Fashions fun & interesting."
2,Not what I expected,"We love Ken Davis in person, he is a great comedienne. We wanted to be entertained like when he is live and it was good but more like a church service. Our problem because we thought everything he did was funny."
2,Awful.,"Let me just be succinct here; this was painful to watch. Mickey Rooney as Puck was irritating and obnoxious to the point where I actually began muting the television every time he appeared. That in itself completely ruined the movie for me. In addition, the flow was very slow and dull, punctuated by long scenes without any dialogue. Otherwise, it was not too objectionable, and in fact I enjoyed the costumes and choreography, but I will not be viewing this version again. I'd much rather deal with Michael Hoffman's version, better known as the one with Callista Flockhart. The latter is funnier, warmer, and infinitely less annoying."
5,"Okay, it's old-fashioned.","This would never pass for a Shakespeare performance today. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I've seen this film several times and always loved it. Yes, it's a bit hokey, the lovers are bores - played in a perhaps deliberately wooden style that I personally think works well in the film - Puck may range beyond the demonic into the hysterical, and the staging can be rather affected, Hollywood parading its 1930s pseudo-intellectual qualifications. But Shakespeare has survived much worse, and certainly much blander treatment. At moments, this is one of the most beautiful B&W movies I've seen - it simply glows. In my opinion, this version is well worth seeing; it's my personal favourite film of the play. You only have to be willing to allow for the fact that styles of Shakespearian interpretation, as well as fashions in movies, do change over time. No doubt we'd be appalled today if we saw any of the productions Shakespeare himself had a hand in."
4,no talkie!,"this is a very strange william shakespere movie.ive heard its possible that many writers made him up and collaborated all his fantastic works.i say fantastic brecause people think yhey are.i dont.this is the only one i liked.the story,i think,is about a girl who gets lost in the woods and encounters many odd creatures of a monster/magical nature.she eventualy leaves.without sound its hard to say.but,its visualy excellent.it was a gem in its day.if you can get the kids to watch a black and white film,theyll like it.its a fantasy type film.its the most expensive movie ever in the 30s.its far better than any other shakespere movire ive ever seen.any true movie lover should check it out.the special effects were top of the line then."
3,amazon has new version actors labled her instead of 1930's actors,I had ordered and then canceled because I was not sure if this was the real 1930's movie or not. Amazon has current day actors on the top of the page instead of Cagney and others.Herb
3,Not as nice as I expected,"I bought this book because another reviewer had stated that the whimsical, star designs went throughout the book. They do not. Each page is very minimalist and plain - far too stark to be considered like a faerie tale (like I was hoping)."
1,"Ignores key issues of class, race, and gender","How could a book about labour ignore the most important issues of social class, race, and gender? The book is really a collection of rah-rah essays on unions in America lacking in any analysis and rigor about the lives of workers in the U.S. An obsequious effort to gather all perspectives without taking a position. Why is there no critical examination of issues of race in this work? The work does not have any essay by rank-and-file workers and seems to see the unions moving ahead by continuing in their old ways."
2,should be mandatory...,"... for everybody who wants to become an American ""War Hero"".the movie is shocking, sad and depressing in its honesty about the casualties of war. it shows the daily struggles of our finest when they return to their civil life, after being sent to one of the ""playgrounds"" of America's imperialistic aspirations on the chess board of the greedy ruling elite - when they find themselves injured, maimed, and traumatized for the rest of their lives.watch it & share it with the young impressionable kids that all tooeasily fall for the heroic rhetoric of our Government and its always obedient propaganda machine - the corporate ""Media""."
4,The Music is the Thing,"Pavarotti voice flows through this great music. The kudos for both incredible voice AND saucy acting goes to the lovely Kathleen Battle, ever so spoiled in her role and generous with her upper register. Most funny was Dara as the doctor, I never doubted him for a moment. Luciano, for me, sometimes seems to be winking at us self-consciously, like this is not really me, see me act like a country peasant. Then his great and extended voice grabs me and I feel honored to be in the presence of his singing and Donizetti's music. Afterwards, I felt what a great night at the opera! I'm going back again."
4,Italian at its best,"Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore is a wonderful opera. Light, entertaining and distracting us from all evil things going on in the world. But also reminding us how easily we all are fooled by these charlatans who know the art of changing our hopes into money in their own pockets. The performance claims for both singing and acting and the winner is Mr Battle who is absolutely outstanding as the convincing seller of the functional food of the time, l'elisir d'amore - the love-potion. Miss Battle is also very good with a wonderful, sensitive voice. Of course, Pavarotti is the great tenor but here also confirming his often less successful talent as an actor. Unfortunately his voice can't always compensate his woody performance and (too) impressive body - reducing the rating from 5 stars to 4. Maestro Levine is the ideal conductor to keep it all together with both humour and discipline."
1,Terribled,I ordered Family Guy: Freakin' Sweet Pack for my son for Christmas when he played the DVD's all but 2 were defective I called Amazon and they sent out a shipping label and also sent a replacement set. When my son played the second set it was just a bad he could not even make one complete set out of both. I contacted Amazon again and they e mailed me a return shipping label. Although I am very unhappy about my purchase I am very satisfied with the way Amazon is handeling the problem and will continue to purchase from them because of this. I feel this was a defective batch of DVD'sFamily Guy: Freakin' Sweet Party Packthey purchased and they should not be responsible for that.
2,"bad shipping, dvds don't work","The shipping package was sub par. There was a hole in the top of the box which I assume is what led to the product packing being damaged. There was a corner dented in. So far, two of the dvds skip all of the way through the disc. I thought it was the dvd player at first but tried on another player and unfortunately not the case. The ping pong is fun. This was a gift and the recipient loves it, but I wish it worked and arrived in good condition!"
4,"Brian Wayne Wells, Esquire, reviews ""The Marcos Dynasty""","This book by Sterling Segrave is a very nice modern history of the Phillipines. Starting with the Second World War the book brings the reader nearly up to date on events which have ocurred in the Phillipines since that time.An investigative journalist who was raised in the Orient, Sterling Seagrave tells the story of the Marcos regime bluntly with no glossing over of the rough edges. All in all it is a delightful read."
5,GOOD!!!,"I LIKED THIS MOVIE. I LIKED ANGUS HE WAS WEIRD!!!! I LIKED HARRY EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A DRUNK. BUT, THIS MOVIE IS SO STRANGE. IT WAS A TRIP HOW HARRY WAS TAKING A SHOWER AND DIED AND THEN BETTE SET ITUP WHERE THE TRAILER WENT OVER THE CLIFF AND DIED AND SHE WAS STILL ABLE TO RECEIVE THE MONEY FROM THE INSURANCE POLICY. HER AND HER BOYFRIEND HAD GOT BCK TOGETHER. I THINK IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE AND I ENJOYED IT..."
1,This movie was a jinx!,"Bette tried hard for this movie, and even though I am her biggest fan, I have to say this movie was bottom of the list. I did'nt see a plot, or even point in it. Same with Scenes From A Mall. We all know she can do better than that."
4,Great bible study tool!,This is a great tool for studying the bible. My only complaint is that the Hebrew text is hard to read because it is small and a bit blurry. This book is the first full interlinear bible that I have seen. It has a pronunciation guide and other grammatical helps in the beginning. It is very good for looking up passages and getting the word for word in the original language. I'm sure it will help me in my study of God's holy and inspired word.
1,Biggest Amazon mistake I ever made!,"I have two complaints with this product. The font size is not only ""small,"" as some reviews said, it is downright ""tiny""! So I returned it and received a shock with the ""restocking"" fee(first time I've had that on Amazon)! My total cost was $42.46; my refund was $23.22. Very disappointed."
3,New Testament needs Hebrew translation added,"This is a great source of information. I like the detail of the word descriptions, and the quality of the book. I would like to see the Hebrew / English continue throughout the entire book. It ended at the New Testament and changed to Greek / English. It would have been so much better to see Hebrew / Greek / English New Testament."
1,Not so good,"The type is too small causing the English words to be squeezed together. Even with magnification it's hard to read. This book lacks authenticity in my estimation. The Publisher says it was written this way to stop confusion. The whole book reads left to right. Hebrew reads right to left and Greek right to left. By writing Hebrew left to right it creates confusion and makes it difficult to read. I would not recommend this book, so please save your money and your eyes."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for an exact interpretation of the original Hebrew/Greek text, not the actual Hebrew/ Greek text itself with it's English interpretation; which I imagine not that many people can actually read or comprehend. That being said I probably could have gotten over that fact had it not been for the incredibly small print required to fit all that text on a page. Bottom line I had to return for a refund."
3,No end in sight...,"Felt this book was a good read until the end. There was also no distinct climax of the story. Also, the end just drapped off, leaving the reader without any feeling of completeness."
4,put Steely Dan on the charts.,"this is the album that put Steely Dan on the charts and propelled them to stardom. RIKKI DON'T LOSE THAT NUMBER is a great pop song and the rest of the album varies from rock/jazz to be-bop(ST LOUIS TOODLE DO). You see the roots from where Becker and Fagan are trying to create and it's from here that their artistry grew and gave us AJA, KATY LIED, ROYAL SCAM and CAN'T BUY A THRILL. A very good album not the towering masterpiece as the later works but still a very good piece of music."
5,great music again,"this album is a nice treat, maybe you could find some on a greatest hits album but not all these nice nuggets."
3,Expected more..,"I was sorta disappointed with this book. I expected more wide-angled shots, instead i get endless queues of close-ups. Monochrome Home makes a nice coffee-table book nevertheless, but if you're seeking pages and pages of pretty examples with varied shots..then forget this..browse on."
1,Volume adjustment disaster,"I was very disappointed with this CD. With all the rave reviews, I was looking forward to hearing a great version of Mendellsohn'n Violin Concerto. But--after the 1st full orchestra section ended I couldn't hear it at all. At normal volume you can not hear the solo. Even where the smaller section of the orchestra is playing, you have to turn it up. But when you do that and the full orchestra comes back on, you get blasted out. I would not recommend this CD, unless you won't get distracted from turning the volume up and down every 30 seconds. Whoever was the sound editor on this CD did a lousy job. It might have been wonderfully played at the time,who knows, but with the constant volume adjustments, it comes across as all in pieces. I felt like I wasted my money."
4,More than meets the eye,"21-hour flights to Australia can be a tedious affair, but thanks to John Saul's sleepwalk, I managed to stay entertained.This book contains a lot more than meets the eye. The back cover description is a little on the cheesy side, something about a person who hates teenagers, those troublemakers, they must die!But Saul weaves together great characters and great suspense into something that gradually builds into a truly horrifying concept: The evils that can grow from mass corporate greed and the extent to which it's lords will go to turn everyone into loyal minions and servants.Especially interesting are the chapters about Borrego oil and it's struggles with their Union. Well done Mr. Saul!"
1,Big disappointment,"I'll keep it short... this is a highly creative approach to making a film, but the material was not funny. Nobody even laughed once while we watched this film. I already sold my copy to a local record store. Don't bother...."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Far superior to The Condemned, the American quasi-remake/rip-off, Battle Royale takes the inherently-compelling premise of a group of people stuck in a isolated place forced to fight to the death and milks it for all its worth; if you're the type of person who finds that plot description appealing (you know who you are!) then rent or buy this very interesting film."
2,Very Immature,There is literally no content/ plot or anything that makes this movie worth watching save for some really lousy graphics in deaths. So I guess the Hunger Games really did copy this movie verbatim.
4,Audacious,"I'm not a fan of gore or violence. I wasn't sure this would be my thing. It is one of the most audacious and shocking things I have ever seen, and I found myself liking it in spite of myself. I've never seen anything quite like it. It is like the most vividly captured nightmare ever."
2,it was ok,"Not that understanding because it's all in foreign language. Subtitle s are moving by to fast, also not a whole lot of action."
4,"Interesting, to say the least","I found this movie by mistake while I was reading reviews about the film, ""The Hunger Games."" One reviewer claims the author of the book of the same name loosely adapted the story from, ""Battle Royale."" Having yet to go see, ""The Hunger Games"" I cannot provide any information regarding any similarities between the two films.Researching more, rumors about a re-make is in the works in Hollywood. Can't wait to see that one. Anyway, back to this version. I can't say its the greatest movie in the world, nor can I say it is the worst movie ever made, nevertheless the theme of the movie is disturbing, which is why I gave the movie four stars. I found it plausible for society today to implement a plan to discipline, not just kids, but anyone who is unruly in society. If you have a chance, watch this one. Also would like to recommend, ""The Running Man"" 1987, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger."
3,"Good, but...","I liked this movie, but if you have read the book, you will be disappointed. The movie only loosely follows the book, and lots of the depth is lost."
3,A Very Violent Yet Worthy Film,"I am a big fan of Japanese film and was eiger to see this title. Just the premise of 42 9th grade juvenile delinquents set loose on a deserted island with the objective of killing each other to win their own lives was intriguing. It was very violent but not as bad as I expected. It was no more violent than the director's cut of Robocop. Still, a bunch of kids in school uniforms going on a murderous rampage was kind of unsettling. It's not a wonder why it was pulled from Japanese theatres. I don't think this will ever make it to US theatres without an NC-17 rating.There is a current of dark humor running through the film and it is for this that I give the movie 3 stars. It also seems to be a parody of the currently popular reality TV shows. Although I have mixed feelings about it, I'm glad I saw it."
3,for the serious Kiss fan only,"Im a big Kiss fan, but this was kinda of disapointing even to me. Kiss the second coming is a documentary of the bands 1996-97 reunion tour. Not much that was really insightful or new to die hard kiss fans, which by the way are the only people who will probably buy this anyway. An actual concert video would have been much better...nuff said. P.S. I still love em"
3,Quality could've been better,"KISS is pure entertainment. Always have been, and they continue to do it better than anyone else. I have followed them for 30 years, since I was a kid. They have never skimped on anything. Everything about them was always bigger, better, louder, flashier, cooler than anyone or anything. The shows are over the top, merchandising is insane (KISS condoms! KISS coffin! You name it, it probably exists...) the songs rock, the characters are classic. So what I don't understand is why the video quality on the DVD is sub-par. The program content is awesome, but it doesn't look any better than the VHS version I own. It is so grainy and washed out that I wonder if I don't have a bootleg, perhaps actually recorded from a VHS tape! My DVD player is top notch, so it's not an equipment issue. Still entertaining, but the video quality is a let down. For the first time in 30 years, I'm disappointed."
4,second coming..probably the third time you have seen it,"i love kiss, and enjoyed this video a great deal. watching gene, paul and ace do the macareena in 7 inch platforms was pretty cool too. While much of this video does nothing more than rehash material that you have probably already purchased (Exteme Closeup) it is a great journal of the reunion tour of '96-97. The European and Japanese tour footage is fantastic. I have seen a few reviews stating that there is a problem w/ picture quality. I have no idea where that comes from except an inferior DVD player. In some cases the material is reproduced from 25 year old source footage, and this probably accounts for any ""picture problems."" This is a must for rock and roll fans, and optional for KISS fans who already own the ""second coming"" or ""extreme closeup"" vhs releases (but you know you will buy this it anyway!)."
2,"The ""stinking"" coming!","I think this DVD stink. The picture quality is lousy, it's even worse than VHS, and so is the content. The DVD is all about telling everybody how big they were and braging about women, money, how influential they have been, etc, etc. That we already new. The DVD dosen't contain much good material except the three live songs they have put as extra material on the disc. Except from that three songs they don't show much performances, just short lousy clips. KISS! Better than that you can achive! We true KISS fans want a full time live DVD!"
1,A MUST NOT FOR ALL KISS FANS...,"THis is my ""LAST COMING"" for KISS. I had enought of their cheap tricks. This DVD has nothing, no live footage, no complete set of live songs, no straight ahead interview. It's made of bad edition, each tak takes less than one second!! Also, one can clearly see that there's absolutely no chemistry anymore between Ace /Criss versus Stanley / Simmons.Also, one must remember that is a product talking about the reunion tour after the swindle of PSYCHO CIRCUS, an album where Criss and Frehley were credited but where, in truth, they barely played!!!..."
1,There's only *one* saving grace for this book.,"Since the code samples in this book are positively rife with typos, it forces the reader (if truly interested) to seek out the correct answers from other sources, and to experiment until something actually works. So I suppose that's intensive, but certainly not my favorite way to learn. *Why* didn't I keep my receipt? The code samples on the companion web site are also wrong. Incidentally, I sent an email to customer service. As expected. No response. AVOID!"
1,Typos are terrible!,"I agree as well with these other reviews! One thought though; maybe they were intentional, I think I learned more from troubleshooting the code and figuring out what was wrong. I had to use other books and the internet to do it though!!! Buy a different book!!"
2,I agree with you all!!!!,I would have to say read all the reviews before you buy this book. Because everyone here I agree with! You were warned!
2,Do Not Buy!!!,"My first one was great then it just stopped working and apparently I blew the fuse even though I don't listen to my music loudly, and the second one just did the same thing. Very poor fuse."
1,"Poor circuits, blew fuse, no customer service","DO NOT BUY THIS, IT WILL BREAK AND BLOW FUSES! Read the 2 star reviews, this is a common problem and customer service will not help you. After a few months of use this subwoofer blew a fuse for no reason. I brought it to a speaker repair shop, and they said Polk would not even help them troubleshoot the KNOWN and common problem. The blowing of fuses is an electrical problem in the circuit design, it has nothing to do with use or how loud you listen to it. I now have a large, brand new, stool...because it could not be repaired."
3,Beware -- the Other Reviewer works for them,Good reference book - shouldn't be shilled by employees...
2,Disappointment,I have enjoyed all of Faye Kellerman's other books and bought this the day it came out. I was very disappointed; there was little or no suspense or mystery. It is certainly not a page turner! The relationship between Cindy and Koby was neither interesting or believable. I hope the next book focuses on the older generation!
3,A Link in the Decker Family Saga,"I have read most of Faye Kellerman's mysteries and eagerly await the new ones. I go back and forth on whether she or her husband, Jonathan, is the better writer. Street Dreams, unfortunately is her weakest effort, and is not really a complete novel. For those who have read her prior books, Street Dreams is worth the time because it continues the story lines of the series. However, it is really several segments pieced together (with a chase scene for a little excitement) that should have been included in separate books. This is the last Faye Kellerman book I would recommend to a new reader."
2,Bring back Rina and Pete,"Sad to say, Faye Kellerman, although ostensibly female, has no knack whatsoever for writing from the perspective of a female character. The one-dimensional quality of Rina (do we know much about her other than her hair is ebony and her eyes are blue?) in previous Decker novels should have warned me, but I laid out the bucks for ""Street Dreams"" anyway and had to force myself to finish it. Cindy's every action and scrap of dialogue is patently unbelieveable and forced--she's like Pete Decker in drag without the religious convictions that make him interesting. The boyfriend comes off as some kind of politically correct composite culled from a Frum Harlequin romance. The plot never comes together either, despite a nice twist toward the end. Do yourself a favor if you're in the mood for a mystery starring a woman, read Sara Paretsky or Sue Grafton instead."
2,Kids's toy!,"Very poorly built unit. Tape deck is ok, cd keeps skipping. So i do not use cd. Lot of flutter with built in speaker. sound is not clear. This unit does come with a lot of features.. cd+g function, if the cd stop skipping, echo, Music out phono plugs. Use this to hook up to reciever to bypass the flutter problem. SINGING MACHINE manufactures better products. Even their entry level units are better."
4,Lots of cook options,"Cooks great, rice can sit in unit for over a day and still appear fresh. Has many different cook modes , but have only used regular cook time and quick cook rice, sushi, and brown."
4,Good for the money,Not too expensive and it's good for the small jobs that would need a little help with. Good for head gasket's deffinitly since they are a [...] load harder to do alone without a book. This is also handy since I have a tight budget and need to save money. It does tend to tell you to go to a porsche dealer on harder tasks alot. So overall this is not ment for the complete overhaul but most of the small annoy and expensive stuff. A head gasket job alone can cost you $600. While if you buy the head gasket for $[...] and then do it yourself with a $[...] book. You just saved a big amount of money and time since you dont need to leave your car at the shop. Recommended for people who need assistence deffinitly.
3,"Not as good as the factory manual set, but worth the money!","An adequate manual for performing most routinemaintenance and repairs on the 944. Very sketchyin the area of cam and balance belt replacementbut certainly contains enough useful informationto allow the home mechanic to change fluids,brake pads, service CV joints, wheel bearings, etc.I used it as a basic reference to change a headgasket!"
5,A Don of Dons,"I own four Don Giovanni. This one was absolutely great. A great cast Fleming,Terfel,Hong and Kringelborn. You don't find that many great voices in one performance. It truly is one of my four best. 2 DVD's with DTS,5.1 or stereo. There was nothing to complain about in this performance. [...]"
1,Damaged Merchandise,This item is a damaged trio of DVD's in a smashed plastic DVD case contained within an undamaged colorful cardboard box. The DVD's are damaged and can't be used.
1,still waiting,"I ordered this product but as yet have not received it....its now August 2nd Its weeks since I ordered this collection, hence I cannot review this item...very dissapointed in the service."
1,zzz...,"They have to be one of the most boring acoustic indie pop bandsi've come across. The only comparisons to belle and sebastian i see are the use of the same instruments and producer. The songs as a whole are monotonous. You can stop a song in the middle and play the next track starting from the middle, and you'd think it's the same song. At least change the melody/arrangement/dynamics of the vocals or sOMeTHIng. I'm sure they're talented; the quality is not bad; just boring."
1,Problem with screws,"We were installing these by hand after drilling a hole for the screws and a screw head broke off, it left the metal shaft in the wall. We had to dig out the metal piece and we tried again. Figured ok, one defective screw. Same thing happened again and we had to dig out another metal piece from the wall. One bad screw ok, but 2, and then to have sharp metal shafts left in the wall that we had to try and dig out. We were trying to make the blinds safer but not by leaving metal pieces in our walls."
5,Cow hooves for dogs. They are as advertized.,The cow hooves came loose in a box. My dog is chewing on one now. He likes them. These cow hooves are of various sizes some are large. They are what was advertised.
2,Feed with caution,"This review is a generalization of all hoof treats, not an indication that this particular brand is different than others I have tried.Many dogs seem to have little problem with hooves. When I tried these, they seemed to be on par with other good quality manufacturers. My problems with them is three-fold. First, they have a tendency to splinter; and since most dogs tend to swallow faster than they taste, I became quite concerned my dog might sustain internal injury from those shards. Second, the aftermath was a bout of diarrhea. However, my dog has a sensitive gut, so take that for what it is worth. Lastly, and of least concern, is that they stink horribly. I know dogs tend to like things that stink, but holy moly. When my dog plopped down next to me in the office after eating her first one, I thought she had eaten a rancid Yak!"
3,Not Great for CDs,"I purchased this to replace my 10-year old Sony CD player. I also wanted it for DVDs, for which I have no complaints. However, as a CD/MP3 player, I wished the next model up would have been available at the time. The price is great, but the unit missing many of the features I was hoping for (program tracks, random play, auto-fade) that make it a compelling option for CDs and MP3 discs."
1,Stay away from this DVD player,"I received this Sony DVD player as a Christmas presentand within 2 weeks it began giving me an error messagethat said ""Cannot Play Disc"". I tried several brand newDVDs and even went out and bought a DVD lens cleaner kitall to no avail.Now it will only play CDs but no DVDs.I'm stuck because I didn't save my receiptand the cost of repair is as much as a new DVD player.After doing research on the internet I found that SONYhas a history with these types of problems.Stay away from this DVD player!"
4,"Interesting structure, unflinching look at ""plan B"" lives.","I chose this book for our book club based upon reader's reviews. While I enjoyed the book I didn't find any of the humor referenced in the reviews. Instead the summation of the book's tone is in one of the final chapters defining Bunty's version of love and mothering as autistic - an autism we readers have keenly witnessed through all the pages. This is a sharp, realistic read with no veneer. I felt so much sadness for Ruby and wished for more pages of exultation at the novel's end to celebrate her knowledge that she is ""Ruby Lennox, a precious jewel.""For a humorous, more joyful exploration of dysfunctional families and the imprint they make on lives I recommend The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."
3,Hollywood ending part of novel's popularity?,"This novel is a multi-generational tale told in non-linear fashion. It is a tale of dysfunctional marriages, disillusioned wives, and parents who don't love their children enough. Atkinson is a good enough writer to carry it off, but I am not sure why. The most worthwhile aspect was the first person narrative of Ruby, a child growing up little loved. Could the Hollywood ending be part of the novel's popularity?Here is a good, representative passage: ""...Our Lady of the Kitchen, who is pretending to dish out pork chops, mashed potatoes and carrots, but is really shooting our steel tension wires from her fingertips. They make little noises as they hit the walls of the bedrooms, the living-room, the front of the Shop, the occasional Pet. Ping! Ping! Ping! Until the whole house is criss-crossed with the metal web of Bunty's thoughts."""
3,Discouraging,"This story is Ruby's life, narrated by Ruby herself from the moment of conception until her adulthood. In addition to her own story, this novel also drifts off through other branches of Ruby's family tree, showing bits and pieces of the lives of Ruby's grandparents, great-grandparents, and various other relatives.I really liked the structure of the book, the alternating chapters that went back in time to explain bits and pieces of other family dynamics.I really disliked the big secret reveal, and thought the story would have been much better without throwing that in there. I also found the lives of the characters incredibly discouraging. Not a single married couple was happy. None of the children had a normal, loving upbringing. Everyone was unhappy and dysfunctional, and the tone of the story was simply depressing."
4,Belated discovery,"I came across this book in a second-hand book shop. What a discovery! I don't know how I missed it during the 12 years since it was first published. It is astonishing. Apart from some misgivings about the beginning (I found the account delivered from the womb to be contrived) and some initial adjustments required by the chronological back-and-forth, once I was on board there was no stopping. Akinson transports the reader on an emotional voyage, rich and dense in detail. Through a combination of blunt dialog, descriptive mastery and mute innuendo she conveys a completely credible account of a strained society and a troubled family in its midst. A family freighted with its peculiar secrets and cruelties. But the main character's story is told with plenty of dark humour. And the saga is told with exquisite compassion. ""Behind the scenes at the Museum"" is a tour de force."
4,A very good read,"This is the second Kate Atkinson book I have read, and I enjoyed it very much. Occasionally I had to back track with a lot of changes in time and a large cast of characters. I grew up in England and really enjoyed some of the comments that were particularly English and of the time period I remember. Anyone who enjoys a good narrative tale will enjoy this. The ending is particularly satisfying. Those like me who are getting a bit older might find it useful to get a pencil and paper and make a family tree of the characters as they appear in the book!"
1,I dont know how people give this a decent review,This brush doesnt work on furniture at all. My hand does a better job at gathering hair on the couch. I dont recommend this brush for anyone. The good reviews are probably the manufacturer trying to make the product look decent. A regular brush does a much better job at gathering hair on the couch.
1,Doesn;t work for a lot of hair,This brush is pretty weak. It is really bad if your animal has a lot of hair. I have a domestic short hair with a thick coat and this does absolutely nothing except push around the hair and make it airborne. It also does an inadequate job of removing hair from clothes/fruniture
5,2011 VERSION HAS DRAIN PLUG,"This pool was given as a gift to my girls on their combined 1st and 3rd Birthday Party. I was a little hesitant at first, with all the parts I had to blow up!. A pump is a must for this pool! But, since I have blown it up, it has been great. I have had no problems with the rainbow falling down or pool parts deflating. And YES FOLKS THEY ADDED DRAIN HOLES FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE POOL!!! Hooray!!!! We where worried about that after reading the reviews! Great pool for a 1 and 3 year old!"
3,Very dated,"If you like short stories about a Sherlock Holmes type character, here you go. However the Sherlock Holmes stories are much better written and more in depth. Sayers stories are almost too ""short and to the point"". Not a rich read. After reading about half the book I quit. The stories are all so similar that I simply lost interest in reading any more of them. It might be a book more interesting to a ten year old."
2,Buy a size bigger!!,"Returning these shoes was heartbreaking but, there was no way around it. The shoe repair shop said they could not stretch them enough to fit comfortably. I bought a size 10 in burgundy and the size is like a 9. They are very beautiful, sexy, and well made shoes. I wish designers would get a clue and make clothes and shoes true to size."
3,On time but,"We received what we ordered on time, but the mask was broken (in a small way, almost imperceptible) and so far we had to stitch back the velcro a few times."
1,Buyer beware.....iRiver support is terrible,"Overall, I was pleased with the product until it just stopped working. The fine folks at iRiver have informed me that since I don't have my original receipt (it was a gift) and any valid proof of purchase they couldn't help me even though it was still under warranty. To add insult to injury, when I complained they were not standing behind their product, they informed me that they would stand behind their product and service the product past the warranty date ""IF"" I had proof of purchase. They claimed legal compliance prevents them from helping me. It's amazing they can bend the warranty rule but not the proof of purchase rule. My proof is I have the player in the original packaging. Buyer beware...."
3,The Hot Christmas Item,"My son received one of these cats for his birthday in early November. He loves it very much (because he loves all cats)and especially enjoys brushing the hair. However, it is definitely not what it is advertised as. His sensors do not always work and it is definitely not the ""real"" thing at all. I agree with the other reviews that portray this cat as not being all it was cracked up to be. It often takes it awhile to wake up and move and it does not make life like moves. Why are we all rushing the stores for this? I guess only the toy makers know that secret."
1,"Disappointed : no fun, want my money back !","hi !i bought this toy for my 7 year old daughter....and she does not even look at it. to begin with, the cat is poorly made...it does not resemble a real one...its got some rough patches over it...as if its caught some disease...ours is a black one...so it looks UGLY ! WORSE...THIS CREATURE TAKES AGES TO MOVE AND RESPOND. the sounds generated are so LOW that it does not matter whether its hussing or purring, everything sounds the same :-( the tail movements and the neck movements ARE ABRUPT,...the sensory points are not clear. ...soemtimes the tail moves much after you pull it !it was such a dissappointment...and the thing cost me [money]!i really wish i could give this piece back and get my money to get something better for her !I WONT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY.thanks"
2,Kind of dull,"I bought this stuffed, noisy cat for my three year old son as an alternative to him keeping after my two actual cats for affection. First of all, it is not cuddly at all, as I expected. It only does a few things, it moves its head to the left or right, purrs, meows, and arches its back a little. Although I am not totally disappointed, as it is kind of cute, I still can not figure out why these things are all the rage. If I had tested one out prior to purchase, I think I probably would not have bought it."
4,both kids like it,"My daughter got this for her 7th birthday, but my son who is 5 also loves it. He calls it his cat, since our real cat is hers. It is a great toy, and I often do double-takes because I think it is real!"
3,not worth the money,"This product was definately not worth the money. It seems no matter how you pet this cat it hisses. I have yet to see the cat move in some of the ways advertised. My daughter played with this cat for about an hour before she lost interest in it after begging for it for the two months prior to christmas. It now is just another one of the many ""had to have"" toys that end up a room decoration."
3,Was expecting more,"To be honest I was expecting more on this book.It didnt tell all the info I wanted to know and the author focus too much on 2D games like Everquest and not so much in 3D games like Second Life.In most of the book the author is a little superficial in his analysis,he could go deeper.However the book is good for people who wanna have a general idea about on line games,specially Everquest,World of Warcraft and Star Wars."
5,Quicker salads for good nutrition,"I love shredded carrots, beets, broccoli stems and maybe throw in a dozen wholealmonds. The Universal Slicer/Shredder makes this easier than any appliance I'veever tried. The ingredients taste fresher than those in the ""salad-pak"" typeproducts available. It's an investment I think will pay off."
1,Avoid this poorly designed contour gage.,I took a chance on this contour gauge because my old one with the wire fingers rusted and fingers fell out. This gage has fingers that won't rust and won't fall out. The problem is that the fingers are too thick for a good contour copy and they are so loose that they won't hold the contour in any position but horizontal. I was extremely disappointed in M-D Building Products Contour Gauge. I don't recommend this product at all.
4,I love it so far!,"I bought this MP3 player from eBay for about $68 bucks. I love it! It's much smaller than I thought. It's light and easy to use. I bought it because of the scheduled FM recording which works great. I didn't have the best signal at first, but when I put it farther away from my body it gets a better signal."
4,"Great Product. Lot of features. Great Sound, but firmware problems","Love my unit.. Great sound. Full of features. FM Radio picks up great. Would have given it a 5 star but I'm not able to get the new firmware (1.70) to update. Followed direction to a ""T"" and I'm somewhat of a computer geek but I can't get it to update and this doing it step/step w/direction per instructions provided on their website. Format & rebooting didn't help. Maybe someone can pass along a tip to updating firmware."
1,ITS TOO EARLY TO BUY THIS PROTOTYPE MP3 player,"Once the software developers have de-bugged the Iriver interface with the Media player 11, it may well be an excellent device. Until such time, what you have is an FM player. When you try to play anything you have down-loaded , you will find yourself viewing the error message ' To play this track you must sync your device to your PC'. It's quite disappointing, so much promise; my rating, not ready for prime time."
2,"eh, just ok","this cd has some ok songs on here but nothing that grabs you at all. ""wake up"" is a total pink floyd rip off (pink floyd suck enough in the first place). the lyrics are real blah. chris just repeats the same thing many times in a song. i like all their cds and eps a lot besides this one. if you want to discover some good new living end music, track down their b sides."
4,Classic.,"Definitely Puppy's most unique album, if not their best. Still, its style and tone have yet to be matched in the years since. Last Rights is a noisy, chaotic album, full of death and decay, with Nivek Ogre's tortured, fractured voice permeating through... still, moments of beauty abound, like rays of light shining through the twisted human wreckage. Also don't forget the classic 11-minute experimental track ""Download"". Unfortunately missing from this album is track 10, ""Left Hand Shake"", which simply must be heard if possible, as it's one of the best tracks (not) on the album."
1,Worked Great for over a Year...,"I've had this machine for well over a year and have had no problems with it until now. In fact, I was quite pleased with it (considering it was so inexpensive). It had some limitations (takes a bit of a while to load discs compared to some other machines, making it take a longer to be able to record a program), but these are probably due to it being an older generation machine anyway. The machine had been working very solidly, no real complaints.But now it will not longer read ANY discs at all. It will not read blank, previously recorded, or even commercial discs."
5,Best of the Best!,"Ken has appeared in several comedy videos. ""A Wimpy Prophet,"" is actually a sermon but not like any sermon you've ever heard. Lots of side splitting humor, fantastic insights and the best in inspiration. I love all of his comedy and preaching videos but this one is my favorite (although Super Sheep isn't far behind). Keep them coming Ken. We need your fresh approach. You prove what Drs. are now finding out...laughter is good for you. For your body or your soul, this video is a great prescription."
4,Illustrated Bonsai,"The author has made this book easy for the beginner and experienced grower alike. Clear instructions with great pictoral directions in sequence. A good reference book on growing bonsai, bonsai styles, pruning, tools and soils."
5,what fun!,My friends and I laughed ourselves silly at this. Anita is such a delight that you can't go wrong with any of her stuff.
4,Humor Just for Ladies,"This video had some really funny moments. Along with the funny, came some not so funny. I am a Christian lady who enjoys good, Christian entertainment. This video was, for the most part, clean entertainment. I did find it a little weird when the comedian tried to interject serious, spiritual moments throughout her routine. I'm all for spiritual moments, but she didn't execute this well. I enjoyed watching this with a few of my girlfriends; however, some of the content is just for ladies. Overall, it was a good choice in comedy."
5,Yasmien's the best!,"I love the song ""In The Name of Love"" and ""Enjoy and Ride"". These two are my favorites. Get this CD and you'll be delighted! Pechay of California."
3,"All Time Great Movie Themes, Ferrante & Teicher",Content very entertaining and wonderful...sound quality terrible!
5,great music to live by,"this was a pleasure to listen to and the younger generation did not complain about listening!!!!the day was sultry, there was a breeze and the iced tea went great with the music.old songsbrought back memories and gave my grandchildren new ones of being lazy with grandma!!!!"
2,Not for those that loves foam,This toothpaste wont generate foams as regular toothpaste so it's actually very hard to expose them to your teeth to the largest extend. Your teeth ended up not in much contact with the toothpaste to fully get the benefit from it.
5,Can't beat it.,"Tastes good, works pretty well and has no bad (i.e.; toxic) chemicals in it. We have a environmental health clinic and this is what we recommend for chemically intolerant or sensitive patients."
2,Not the best,"For all the huge Blur fans, like myself, this cd has to be the worst out of them all. The songs get boring, and it isn't easy to differentiate one song from the next. This is one of those cds that you'd buy and find only one good song on: ""There's No Other Way"""
5,Great Shave,"This razor and blade combo has given me,and will continue to give the best shaving performances in over 40 years of shaving. Add to that the fact that it is built like a tank and you have an unbeatable combo. Thanks Merkur!!!"
1,Broke!,I have bought 3 of these and within 2 months they had all went completely dead. First the picture went out and then the sound. I ended up throwing them away because I had no receipt or packaging.
5,this is the best visor I have used for soldering,"I use the visor for detail work with soldering parts onto circuit boards. You know the ""usual"" visors, they fit like a halo around your whole head. you have to tighten it like a vise to keep it there. AND if you have bangs and pull your hair back when wearing, then you have the hassle of getting that halo arranged around your hair and it quite a hassle, and then if you need to see ""normally"", then you are pushing the visor up on your head and the whole hair arrangement thing starts over.This visor solves all that. It is very lightweight and stays where you put it. You wear it like a head band, for lack of a better description, and the magnifiers rotate down or up easily. This way, it has absolutely nothing to do with your hair and is very comfortable.I have been wishing for something like this for quite some time and I am very pleased with my purchase."
2,A highly anticipated Disappointment!!,"I was soo excited to get this book from reading Laurinda Browns ""walk Like A Man"". However, after reading the first few chapters i realized i was set up for a disappointment.. The book spends the first like 150 pages just on background. By the end of the book i knew not only chris and gail's life story by their mother's, father's, cousin's and the rest of the family background too.. There simply was not enough story line on what the story was supposedly about. I couldnt figure out what i was just reading all the drama that went on with the main characters at the end with Chris talking to a shrink.. Everything she told the shrink should have been more apart of the actual book.. I was just bored to peices and really still looking for the plot by the end of this book. However, allthough this review is not about part II which is ""Undercover"", i must say that book was soo much better. A much needed relief after dragging myself through Fire and Brimstone.."
4,Tropical Aquarium Fishes,"This book is good but published in 1990. It replaced my old Exotic Aquarium Fish, Innis published 1954. Axelrod has beautiful pictures, information on tanks, feeding, cleaning, heaters, filters, etc. Much has changed in recent years and some equipment and care information needs modification. As a definitive guide the book is great when used with advice from the pet store. Be sure to find the fish expert if the pet store is a National Chain, or go to a special Aquarium shop or small local pet store that has Aquarium fish.ETRDenver"
3,okay book,"I can see why this book won awards...kind of. It's alright. My kids are NOT totally into it (ages 4 and 7) and never really were. But, it's fun on occasion. The pictures are kind of cool. The story is alright. There are definitely better books out there."
5,The world's most popular spa resource guide,"From the moment you receive your copy of Spas - The International Spa guide, you know you've entered the blissful universe of health, fitness and lngevity spas. All the information you need in right here in this book. Do something good for your health, body and soul. Get your copy of Spas - The International Spa Guide now!"
5,A Family Favorite Film,"A wonderful cast, superb story and fabulous talent make this tale of a Texas dysfunctional family a favorite. Fore grown-ups must return to the family home as their father lays dying. One religious lady, one lying olde maid, one nasty and mean cuss,, one fat wife, one feisty mother-in-law, one singin' floosy and a hippie with a fat joint rounds out this family. All-star casting makes this one a keeper! Watch as they all uncover each others secrets while hunting for ""Daddy's will""... After all, he's dyin'."
5,America: A Narrative History,"This is one of the very best American History books available. It is detailed but not laborious. Tindal and Shi include all the critical issues of American History but also add information that makes reading very interesting. I also recommend the companion reader for college instructors, high school teachers and the rest of us nerds who just like to read about history."
5,Latest purchase,"The book was sent to me in excellent shape, much better than described. I am very pleased with my recent purchase."
4,Solid all the way through,"""I'm the Only One"" is a bit corny, but fun nevertheless. The rest is mostly outstanding, with irresistable music and compelling lyrics. Her willingness to offend the sexuality police is refreshing and admirable."
3,Femme fatale.,"End of summer is really the story of two peoples affection for each other, but the plot can stir up emotions in those of us who are over jealous, as the two people almost by misunderstanding, doesnt get each other. And (so it can seem) tries to make each other jealous by ""adultry"". The film also contains other emotional stiring situations, as young girl trying to commit suicide since they got pregnant with the priest etc, -excuse my english I havent slept in 22 hours."
1,Absolutely Terrible,What a terrible design. There is just no support for your bust. It looks pretty on the photo but not in reality. Also bad quality. I threw it away!
2,220 Volts AC (European voltage) burned it out. OK for USA 110 VAC,"Worked fine for charging on US 100 voltage. But when I took it on a European vacation, after a few charges on 220 voltage, the light turned red and it would not charge anymore. Testing back in the US with alternate cords and different iPods confirmed the charger doesn't work when connected to an iPod. Disappointing."
4,One happy pup!,"The bed arrived quickly and as described. I don't know why, but based on the other reviews, I was expecting the bed to be HUGE. It's not. It's perfect. My 45lb boxer/border collie mix fits with a bit of room to stretch out, but the bed doesn't take up a ton of space like I worried it might. The colors are neutral enough not to be an eye sore. My doggie loves it and lounges against the elevated sides. It seems like it will hold up well, but we'll see with time. I am a little worried about cleaning it though..."
5,Well received bed,"The dog I bought the bed for won't get in it, but the other two love it. I think she doesn't use it because it is a bit difficult for her to get out of it. She is a senior dog. The bed seems well made and is light weight. I haven't tried washing it yet, but it should wash and dry easily. I consider it a good value for the money."
4,"I like it, but...","The bed looks nice and feels great, but unfortunately I'm not the one for whom the bed is meant. Barnum simply won't get into it. I wonder if it's because it doesn't sit flat on the floor, so it felt wobbly when he tried it. With time (and use) it may sit flat and feel more stable. I may have to convince Bailey, our other one, to use it some. Then Barnum will get jealous and claim his bed."
4,Dog uses it,"My dog uses this, but the poofiness of the stuffing still keeps her from using the whole bed. She's got one side of it kind of tamped down, and that is what she sleeps on. However, we've noticed that she is slowly working her way to the other side. The bed arrived in the promised condition. You'd think she'd have taken right to it, given her arthritis. I actually tried it out, much to my dog's dismay. There was shaking of the collar and barking right in my face! Then, she took over the bed when I got up; it is hers! (If the cat is annoyed with her, the cat sleeps in the middle of the bed, and the dog goes elsewhere!)"
3,Good Dog Bed; Could be More Practical,"We ordered the 40"" Bagel Donut bed (black sherpa). Here is my feedback.Overall: The bed is fine. The cons wouldn't keep me from getting it again, I just expected more for the price I paid.Cons:1. Who in their right mind makes the bottom of a dog bed white? Gets dirty very easy!2. The cover cannot be removed, so washing it is a pain (you have to try and fit the entire thing in an oversized washer)3. The stuffing in the bottom gets clumpy and looses its shape4. The 40"" bed is not that huge. My dog is 30lbs and I cannot imagine a dog larger than that using this bed.Pros:1. My dog loves the sides of the bed. It allows her to rest her head on it.2. The sherpa bed bottom is very soft"
4,Donut bed,Purchased as Christmas gift for German short-haired 4-month puppy. The dog likes it so much my son cannot get him out of it in the evening! Not sure about ease of cleaning it but is great bed!
5,Dogs love it.,Bought this to replace a similar bed that was old and well chewed. We have two German Shepherds and a hound mix all about the same size. They are still trying to determine who gets the new bed even though the two GSD's have larger beds of their own.Bed is well made and appears to be very durable. Company was quick to ship and had excellent communication.
4,Worth it,"We have a 60 lb. Hound/German Shepard puppy who fits very nicely in this bed, there's even room for him to keep his toys in it with him. The size and weight make it easy to deter the pupster from chewing it up too easily (which had been the case with his last three beds). This is a good dog bed, if he should ever grow out of this one in the future I'd probably order a darker color to replace it."
4,Good Tight Disc,"The Ohio Players were the real deal back in the day.as Writers,Arrangers,Producers,Musicians,VOcalists&Image Makers the Players had their own thang.The Music was always tight.SUGARFOOT&Crew give up the GOODS here.You Can't put a Category on their music.it's Good Solid Music that deserves to be heard.I Miss The days of SELF-CONTAINED UNITS."
4,They were Part of When Music Was Good,I was just trying to replace some of the music that I had lost over the years. The CD was in good shape and I am enjoying listening.
1,Sticky!,Trying to find an aluminum free deodorant? Don't try this one. It made my underarms sticky. After an hour I couldn't stand it and had to wash it off.
2,Long lasting...yea I don't think so,"I have sensitive skin and regular deodorant makes me break out so I started using Adidas aluminum free deodorant which worked really well. Eventually though I couldn't find it in the store anymore, I guess they stopped selling it. So I started using toms and I thought it smelled pretty decent but it doesn't work! Like, at all. I put it on and literally a minute later I'm sweating and the deodorant it starting to smell really...I don't know how to describe it but it's just weird. Not weird in a good way either. My advice is use it if you want to but not if you sweat a lot like I do or if you're about to do something where you know you're going to get really sweaty because if you try to go to the club and dance or something while wearing toms then trust me you're gonna be pretty ripe in about 30 minutes so just wear regular deodorant. So basically only wear toms in the winter time when you're doing absolutely nothing. Then it works. I guess."
5,D.L. Moody's Secret,"Next to his conversion and his marriage, the pivotal point in Moody's life was his baptism in the Holy Spirit. From that point on, the Holy Spirit's ministry in the life of believers was a constant theme in every element of his work. This book presents the core of Moody's teachings on the baptism of the Spirit and the role of the Spirit in the life and ministry of the believer."
3,An OK B-Movie,"This is movie starts with our ""hero"" crash landing on a planet populated only by women. It seems that the men were all so stupid that they all died in a mining accident. The women now run things and the one and only city on this planet is like the old west. Needless to say, plot is non-existant. Women are decent looking though, and nudity is fairly frequent. If you're looking for a few minor laughs and some good looking women taking their clothes off and wondering what the old west was like without men, than this is the video for you. The 3 Stars are strictly for the women."
3,Just Not Enough,"There just was not enough attention to detail in the writing or crisp editing, or directing in this film. A waste of talent, essentially."
5,The power of unconditional Love,Buy this book. Read this book. The cental point is that everyone must have someone who believes in them no matter what. This book will entertain all and change some. An instant CLASSIC.
5,Happy Husband,"I bought this as a christmas present for my husband, his original CD was stolen, so he was very happy to receive it. Great value for price."
2,Music is O.K. ---- Lyrics are a joke,"Well, what can you say about Thin Lizzy? They had a few hits back in the 70's, they were somewhat original, but they were always excluded from any serious discussion of rock music. Ever wonder why? Because they didn't deserve much mention! Their music is good and solid, I see no problem there. But their lyrics are trite and self-impressed. I guess what I am trying to say is, unless you are a real fan of Thin Lizzy, don't buy their music. Folks, it ain't all that great."
4,says only TWO phrases,"my three year old son is barely starting his STAR WARS education. he kept falling asleep on top of his action figures. OUCH i thought, so I figured this would be a great alternative...A SOFT VADER!!! now, the first shipment NEVER got to me but amazon replaced lickity split. my son LOVED it. it does get very annoying as vader only says one phrase...the other sound it makes is his legendary breathing. it is a wrestling buddy toy so it has a weird look to it but my son loved it nonetheless. these things are flying off shelves locally!"
3,"it works, but not quite as promised","I can see that the device has 7 USB ports, as advertised. But the two ports on top don't work -- the connection isn't reliably snug -- and these are the ports I'd use the most if I was plugging and unplugging things in a lot. The 5 ports on the side work fine, though."
1,FAIL,I bought this to extend the ports on my Mac but it proved entirely unstable. Plugged in devices would constantly loose power or in the case of non-powered devices they would have to be unplugged and plugged back in to be seen. Ultimately I installed a PCIe card with 3 usb and 2 firewire ports which is what I should have done in the first place.
3,Cheap looking..... but gets the job done,"My first impression of this hub is the cheap looking molding of the case. For a $50 msrp hub, I would expect a more solid and robust design. The features though are as described and everything seems to work fine.Also, being a powered hub, I made the assumption that I could charge my usb devices while the computer is off. That is not the case. Apparently, most hubs don't have that feature. When power is not being sent via the usb downstream port, it will not power up regardless of whether it is plugged in or not. To me this is a dealbreaker, so I ended up returning it and getting a Targus hub instead."
1,Unreliable,"I own two of these hubs. The one attached to my main, tower computer fails repeatedly. Whenever I insert a flash drive, nothing happens. I have to unplug the USB cable to/from the computer, and reinsert the cable. The flash drive usually starts up when I reinsert it.The hub attached to my laptop is powered by the AC adapter. Periodically, the wireless transceiver to my keyboard quits working. I have to unplug the transceiver, unplug the hub from the laptop. Then, reconnect everything. (The wireless transceiver works fine when it is connected directly to a port on the laptop.) The hub also fails on other occasions when I connect a flash drive. The devices disconnect briefly, then reactivate/reconnect. This happens with only two or three other devices attached. Belkin always had quality products, and this hub has a high-powered AC adapter (3.5-3.8A); however, this particular hub continues to fail."
4,Better than it seems.,"My exposure to Adam Copeland (better known as The Edge) comes from the Syfy series Haven, so when I learned of this movie, I had to get it.I was not disappointed, Adam is utterly charming. Even that was his first acting gig, you can't help but fall for the man. His true personality bleeds through and wins you over. Seriously, the first five minutes had me laughing and praising my purchase.The movie was hilarious and fun. Jamie Kennedy will always do a fine job and he and Adam were a perfect pair. It's now my guilty pleasure movie."
2,Very predictable,"Kind of a silly movie, predictable but okay to watch when you are tired and you don't want to have to think!!!"
1,Bad Services Seller,"I bought some pens cross this provider at $30.94, but they canceled the order and notified me that they were wrong about the price, which seems to me that it is false advertising. so tell them not to buy from this vendor.also you can deceive.DRCross Classic Century, Medalist Ballpoint Pen and .07mm Pencil Set, Polished Chrome with 23 Karat Gold Plated Appointments (330105)"
4,GI in WWII,Important and majestic book regarding all material and items used by GI in WWII; extremely important for beginning collectors and modellers.
3,OK--pretty good Christian action novel,"My sister-in-law recommended this author to me. She is a fan of mysteries and also said that she appreciated the way Christian decision-making was integrated into the story. I like mysteries and am not usually a fan of Christian fiction, but I tried this, and I will say it is a pleasant, quick read, with pleasant characters. The plot holds together well, and the main character, a retired cop working as a security guard in a theme park, does deal with Christian ethical issues in a human way-not at all seeing himself as being above others or being above what he perceives to be temptation.I'm not sure I will read more from this series, but I am glad I gave it a try. Christian fiction readers will enjoy it!"
1,Too Preachy,"I'm sorry, but this book was too preachy...and I go to church every Sunday. When the dad wishes all his children to be missionaries, when the book calls all Mormons evil, when non-believers are called heathens, etc. It just gets too judgmental and intolerant, it totally turned me off. The kids are so scared to do anything wrong and are so unrealistically ""good"". It was not my kinda book...ICK!!!"
3,Its okay,Here is a wealthy family trying to figure out what to do for others for christmas. It is a good storyline but very hard to relate to in this struggling economy. The rest of their days are filled with parties and sleigh rides another element hard to relate to.
4,"Easy to install, clear instructions, good packaging","While there's not a lot to review here, Westinghouse delivers an inexpensive and well-assembled light for use in dry outdoor areas. The instructions are clear, the mounting materials fit within existing standards, and the construction is durable for its expected use. From opening the box to finished, I had the fixture installed in 10 minutes. The finish is well applied so I don't have to worry about the rust spots that collected on the previous brass fixture. I would recommend this product based on price and simplicity for a simple porch light."
2,op's are losing it,angel's tight but when you hear this you can tell op is losing it by now o.h.i.o is tight but still the fire is slowly burning out.
5,A roadmap to friendship with God,"Although this book uses the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius, and is filled with helpful guidelines for an eight-week prayer guide, the impact is much greater than it would seem on the surface. I found it more than just acquiring knowledge about God but a way to intimacy with God through His Son, Jesus Christ. Although it is very comprehensive in its methodology, it allows for flexibilty in its use. We are all different. Therefore each of us will have a slightly different relationship with God. The book encourages each of us to find our unique spiritual path, using the exercises as guidelines. I highly recommend it."
5,Ideal for more advanced projects in school or scouts. Also teaches diversity,"This is one of those craft books ideal for the Boy or Girl Scout troop leader. The designs are very detailed and they all require a great deal of effort to complete. The projects are from all over the world and they are:*) The European Diamond Kite*) The Japanese Red Devil Swooper Kite*) The Oriental Butterfly Kite*) The Korean Warrior Kite*) The Chinese Yuan Kite*) The Guatemalan Sun Kite*) The Traditional Chinese Dragonfly Kite*) The New England Ghost Kite*) The High-tech Box KiteThere is a scaled grid drawing of each of the kites and detailed textual instructions regarding the materials to use as well as how to put the kites together. Several diagrams showing intermediate stages in the kite construction are also included for each model. I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in young people creating advanced kite models, independent of the reasons for wanting to do so."
5,A Classic! Pure and Simple!,"Truly one of the best movies I have ever seen! It was breathtakingly beautiful. Not only the looks (which were by far the best Pixar has dished out) but also emotionally. I'll start with the star: WALL*E. He was THE most adorable thing I have seen. From the way he moved to the way he ""talked"". He oozed cuteness. WAAAALLEE! And then there was the relationship between WALL*E and EVE. I have seldom seen a more true relationship, even in humans. I think I speak for most when I say that I was a little teary at some parts, whether it be story related or from it's visual beauty. However, the movie is not just sun shine and rainbows. It has a very strong message, present throughout most of the movie that really unnerved me. This future is very possible. However, only Pixar could suceed in not turning it into the preachy film it so easily could have been. The perfect movie! Way to go Pixar! 10 out of 10"
2,Movie plays good. Bonus material get stuck.,"I bough it for my kid as she keeps getting it from library to watch over and over again. I went with used so i don't have spend $40 + on it.I'm going to keep as the Movie plays good. Bonus material get stuck. Looks like I have to do some work to clean derbies or get any scratches out of the disc if i can.I expected the case or the disc to look worn out but for $20 paid, content should have played fine."
1,Pixar has been co-opted by Hollywood sameness,"I am just about ready to give up on Pixar. Go back and look at the depth of the stories in Toy Story or Bug's life--the humor and the grand themes. The last 3-4 Pixar offerings are straight out of the worst of Hollywood conformity and unoriginality. Are people confusing great animation with great stories? Wall E was maudlin, predictable and Cars rewritten. Boy, car, or male robot is lost--female of same type helps him find his way or himself. Pixar has run out of good ideas, and maybe even ideas. They are currently at the point where they need a new direction, having used most of the usual environments, space, ocean, nature, imagination, and industry. They could try fantasy next. Whatever they do, they need to get rid of the tired formula that has taken them from ""infinity and beyond"" to mediocrity and the bank."
1,Boring and Repulsive -,"WALL-E is another beautifully animated Pixar Movie, but a dark boring first half, and barely interesting ending. This, along with no early dialogue, left the movie with the oomph of a pile of tin cans and meandering trash heaps. The film's artwork of a futuristic world is well depicted, but WALL-E is alone on the earth and he cannot sustain interest. Later on, he meets a girl robot, and love blooms - just beeps and squeaks throughout. Much of it reminded me of a silent film with Charlie Chaplin. Having a cockroach as a friend was repulsive, not cute.Earth has become a garbage heap with a cloud of toxic smog. Us fat humans have escaped, sent to outer space in a Space Ship that looks like a gigantic Caribbean Cruise ship. All they do is eat and float around in deck chairs. This is in the last half of the movie and the simple message is overdone. The movie had a couple of smiles but the wait for something interesting to happen is tedious."
1,poor,the DVD arrived. but the package was damaged. Is a Christmas gift. and I send the package back once because it was damaged. the same DVD. I see that doing DVD's with amazon may not be a good thing. No time to send it back before Christmas. May send it back anyway.
1,Bad service,"Don't take this as a rating for the movie but for the service on buying the movie.I ordered the BD version of this film amazon changed the order without consent, and took over half the payment on return/exchange, so now I have to pay more than before. Never ordering from amazon again."
4,Good movie,"I had never seen this movie, but friends recommended it. So I purchased it and just watched it for the first time.The movie was great. It was funny, and touching. There is a message in the movie about the damage we are doing to the planet. Sometimes I felt the message was over-done, but at other times it was perfect.I don't want to give away the story. My recommendation is to watch the movie and enjoy it. You can enjoy the movie without being wrapped up in the message. Or you can watch it with kids and talk about the message. Either way you should enjoy this light hearted movie."
5,Hello! It's Wall-E!¡!¡!,Wall-E is a wonderful movie for children and adults alike! The picture is great on my kindle fire and its nice for on the road. Makes my son and I smile every time! :-)
4,Ta-Daaa....,"I liked this movie. It's one of the better Pixar releases. It was very entertaining almost all the way through. The story drifted 2/3 of the way in the movie, but it was still fun to watch. Wall-e is a lovable robot and both children and adults will enjoy watching him. My review is on the single-disc edition."
3,Typical Pixar...Nothing Stands Out,"If you want to enjoy a nice evening with your kids while they learn how we will one day destroy the Earth, and how we will all turn into boneless fat pigs living in space while robots take care of us...Then this movie is for you. The premise of Wall-E is a little off the mark, but should serve its purpose in an entertain aspect for children. This film is full of humor and plot points typical of other Pixar films. The animation is top notch as always, but I would like to see a Pixar film that displays human characters as realistic as possible and not as rounded cartoons. Overall, not much to say about the film, good or bad, but it will remain worth watching for many families."
4,One of Pixar's BEST!!,"The first half of the film is almost without dialogue, the latter, less artistic half compliments it to become one of Pixar's best films to date."
4,Cute Movie,"This movie is funny, but very sad in the fact that the storyline could actually be a reality some day in the future. Kids love it, and it's even worth watching if you don't have kids."
1,"Good Movie, Flawed Product","Don't get me wrong, I love the Wall-E movie. In fact, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. However, it is with this 'Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)' that I have issues. Now please note that although I am in Australia, I have bought dozens of DVDs from Amazon, 100% of which I have been able to view without problems on my computer, using either Power DVD or Windows Media Player. This Wall-E 3 Disc Edition, however, will not run at all on my computer, not on Power DVD or Windows Media Player. All it does is cycle through all the chapters in a few seconds, and then returns to the menu. To add injury to insult, Disc 3, the digital copy of the movie, when I type in the redemption code, mocks me by saying that I don't live in the USA, so my registration is invalid. I am not aware of any such warning mentioned in the sales blurb. Conclusion: good movie, completely flawed product. The only part that worked was the Disc 2, the extras. Hmm, helpful..."
1,Beware if outside the USA,We purchased a BluRay player on the basis that BluRay discs are not regional. Most are not but the option to include it exists. Disney seems to be the company that uses it. The sales information did not mention the regional code. It is region A which we cannot play on our non-USA player.
4,Great movie....,"Although the condition of the case was a little worn when it arrived, the disc was in perfect condition. By far, it has become one of my favorite disney pixar films of all time."
5,"WALL-E, WHERE ARE WE?","THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR, BUT SURELY NOT THE BEST BLU-RAY OF THE YEAR, THE WHOLE QUALITY OF THE VIDEO BECAME A LITTLE OVER-EXPOSED, BUT THE VIDEO BEHIND THE SCENES BECAME OF MUCH FUN, I THINK."
5,Wall-E hugs your heart,When I was watching this movie. It was hard to hold back the tears. Wall-E definitely gets my vote for best animated movie of all time. I found it remarkable that I could tear up and care for this movie and its characters like that. The messages (ie the environment and love) sent in the movie werent too preachy and overally dramatic. This movie is proof that you can express emotion without many words. I would definitely watch this movie again. It is a timeless masterpiece
2,Only in English,"The article is in English only. It would be interesting to register if they are in English, French and Spanish. Despite doing this Article was in perfect condition and the fast shipping is very great. Thank you!!!"
5,"Good the first time, then a little boring","In my opinion, it is not worth the money to buy this DVD, unless you don't mind paying for something you only use once. My kids were dying to see this movie. I bought the DVD hoping it would provide hours of enjoyment for them. They liked watching it the first time, and each time I have tried to turn it on after that, they don't give it any attention. Cute movie, just a little boring the second, third etc.. time around.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
1,GOOD MOVIE DONT WASTE $ for DIGITAL COPY,"You wont receive the code and unless you kept EVERYTHING from purchase you wont be able to get the code. I bought mine from amazon, did not get a code EMAILED the company SIX MONTHS ago and still have heard nothing. I just googled and found software to do it for me. So now i have WALL-e on my ipod. SAVE YOUR MONEY and just buy the movie, or if there is a 2 disc set get that, DONT bother with the DIGITAL copy. First you wont get the code, SECOND if you did get the code its useless after a year.FYI the movie is WONDERFUL and its a MUST HAVE, but the rest of it, is just too much of a PIA to bother with. I would have rather saved my money and just bought the regular movie."
5,One of our family favorites,This is one of our families favorites. We went to see this is theaters. A must have for ever family. Beautifully done. .
5,Pixar's best.,"Maybe the best pixar movie to date, running close to the incredibles, if buying this is a question of whether the movie is good or not, there is no question. As far as the features the 3 discs include, they are pretty neat, good for anyone interested in animation or the process. Also includes a hour and a half long history of pixar, which is great. Goes in depth about the upcoming of pixar, great for anyone who is interested. I loved this package, I'm a big fan of pixar's movies but this one is above and beyond. BurnE is also included, another short on top of the already amazing Presto, great stuff!!"
2,SHORT CIRCUIT 2? OR 3????,"MOST ADULTS AND KIDS LIKE THIS MOVIE. YES I LIKE THE SONG FROM PETER G... THE MESSAGE OF THE MOVIE IS OK, AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT BUT...THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A DIRECT RIP-OFF OF #5 FROM SHORT CIRCUIT. I GUESS IT CAN BE CONSIDERED A SEQUEL OF SORTS"
4,Great!,"My kids just loved the movie! my daughter took it with her everywhere. She watched it at home, in her room, even in the car. She's seen it at least twenty times."
4,"Very good, but not great movie","Personally, the first 20 minutes without dialogue were the most engaging, creative, and humorous. Once the story hit space, it became quite prosaic, with much of the activities and dialogue onboard being straight out of other stories, and nonetheless with several logical holes, even for a kid's movie. The return to earth was strictly formulaic and feel good as well. Despite this, still a respectable, sweet, and humorous tale."
1,the box was badly damaged,"i bought it under the confidence that vary good condition was not that the box was so smashed that to even look at the disk i had to bend the box to get it out, I will say the disk works fine and seems in good condition but i am still mad about the cast"
5,Wall-E,"This is such a great movie....frightening that this might be our fate in a decade or two! The DVD didn't work on my player all the way through, but neither did the one I borrowed from my son. I assume it's my player, not the DVD, but I sure would like to know why it gets stuck in the very same place on both DVDs!! I'll have to do some investigating."
3,Wall-E,"We can tell we're out of the ""kid stage"" with this video. Way over our heads. But the underlying theme of love/relationships was quite sweet. I'm sure kids will love it."
1,Terrible message in movie,"Wall E starts out fine but in the second half a message that is dangerous and just wrong comes across. The message is that fat people are lazy and stupid. Every human character in this movie is grossly obese and lazy. They stay in recliner chairs that hover and move around so they don't have to. They are so lazy, they don't even eat their food, they drink it instead. Then they are portrayed as dumber than dirt when their captain tells them they can grow pizza plants on earth. They are so excited to grow pizza plants, they wobble and waddle out of their chairs to follow the captain. It is sickening and untrue. If Pixar or Disney showed a race of people the way they show fat people the movie would be banned."
2,Did we watch the same film?,I don't understand these 5 star ratings. Why was this film made? I won't go into details and rip this piece to shreds. My family has watched Monster's Inc. over a dozen times. Same for The Incredibles. I just watched this movie after buying it for the kids for Christmas. I won't watch it again! Guess what? My kids have not seen it since the first and only viewing the day after Christmas. Enough said!
3,"Great Movie, Horrible Packaging","While the movie itself gets a 10 out of 5 stars rating, the ""green"" packaging for this atrocity brings the overall review down to a 3. Both my copy and a friends copy were ruined over time simply from being taken out and being put back in. If you buy this, make sure to replace the packaging with your own"
3,Wall-E,"I had expected more action, it was rather boring but the kids probably would like it, great animation."
3,so so,"It's bit overwhelming. It is going to take me a long time to go through it, even though it is a thiny book. I would say that whole chapters are basically one question posed in many ways. I can totally see my boyfriend running away from me if I ask him all 1001 questions ;) I guess next time I should go for 10 questions that you have to ask before committing."
2,"""eh""","This one was alright, it had more of a cuban beat than a crack-smoken old school Eek-A-Mouse. I liked it, ""Love Me"" is a good song. Its alright, but I like his others a little better."
4,Real Review for Fake Songs,"This CD is a good CD. Liam is a funny dude and a natural songwriter. I'm not going to give you a track by track rundown, but overall, the songs are funny and enjoyable. I will say I love the fake Bjork song. Buy this CD if you're a Sifl and Olly fan, if you really liked the School of Rock songs or if you really enjoyed the Tenacious D movie songs. Buy it if you just want a goofy CD. A lot of the songs are from the show and the new ones are reminiscent of the show. The ones that don't fit into those categories are funny parodies. The rest are crap!! No, just kidding.Oh and the DVD is a cool look into Liam's life. You really get a good feel about how he does things. He has some cats. He's very inspiring, I almost got up and tried to make a cool puppet character out of various items in my room."
5,Awesome,"I first heard the liam lynch song &quot;whatever&quot; on the tony hawk commercial. But since i work at Target, I bought the cd. What an amazing deal. 15 songs, plus a free dvd with it, thats.... awesome!!"
1,worst textbook ever,"Many of UC Berkeley professors use this book because Kittel was an influencial professor here before he retired. But at Berkeley, many of the professors themselves know this is a BAD book. I am taking a physics course which uses this book. My classmates and I think this is the worst textbook we have ever read. This book doesn't explain things in clear fasion. Many of my classmates have stopped reading this for the class. This book has so many errors and sloppy notations. This uses the same letters for different things. Sometimes s is a state label, and sometimes spin. M is sometimes magnetization, other times mass. And on and on! This is a very confusing book. I highly recommend NOT to use this. Also, many of my classmates' book are falling apart even though they just bought new ones. very bad book."
5,Decker is Awesome,"I've never been to Utah, but I feel like I have after reading Rod Decker's incredible book! Every character leaped of the page, and the ending had me talking to my friends for months. I hope Decker will favor us with a new book soon."
2,Disappointed,"This book is for music students -- as in term papers -- not as a source for researchers writing novels about musicians. In the beginning of the book, the author says, in essence, that it's nearly impossible to describe music. Then what did I waste $28 for?"
2,"Great sound, terrible user interface","I bought this unit mainly for its voice recorder feature, very handy if I want to record myself dyuring music class. As other reviewers have already confirmed, the sound quality on playback is very good, and given that it it it has a mono built-in microphone, recorded sounds also sound good. Also useful at the expense of greater thickness, is its use of AAA batteries.The bad is the user interface. The buttons are divided above and below the screen, and depending on how you hold the device, the feature you want is accessed either from the top or from the bottom. Not that accessing the feature is always intuitive, in the beginning I was forever having to re-read the manual to understand how to use it. The iPod this is not."
1,piece of junk,"I have a different iriver, the ifp 899 which was apparently made before iriver decided to save money every possible way they could, in order to maximize their profits. the T30 costs almost the same as the 899, but has all the worthwhile features taken out. You have hardly any control over the quality of the recording you make, way less ability to navigate--you name it and it is NOT in this machine. Not only that, but after a few months of VERY light use, it started making corrupt recordings which makes it a huge hassle to load them onto my computer and compress them. Plus, recorded files are ENORMOUS unless you use the ""low"" quality recording setting--and then their quality is rotten"
4,Nice player if you upgrade the firmware,"This was one of the first 1GB flash players that supported subscription music services.When I initially purchased this player, I disliked it. It wouldn't play OverDrive audio books (32kbps), and does not sort files well. I tried the early firmware upgrades, and they did not fix the audio book problem. However, the recent upgrades now support lower-quality audio, AND firmware 1.71 supports Audible.I don't mind the default MTP (Media Transfer Protocol). It was frustrating at first, but if you use playlists as documented in the user guide, MTP works fine. If you don't like it, you can now switch to UMS (USB Mass Storage) which allows you to use the T30 like an external hard drive.One thing that still really annoys me is the battery cover. It falls off all the time."
2,"Too thin, too ""smooshy""","I only weigh 150 lbs and after sitting on this cushion on my office chair for an hour or so, it is like sitting on nothing. The memory foam does not even have enough strength to hold me up - it just smooshes down to 1/2"" thick and essentially leaves me on no cushion at all. I will say that it feels great when you first sit on it, but it is basically worthless after the foam compacts down (which happens very rapidly). I wish I had not bought it."
3,slight disappointment,"The picture shows two pieces but ony one seat shipped. It does say seat cushion, singular"
1,Not even remotely close to what is pictured!,I am not at all impressed with the color quality of this paper. It's not even remotely close to what is pictured! It's more of a hot pink color rather than the rich red color that is pictured!
3,hmmmm...,"This book is fine, a pretty hum-drum outfit like any other 'teach yourself' book. It's pretty good. However, I'm writing this review to let people know that the 'handwriting units' are utterly useless, unless you actually wanted to learn an incomplete alphabet in a childish scrawl. Also, the printed nasta'liq is very tiny, spidery and hard to read. If you have no previous knowledge of Arabic or a derived script, I cannot imagine how you will manage.I recommend 'Urdu Grammar' by Ruth Laila Schmidt."
2,Looks good but it fried my motherboard,"This hub fried my motherboard when I first plugged it in. On a good note, I needed to buy a new laptop anyway :)"
2,Quirky Compared To 4-Port Hub,"This Belkin 7-Port Hub is quirky --- sometines failing to recognize and/or handle certain devices. Since these same devices work fine with the Belkin 4-Port Hub, I'm rather disappointed."
1,Just Up and Died!,"This hub worked fine for about 9 months. It's a hub. I don't expect much from it. Just sit there, do your job, and don't cause problems.Well, this one was unable to hold up its end of the bargain. Several weeks ago the hub stopped responding. No warning signs, and no apparent hope for resurrection. I've tried it all. I've hooked it up to other computers to try to trick it into 'resetting' itself. I've tried leaving it unhooked for extended periods of time hoping it would magically come back to life.Nothing worked. Now I have a lovely, expensive paperweight.Don't buy."
4,Works like a USB hub should,Works like a USB hub should work. The thing that makes this one stand out to me is the different options. (Options in a USB hub? Yep) It has the two ports on top that make for quick easy access. It also has the side hook-catch thingy that holds your cables on the desk. Mine has my iPhone cable and my headphone extender. It's a nice little feature that is a huge bonus if you plan to use it. It is also kind of a dark white color which matches my Apple products.Great buy!
3,Great while it lasted,Almost 4 years old before it died.Items that were plugged into it stopped working and the hub got extremely hot!!!!Now I have to find a replacement fast. : (
2,"was nice until it up and died, we'll see how the replacement goes","So the design is pleasant, it has a solid feel to it. BUT one day it up and died. Tried it on multiple machines, multiple ports. It's dead. My other hubs are fine, thank you.I'm disappointed with the reliability. Am doing an RMA now, for the price of shipping ($5) since it's past the Amazon limit, so we'll see how that goes."
1,Good looking but ...,"I liked this product as soon as I had installed it. I think it's well organized and attractive. Everything was going great until I started hearing a high-pitched buzz in the air. At first I thought it was my monitor, then slowly, by unplugging one thing after the other from my power bar, I discovered it was this pesky little hub. After Googling this, I discovered others have had a similar experience with Belkin hubs (see Apple Store). It's annoying enough for me to return. Very disappointing."
2,Just OK,"The picture on the fan was nice, however, be careful not to touch it as the paint/colors rub off easily and leave giant colorless/see-through spots on it. Also, it stated on the website that there is a silk loop on the back for ""easy wall mounting"". There was no loop. I contacted the seller and they said that the website had a mistake and they would fix the misinformation, and I should just nail it to the wall. I would not have purchased it if I had known that."
5,Another fabulous performance by Page,"As in her portrayal of Alma in Tennessee Williams' ""Summer and Smoke,"" Geraldine Page is electrifying, recreating the role she originated on Broadway. This time, however, she has a leading man worthy of her talents. Paul Newman proves he has more than his looks to rely on; it is to his credit that Page never overshadows him in their extended scenes together. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. The film itself strays from Williams' stage version (which included such topics as venereal disease and castration) in several respects, but also has some intriguing additions, especially the scene between Ed Begley and Madeleine Sherwood. But the real reason to watch this film is for Geraldine Page -- what an actress. She is missed."
4,"This is that ""Video Soul"" era of music","I remember this album, which is one of his best albums, second to 1999's Back at One. ""Way Love Goes"", ""One Last Cry"" and ""After The Love"" were the singles and the standouts on the albums. Everything else is great too, except for the hip-hop/R&B remake of Hall and Oates' ""I Can't Go For That"", which made me say just that. But this is the perfect album to play for those romantic evenings with your mate."
1,Panaceas from Ambiguity,"The shallow in search of the superficial requires no better example than this thankfully brief tome. It is an excellent companion to ""It Takes a Village"" in its pseudo-intellectual banalities."
5,love this book!,great book for christains! i have the movie so its a good book and has a good movie. i thimk alot of peple should get this! always write a good review!
4,"a ""kitchen sink"" scare flic","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I'm a fan of (but not zealous towards) Argento's movies, but really prefer horror to slasher, so this one hit me just right. Every possible creep shtick is utilized; it's both very effective and embraceable. I found myself nodding in appreciation while still being creeped out---the director knows how to pull it off, even with a lower budget than most slasher films use. Great fun, play this one as part of a halloween mini film-fest!"
2,Great Voice.......................Bad CD,A Friend of Judy GarlandJudy's Voice on this cd is FANTASIC (as uasual) but the sound quality leaves alot to be desired. What elese can I say about a CD?P.S. I only gave it 2 stars because of the product not the singer!
1,The book is awsome. The tape is abridged crap.,Raptor Red is a great book. See my review from 6/97. The audio tape concentrates only on the passages that deal with Raptor Red herself. The vivid picture that Bakker painted is lost in the merchandising. Skip it and buy the book.
2,Ho Hum,"Sorry, but Bob's book, ""Dinosaur Heresies,"" is his best work to date and shows his great artwork and wonderful theories. Raptor Red is a bunch of fiction without dialog about an animal with a pea brain (Smarter than a brontosaur but dumber than a house cat). It drags and is best suited for curing insomnia. Buy his other book and be entertained."
5,In the claws of the raptor--a new look at dinosaurian life,"Robert Bakker writes a great novel. It's amazing how he can tell a story with just thoughts and descriptions, and make you believe the characters. He gives you his opinion first hand on dinosaur life, but at the same time tells a good story. His dinosaurs are not lumbering ferocious giants, but real, almost sentient creatures, an role which dinosaurs--especially carnivores--have not filled very often. The story itself is well written. Raptor Red is taken through various terrains and hardships, and even emotional conflicts, such as the friction between her consort and sister; through a flood, a drought, and a near-death experience with a deinonychus pack. There is also humor in the novel, and even some small pop culture referneces in the narritive. In short, a well-written, entertaining book, and great for dinophiles."
5,WAY COOL!!,"Raptor Red was a cool book. The characters were well thought out, the story itself was cool, butI have one question. Why was Raptor Red's sister always harassing her mate? Is she possessed?"
2,blase dinosaur book,not a great read. not horrible rather repetitive.no comparison to jurassaic park
5,Good Read,This is a very well written book that gives the reader a new perspective on life. There are technical details but they are implanted well into the story and do not break up the flow. I would recommend this for children 12 and older.
5,Loved It,But Why on earth would you expect someone to pay 100$ bucks for it? I dont love any Book that much. sheesh.Now if it was priced for its normal value then you bet ya id buy it again.
5,"I laughed, I cryed, I killed and ate an Astrodon!","Here's this little novel I never heard about popping up out of nowhere. A novel about a Raptor written by THE Dr. Bob Backer?The story follows the titular Raptor Red in her often tragic, harsh Raptor life. But the book keeps things light with all these asides about 'the mother of all crocodiles' and 'how a turtle views the world.' It's also filled with interesting behaviors and events of the distant past.I'd heartily recommend this book to all Dinosaur lovers, and I'd force it on those who don't.(Funny thing this book was written before they'd figured out about the whole Raptors have feathers thing, but I still imagined them with feathers. Couldn't help it!)"
4,Nike Kids' Triax Junior Watch,"This watch is an amazing watch: It tells the time, of course, date, and day of the week, plus it can be used as a timer. It is very useful, just a bit confusing to find how to change the time. But all in all, it is a rewarding item to use on a daily basis."
5,Stunning,"This is quite one of the most profound books ever written.I mean it. You cannot go through life, in my opinion, not having read this book. Whether you're interested in spirituality or not, this book is simply a must.It convinced me to commit to a regular zazen practice, and simply cannot be recommended highly enough.Captivating."
2,Pass this one by,"I like most of Poul Anderson's work, but he missed it on this one. The story line is good, but the dialog was so syrupy and fake that I couldn't finish it...and my wife couldn't stand it either...try something else."
2,can be much better,"this is a tiring dvd to watch. I have tried 3 times to watch it from beginning to end and not successful. there are just too many flat 2d video effect moving / floating / fade in-out in front of the screen which does not compliment nor match the architecture of H&deM. The tone, colour, ambience and aura are not there. At least we have the architects talking, but the editing is not so good either. The pace and mood is simply not there. Makes me think that reading any good publication on the architects (try the good publishers) is a better experience of the time and space and texture and colour and sensuality the architecture provokes. Is there anybody who can pick up the job to redo a good film on this?"
4,"Terribly Literary, but haunting nonetheless","Henderson joins the ranks of Jim Grimsley, et al, who write in the self-conscious literary style of the immediate present tense; rather than showing the reader what happened, such writers show the reader what IS happening. In a sense this literary device makes reading Native like entering a dream, and at times what is happening is unclear, as dreams are vague and disquieting. But still, I grew to like Blue as he discovers himself and his relationship with Sam, though I was disturbed when Blue just leaves Sam to live or die without explanation--like dreams. --Ronald L. Donaghe, author of Common Sons"
1,You never get the rebate back,"Don't trust the company. You can always see rebate from its products, but you will never get the rebate. Amazon really should remove products from the company."
3,Good and bad,"Well-researched and foot-noted, with fine step-by-step detail which allows the reader to appreciate the drama that unfolded. BUT, dozens if not hundreds of typos, misspellings, and punctuation errors -- on virtually every page. Mr. Liddic should review the proper use of the comma -- unbelievably bad. All such errors make for a distracting read and could have easily been avoided through even a casual editing process. Very disappointing in that way."
1,TOO RIDICULOUS FOR WORDS,"This author has presented a battle scenario which is so absurd, it is absolutely too ridiculous to be described. It is, perhaps, the worst presentation of the actions at the battle in the modern era. Avoid at all costs, especially at the current price."
4,"I think it's excellent, if you want something simple and fun :)","I've played this game for Nintendo GameCube before, and loved every minute of it! Only reason I'm not giving five stars though, is because of the slow AI. I can set it to hard, and run away with the win easy. It has a little bit of an arcade feel to it, so don't bother with this if you like more simulation in your racing games, you would be better off with RalliSport Challenge 2. If you want a simple, yet fun rally racing game that has a bit of realism to it, it's worth a try."
2,disappointed with the seller,The alarm itself works fine but not exactly what i wanted. i am very dissappointed with the seller. i ordered the pyle pwd501 and i recieved the pyle pwd401. a completely different alarm so i ended up paying the better alarm and getting the smaller model one.
2,Don't bother,Please. Please consider spending the extra money and purchase a security system worth the installation trouble.Cons:Round trip between transmitter and computer is ridiculous.Transmitter has frequency issues in terms of interference.Pros:pending....
5,Very Useful,"I hated to pay twice as much for shipping as the item costs, but could not find one locally. This simple adapter allows me to use my standard threaded-tip extension pole (made for paint rollers) with a window scrubber, squeegee, and cobweb duster. Easy to put on and holds tools securely. I ordered mine from Toolbox Supply and it was delivered in about five days."
4,Great College Movie,"Club Dread isn't for everyone. I think it's hilarious and fun but the humor is very ""frat boy."" The jokes are usually sexual and the movie has some very bloody parts to it but I would recommend it for anyone who is a Jimmy Buffett fan or if you like Brittany Daniels. The humor is crude but some will enjoy it immensely. The nudity is gratuitous but that's what you get with this style of humor. In all, I liked the movie."
4,A good sense of humor,"People bashed this movie but It is a good movie. One thing about The broken Lizard team who created this movie is sometimes they have a dry and subtle sense of humor. At first the movie is ok, but when you watch it and recognize the little nuances in acting or the dialogue, its hilarious. These guys write movies not for people to just veg out and hope for an awesome plot. Its made for people who understand the comedic genius and humor behind the movie, and the little things which people who have a sense of humor will understand, or appreciate. Watch it more than once and you wil appreciate it."
2,...not what I expected,"First of all, make no mistake that these guys are entertaining and hilarious, and if marketed more towards the horror end, I would have given this movie a better rating. THIS MOVIE MAY NOT BE TO THE LIKING OF A SUPER TROOPERS FAN. This is essentially a slasher movie with a sense of humor, NOT a comedy with some gore. The killings are more reminiscent of I Know What You Did Last Summer, and it almost overpowers the feeling that you are watching a Broken Lizard movie. I wouldn't have been so disappointed by it, had everything I had heard about it was more accurate I suppose. If you like these guys, RENT IT!"
5,Trying to keep my excitement under wraps!!,"Super Troopers... Amazing. My favorite movie genre is comedy, and I love a lot of comedy movies; for instance, Dumb and Dumber, Zoolander, Me Myself & Irene, just to name a few. From the moment I saw Super Troopers, the others just fell into second place. Broken Lizard, the team behind this madness, are true genius comedians. What makes them so great though, is there ability to translate this comedy in to a film.With all of that being said, Club Dread promises to carry on the tradition of outrageously funny comedy... we can only all hope and pray that it is!"
2,These Guys Made Super Troopers?,"I disliked this movie almost as much I loved Super Troopers. Not sure if I would say it was awful, but it came close."
4,Stoner rock at its finest,"If you are a fan of early DOWN, Sasquatch, The Sword or even Monster Magnet then you will like COC. You have probably heard Congratulations Song or maybe even Doublewide before. You might have even heard Who's Got the Fire or Over Me in your favorite biker bar. Good sound, decent lyrics and beat."
4,This was hard to put down!,"This is a historical fiction book. While there is some correct historical information about the aleuts the characters developed are fictional.The chapters alternate between the main character Brandy in the 1980s and some aleutian women from the 1700s. When the viewpoint is switched, some important historical information is given to help pain the backdrop.There are many journeys in this book and I'm not talking about road trips. Spiritual journeys are frequently mentioned and they pull you in even deeper to the plots.As I was reading this book, I was debating whether to recommend it to my book club. It's an interesting tale and told a unique way, but I'm still on the fence about it."
5,True to Alaska,"Well done. The Alaskan Attitude is captured perfectly, and I laughed out loud at a few of the descriptions. I've recommended it a to a few friends already.."
4,a far away place,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this book - I'd heard it was good, but it just didn't sound like it would draw me in. Once I started it though, I found it very difficult to put down. Brandy's character reminded me in many ways of my younger self. The chapters that travel back in time to tell the stories of the Aleut women were really interesting - this is a place and people I was totally unfamiliar with before. Brandy's descriptions of the Aleuts' intense connection with their home of fire and water, on the edge of the world made me want to experience that too. I really liked the thread of women gaining strength and independence living in this difficult land."
5,Live life to its fullest,Teresa is an amazing and courageous woman. Her book isuplifting and inspirational. Her life before and afterher diagnosis of MS was well written and I found I had tofinish reading it even though I had already started aJohn Grisham novel. She has lived her life well andfully. I recommend Life is an Adventure to anyone--whether disabled or not.
5,Wonderful,"My (...) grandaughter just loved finding a book all about herself. She is most assuredly a""fancy Nancy"". I gave it to her with her very own hot pink boa ! She just loves the story and the illustrations."
5,Every little girl's dream,"My girls loved reading this book and having it read to them. The illustrations are wonderful and playful. The story is long enough but not too wordy. We have to put it away for a short while every now and then. When it is discovered again, the story delights my girls. Recommended for ages 4 and up."
5,Excellant book for little girls,"I bought this book for my grand daughter who is five years old and enjoys being read to. She absolutely loves it! Her mother checked out several of the other books in the Fancy Nancy series from our local library, but this is the first one that she actually owns and can keep by her bed for night time reading. Thanks Robin Glasser for all the fun."
3,Words were small and difficult to read on a Kindle,My 3 year old granddaughter seemed somewhat interested in it although it was difficult for me to read as the words were faint and small. Illustrations were good.
5,Mother & daughter time,"My daughter loves when i read these books to her. We have almost the entire collection, shes fascinated by all the colors on the pages. Definitely worth the price! Shipped sooner than expected which is always great!!"
5,"Stupendous, That's fancy for Great",I bought this for my toddler because she was already showing all the signs of fanciness. It quickly became one of her favorite books. So I had to get a copy for my niece who is also fancy. Great way to grow a little one's vocab and encourage their own personality to develop.
5,fresh air,This product really works. Eliminates stale ordors from refrigerators. It is samall & compact. A great price too
5,"Strong, durable case for the PSP Original","The best case hands down for the PSP original. The cutouts for the buttons do not affect the feel of them at all, in fact, you barely even notice there is a case surrounding the buttons (I know the pictures are a little deceiving). Clear, durable plastic encases the entire PSP, leaving openings for the game slot in back, it even has a build in stand that you can use when the PSP is not in use, or if you're watching movies/tv shows. Unfortunately you have to take the case off the PSP to access the memory card slot, but how often would you really need to open that anyway? My only gripe with this case is the fact that being it is clear plastic, it is prone to light scratches. Besides that only cosmetic flaw, this case is highly recommended if you still own the original PSP and need a great case."
3,Easy to make,"This book, (and their twin), it is an excellent example of scale model in paper. In their pages are parts press-out of the ship . It's not easy for little children, but, it's excellent to share a time with them. The leaves separate with ease and should be glue according to the instructions. Care with the marks of the fingers!. An entertainment for family . (Idem to Make Your Own Klingon Battle Cruiser)"
1,horrible,"I bought this video for my second grade class. They were completely bored and could not pay attention. It is simply coloring book pages set to audio of a woman who is reading a text much too quickly, and on a much higher level than any small child could comprehend."
5,One of the best software books I've ever read,"This book is very abstract - so don't expect a ""How do develop software using XYZ methodology"" when you start reading. However it gives words to vague notions that any experienced software developer probably already has and puts you in a good position to evaluate what kind of techniques would work well on what kinds of projects.It's an excellent overview of what developing software is actually all about and the various things that can infulence that very complex process either for the better or worse."
2,Not funny,"Okay, I ""get it"", but only because I'm a white, middle-class, college-educated, PRIVILEGED woman. It's kind of ""cute"", but not something I find myself going to time and time again for a humorous release. If you like to feel smart, smug, and highbrow, then you'll probably get a kick out of this little book."
1,Waste of money,What a waste these things didn't work or make it any better to slide with. The kids had a much better time on the slide without them.
3,3-d fighting,"the game itself is a solid fighter true to the series. there are some lack of polish on the whole, but the game remains playable. if you are a die-hard fighting fan, then this game may be a worthwhile pursuit. however, if you are new to the genre you may want to look elsewhere. i do recommend this title, albeit not resoundingly, as there are better games out for the xbox."
5,This CD is awesome!,"I LOVE this CD. I had never really listened to the Wallflowers before someone gave me this CD as a gift, but I listen to them all the time now. The song ""Health and Happiness"" is one of the greatest songs I have ever heard."
1,I feel like I am taking crazy pills!!!,"OK, let me say that I own every Wallflowers album. I have given a five star rating to every single one of them except this one, which I give a one star rating to. Imagine my shock when I open up the reviews and see so many five star ratings. Hey, that is cool, to each their own, but I don't get it. This album seems sappy and desperate to appeal commercially. I hate to use the phrase ""sell-out,"" but I have to. The word cheesy comes to mind on many songs. I actually felt embarassed listening to some. This is nowhere close to Rebel Heart or Breach or BDTH, not even in the same ballpark. I listen to those albums weekly, this one I took to the used record store (where I bought it) and sold it back. Great band, but this album is really bad, in my opinion. Still a great band and if you like it, more power to you."
5,Wagan Brite-Nite review,"Just a short review on this flashligh lantern combo. I had an old Coleman similar to this one for years and years, but it finally died on me. This is, so far, a very good replacement for it. The light is good and it is not too heavy or bulky. I have only had it about a month so far but I am happy with the purchase. I would recomend this item."
2,So horrid an ending to the series - why write it at all,"I have loved all the other books in both the Talent and the Pegasus series, but this is by far the worst book of Anne McCaffrey's that I have ever read. Anne McCaffrey should have taken the time to write a ending to this series worthy of her own talents. Personally I had hoped for many more book's in this series, but this is such a horrible conclusion to the series I almost cried.For me there was no real closing of lose ends, not convincing closings anyway. Characters are flat and unconvincing, to many new ones introduced and not developed, old ones changed past recognition - no sign of the love and layers Anne McCaffrey usually pours into her characters. A multitude of new plot line possibilities introduced, not to be developed.To me this book seemed as if Anne McCaffrey just wanted this series to be over and done with, so that her fans could'nt pester her for more books in the Talent universe."
3,A Medium Rate Conclusion to a series,"While I greatly enjoyed the first 4 books in this series, this the 5th book is rather slow. Its almost as if it was written to finish off a contract or just to give the author another book out there. Don't get me wrong the writting is fine and all, but the storyline is rather flatline. Nothing really exciting or dangerous happens, we just observe a lot of politics, family interaction and fleet movements. All in all I'd say this book can be safely skipped, barrowed from the library or purchased if you really want to complete the series."
1,"I am a faithfull Mccaffrey reader, but this book is awful.","I have been engrossed in the lives of Anne McCaffery's various characters since I first read Dragon Song at the age of twelve. Fortunately, The Tower and the Hive is not the first book by her that I have read. The book lacks any sense of a cohesive plot and is filled with tedious narratives...I am not sure why I even bothered to finish the entire book!"
4,Needs another book,"I liked the fast pace for a change. However, a lot of loose ends and typos as others have mentioned. Something should have been done to move the captured queen from the moon base to her own home. Need a another book on contact and talking to the hivers. Maybe a spinoff series. Need more Talent tales along with brain ships."
3,A lackluster finale to an excellent series,"The fact that the synopsis lists Afra as Damia's brother should have tipped me off to the mediocrity of this last (hopefully not) book in the Talents series. I felt that more loose ends were left at the end of this book, then at the end of Lyon's Pride. At least 1/4 of the novel is poor rehashing of the previous novels, and is simply not necessary. Although some interesting plot twists develop, and some more character exploration is done, it seems like this was pushed to publish simply because of deadlines, and not because it was a complete novel. Speaking as a chemistry PhD student, the whole portable GC thing is not plausible, by any stretch of the imagination.All together, not a strong finish for my favorite Anne McCafferey series"
2,Only reviewing this specific dvd,"I just watched this movie for the first time at home on the specific dvd sold at this site...It is listed at 92 minutes, which is accurate by my measure also. However, the film, according to other sources was originally 106 minutes. So, if you buy this be aware that 14 minutes have been cut from the original movie at some point in the sales ""pipeline."" Thus I will only give this two stars, which is probably generous considering how much was cut."
3,final fantasy origins final fantasy 1 and 2,"the game is super fun, if you like to explore and find the different cities and places in this world."
4,great games although lacking the dungeons from the dawn of souls version,"i bought this because i wanted to play ff2 on the huge tv screen(it requires alot of grinding which i love, but on a small screen canget rough on the eyes)i didnt get to the extra board on dawn of souls ff2 for ds (didnt even play ff2 on that)but the extra boards on ff1 for ds are absolutely outstanding.i remember being ENCHANTED playing the extra ff1 dungeons.for these reasons i recommend either depending on what you want. good stuff :)"
3,Here's Your Chance!,"If you don't have either FF1 or FF2, now is your chance to get them, and both on the same disc. It's more of a collectors item, because you might think it's boring and think the graphics are awful, but remember that these games were made more than ten years ago. However, if you like the Pokemon games, you might not find a problem with Origins, cause they're basically the same. These games are really a challenge."
5,"Great buy, jump on it!","I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan and I'm proud to say that this game is a great beginning to the entire series! Though it is enhanced for the gamers of today who can't go without better graphics or enhancements, it is at the very least a must-play. I think it is better than Anthology because it is faster. Anthology was slow in going in the menu and saving, whereas Origins is very fast. I also like the difficulty settings (easy & normal). It enhances the challenge of the game. Overall, this is a game everyone should play at least once and a must for RPG and adventure fans!"
5,Greatness Renewed,"Final Fantasy Origins not only changed graphics and gameplay, but made the games more enjoyable. Both games; Final Fantasy & Final Fantasy II are even better recreated. Kudos to Squaresoft."
1,"Oh Square, where did you go wrong???","Okay, let me start by saying I'm the biggest FF fan in the world. No question. But this game was like all old and {edited} and stuff. Nothing near the greatness that is FINAL FANTASY 7. The graphics are all terrible, nothing like FF7's. Did they think us super fans wouldn't notice how terrible this was if they just put two terrible games in the package? Shame on you Square. I don't know how I'm ever going to forgive you..."
1,Bought the same $60. bracelet at Walmart for $20.,This store is a rip-off. I bought the same bracelet for my son for $20. at WALMART. I paid $60. at this store.
2,Works... barely,"One of the software installers won't work on win7. The other does, but crashes a lot. I'm running it under winxp mode (google it). They need to update the software."
5,Item Does Not Work With Window 7,"I Had to return this item because it did not work with Windows 7 I should have read the specs My Fault. . The company contacted me and let me know that it was not compatible. I thought that was a very nice way to do business.I returned it and all is well, I would deal with them again."
4,Pretty Neat for FREE songs!!,"I was a bit skeptical about this item. After installing the software, the program ""snaptunes"" allows you to listen to your local radio stations. It also has an option to record a station for a certain period of time. Once the recording is finished, it will show a list of songs that it recorded. I'm assuming because its free, it doesn't always know all the song info. But you have the option of typing it in (if you know it). Right click on the song and you can import it to itunes!Sure you might hear a little snippet from a commercial, but come on its free music! If you don't want to hear that then you're better off buying the song."
5,Awesome!,"We bought this item as a birthday gift for our son. He absolutely loves it. He says that it is easy to work with and has worked great for him. I was a little concerned because some of the reviews were not very positive, but he is very happy with it."
3,from the dumpster to our dvd players,astro zobies...sounds like a more promising plan 9 from outer space. it's not much better actually. my buddy nabbed this dvd used for real cheap and we had a good time trashing it. probably not something i'd wanna see again though. i remember alot of the movie being padded out. one grueling scene had some chick looking around terrified in a shoddy lab room for what felt like an hour! just form the openning credits you know you're in trouble. i'm still not sure if the marching wind-up toy robots were supposed to be actuall robots or not.worth a look for bad movie buffs
1,Warninig: Vendors Sending UN-Revised and UN-Updated Edition,"I have now ordered this book twice that is listed as the UPDATED AND REVISED 5TH EDTITION and have received the old Edition with an Anatomy CD that works on Windows 2000 or XP computers and not Vista/Windows 7. Beware, I do not know why the vendors are sending out the old edition even though they have it listed as the UPDATED AND REVISED EDITION. I would not have been so aware I had the Unrevised/Unupdated Edition until I tried to run the Anatomy DVD in my computer. Sounds like a very good book if I could get the correct one. BEWARE."
4,"Muscles: Testing and Function (Kendall, Muscles)",It was nice to have the postural information in the same book as the tests. I'm an older therapist and it is nice to have a good book.
1,PROMOTES BACTERIAL RESISTANCE!!,"These are NOT the usual Purell sanitizing products - as their main ingredient is benzethonium chloride, they promote resistance. This is how we get ""super germs."" Use the other Purell products - the ones that contain alcohol, not benzethonium chloride."
5,The Best Advice,I bought this book as a recommendation from a friend who had breastfed all of her four children. This was the best advice I have gotten thus far! The book is easy to read and very informative. The material is captivating and inspiring. The book has made me feel confident as a woman and a soon-to-be-mom that I can feed my child naturally. I am passing this book along to any expectant mother! The best book I have read so far!
5,WONDERFUL book,"This is the only breastfeeding book you need. When my son was born, I thought I was totally prepared to breastfeed him, but right away I had SO many questions and concerns. Most of the time, I just looked in this book and found all the information I needed. And when the answers werent in the book, I just called my local La Leche League leader, and spoke with her (phone number even provided in the book!).If you want to give your child the best start in life by breastfeeding, prepare yourself by reading this wonderful book!"
5,Nursing 101. Great information.,"This book will answer just about any question you may have regarding nursing, and has other useful information as well. I had a very hard time nursing, and found the La Leche League, this book, and a lot of hard work got me through the first couple of months. The ""What to Expect the First Year"", was a good book to read whether or not you nurse. This book is definately written for the breastfeeding mother, though I have referred to it for other things (fever, introducing solids, co-sleeping)."
3,Good if things are going well...,"I have to agree with some of the reviews that I've read. This is a very informative and pro-breastfeeding book. I bought it when I was pregnant with my daughter and, having read it, felt very prepared to nurse her. However, we had nothing but challenges for the first 3 months. I found myself frequently turning to other sources for help and information. This book is a great resource for successful nursing relationships. But when I had to supplement with formula and introduce a bottle earlier than I wanted, this book made me feel as if we were in an unusual situation (now I know that many women have trouble nursing) and that I was somehow damaging my beautiful daughter by feeding her formula."
2,some good info but too dogmatic,"There is definitely good information to be found in this book. However, it is wrapped up in a lot of preaching and dogmatism about breastfeeding. LLL is a great organization, but it does sometimes tend towards the radical when it comes to promoting breastfeeding. The book is too optimistic, making women believe they will be able to breastfeed without too much trouble, and that breastfeeding is amazingly convenient and all-around wonderful. This is just not realistic. I am extremely pro-breastfeeding, but the truth is that some women do have significant trouble, and a small minority will not be able to breastfeed. This book seems to demean those women. I also think the book has a bit too much extra judgemental ""advice"" on parenting and working as a mother (this is referring to a previous edition, not the 7th, so I don't know what's been changed).If you're looking for an excellent book on breastfeeding, I highly recommend Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding."
2,Not realistic...,"My mother-in-law bought me this book and I started reading it the first time I was pregnant and it turned me off of breastfeeding from the start. It assumes that all women are able to quit working and stay at home with their children, therefore being able to breastfeed exclusively. It looks down on women who may need to give their baby a bottle because they are going back to work. I work full time and plan to return to work after maternity leave, I was looking for more of a book to help me understand what I can do to continue doing what's best for my child, this book is way to preachy."
4,Great Book for all Moms!,"This book is a must-have for new moms or anyone interested in learning more about breastfeeding. My only (minor) complaint is that it leans rather heavily on the advice of one Dr., who is admittedly regarded as one of the top experts in the field. I wish that it had included more scientific data and a wider variety of experts instead of so many personal stories.I love how the book grows with you-I keep finding myself returning to it as my son gets older and we go through different stages of our nursing relationship. Definitely a great book to buy for yourself or as a shower gift for a new mom."
4,This Game is Great! Only one thing wrong.....,No 2 player!!!!!!!!! It would have been so sweet to play army men with your friends!!!! To take your armys and battle!!!! That would have been soooo coool :(
5,a cruddy print,"Well, I'm halfway decent at French, so when I buy big French classics like this the first thing I take a gander at is the subtitle situation. Here, only English is possible, not French or any other language. There are also no dubs into other languages.Fortunately, however, while the letters of the subtitles are white, the letters sport tiny black borders, allowing them to remain legible even when they appear against a whitish backdrop, such as snow or a bridal dress.Why doesn't everybody just make yellow subtitles? Sheesh!Anyhow. The extras are lame: you get to see a gallery of posters for the film and a bevy of still shots.In short, what you're gettng is essentially the movie in DVD format, but nothing more worth mentioning. Don't be led into thinking this is a revolutionary transfer or anything. I can't see how anyone could feel that way."
5,Ear Candy,"I use Kretschmer Wheatgerm in my homemade granola regularly. Excellent.HOWEVER. Absolutely the finest thing about this product has got to be the sound of opening a brand new jar!In our family, several of us will stop what we are doing and gather in the kitchen to hear the breaking of the vacuum seal. MMMMM! Ear Candy!Another great way to eat it: Slice a banana half, and then the slices lengthwise. Spread each piece with banana, sprinkle with Kretschmer wheat germ, and add a few raisins on top.Kretschmer's can also be sprinkled on a toddler's banana pieces. Helps them hold on to them!"
1,Great Disappointment,"I ordered this so I would have some extra support while sleeping and lounging around the house. I am currently (because of nursing) a 40DD and this bra just does not work. While the material is soft it doesn't fit snugly, the straps are WAY too wide and constantly slide off my shoulders and I pop out of the front when I lay down. All in all, it was a waste of 10 bucks and I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Runs Small to Size,I had to return this item because it runs small to size. Order a bit larger. The material is comfortable.
2,Not for large breasts,This bra does not work for small women with large breasts. I am normally a 40D but now a 42DD at 7 months pregnant and can't find anything that fits right! The straps are too wide and won't stay on my shoulders and there isn't enough material to keep anything in place.
4,Comfortable,I didn't like this at first because I was to large to open it the right way (from the side) but then I started just pulling it up over my breast and now I love it. It needs to be a bit tight to give any support but there are no spots to pinch and the shoulders are nice and wide. I find myself wearing it as much as possible. I think for the price it is a good buy.
3,"Good, but don't trust their floating ability","I really have nothing to compare them too, but they worked pretty good. The top tends to dig into my foot, so I'd definitely get booties. Also, I'd get leashes, so you don't lose them. Don't trust that they'll always float. In calm water they float, but I was taking them off near shore and a wave took one under and it never came up."
1,They Don't Float!,"Despite their claim, these don't float, and that's the only reason I bought these. Lost one the first time I went out and I'm still peeved."
5,Richie the Great!,"I enjoyed the entire CD. Richie Sambora is not only a talented musician, but a soulful songwriter and singer. Listen to the samples and you will certainly want to add ""Stranger In This Town"" to your collection."
4,Richie is just as good alone,"While best known for his jammin licks in the band Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora holds his own this solo album. Full of grit and soul."
3,chronium steel,"Now Iam finding paper which is about 2.25cr-1mo steel. so, this is very helpful for me ."
1,Warning - Extremely Bad Directions,"I bought this book because I thought, while flipping through it at the store, that it listed lots of interesting sites. But when I got home I did a quick read-through of area I'm familiar with and discovered these authors know nothing about correct directions or facts.For example, I found a listing for a covered bridge in Pennsylvania that I used to live next to. Armed only with this book, no one will ever find it. That's because it's about two miles west of it's listed location and it's on a completely different road. Not to mention there are no signs to aide lost tourists.Then there's the mention that the Appalachian trail runs through the Catskills in New York ""from Pennsylvania to Vermont"". While anyone with an atlas can see it goes nowhere near the Catskills on its way from New Jersey to Connecticut. Did these people even visit these sites in person?I wish I had read more of this book before I bought it and wasted my money."
1,"Don't get it for the poetry, or for the history","It's hard to believe this book is still in print. The history was already outdated when the book was first published, and the translations are sometimes wildly inaccurate.Bogin's book has been superseded by ""Songs of the Women Troubadours,"" by Matilda Bruckner, Laurie Shepard, and Sarah White (NY: Garland, 2000), which has an excellent introduction and translations that are both accurate and readable."
2,"""Ignorance is no excuse""","I first read Ms. Bogin's small book 25 years ago, and valued it for the translations, mostly made by Frederick Goldin. Her ""knowledge"" is a tissue of myths, extreme prejudices, and confusion. My favorite: ""The doctrine of Immaculate Conception, which made the Virgin Mary herself the child of a virgin birth, was an ingenious way of sparing Jesus Christ the indignation of having to pass through a contaminated mother. As a second generation virgin, Mary presumably was free of the curse of Eve."" (11) Mary is conceived by normal sexual intercourse between her parents, but by anticipation she does not have original sin. Having never read Steven Runciman or a dozen other scholars on the Cathars/Gnostics/Manichees, she presents them as ""pacifists and vegetarians"" (58), which would greatly amuse the Cathars! Far from seeing women as ""equal,"" they particularly deplored women, who by giving birth served evil. But the Goldin translations and the illustrations are very attractive."
3,snow pants,I had a fair experience with this seller. they did arrive on time and were as expected. my son has yet to wear them though so i can't review the warmth of the pants.
4,Minimum leg length 32.5 inches,"The first thing I saw when the box was delivered was ""Minimum leg length 32.5 inches for this bicycle."" I wish they had put that in the product description. As it is, it is a little tall for me. It is a nice bike for the money though. Assembly is pretty easy. Most of the screws are hex head. They are nice to work with. You will need metric Allen wrenches or better yet, Allen wrench sockets that fit your torque wrench. The rear of the bike comes assembled, including the derailleur. You have to install seats, handlebars and the front wheel. It is about 95"" overall, once assembled. I also ordered the ""Avenir Cruiser Fender Set,Chrome, 26 Inch"". They are a pain to install, but I believe they will fit, after some grinding and drilling. It makes a pretty cruiser. It is also the only bike I found that interested my wife in tandem riding."
1,Not worth it.,"This bike came without the handlebar for the back passenger. After calling the company 4 times I finally was told that they did not have the part and they did not know when they would. I was told to call back every month to check. It has been 3 months, no handlebar."
5,Poorly written User Manual,"It looks like they used a manual for a standard bike and just added the word ""Tandem"" to the top of it. Which makes assembly a little more difficult since the instructions don't match the bike.Mine also arrived damaged and with some missing parts."
4,Error!,"Otto Winter is not the actual organist!The real organist is MIKLOS SPANYI of Hungary.He made the recording in 1987 and sold it to a german record producer. That record producer sold Spanyi's recording to several labels. Such as Point, Madacy, etc.Some cds say Otto Winter at a Silbermann Organ.Inactuality it is Miklos Spanyi at the Calvary Chuch in Szombathely, Hungary. The organ was built by the Eule Orgelbou of Germany.Mr. Spanyi himself emailed this information to me.Otto Winter is not an organist at all."
4,this cd is jammin,"this cd is hot, turk doing his thang, (free turk)... overall the cd is a nice cd with hella tight beats. it has a few album fillers which is why is put 4 stars instead of five, but buy it, you'll get your money worth and sum."
5,Outstanding.,"Very good book. Well worth the money. Photos are very clear and in color. Writing is clear and to the point. Subject matter is well laid out and easy to follow. If you are interested in Jiu Jitsu, this is an excellent choice."
5,Great BJJ book,"I was recommended this book by my professor along with Jiu-Jitsu University by Saulo Ribeiro, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: For Experts Only by Carlson Gracie and Julio Fernandez, both of which you can find on amazon. Some of these techniques are taught in muy classes others are not. They are all great supplements to BJJ classes and I have practiced several of the techniques while rolling. I highly recommend all 3 of these books to add to any BJJ students library."
3,"""Jiu-jitsu for Dummies""",There are a lot of useful techniques on the book. It helped me to keep in mind of what an opponent can do to me. What I didn't like was how the it combined different levels in one book. It was designed to help a jiu-jitsu freak who doesn't have any Dojo around nor partner to practice with.
5,this book is the best,"I've seen a lot of giraffe hunting manuals in my time, but this one is the worst ever made.Where are the single picture of a giraffe in this book.Secondly, why are these men wearing those robes?How do they keep them so white and clean out on the hot african savanah ?Totally impractical.Only a fool would by this book. Therein lies the jib. In this sense its a brilliant cash cow, a real genius scheme, if i do say so. Brilliant! Good show then!Let the cash roll in boys, and my 5 stars to you as well."
2,Blah--leaves sour taste in my mouth,"Let me start out with my credentials. I have been in the Army where I learned some fighting skills employed by the world's best. I have continued my training in submission wrestling, learning from the best like Dave Roy and Kirik Jenness in Amherst, Michigan. I know like a gazillion submissions. I wonder what Renzo was thinking with this book. I wonder what his motives are? He is just trying to make money presenting some watered down judo that won't work against my grandmother. You are better off buying ""The Fighter's Notebook"" or Gene Lebell's ""Pro-wrestling finishing holds"" believe me. This stuff will get you killed.Nick""Machine""May"
4,Basic BJJ Book,"This is a nice, basic BJJ book. High quality breakdown and pictures, few mistakes. 4 stars for quality, 2.5 stars for usefulness.I got this hoping for a book with examples of lots of variants of basic techniques, and this was not that book. I was hoping to replace a lost book full of variants of basic techniques that I liked to dig into for reference to subtle variants of things like Americanas.This book is a basic white-to-blue book. And, if you are at this level, you will only get most of this by going to BJJ class more regularly. There is a ""purple"" section but no purple is going to pay attention to techniques in a book like this. Purple is earned on the mat.Bottom line a very nicely produced book, solid pictures and examples. But you aren't going to pick up most of this book from the book. You are better off with time on the mat, and free BJJ technique videos on YouTube."
1,Percy the Park Keeper 's The Rescue Party,"Percy the Park Keeper, The Rescue Party is the stuff of which little girls' nightmares are made. It is full of loveable animals who are appealing to a two-year-old. But the happy picnic plot revolves around a little girl bunny falling into a dark and frightening well and having to be rescued. What kind of early childhood entertainment is that?"
3,Sharpe plus,"This is the beginning of a new series by Bernard Cornwell, author of the popular Sharpe series. This book is set during the Hundred Years war between the English and French monarchies. The hero is a bowman, essentially a mercenary in the service of the English King, though with a better educational background. This is actually a better book than many of the Sharpe novels. The background detail in greater and Cornwell makes a real attempt to display the reality of medieval warfare, as opposed to the silly romantic accretions found in most novels about this period. Despite Cornwell's best intentions, the book does not really describe key elements of Medieval life. Essential features such as the feudal bond as the basis for society and the penetration of religion into all aspects of life are not dealt with."
2,Dull & Bloody,This book was an alright read but it really dragged in parts. The author often seemed determined to show the depth and breadth of his historical research instead of delivering a well paced story. Amazingly even the climatic battle scenes dragged on and on with repetitive workmanlike writing. It felt at the end like Cornwell was writing to hit an total page count for his publisher. This whole book could have been 100 pages shorter and better for it.
3,Stick to Sharp,"More like 3 and 1/2 but I couldn't bring myself to give 4. Maybe because th ebook is ""The new deal""AnywayCount on Cornwell to give you good battle scenes, other then that don't get this book(Or get it at the Library). The plot can be seen in the much better Warlord trilogy. I don't know the book just seemed to lose something in the translation.Thomas's town is attacked he is (luckily) out of town at the time and is able to kill a few of the attackers with his bow. He learns that the village priest(his dad) who he thought was just nuts was really a noble hiding from his crazy family. Where it goes from there really gets wackyOverall-Read if you are an old hand at this, not a good Cornwell introduction"
4,Eye opener,"Adventuring into the history of the 1300's, the Archer' s Tale was an eye opener to the simple history we all learned as kids. Brutal war, savage revenge and simple but life sustaining spoils were not an expectation going into the book. I could not put it down. Real characters and an empathy for their experiences. Awesome, great reading for adventure seekers ... on to book two!"
5,Antidote for Video games,"My younger son, college age, has has not developed the habit of reading books that are not required. But he does like outdoor adventure both viewing & participating. So I bought him the books 1&2 of this series. He devoured them in days and has now read 3 other books in 2 weeks rather than 3 months.I have read Cornwell's Arthur trilogy with great pleasure.Three cheers for Bernard Cornwell."
4,Excellent,"I admit to being an avid Cornwell fan. I have read, I believe, all of his books. While i do not believe The Archers Tale is as good as Cornwell's absolutely extraordinary King Arthur series, or his nearly-as-good Saxon tales, it is nonetheless an excellent reading experience."
3,"Good , if a little dry, stuff...","The best book of ""The Grail Quest Trilogy"". I hoped the story of Thomas of Hookton would become more vibrant as I read, but for me, it remained a well written, action-packed, yet somehow boring series. If you usually enjoy Bernard Cornwell, as I do, buy this book, but resist the temptation to see how it all ends. You may be disappointed.I bought all three, and the characterizations just got more two-dimensional as I went."
1,Are you kidding? Feh.,"Well, firstly the packaging should have BOLDLY stated that the book was abridged. Secondly, the title should have concluded with ""PART 1"" to let the buyer know that it was incomplete.Why do all the French sound like pip-squeaks? It was like Peter and the Wolf with Smith using a reedy flute to do all the French voices. I wanted to bite off my own ear. And what happended to the character development of the Black Bird? She goes from deadly enigma to whimpering twit in a heartbeat.I could go on, but why throw good verbage after bad. I find that I don't care about the characters at all.Kris"
4,Medevil Mastry,"This is the first book in a three book series - Archer's Tale, Vagabond, and Heretic. As I am an audiobook junky I will tell those who are interested that there are unabridged audio downloads of these books at audible.com. These are masterfully told and kept my attention throughout. These are my first Bernard Cornwell books but definitely won't be my last. If these are any indication of his story telling prowess then I'm definitely a new fan.Thomas of Hookton is raised from childhood to be an English longbowman. Raised by his eccentric and mad relative (a priest) and orphaned young in his life the story of Thomas's search for the secrets of his family's past which holds within them the secrets of the Holy Grail is fascinatingly told. Rich vivid characters and a rivoting storyline along with masterful storytelling. Well worth the time to read and one I will listen to again and again."
2,The Decimating Hero,"The hero goes with his band of archers, on a killing and raping spree across France. This he enjoys. Life is good. They leave farms and defenseless villages destroyed. Very romantic stuff. The nobility do alright though. The villian decides to rape nobility and this is his great flaw. If he stuck to screaming peasants it would have been OK. The heroine is saved from him by her nobility apparently. She falls in love with the hero. Perhaps she likes it rough. All historically accurate, but why anyone should accept this as a viable romance or adventure I don't know. Unless the readers who love this book are human - in which case it is understandable. Humans are given to mauling each other in a way beasts never do. How this book can be distinguished from a deary wallow in the worst human behavior and the ussual facile validation of it, I can not say."
5,a terrifying trip into the mind of a schizophrenic,"Truly one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. Peter Green is dead-on as a paranoid schizophrenic as we go inside his mind to hear the voices, and experience his rage and terror. What is almost more disturbing is how those in the external world, even his mother, refuse to try to understand or trust him--he is a complete outsider and isolated from both himself and those he loves. Not a film for the faint of heart--especially the self-mutilation scenes, but worth a look for anyone interested in films that don't pander to their audience. This one practically attacks you with its imagery and point of view!"
3,"Nice product, works well",Authentic Toner cartridges are so expensive!!! This product is of nice quality and lasts a little less that the more expensive authentic toner cartridges.
5,Works great,"This is a great product. I don't know how they can sell these so cheap, but it produces a nice dark black, and I would buy it again."
1,Poor Product Performance,"Received the toner on time as expected. However the toner received was likely either gray market or counterfeit. The packaging material looked legitimate, but the toner never performed well. I replaced it with a real H-P cartridge that I purchased from a local office supply store. I will not use this merchant (rtechnologyus) again."
4,Go 4 it.,Arrived in good time. Prints well and the price was great. Can not speak to the # of pages it will produce as it will take me some time to find that out.
3,Good value for the price,Product works as planned and for the price. The quality with which it prints is nearly the same as the previous toner cartridge (HP) that I had.
