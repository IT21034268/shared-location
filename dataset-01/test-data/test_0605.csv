3,Is it raining again???,"I have read Relic, Riptide and Ice Limit all by the same authors and I enjoyed them all. Maybe I would have enjoyed this one more if it was the first one of them that I read as opposed to the 4th one. I guess after 4 books I got tired of ""the biggest rain storm in 50 years"" happening to set up the main problem. If you haven't read the other ones I mention read them first and maybe pick this up at the used book store when you run out of stuff to read."
3,Not up to snuff,I didn't care for this one as much as his other books. The book was too long and I kept waiting for something to happen more suspensful as in his other books. But I will be anxiously waiting his next book to read.
4,A great adventure novel,"Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston know how to write a good book. Anyone who has ever read ""Relic"" can attest to that. They know how to write great characters and convincing plots and scenes that will have you holding tight to your pillow as you read them in bed. They know what scares us.And they know what excites us. Thunderhead is exciting. It's Indiana Jones exciting! It's the sense of adventure in a dangerous place. Searching for a lost city made of gold! The cast of characters is great - especially with Bill Smithback back for more Preston/Child fun. This a great read that will leave you eager to do a little exploring of your own.FYI: If you are a fan of novelists who drop their characters from one book into other books (i.e. Stephan King), then you should check these guys out. Read `em in this order: Relic, Reliquary, Thunderhead, Cabinet of Curiosity, Still Life with Crows, Brimstone, and Dance of Death (brand new).Good reading!"
4,Not the best thriller but pretty close,"Thunderhead had enough elements of the ideal thriller to keep me thinking about it after I had read half of the book from the library. I ended up waiting for the paperback and bought it as soon as it came out so I could keep it until I finished it. This is a great, great rollercoaster ride. There are some slow parts, but by and large this is about as close as you can get to writing a novel that is ""unputdownable."" I am not from the region in which the novel is set, so I can't say anything for the accuracy of the setting, but the mystery kept me going more than the promise of realistic local color. These guys know how to keep you glued to the edge of your seat as well as Michael Chricton. If Jurassic Park is your standard, you won't be disappointed by Thunderhead."
5,Perfect,"After a few years trying other types and brands, struggling with constantly switching attachments, Gardena comes through. It simply works, well. Does not leak and does not reduce the hose pressure. These fit on ""US"" hoses just fine. Along with the Female attachment these are a must. I used Teflon tape on all threads just to be safe and they still threaded on with ease."
4,Fast summer beach read,I really enjoyed About That Man. Meeting new characters from a new setting. Imaging the town set up etc... I am on the 3rd book of this sries and recommend it to anyone. Sheryl Woods is a good read.
5,critical issue of the day,"A timely, informed book that explains the present problems in education today. Every school should have this book in their libraries. Education is possible in this country today not just school attendance. Informed parents will see that their children do have a right to first rate education whether in the public schools or a school of choice. It is time for our public schools to recognize the problems facing them and do something about it."
3,"No chills here,but an interesting,fun read.","The House Next Door wasn't as spooky as I was hoping for,but neither did my interest lag,so that's a good thing. It was a pretty good ghost story and I thought the info about the psychic connection between Emma and her twin brother Charlie was really interesting and quite creepy to think about!So it is worth considering for a quick ghost story read."
1,works great the first time...then never again!,Whe i first used this i thoguht my prayers had been answered. Until i tried to use it a second time and it wouldnt work. I contacted the company about getting a replacement or what to do to troubleshoot and they told me they no longer make them. I wonder why?
2,Blocked in El Paso del Norte,"The stories are disjointed and incomplete. Several leave one without any definite indication of resolution or suggested direction of resolution. The plot never solidifies in some and is barely evident in others. A compiliation of rambling thoughts and occurences, barely connected overall into a cohesive, enjoyable story. Left me very disappointed."
5,The favorite on my bookshelf,"Just as was about to leave the bookstore, I reached for one last book to look at...and im glad i did. Absolutly beautiful design. Pure inspiration for any designer."
1,She's learned a lot since these were written!,"The volume contains two old Stephanie James novels, DANGEROUS MAGIC, which is virtually unreadable (ZERO stars, if only one could award such a rating), and AFFAIR OF HONOR, which is better but still worth no more than two stars, and that if one is feeling generous. It really irks me when a popular novelist's old books are reissued to ride the coattails of the good work she's done more recently, but I suppose the publishing company needs the money. Too bad, because these can only bring the author embarrassment."
3,Disappointed In Arkansas,"I am a great fan of Jayne Ann Krentz, but she missed the boat on this two-in-one. Even though I love books with strong male characters, I found myself frustrated with the overpowering men and their conflicted female counterparts."
3,A Pretty Good Documentary,"I saw this episode of Biography under the new title ""Bruce Lee - Immortal Dragon"" on a low-priced DVD. While it doesn't go into enormous detail and is relatively short, it is still a pretty entertaining and complete version of Bruce Lee's life. I would reccommend it mostly to aspiring fans of Lee. One part of the documentary that I liked was a nifty section on the many Bruce Lee imitators that came after Lee's death. Like most documentaries found in the bargain bin, the film clips are mostly from public domain sources.As an extra feature, the DVD contains trailers for Bruce Lee's ""The Chinese Connection,"" ""Fists of Fury,"" ""Enter the Dragon,"" and ""Return of the Dragon,"" as well as trailers for Jackie Chan's ""The Big Brawl,"" Steven Seagal's ""Above the Law,"" and Chuck Norris' ""The Octagon"" and ""A Force of One."" All of these trailers are pretty entertaining. The biggest shortcoming of the DVD is that it contains no chapter stops - this is a source of frustration."
4,great for soft listening,"I really like this CD for just relaxing and kicking back. Perfect mood setter. Highly recommend! Wish it was a little longer, and one of the songs has a strange intro, but other than that, really, really good."
4,yoyo is great,"It is great, but does seem a little flimsy. A very light yoyo. It can do sleepers for a very long time. Worth it though."
5,Drapery cord,Good quality cord. was able to replace the cord on a 10 foot rod. Easy to follow instructions for cord replacement.
3,Not bad...for new ABBA fan,"This is what it says. Just simply a review of ABBA's biggest hits and a general review of each album. If you are a die hard ABBA collector and have every tape of every rare performance and TV appearances you may pass this up. But if you are new to ABBA you may find interesting the clips used in this presentation. Much of these clips have never been on DVD before, TV appearances in Japan, Germany, ect. However they are not complete and only highlights. Still this is an interesting collection since it speaks only about the music, the reviewers some that belong to an ABBA tribute band give very good insight as to the songs construction. If you are a fan, this is interesting stuff, 2 DVD's , extras include photo gallery and a book. Not bad."
1,Homeowner,I purchased two of these to replace older revolving sprinklers made by Melnor. The spray arms are set at to low and angle and have a hole on top that shoots water up in the air. When set as fan spray and low volume the fan hits a few feet from the unit instead of going up in the air. This was a real engineering failure.I e-mailed Melnor yesterday and offered to FEDEX them to their facility to evaluate the problem. Looks like someone engineered the up angle to fit the box for packing instead of function.
3,Great PAL video?,I put up thirty dollars to obtain this video only to find out it is done in PAL. Why PAL? I can't play it on my Sony Blue Ray DVD theater system nor my other Sony dvd player or even on my Wii system and also some lap tops. It is very very limited to were I can play this. Result? A fairly interesting video on a very limited type of media that for the price you pay is not worth it.I was able to finally view it sitting in front of my computer.How do you share this with a bunch of freinds? You can't. Doesn't deserve five stars because of this.
2,On the right track,If your 16 years old you should love this CD. If your a veteran of music like I am this will fall short of your expections after a listen or two.I just wasn't that moved by these guys this time around.They need to dig a hole lot deeper to in press me the next time around.I think they can do it.I think they have what it takes to make a good CD and I'll be waiting for it.
3,a fascinating man,"I'd heard Erdos name come up several times in discussions of mathematics but had no real idea who he was until I bought this fascinating DVD. If ever there was a man who could just float through life on the strength of his intellect alone Erdos is he. He is by turns amusing, gentle, simple but undeniably brilliant and driven. A remarkable portrait of a remarkable man, compelling whether or not you care about math."
2,Not correct sizing!!,"Everyone in my family has owned these clic goggles. My original pair gave out after three years of use. I ordered these because they said ""standard size"" they normally come in small medium and large. WEll, I am medium and the standard size is large (same as my husbands). I had to tape them at the back to make them smaller so I could wear them. Did not have time to return....very disappointed. Will consider this before ordering from you again."
3,Does size matter?,"I ordered standard size goggles, iridium lens. I received them nicely packed with the sign clearly stating on the box that the size is standard. I don't have a particularly large head, but these could be barely put on, not to mention trying to ""clic"" them. I read anywhere in the review here that some guy was unlucky because he was getting them too big or too small, i'd say he was lucky to get them too big. To be precise i proceeded and measured them so buyers can compare and see for themselves.The goggles measure 5.5 inch wide and 8.75 inch long when stored in the original box. The lens is approximately 2.25 inch at its widest point. Once again these were supposed to be a standard size. If any of you have small size goggles please post the measurements so we can compare.The magnet which holds the glasses together is not particularly strong, so expect them to come off every now and than."
2,"Good idea, but does not work well in practice","I first bought the standard, and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well. I used them riding a bike in the winter months. Neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit. For the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering (and prevent tearing) causes great pressure above the ear. The rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely. I retired my Clics when I found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists."
1,"The more I read, the less I understand","This book is clearly not for me, and I have a degree in sociology. I waddled through its turgid pages, and at the end came out less informed that I went in. I really don't know what it's about. Now, I'm sure many succeding commentators will lambast me for my sad igonorance. Sure, go ahead."
2,Deals with the basics only,"This book is a good introduction to the basics of networking, but provides very little ""advanced"" information. Most of what's in the book can be found on any number of web sites dedicated to the subject of networking. I was looking for more of an understanding of the nitty gritty details of computer networks, but didn't find what I was looking for in this book. There's very little troubleshooting information, which is a surprise given how often ""troubles"" arise when networking computers."
5,replacing missing knife,"Somehow, I have lost or misplaced one of these steak knives that was part of a collection in one of those wooden blocks. I found the same ""model"" and purchased a set of four steak knife replacements (God forbid), but have been quite satisfied with the quality."
3,Doesn't work fast enough,"I saw a roach and I sprayed it with this stuff and it just kept slip-sliding around walking really fast(very healthy looking, and unphased) traveling all over the wood floor. Finally after practically drowning him with this stuff, he finally stopped in one place. He finally died, but it took awhile. I did not give this a worse rating because, hey, he finally died, and it is supposed to be safer than the harsh chemical sprays you get. Also it has a VERY STRONG odor. I am not sure I can get it out. I am glad I have wood floors, because I seriously doubt it would be easy to remove the odor from carpet.I would use it again, however, because I am against harmful chemical bug sprays and I have not found any other green alternative yet."
4,Best Sprinkler,"I have owned this sprinkler for 4 years. It's lasted the longest of any sprinkler I've ever purchased. It was impossible to find it in any garden center or hardware store where I live. I'm grateful to [this site] for carrying the products. However, I'm disappointed that this and the last Gardena product I purchased took much longer than the advertised delivery time."
1,What a wonderful piece of CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Deadly,Unna?. This is the title of the bigest piece of crap I have ever read. This book makes a mockery of even other crap books like ""the giver"" and ""specky magee""(i paid no attention to my spelling for those two books for they are not worth my holy attention). The main character's name is BLACKY. He is supposed to be the lovable character. In my wise opinion, BLACKY is the character you are supposed to hate. Since i feel so strongly about how I dislike this so called book, I would like to spoil a major incident in the book so you dont have to read it. there is a scene when two Aboriginals get shot. this acctually happend in real life. one of them that were killed is BLACKY's best freind. This book should never be read in schools or for fun. it has one purpose, fire wood. thank you."
1,What can I dooooooo!!!!!!!!??????????,"I'm from Brazil. My sub pack is broken.. after few monthes of use, I asked Amazon for send to My mother's hotel who is in N.Y. I gave my international card and for my surprise... they cannot sell my, because the brasilian adress.... I'm really nervous because there's no where to buy it in N.Y. stores.... just throw my X5 on trash...I really agree and unterstanda with all of you, whorst in my case I even cannot buy it... no one no where sells it.Dumb Dumb Dumb and more Dumb this sub pack"
1,Very Bad Design,"If you have a Cowon Iaudio x5, x5L or M3 model then you know how dumb this subpack is. The most important connections of the player is shoved onto a small easy to loose fragile plastic add on. If you loose it or break it and you will sooner or later, you will be here buying one. Without this you won't be able to charge your player, transfer songs or connect it to another device for dubbing. The really bad thing about having to buy this subpack is that it seems that only Cowon is selling it on Amazon."
3,Even in NECA standards it's not good,"When I bought this item I knew I was buying an average quality item but even with this in mind it wasn't good!My figure have a black scratch on his nose and the whole figure is covered with dust like thing, and they have put some details in the mask to make it look old and this is not a movie accurate thing.it's just a memorabilia for an amazing movie that I wish nobody will take a closer look at."
1,Trash?,"As a big Weis/Hickman fan I had great expectations to their new series. I did not even finish this book. Too many, less interesting characters, for my taste. The plot,as far as I read, was kind of cool though."
2,2-dimensional,"Hardly an insightful satire, it is rather one continuous repetitive republican joke about how gore is stiff, janet has a firm handshake, and clinton chases women - as if that was everything that defined these people. I can take a good satire - just make it, at least, interesting."
2,"Bought two, they both broke within weeks.",The water control mechanism failed on both of thesehose shut-offs within a few weeks. Went to the hardwarestore and got metal ones.
4,soft and lovable,This is a soft and cuddly toy. My daughter has a collection of stuffed cats and this one is one of the better quality ones. Very well loved and played with.
4,Was a very personal account of a real person.,"Although I bought this book to find out the stories behind the Kink's music, such as Lola and other hits, Dave Davies spent most of the book telling of his days of debauchery. But I came away feeling almost like I knew him, because he told his story, however pathetic at times, in a very pesonable, unaffected way. The driving force behind the Kinks is really the screwed-up relationship between Dave and his genius brother, Ray. I would recommend it to any Kinks fan."
5,I love cranky saints!,"This book does a great job of telling the story as a legend. We do not know what of this tale is truth and what is fiction. There is a spirit of discovery about it and evidence that it is based in truth. Also, it clearly shows St. Brendan as flawed, holy but flawed. Too often we think of saints as ""perfect people."" I love cranky saints. They give me hope."
1,not worth the money at all!,"OK, I was stupid enough to not read the reviews and buy this product. I returned it the day I received it. if you are taller then 3 feet it's not worthy. or maybe you like wobblely images? DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! even if you can get it for free... it will annoy you more than anything."
4,Not that bad,It has tripod (ok not great) and bag just good enough to carry some MiniDV & Song Camcorder TVR25 plus Canon Digital camera S30. Cleaning kit is ok. Overall it ok & Bag is good. It was free with my order.
3,good considering it was free,I'm happy with this kit. It came free with my camcorder order. The bag and lens kit was handy. The tripod I've found to be so-so. It works but still seems flimsy in some respects. All around this is a decent kit.
5,best buy,tried many plastic sprinklers all of which fall apart.the Melnor will last a life=time .great value
5,Great Water Sprinkler!,Bought at the beginning of summer and it has done great....I water out of the lake since the water is free if you live on waterfront property. I needed a good and tough sprinkler and this one fits the bill. Came in handy this HOT summer! Seems like the heat would eventually crack the plastic sprinklers but not this one since it's not made from plastic. I guess you get what you pay for! I DID!!
4,"Good quality, you get what you pay for","Bought two years ago, been through two winters out doors leaning against the house, although I did drain and shake out the water. Only complaint is it's a little pressure sensitive and hangs on at the end of the pulse phase and eventually will click over and return. Needs a good flow and pressure to work well. But well built, haven't dropped it so can't swear to abuse tolerence. I'd buy another."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I was very disappointed in this dvd, I thought I would be well on my way to restoring some old photos , I found very minimal lessons on the topic, I would have felt better paying more for a complete instruction dvd rather than a few lessons. I did however found the few lessons helpful to a point."
3,Not that great,"I had high hopes for this book. My teacher isn't very good, but I'm really good at java programming so I thought I would get a 3 or 4 even though I'm only a sophomore. I got my score today and I got a disappointing 1! The book doesn't really review that well and it combines A and AB into a small book. It had alot of info which is included on the reference card of the ap test. I stressed studying this stuff too much when it's included on the test. Skip this one and buy another. I'm taking AB next year and I'm going to find another book."
4,Work!,The tea works great. I drink one cup a day. I don't suffer from any discomfort or nausea. I have lost 5 lbs in one week. I have already placed my second order. I drink it with lemon jucie and splenda.
4,Went 2 bathroom twice...,"I took this tea late one evening and the next morning...Oh my god...felt like I lost 5 pounds. Anyway, went twice in one day. Does cleanse your body."
3,Get Your Kappa Mikey Fix Somewhere Else,"I was surprised that this DVD only contained three episodes. It really annoys me to see DVDs for cartoon episodes that are under a full season. I guess for $9 it's not so bad, though. They do have all of Season 1 DVD in Australia for $40, but I suggest going on iTunes. The entire series is $60 ($30 per season)"
5,Keep it Clean,"This works better than the quick connects purchased at a major hardware chain, especially with other Gardena connectors. If it gets sand on it from the sandy soil at the preserve garden it won't come apart very easily. In this case, wash both connectors and apply plumber's silicone grease."
1,Doesn't work in our SCPH 90001,"I bought this based on the Product Features that assures ""Compatible with PS2 models SCPH 70000 and 90001"", but this does not work in our SCPH 90001 PS2 console. Fail.I'd like a refund or an exchange for a different unit that will work in our console.I'm sure it works in the right console, but I only gave it 1 star because it doesn't work for me."
5,"Lyrical, and thought provoking","I don't want to give away the ending of the story, but it left me deeply moved. And I thought, ""What if what this book professess to be true really IS true?"" I hope with all my heart that it is.Allen's style is very moving and lyrical--almost impressionistic. Does anyone know if John Allen has written any other books. I did a net search and found other books by people named John Allen, but not the John Allen who wrote Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices. If there are other books by this particular John Allen I want to read them!!!"
2,"its not what you think it is, alas","This book isnt to be confused with other bible code books, its more a maths proof rebuffing the arguments against the whole bible code idea. It even uses a different technique and gets different results than the biblecode books.Is it right, i am not sure but it wasnt a fun or interesting read thats for sure..."
4,Not what I had anticipated.,"This book was interesting in some spots, but I had difficulty following it and lost my enthusiam. I gleaned a few new things from it though and someone with a different thought process might really love reading it."
2,Potato chips for your brain,"This book is a good story gone bad. It is full of tabloid antics and goofy characters whose only purpose is... well, I'm not sure. Some characters, such as Henry Prince, are so unbelievable that they take away from the somewhat compelling plot."
2,mediocre at best,"i wasnt really impressed with this one, its seemed a bit unreasonable to me at times"
5,Captivating,"I read this book a few years ago and was amazed at how the author was able to bring in so much drama while not letting it get out of hand. This was a well-written, well paced novel. Enough drama to keep the pages turning and not too much to make you gasp. I was captivated from beginning to end."
2,I'm Telling you not to waste your money!!,"After reading the first couple lines, I just that I was in for a good read, WRONG!!(not wanting to tell the story but...)What was the purpose of the three pages wasted on the ""five percenters""? And Miss Irene did nothing but get excited over a hot meal and bottle of cheap wine.Mrs. Miller tried get out too much and nothing was flowing right. The characters were not developed and the story line was weak.I was disappointed and this book will be returned."
1,This book is way outdated!,"I was excited to read this book as it had excellent reviews on Amazon. I also thought that its content was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, the book turned out to be a great disappointment.This was due to the fact that this book was written in 2006! The references in the book are extremely old (considering the fast pace of mobile technology). For instance, there is no mention of iphones, ipads or Android devices. To me, a book on mobile media without any references to these new technologies is useless. The book goes on and on about the great opportunities offered by SMS! They also talked about the way European and Asian companies were re-defining the mobile industry. I am sure that Steve Jobs would not like that.I am sure that this book was a great read back in 2006, but in five years, many things have been changed. This book needs an immediate revision."
4,Good product,Replacing broken plastic connector.Looks good quality. I loosened up the dials with pliers and now they are easy to turn by hand.
4,Fine y adapter,Worked well this season. We'll see how many season I get but it seems like a fine product.
1,Works great...for one year...not worth even one star after a year!,This Y connector worked great for the first year. Just today when I turned on my hose it was leaking around the swivel part. Tightening did nothing. The rubber washer had just been replaced so was fine. Upon closer inspection the thin brass at the swivel had split making it the weakest link. Of course they will not make these like they were made 30 years or longer ago because then we might only need to buy one. If this piece of crap has to be replaced every year why even try to buy American anymore!
1,CONTAINS LEAD! Beware!,"I got my Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector today and was excited, until I noticed that it was wrapped in a plastic bag (odd) and read on the back of it that it contains lead and may lead to birth defects or cancer. Also included was a warning to wash hands after use. Sorry, I'm watering chickens and veggies with this, and this is unacceptable."
5,Excellent product,"So much better than the ones that are all plastic. Valves are air tight, easy to turn. Bought another one recently. Love them."
3,NOT OK FOR HOT WATER!!,"I am splitting the hot water connection to my washing machine and bought this valve because the description states it withstands hot water temperatures. However, when it arrived, it clearly states on the back ""Do not use with water exceeding 100F"". Besides the inaccurate product description and the lead warnings, it does seem like a decent build quality."
3,ok product,"If all you're looking for is to split the line of your faucet this will work fantastic, But if you're looking for high amounts of water this limits the amount of water in some fashion."
2,fragile,"i like Gardena sprinklers (the Aquazoom is the queen of efficient hose-dragging), but the quick-connects are prone to snap with heavy use, so if you are a rugged gardener like me, giving your hoses an occasional stiff tug or an aggressive scoot with the foot, i recommend you skip these quick-connects and get brass ones instead; the brass ones we have show no sign of trouble ten years on, but unfortunately i can't recommend a specific model because some brands don't quite fit the others"
2,Deceptive Image. No dimentions,"Because ""Get Organized"" apparently uses no measuring tools to get organized, in their adverts or otherwise, you are forced to look at pictures to make a decision. Now from the image, you could guess the size to this bamboo mat to be 24'' by 72"" or somewhere close. After all the only thing I have to compare is the ceramic tiles on the floor. Ok, so I ordered it. Turns out, the rug is no where close to the picture. It's 24"" by 36"". About half the size the image shows. I'm disappointed and returning it."
2,Elevator Muzak?,"I have admired Cal Tjader since the 50's. However, this merger of two of his most forgettable albums left me cold. It projects blandness, lacks swing and the arrangements sound atonal,trite and limp. Clare Fischer at his worst? You can hear a difference in ""Tonight"", in latin tempo which is the one bright star in a blah disk. Two stars for this unfortunate CD, which I'm sure Cal himself would agree is a blatantly commercial attempt to add an ""easy listening"" label to jazz. A disappointment!"
1,bored,"Anybody who wants to 'dis' either series needs to get a life. Both have major entertaining values and is just a matter of personal opinion. I personally prefer Star Trek because it is more scientifically acurate, however Star Wars is a lot of fun. The point being IT DOESN'T MATTER! But onto the review of this dvd, It is just some schmuck's way of getting a quick buck off of die hard fans of one or the other (just like this latest Jason vs. Freddie Movie). The technical side of this movie is just so bad, that unless your into home movies, I wouldn't have spent a dime on it (and didn't since I returned it and got a refund)."
1,What is the point?,"No, I have not seen this, nor will I. I am a fan of BOTH and comapring the two is idiotic. Get a life, and don't waste the money on this."
2,More trash from HP,"This thing is going in the garbage. After a year of constant issues with the Fax picker constantly pulling 1-4 pages at a time (it's completely random), I've honestly had enough with it. It's my second HP, the first was also a junker. Not worth the money or your sanity. It's fine for simply printing, but that's about it. Do NOT buy it for the fax function. You will be very disappointed."
5,"Chronicles of Narnia The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe","Unfortunately, my daughters absolutely love this game, I have to set a timer for them to get off of it! Very fun!"
3,"Not quite what I expected, but pretty cool","I gave these a try after using something similar at my office and needing something for my home office. The stickies that come with were pretty useless - all of my squares fell the same day - and the cork falls apart pretty easily. BUT I got them up and if I don't meddle, they work just great."
4,Cork,"Makes a nice natural looking cork board. The board is slightly darker compared to the pictures, but has a nice overall tone.The only problem with this product is that it is very crumbly and gets everywhere when installing."
3,Elegia di Madonna Fiammetta,"E' un libro che ci viene dal Medioevo e ci testimonia una leggerezza di scrittura notevole. Ho letto questo libro perchè sono appassionata di medioevo ed amo scavare nel passato dell'umanità , poichè questo mi fa sentire tutt'uno con il passato il presente il futuro. Adoro la letteratura italiana e ne sono una profonda conoscitrice , non solo per letture personali , ma proprio per gli studi che svolgo da molti anni. L'elegia di Madonna Fiammetta è dedicata alle donne innamorate , straziate da passione e tradimento dell'amante . In questa opera Boccaccio inizia il tema che sarà uno dei filoni portanti del Decameron.Ciò che colpisce del libro è il sommesso parlare interiore del personnaggio e l'abilità narrativa di Boccaccio."
5,such books are RARE....,but why are the pages falling out of it?Dont they have enough sticky-stuff in indiawhere it was gathered an stuck-together???Send me the 'hardcover-version'an I'll be happierif you want the truth...I have it!
2,Poorly Designed,"We just purchased this stroller for our son who is just turning a year old. We wanted something lightweight and stylish as we just stopped using our heavy double stroller. This stroller is lightweight, under 12 pounds. We also really liked the look and color scheme. However, this stroller is almost impossible to collapse. You have to push down on this button and pull on this handle simultaneously. It was so hard to get it to release that my husband even had a lot of diffficulty closing it! The worst part was the back support for the child. It has a hard support piece behind the back that is curved within the material, and it made our son sit hunched over and he couldn't really sit with his back straight. He seemed so uncomfortable that after using it a couple of times, we have decided to get rid of it. I would definitely look into a different brand/stroller."
2,"""Holmes"" filter","The filter as delivered was not really Holmes branded and the built-in meter on my Holmes humidifier has read ""replace filter"" from day one using the replacement filter. I think the replacement filter really doesn't work well because now the water consumption of the humidifier in operation is about half of what it used to be with the original""factory"" filter. I have the brochure from the original humidifier package and there's a web address to order ""genuine"" Holmes filters. That will be my next step to see if I can get the humidifier's efficiency back to what I hope it can be."
1,Don't get this type of humidifier!!!,"The Holmes humidifier is the same old trick where they sell you a fancy printer for $15 and then you have to buy an ink cartridge for $39.99 every other week.The filters are not cheap and if you are concerned about your health you would replace them every other week since they begin to smell like a stale rotting pond.Cleaning the Humidifier is not a walk in the park, it is not built for easy cleaning.I recently bought one of those ultrasonic humidifiers that don't require a filter and are easy to clean (you just wipe the interior)."
2,Bad out of the box,My humidifier told me to replace the filter the day after I installed it. I also had to trim the filter to fit.
1,Junk!,"I wish we could buy American products that lasted. This Filter is junk!!! It lasted less than a week under normal conditions and it requires re-wetting every few hours after that. I am so tired of wasting my money.Amazon, What is your problem, run out of good quality companies to do business with. You have lost a lot of my business the last couple years and will continue to do so unless you pull your heads out!!"
2,Rusts and Rots,"I purchased two of these for my Holmes humidifier. Seller was good, but product is bad.Firstly, the picture looks like the filter is surrounded by plastic. The product in fact doesn't have the black surround, but a metallic wire frame instead. After a few days of use, the water turned yellow, the metal is oxidized (I assume rust), and the filter is growing some white crusty stuff. The water I used goes through a water softener and reverse-osmosis system so it's quite pure.I'll be discarding this and the second filter that I haven't opened. It's priced low so it's not even worth returning."
5,filter,Works fine. Nothings else to say about the filters. Will order again. Works fine. Nothing else to say about the filters.
3,Adequate needs upkeep,"This filter will work longer than many reviews have indicated. What keeps it fresher is to wash your tank, basin and filter in vinegar. Pour a little vinegar in the basin, tank and fill with water. Dump this water over your filter while rinsing. Rinse everything with cold water. This should be done once a week. It helps to turn the filter over each time you fill up. Cheap store vinegar will cost $2 and should get you through one winter season."
3,Real McCoy limps back to the Euro-Top 40,"IT'S ON YOU is not a bad song....really it's not. It's just that it is a little disappointing considering that the rest of the singles by Real McCoy have been very solid. This Euro-dance track is definitely danceable, but it lacks a memorable chorus and gets annoying on repeated listenings. They even stick a bit in the song that sounds like ""The Vengaboys are back in town"", but even that bit of Venga-esque coolness can't save this song."
2,A boy goes on a quest to find his spirit.,"I've read this book before and it was dumb.I didn't like it. It was a boring book. It didn't excite me. It almost made me go to sleep.Reading about dead places and the places of the God's, it's a bunch of bolony. It didn't really have a plot to it. Anyway this kid had to go on a journey to find his spirit. So he has a dream about going to the place of the Gods. He gets there and he see's all these abandoned buildings. This pack of dogs starts to chase him. He runs into the building. He sleeps there for the night. The stories he was told were all false. About if you step on the ground it will burn your feet. Finally he goes back home and tells his dad what he saw."
2,just as bad as the courseware,"I'm a CIW instructor. I've been using Prosoft courseware in my classes for two years, and have never been pleased with it -- especially the Foundations courseware. This book is written by the same people and it's just as bad. Dry as a bone and full of inane information that none of my students have ever been asked on an exam. This biggest challenge on the Foundations exam for most of my students is the Networking Fundamentals portion and while this book does cover the needed material, it doesn't do a very good job of breaking down some of the most complicated concepts -- such as the OSI model. I encourage my students to get supplemental materials that enhance the material covered in the courseware -- not rehash it."
1,A reader with Agoraphobia isn't blind,"I shared his book with two other individuals who know I suffer from agoraphobia and panic disorder before I read it myself. Their feedback was stating nothing more than this is another try to get rich quick through book writing, once again, to impress his family.I have now finished the book and while I could relate to many of the inner feelings, the book offers nothing but self pity for the author. I bought this book hoping to make it ""through the rain"" myself. I read it and found the book severely lacking in any type sugestions other than strong-arming others into feeling sorry for you. If your depressed and want plently of excuses for people to feel sorry for you, this is your book.If your looking for a positive approach to deal with Agoraphobia, this book is a waste of your money. This same disorder has cost me much myself, including the purchase price of this book..."
5,Priceless!,"A remarkably good book from a bunch of folks who, for the most part, are not professional writers. The stories are fascinating and happily, most are well-written too. Methos fans will love it. Although Duncan puts in an occasional appearance, a surprising number of the stories revolve around the Really Old Guy. There's a cute (yet predictable) Amanda-caper. The ""Postcards from Alexa"" section has some very funny bits (""What do you mean 'the Grand Canyon is closed'?""). It also has some very painful bits and on the whole is wonderfully done. Richie and Joe show up in several stories. Valentine Pelka seems to have missed the point about contributing to a *Highlander anthology* but his novella is amazing nonetheless. Peter Wingfield contributed a decidedly odd take on the Horsemen. And the short story ""Pants"" can only be described as brilliantly ridiculous. It's a real treat to get to see the Highlander world through the eyes of these people. Well worth the money."
2,"Kind of interesting, but no real advice","I have read a lot of these kinds of books, and I found this one to be a little disappointing. I agree with all of her philosophy, and based on her checklist, I am very intuitive myself. But just telling me over and over that everyone is intuitive doesn't help me learn how to harness this skill to actually help myself or others! She basically tells about all the ways that intuition helps a person, and then points out how skilled she is at it with anecdote afer anecdote of her prowess, but never gives any REAL concrete advice. I finished the book with no more clue about how to actually use my intuition than when I started."
3,"Great for the basics, but...","I kept wanting more as I read this book. It's well written, an easy read but I wanted to know what she's learned that the rest of us don't know from doing these reading for the last 15+ years. Are these spirits around us 24/7? Why -- don't they have anything else to do (seriously)? Is the afterlife like the movie ""Defending Your Life""? (I too was curious enough to visit Char's web site and was shocked to find out the going rate for a reading was $500.) If Char writes another book, I'd ask that she please provide more information than what we can learn from watching a few John Edward episodes."
4,Good introduction book,"Easy to understand and written in first person, as if she is actually talking to you herself. It is a little scary though--be careful not to let evil sneak through if you ""open up""."
3,Important information. Poor production.,"The video starts with a lecture by Brent Phillips sitting at a table. The background appears to be a white wall with one picture. The sound has a slight hollow tone. Then he stands up and continues his lecture against a white wall and is joined by a female who demonstrates the muscle testing techniques as he continues to lecture. Then he sits back down at the table with white background and continues to lecture until the end of the video. The DVD does not have a menu with individual tracks for easy review of the techniques. You have to ""rewind"". Personally, I have seen better muscle testing technique videos on youtube. On the plus side, I feel he gives a very clear description of why muscle testing works."
5,The Greatest!,"My wife bought a copy of MERVIN at a public signing by C. Keith Odom, the author/illustrator about a week ago for our 8 year old son. He loves it. My wife loves it. I love it (and I hate reading children's books). This book is a DEFINITE improvement over the other children's books I've been forced to read over the last few years. I feel like it was written for ME instead of for my son. I could relate. Great job Mr. Odom. When is your next book coming out?"
5,Was nicer than I expected,"Has an push button auto-open which is nice. I'm just using it for a bridal shower decoration.Don't be fooled and think that this is a poor-quality, very nice, nicely made. Wouldn't be appropriate for period costuming because of the mechanism."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,Do not buy this item. Very poor quality. It fell apart before my grand daughter could use it for her Halloween costume. She was Mary Poppins. I had to order another parasol from a different company to replace it and since it was past 30 days wasn't able to return it.
2,disappointed..poor quality and dangerous,"If you have young children, I wouldn't recommend this product. The quality is just not there and its very dangerous because the caps fall off the metal ends of the umbrella leaving the sharp metal rod exposed. My daughter almost got poked in the eye when my other daughter walked passed her with it."
3,Muy interesante el juego,"Es facil de jugar de hecho se puede completar en dos semanas jugandolo de forma administrada, es decir, poco, lo recomiendo mucho para niños hasta de 8 años que le gusten los juegos de plataformas, es muy importante el leer ingles, el desarrollo del juego se indica con muchos textos en este idioma."
2,cubbies too small,Nicely built but the cubbies are too small for most shoes. I had to put most of my shoes sideways and that is using only one cubbie for one shoe. You could not get two shoes in any of the cubbies.
2,"OK Text, Commentary of Islam?","The Dhammapada text is fine. Cleary's commentary has a religious pluralism that is more American than Buddhist. I'm fine if Cleary has found a way to integrate many religions, but in a Buddhist text, it's best to leave other religions out of the commentary. Why would I want to read about Islam while reading the Dhammapada? I really don't want to know what Jesus might have said about a particular passage or what Moses would think about the Dhammapada. This seems to cause confusion. For those wishing to integrate multiple religions, there are many good texts for that already, but not a religious text like the Dhammapada. Neither would I like a Quaran full of comparative text from the Dhammapada or Vedas... Weird."
2,Why doesn't she do something?,"I read this book because somebody recommended it, but even though it was written pretty well and there's an interesting setting and some cool characters, the main character, Jane, drove me crazy. She's being victimzed by everybody, like her parents, a manipulative roomate, this sadistic boyfriend, her teachers, and she just sort of takes it and hardly does anything to fight it, and then in the end she runs away. (Who wouldn't?) But where's this big change they talk about on the book jacket? I can't relate to a character who's so passive about really important things that effect her whole life."
5,One great cookbook.,"Well known to most New England cooks, Marjorie Standish's cookbooks are a great source. Have known many a person who heads out to the freedom of their own apartment who got her books as a housewarming gift. Sometimes, more than one set. :)This cookbook is a must have for anyone who loves New England cooking. I had them when they first came out, and when I lost them during a move, made the effort here to replace them. That says a lot in itself. Marjorie's books are entertaining and well laid out. The only critique would be...why didn't see make more than she did. I only know of the two, this being the first. If you can get your hands on one, buy it. If you can get your hands on TWO, gift one to a friend. Five stars, because we can't give more stars than that. :)"
4,A Brilliant Graphic Novel,"When I first started reading graphic novels, which was about two years ago I thought that it was truly pointless because I was not familair with grpahic novels, I thought they were like comic books. I was wrong. The world of graphic novels is complex, and opens vast doorways into regions of the world that exist far beyond, and From Hell is one of those Graphic Novels that catches you by surprise and shakes you to the bone, I strongly recommend this work to any reader. The film adaptation was truly brilliant and compelling, rich with horrors and thrills and saturated with laughs and screams."
4,Scrutinize the ISBNs,"I just got this book in the mail and am disappointed to say that it is not a hardcover. Notice that the ISBN for this product is the same as for the paperback. Double check with your vendor, even though the photo is for a hardcover."
3,"Good book, not great","I was a big fan of the Watchmen and Top Ten, though I haven't enjoyed all of Moore's work nearly as much. So I picked up this collection without overly high expectations.I found myself engrossed by the story, but the art was so unclear that I found myself frustrated. The use of a large number of panels per page was a fine choice, and I think that a dark gritty approach was called for by the material. But in many panels I couldn't even tell what was represented, indistinct figures blend into the indistinct background so that many panels seem to be just a square full of shading with no forms for the shading to fill.Overall I'd recommend this to all the Alan Moore groupies and people who have the patience to sit and stare at each page until some sort of image finally becomes clear."
5,The Works,"Moore's admiration of Michael Moorcock is evident, but unlike so many of Moorcock's imitators, Moore builds on the master's techniques, makes them his own, takes over London and makes THAT his own. Echoes of Gloriana and Jerry Cornelius amplify rather than diminish his themes. Still the most talented original in graphic fiction, Moore proves again that he stands head and shoulders above the rest. The miserable movie version of this is a sentimentalized, Hollywood echo of Moore's complex genius. If you enjoyed the movie, then you will find the substance in this edition! Moore is a true original."
1,"Cheap, very low quality, worth maybe $5.00","The actual leash is simply a string and it has a leader at the end that looks like a child stitched it to the leash. The ""hook"" at the end is smaller than most leashes that holod up to 100lbs. This is not the same as a leash you would buy at Petsmart."
2,Close to Ullman,"This books smack's of insincerity. Whereas some readers might think Ullman's insights into technoculture enlightening, to me the dialog and characters seemed unnatural and manipulated. And I work in the industry. And much of it seems self-aggrandizing, as in ""...just then some blessed instinct took over, a subliminal skill still there after all those years of reading code. Something surfaced, miraculously out of the murk. 'Here it is... here's what you're looking for.'"" In the end, this is a book about Ellen Ullman, not about technoculture."
3,The technology aspects are excellent.,"The book's episodic accounts of her experiences in the industry and her observations regarding the technology's social impact are interesting and thought provoking. Other than that, who cares about your sex life, Ms. Ullman? If I was geuinely interested in such a book I'd know where to find it."
2,Okay for the beginner Wifi hacker,"There are some reasonable tips here about Wifi hacking. However, I know most of them already. The primary tips are the use of software for Wifi hacking. However, they do not go into great depth on all subjects.There is some other background on other 802.11 protocol information. But I don't consider a background on 802.11 family of protocols a ""tip"". That's just information. What I want is gems of practical and applicable ideas/methods that you can only learn from long experience.In that respect this is disappointing.If you're serious about Wifi hacking get Wi-Foo. If you want a painless and low cost introduction then Wireless Hacks is appropriate.-J_Tom_Moon_79"
3,Didn't fit my needs,"I have a service business - and this software just didn't meet my needs. I had a lot of difficulty figuring out how to use it (and I am a computer professional). It definitely wasn't as nice as I expected - although if you sell products & can take the time to figure out how to use this program, it *might* work for you. As for me, I'm returning it & simply using the invoice template in Microsoft Word... :\"
5,Four Brothers,"If You want a Reminder of the Old School Sounds of Growing Up in those Days of the late 60 to 70 and 80s Years? This is the CD you want to get? It is Fantastic, I Love It."
2,Doesn't Work,The Hdmi part works but the dvi display has green lines running through it to the point that you can't use it.
4,federal breaker,"nice to find a breaker for our older style panel, although we did have a hard time getting it delivered. The first box was sent with a door chime in it but had our Breaker packing list. The company was nice and did send the breaker, but it was another 7 days without electricity in half our home. They were supposed to send an e-mail with a return label so I could send back the chime, but the label never came, so the chime is still sitting in the box waiting to be returned.... it has been over 2 months."
1,horrible,"Usually when I buy a cookbook, it is because of the recipes and how close it is to being authentic. This cookbook does not come close at all. I love Vietnamese food and have grown up eating it and know how most dishes should look and taste like. This book will give the reader a small idea of what some of the dishes are but it is not authentic. There are too substitutions for too many ingredients that although the dishes may look valid, the ingredients are not. This book is definately not for readers with adventurous palates for Asian foods. This book is only good for the ones who only like to stay within the Northwestern taste limits. If you are looking for a Vietnamese cookbook that is close to being authentic, I suggest Corinne Trang."
1,Doesn't work on all computers,"I would like to say this is a great program, but it will not load on my computer.I have NEVER had this problem with any other program before. Some kind of computer glitch blamed on everyone else other than the person I happen to be talking to at the moment. After, about 30 mins of several toll calls and a couple downloads.....no luck.Well, I'm off for another program."
3,You can't return it... but the company rocks!,"The battery didn't end up solving my problem, and it sucks that you can't return it.HOWEVER, I called APC and they were able to help me in the replacement of my battery backup and it all worked out in the end. Good people."
4,Not bad for the price,"Bought this set because the 22"" was the largest I could get on the plane for my next trip. Got red so It will stand out at the airport. Quality isn't as good as the $200.00 or $300.00 sets but for the small amount of traveling I do, it serves my purposes. The little carry case looks weird but it holds a ton of stuff. I was able to put my entire purse, lap top and most of my toiletries in it."
4,nothing like it,"no matter if you like it or not, you are guaranteed to have a unique viewing experience if you watch this film. I have never seen anything remotely close to the same style or message of this movie. It is completely insane. Subliminal messages abound and it will keep your attention throughout. Not reccomended for the weak of heart. This is hard to find and very interesting."
4,"About a Different Culture, But Still Relatable","She's a teenager living in the shadow of her best friend--I mean, on some level, can't everyone relate? Plus, she's Indian (as in Asian Indian), and not exactly proud of it. At the same time, it's a love story, but she's not the type to get mushy (well not overly mushy), so it's got something in it for everyone. You even learn a little about her culture as you read. I definitely recommend it!"
5,Anything But Confused,"This is maybe one of the best books I've ever read. It's a honest tale about a rebellious teen trying to break away from her parents traditions. I love the way this book relates so much to what happens in real life and its honesty about it. Also, the character development is amazing. It's something every teenager, Indian or non, should read- most likely, they're in the same postion as Dimple! So if you havent read it, READ IT NOW!"
1,Speed Kills,"In the interest of speed, suffice to say that one minute spent on this book is a moment wasted."
3,Okay,"This has a lot of business cliches. Cliches often are cliches, though, because they're true. If you've never read a business book before, then this will be an eye-opener. But he basically recites everything you've already learned in your Peter Drucker books. And if you haven't read Peter Drucker, then you should read him before you read this. The chapter on hiring people is very good. It doesn't really deal with ""speed"" as much as the title promises, although it does deal with it. A better book about fast companies is IT'S NOT THE BIG THAT EAT THE SMALL, IT'S THE FAST THAT EAT THE SLOW. I thought that was a much better book about quick growth. But this isn't a bad book at all, and has much to recommend it."
5,"Insightful, inspirational and instructive","I am an MBA graduate of Babson College, Bob Davis' alma mater, and I have heard Bob speak many times at Babson and at other venues over the last three years. When I heard from him that his book was being released, I knew that I would read it, and I hoped for the best. I was not disappointed.Speed is Life, gives the reader an internal view into some of what was going on during the dot-com frenzy. It also includes valuable lessons that Bob was able to learn while being one of the leaders in this hypergrowth industry. The lessons are supported with real-life examples that clearly convey Bob's point as well as inspire an entrepreneur!One last item that I can add is that the ideas that Bob writes about are not a result of 20/20 hindsight. When I sat down to hear Bob speak in September of 1999, when I was beginning my MBA, he was preaching the same lessons. First of which was - profitability is fundamental."
4,Got My Attention,"I saw three members from ""The Mystic Warriors"" preforming live at an arts and craft show in Letchworth State Park in NY. State this summer (2009) and was quite impressed with their music. When I returned home I checked their web site only to be more impressed by their accomplishments shown there. I purchased this CD and listen to it frequently. The music is soothing and relaxing. Just what you need after a long day at the office. You won't be disappointed with music from ""The Mystic Warriors""."
4,campy entertainment,i liked demons but this one demons2 was a tad better. taking place in an apartment building it is funny and horrific combined. demons takes place in a movie theater and is also worth watching.
5,Sweet Horror,Old horror movies never get old :) Baught these for my brother for his birthday and amozon was amazing with the payment address not interfearing with his mailing address. he got them no problem as predicted. hard to put a smile on his face but it did lol.
2,A huge letdown,Demons 2 is standard sequel to a good horror film. The film pretty much follows the first film's plot but this time it's a TV broadcast instead of a movie. Some of the same cast is even back and the flying baby demon talk about funny.
1,Junk,"Here is the link to the product [...]Don't waste your time with this item its a piece of junk. When its supposed to be closed water just squirts out of it. You cannot adjust it to do a solid stream, does not mist or anything. I was so disgusted I just threw it away. The engineering on this is terrible there should of been some sort of QA done prior to selling it. Another example of a chinese garbage product."
5,Love it!!!!,"By far the best straightner i have ever purchased i have thick curly hair and wow after i use this my hair is silky smooth, the price is very low for this product it is amazing. i brought one in the mall that cost over 100 dollars and it does not even get warm. this is the best. love love love."
2,Remington Straighening Iron S-8000.,"The straightener works ok. It straightens my hair better when it is dry. I have very course hair. I still had to blow dry it to get it to straighten out, and go over it a few times to really make it straight. The remington is to thick, so you can not style the hair at all with it. The worst part about this particular straightener is when I leave it plugged in and have it shut off it keeps making a beeping sound?? I have to unplug it to make it stop. I just bought a chai straightner for about three times the cost of this, it is only 1 inch thick so it styles the hair very nice, but it straightens my hair the same as the remington. I have only had it a few weeks, so I am intrested to see if the chai causes less damage as it claims then other straighteners."
1,damages hair WAY TOO MUCH,"this product (like any other) works well on really healthy, thick asian hair (which is why i even gave it a star at all). If you were to have dry, or thin, or curly hair, it will damage your hair A LOT. I used it constantly, and until i STOPPED using it for two weeks, i realized how damaged my hair was before from using it. If you were to use this product on your hair while it's wet, it damages it A LOT for ALL hair types. I used to have a revlon ceramic straightener and it is about the same price as this, and it worked really well, considering it's price. The ceramic on this straightener is VERY bad quality and it isn't worth your money. I would NEVER even consider using this in a salon. I would recommend a Revlon straightener because out of all of the different brands i've used, it works and is the least damaging to my hair, because of the better quality ceramic.dont' get remington, cause this product bites.this product bites."
2,Get what you pay for,"I bought this straightener a week ago and the plates are already chipping. It doesn't straighten hair that good, I have to keep going over it about 3 times. My hair gets caught in the plates and rips my hair out. The buttons are a little hard to push to get the heat to go up or down. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Want sleek hair? Get this iron!,"I have frizzy, kinky, half hispanic hair, and the only time I could ever get that perfectly sleek, frizz-free look was when I got my hair done at the salon. This product changes that, and I am beyond impressed. People at work want to touch my hair all the time because it looks so silky and smooth. To save time, I wash my hair at night and sleep on it wet, so that it only takes one or two 'swipes' to dry each section in the morning. I've actually straightened my hair right before going to bed, slept on my freshly-ironed hair, and there were NO kinks or 'folds' in it the next morning. I'm telling you, this iron is amazing."
2,"Hey, is this thing on???","I have very thick and coarse hair, and I thought I could save a step by using this to dry and staighten my hair. I had it on the highest setting and it took me 15 min. to dry just one section by my face! Forget about the back, I'm not sure I'd be able to reach back there and hold it long enough to dry. Finally, I blow-dried my hair and used it as a flatiron, and it did a ""fair"" job. Maybe if you have fine or thinner hair this will be good, but not if you have thick and coarse hair."
4,An overall good product,"I bought this to be able to save time drying my hair and then straightening it. However, I found it took too long using this flat iron to really dry my hair, even though it's fairly short and only slightly wavy. It works ok on damp hair, though. I like at least being able to use it on damp hair. I did find it heavier and bulkier than other models (that only work on dry hair). Something about the design has caused me to burn my fingers a couple of times, something that never happened with my old flat iron. Overall, however, the model does deliver, straightening damp or dry hair, being able to control the temperature depending on your hair. I have found it very important to use some kind of creme or oil or silicone before using, as it's continued use leads to very dry, even fly-away hair."
5,Love it..!!,"I have curly hair and it's a mess to straighten them...but this thing works like magic for me...The best feature is that you dnt need a dryer to dry your hair first and then straight..!! you can easily select the optio ""wet to dry"" all in all just love it..!!"
5,Try this before spending a fortune!!,"I'm one of the many that have tried everything under the sun to straighten my hair. I have thick, wavy hair well past my shoulders and this iron ROCKS! A long time ago, I tried a $200 wet/dry flat iron and hated it so much, I swore I'd never buy one. But after years of blow drying and straightening (with my $150 CHI, which I love) I really wanted to cut down on time. I was ready to spend a lot, but I read the reviews for the Remington and thought since they were so good, I'd try it first. I am SO glad I did. It's fairly new, so time will tell how well it holds up, but it works GREAT! I love that I've saved myself a good deal of money and my prep time for doing my hair has been cut in half. YAY!"
2,I both love it and hate it,"I got this and it straightned my hair beautifully. After like 3 minutes, it was not heating up and was constantly turning off.. While chatting with an Amazon, representative it began to work again. I'm not sure about this straightner."
4,Good tool,I love that this eliminates the need to blow dry. it does everything it says. I'm still working with it and haven't mastered it yet.
1,Broke on first use,"I purchased this item from Amazon: new, unopened package.I used it for 5 minutes, and the heating element stopped working.It is definitely broken--almost instantly upon opening it :("
5,Great for the price,"I've used a ridiculously more expensive straightener before, and this one almost compares. It is called the ""Wet to Straight"" but you can't perfectly straighten hair right out of the shower. It does however, straighten my hair [thick and wavy] very well even if it's very humid and some what wet, although not when it's fully wet. I give it a 5 star because it really does do justice for this price. I don't think I would ever use something else. It's durable and can heat up to 420 degrees which is good. I highly recommend this straightener for something thats cheap and works really well."
2,My hands shouldn't take this much abuse from a straighener!,I have very thick long hair that tends to be on the wavy to semi curly side. I used this to straighten my hair after a shower recently and it did a great job on the first section but after about 10 minutes the iron becomes heavy and the ergonomic design isn't very comfortable in my opinion. The places where you place your finger and thumbs have hard grips instead of an indent and so after straightening for 30 minutes I had lines on all the fingers that touched that part not to mention the steam gets pretty close to your skin and turns it red. Generally I allow my 10 year old to straighten her own hair but I think I might rethink it with this iron. It also made the remainder of my hair very frizzy for a straightener so I had to go back a second time (an additional 30 minutes) to get it the way my last straightener did.
1,splint ends,"I used this straightener for a few weeks, as well as a heat protector from Aveda salon. I did achieve super straight hair, however, now I'm left with a ton of split ends. Going back to using my regular hair straigtener."
4,Works on Dry Hair,"To put it simply you are better off drying your hair first. I have thick curly hair and since I am lazy I tried using this thing while my hair was still wet. It certainly dried it after running it through a lot but it didn't really straighten it... When my hair IS dry it gets the job done quickly which is really nice. I don't like to spend a lot of time on my hair, especially in the morning."
4,"Good, but could be better!","Cons: The WWAN does not have a sim-card module, and GPRS service is available only through Sprint. I had to buy an EDGE PCMCIA card to be able to connect via my own mobile operator, comes with many applications installed (which I do not need) and you can't make a clean XP Pro installation, you have to unistall them one by one.Pros: Thank goodness it comes with XP Pro, extremely light and perfect for those who need to be online everywhere they go, seems more solid than my previous Vaio (VGN-T350P), has all the ports I need (SD, MS, 2xUSB etc.), battery lasts up to 10 hours, comes with 2GB memory installed.All in all, it is a good machine if you want a light and small laptop, but DO NOT UPGRADE TO VISTA. Intel Core Solo processors in these tiny Vaio's can not handle Vista. It will take hours just to open MS Word!!"
4,Satisfied Customer,I have had the Zen Neeon for some considerable time now and the MP3 player works extremely well. The wheel control takes a little getting used to and a search feature would be very useful. So you have to organize your songs in folders before up loading. The best way to load I have found is by dragging and dropping directly from Windows.
1,Do not waste your time.,"Don't waste your time on this one, you will just end up sending it back in a few weeks.*First of all, you cannot fit anywhere near 2500 songs on this, unless you like your WMAs in the lowest grade format. This is even worse when you consider that you can pay only $70 dollars more for the Zen Touch and get EIGHT TIMES the storage.*The navigation control is HORRIBLE. It's very temperamental and cheap feeling.*If you're looking for an mp3 player to randomize all your songs, this DEFINITELY isn't the right one for you. It picks ONE way to randomize all your songs, and plays them that way forever.I have yet to see how creative is going to handle my refund. They better be quick about it!"
1,nothing more than a solely author-biased research project,very poor material. do not recommend this one as there are many other very good books out there...such as Divorce Poison. Don't waste your money on Burril's book.
4,Study Exam Guide,"Passed CIW exam 1D0-420 & 1D0-425 scoring 90% for each.I found the book very easy to read & a concise Study Guide (at times maybe TOO concise). The Site Design-Part 1, covered all the exam objectives with good explanations. However I felt that the E-Commerce - Part II, fell short of covering 2 aspects of the exam objectives, namely Catelog Design & relating OPI-OBI standards.All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone striving to pass the above CIW exams."
1,JUNK!!!,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK. As another reported, batteries are too big and do NOT FIT into many devices correctly. 3rd or 4th time I used the charger it significantly overheated and I believe would have caused a fire. I threw the whole mess in the garbage where it belongs. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK OR ASSOCIATED CHARGIN DEVICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,it's ok,"the video is ok, as far as an Idea about yoga, in the description it sais it gethers openion fro any well known swais fro all over andia.......wrong.....there's only two known swais, the rest are yongsters beginners or soeties just anyone in the streets get asked there openion about yoga.too uch oney for a ediocre product like this one."
1,Wedding Cakes by Kathleen Hackett,"""Wedding Cakes"" first of all I thought I got the wrong book, the cover does not match the same book shown for that title. Being a person who does wedding cakes for a living, I was truly disappointed with the quality of cakes shown(very amateur)."
3,Review,"The book was very fun to read but my copy was horribly abused. Besides that, it is really interesting and I won't ruin the poem~ Read the summary to know what the base of the poem is. It is about two birds arguing. It can get annoying at times but when your finish really thing about it. Our class discussion in class was interesting. Who REALLY won at the end?"
1,Misleading cover photo,"If you are interested in learning more about the beautiful structure pictured on the cover of this book, don't bother buying this book. The book provides no additional photos and only two pages of text that covers this structure at a high level - and no similar structures are covered either. Obviously these two pages were tacked on in one of the recent editions. I feel cheated.Buy the much better ""Earthbag Building: The Tools, Tricks and Techniques (Natural Building Series)"" by Hunter and Kiffmeyer instead."
5,Great Book,This book goes in to detail of every step. some neat designs to get your creative juices flowing. Highly Recomended
2,hmm....confused,I'm not a math whiz & to be able to build these houses. I said never mind & put the book down. There has to be something simpler.
5,So Glad This Brush is Still Around!,"I used this brush for over 10yrs, until it finally broke (I think my husband had something to do with it). I found this brush is still floating around and was very happy! When I originally bought it in a salon, it was very expensive, however on amazon this brush is super affordable. The quality is there, and is an overall perfect brush! The handle is comfortable, and brush head is a bit flexable so it won't yank hair, plus the anti-static feature is good for keeping hair smooth. Must have brush!"
3,Atlantis is Okay,"This is way overpriced. You can get it at Walmart for about $130. We have used it on our carpets, which did a good job. It took me over an hour to clean our 10x10 tile floor, which came out about average. Like another reviewer, the machine leaked after I used it about 5 times. There has to be better machine out there."
5,Well written...,"...and it held my interest. Once you get used to Mr. Eddy's style (and the fact that he is writing English...not 'Murrican) it moves right along. Another reviewer said one wouldn't warm to the Flint character. Perhaps so, but I wouldn't turn my back to her either."
4,The Babysitter 3,"Jenny can't stop thinking about Mr. Hagens and that he tried to kill her. Even though he fell off a cliff and died she still sees he everywhere. The docter says she getting better, but with all the nightmares and visions she doesn't think so. She finally quit being a babysitter, but nothing changes. After a while her parents send her to her cousin Debra. At first, things get a little better, but then alot worse. Because, Debra got a new job, babysitting. When Jenny found out, she totally freaked. When Debra decides to bring Jenny along, Jenny's mind explouds with horrible thoughts. Mr. Hagens finally takes over her. It's a whole new ball game for Debra when the baby is kidnapped, and she recieves a frightening phonecall. I thought this book was great. There were creepy and scary events plus a mystery too"
3,not what i expected,"I bought this for my gerbil tank. I didn't read the description close enough though, I was expecting aspen wood chips. The gerbils seem to like it just fine but they can't burrow in it. My main reason for buying this off Amazon was bc Walmart was out for some reason. I won't buy it again, will use up what I have."
5,Rock Out and Dance at the Same Time!,I'm listening to this RIGHT NOW and this CD is AMAZING! Love the rock beats with pop sensibilities. You can head bang and dance at the same time!
4,Most original CD of 2005,"Ok, maybe not quite, but certainly up there. What if the Rave bunnies & Rockers could get together & have fun on the same dance floor?? Spin this & see what happens. Really cool live guitars with programmed drums. Nice."
2,meh.,"I really wanted to like this album, a good friend of mine went nuts for it and made me give it at least one listen all the way through. Bodyrockers is reminiscent of older 80s & 90s bands like the other reviewers have been pointing out, for sure. The lead singer from Love and Rockets I think had some influence here, and Michael Hutchence too. Not sure if I spelled that right but it doesn't matter, because ultimately my opinion is that the CD isn't worth too much pondering. The tracks for the most part just sound like generic dance beats with way too much computerization (for my tastes anyway, I'm not into electronica.) I much prefer the sound of bands that make their music using actual instruments. So this was lost on me."
1,Failed!,"I have to agree with the first reviewer - this is the worst drive I have had in terms of reliability. It failed after only a few months of operation. Luckily, it was part of a mirrored RAID set and the other drive is still functioning perfectly. Recommend you avoid this drive."
4,Well Designed Solid Product,"It was a last minute decision to get a Quaker Parrot for xmas and I found this cage on Amazon. It was a better price than any comperable cage I could find - not to mention that I received it the very next day after I ordered it with free prime shipping. The directions were not the best so I take a star away, but it went together very easily and is well designed. No regrets on this one and I recommend it."
5,Prevue Cage,"I bought this cage for my Quaker parrot. It is fantastic! Arrived in one day, packaging was excellent, the corners were all reinforced on the box and it was all banded. Inside everything was bubble wrapped and banded together, it was in perfect condition. I was a little worried because I had read that it was difficult to put together and the instructions were bad. I had no problem at all, did it completely alone and the instructions were fine. It took me from removing from the box to finish about an hour. The cage itself is beautiful! And so well constructed! My Quaker took right to it, climbing and inspecting it as I was putting it together. She slept in it the first night. Don't be shy about purchasing this cage, you will love it. There is room for birds up to an African grey size. My little quaker has tons of room! I have no negatives to say about it."
3,Disappointed that I Couldn't Return,"We didn't take this out of the package, because my daughter had purchased another wig just like it. Sadly we couldn't return due to the ""no returns on costume"" policy. I wish you could return stuff that hadn't even been opened."
2,2-dimensional disapointment,"I can sum this up in one sentence: Flat, easily breakable piece you'd expect from a grocery store vending machine."
3,a constant preformer,We've had our Krups Arome Time for going on 8 years with one carafe replacement. It was recommended to me by a Krups Corp employee as her favorite. Unlike other posting here we had no trouble getting our replacement carafe- Krups sent in out within the week. Although now it is starting to throw grounds into the water and doesn't always perk completely (have no idea why -it perks about 3 cups then the water all sits in the filter) so I think it's finally ready for retirement. I will definetely buy another one.
2,How Slow Can It Go??,"I bought this coffee maker 2 years ago and liked the design & the ability to have the coffee brew automatically. BUT, it took a month of sundays to brew my daily 2 cups, and one could grow, pick & grind fresh coffee beans before you'd get a whole pot of coffee for company. I was disappointed thinking the Krups brand would be a good investment and would get several years out of a very expensive coffee maker."
3,Good coffee...cheap plastic,Other reviewers have complained about the carafe. We just broke our first after one year of use. That's pretty average for our family.My complaint is with the all-plastic construction of the coffee maker. The lid you must open each time to fill the water and coffee grounds is made of plastic. One hinge snapped off within the first week of use. The unit has continued to make very good coffee but for this price they should use better quality materials.
2,Carafe is way too fragile!,"Overall it's a decent coffee maker. I don't have the dribble problems reported here, and replacing the carafe in the correct position is a no-brainer (it only fits in one way).My beef with it is that the carafe is extraordinarily touchy. Just bump it the wrong way on the edge of your coffee cup, counter, etc. and the bottom will shatter out.If you own it, be extra careful with the carafe (unless you like wearing coffee), otherwise look for a machine with a better built carafe."
2,"2 & 1/2 stars; rather pleasant, but uninspiring","While this novel occasionally peaked reader interest and maintained a fairly steady pace, it is not very romantic and deals much more with the setting of the romance--the war and its environs--than with the actual romance of the main characters. Indeed, much of the book is about Rachel and her ne'er-do-well husband. The idea that the scandals surrounding Rachel can be so easily put aside is preposterous; she may be a victim, but the result remains. Jacob is a nice man, but does jump off the page. In fact, the whole book is rather mundane, due in large part to the extensive narration of wartime events.And the title has nothing to do with the story."
1,Far Fetched Approach to Packing a Healthy Lunch,"I did not find this book to be helpful at all. Ideas seemed too far fetched and complicated, especially if you have a picky child. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Big Disappointment,"I was hoping for much more useful info on this one. I did like the checklist that allowed you to ""interview"" your child about what they like, don't like and are willing to try. Other than that there was not an original thought or edible recipe inside. It just takes up space on my bookshelf!"
5,Please Don't Call My Mother,"The best book on the subject I've ever read! I'm a parent of 3 sons who was always involved in their schools. Mr. Lazares' book is brimming with common sense. It is also insightful and hits it's mark. It is a positive approach to discipline in the schools but also to parenting, teaching and administration. I wish everyone in the education system could read this book. Easy and fast read."
5,"Clean dishes, convenient, neat","These are so expensive at the store so I was glad to see Amazon had these at a such a great price. My dishes always come out clean and I love the convenience of just throwing one of these in and then running the dishwasher. It's so much neater than liquids and powders. I also like the fact that I only have to think about buying these a few times a year and I'm set. When I used to run it might take me three days to get to the store, so the I love the convenience of ordering 100 Actions Pacs at a time and getting them delivered right to my front door."
1,Terrible,"I purchached these from Amazon based on the rave reviews. Now my dishes & pans come out with spots & food stuck on them. Even my oatmeal bowl comes out with cinnamon stains on it! The gel always worked fine & I should have stuck with that. The worst thing is - I called Cascade to complain (which I NEVER do) & they will only replace TWO of the packages with Gel. If you are someone that usually washes their dishes by hand before putting them in the dish washer, these are for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
4,Mixed Feelings,"A woman brought this book to my breast cancer support group last night and I went home and read it in one sitting. It IS laugh-out-loud funny. Many of the author's comments were exact duplicates of things I've said during my own cancer treatment, and I'm sure any woman going through breast cancer treatment will recognize herself in at least one of the comics. It gave me a good feeling to see my experience in the pages of this book. I would give this book five stars if it were not for the sad ending -- the recurrence (and progression) of the author's cancer. All of us going through cancer treatment, or just finishing, know that this possibility looms in our future. But if you don't want to be reminded of it, this book is probably not for you."
5,I've been there...,"This is a 'must read' for anyone with, or closely involved with, someone who has breast cancer. You will laugh and laugh and recognize events and interactions familiar to anyone who goes through the diagnosis and treatment. The book makes a great gift!"
4,Dark but Funny,"This book really made me laugh when I had breast cancer, but there is no question that it is not for everyone. The humor is very dark. The seller was great."
2,It was great until the warranty period was up!,"We bought this coffee maker after having a horrible experience with the now-discontinued Kitchenaid coffee maker we received as a wedding gift. This morning my husband got up - came back to bed and told me the coffee maker wasn't working. I got up, unplugged it, replugged it - hit all of the buttons, etc. NOTHING. I came to Amazon to read other people's reviews to see if they had similar problems. Apparently this is not an isolated incident! Unfortunately, we bought this coffee maker one year ago - pretty much to the day - and of course I can't find my receipt. It's going in the garbage tonight and we're buying a new one tomorrow! Maybe we'll buy eight $10 coffee makers for the same price, so when one of them poops out, we have back ups!"
2,Poor design of pot,"I had this coffee pot for a few months and had a terrible time with leakage when pouring coffee. Then we received a different krups (with espresso attachment) and it leaks also. I wish I would have kept my old Mr Coffee which poured fine.On the upside, both did make coffee fine."
1,DO NOT BUY NO MATTER WHAT!!!!,"This coffeemaker costs A LOT -- you are better off going to Kmart and spending $11 on the cheapest one you can find. That's what we had to do when this one broke down after ONE MONTH of use. We got it repaired under warantee, it worked for ONE MORE MONTH, and guess what: the cheap-ie is back out because this one is broken AGAIN. Krups won't replace it until it breaks down YET AGAIN so I guess I'd better hold onto that cheapie (a Proctor-Silex, BTW) for round 3. DO NOT BUY THIS -- YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!!"
5,Easy to use and reliable,We got this machine for a wedding gift two years ago and it is still going strong. It is very intuitive and easy to use (I have never had to read the manual) and it makes a great cup of coffee (I use filtered water and do not use the carbon filter). I especially like the option of setting it 1-4 cups for when you make a smaller pot of coffee. I have not had a problem with the carafe dribbling although I pour agressively. It is a workhorse and I highly recommend it.
2,Not for the gormet coffee lover,"I received this coffee maker as a wedding gift three years ago in September.The good: It's pretty and looks good on your counter top. It has a clock.The bad: You have to use course ground coffee if you don't want mud on the bottom of your cup. The filter just isn't designed for finer ground coffee. To have a decent tasting cup of coffee you should use filtered water. If you don't, you have to replace the carbon filters all the time (and by the way replacement filters aren't cheap). Finally a month before our third aniversary the whole thing quit working. I filled it up with coffee and water, turned it on and nothing happened (by the way we had company-great timing). It cost more to fix the darned thing than to just buy a new one. So in conclusion, if you like weaker coffee and you don't mind buying a new machine every three years, then this is the coffee maker for you."
1,misleading -- not worth reading,"I live in New York City and my life has been changed dramatically by 911. The sensational title attracted my attention and I bought a copy. I am, however, quite disappointed by the fact that the book is written based on more speculation and imagination than actual facts. China is by no means an US ally, but far from an enemy either. I travelled to China a couple of times, and Chinese are friendly people. I don't think the Chinese government is stupid enough to provoke a war with US, given US military's superiority and that they have enough headache dealing with a huge unemployed population (in the order of 10millions). The cover picture with burning twin towers might be quite effective (at least for people like me that has been changed deeply by 911) in getting people's attention, but all I can say is that it's a good commercial. Read the book with your brain, not your eyes."
2,This books intends to demonize china,"With technologies advancing farther, weapons are becoming much much powerful. We will reach a day when a single evil person could destroy a country. This book tells big powers should never do mean things to small and poor country. They would have a way to revenge one day.The title of this book intend to demonize China for the purpose of creating hatred. Otherwise a good book."
1,It's so funny that so many readers have such over reaction,"1. It's just a BOOK written by some people who have their own thoughts, normal or crazy, how could one say it represent a nation? a government? Do you have mental or psychological problem?2. If it is true that the Bible predicts the two World Wars, does this mean that the God is the one who should be blamed?3. There were(are) many crazy thoughts and personels in the US as well, do they also represent the whole nation and the government? obviously nonesense!4. If someone diliberately want to mislead public, it is very, very bad any dangerous!"
4,sophisticated elegant dinning for lunch or light dinner,"This wonderful book contains a wide variety of sophisticated recipes for making the midday meal & is a great experience in elegant dining. It also makes the preparation easier than you would imagine.The book starts out with an explanation of ingredients, & terms as well as some helpful tips. There are over 40 complete lunches for all occasions. Many varieties of salads, soups, seafood & pasta are presented.Most meals quite large. Most contain a main dish, vegetable, & dessert. Conveniently, all recipes list preparation & cooking time with ideas for preparing ahead. Whether the recipe can be doubled, halved, or frozen is also mentioned.Some of my favorite dishes include the beef-filled mushrooms, french onion soup, & crab quiche. Most meals would also make a great light dinner."
3,GREAT Show--but why Edited Episodes???,"I can't state how much I LOVE ""W&G"" as a show, and, sure having all seasons/episodes on DVD is wonderful, but, these episodes are edited and are the syndicated versions. Not a huge problem, but, some of the funniest lines/parts of certain episodes are actually missing. For example, where's the classic meeting between Madonna and Jack???? I was looking forward to that scene, and, it was MISSING!!!!"
4,Will and Grace Season 5,Really funny. Sometimes touching. The excellent cast and writers deliver great entertainment in almost every episode.
1,Season Five = Total Dissapointment,"I can't believe the episodes are all clipped. We waited over a year for... this? I am a huge fan, but this is not the best season, maybe too many deleted scenes actually DO make a difference.What really surprises me... are all those people giving 5 stars!"
2,"For $34, check out her website first and have a listen before buying","Sorry, didnt like this CD. Not necessarily my type of music I guess. I would definitely recommend listening to it on Lisa Chappells website before buying it, considering that it costs a whopping $34, which to me is very expensive for a music CD.For any Mcleod's Daughters fans out there that are curious about this album because of a Claire's-death-induced-depression, I recommend that you preview the album. It will snap you back into reality and get you over season 3 of mcleods daughters in a jiffy. (not kidding, this is exactly what my mother recommended when I got to the end of season 3----she said ""It's practically like grieving, here, this will snap you out of it"", handing me the CD)She does have a beautiful voice, though."
4,This book rules!,"This book is fabulous, and it is worth my time to email the author, as she requests. Please provide the email address for her fans."
2,Comments on Scientist's guide to Poster Presentations,"I waste my time and money buying this book, I found it no useful to my research activites. It does not give practical recommendations, it does not offer good examples on poster designing and it is obsolete, it is not completly clear on something basic like the dimensions of a poster."
4,Very useful,"Out of the four (4) 'required' texts assigned for my graduate literacy class, this is by far the most useful. The literacy strategies described in the text were easy to read and understand, and will be very useful in the classroom. I keep this textbook for future use."
1,Dewalt square bits,"Bought these along with a dewalt 3/8 18 volt impact to install 1/2"" cement board , almost all of them broke when driving the screws, luckily I had a10 pack so I could finish the job , bought a 25 pack of the ace hardware brand, which I didn't expect to be any better, but none broke on the next job and seem to be a better quality or harder metal. Would not recommend."
5,Jesus is Not Safe!,"from the back cover:Jesus is Not Safe, but He is SATISFYING!Each of us has a restlessness, an inconsolable longing within. Some try to satisfy it with scenic vacations, creative accomplishments, huge cinematic productions, sexual exploits, sports extravaganzas, hallucinogenic drugs, ascetic rigors, managerial excellence, and more.Yet our longing remains.Why?John Piper turns your heart toward the one true Object of human desire - God.He shows how fulfilling your duty to delight in Him can change your attitude toward worship, toward marriage, toward material goods, toward your very mission and purpose on earth! Join him on a journey from desperate desire to infinite delight!'Our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee.' --Saint Augustine"
2,Why is it called Karaoke?,"This CD has some great songs, but because it is not a CD&G, the lyrics do not appear on the screen."
1,Don't Bother!,"Bought from Amazon, paid for expedited shipping. Had high hopes but they were quickly dashed. From even a few inches or feet away it was extremely unreliable. A waste of money. Amazon makes it easy to return, which I already have done, but thanks to this waste of time and engineering I'm out the shipping cost. Worthless, worthless, worthless."
2,No Bluetooth,Wow a big name like Monster doesn't use Bluetooth? I just do not get why you would want a dongle sticking out of your device.
3,"Neat toy, goes through batteries too quickly.","Very functional for what its intended for, but the battery dies quickly, so turn it off when you're not adjusting anything and it may last a bit longer."
1,EZClick,The remote was simple to install. The unit does NOT function very well with the Ipod classic. It takes several button presses to get the ipod to respond. I would not recommend this remote.
3,"Good Product, Not Great",I brought this item only for when I go snowboarding. It worked fine at for the first couple of minutes. But after I was riding for a while it stopped responding. It started working again once it was warm again.
3,"Wonderful seller, crapy product","Unfortunately for the sender, this remote wasn't so great. It's in need of batteries already and only after riding with it 2 times. When it works though, it works great."
1,Does not work with my 3rd gen Nano,"I intended to use this product to control my 3rd gen Nano while motorcycling. It does not work. If you press the up volume button, it moves the volume to max. If you press down volume, it moves the volume to min. There is no way to increase or decrease volume with this device! I tried pairing it as per the instructions, but it made no difference. Also, you cannot skip a song. Pressing the forward button fast forwards through the song instead of skipping to the next song. I don't know about other iPods, but if you have a 3rd gen Nano, this product does not work at all."
4,Great product but buggy,"I bought this remote for my stereo cooler and the concept is great but Monster has not quiet perfected their product. You have to push the buttons multiple times for your iPod to register and react. The iJet is a much better product but more expensive. If you can afford the iJet get it, otherwise this one will work"
1,No Range,"The wireless has no range. I literally have to hold the ipod against the remote to get it to work, even after I put in a fresh battery. A complete waste of money."
5,Ipod remote,"I bought the Ipod remote to use while riding my motorcycle. It works great and am really impressed. The only complaint I could think of is when I wear my heavy cold weather gloves, It is is hard to change tracks and raise or lower the volume. It works great with my lighter weight gloves. I do like it and recommend it to anyone."
3,not so bad,"i ordered this one for my husband and it is not compatible with the ipod nano; you cannot plug in the remote sensor and headphones at the same time. the remote i ordered didn't work, so i inherited this one. i was none too happy because i've read terrible product reviews. however, in light of my low expectations, i find that it is not so bad. i primarily use it for snowboarding and it is a bit of a pain in the ass to use the buttons with gloves on because you have to press them hard. i followed the suggestions in other reviews and avoided using the wrist strap, and found it doubly hard to press the buttons through a pocket. i think it would be just fine for any other occasion though. i also recommend somehow attaching a key ring of some sort to the remote so it can be attached on the outside of your coat or pants when snowboarding."
4,Works fine - great value,"I bought this for use on my motorcycle, just in time for a long trip from San Francisco to Seattle. I took the advice of previous reviews and replaced the battery right away. It worked great for the whole trip. Occasionally I had to make a few stabs at the button to get the change I wanted, being careful to keep my eyes on the road as much as possible. A minor design issue given the price--there was no problem in actual functionality. Overall a great value and a good product. Apparently it is discontinued a year or more ago (which is why the stock battery needs replacing), so get'em while they last! I'm not aware of another alternative at anything near this price, and I wouldn't have paid the higher prices that are being charged for similar products."
5,Great for all ages,Easy to read and start conversations on feelings and situations dealing with death. I would use for children of all ages.
4,the long book about a white con,"This book is a slow read. After reading white folks several years back, i was quite excited to run across this book. i expected this book to pick up where the last left off, it hardly does so, and it barely tells a story worth telling.Too many loose ends in this book. However due to my soft spot for the author it has earned 4 count em 4 stars. I recommend reading dope fiend or mama black widow, truly entertaining and distrubing at the same time, if thats at all possible."
3,"decent fan, easy to install","we have two small rooms off our bedroom, a walk-in closet and an office, and neither has heating or cooling. installed this fan between them to create circulation and it works great, pulling heated or cooled air into one room, through the wall to the other, and pushing it back out into the bedroom. adjustable speed is nice. gave it 3 stars because would be nice if the fan was a bit quieter at high speed."
4,Essential Foundation Reading for Native American Fine Art,"This is a great survey of Native American contemporary fine art, with an excellent range of views in the artists' word. The issues raised by the artists are still very much in play today."
4,Great reade,Most enjoyable read for baseball fans. Although Kaiser has a small chip on his shoulder due to the actions surrounding his dismissal he still comes through w/great stories.
3,informed with a bias,"Alvin Jennings though well informed on various churches gives a Campbellite view or perspective on each church. Anyone wanting to learn how he applies the Word of God should read "" Campbellism Its History and Heresies"" by Bob Ross."
1,Judgmental and disappointing,"This is a typical Church of Christ book that lists all the denominations and explains why they are wrong and the Church of Christ is the one true faith. Jennings has a feeble understanding of these faiths. He twists the Bible to make it seem to condemn these faiths and support his own. If you want an intelligent evaluation of various denominations, look for something more objective."
5,Olivia Newton-John In Concert,"Olivia In ConcertThis is a must have for any Olivia fan.You see Olivia performing at her peak in the '80s.She is so full of energy and shows why she is so loved all around the world.Why they didn't release this on dvd is beyond me.The song listing is very good, sort of a greatest hits.Any Olivia fan will truly be happy with this concert video."
2,Disappointed,Hard to finish - sadly. I wait with held breath for each new Jayne Ann Krentz book to appear. And then I found this one. I still haven't finished it - unfortunately it had put me off reading for awhile. Quick - someone hand me the new Amanda Quick novel!
3,Lets be realistic,"Lets be realistic, this is an average fantasy novel with dragons. The characters are descent and the epic feeling that one comes to expect from fantasy is descent. There are some let downs, namely the romance parts are a bit much for my taste. There is also name choices that are odd, particularly 'tambootie' which just comes off as goofy. Overall it's an average book and reading it is equal to watching some basic television show.Consider how much you pay for this book. I payed very little picking up a copy at a thrift store for about 50 cents. It took me about a week to read and overall the entertainment value I received was worth my 50 cents. Overall I would pay upwards of 2 dollars for this book, but no more.Also as an after thought, I found it necessary to pick up the rest of the trilogy to complete the story. Thus it was compelling enough to make me at least want to find out what happens in the end."
1,Romance or Fantasy?,"I am an avid fantasy reader. I picked up her first Nimbus series and read the Glass Dragon hoping to have found another author. It reads more like a romance novel - concerned with the ""love"" that is felt between the three characters. You get tired of reading those passages and wish it would get back to fantasy. The aspect that made me lose interest in reading additional books was that she wrote about mostly male characters but did not come close to capturing their reactions to situation throughout the book. In fantasy, when you are attacked someone dies. The only death occurs as a report from some distant portion of the kingdom. That is it. The magicians, villain, soldiers, heroes even fight but stop with with no more than a small cut taking place.This book lacks the action of a fantasy book set in world of magic and sword play."
3,A mediocre book.,"I wasn't able to fully identify with the characters in the story. Their personalities are not very well developed and are all fairly similar.On the positive side, some elements of the story have me intrigued. For example, I'd like to know more about Nimbulan's reasons for wanting everyone to use only dragon magic. I'd also like to know more about the effects of the Tambootie trees. Maybe I'll find some of the answers in the next two books, or in the Dragon Nimbus History series.Overall, this book was worth the read but it doesn't really stand out from the other fantasy novels out there."
3,Very (too?) brief.,"It's a short dvd which creates ""awareness"" about Baroque, Rococo and Neo Classicsm. Baroque is only mentioned as the previous step of Rococo and Neo Classicsm is introduced as the next step. Other than that, there are some fine examples of Rococo style. At the end of the documentary, it arouses interest in you to search for more to learn more. From that perspective it is a nice study. But in order to be able to say that you learned what Rococo is all about through this dvd, well, it's too short."
5,Painfully beautiful!!!,"Just breath taking. Not only Fabio biondi excuted music beautifully, but also he telled the drama."
3,hokey,"This series is okay for basic info, but the production quality is starved for cash. Not for use if your institution has an art history major (you'll want something a bit newer and academic), but okay for high school, college art appreciation, and community college."
3,Didn't work for us...,"I had heard so many wonderful things about this blanket. I guess I really thought it would be a miracle for those sleepless nights! My daughter really resisted being put in this blanket (and always found a way to get her feet out) and although after a few weeks she came to not mind it as much, I could never convince my husband or other babysitters to use it. They thought it was too complicated and extremely restrictive. Not using it consistently, she began to resist it even more. So now....it sits in our closet unused."
4,Smooth,"I dig this album because it has a variety of smooth jams that you can play on and on. My favorite one's were ""boogie philosophy"", ""Nonsensical Thing"", ""hell alright"", and ""dancing with my hands"". But my favorite was ""It will turn out right"". The other's were mello and had a cool feel to them like ""My Society"" and ""Better World"""
1,RIP OFF,This vacuum is a rip off why didn't I read about it on consumer reports before!!!! All I can say is BE SURE TO BUY THE WARRANTY if you get sucked in!!! It is a piece of junk!! Literally fell apart in 2 years! And if you have hard wood forget it! I am ired of puching around bit is cat food on the floors!!!
5,Housekeeper recommends Dyson Animal,"I clean homes for a living and use many different types of vacs. But last year, for my own home, I purchased the purple Animal Dyson and find it superior. Many uprights scatter dirt on bare floors, but not this one and it's cleaner than using a broom. We have a dog with long hair and a cat and I'm no longer frustrated with pet hair remaining on the carpet. I love being able to see the dirt in the resevoir and then easily empty it. It is so powerful! AND you can leave the vac at the bottom of the stairs and clean all the way to the top step. Do check the beater bar if you've long hair pets. I've had to cut off excess fur."
2,Disappointing.,"This book is full of ramblings that present Wolfe's position that Eric Ambler is not the master of intrigue that he is widely-acknowledged to be but, rather, is a somewhat mediocre aspirant to such status. In my view Wolfe largely misses the most important point of Ambler's books: they are only superficially novels of intrigue. More fundamentally they are expositions on human strength and frailty as well as human behavior, especially under stress. That Ambler is able to explore such matters so skillfully in the guise of highly-entertaining novels of suspense and intrigue is a sign of genius not mediocrity."
4,good book,"I enjoyed this part of history you seldom read about.I got the feeling, as I did with Chester A Arthur's bio that a lot of information was left to the mystery of history.That whole era, the deaths, the triumphs and tragedies, what a time.I would recommend this book as a perfect reference if you are doing what I am, reading all the presidents."
5,WOW! A great bracelet,This bracelet was exactly what I was looking for. I had been searching for months and finally found the braclet I wanted. Would buy again.
1,AWFUL AND BORING TOY!!!!,"I had floam for about 65 minutes, and it was one of the worst toys I've EVER had. It came all slimy and gross. It doesn't stick to ANYTHING! Ten minutes of squishing your finger against a wooden mirror with slimy Floam and then seeing it DROP! THE COMMERCIALS LIE!!!!!!!!! It stains carpets and clothing, it doesn't hold shape,and it SMELLS! I HIGHLY reccommend nobody buy this toy. My friends and I all bought some, and now wish we hadn't wasted 19.95! It messed up EVERYTHING!!!! :( I know it works for 5 out of 100 people, but I'm one of the 95 people who say it's HORRIBLE! Please, don't buy this product and don't become part of that 95 people!!!"
3,new formula,"I ordered this product online because it became discontinued at my local drugstore. I had been VERY impressed with it then. When I received it from Amazon, however, I noticed that it was a little different. The color and smell had obviously changed (to white and creamy). I have not been happy with the new formula, although I'm not sure exactly what is diferent about it. It just hasn't worked like it did when I was buying it before."
3,Awaiting Results,"What I like about this product is that it is not complicated. Use the medication, put the sun screen over it and be on your way. I am guessing it might take a while to see if it is effective on dark spots and blemishes. It really has not stopped break-outs. Will post again to update on results with further use."
2,Taste Horrible!,"I got these for my eight year old daughter who has just recently had two migrains over the holidays. She has complained about taking them to the point that she spit it out with the water after it had already disolved some in her mouth. I thought it was simply because she didn't like taking it until I tried it myself... ugh! It taste horrible! If you can tolerate the nasty taste, it does work. She didn't have any headaches during the short time she took it. Now that she's not taking it though, the headaches are coming back so I will be looking for another brand, maybe in capsules. We will definitely not be buying these again."
4,One of the best EBM compilations ever !,"This CD contains a lot of the best EBM songs ever made in the eighties and ninties. In my opinion this CD will be most useful for new-comers in the world of ebm, because most songs can also be found on older ebm compilations (like TV-treated, Adrenaline rush,...)My favorite songs : the live edition of ""technoman"" by And One, Rascheln by Calva Y Nada, and Andrenaline Rush by Leather Strip)."
4,bose wave music sys multi-cd changer,"cd changer was received promptly, easy to install works as advertized the color match between bose wave system base and cd changer was a match would like to see this unit sell a little cheaper with out the remote as you would already have one with the wave music system."
5,Flawless coverage & blends well,"As a guy, I like to use makeup that doesn't look like I'm wearing makeup. This foundation is the perfect solution as it blends well and leaves my skin looking clear!"
2,Retractable TAPE Leash Problem,"My husband bought the new, all tape, retractable Flexi leash last night, and this morning, first thing, our 9 month old Australian shepherd bit through it. We purchased this leash to replace our old Flexi that had served us well through several dogs, but it was getting tired and no longer retracting well. The heavy duty tape section on the old leash was not even frayed, through much chewing and biting, but the tape on these new leashes is thin and it only took one bite. As long as your dog does not bite the leash it works well, though I missed having a fixed stop as I often kept our old leash locked in that position for walking near traffic."
1,Worst leash EVER!!,"This is the worst leash! The chord is so weak and is very dangerous! My son was cut on the chord today, he's 6 years old. I was cut on the chord last week-I threw it away!! Do not buy this junk!"
1,One Major Problem!,One Major Problem! When you put a magnet in (say the apple) the refigeratorsays the WRONG item (like grapes). I contacted the company who would replace itafter I PAID to ship the item back to them... I would NOT buy this toy!
2,Another poor product from V Tech,"I bought this for my 2 kids a few months ago and they really like it. I agree that it is way too loud, it should have a volume control and of button. But my HUGE problem with this toy is that when you put the pieces in, it tells them the wrong information. For instance, when you put the milk piece in, it tells you all about the lemon, or the potato becomes a drumstick. I mean, really? And of course when I contacted V Tech about the problem they told me (after all of their ""tricks"" to reset it) that I could send it back to them AT MY COST and they would send me a replacement one. Now, why would I want to pay more money for a poorly designed toy? I have had huge problems with a lot of V Tech toys and will NOT be buying any more!!!"
2,"Should be called ""a discussion of Japanese history with small amounts of Japan""","This documentary contains very little footage of japan. In fact, what little footage there is of Japan might all be stock footage, and a number of relevant visuals are still shots that look like they were poorly scanned from photos. About 60% of the film is footage of three professors talking about Japan, there is a brief history of Japan from about 500bc to present, it moves at a fast pace and contains a couple of minor errors. The visuals are highly repetitive, there is a lot of footage of the imperial palace in Tokyo - formerly Edo Castle - although Edo castle and the imperial palace are not mentioned in the film. I thought the CGI models didn't add much to the documentary, it seems to me likely they were put in to add ""Japan content"" without the expense of going to Japan. The samurai are fairly peripheral to the documentary."
1,If you teach: do not purchase: terribly dull,My 8th graders had to be kept awake. Avoid this video at all costs.
1,Disappointment,This CD was a real disappointment. I thought it would a good meditation CD but proved not to be. I tried it a few times but found it useless. Don't waste your money on it.
5,Outstanding new author!,"Mark Fadden's excellent work is a unique twist on the traditional detective story. It is packed with details and an intricate, complex plot that will keep you glued to the page and guessing until the very last line. If you are looking for a crime novel with more guts than the average, this is your book. I look forward to further installments in this series, as well as other works by Mr. Fadden. Overall, very impressive, especially for a new face in the literary world!"
4,The Devil is in the Details,"With this first novel, Mark has introduced the amazingly complex detective, Danny Cavanaugh, in a highly descriptive tale involving murder, money, something like madness. I loved the setting in Dallas, not only because I am native Texan, but also because he takes everything we love and hate about Dallas and weaves those elements into the story. I must admit that once I got to the last 100 pages, I thought I had the ending figured out. I was wrong. Let me just say, don't start the last part of the book until you have the time to finish it, because you won't put it down!I truly look forward to learning more about Danny Cavanaugh and seeing more of Mark's writing."
2,not brotzmann's terrain,"at this session, it gets clear that brotzmann's style as a brutal free blower is kind of a one trick pony. hopkins forces him to relate to changes or at least the abstraction of changes. and at this point exactely, the limits of brotzmann's approach get clear. He fails in that. His playing is clumsy, bumpy at times, when he is forced to relate to changes. Therefore, this trio does not find it's unity.It's not brotzmann's terrain."
5,A business philosphy for life.,"The book is an interesting mix of history, philosophy, business managment, and worldly opinions.It starts with a description of life in Japan and some of the ancient customs and culture. The events of World War II as seen fromthe Japanese view point is interesting in itself. What follows then is the development of a world wide corporation with it's growthtroubles, managment style, international barriers and differnces and a sense of ""can-do"" wonder. The remainder of the book is thefoward looking views and opinions of an elder statesmen.One item that I found myself personally attached to was the theme of ""monttainai"" on page 227 and throughout the rest of thechapter. I'll leave it to you to figure out why."
5,A Book Worth Reading,"This book is written by Mr Akio Morita,the man behind the corporate giant Sony Corporation.He was a visionary and dreamer who not just dreamed but also made it possible.Let's not forget, the Sony Corporation was founded at the backdrop of nuclear attack on Japan by the United States.But he was never jealous of America.Instead he was very much influenced by the progress of US.He always tried to replicate the progress of US by closely watching the American business model.The book is full of anecdotes about the Japanese lifestyle, his thoughts on Management and his association with SONY.So,just read."
3,For Real?,"I bought this because it was an item I've used for many years - and the Amazon online price was most appealing. My concern is that in the past the color of the liquid was totally CLEAR - but this item has a slight discoloration. There is a slight ""yellowing"" of the liquid. Thus, my question: Is this the original Estee Lauder product - or could it be something else?"
5,Completes the set!,"This is the third in this series I have purchased for gifts. They make an impressive, colorful display on the office wall."
5,The Most Effective Way To Improve Your Skills,"When I first watched this DVD, I was amazed at how effective it teaches each trick. ""Soccer Tricks"" shows each move with superb depth and detail. The slow motion replays break down each skill step by step, in an easy to follow, extensive manner. In addition, the normal speed replays show the viewer how the trick should be performed at high speed, game situations.Quite simply, this is a fantastic DVD at a great value. You will not regret purchasing ""Soccer Tricks"". Whether you are looking to impress your friends with new skills, or humiliate opposing defenders in your next soccer game, this DVD is for you. This is another masterpiece from Coach Janaway."
2,Still looking...,"I once bought a pair of Me Too's that were the softest most comfortable and cute shoe I have ever owned. Since then - although I keep trying - I have never been able to find another.This sandal looks really, really cute. Very easy to dress up or down. BUT, it's narrow at the front (toes touch the ground on the side) and the leather is tough and cuts into your feet. It's the type of shoe that could only be comfortable with stockings, and this is obviously not an option due to the style."
2,Standby Loser,"Don't waste your money. After 18+ months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life. Instead of updating to a newer phone, accompanied by a new 2-year service agreement, I opted to purchase a ""new"" battery. Waste of money! The new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means I must re-charge nightly. That was the same predicament I encountered with the original battery - nightly re-charge."
4,Great rail,The kinked grind rail is an exciting variation to a normal rail. Not a beginner rail. But great for experienced riders
4,Amazing look behind the scenes!,"This is a really interesting book! I never thought much about the First Ladies before. The presidents usually get all of the attention but there is some really fascinating stuff in here.Did you know that Grover Cleveland was the only president to get married in the White House? His wife, Frances, was also the youngest first lady. I especially liked the story about how she used to conjugate Greek verbs in her head when she was stuck in a boring reception. Funny!Anyway, the book is great and it's up to date all the way through Laura Bush. I highly recommend it for any history buffs out there."
4,Helpful,"This book is a help for the newly grieving, especially a widow.Makes a nice gift for someone who has recently lost a spouse. The author wrote from her own experience; it is not the regular stages of grief."
2,"Not the best, but not the worst","This game is a big step from last years but there are alot of bad things too. Like if you run into the wall you stay down for 30 seconds while all the baserunners score. Graphics are mediocre (compared to MVP 2005). Good things are the swing stick control makes game more realistic and a little more challenging. Overall it is very fun once you get used to it, but you will be frustrated sometimes when you are getting used to it and when you get picked off at a base when you round it after a hit."
2,this game was not really good,Its was so unrealistic the computer catches every ball they dive for. its not as good as mlb the show
5,A Great Read,Investment Leadership explores why some investment organizations produce above average long-term results for clients while others don't. Jim Ware and his team discovered that the best ones have key common characteristics. Ware illustrates how an investment firm's culture influences creativity and success.This is an engaging book and I believe every investment professional would benefit from reading it. Clients will learn important characteristics to look for when hiring an investment advisor or investing in mutual funds.
3,About As Credible As The Subject Matter Itself,"As a hard core conservative who was justifiably horrified by the antics of the previous administration, I should appreciate this book. Although there is much truth written in the book, it is written in such a manner that it presents all the credibility of checkout line tabloid. I kept expecting to see references to the alien from outter space who has advised the last several administrations and how Clinton and Gore consulted former President John Kennedy who survived Dallas and is now living on a Greek Island."
3,"It's OK, but...","This text while having some good design examples, is not through as you may expect.""Steel Structures: Design and Behavior"" by Salmon and Johnson remains a better reference; what can a say, it's a classic. Other useful references would be the ""Manual of Steel Construction: Volume II Connections"" and for those designers that still remain in love with ASD ""Engineering for Steel Construction: A Source Book on Connections"" would be a reference to acquire.Tim YoungCumberland, VA"
4,Excellent,"I am 71 years old and this is the type of music I have always enjoyed. My sons (all in their late 40's) refer to the music I enjoy as ""elevator music"". Maybe so, but I will continue to enjoy this CD for quite some time."
5,Billboard 70's #1's,This cd is great and I enjoy all the songs on the play list. I've listened to it many times and it brings back to the 70's.
2,"Very basic, poorly done book and CD combo","The CD that goes with the Spanish text is very poor.The narrator sounds very unprofessional, in articulate, boring.The CD also stopped abruptly after about 10 lessons, seems to be broken. The book is OK for such a low price."
4,It gets the job done.,"It is pretty cheesy (sorry to the kids in it) but it is this ""cheesyness"" that kept my four young boys watching. We watched this video two times and had good conversation. We had a massive improvement in manners instantly.Beats the pants off telling the kids each time they make a mistake. This lesson was simply more effective. Did I mention its cheesy?"
2,It's no Orama,"If you were introduced to On Thorns I Lay with the album Orama as i was, Crystal Tears would be a dissapointment. Orama was a much harder metalic sound and with more death vocals. Not that i care for death vocals, but the guitar rhythms were done so well, i could overlook the death vox. Crystal Tears is much softer than orama, 80% of the guitar work is gone. There are a few good tracks, but if you liked Orama, skip this one."
1,Waste of time...don't bother!,"I was so excited when I saw this tablet and it was reasonably priced. But when I received it I had major problems trying to install it. This isn't even worth the 1 star minimum that I was required to give it! If your a Mac person this will be the biggest waste of time for you. The installation software says that it is for both Mac and PC. It absolutely isn't! So I went to the Adesso website to see if there is a different driver that I could download. There was...it didn't work. The only thing I could get this tablet to do was open files that the cursor was on before I plugged it in! It wouldn't move the cursor at all. Seriously, don't waste your money on this piece of junk...invest the money and just buy a Wacom. At least they are dependable and worth the investment."
1,this is a no no,"What ever you do dont buy this thing. It worked really well for the first few months, then it started to screw up. After that it messed up all of my programs on my computer and whenever my dad tried to fix it the tablet said, ""KERNEL ERROR"" most of you know what a kernel is,and for those who dont it means like(computer terms) the internal program.WHAT EVER YOU DO DONT BUY THIS THING.It messed up my whole computer(it was new too!), and it could mess up yours too."
2,So small for so much!,"I ordered this for our Thanksgiving road trip and was so surprised when I received it. It was such a small pack! It seems such a waste to ship, much less buy it. I am definitely disappointed with the quantity for the price. This should have been about $2 considering the 42 count pack is like $7. Anyway, know now not to buy the ""travel pack."" The wipes themselves work fine however."
3,CONFUSION,"I enjoyed the first three or four Chapel Inn books then started to get a little uptight and bored with the uncohesiveness in this ""series"". Like some of the comments in other reviews, I too feel that there are too many authors involved in writing and evolving this ""series"". These books should not be listed as a series and I would also like to know why there are so many authors all writing about the same cast of characters. While each book in itself is fairly pleasant, light reading, it gets a little confusing when a new author writes about the Chapel Inn folks with a slightly different writing style and perspective, it makes you have to work at getting reacquainted with the characters. I have decided not to continue with this series."
4,Good in many ways,"Overall, we are happy with this light. It gives off a fair amount of light, and each head can be directed onto a specific work area sending the light right to where it is needed. It is a sensible alternative to can lighting, especially in a smaller room. Moreover, it has an attractive, contemporary look that makes it more like a piece of art adding to its overall value. The light works best when mounted fairly high up, since it gives off heat and can therefore be somewhat uncomfortable to stand directly underneath for a taller person. As an average sized woman, this isn't a concern for me, but some tall guests have commented on this aspect of the light. Additionally, if the light is mounted on a lower ceiling, the light source comes from behind rather than from straight down, creating shadows. I have the light mounted in my kitchen, and reading a cookbook can sometimes be a problem as a result. Everything considered, it is a good choice -- I'd recommend it."
1,Warning - You must cut these designs yourself,"NOTE: These are not pre-cut, punch out stencils (as the smaller dover books are). You must cut these out yourself with an stencil/exato knife and the designs are very intricate. This book is not meant for children to use."
1,"Cheap parts, poor design","Luckily for me this kit came with 3 sets of hinges, instead of the two that it was supposed to have, since the hardware was so cheap that the screws kept snapping. This should have been an easy install, but it ended up taking over two hours - and the end result is far from satisfactory. The hinges stick - taking some muscle to get open (and closed again when they are opened). I wish I had spent a few more dollars for a better kit - and I may still do that. I do not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Messy Revision of a Golden Age Hero,"The Ray is one of the classic Golden Age heroes. But this attempt to revive the character did not work. There are some interesting ideas on family and the relationships between fathers and sons. But the plot is weak and the art is average. The main character is forgettable and the love story is forced. The supporting cast is truly awful with a bland love interest, idiotic villains, a string of out of place mentors-including crazy nuns and an ancient Asian man full of wisdom, and a 1950s style hoodlum hanging out in Philadelphia in the early 90s. Honestly the best part of the book is a solid introduction that gives historical insight into the character. When that's the best part of a comic book, you know you're in trouble. With the exception of die hard fans of the character, I would advise skipping ""The Ray: In A Blaze of Power."""
4,"Top Gear Episode excellent, Amazon Video on Demand... 3 out of 5","While the Top Gear episode was excellent, 720p video was good quality, there are problems with the Amazon VoD service. First off you can't save the videos to a network drive, it has to be a local drive. Why? It already has DRM (which I don't want) so it is completely unnecessary to restrict to local drives. Due to this I won't be buying anymore videos, and I can't stream because my internet connection speed is too slow. As for the video player, which is fairly well-featured, it has no image quality improvement when upscaling 720p to a 1080p display, you see the pixels which is quite annoying.Other than these issues, being able to purchase TV shows online is a very nice option, but due to these limitations I won't be continuing until some of these things improve."
5,Sea-worthy,"This story was excellent! I loved the main character's love of sea glass, as I am also a collector of shells and pretty glass I find on the beach. Her husband was a weak character, but interesting. The underlying theme of the times showed the difficulty of living then. I wished that the character who was secretly in love with the main character could have made his feelings known sooner and that they could have somehow ended up together instead of him being killed. I was glad that she was able to move on at the end of the book."
5,Shortcut through Therapy,It's an easy to read book as are all of Richard Carlson books. He will be missed by his readers.
3,Back to Turn-Coupe.,"Clay Benedict was only checking on his cousin's friend. He didn't expect to be drugged, tied up and drawn into Janna Kerr's problems. But one look at Janna's eight-year-old daughter told Clay he had to stay and help the ailing girl and her attractive mother. Romance, mystery and education about renal failure. What more could you want?"
3,Misled,I was disappointed that only a brief edited version of this debate was on the dvd. Don't buy it if you want to watch the debate. There's only about 10 minutes of it on there.
3,Hate to cook,"I got some ideas from this book, but a lot of the recipes required exotic items that take time to find and add to cost."
4,Soft but expensive,I gave a few of these to my daughter. She loves them because they are so thick and soft. I personally think they cost too much for what they are.
1,Socialist/Marxist/Leftist Diatribe,"The authors use clever techniques of Sophistry, by admitting that the book is indeed biased, thereby making the reader less resistant to their viewpoint, and making it more palatable in the mind of the person reading it. They also fill the book with HALF truths, so you will be lead to believe that it is ALL true. However, for those who are aware of these writers' tricks, it doesn't make the book less biased, or not one-sided, or not typically poorly researched, or even less sanctimonious as most of Mike Davis' books tend to be."
5,Making Cooking Fun,"Even though I have been cooking Jewish foods for almost 10 years (and have no children), the recipies offered in this book make preparing for the holidays fun! The challah recipie is a big hit now with my family and I make one every year for each evening meal. Highly recommend for the ""childish cook"" in all of us."
1,.Hack,"As with all Anime great animation and art work. Slow boaring story, no depth to characters a waste of my time."
1,"Looks great, works great...if you dont need a bright light!","PROS: Looks very cool, different mounting options, quite bendy yet sturdy, white lightCONS: VERY DIM: see customer photos for a side by side comparison of this lamp less than a foot from an object in ambient room lighting. And yes, the lamp was warmed up running for hours in a 60F room. I don't know how they come up with a 150W equivalent rating but this is replacing a 60w bulb and it isn't nearly as bright.Sad thing is I read a review with the same complaint but I thought the guy was just critical and expected too much. Well, now you have a photo to decide for yourself.BONUS: included an extra bulb - cool!I should send this back but I was so excited about the product quality I threw the boxes away.I bought this version (same same?) if it makes any difference:ShopLight Deluxe Lamp"
1,Baddd Single Player,"This game looked promising for a RTS, strategy but it is not, save your money especially if you want to play this as a single player. For us single player's, there is only the campaign, no skirmishes. I was getting killed repeatedly after the third mission in the campaign. There was little strategy, mostly luck. The semi-3D concept didn't work, especially when you finished a mission and the game started the story line and repositioned your view. The game has a 3D look but is really 2D in concept where all ships and such on the same plane even though it is in space and you can rotate the camera in any direction. This game didn't work with the auto repositioning and the actual 2D plane. I wish someone had reviewed this before me so I wouldn't have wasted $40.00. The game concept was OK and the tutorial was satisfactory, but it was hard to overcome the environment."
5,Valuable Information on many Jewish Views in a Concise Text,"Many topics are discussed here--adoption, fertility aids, life support, even bio-engineered foods. Chapters are written with intros and summaries, which helps the book serve as a quick reference on complex topics. Or, read all the in between for different viewpoints, and background thoughts that led to the decision. I read it cover to cover, even though most topics aren't relevant to my life right now, just to know the Jewish (conservative) view. It's interesting to read the Jewish response to twenty-first century concerns."
4,See how good this book is!,"I always enjoyed the Sweet Valley Twins books and I used to read them all the time. The characters are all so interesting and the stories enjoyable. This book in particular is fun to read. Jessica, as usual, is being her silly self and doesn't want to wear glasses. I find this part just a little unrealistic that having to wear glasses should be such a problem. Billions of people wear glasses, so why should Jessica act like she's the only person in the world who wears them? I think she was just a little overdramatic, but that's how her character is. Eventually, she sees that it doesn't matter if she has glasses or not, because no one seems to care. It's an enjoyable book, so go out and read it!"
2,Backpack,The backpack was large enough for my high school son's many books and lunch box. The only problem is the zipper broke a few days after beginning to use it.
2,Not Very Workable,"I had used Nolo for many things in the past, like Will Maker, and was very happy. Living Trust Maker was not that helpful. It does not allow for any personalization of one's intentions. For example, if you want to give $X to a charity or a friend and the balance to 1 or 2 beneficiaries, you cannot do that. It needs simple % per beneficiary. It also wants you to list each asset and does not give any general wording for any future asset, like a new bank account, you might have in the future. If you want to leave specific assets to exact people, then this might work, but if you have a pot and want to divide it up among beneficiaries, this probably will not work."
1,Steer Clear of this one.,"My wife bought me this flask for Christmas. It looked great, but when I took it out of the package and unscrewed the top, the tiny pin which connects the latch to the top fell out and I almost lost the pin in the couch. Total garbage. So, it showed up already broken. Shame on you, Coleman from China - how's that outsourcing working for you? Back it goes."
2,Don't get it wet...,"The first day I got this, I washed it by hand. After washing the flask about 80% of the ""leather"" swelled and now it looks like crap."
5,Bruce is the finest source for movie posters anywhere,"Bruce Hershenson offers yet another stunning example of movie poster art. As in all of his books, Bruce shows impeccable taste in selecting the finest sampling of Sports movie history dating back to the beginning of film spanning to current day. The only complaint with the book is that it is only 80 pages long when movie poster collectors and lovers like myself keep wishing for 800."
5,Great for dry skin wounds,"Great product for skin wounds that don't drain large amounts of fluid. If they do, cut a small slit to let the drainage out, then cover the cut with a bandaid. Otherwise, these dressings are great."
4,nice,Very nice watch would recommend it too anyone who needs a watch to wear for work and also when going out for dinner. The only thing that stopped me from rating it a 5 star was that the anologue screen is too small.. The watch looks big but is not too heavy and it will definately get noticed.
5,I'm sure it will perform flawlessly.....,"I haven't used the hyperlubricant as of yet. I have an oil change coming up soon, so will try it then. Also, will put some in the rear end of my truck, hope it works there too. Thank you Amazon and radio station WLW, American Truckers Network, Cincinnati Ohio. Floyd, NC"
5,Dura Lube: The Best Additive for your Engine,"I have been uding Dura Lube Engine Treatment for 12 years in all my personal and work vehicles. I must say that I honestly think it helps against engine wear. I have one truck with over 200,000 miles, another work truck with over 300,000 miles and a couple more over 150,000 and I have had ZERO engine/oil related problems. You can tell the first time you add this to your fresh oil change as your engine operates more smoothly. It also helps cold starts.I have to give Dura Lube 5 stars based on personal experience."
5,I've Used Dura Lube Since 1990,I have been using this product since 1990. I have even used it in an aircraft that I have owned. The first time that I changed oil and filter on the plane I noticed in flight that the oil temp was 30 to 40 degrees lower than before and the cylinder head temp was about 20 to 30 degrees lower. Doing a compression check at 1400 hours each cylinder was at least 75/80. This stuff works as advertised.
4,"Good, but not faithful to his recordings","I grew up listening to my parents' copy of Lehrer's first 10-inch LP. By the time I was old enough to buy my own records, I knew these songs by heart. But I couldn't play piano.When this book came out, I figured it'd be a good time to take a stab at the instrument. I bought the book immediately and started learning to play the tunes. Though I wasn't a piano player, I could read music and carefully picked out the notes, measure by measure.I was happy to be able end up playing these tunes, but was disappointed that the arrangements were not the same as on any of the records. The voicings are all different from what he played, and somewhat watered down. I wish whoever did the transcriptions could have taken the extra time to make them more accurate."
3,Order only if you are going to have a burrito-thon....,"Six packs of wraps with about 8-10 wraps per pack...better have some BIG wrap appetites if you order these...even frozen, they get stale FAST."
1,How not to learn about theatre,"Writing from a by-spirits-possessed perspective, David Cole attempts to trace the development of Theatre from its origins in early humans to the present. It insists upon mystical terminology to describe the workings of theatre and uses them as something more than mere metaphor. It is a nice discussion for what it is, but it seems to think that this metaphor is the correct one."
4,Great look inside of a US Embassy,"It's well worth the purchase price. It's made up of a bunch of different stories written by people who been there and done that. If your interested in finding out what it's like inside a US Embassy, then I recomend it fully."
3,"Poor version of ""our lips are sealed""","I think ""our lips are sealed"" is one of the best songs Terry Hall has written and one of the best pop songs of the eighties. Anyone buying this CD should be warned that the URDU version of the song included here bears no resemblance to the original single version. It is a very poor substitute for the original track. I would suggest buying the original Fun Boy Three CDs from which this compilation is taken, all of which are available at budget prices anyway."
3,"Interesting, but lacking depth","This book promises a wealth of information for the process engineer interested in Petrochemical Processes. While it does contain a certain amount of useful information, useful for example as introductions to undergraduate Chemical Engineering courses on various of the topics covered, the information presented is not particulary in-depth. Some of the latter chapters on polymerization processes read a bit like the technical information you can find on company web sites rather that as chapters... OK, but not great."
4,Excellent Book,"I like this book. It's content is excellent. I wish it had color photos though. Lots of good information in it. I've only been weaving for a year so it will take me a while to get to working from this book, but I'm looking forward to it."
5,Life Saver,"Neiko 440 Lb. Electric Hoist - With Remote ControlThe hoist itself was a life saver for job intended. The only problem was the service from the company it was ordered from. It took a month atleast to finally recieve the product.I don't know who's fault it was,but it caused more manual labor than expected because of poor shipping procedures.Otherwise,the hoist works great,the only thing I would change is the length of the control cable.it needs to be about two or three feet longer."
5,A Definite Refresher...,"Well, I picked up this CD at their live show and this is amazing... It's so great to hear bands doing different things, especially in a world of redundant musical garbage.Their CD is just as amazing and energetic as their live shows. I was thoroughly impressed by the upright bass players speed and talent, the drummer laid down a solid backbeat and the guitars were amazing, throw in singer who can croon and scream and you have one of the best underground bands around.If you're into horror movies, punk, psychobilly, rockabilly or just straight up rock 'n' roll, this album is a must have."
4,Her underlying message is what to focus on!,"The Politics of Stupid is an interesting book to say the least. Sure Susan rants about men and is angry at them (if you, as a woman, were done wrong by men time after time you'd probably feel the same way.) Most people make generalizations based on their personal experiences anyway. Her style of writing does take some getting used to, and I have to agree that chapter separations would have made the book easier to manage. (Hence only 4 stars.) If you can tune out her anger towards men and some radical feminist views, you'll see that her ranting is meant to empower and shock you into listening to a great message.Susan's message is about accountability for your own actions, learing to stop believing the big corporation, multi-million dollar advertising lies, live and think for yourself, and make a difference in the world around you.Honestly, how can a message like that be wrong?"
2,Deflated expectations,"The title was promising, but the book says precious little about politics. Pity, it could be interesting. The recommendation is as sound as it is obvious: eat better, exercise more and you will lose weight, but beyond this there is nothing in this book that would be worth reading. Worse, the writing is incoherent and ranting. It may pass for a 'motivational speech' but put in print it is really annoying. Ms. Powter takes liberties with facts, or rather is ignorant of them, for instance, by claming that one cannot gain fat weight by eating anything but fat. Untrue. Sugar converts to fat very nicely. It is fat that cannot be converted to sugar. (There is more.) She, in her mind, has discovered the final and the only correct understanding of the problem of obesity, and anyone who disagrees with her is wrong. She hasn't. I was disappointed and would recommend many better written and more factually sound books."
1,Horrible,I couldn't make it through the first 2 chapters. Didn't even bother to pass it on. Horrible....
2,Manic Moron,"This woman is a manic idiot. Yes her points are right on but when she finally gets around to them it's 2 years later. Google her name and you come up with at least 5 websites that have been started only to be abandoned a few months later. Now she is on Spreaker radio and wonder of wonders, she has been consistent with that. Her meds must of kicked in. She is angry and needs to cool off. She hates men, is ultra feminist and boring. Move, eat well and breath. DUH so revolutionary. Listen to her radio show and your eyes cross within two seconds. She starts to make a wonderful point only to go off on a tangent and never completes one thought. Susan go away. I am also sick of her vulgar mouth."
4,Insightful!,"This book is for the individual that is interested in living a life of wellness. It discusses some of the, not so wonderful, things going on in the American culture that affect your health directly, every day. If you want to feel better, lose weight, accomplish more... read this book, it'll get you thinking."
1,The Politics of Stupid,"What a shame! Susan's man hating tirade is tiresome and boring. Plus the advice she is giving is just the same old, same old. She brags about how good she looked in bed with a 24 year old, her latest lover. Disgusting! What ever happened to being happily married instead? She is so nasty no wonder she can't stay married. Stop the Insanity was so much better. Now she is just plain mean, angry,nasty, and seriously needs an attitude adjustment. She won't be able to continue on like this much longer. She'll end up old, nasty and alone. What a shame. So much potential."
1,Worst book ever written!,"I lost a whole lot of fat following Susan Powter.To me she was an icon - a sane, down-to-earth person who knew how to slim down sensibly.Now she seems all BUT sane and down-to-earth.Just look at the cover. She looks awful with her weave and breast implants. I was under the impression that cosmetic surgery was a bad thing to Susan Powter. That the natural body was the most fantastic thing in the world...Well, she changed her mind...If you read this, Susan.... Get over your divorce and bad relationships! It's a bore to hear about ten years later...To the rest of you: Save your money! The book is awful."
1,Politics of Stupid,"Susan is radical, cut to the chase and honest. The book is harsh reality. Do not get this book for someone who is an emotional ""softy"". You can tell she is pissed off by the ""paid programming"" on TV because of the way she wrote this book. The Tele edits all that is the gut reality. The ""diet pill companies"" make a lot of money and you can bet they do not want you to know the real truth. She says throughout...just get up and MOVE YOUR BODY. This is her basic issue and to put good food into your body.I like Susan because she sets a great physical example, but I found this book harsh and insulting."
2,Wish I'd known how lightweight the fabric is.,"I LOVE a wide-brim hat. The wider the better. However...This hat is SO lightweight that it's almost sheer in bright sunlight.The style is great, but I don't think that I'd get much UV protection while wearing it.I wish the description had mentioned how thin the fabric is.But I suppose if you're buying it solely as an accessory, you'll be pleased."
1,Buy something else,"I worked out how to set it up the first time, only minor spillage, but no big deal in my opinion. My problem with it (and the reason I give it only 1 star) is that the can only worked fine for about a year and a half. But after that year, the rubber gasket that seals the valve to the can (sits inside the black threaded part) got eaten away by the gas vapors or exposure to gas during refueling, and now it leaks like crazy, pouring gas everywhere. Unless you want to replace the gasket every year or so, I suggest using a different means to store and dispense gas.The valve is hardly an environment helper if you have to toss the plastic can away into a landfill every year."
1,The color list is wrong,The colors listed in the description are wrong. There is no white or green. There is a silver and yellow instead.Dura Lube HL-48901-06 Pro Fix 6 Body Shop Repair Kit
1,No white,This isnt a very good product..they said to mix all the colors to get white...how in the world...White is the lack of color...all colors together is black...I dont suggest buying this product
5,easy plateau,"the cd is great, but how it got to me... not so much. it took forever. lots of issues with the ordering process."
1,What's the big deal!,"Mike, What is the big deal about Lordship? I read your book and attend your former church (C.O.D.). We are all believers, let's not get caught up in this minor issue. You said in one of our bible studies together that it will all work out in the end anyway. Stop making a big deal about it. Mac Arther is a good man and is not leading people astray. God bless."
3,Great customer service---not so great pants.,"These pants were listed as a large, but they were not. I'm typically a 10-12 in pants and these were too tight. They seem to be intended to sit much lower than the photograph implies. I was pretty bummed because the picture looks so fabulous and I love a great pair of gauchos. The material was a little thinner than I expected, too. Nevertheless, the customer service both in terms of delivery and return of the item were top-notch! I would shop with this company again if I found something that looked like it would be a good match and has more reviews to read."
2,Not a Whole Movie,I bought this sequel because I liked the first movie. This picture contained all the elements that I liked about the first except and ending. What I thought was another movie is only half a movie. You need to purchase Arthur 3 to get the end of this story. There is a set with both movies 2 and 3. I recommend that instead.
2,"OK stove, overpriced and has a few issues.","This stove is well built, easy to set up and cooks fine on high settings. BUT: The self-ignite function work only about half the time before you'll give up and light it yourself. And the heat adjustment knobs are very difficult to use and touchy unless you set it to high. It is very difficult to set to low or even medium, it's either high or off. When you finally get the setting you want, it occasionally drifts to a lower setting or even drifts to off. I recommend spending the money on a stove by another brand, either a cheaper one that will satisfy just as well as this one or a more expensive one that is much better made."
2,COLORED WATER,"This is a RIPOFF...its soooo watery...this stuff wont stick to anything,the purpose of paintball paint is to MARK your opponent. This Will NOT get the job done. but i will be mixing it with some crappy paint my friend gave me..."
4,Good product for a small business,"I bought this product for personal finances and it is laid out for a business. If it said that, I missed it. Anyway in this one it does tell you the name of the one for personal financies but Amazon is all out of that one right now. So I will be sending this one back probably."
4,An Unabashed Look at the Sexual Abuse Scandal,"This short volume is designed to be used by groups to come together to face the abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, explore their anger, and reflect on their pain. Bausch presents an uncompromising look at the scandal in a balanced, yet stark portrayal. Written before the Dallas meeting of the bishops, this is a marvelous toold for small group reflection on the situation."
4,Case for iPhone 3GS,"Fits a little tight, but fills the bill. The finish on this model is not as good as on the previous one that I purchased. Same manufacturer."
1,DLO Leather Holser Case for iPhone,My iPhone did not fit in this case... too tight... can not get phone out easily
1,excellent design poor durability,I received this holster as a gift for christmas '07 and by May '08 the belt clip had nearly torn through the leather. I had noticed a loose bit of material but did not pay much attention for a couple of weeks. When I took a closer look I was shocked to see that there was only an inch or so of material still holding the belt clip to the leather. If the belt clip had torn completely off I would have lost the phone.I loved this case as I did not notice I was carrying it and accessibility to the phone was great. Too bad I can't recommend it because of it's durability.
1,Belt Clip,The belt clip torn early on then it broke way from the case. I am very disappointed I like the case a lot.
3,For naked* iPhones Only,"I tried to use this product, but I like to use skins to protect my iPhone, since i am a bit clumsy and drop expensive objects a lot. With the ToughSkin on my iPhone I cannot place it inside of the case, since it is form fitted to a naked iPhone. Also it uses a clip to hold it to your body, I would rather have it attach to my belt loop, so it would not fall off, since I am a bit crazy about keeping my objects safe from breaking."
3,As Advertised,I found this product to work as advertised. Holds the Iphone securely and is fairly easy to retrieve the phone when needed.
2,Not like the original,I was happy to find what I thought was the same product that I had. I ordered 2 but when they came I realized the clip was only glued with few stitches to holder. The old 1 I had the back of clip was sewn under material and very strong. I don't expect these to last nearly as long
1,did not like it,product that i recieved was total different from the one i saw online. iphone 3 GS hardly fits into this holster case. online it said it was for iphone 3GS. i should have returned the product but i am so busy with work..no time for these things. i am not gonna buy from this sender for sure or may be avoid this kind of online shopping.
2,Terrible Clip,"The belt clip on this product is too stiff. If you try to force it you can easily rip the clip from the case. I use this case with an iphone 4 that has a pixel skin bumper. The phone fits, but somewhat snugly. Unfortunate, because this is an otherwise excellent case. But if you are looking for something that is going to see heavy use it might be worth it to spend a few more dollars because you will be fighting with this case every time you put it on your belt."
4,Good Holder,I like having a rubber cover over my iPhone to protect it when it gets dropped sometimes. This case is a little snug for the first few weeks until you can stretch it to accommodate the phone and cover. The case always stays clipped to my pants and doesn't fall off. I like how it is horizontal instead of vertical. Easier to remove the phone from the case.
1,FELL APART IN TWO MONTHS & MANUFACTURER REFUSED WARRANTY,"After only two months the clip separated from the case rendering it worthless. After contacting DLO (a Philips company) regarding a warranty replacement I received the following email: ""I apologize for the problem you are having with your case. Unfortunately, soft items such as cases do not carry a warranty through DLO, only our electronic products carry a warranty through us. Any warranty on your case would be through the retailer. Because of this, we will be unable to replace your case, I am sorry. "" The DLO site however specifically outlines a one year limited warranty [...]I would avoid not only this DLO case, but any DLO product because of their poor customer service and warranty policy."
3,DLO Leather holster for iPhone 3Gs.,The holster is a quality made product and the look and feel are first rate. The problem is that the fit is so snug I can barely get the iPhone to slide in and out of the holster. I have been using the holster for almost a month and it is just now starting to stretch enough that I am not having to fight as hard to get the phone out of the holster. This has been a problem when a call comes in and I try to answer before the call is routed to voice mail.
4,Great Case!,Stylish and very functional. Not intended for heavy use on a daily basis. I went through two in six months as the seams tore. Would recommend this for moderate daily use.
4,nice holster,holster is a very good fit for my Iphone 3gs and had avery nice price. It is similar to the first one I bought at AT&T just a lot cheaper.
5,Good overview,"I have watched this show on History International, so when I saw it in dvd format I knew I wanted it. Don't look for an in-depth study of the Celts on this dvd. At only fifty minutes long that would not be possible. However, this dvd gives a good overview of ancient Celtic culture. The computer animations are entertaining and the information is presented well. This is the best dvd on ancient Celtic culture I have found to date."
2,Very Disappointing!!,"I remember Kreator was a thrashin' metal band. So, I decide to try out one of their newer releases. ENDORAMA is so disappointing. The songs are very mediocre and are very BORING. WEAK. The choruses are weak. NOT WORTH BUYING."
3,decent but not excellent,"I thought the recipes were too simple and ignored major ingridients that are used in sephardic cooking. The only advantage is very few ingridents, so it is easy to shop. Disadvantage: the taste suffers and isn't aromatic enough."
1,"If you are new to VB and or have VB5, don't get this book.","I was fairly new to Visual Basic when I ordered this book. It is a good book for beginners. Unfortunately the book was written when VB3 was in its heyday. To cut to the chase, the programs won't compile on VB5."
2,Very DIM light,"The lamp looks very cool and modern and the spectrum of the light is very pleasing, but it is so dim that it is not useful for me. The low setting also flickers noticeably, but since the bright setting is already too dim, why use the low setting? One other thing that I wish they had done better: the switch is difficult to work from below.I like the little tray - it has a little indentation which is perfect for reading glasses (which I need because the light is too dim.)Did I mention that the light is too DIM? :)"
2,"Rating the product itself here, not the sender or the music...","I received this CD and it only had the ""Group Sex"" album even though the CD and cover said it was supposed to have both albums listed above. I contacted the record label and they explained that there had been a run of these CDs printed after they had lost the license to distribute ""Wild In The Streets"", so before they were able to change the artwork to reflect the single album being pressed, several copies of the double-album artwork/track-listing version had slipped out. The seller did not know about this and when I forwarded them the e-mail sent from Frontier Records, I was given a refund. No loss, no foul, just ask the seller to verify there are more than 20 tracks ON THE CD ITSELF before buying it."
1,Disappointment BIG Time,The book was a big disappointment.I wanted to use it in my study of Revelation that I am teaching. It only had comments for the first 5 chapters and then the last two chapters. Chapters 6 through 18 are the difficult chapters and they are completely ignored in this book. So it is useless for me. I would like to send it back.
2,Life Lessons- Could be explained better,I bought this as a study guide for one person. As a novice I think it would be better for a group study or for an individual who has a background in the chapters of the bible.
4,Revelation (Life Lessons) by Max Lucaeo,"The book came in good condition and a timely delivery. I would have preferred to know more about the condition of the book before I ordered such as whether it looked worn, had markings on the pages, etc. That would have helped me decide whether to order."
1,a hacker no more?,i have played and read about golf all my life. sometimes promises made are not kept ... my condolences to the author's wife.
3,Hmmm....,"I must admit that when I bought this book I thought I was going to get some interesting glimpse of life aboard Titanic and of its sinking through Canadian passengers, but I was disappointed. This is more like a book of the family history of each Canadian passenger. It rarely delves into interesting Titanic facts and instead reminds us of information that has already been written. I must say though, there are some little gems of information present but they are too few and aren't realy delt with. A good reads though."
4,Specific for those Canadians with friends/relatives who may have been on Titanic,"My husband was very sick and did not recover suffiently to read this, but it looks interesting. I will read it some day."
1,uhhhhh,"boy this sucker doesnt know when to die. I'm just questioning myself how the **ck does he do it, but this one along with Ice-T's bad performance and the story goes dead in the night and never comes back, it gets lost a lot of times."
1,Complete Crap!!!!!!,"... what have they done to this series! The Leprechaun series remained excellent until part 4, which wasnt as bad as some say, I actually thought that was quite good. But this is utter ...! wasnt even good for a few cheap low budget film thrills!! I give it one star for the makeup on the Lep, the girls, the few jokes, and the ok gore scenes. If youre looking for a good continuation of the series, skip this one! Its not even suitable for a follow-up to 4!! To horrible to describe it any further! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!..."
4,Lucky Charms,"This new entry in the series is another winner. Warwick Davis has the character down pat and his Leprechaun rap is not to be missed. Unfortunately, the dvd doesn't have many extras only a few trailers. Look forward to the next installment."
2,Not too good.,I love Leprechaun but this movie is boring. This is the worst one yet. Ice t is barley in it and he doesnt do much any way
1,Wilted Clover,"I must admit, I saw the first Leprechaun movie years ago and thought that it was an original, freaky deaky concept that had me running from real leprechauns like a frightened gazelle. But after two, and then four trips to the end of the rainbow, the pot of gold seemed to lose its luster and weight. Warwick Davis is a very talented actor, who carried movies like this one and Willow (with Ice Man from Top Gun)on his back like the Globe of Atlas. He worked with what he had and bathed in a warm pool of success for a brief period. But Leprechaun movies beyond the initial one were just so overkill that he eventually was in outerspace and now he's kicking it with washed up gangster rappers. I'm sorry it just doesn't fly. New Jack City was Ice-T's last decent outing and that was in the late 80's. He should hang up the holster and Davis should at least attempt to find greener pastures."
1,Bad product,"I purchased this item for my husband as a gift. I was excited when it arrived and so was he. He followed the directions and realized the razor was NOT holding a charge, so he tried it again and had the same problem. We contacted the seller and had a problem with them. Amazon.com came through and took care of the situation. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!"
2,For devotees of Internet market-hype ...,"The Hagel et al. argument hasn't improved. I've offered more than 1 star *only* because some people actually want to read unbridled enthusiasm, and want to believe, irrespective of the argument's merits.The first book had the saving grace that the authors had at least *noticed* that the first few attempts at consumer Internet commerce had been duds, and had even identified one of the key reasons why.But Hagel and his new co-author persist with the contention that e-consumers can be attacked with the same gusto, and the same broadcast-originated, born-to-consume philosophy that has been costing investors a great deal of money, and that will not achieve the breakthrough."
2,Very disappointed--blows very hard and loud,"I had such high hopes for this hair dryer -- well-known brand, diffuser with long ""fingers"" just like I prefer, etc. Well the first time I used it my hair looked like I had been through a wind tunnel! The low setting is like most other hair dryers' high settings, even with the diffuser on. It really blasts the air out! I have wavy/lightly curly hair and it made my hair a frizzy mess. This dryer may be fine for people with straight hair, but I definitely do not recommend it for people with wavy or curly hair."
5,Excellent Book,Awesome book....I have many books in this series and every nursing student should have them. They make things much easier to understand!!
1,Skip this Book,This is one of the worst technical books I have ever read. The first 6 chapters are redundant info that anyone working with ADO should have mastered. The examples are all 'By-The-Book' cases that have marginal relevance to real systems. The cover photo betrays the 'its not very serious' attitude conveyed by the authors. And like most WROX books much verbiage is spent marketing the technology. It is cheaper & easier to simply use the MSDN knowledgebase rather than waste money on this text.
3,"Great at first, tore through pants later","At first I loved it. But over time, the metal inside the money clip holder wore through the leather and then tore through my jeans. I am now buying a different kind of card/money holder."
3,Remote doesn't control volume,"My only complaint about this product is that when using the speakers that come with the DVD player, you cannot adjust the volume remotely. You must go to the speaker and turn it up or down. This is obviously a bit of an inconvenience. Otherwise, seems to work well and the speakers have pretty decent sound."
4,Hi-tech suspense silliness,"I didn't believe the premise of ""The Grid"" for one minute, and yet I found it immensely enjoyable. It reads like a Stephen King horror novel and treads some of the same ground. The horror is a malevolent computer that takes over a newly constructed building and proceeds to kill the humans trapped inside in an increasingly grisly manner. Author Kerr makes all this quite exciting as long as you don't take it too seriously."
4,A gripping thriller in the style of Crichton.,Built round a 'big idea' with a disparate team of core players facing off against the computer.The result is custom made for Hollywood but this British author rings a few cross atlantic changes and stimulates the mind as well as the senses.I found the sci/tech AI premiss a little unconvincing but Kerr plays it well and is ingenious in finding new ways for the computer to wield it's power.As an English expatriate in the States I think this author deserves a bigger readership over here with his Anglo/American style. This one could do it for him but check out a 'Philosophical Investigation' for deeper content.
2,Disappointing,"It's hard to believe that this book was the product of the same author that presented us with the Berlin Noir trilogy.For me, an interesting concept was delivered in a pedestrian, though adequately researched, manner and in completing the book, I found myself unsatisfied. Whereas the each of the BN trilogy pieces featured a pace and level of intrigue which maintained interest, THE GRID was predictable throughout in story line and character development.Also was disturbed by a reliance on needlessly coarse language and (shabby) titillation in an effort to keep the story moving. Language and titllation is good stuff but not when used as a crutch.Will I read another Philip Kerr novel? Probably, but not until I more carefully read other people's reviews. And then maybe I'll borrow someone else's copy.Jon Hill"
1,Shoddy physcial quality - damaged goods,The physical quality of the disk I bought was not good. Scratched ......have no worries about the performers. Pity I have wasted my money not being able to watch the whole thing.
4,Southwest Virginia,"Very interesting book. Lots of facts and history for the newly arrived, as well as the born here local resident."
1,Junk,"I would give this thing -5 stars if possible. This product is flimsy and bows in or out when you put it in place in a stall shower. The shelves won't stay in place because the cheap plastic shims they give you don't work. There is some kind of powered coating on it that simply rubs off when you move a shelf on the pole. They give you 3 pieces of tape to put over the joints where two tubes come together. They say that's to prevent water leaking into the joints. I can just feel the rust forming now. I took the thing apart and put it back in the box. I'm not returning it because it will cost me nearly as much to do that as it cost to buy this lemon. I was thinking of giving it to Goodwill, but it would be an act of bad will to foist it off on someone else. I just ordered the OXO stainless steel shower caddy as a replacement."
1,Not worth it,"We returned it the same day we bought it from another seller. Product is not sturdy! The rubber rings that are supposed to hold the shelves in place are very difficult to insert completely, making the shelves uneven. Another issue is the spacing of the bars on the trays. They are high enough so that I don't feel bottles would fall out easily, but they are sort of open across the bottom of the front faces. Anything less than a full bar of soap will slide right through the gaps."
2,better information available elsewhere,"This book lacks a coherence and analysis that leaves the reader with the sense of an incoherent selection of arbitrary rules that are applied across all styles of buildings. The illustrations are of poor quality. The selection of illustrated abuses are often so appalling that it is often hard to see how correcting the cited rule violation would significantly improve the example.The authors have chosen to focus exclusively on appearance, and do not (often) address the structural or durability aspects of exterior design. It is the mix of practical structural/weather-tightness/utility and pleasing appearance that makes architecture such a satisfying study.The people that need to read this book most likely will not. After all they're still building McMansions aren't they?"
5,An excellent reference for sorting through the myriad of production housing mistakes!,"Having spent a number of years in the production building market, it is safe to say every professional I've worked with in the past, whether junior designer or Snr VP, lacked a sufficient understanding of traditional architecture to recognize the countless errors found throughout entire librabries of product.Steve's book would be an excellent choice for the production building industry's implementation of ""Required Reading and Reference Material 101"", if such a program were to exist.The implementation of correct details in conjunction with the elimination of improper details, windows, etc. could very well provide national builders with cost-effective product in keeping with traditional architecture. Imagine that!Excellent book... a fantastic choice for the everyday designer/architect searching for answers as to why most homes ""just don't look/feel like home""."
3,Dated and Negative but quite complete,"There is some overt ethnocentrism in Friedlander's Introduction that jeopordizes the quality of his analysis. He also spends more time despairing over the lack of quality in Cranach's latest work than he does really analyzing it in any depth or trying to explain the decline that he perceives. The catalogue is extremely thorough and helpful to anyone trying to get a sense of Cranach's works, this will be helpful to anyone planning on writing a monograph (and someone really should) on Cranach, less so to the Cranach enthusiast."
5,Rainshow'r replacement filters,I have had a Rainshow'r water filter for some time now. I like them and will continue using them as long as I can purchase the replacement filters for them. I like that they are easy to change and don't cost all that much for what they do. Really would like if they had other types as I would like them for all over my house.
2,Not at all what I expected...,"Picture reproduction quality grainy / poor...text pretty good, but not as focused on the subject as I expected..."
1,Listening Hearts,"Outstanding book for those trying to figure out how they are called by God or to explain those folks who want to talk about how much God has talked to them. God does have His way of ""Calling"" - I'm clueless - and this book is helping in many ways to assist me in figuring out even the tiniest hint how I am feeling called."
3,Good beginners book,"Pretty good beginner level information in this book. I like the focus on OxyAcetylene, because I feel every new welder should know OAW before other processes. The book has a good amount of illustrations in it, which I think are important for beginners. A lot that you do in welding and cutting with gas relies a lot on sights and sounds as you're doing it. For instance, you need to be able to see & recognize what the metal looks like when it is time to start moving the torch to create your weld or when it is time to add oxygen to your flame to begin a cut. Unfortunately, I don't think they did a good enough job with the illustrations in this book. A black & white piece of line art is only marginally better than nothing at all, in my opinion. Replace these illustrations with photographs and I'd give this book 5 stars.Keep in mind, this is a beginner's book and really aimed mostly at hobbyists, not someone looking to make it a career (at least in the short term)"
5,Welding,"A very good book on torch welding, easy to understand and well written, I recommend it to anyone wanting the knowledge, well covered in this book."
2,Why isn't this movie available on Blu-Ray yet.?,Yes .Hi.Shame on Sony pictures.Fans of this film deserv so much more/but I guess they don't care.I call Sony pictures all the time.And all I get is there is'nt enough demand to put this film on disc.So. I bough the amazon instant video download.Decent/but not great qulity.As far as those old VHS tapes go.At $ 49.95 and $ 89.95.The sellers must be on some heavy drugs.And anyone who pays that much for some crappy VHS tape.Should have their head examined.!!!!!!!!!!!Because the amazon instant video is better then crappy VHS.Any day of the week.!!!And twice on a Sunday.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Hot Rods, Rat Rods","Some interesting old film footage, but not enough discussion of how these things were created. Did not quite live up to the advertised hype."
3,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,I choice this rating because I find myself reading it just to finish it. He took everything far afield - it certainly hasn't held my interest! I'll be glad to finish it - I'm at 77 percent done and really couldn't tell you anything about the book. Maybe I just wasn't ready for reading - or my mind was on other things while I was reading.
3,Not the most powerful or meaningful Rinalid book,"I'd be going too far to say this is the best book ever, or this is my favorite book ever. But putting that aside, this book is still worth your time and money. Aimed at pre adolescent females, this book has the average old cheap chessy romance girls reap for, and some excitment in a few blown chunks in numerous areas of this book. Not her most powerful or productive novel, but still good."
1,Same old tiresome harangue,"Edit this OUT of your reading list! The War of Northern Aggression was never over slavery. Had the issue actually been slavery, slave labor would not have continually been used to construct federal buildings in Washington, DC, well into the War! Slavery would have been immediately abolished in every state (it was not). Lincoln would ot have offered to ""let"" the Southerners keep their slaves in exchange for not seceding (which he did!) This book seems to have been written to be sensationalist, rather than to reflect historical significance. This kind of gratuitous writing is revolting. For a much better read, try Heroines of the South, which is an actual compilation of letters and diary entries by Southern ladies during the War."
5,"The characters in this book are so strong, they seem real!","This is one of my all time favorite books. I just read it for the 2nd time yesterday and it is still as fresh in my memory as if I had lived it. This book is long, but worth every minute of reading that you invest in it."
3,Addendum,"When I wrote the above review, I had just finished the first part of the book-the so-called ""West to East"" section.Janet's description of the second part-the route through Wales-reads much better and easier than the first; hence the upgrade to three stars.If you can pick this up at a very reduced price, and if you skip the first section, it might make a worthwhile read. At the original $32+ asking price, I should say it's well overpriced."
4,A good book to get an overall understanding on diesels,Most of the book is great on getting a good foundation on how diesels and thier periphrial system work. Good beginning diagnostic ideas also. Some of the book has diagrams that are only a little help unless you have that particluar diesel engine. Good for anyone wanting to know how these amazing engins work. Forget almost all you know about gasoline engins. Diesels are very different and this book is good to read to find out how different they are.
5,Awesome book,Screw those other guys talking about his wrong equation you will NEVER use. Awesome overall book on understanding and repairing Diesel engines. One of my favorite books that I have read on repair. Typo or not.
4,Pricey but worth it.,"Price was a little higher then I would prefer, but considering it's for a shaver that is almost 15 years old and no longer being made, I guess I really can't complain too much if the heads work just like the original. Quality are well worth it."
4,"Expensive, but necessary",Fits just fine. But it is a bit expensive for an old razor. I was relieved to find that this replacement head fit perfectly.
1,terrible,"Broke after two uses, buttons are hard to switch, and drying time was not better than my old-school model. in fact, my hair was frizzier. i was kinda glad it broke. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this."
1,when it works its worth 4 stars!,"This hair dryer did work well and I could absolutely tell a difference the ionizer made in my hair...it dried faster, more of a shine and fullness, and not as dry. However, after a week of use it completely died on me. So I returned it and got another one.....it also died on me after two weeks. I had a basic model hair dryer that lasted me 3 years....I'll be going back to it."
3,late and complicated,"I ordered the watch and paid for 2 day delivery. It arrived a week late. Then, the watch itself is nice, but is incredibly complex. I don't have the dozen or so hours it takes to read the 100 page manuel which accompanied the watch. Perhaps there are people with nothing better to do than read such books, but I just need a watch that works. This one is way too complicated and was not advertised as such. My recommendation is: find another watch."
2,SUV on your wrest,"Well,It looked like a cool all-in-one watch. The only information that was missed, was a thickness of this super-device. When it arrived I was really surprised: they are huge! It is whole 2cm (3/4"") thick. Also the body of the watch is design for smaller wrest than my (I am 5:10. I returned this item and exchanged for different model, with no G-Shock"
5,Fun Monkey,I have this exact item in red and it is extremely well made and cute. Mine has a long tail in the back. The way the monkey hangs from the key ring made me decide it needed to hang from my parking tag on my rear-view mirror -- perfect and fun! It may be a little large to put your every-day keys on but it's still a great item and would make a good gift for anyone who likes monkeys or was born in the year of the monkey.
5,Democrat sycophants are afraid of this book,"Clinton-lovng democratic sycophants are afraid of this book and it is obvious from their skewing of the review ratings that have been posted thus far. Five star ratings are getting a 90 to 95 percent ""helpful"" rating and one star ratings are getting a 20 percent or less ""helpful"" rating. The level of vitriol is amazing. Buy this book and read it and find out why the liberals are so afraid of it."
1,Waste of time and money,"After reading a few pages, I had to stop. The authors are very subjective and many of these so-called ""facts"" aren't even that. And of course they bitterly try to redirect the blame to a former President. Sure, they can fool the ignorant and narrow-minded, but not a well-informed person. Thank God the bookstore let me return it because it's garbage!!!"
3,Gyotaku: The Art and Technique of the Japanese Fish Print,"I have a copy of this book. It's a small book (65 pages). Good information on technique but the small number of pictures (only one in color) was a big disappointment. There aren't any other books about gyotaku I have found, but before you pay a lot of money for this I would just put ""gyotaku"" into a search engine on the internet. I found info that was just about as good that way for free."
5,When you need a friend.,"It was just an ordinary day for me, perhaps one more of so many hundred. Like a Lady you find, just dressed to the nine's, it took my breadth for a second. There it was""Miss Vera's finishing school for Boys who want to be Girls"" by Veronica Vera. ""Great Mother in Heaven"" I exclaimed under my breadth,""I must have this book!"" I wasn't let down, In the first few minutes I had the book in my hands, the picture's were telling me somebody really could like me out there. Her stories wer very suportive and very kind. Sometimes I feel that I may be asking to much of myself in dressing the way my imag-ination sees me. What I get most from the book is the idea that with the right attitude and confidence and the many ideas from the book, I can give it the Academy try. Miss Vera is insightfull, and simply wonder-full. A not to be missed, cover to cover hug."
1,Anchor does NOT set,"I would not recomment this product. The product does not work as described. The anchor should haveexpanded after tightening the screw, but instead, twisted not allowing the anchor to set. We tried several times but only two worked correctly. So, of the 20 in the pack two are in the wall, seven twisted, and the rest are being returned to the store."
2,Wings fall off,"My son loves this toy, but I think it is junky for the price. He wants to flap the wings and they pop off-you can not open them like in the picture at all."
3,Not a bad movie,"Radcliff did a good job, my only comment was, he reminded me of Adolf Hitler (as a younger man). Plot was maybe a little over done, but still worth the price."
3,Radcliffe superb,"Buy this for Radcliffe's acting job. He is really superb. The final scene of his death is a tour de force of acting that should put to rest any doubts about the young man's abilities. One of the most heartrending death scenes ever filmed. Haig is a bit over the top as Kipling, but tolerable. Igive it four stars but for some reason Amazon won't let me do that."
4,Without a glitch,"Had I not known that my burr mill was reconditioned, I would have sworn it was new. It works as it indicated it would, and I am pleased!"
2,Cuisinart Burr Coffe Grinder,"I have purchased ""factory reconditioned"" products before with great success and satisfaction. The previous products were like brand new. This coffee grinder came to me very dirty with coffee grounds as if it had not even been cleaned much less ""reconditioned"". I would have returned it but I live in Guatemala and the grinder was delivered to me by my folks during their vacation. This experience has placed doubt in anymore reconditioned purchases. I must say that the grinder does work fine."
1,remanufactured cuisinart coffee grinder,"I bought one these from another vendor and that one literally fell apart,this one I purchased in Oct. runs but does not grind the coffee ,yes I have tried to clean it if I hold with both hands and shake it like mariachies it will grind some coffee beans , I know my money still out there and its still good and I,m left holding the bag of unground coffee beans !"
3,Where's the spice?,"Having followed Chad Wackerman's career since his days with Zappa, and having seen him perform with Allan Holdsworth in the 80's, I expected a lot more from this disc. Wackerman continues to be among the finest drummers I've heard, but I found the music on this CD to be snooze-inducing. There was just not enough rhythmic variation and dynamic contrast for me, at least not at the time of my listening. All the musicians performed well and I'm sure I would be hard-pressed to duplicate their performance. However, the compositions just seem to be pedestrian and lackluster. I will continue to check out Wackerman's work in the future, though."
5,I love this book,I read this book with my 4 year old grandson. He now sings along with me and I have heard him singing the song while playing. He is learning about his body and thoroughly enjoys this lively book. It brings us together at the end of a long day. I tickle his bones while reading the story and he loves it.
1,This is not a beginner book!,"I ordered this book for my girl friend to learn my native language German. It is completely useless for this purpose. It is basically a workbook having German words and phrases and you will be asked to translate them.But the catch is that it doesn't give you any solutions or vocabulary. In order to have some use for this book you must have some detailed knowledge about the German vocabulary, but in this case the sentences are to easy in order to use it as a preparation for school tests etc.My advise, buy something else. I will have to return it, too."
4,A Ricky Nelson collectible,"This is one of the best DVD's available to show the influence of Ricky Nelson on Rock and Roll music. For those of you who love Ricky Nelson's songs as I do, this DVD is a must. It covers many of his songs from the original OZZIE AND HARRIET tv series and is narrated by his son Gunnar and long time lead guitarist James Burton-recently inducted into the ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME-get this DVD if you want one of the original innovators of Rock and Roll music."
5,Awesome,"This is an awesome product produced with the knowledge and blessing of the family. I am about the age of his children and have always been a big Ricky Nelson Fan. It was nice to see the history and some of the clips that I was not around to see when they first aired. It was also nice to see the love and warmth of his children, who themselves are very talented. I am glad that they are keeping his memory alive! It is also a good history of how far rock and roll has come."
5,Have Fun,"If you are like me and grew up watching the Nelsons on TV then you just have to get this DVD. This DVD is great....... The picture quality is superb and the sound is crystal clear...... What a great trip down memory lane and a nice visit with the Nelson family. I would have paid ten times as much to get this treasure.As a kid, I had two favourite singers.... Elvis Presley and Ricky Nelson. Actually, nothing has changed, they are still my two favourite singers. Until this DVD, it was hard to find vintage Rick Nelson video and I had to be content with audio Cds.Over the years I have bought Rick Nelson records, 8 tracks, cassettes, and now Cds and this DVD. My favourite music memories are, as a child, watching and listening to Ricky Nelson on TV and Radio and recently, as an adult, I think one of my best memories was cruising with my kids in my 63 T-Bird while we were listening to Ricky.Well, I am rambling on here,.............. Just get the DVD and have some fun.Mike"
5,Best ever!,Had been hoping a someone would compile the TV tracks on a DVD. It is a must see for all Rick Nelson fans!
4,Great for beginners or those returning to sketching,I was recommended this book by an instructor and I was not disappointed. It focuses on physical sketching technique (great for beginners/people returning to sketching) and a casual but effective style that is perfect for quick landscape/plant sketches. Not intimidating at all!
5,"Timeless and crystallized, but extremely difficult reading","This book is very rough going for the modern Western reader. The teachings are timeless, but the writing style and context are extremely dated (it was written at least 1300 years ago). I would not recommend this to anyone who is not already very advanced in knowledge of Hinduism and Advaita Vedanta, unless you're simply looking for an unusual reading experience. There are many books just as 'enlightening' (see ""I Am That"" by Nisargadatta Maharaj), and written in a modern context that makes far more sense to the reader of today."
5,"Lots of simple, PRETTY designs","This book was everything I hoped it would be. One thing, it is more of a 'magazine' type book, but still has fabulous pictures in it. I have used two of the beautiful, unique designs in this book as TATTOOS! It has fabulous ultra-feminine desigs that are much better than the run-of-the-mill tribal art or celtic art designs. I also use the designs for scrapbooking. At the price this is offered for, you can't beat it!"
2,too much rambling....,"I really have always enjoyed Loretta Chase, but this book was a big disapointment. The characters seemed to have no connection and the dialog was sometimes difficult to get thru. I actually did not even finish the book, because I really did not care what happened to Esme and Varian. If you want a good book get Lord of Scoundrels, but leave this one on the shelf"
4,A well written How-To by the master of the art.,If you want a hobby and might try sticking a target on the back door and spending your nights throwing cards at it ... you will find this practical guide just as helpful as I did. Fully illustrated with good pictures.
1,Broke within 1 month of use!,"Very simple review - the hair dryer worked fine for a little over a month, then it didn't. SAVE YOUR BOX IF YOU BUY THIS, you may need to return it."
3,"great info, but poorly published","I'm a big fan of Steve Solomon's writing styel and the information and experience he conveys. this book is no exception and it does a great job of building upon the information on composting that is in ""gardening when it counts"", which I highly recommend.The problem with this copy is that it makes multiple references on many pages to figurs and charts that are not printed. It seems the book was designed for viewing on a computer and not everything made it into the paper edition. This problem does not mean the book has no value, but does reduce the value significantly. I still recommend reading it, but would also advise that you find a software edition if possible with the graphics intact."
5,professional & easy to style,"I got two fans. Right pressure and temperature is a switch away. Finish styling at cool low and little bit of high regime, and you get a great natural gloss.My hair is touched (I use for highlights instead of bleaching kits) by Revlon High Dimension (super gloss) cream color gel, it is a WOW"
1,Defective disk,The picture and sound would freeze for 30 or 40 seconds then come back on only to repeat the process. Unexceptable
3,I Have this Watch But It's In Wrong Time Zone,"I recently moved from Detroit to Boston and I can't figure out what time zone I'm in anymore. The watch says one thing and the cable box says one thing but which is correct? I was an hour late to work because of this and I really can't afford to lose my job since I just moved here. Everyone at work says this shouldn't be an issue, but it clearly is."
3,Idiot's Guide is full of errors,"After reading the Amazon reviews for this book, I decided to use it to teach my adult Spanish course. I didn't want a traditional text, rather a phrase book that students could also take with them on their travels. The overall layout of the chapters appealed to me and the material seemed useful. Although the chapter online looks good, I am discovering lots of errors in other chapters, such as the one on food. Some errors seem to be typos (conjugating ""tienen"" as ""tienan.)"" While others, like listing ""cucurbitacea"" for ""squash"" seem to show ignorance of the language. I would like to warn people who wish to use this book to learn Spanish on their own, that the information may ""look"" good, but don't trust everything to be correct."
1,Run. Away. Fast.,"This video is based on a balletic interpretation of Dracula done by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet of Canada. It is, in my opinion, the most confusing ,senseless, useless piece of cinematic dreck I have ever seen. I challenge anyone - and I am perfectly serious - to make any sense out of or construct what even in the most ludicrous sense of the word could be defined as a narrative line out of this mess. In short, it is awful and I'm sorry I spent even a dime on it. I once worked for the ballet company and the ballet itself is marvelous. BTW, the rating star is a lie. It isn't even worth that."
5,An eclectic Dracula,"I only bought this DVD because I have a Dracula DVD collection and I thought it would be nice to have a ballet production of the novel.However ony a few minutes after it begins, you start to notice that you are in for something big and meaningful.You start to notice the little details that reminisce Murnau's style or Tod Borwning's and even Coppola's.After a little longer the details begin to give shape to a nice homage to almost every cinematic Dracula.The use of certain ballet techniques only enrich and makes more enjoyable what is already a good production that has just a couple of minor flaws such as the post-production special effects.In the end I felt this was one of the best most poetic Draculas ever made that uses the spectator's visual knowledge of the Dracula's films of old as a starting point to then explore virgin aspects of the novel that had never been visited before."
2,A Dissapointment,"I was SO looking forward to this one because I love silents and my favorite talkie genre is The Haunted House. This one is b o r i n g. The print, however, is gorgeous..."
1,Was great for two weeks,"This dryer was great for exactly two weeks, after which it just stopped working completely. Don't bother."
1,DO NOT BUY,I only had this hairdryer for 7 months when it suddenly would over heat and shut itself off after more than 5 minutes of use. Was good until it quit on me but I think a hair dryer should last at least 2 years.
1,Grange House,"I was so disappointed. I really liked The Postmistress and Grange House was a never-ending torture. Because I was taught to be hopeful, I kept hoping it would become less cumbersome and less overly wrought. No luck. Just to get to the end I skipped entire pages. The characters were cut outs; the plot thickening; the descriptions unbearable. Oh well, onward..."
3,Tough to grasp....,"I bought this b/c I loved 'The Postmistress' by the same author. This book was incredibly intricate & difficult to 'get into.' Much of the time I couldn't figure out what was going on. I like a book that grabs me from the get-go, but this didn't. I gave it a chance, though, & after about 1/4 of the way through I couldn't put it down. I was going to finish this book if it killed me. Once the 'story' came out, 3/4 of the way through, I was determined. The ultimate plot was an interesting one, but I think the book would have much better if the author would have just come right out & written what was going on instead of hinting at things."
3,Is There An Editor in the House?,"Is there any end to the number of pitfalls in writing? I just finished Sarah Blake's ""Grange House,"" and she has aggrevated me on various levels.The book needs editing. Although the writing is good, I kept thinking, ""Where is the ending?""Ms. Blake loves the word ""cupped."" She must have used it fifty times in 360 pages. I began looking for ""cupped"" the way you listen for a tic in the speech of someone who bores you. Someone should have repaired this.The author held me prisoner, then pulled the oldest trick in the book (pun intended), as I expected: reversed identities.The story takes place circa 1900, and the author's attempt at Victorian speech is jarring. I noticed she holds a doctorate in Victorian lit.; no doubt she wanted to demonstrate how very much Victorian literature she's had to read.The art of storytelling seems to me like the art of teaching. Many are called, but damned few are chosen."
3,A Bit Uneven,"When I first started reading Grange House, I must admit, it irritated me. The narrative was all caught up in this eerie, mystical mood thing that seemed very, very forced. Then, about halfway through the novel, things picked up. The ghost story aspect of it all was more natural and the story itself became engrossing. The mystery of Miss Grange, or who the mother of the young heroine is actually got to be quite compelling. I am not certain the ending compensated for the silliness of the first part of the novel, so I would advise to proceed with caution."
4,Great Strategy Guide For The PS2 Game!,"This strategy guide is pretty well made for the ps2 game ""Devil May Cry"".....although there is a few things that are hard to understand, overall, it's a great guide to play the game. I would recommend it for beginners of the game like me. Have fun and enjoy the guide cause I did!"
2,Covers to many systems with not enough depth.,I was excited too see my very own Weil-McClain heating system pictured through-out the book. What I didn't find out is how it really worked or how to troubleshoot it. Safety is the author's first concern and first chapter in the book. I could find nothing explaining how to correct the excess pressure causing my safety valve to drip at times.
1,NO HELP AT ALL!,THIS IS A BIG WASTE OF MONEY.I HAVE MY DOUBTS THIS MAN IS AN ENGINEER.I USUALLY SAY I CAN LEARN FROM ANY ONE.NOT THIS GUY.HE TELLS YOU THIS IS A WINDOW UNIT THIS IS AN OIL BURNER.THERE IS NOTHING TO LEARN FROM THIS BOOK.I HOPE I CAN GIVE IT AWAY.IT TOOK ME 15 MINUTES OF READING THEN I QUIT.IT WOULD COST ME 4 DOLLARS TO SEND IT BACK.IT IS SEVERLY OUTDATED!IF YOU JUST WANT TO LOOK AT OLD PICTURES AND BAD LITURE THEN BUY IT.WHAT A BIG WASTE OF A GOOD TREE! TONY PHILA.PA.
1,Battery Stinks,"I guess I should have read some reviews before purchasing this phone...As others have said, the battery life is terrible. I thought I was getting a good deal at $20 but this is another case of you get what you pay for."
1,Worst phone Worse Service ever,"I purchased this phone with minutes on June 12. On June 21, I called Virgin Mobile because phone would not stay charged. Replacement phone received June 26. Activated replacement phone July 1, after 1 week, the exact same problem -- phone does NOT stay charged. Called Virgin Mobile again. Told me nothing wrong!! Box states standby charge = 9 days. Phone only stays charged 36 hours without use! Virgin Mobile NOT sympathetic, said nothing they can do, REFUSED to refund money for phone or minutes. Said we can only send you another replacement. Said it was ""normal"" to charge every night. I said ""false advertising?"" Virgin mobile: no comment. By the way, the service area for my location is fair to good. NO reason for battery draining all the time except its a piece of pure junk. Overall review is F- don't waste your time"
2,Not a great phone,Battery really dies quickly even though there aren't many features to the phone. Easy to use phone and I like it but must be charged daily. I love virgin mobile and bought the Wildcard and love it.
2,Too bad about the battery...,"Everything the other reviewers say is true. The phone is ""basic"" but it does everything I need it to do (and more). Unfortunately, the battery life is pathetic. I thought I had a defective battery, but after reading the other reviews, the dismal battery performance appears to be par for the course. Guess I'll be looking for another phone."
1,Don't buy this Junk!,"I've never been so disappointed in a product than this blu-ray player from samsung, what a piece of junk. I returned mine and got a Toshiba HD DVD player and haven't looked back, the Toshiba HD-A1 is an awesome player!!"
4,Great PQ,"I just upgraded from a Sony upconvert dvd player and installed the latest firmware (1.1) before I even started.Popped in Casino Royale blu ray and was amazed, it looks like I'm sitting at the movies, all of the softness is gone that the upconvert dvd player would display. As far as SD DVD's go, the upconverter in this player is also better than my sony was. For $500 I'm happy. Few points:*) Upgrade the firmware as soon as your get it*) If I would have paid $900 I probably would have been slightly disappointed because I'm already spoiled by HDTV. At $500, I am finally enjoying HD quality on my Netflix movies.*) The second gen is coming out soon, but if you don't have a 1080P tv or HDMI 1.3, then go for this one as it will be $300 less.*) Many of the earlier reviews about soft picture and not playing discs WERE correct, this has been corrected by the firmware updates.*) BUY IT!"
1,PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COST!,"I have this player I would strongly state that you not purchase unless you $300.00 to spend what is really a ""beefed up DVD player"". It won't play any blu-ray discs past March of this year. I have called their ""customer service"" countless times with no resolution. They will not provide you with any up to date firmware nor any real support. The last rep I spoke to laughed at me. So do yourself a favor and shop for another brand. This is a big waste of money."
1,Disappointed,"Wow for $1,000.00 I thought this would have been the best player I could ever get. I was looking forward to seeing everything I have read about this new format.The picture was slightly better then my old regular dvd player but defintely not a big differnce. My dvd player cost $100 and this $1,000New models are soon to be coming out for blu ray and are set to be even more expensive $1,000 - $1,800The Toshiba HD DVD player for $500 actually had a way better picture then this blu ray format for $1,000.For double the price you better show me double the picture qualityI returned the samsung and purchased an Toshiba HD DVD player."
1,Do not buy this book,"One of the worst books I read. It uses many pages to explain what to click and how to proceed without giving any meaningful and indepth information. Also, the click guidance is incorrect since it applies for a different version of jbuilder. It is supposed to be a textbook (with excercises) to teach university 101 courses. Thanks God I am not in Mr Liangs's class."
4,Also available on audio cassette,"Although the linkage does not currently show up on this Amazon product page, this album is also available on audio cassette. See ASN B00000EPEK."
3,This book has TMI (Too Much Information) For Younger Girls!,"While this book has its positive points, Dr. Brody goes into much detail about a young girl's sexuality, some inappropriate for younger ages. Consequently, those who hope to protect their children from this subject need to be forewarned.While it has many good topics of interest, it also covers such topics as: masturbation, male arousal, intercourse, anal intercourse, birth control, pregnancy, abortion, date rape, and oral sex.When my 9 yo daughter, enticed by the snazzy cover, brought this home from the library, I had NO IDEA this information was inside. It's entirely too much information for a young child this age.Please be very careful when your daughters bring home books that look innocently like high-level introductions to a girl's sexuality. Please preview them. Otherwise, they may be introduced to subjects they don't need to know about at their young age."
4,Not that bad,"This book compared to his last book he written was way better. This book points out the error in Sunday Christianity and how it adopted many pagan beliefs into its own system to please the pagans. As Constantine once said One Empire, one Emperor, and one Religion the easist way to get religion is how it is combind to fit the role of the peoples needs, and makes it much easier to control the masses.Other then that it has better sorces then his next book."
2,"Fascinating story, but not a particularly interesting book","I'm not a fan of true crime, and this book didn't do a thing for me. It struck me as material for a potentially fascinating magazine article that unwisely got stretched into a book. The writing style made me feel as though I were always at arm's length from the story. To compound this problem, none of the major figures in the story was particularly appealing -- both victims and oppressors were clearly nuts. The only point of the book seemed to be that the sort of whackos we read about in the news today thrived in the 19th century as well."
2,I was disappointed,"I bought this book after reading the glowing reviews it received at this web site.I bought this book expecting something as hard-to-put down, as chilling, and as memorable as ""In Cold Blood"".I was disappointed.The book, although not bad, wasn't great, either. The progression of the book was too uneven.I thought transitions were poor, and, like another reviewer mentioned, it was missing something..."
5,STARVATION HEIGHTS,tHIS BOOK WILL KEEP YOU WANTING TO GO TO THE END. I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW AND WHY SHE DID THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED NOT ONLY TO THE WILLIAMSON SISTERS BUT TO SO MANY OTHERS HOW SHE TOLD THE NURSE SHE NEEDED A BIIGGER PAN BECAUSE SHE WAS CUTTING THE ONE VICTIM IN PIECES. MUST READ.
2,Less True Crime Than Novelization,"Though the book was entertaining, it contained so much imaginary dialog and dramatization as to qualify more as a novelization of events rather than an actual accounting. I also found that the author had a habit of using tortured similes which I found distracting. The story was moderately entertaining but I don't think I will try another by him."
3,Must be a small collection.,"I bought a copy of this calendar for three years or so, until I realized that they use the same photos over and over. Must be a small collection; god knows there are 80 bazillion calaveras out there to choose from."
3,"I really wanted to love this book, but...","I merely liked it. (The cover helped seduce me into buying it!) I found it difficult to keep up with which generation's ""Mother"" was being referred to and which generation's ""kids"" were acting up. Just too many people for my feeble brain to keep straight. And I would like to say that I did not appreciate the review where the plastic sword thing was mentioned. When I actually came to that in the book, it didn't phase me--I took it as good-natured hyperbole. I was furious with the reviewer for spoiling the natural flow of the story for me. There are good, good things in this book--I would recommend it. But I can't give it four stars, sorry."
2,Out of date XSL material,"If you are looking for info on XSL, don't stop here. The information in this book is far out of date for the IE5 implementation of XML/XSL."
3,GREY MOVIE,"A historic fact of FBI neutralizing the bank robbers/murderers is screened by depicting a sort of agents' unpreparedness to a fire exchange.A very grey movie, actually, with a very confusing title."
4,movie,this is a good movie to watch especially if you are in law enforecment or just like good movies this is one to watch
4,Great Manga!!!!!!,"I'm 14 years old, and an avid manga fanatic. I borrowed this book from my friend a while ago. Reading the description, I didn't think it would be that great of a series, but after reading it, I fell in love with it. The storyline is funny, although sometimes dramatic. Yamada is an interesting character, and usually provides some laugh-out-loud moments. Such as, during an arguement with Nao-chan, he proposes to the back of her neck!! I would actually give this 4.5 stars, but since Amazon only has whole stars, I went with 4. Oh, and just a note, this book is not for those who don't like reading about blood, seeing as there are some rather...violent scenes involved."
5,Great Portable Dictionary,"This is a great portable dictionary. I loved the raised keypad and the easy to read display. The clip on the back also holds it securely on the page and I am not constantly worried about it falling out of the book. The other neat thing is that it also has a conversion feature from metric to US measurements for when I'm cooking. And in case you forget how to use the thing, they've printed the instructions on the back! I love my dictionary!"
4,Gentlemen prefer blondes.,"This is a fine collection of ""girl singers"" from the ""bachelor pad"" era. This disc spotlights blondes. There is another CD that features brunettes. There isn't a redheads disc, probably because there aren't enough songs by redheads to fill a CD. Anyway, the disc at hand features a lot of fine blonde singers. Everybody knows Doris Day, Peggy Lee, Marilyn Monroe and Julie London, but you also get lesser known girls like Diana Dors, Paula Castle and Marilyn Maxwell. If you are interested in girl singers who can really swing, you should pick up this CD."
5,"Movie about the boys and the adults, but it reveals much about Johann Sebastian Bach","Best movie for me because it adds a dimension into understanding Johann Sebastian Bach. If you are not turned on by Bach's music, don't watch this movie because it would not make any sense at all!"
4,inspiration and healing,"The lyrics of these songs are replete with honesty and poetry. Paul has shared the struggles of his soul in these songs. The music is interesting, well-crafted and sometimes unpredictable. Sometimes it is uplifting, sometimes reflective, but always rendered with artistry. I listened to Paul Clark in his early days and his trademark sound is still there, but there is diversity as well. Influences ranging from Beatlesque to native American are present. The genre would likely be considered pop, but it is not in any way shallow or boring. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates honesty in artistry, to anyone who has been wounded in the journey of life. It is inspiring and healing."
5,You want this album! You really do!,And you REALLY want to see these guys live!!!! www.myspace.com/larusso
2,Outdated?,"BEWARE! As I was thumbing through the pages of this dictionary, I happened upon a list of the Presidents of the United States and their respective wives. I noticed that the list ended at Jimmy Carter. No Reagan, Bush, Clinton or W! Went to see when the book was originally published and saw that it was first released in 1979. Re-released in 2003 & then in 2006. I wonder if Bantam just released the whole entire dictionary ""un-updated"" since 1979. Who knows what else needs updating in this book. Didn't think a respected company like Bantam would do such a thing, put out outdated info."
3,"Forgettable, yet still underrated","First of all, the name ""Trevor McFur"" rates among the stupidest names in video game history. Not only is the name a blatant rip off of Fox McCloud, but this game actually takes everything it can from Starfox without violating any copyrights, other than the gameplay. The graphics are hit and miss, but mostly hit as the digitized renders are gorgeous and the bosses are huge and detailed. I also enjoyed the gameplay, which demands you to beat all five stages in one sitting with limited continues, but keeps track of your high scores and radiates with an old school charm with plenty of powerups and special moves. Kind of like Gradius except it's not impossible. This games biggest problem is the stupid, poor man's Star Fox presentation, with the photoshopped lion general giving you obnoxious briefings, exc, exc."
3,Just What I needed,Just what I needed to help launch my home inspection business. All the forms I could ever need to use.
3,An academic book...,"To be honest, I have only just begun to read this book. On first glance at the table of context you see that Washofsky intends to fit as much as possible into one volume, which was the reason for my purchase. Once I got it and looked through it a bit, I noticed a thing or two missing. For example, he speaks of homosexual relationships and premarital sex but completely ignores marriage between a Jew and a non-Jew (as far as I have found so far). That isn't too big of a deal, but it was something I wanted to read about and I was disappointed that it wasn't in this book.I gave the book 3 stars because it is subtitled ""a guide to contemporary reform practice"" which leads the purchaser to believe that it is a good place to start, but Washofsky writes in an extremely academic manner. For the beginner to Judaism, I would recommend starting with Essential Judaism by George Robinson and moving to Jewish Living when you are further along in your studies."
1,Quick Change Stripped First Time,"I've had excellent luck with Porter Cable tools over the years, in fact most of my tools are Porter Cable. Unfortunately this one didn't live up to my expectations. The first time I tried to remove the blade using the ""Quick Change"" bolt it stripped out. Other than that the saw performed fine. Called Porter Cable and they said they've had problems with the quick change device. Offered to send a new quick change or a standard bolt. I opted for the standard."
5,"LOVE, LOVE","THIS CURLING IRON IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WORKS FOR ME, I HAVE VERYSHORT HAIR. OTHER IRONS, MY HAIR SLIDES RIGHT OUT WITHOUT CURLING.WISH I COULD FIND A FEW MORE FOR WORK, AND TRAVEL."
4,"i had fun! scored 12, of course..lol ;-~~~~","HAD SEEN SOME OF THESE BEFORE, I MUST ADMIT, BUT STILL IT WAS FUN...HAD A BIT OF A TIME OVER THE MAN MARRYING HIS WIDOW'S SIS THO..HAD TO THINK AT FIRST, WHY THE HELL NOT?? THEN I REALIZED..DUH! FUN TEST!"
5,"Fun, fun, fun....but too easy to ----->","I didn't get the score I liked on your test, so I resubmitted and got 12 of 12 after I saw your answers! Pretty cool, huh? Then I printed it out and will show it to someone who keeps calling me dumb!"
5,This song is really good because it gets you going.,"It's fresh and lively and I love to play it when my friends come over and if we are in a disco o'r party and it comes on it seems to get everyone going, lets just hope their not going to die off like many other bands and groups like these who try to enter the tough world of modern pop."
4,I think S Club 7 is great band. I like their music.,"I like the way S Club 7 dances. I think S Club 7, *N Sync and B* Witched dance the best. It's just amazing how much energy they have and how well they dance. And their TV show is ok. But if you watch from like 6:30 in the morning til like 7:30, the song gets stuck in your head and it can drive you crazy. Well for some people. But I am not saying that, that is a bad thing."
5,A Magical Mystery Tale,"Vivid characters and a compelling story keep the pages turning in this fascinating trip to the Old West, where the mysteries of ancient folklore still shape people's destinies, and where love is still the greatest mystery of all."
1,No memory,"I got Play it now for christmas. I taped a few songs. It worked fine, until I tried to erase the songs I was tired of. It can't be done. It keeps saying ""memory full"" I read a few other reviews, and it seems Im not the only one this happened too. Other that that I loved play it now. It was really easy to work. But it was temporary. If anyone can figure it out, wire a review for us and tell us. Thank you"
2,piece of junk,"I got this toy for my 11th birthday and after the summer, it says i cant download any more songs.So i recommend that you dont buy this PIECE OF JUNK."
5,A great companion for the phsychiatric trainee.,"This book deserves everyone of the five stars because: 1. It is comrehensive for general issues in child psychiatry. 2. It is written in very clear language, even for people like me who's mothertounge is not English. 3. It is very practical as it gives good clinical examples. 4. It is fun to read because of the clinical examples. 5.It is not too long or extensive so it is manageable to read and good for quick refferals.This book is a must for every phsychiatry trainee and all others that are interested in children's mental health."
2,baseboard heater,I wish I knew it required a 220 line before I bought it!! I really can't rate it because I can't use it...
5,If you want to know Munch,"I could not put this book down and when I finished, I felt as though I finally had some insight into Munch as a person as well as an artist. If you would like to have a better understanding of both the man and his paintings this book is for you."
4,Nice laptop,"Dear Review,Nice laptop for a student like me. I did understand that I needed a memory enhancement. However, I did not not understand that it didn't have Microsoft Office. But that is OK. For the price it was a bargain.And the best thing is I could get it myself on credit.Sincerely,Catherine Jarvis"
3,No one-handed operation,"Just got this knife hoping to find a small blade for field work where I do a lot of repetitive cutting with one hand while holding something in the other. The stud on this knife won't open under thumb pressure - you have to use your opposite hand to open it. This is a fine little knife with good steel, but there's no reason for this design quirk that decreases its versatility."
2,"Well, I read it.","My son encouraged me to read this prior to the Y2K thing. It was interesting and I did some preparation such as water, candles, and a full cupboard. But, basically, I found this to be a little too radical for my taste. Of course, when 1-1-2000/1-1-2001 passed, I felt a little smug when compared to my friends who were a wreck about ""what could happen"" if all the computers crashed, etc. If you are into being self sufficient, read it. Otherwise, pass it on to someone else who can tell you about it when they are done."
3,not great,I expected better from the Swingline family. This hole punch sticks and doesn't retract properly. I wasn't overloading the hole punch either. Perhaps I just got a bum model.
4,Well-researched and thorough,"Although this is an upper division or graduate level text, it is also an excellent book for the novice because after concepts are introduced, considerable time is taken to develop them in an accessible manner.This book would be useful for chemical engineers, chemists, metallurgists, mechanical engineers, civil engineers, and structural engineers. It covers all aspects of polymeric materials, including their chemistry, structure, synthesis, properties and processing.There are adequate references to allow the reader to delve more deeply into any of these subjects. This book is very well researched, well written and thorough."
5,Unbelievably great.,I have used several different fleur de sels and hands down this is the best one. Goes great with everything. I highly recommend this brand.
2,Missing Panels: poor edition,"Between pages 29 to 31 -- there's an arrival, a recognition, and a gift of the porpentine. None of those panels make it into this edition, and they are important to the story.I ordered this to replace my prior copy, which got soaked. I'm disappointed. I love the story, but not the changes."
4,Interesting story,"I did not feel this was one of the better story arcs, but it is still an interesting one, and we see the reappearance of Barbie from Volume 2 of this series. We also get to meet a really cool character, Thessaly, who would appear in a few stories of her own later. I wish this story could have been explored more, I mean, I would have loved to learn more about the Sandman's past with Alianora, so for that, I can only give this installment 4 stars."
5,The Best Sandman Story by this Point,"It saddens me that people who are not intelligent enough to understand something feel the need to trash it. This is the best Sandman story up until the time it was published. It is arguably the most emotional and seems to be the first to develop one theme with each word and picture--in this case, identity. Read all of the Sandman stories that came before and then read this one."
5,Great story,"This book is full of adventure, it could be an entire series. Highly recommended to anyone who likes a good sea story."
5,It will make you feel in MINT CONDITION!!,"This product is absolutely delicious!!! I cannot get this tea in my neighborhood anymore. Lipton says that it doesn't sell as well as the other herbal teas, and they have removed it from the grocery shelves. So, I decided to search for it on the net, and I found it. Hooray!!! I will continue to buy it from this seller. The delivery was Super Fast!!Thanks again."
2,Not for me.,"Personally, this was not strong enough for me. I found it weak. I think Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow Peppermint is much stronger and better for me."
2,Keep the mask on and the clothes,"Guys Gone Wild--The Big Easy was not easy on the eyes. The first couple of scenes the guys are hot however as the show progesses the ""hot"" factor hits zero and you wish they would be wearing the mask at Mardi Gras and all their clothes. I was hoping for more shots of guys on the street flashsing to the crowd. What should have been the highlight of the movie was a guy shooting his seed, however it turned out having the feel of sleaze and desperation. The best of the series is the original, save your money because these guys are anything but wild, more like EASY prey."
3,thanks,"My first of this line of movies. It's okay, but kinda cheesy and not what I expected it to be"
3,"Product was fine, but there are a few problems","The tree itself was beautiful, and arrived in good shape with no damage. However, the soil was very dry upon arrival, so I'm hoping that this will not cause any long-term damages to the tree. Also, as others have said, the pool part seems to leak water into the plant part. Its not a major problem, but it just means that what you get will not look like the picture.What really upset me though, was that the seller neglected to gift-wrap my package and add a card, even though I asked for it in the shipping instructions/options. I realize that this is not that huge of a deal, but I wanted to give this item as a gift, with a nice thoughtful card, which clearly did not happen."
4,Good tree! Missing parts,"The tree and everything else was beautiful and unbroken, the only complaint I have is that the fisherman was missing his pole!"
5,great,"looks a little different than the one advertised in the picture, looks younger i think, but overall awesome product.came perfectly wrapped and intact with fast shipping. my little bonsai is doing great, thank!"
3,Smaller then I thought it would be,"The tree is in healthy shape so far, but it much smaller then it appeared to be in picture. A few things were broke a pond arrival but I glued them back on. This is the 2nd tree I bought from this company, the first was cheaper and even smaller, so I decided to pay a little more in hope of a bigger, better tree. Too bad that didn't happen,"
2,"Not a recommendation to just put on display, needs some care.","I have pretty much decided that the Juniper received is very pruned to look like a Bonsai.The grumbles:1. Tree is sitting in a pot that leaks if you add water which then causes the soil to be super saturated with water. So recommend getting a new pot.2. Was planted in normal potting soil. So you will need to immediately re-plant in appropriate soil that allows for drainage.3. I ended up bare-rooting the Juniper as there was no taproot and what root structure was in place was rolled up in a dense ball.4. Looks more like a branch clipping with a weak root system.The awesome:1. Juniper looked good with no dead branches.So overall, pretty much disappointed by what I received. Whether or not this is how the vendor ships their product I do not know based on reading other reviews. So my advice is that you should expect to provide some basic care and re-potting and not just put up on a shelf and water."
3,Mildly disappointing,"Tying into DC's Identity Crisis mega event, Flash: The Secret of Barry Allen finds current Flash Wally West uncovering secrets behind long time Flash rogue the Top. As Wally learns just what his late uncle tried to help do to the murderous villain, it becomes apparent that this isn't one of Geoff Johns' better ideas. Other sub-plots taking place in this trade, including the gathering of other Flash rogues to attend the funeral of Captain Boomerang, are actually more interesting than this ""deep, dark"" secret of Barry Allen, as Captain Cold is shown as a force to reckoned with, and a new Captain Boomerang is born. Howard Porter's pencils are solid for the most part, although they seem more cartoony than anything during fight scenes. On it's own, this TPB is worth a read, but don't expect anything special from it."
1,Very disaponting,"When I recieved the product it was almost empty. I'm not sure I received the genuine product. It didn't smell like the original one, nor did it last as long. If I hadn't tosssed the recipt, I would have returned it. It had either faded with age or was a fake version."
4,Great toaster,"I purchased this toaster for my office so I wouldn't have to use the icky toaster ovens that are in the common break room.It's a good toaster. Nothing fancy, but it looks somewhat art-Deco in my office, which I like. It does a good job and has extra-wide slots for bagels and fat toaster pastries. An added bonus is that it makes the office smell like breakfast!"
1,Not a 650 Case but it works,"Looks like there are a lot of companies advertising Treo cases across multiple models that they are not designed for. This is NOT for the 650, it appears that it might be a 7xx series case. However, after slamming it, I have actually found it to be the best silicone case I've used to date! After popping it on and off about 30 times (was in the process of a new Treo case (actual phone case, not a case to go over it) it still fits like Day One. So, for the price it is well worth it. Not a single Treo user has noticed that it is for a 7xx series. If Amazon allowed it, I would move this to 4 stars for a 650 and five stars for a 7xx series Treo."
1,very scary for a child,"I was very disappointed with how this is written. It talks about death, dying, killing, punishing, fighting, etc. It very much is written to instill the ""fear of God"" and it is very frightening for a 3 year old. I would not recommend this."
4,Great Little Book,"Short and sweet stories from the bible simplified, perfect for my child who is almost 6 years old. She now asks me to read from it every night!"
2,Stories are too simplified,"We are not a church going family, but I wanted my son to learn about some of the wonderful stories in the bible that teach such beautiful lessons. I have to say I was rather disappointed in this bible. The stories are simplified to such a degree that you lose some of the meaning. I'm sure this is because it is an easy reader, and simple words must be used. However, if you leave out major parts of the stories, the lesson is lost."
5,Excellent Summer Read!,I teach Reading Recovery for first graders during the school year. This book is EXCELLENT summer reading because it will be mostly easy for the average end of year first grader. Easy = Confidence and fun. The activities and questions at the end of each story will promote deeper meaning and increased overall comprehension skills. Reluctant readers should bloom over the summer and be a step up when walking into the second grade classroom in the fall.
5,Awesome Bible!!,"Wow! We LOVE this Bible!! My daughter is in grade 2 and has been learning reading through phonics. She liked the pictures right away (we have the 1991 version, with different illustrations than the newer Zonderkids publication). She should be able to read just about every word in this Bible with little help, yet also still be challenged with a few new words in each story. At the end of each story is a great little section that includes questions and follow-up activities. In the back is a Story List, which includes Scripture references and the moral & spiritual values learned in each story. There is also a public schools Basic Words List. With each Bible story reading you will find not more than five new words not found on this basic list. The New Words List is also at the back of this Bible. This will make an excellent Bible for her own personal devotions, as well as being a great addition to our homeschool reading materials!"
4,Well Rounded Presentation,"This anthology offers a well-rounded reading list from the world's religion and wisdom traditions. It does, however, provide very few of the troubling texts, instead focusing on the ""kinder, gentler"" readings that are -- happily -- the majority of religious writings. This book coupled with Living Religions (by the same author) provide a solid study in the world's religions."
5,excellent comeback for Trapido,"I really loved this book. I consider it a great rebound from Juggling, which I found rich but almost incomprehensible (disappointing after her rich but thoroughly enjoyable earlier works). Trapido is about as good a writer of prose as there is, lyrical and very funny. She also repeatedly astonishes her readers with deft yet deep character development and striking plot twists. She offers a layered, circling presentation of the events from different points of view; the result is a wonderful reading experience. I was introduced to Trapido by a friend in England, and I'll always be grateful to her because I might never otherwise have become aware of the author, given the scant attention paid to her here."
3,back on track,"Brother of the More Famous Jack, with the delicious Professor Goldman who indulged his younger children in their swearing and grime, the fey posh mother with her love of gardening and music, and the attractive brothers with butterfly patches on jeans and gumboots, was one of my favourite books in my early twenties. As I approach my forties, the brothers and their wives, featured in this sequel, The Travelling Hornplyer, are older too. Reading it was like looking up old friends one hasn't seen since university. This didn't give me quite the same rush of pleasure as the original, but I thought it the best thing Trapido has written since. Maybe because Jonathan has become his father, and that was Trapido's finest character."
5,Worked as expected,"This product was inexpensive, the perfect length, and exactly what I was expecting. Actually, it was more since the image suggests that there is a pin missing (common on some VGA cables), but the cable I received ended up having all 15 pins."
4,Good instruction movie,"It is an great ""how to"" movie on freeheel technique. Not intended for Piste skiers or Nordic skiers. It covers the basics to experts freeriding."
3,OK Biography,"This effort was not on the par with the authors other biographies. There were errors(Hitler committed suicide on April 30 not May 3) and after a great deal of discussion about Ike and Patton, old blood and guts simply vanishes. I would have like more about Eisenhower and the concentration camps as well. Overall, this was an Ok attempt"
2,Save your money,"Although I enjoyed Perret's previous works, this one truely disappoints. The narrative flows poorly and is disjointed in many areas. It provides no new insights in the WWII venue and only gives an ill-conceived overview of Eisenhower's presidency. I felt that I knew no more about Ike as a human being than I did before I finished the work which was supposed to be the strong point of this effort. A great disappointment from an author I have enjoyed immensely in the past."
1,Forget It,I don't know if it the 512 MB of RAM or Windows Vista - but this laptop is slow. The windows vista environment is tough to get used to. The PC was supposed to come with a 60 trial key for MS office - but it didn't. It took a lot of extra effort to obtain the key directly from Microsoft. I recommend that you wait for Microsoft to work the bugs out of Vista. I also recommend that you get a laptop with more memory.
5,ENTERTAINING AND EDUCATIONAL,"This video is so good for my two year old twins. I like the fact that they can see the real animals and not animated or puppet versions. We love the musical ditties that are written specifically for each letter and animal. How the composer came up with so many catchy and unique tunes is amazing. Each tune has its own sound, so the video does not get boring or irritating for the adults when the kids have it on over and over. My kids get so inspired by the footage and music of the Kangaroo and Ostrich, that they immediately hop and run around with the animals. They find the Monkeys so funny. The more I have this video on, the more I am impressed by it. It is a classic. I highly recommend it!"
1,surprised,"I did not realize I was purchasing an item that is not new. The lack of exterior packaging is not a problem for me; however, there was no seal covering the tube opening and the tube was about 1/3 to 1/2 empty. There was no evidence of tampering or leakage, but I did smell the product when I opened the package. Information needed before purchase: item not new, not sealed, not full. I love this product, just not this particular purchase of it."
5,OPium by Yves St Laurent,I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this product. How is it possible to sell it for such a low price? In the past it has been so expensive in the stores and now it is almost impossible to find. This is my favorite fragrance and I am happy to have found it.
2,Another stitched together Public Domain compilation,"This documentary is mearly a cut and stitch of three Public domain short films with about as minimum amount of B-24 Liberator footage as it gets. If you are a modeler or a WWII aviation buff, you've probably seen these films before in some other form or format. My advice to you is give this one a pass."
5,Amazing,"Amazing, sublime, art. Well worth the money. Most of the work contained in this book belong in an art museum. Fantastic. Blew my mind away. Highly recommend it to people, even those not interested in manga."
4,stunning images,"The pictures are great and some of the tales are pretty good. The only downer is that this is definately for adults. There is no way I would ever give this to a kid. Some parts are creepy, like pedophile creepy (EWWW). Very suggestive and some pretty innapropriate images for the youngins. Still like it for the most part though. The Humanity Imortality and Wasteland stories are pretty good. :D"
3,Not quite what I expected...,"Initiately, I brought this book because I thought it is a colored compilation of short stories by various graphic artists. And it is. I had very high hopes for the artistic quality of this book and I admit that the art is beautifully colored, printed on glossy paper, and the quality of the printed images are good. The reason why I give this book three stars is because the content is much less poetic and more hentai/perverted than I expected. Not that all the stories are tastelessly hentai, but some are. I probably won't buy the other volumes in this series."
5,"Great neo ""book o fiction"" - 2","Great compilation of graphic short stories.Fully painted, illustrated, colored masterful works of reading pleasure. I love the Robot series just for the variety of art it contains. From the strong and impactful illustrations for Dragon Fly to the soft and elegant in Eventyr. It's also a pleasure to look upon the background art for House of Fish.On top of the art is of course the wide stretch of storylines. The giant hamster has always stayed in my head, strange, quirky and thoroughly enjoyable. This is not a children's book in any way shape or form. Please bear that in mind.Great genuine artistic work from the east."
1,Exactly the stereotype they are warning against,"Not only is the book poor (well, biased) research, and repetatively (boringly) written, it also is, in itself, the kind of marketing based on girl-stereotypes that it disscusses. It plays off the idea that women are weak (the idea it argues against) by suggesting that girls do not have the strength of mind to see past they stereotypes, and capitalizes off this idea.In addition, it is completely sexist. Unfortunately, our society has come to see anti-male sexism as being acceptable. It's alright for the boys to have stereotypes dictate their lives when they are kids, but not for girls. Girls can be athletes or artists, homemakers or politicians, but, of course, it's not alright for a guy to want to be a stay at home dad or take an interest in drawing, according to the media. By only portraying the female stereotypes as wrong, this book reinforces the male counterpart."
2,"they are too narrow and too long, not good for books","The items included in this package are out of proportion. The length is too long and the width is too small. The seal on the three sides are not very well. If you mail books, don't buy them because the ratio of the width/length is not designed for books."
3,Mankell always delivers,"The story is complex and interesting, as most Mankell fans would expect. I agree that Linda Wallander is somewhat disappointing as a character, and I missed the Kurt/co-workers interactions of the previous books, but the mystery is still gripping.If I'd read the book instead of listening to it, I'm sure I'd rate it with 4 stars instead of three. The narration in the audio version portrays Kurt Wallander not as the complicated, moody, deep thinking & feeling solitary man and policeman of the earlier books, but as a near-monstrous individual, mean, sarcastic, demeaning, even vicious-spirited, and entirely unpleasant. If I hadn't listened to the earlier Wallander novels, this reading of Wallander would turn me off the series completely."
1,Way below his best,"What a disappointment! After thoroughly enjoying the Kurt Wallander novels, I felt really let down by this. I had expected that the switch of main character from Kurt to his daughter Linda would have been a smooth one. But it seems that here, Mankell wanted to write a novel that demonstrated that Christians are every much as capable as Moslems of perpetrating atrocities. Given the historical record, it is hard to argue with that proposition. But the Christian fanatics here were so unbelievable that I was tempted to turn pages whenever their purported beliefs were given an airing. There was simply too much of it. The ending was largely predictable, but I fear that Mankell has left the door open for more of this tedious stuff. To cap it off, there was a totally unnecessary, sickly sweet epilogue."
4,"I'd give the book an A, the translation a C+","The plot is fab, and for the first 3/4 of the book, I couldn't put it down. The ending wasn't a disappointment, but the translation was just so wacky at some points, it really detracted from the story. An outbuilding, for example, is not the same as an outhouse, and while the explanation for the mysterious journal entry works fine in Swedish, in English it was completely ineffective. I think that the use of footnotes would be appropriate in pun-like things. But the book is a very good read regardless."
4,A new twist in the Wallander series,"This book introduces Kurt's daughter, who becomes a cop. It's a little contrived and takes human psychopathology to its logical absurdity. The Wallander books have increasingly dealt with unbelievable psychopaths and this continues in that tradition. I think the depth of depravity of the bad guys takes away from the otherwise riveting nature of the stories."
3,Before the Frost,"Starts with a bang with a piece of historical ickiness in Giana with Jonestown mass murder/suicide and goes on to other grisly events to make one feel properly menaced and enthralled as others die creatively and nastily. The strings of manipulation of the reader are a bit too obvious. Not enough art to conceal the art for my taste. But I read it. It served the purpose of entertainment. Some human depth in the father daughter relationship but not much.Mystery writers have mined the nutty serial killer lode for so long and so often, it's beginning to seem like a failure of creativity, even when it's done well. I long for some rational murders for a change."
2,Loose pages,Very disappointed to find that the first section of the book was loose and immediately fell out. Not possible to lend to friends!
1,Awful,"I couldn't even finish it. I'm a medieval doctoral student with a soft spot for romance novels and I couldn't stand it. Ranulf is cruel without cause or justification. His whole 'tortured' past was way too contrived and I didn't feel for his character at all. I don't find it to be historically accurate in it's treatment of women either, and I've done some extensive research in the area. I was digusted with the so-called hero and wanted nothing more than to see him suffer a lot more then he did. Why and how Ariane fell for him is beyond me.Also, this idea that if a guy is fantastic in bed a woman will forgive him anything? Pisses me off. It isn't true and it's demeaning.Don't buy. Worst romance novel I've ever read."
5,Best Book Ever,"I love the way Nicole Jordon writes the charachters, i can visualize like a movie every line of this book. This book was hard to put down and i could not get the charachters out of my mind. I recommend this book to everyone who wants a Great Read."
3,In the Presence of My Enemies,"This story is one that polarizes the worlds of comfort and deprivation; peace and war. The reader feels part captive as the main characters walk endless miles of dangerous terrain and enter hostile environments on a daily basis. The depth of personal endurance is heroic and inspiring as humble people face illness, isolation, hunger, persecution, and death. The story of grace is one that ultimately wins out as immeasurable pain is dealt upon humans for political pawns."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I thought the subject matter about being taken and held hostage would be very interesting. Indeed, it did start out to be very engaging. However, it then went into too much information about how her family life was centered around the church.....and that's when I put it down, and have not bothered to continue to read her story. Perhaps I will fast forward through the previously mentioned part and see if it gets any better. If I do, I will continue with this revue."
5,In the presence of my ememies,"A very brave author. Very well written and a story that needed to be told, couldn't put it down, a real test of faith."
3,Good music,"When I bought this DVD, I thought I was buying a real DVD, not a ""concert"" DVD which is really what this is. My nephew enjoyed listening to the music and watching the Imagination Movers sing, but was disappointed it was not a show. I wish they wrote in the description that it was just songs and not the actual show."
2,Not like the TV show,"My daughter really likes the songs on the TV show so I got this DVD and it just isn't the same. It's older because the guys all look younger. The Video is not what I expected. Compared to a Wiggles DVD this one looks a little ""home-made"". The overall video is entertaining and has a lot of songs, but most of the video is a live in concert type show. Very catchy tunes but I was just expecting something different."
2,Move and Groove with Noodlebug,"The DVD I received was very poor quality-constantly displayed pixals and skipped. Also, this DVD is just a compilation of songs from the other Noodlebug videos."
1,totally expensive,"I could not believe that I got sucked into the marketing of this product. First, I purchased the pads for 45 dollars, not knowing that I also needed the activator. Secondly, I purchased the activator (what good are the pads without that?) and noticed NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER. I would recommend preparation H before this stuff!"
5,Great Product,"I've always had a fascination with the German language and studied it for three years in high school. Now, almost 40 years later I decided it was time to relearn it since I was sure I had forgotten most of what I had learned. My intention was to only do German I until I finished it. It was so enjoyable and immersive that I decided to go on to German II as well. Well, it looks like I'm about to move on to German III. This course is easy to do and the Pimsleur method makes it impossible not to learn if you listen to the CD's. The authors imply that 30 minutes a day is all it takes and that you can finish the course rapidly. Well, that's not necessarily so. Yes, each lesson is about 30 minutes or less but you will probably have to listen to each one two or three times to make sure you've grasped what's being taught. Especially in German II. Even so, you will be speaking German in no time. Not like a native speaker but close enough until you move on to the higher levels."
1,JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOWS PHP BUT NOT FLASH BEGUINERS***READ THIS BEFORE PURCHASING,"THE BOOK IS EASY TO FOLLOW BUT THE FLASH DESIGNS HAVE TO BE DOWNLOADED SO COMMONSENCE IS IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE THING AND THE BOOK DONT TEACH YOU TO DO IT YOURSELF THEN YOU DINT LEARN ANYTHING,,,, YOU WILL LEARN PHP BUT I ALLREADY KNEW PHP SO I GOT THIS TO LEARN FLASH***THE PHP FOR FLASH PREVIOUST TO THIS IS BETTER SINCE YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR OWN FLASH BUTTONS STEP BY STEP SO YOU CAN LEARN, IF ITS TO LEARN FLASH I COULD GIVE A 0 STARS BUT FOR PHP I COULD GIVE 6 STARS OUT OF 5,,,,, ONE LAST THING IM JUST RATING THIS ACCORDING TO FLASH SO I GAVE 1 BECAUSE THE WEBSITE DONT PERMIT ME TO GIVE CERO"
4,The Goddess,"This film is excellent. Kim Stanley was one of the greatest actresses ever in Hollywood. If you get a chance to see any of her work, do it!"
2,Ugly Truth Featurette,"Not worth your time. I thought this would offer some insight, but just another studio fluff piece. Just another PR stunt."
3,Disappointed,"I moved this program onto my office PowerMac (7300 running MacOS 8.1)) and my home iMac 333 (running MacOS 8.6), and it doesn't work very well ... it loves System 6.x.x, and maybe 7.x.x ... getting error messages such as ""Calendarmaker unexpectedly quit due to a -??? error"". It lets me create calendar pages, but when I try to reopen and edit those pages, I get the error messages"
3,generally useful,"While highly detailed on many aspects of upholstery, there are some glaring gaps, which forced me to seek additional information in other books. Also, the photographic reproduction in this book is rather poor, making some of the photos barely discernible."
1,Russ,"It is completely useless book. It has many old pictures that basically useless b/s given without sequence of steps, show the old type of fabric, has a lot of general information, that you wouldn't need if you want to learn upholstery. I am sure there are better books out there."
5,devil dogs wife,"LOVE this cookbook!I have made many of the dips,for my Bunco group--and I ALWAYS get a rave review. The pasta dishes have gotten equally good reviews from my family too! It is so terrific, that I ordered several copies to give as Christmas gifts this year."
1,A distortion of Christiany and the Bible,"Ham would like us to believe that his ""interpretation"" of the bible is the literal and widely accepted one. It is not. His ""young-earth"" beliefs are liberal and unfounded at best. He gets it right that evolution is wrong, but his emotional hand-waving doesn't convince anyone that Earth is young. He continuely decieves the public and Christians whom refuse to examine what he says. Why do so many people believe blindly? Ham has no experience in the sciences that prove him wrong. What is his authority? For a biblical, literal, and factually founded study of Genesis, read ""The Genesis Question"" by Hugh Ross. No emotionalism, personal philosophies and illogic, only facts and the inerrant Bible."
5,How to stop tears.,Well paced and easy to read. This will save you plenty of tears as the writers have alresdy been there. A must for all AS400 users.
1,very disappointing,"I don't think I will ever read another Kat Martin's book. Her first book I read was ""devil's prize"" and I really enjoyed it. I thought I discovered a new favourite author and rushed out to buy a stack of her books like ""nothing but velvet"", ""sweet vengeance"", ""dangerous passion"", ""innocence undone"", but they were all somewhat a disappointment (I have had ""innocence undone for more than 6 months and still haven't finished it). When this book came out, I though the story sounded interesting and decided to give the author another try. What a let down! The plot was so boring that it took me a month and many settings to finish it. The charactors were poorly drawn, I did not feel I knew the hero or the heroine, I did not feel there was any chemistry between them, I could not be convinced that they had any strong feeling (let alone love) for each other. And if I ever read another book with a petite red-head heroine, I am going to scream."
1,Not really worth your time or money,Lots of bands who were hyped during the short so-called Britpop era found themselfs in the awkard place of not knowing how to sound after the end of it . Shed Seven were one of these bands . The british media tried to promote them furiously yet failed because there wasn't simply anything really good about them to mark out . Forgetable voice and melodies which would sound fine as a backround listening under certain circumanstances yet fail to capture ones attention . Britpop has some good bands to present yet the english groups you must discover are those who created their own sound-style such as Portishead .
5,Essential for Deep Study,This dictionary has proven itself valuable for group Bible studies like Kay Arthur and BSF. A library staple for our permanent family library.
3,in reply to mr Beaudry,"not on par with "" mel torme and friends"".but only in content.sound fine. great value.i boughtit, i like it!"
2,Hope the book is better than the blurb,"As someone who's interested in the larger connections between Superman and mythology, I decided to give this book a look. After checking out this page, I have to hope that the book has better research than the description suggests. What stands out to me is the claim that Superman's parents were originally named ""Mary"" and ""Joseph,"" which is not simply incorrect, but suggests a profound ignorance of Superman's creators' Jewish faith. The original names given to the Kents were ""John"" and ""Mary;"" later revisions included ""Eben"" and ""Sarah"" and the modern ""Jonathan"" and ""Martha.""That entire bit of information is so readily available online and in print sources that the description's error makes me wonder if this book isn't simply twisting facts and fabricating details to strengthen the case for Superman as a Christ figure--a case that barely needs strengthening in the first place. Consequently, it looks like this will be one resource I pass on."
2,Author cherry-picks to get results,"The author had a great idea, but he cherry-picked the available info about Superman and the writers to get the book to make sense. For example, Superman was originally written as a metaphor for Jews during WW2. Two Jewish guys, right at the end of WW2, write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b/c it's destroyed... etc, etc.I'm not critiscizing this book b/c it has a religious message. I'm critiscizing it b/c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement. Otherwise, I disagree with anybody that says it is ""just a comic."" Superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of America."
2,not necessary to supply notes as the matter is simple?,"The book preface says that it isn't necessary to supply notes as the matter is simple and students can begin reading at a very early stage. After two years of A's in Spanish at the college level I find this book very challenging. I get the general gist of the text, but am far from getting every word. Begin reading with this text at a very early stage? Don't think so."
3,easy reader,This book is perfect for a Spanish speaker who needs to read to refresh her language skills. It is easy to pick up and put down as need be. I highly recommend it.
1,unsatisfied mommy,"The cool alert is not good!!!!.... it caused red itchy bumps in my daughter's diaper area. I thought it was a diaper rash, so I used desitin which helped with the discomfort, but after a week & a doctor's visit I realized that the only new thing that was changed with her pull ups was the cool alert. My two year old was soo uncomfortable that she refused to put on the pullup. We continued to use the oringinal."
2,Caused diaper rash,"I tried these out because of the ""Coolness Alert"" feature. That didn't seem to deter my daughter from going in her pants any more than regular pull ups. Also, she has never had diaper rash until using this product. Maybe sensitive to whatever makes them cool? They also constantly ride down leaving her with plumber's crack. I've decided to just try regular underwear and stock up on laundry soap."
1,Cool Alert Allergy Alert,"Not recommended for sensitive skin! We've used Pull-Ups in the past, through Subscribe & Save. They switched to this type, and I didn't think anything of it until my daughter kept coming home from school with severe burn-like rashes. Any time she had accidents in these Pull-Ups, particularly if there was any trace of a bowel movement, her skin broke out in a strange way, not quite diaper rash, but more like a chemical burn. It went away in a few days with Butt Paste. While the cool alert is a novel idea, in practice it poses a health concern. We're sticking with the regular Pull-Ups from now on. If your child has had any adverse reaction, it's a good idea to comment."
3,Allergy Prone Beware,"I used these for my daughter when we started to potty train her. She kept getting diaper rash and she got a rash on her belly and inner thighs. When I took her to the doc, her doc said to change brands of pull ups. We switched to Seventh Generation and have had to signs of rash or allergy since. I did use Huggies in the past for other children and I liked them. But if you child is allergy prone or has sensitive skin then I strongly urge you to try a more natural product"
5,Great Diapers for a toddler,I love these for my toddler. I hate having to use regular diapers when we are working on using the bathroom like a big girl. These are much easier to use than old fashion diapers.
3,Okay but Easy Ups are better,"These are not the greatest. Because of the fact that they have velcro-type tabs on each side, they may as well be regular diapers. My daughter wants to put them on/take them off that way, rather than ""pulling up"" like training pants. A lot of day care centers prefer these because it's easier to change the child without taking their pants off, but I think they defeat the point. I've put my daughter to bed in these twice and they've leaked overnight both times. We've switched to the Pampers version now and we don't have the problem. I definitely prefer easy ups."
2,Better than the Eheim Ecco but...,"Pro's:-Quiet-Self priming (after the hose is initially filled)-Good flow rate-No leaks, no mess when removing hose blockCon's:-Flimsy (I'm returning it before it breaks)-Prime pump is very stiff doesn't work well (didn't need to use it though)-To complicated/to many seals--every basket has a seal that needs to be in placeI've had the fluval 304 and the Eheim Ecco. After fixing the Eheim for the 3rd time I decided to give up on that piece of junk and get something more durable. I looked at the new fluval and didn't like the design so I bought this filter and used it for a week but will be returning it due to the cons discussed above. I looked at the Rena and this seems like the best design (more durable, simpler design, fewer parts) so I'll try that one next. It also has better reviews though I am concerned with the leakage comments.From what I know I would rank filters in the following order1. Rena2. Marineland3. Fluval4. Eheim"
4,Worth sending to friends,"As a big Trillin fan and a connaisseur of doggerel, this is the best of both worlds, although to totally enjoy it, you need to be very attentive to US domestic politics, which is hard if you live overseas. Nevertheless, this book is a gem and worth sending to anyone."
5,Beautiful Mugs,These mugs match my dinner ware and I love them they are lightweight and thin. Hate heavy mugs. I feel like I'm using fine china instead of mug and yet I get a larger cup of coffee then a cup would give. Coffee up in morning and then my computer. What a great life.Pat
3,Decent,"The show was good until it hit the second season. Sam magically disappeared, so is Lou. They replaced Kenny with a better looking actor and they replaced the kid too. I hate it when they do that!"
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this in hopes to buy the whole series after, but I could barely get 5 whole minutes without it skipping, so I wasn't able to see much,very disappointed"
4,convenient,"my pro research need it to proceed smoothly. the internet bookstore is very convenient for me especially in foreign. this is important. if I need another book next time or someone want to buy other book, i do recommend Amazon."
1,don't buy it!,"I ordered the Revlon cordless curling iron and was so excited when it arrived. I'm going to Beijing in July and thought this curling iron would be perfect. I guess it would be if it worked! Luckily, I found out it didn't even charge before going and still have time to buy something else. What a rip off!Bev. Lyvers"
2,Not the case for istDS,This must be the first case for the ist D not the DS.The tether attatchment to the body of the cameras tripod socket will not fit.Other than that the case is well made.There must be a new case on the way.
5,Amway replacement part,"It did not fit. Otherwise, it was fine. In future,it would help if both the inner and outer diameter of such an object would be included in the description."
4,Memoirs review,The book was in good to excellent condition when I received it . It is a very sad and convoluted story even for a memoir it must have been difficult to make a movie out of it . I did not like the movie as well as the book .
3,Not as Great as I had hoped!,"This book started off with intrigue, but left me feeling as though I had missed something in the end. Being on a bit of a Non-fiction kick, I chose this book after Amazon said I would enjoy it! It was too far out there and jumped around way too much. I kept waiting for something to happen, and was left with nothing but a dysfunctional relationship in the end!"
1,The blurb doesn't live up to the contents,"The assertion a life worth writing about by an individual who can write well proves to be simply that, an assertion. Flynn's talents (?) are mediocre, the book tiresome, repetitive and unfortunately like most of the other 'my childhood was the pits' by which I mean it may self serve the author.None of the characters were likeable despite being deeply flawed (which often makes the person likeable).I doubt Flynn's daddy was worth writing about.It's done now.Do yourself a favour. Spend your money on a more worthy book - that's just about any other book so the choice is massive.As for Flynn being a poet, that is still open for debate. If his prose is at all similar to his poetics, his poetry would suck."
4,Good memoir,"Good, effective memoir/story of the author's father's struggle with homelessness and alcohol and drug use. Very well-written and compelling. A good read."
4,"Good pjs, good night!","Hanes Pajamas for Men Navy 55% Cotton/45% PolyesterAfter sleeping in pants that are too long and sleeves that cover my fingers, I am delighted to sleep like a babe in my new Hanes Pajamas which actually fit. No more tripping over pant legs and super long sleeves. Thank you, Hanes."
3,Must Be Me,"""In The Company Of Angels"", seems to have captured the feeling of others who have written about the book. N.M. Kelby certainly has written a charming short story but I fail to see what the fuss is about.The locale she sets her story in is charming, and the metaphors she creates from the town's product are for the most part well done. But there was nothing in this tale that has not appeared in a variety of other forms, and has not taken place during this ever-popular time period.I appear to be in the minority here, but I found the story too familiar, and at times a bit too precious"
2,What a waste,"In my honest opinion, this is a piece of junk. Its ok to get pictures uploaded to your computer but I have hooked this up to 3 different t.v.s and it wont work on a single one of them. I would rather just hook the camera directly to the computer threw the USB port."
4,Status only.,"Actually a very nice and well made carrying case, with the ""Nikon"" name on it.Case does hold camera and enough room for extra battery and CF card. However, if you need a little more space for filters, and ""stuff"" this is not the camera case for you. There are many good and well design cases out there that do a much better job and are cheaper to boot."
5,Nikon Case for CP8800,"Case is just right for day trips that dont require a whole lot except the camera, a couple of batteries and some media.Well made from soft, supple leather.Glad I bought it!"
5,"Similar to the Recording ""My Memories of You""","This is one of her better recordings. She is backed by some of the great names of jazz including Charlie Shavers, Buster Bailey, and Dick Hyman to name a few. This recording is similar to the ""My Memories of You"" which has two extra tracks on it. Either way it is a great recording showcasing her terrific voice. She is one of the few singers who was able to maintain her voice during her lengthy career. If you have not heard her Swedish recordings done in the 70's you should hear them, fantastic. They are also available here on amazon under the name of ""Queen."""
4,Satisfying Summer Read,"A very enjoyable read, this story follows the fortunes of four women over the course of a summer: Brigid, a naval wife who lets a few select summer guest cottages on her rural property, her mother, Frummie, half-sister Jemima, and cottage guest, Louise.Ms. Willet artfully develops their characters, such that you grow to care about each of them increasingly as the story unfolds.The only reason for four stars rather than five, is that I found the character of Martin rather unbelievable. His actions move the plot along nicely, but I find it hard to accept that anyone would actually behave that way!But this is a minor quibble, and the story remains thoroughly entertaining."
3,summer in the country,"I agree with one of your reviewers that this book was not as well written as her earlier. Too many of the characters are always having their guts clutching with terror, fear or other over the top sensations. A little less of these over the top feelings would be much better. Also more descriptions of the countryside, cooking, hominess in general would be great."
4,Pink Panther towel,"The towel is really bright and colorful. It is also very large, bigger than a bath towel, more in the beach towel range, so that part is true.It is not very thick at all, as it is more decorative than functional, but that is not to say it is flimsy. I consider it a great add to my Pink Panther collection, and people have told me to hang it on the wall like a tapestry."
4,An easy and enthusiastic read,"Legendary F1 commentator Murray Walker teams up with F1 journalist Simon Taylor to compile this updated version of the book that celebrates Murray's unbridled passion for Formula One.In Formula One Heroes, Walker celebrates his most favourites F1 drivers of all time, providing great little snapshots of the likes of Fangio, Moss, Hunt, Andretti, Lauda, Prost, Senna and Mansell.The presentation is nicely tailored, with general career stats for each and a couple of quick bullet points outlining why they make Walker's shortlist, before we get to the more detailed analysis of each character.Despite having left the commentary box some years before penning this updated version with Taylor, Walker's passion for F1 is still very raw and tangible, and this is an easy and enthusiastic read from one of F1's most-loved personalities."
2,bettr buy a new computer,"While new computers are getting more powerful at the same time they are getting cheaper, the SATA hard drive of less than 500 GBytes duplicated their prices from August of this year to date. It is irrelevant the technical specification of these hard disks , or how good they might be: it is absurd and very irritating their escalating prices. I am going to buy a new computer"
2,Got Old Fast,"I bought this book before going leaving for London on a 6 month work and travel visa. After the first couple days in London I stopped taking the book out with me because it wasn't helpful at all. The background history of England was fine, but the guide didn't help me find any good (affordable) restaurants, and it had a poor selection of the sites London has to experience. And the directions to those I wanted to see were unclear, so I couldn't find them.The Time Out guide is a much better guide. Time Out is actually a London magazine that lists all the goings on in London. The guide is a collection of quirky shops and good restaurants and off-beat sites plus in includes the traditional must-see sites."

5,Strong and sized accordingly.,"These are exactly as pictured. I noticed that some reviews said that the company sent a cheaper product that was not described. But I did get exactly what is pictured. They are the strong keychain type, and they are 5/8""diameter, exactly the same measurement as stated in the description. There appear to be 100 count."
1,Horrible story,"I love kenshin but this whole son of God story REEKED. The fighting scenes where lame. The story revolved more around Sano than Kenshin. The rest of the characters were just fillers. In the end, I agree that this one is not even worth renting. This was even worse than some of those comical fillers in the previous DVDs. Buy it only if you are collector."
3,DVD Was In Great Shape!,"I have no problems with the price or the time of arrival for my DVD. It was very reasonable. But for some reason, there is a few seconds of black out in the movie during the scene where one of the three evils is at a brothel throwing gold at the prostitutes. This didn't stop me from keeping the disc because it's the movie editor's fault, but this is a little something I thought a fan of the movie should know about. Other than this, I love this DVD!"
4,Interwoven lives of Nobel Prize Winners,"Today's science and medicine research in fiction. Having met researchers involved in the miscarriage and pregancy research, I found the book fascinating and I continue to want to know how the characters lives were transformed by the Prize. Sequel, please?I was so mesmerized that I took the book to a baseball game and finished it as the Angels beat the Orioles!"
5,Another Awesome Dragon Tale Adventure!,"The girls love this book as much as the video, and they have taken an interest in constellations after this tale. I like how it tackles the problem of being afraid of the dark, and again the characters work together to solve a problem. My girls loved this tale so much that I had to make stars for them to put in their rooms! lol"
2,Neither fish nor fowl,"This book has been at the bottom of my heap since I bought it. It is too long and poorly organized to be a valuable introduction to the C++ language. But it is not a guide to good use of C++ (a la _Effective C++_ or _C++ Strategies and Tactics_), because most of what it presents is bare exposition of language features.On the plus side, it is fairly thorough, with coverage of templates, STL and namespaces."
3,In love with it minus a few problems,"We absolutely love this cage for our three ferrets. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because when ours arrived the top door latch was broken off. It was easy enough for us to use cable ties to solve this problem vs. returning it or exchanging parts. Secondly, the instructions weren't the easiest to read/follow/understand for our teenage son who put it together before us. This gave him some frustration since he was determined to do it himself.The things I love most about it are the sturdiness of the cage, that it doesn't have that white coating over the metal, the storage shelves, the wheels, the ease of cleaning it and the fact that so far none of them have been able to get out :D"
3,Not very safe...,"Well, I thought I was upgrading my cage, and the design is nice, but I had to make some major changes to it to make it safer.1. all the stairs are to steep, but the stairs midway up are very unsafe because if the ferret slips off to the side, there is a potential for the ferret to fall to the bottom, causing even a strong ferret to break a leg or a paw. I would have designed the stairs to be against the cage, which I thought that's what they were. I ended up taking the midway stairs out and using the extra sliding door to block the top off until I figure out how to make the stairs safer.2. the bottom of the cage is very inconvenient to clean because the ferret poo will get on the cage wires at the bottom. I guess I could let it dry a bit and then scrape it off into the tray, then dispose of it...Overall, it's a nice design but delicate creatures like ferrets have a hard time climbing around without falling. Beware."
2,Incorrect part (C3),"Overall the quality of the cage is very nice.However, the 2nd floor piece that I received (C3) is incorrect.The opening is in the middle of the part instead of offset to the side, so the ramp does not line up from the platform below.In addition, the plastic tray was badly broken on one of the edges.After contacting Amazon, I received another shipment with the exact same problem.I tried calling and emailing the manufacturer and did not receive ANY response."
3,low quality,"This was a prime item when i purchased it and was soon removed after because of my experience. Here are some pros and cons.Pros:Nice layout and great size for the price.Easy to cleanEasy to move to clean aroundTwo doors for more convience.Cons:The way they packaged this breaks the bottom plastic shelf. This was a common complaint and the reason Amazon pulled this item as a prime item.The powder coat doesn't hold up well to urine and it started peeling after little useThe places the screws attracted to were very weak metal and stripped easily because of poor craftsmanship.Weak weldsOverall i didn't return this item because it was already put together and didn't notice most of the cons until it was already put together. The instructions were HORRIBKE also. How hard is is to make user friendly instructions? Amazon was great and offered me 20% back for my troubles, kudos to them!"
5,Works,"Bought 2 of these because my original was starting to act up. (also bought a stand alone charger) Whereas my standard one could make maybe 1-15 minute call before beeping relentlessly ""low battery"" These however last for several 30 min - 1 1/2 hour calls before even losing 1 bar on the battery indicator. I would deffinately reccomend them."
1,Very Useful Reference,"I bought this book as a quick reference for a Technical Support group I manage. We have a few dozen products that require an installer to run wires throughout a house. Unfortunately, a large majority of the calls I get are wiring related and this book provides tremendous insight into the problems created by improper wiring.If you want to learn about wiring, this is the book to buy. I also bought the full book that goes with it. It must be good because I got the only paperback, and all the used hardback books are almost double the retail price.From this guide you'll learn everything relating to wiring. You'll learn balanced vs unbalanced, ground loop isolation vs cross talk, and the list would almost be half as long as the pocket guide. Simply put, if your livlihood depends upon wiring, this book will help you a great deal."
2,Not for the novis.,I purchased this product with a novis knowledge of electronics. I could not understand one page. If you are a novis this is not the book for you.
2,Baby bottle nipples,"Tried to use these with my 12 month old. The milk comes out really fast. Milk just ran down his face. Probably works good for a baby who is use to a bottle. He was bf until 12 months getting a limited amount of bottles. I will just stick with the small opening nipples, but wish these would have worked to spend up the bottle feeding time at night."
5,My one year old's favorite toy!!,Even though the toy is recommended for 2-5 years of age we decided to purchase this toy for our one year old's birthday. I have been taking him to the park and he has shown a growing interest in the slides. We figured he would grow into it but WOW! The minute my husband got it up he was climbing all over it and got right up the step ladder with no problems! He absolutely lowes it!! He goes down the slide and climbs right back up. The toy is very sturdy (I was able to climb onto the platform and I am currently 140 lbs.) which was one of my concerns when buying a slide for our son. The assembly on the toy was so easy! It took about 10 mins and only required 4 screws to secure it. You can't go wrong with this toy. My husband loved the fact it was so easy to put together and my son loves the slide and climbing into it and under it. Your child will get years of enjoyment. Highly recommended!!
2,Only some stickers stick..,"Only some some of the stickers stick. They are hard to get off the sheets and there are only 4 pages to stick them on. The pages display the scene, yet the scene is done so badly that the suggested stickers for the page fit no where. These stickers are supposed to peel and stick over and over, well they done. They shred, tear, crinkle, bubble - all on the first try. They are very fragile and tricky. Even I couldn't do it!"
2,Treats many topics superficially,"When I bought this book I was hoping to get a thorough and deep treatment of theological issues. I was disappointed by the brief manner most topics were dealt with. What I find is the author presenting various views represented by the most prominent schools of thought and then giving an short evaluation of them. There is no real systematic development of any theory given here, no thorough exegesis of scriptural passages, no profound insights. Read a few chapters of Jonathan Edwards works and you will see the difference."
3,Good beginnings,The book really pushes one to think about and explore their beliefs. It gives one a better picture of what they really believe and what they are on the fence about.
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this toy when it was on sale for my almost two year old. Well, when it received it, I was so disappointed because it seemed that the only thing the toy did was make noises and flash lights. I don't see how a child could be interested in it for more than 10 minutes. The toy looks better on the picture than it does in real life, and it is pretty cheaply made."
1,Scary,If you are looking to scare your clients from never drinking this video will do just that and incite some PTSD !
3,"Be aware of what you are getting -- not your traditional ""La Folia""","This CD seems to be a re-release. The original release is reviewed elsewhere on Amazon; make sure to read those reviews as well. I didn't, and was surprised at what I heard when I listened to it. It is ""La Folia"" done tongue-in-cheek; odd instruments and sound effects, people making noises or talking, gunshots, cars, etc. Not a clue to its true nature can be found without listening to it. One reviewer likened it to PDQ Bach. PDQ Bach is entertaining; this CD is not... well, maybe if you also like Andy Kaufman. I gave this 3 stars only because of the ensemble's virtuosity, and also remembering how great their CD ""La Spagna"" was.If you're looking for good ""La Folia"" interpretations, I would recommend ""Teatro Lirico"" by Stephen Stubbs, or ""La Folia 1490-1701"" by Jordi Savall et al."
4,Sharp and precise cutting,"This knife is my go- to knife in the kitchen!! It has stayed super sharp. However, the blade has several chips in it from use."
5,Wonderful and fabulous cookbook!,This cookbook is wonderful. I have tried over half of the recipes and my family loves them. I like cooking with this book as the recipes are simple and the dishes are truly flavorful. I highly recommend this cookbook to anyone!
5,Hot 'n Sweet.....,"My absolute favorite salad dressing. Has some kick and also some sweet......perfect for greens, blue cheese, walnuts and fruit or just basic green salad. Once you try it you will be a fan."
1,Loud Humming Noise,I like the wind noise from a fan. I don't like fans with motors that make more noise than the fan blades. If you don't like whining noises don't buy this fan. And the low speed is almost the same as the fast speed.
2,Super loud fan.,This fan is TOO LOUD. I could not use it at work because all of my neighbors said it was way too loud. Sounds like a jet engine.
2,Loud and Ineffective,"I really don't like this fan. It's noisy and doesn't move much air. Another thing I HATE about it is that you can't remove the grills to clean it. This fan turned me against Holmes fans. I bought 2 Lasko fans that are a much better design, perform better, and are a better value. I would not recommend this product."
5,"Very Loud, Not Too Cold","So perfect for our boys' room. Our youngest (2) is a very light sleeper, and his older brother (4) who talks in his sleep was always waking him up. This fan provides fantastic, loud white noise without freezing them both out at night. We have another baby due in Dec and I know the boys will be able to sleepn soundly across the hall no matter how many times she wakes up in the middle of the night crying. Such a great purchase! We couldn't be happier."
3,Noisy as a chainsaw...,I bought this fan to use in the bedroom but it is just too noisy. It doesn't seem to move air better than any other fan.
1,"""BLIZZARD"" is a misnomer.","The name, ""Blizzard,"" is not a reflection on the effects of this fan--just a marketing gimmick. It moves a disappointingly small mass of air yet makes a surprising amount of noise. As one other person said, it can be mounted on a wall. I was going to place it on a shelf and point it downward at my bed. I was not able to do this because it only tilts upward to blow up. It will not tilt downward to blow down. I find that I have little use for this fan. What's good about it? It looks nice, I suppose. And the sound it makes, although relatively loud, is sort of a satisfying sound. It sounds like its moving a lot of air but it's not."
5,They go right in her mouth,"Very safe and cute toy for baby. No paint comes off, not parts break off. Very soft for my one year old to chew on."
2,too soft,"This mattress is simply not very firm. It comes rolled up! While the company claims they have a special process that does this, and the mattress will unfold and never again be able to roll up again (true), I notice none of the more expensive mattresses come rolled up.I wanted a firm or extra firm mattress, and this simply has too much sag. For about $50 more, you can get a Simmons Torrey's Peak Extra Firm. While that one certainly is cheap for a Simmons (and likewise the extra firm feels more like firm) it's better and more supportive than this one.We have ours on the lower bunk in the guest room, and it will do. Note it's shallow enough to work for a top bunk, too, which is a plus. The Simmons one also fits for that, too, though."
4,Average Charge,BE sure to purchase the actual EN-EL7 from Nikon. Most others do not last as 3/4 as long.
2,Not for small group study,Gave it a shot and read the entire book with our small group. Questions are elementary and don't always related to the passage read. Struggle to spark good discussion time so we made up our own questions instead. May be better for beginners.
2,My first Sony....,"Bought it last week, received it on Thursday not working by Monday, what a shame, it's my first VIAO, the notebook doesn't boot up, looks like the HD is defective, called customer service at Sony, very rude guy, conclusion: after spending almost 2 thousands in this machine and finding it defective I'm returning it right away"
3,"Fantastic, except for keyboard","So far I love this notebook. The only problem I'm noticing is that the right side of the keyboard (beyond letters H,Y,N) sinks into the laptop when I'm typing, as if there is not enough support under these keys, but more air. I wonder if it's because the DVD player is on that side? The left side of the keyboard feels studier. Does anyone else notice this problem? Can Sony fix it?"
4,A bit confusing at the beginning,"The book starts out flipping back and forth between 1st and 3rd person. It almost feels like 2 separate writers. One started it and the 2nd finished it. That issue gets resolved, and is a excellent read. I love it."
1,Best book in a long time,"I love this book...bought it on my Kindle, read it..and ordered a paperback for my grandaughter..I have already reviewed this book with you guys..why do I have to do it again?"
4,Sad Emotional Story,This was a book I will not forget. It was depressing and at the same time inspirational. When they were finally free I was sobbing and upset that it had ended without telling how she got to America - and It did. Such a sad time in history. It must never repeat.
4,Fascinating read,What an amazing woman. Her personal memories of this horrific experience make fascinating reading. Very thought provoking but surprisingly positive.
4,Our Husband,"Cute book. Easy read. Good for the beach!! If you are looking for a fun book, this one's for you!"
4,Another Fun Book to read!,"This was just a really light hearted book about one husband, his three wives and how his untimely death brought them all together. It makes you mad sometimes and you're laughing the next. I enjoyed the quick read and fun filled pages."
4,Our Husband,This book was entertaining and I enjoyed reading it. I could sympathize with each of the characters and see each certainly had motive.
4,Pretty good read,Kind of slow start but all of a sudden you are hooked and wondering what will happen next. I loved the variety of characters & picking out whiched acted like you would. Some of end you saw coming but other things you did not. Pretty fast read!
3,nice read,"It is easy reading and has amusing, genial characters. I finished the book, which I don't do if I don't like it."
3,an interesting storyline,an interesting read that incorporates many lives affected by a cheating husband and incest. Not my usual read but was interesting all the same
4,3.5 Stars,"This was a very entertaining book. No three more disparate women could have been found and yet they managed to bond over the fact that each was accused of murdering the same man, their current husband. The question for the reader is not so much who killed him, but how did he manage to stay alive as long as he did? As each woman faced the rank deception by the man they loved, each had to adjust her thinking and her approach to life. The rug is pulled out from under and they are each dealing with a different set of big problems. Their road to discovery of self and solutions is told from the three points of view. One understands and sympathizes with each all the while laughing at these ducks that have been catapulted out of their waters. There were errors and the police were made out to be complete dolts, but this is not a book meant to be taken seriously and the errors were of the ""so what"" variety. If you can avoid picking nits, this book is a quick read and very satisfying."
3,GOOD READ FUNNY,TO THINK THAT THIS REALLY HAPPENS. NEW TWIST ON LIVING 3 DIFFERENT LIVES. HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? THESE WOMEN ALL SHARE SOMETHING IN COMMON. WHAT A SICK TWISTED HUSBAND THIS GUY WAS.
4,Interesting,"Found this to be interesting and unexpected. Ending was a little predictable but over all the book was good. Would recommend as a ""light"" read."
4,NOT A BAD READ!,"I really enjoyed this book! I was surprised!! It is a little far fetched, however the Author incorporates the characters so well, you really start becoming a part of the story and the plot. All three main characters become endearing, and each is SO different, they actually compliment one another...three woman in one, hhhmmmm- Is that was he was looking for? This is an 'EASY' read, and may leave you with-- justice has been served!"
4,You never know in life!,Kept me reading to the end with a smile and interest. Really liked the characters once again. Would recommend it to anyone wanting a laugh and little mystery.
4,good read,"good book, it was a fun and easy read. Enjoyable book, I loved each of the characters in their own way. The end through me for a loop"
5,Enjoyable,It was a good story and the characters seemed believable. I enjoyed the plot and I was surprised by the turn of events. I'm looking forward to reading other stories by this auther.
3,Our Husband,"I didn't have any trouble reading the book, but it was far from the best book I've read. It was a cute, easy read, entertaining without substance!"
2,I just didn't laugh!,"Okay, I am a huge fan of Stephanie Bond. But this book just didn't make me laugh and at times it was so pathetic I wanted to cry. If you have a lot of empathy this book can make you angry and hurt for these poor women! But laugh.... sadly I wanted to laugh but nothing was humorous. I did appreciate the end, but I am not sure if it was because it was a good ending or that it was finally over! But would I read another Stephanie Bond book... YES! Normally I can't put her books down. Hopefully a little more giggle will be in the next one! :)"
3,Light and whitty,This was a nice easy read that I could pick up and set down at any time. Worth a read
1,Not that accurate,Interesting story line and the need to know what happens next is what makes you want to continue reading. The initial description said that was a funny story but I didn't find any part of it to be light hearted or funny.
4,Our Husband,This book was humourous and almost too stupid to believe. I persevered to the end but probably could have read something else instead.
1,Irony is not ironic,"irony: the expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humours or emphatic effect.There are a few unforgivible mistakes in the literary world. Misunderstanding irony is one of them. If you write a book, a post, a song, a blurb, or speak about irony, it sounds stupid to people like me when you got your definition of irony from a song from the 90's.Stephanie Bond LOVES to say things are ironic, she has her characters smiling at the irony, reflecting on the irony, marveling at the irony and almost choking on the irony... yet NONE of the situations involved are actually ironic. None. How does a writer, an editor, and a publisher not understand a high school vocabulary word and how to apply it when writing a novel is beyond me.This is otherwise an entertaining book about a man who dies and leaves his three wives to deal with the fallout. It's not particularly groundbreaking or a new story, but it was not a rip-off at $0.99."
3,Good beach day/plane ride read,"Quick read, differnt type than what I usually read. Characters interesting, especially how they interact with each other.Liked how the story played out"
4,Wonderful,Wonderful book. I Totally enjoyed it. I laughed a lot and was interested in what was happening all throughout the book.
4,our husband,Very well written .Held my interest and had a little twist to the ending. Would read other books by this author.
3,Nice not challenging,"This is a nice enough read and an interesting story but the couple of twists are a bit clunky and not quite earned. That said if you are looking for a no brainier, pleasant read this is for you."
3,Our Husband,Good quick read. Interesting plot and story. Reccomend to anyone for airplane reading. Can stop and pick-up easily. Not real humoruus but funny.
3,Our Husband,Quite predictable but on the whole an easy read. One of those books that is easy to pick up and put down
3,Our Husband,"I really liked the plot twist that affected three women who had completly different life styles.The unlikly.but not unheard of,multiable wives of one man always creats different and sometimes funny events.I am not surprised that all three wives were looked opon as suspects as the saying goes,beware a woman scorned.The ending was done well and answered most questions."
5,A Great Read!,"I only have one criticism about this whodunit and that is Stephanie Bond hasn't written a sequel ... I didn't want the book to end, it left me wanting to read more! The three main characters are absolutely delightful, quirky, their interrelationship honest, the situations they often found themselves in were amusing, sometimes downright hilarious. PLEASE STEPHANIE BOND, BRING BACK BEATRIX, NATALIE, & RUBY!"
3,Lovelace,"Sometimes funny, a little romantic, and an almost predictable end. Characters were easy to understand and follow. A light bedtime read."
1,Too complicated!,"I started reading the book and was just unable to continue. I thoroughly enjoy reading Regency Romances but this one wasn't to my liking.I felt that there were unnecessary obstacles. In addition, it feels like there were just way too many jumbles in the plot line. Too many misunderstandings. Too many misconceptions. All of which can be solved simply and yet instead more misunderstandings occur to make the story overly complicated.I think if you like reading about the main character acting as a 15 year old in a school for young ladies and about possible spies for Napolean and a lot of confusion and misunderstandings between characters you may enjoy this book.I also found it hard to remember the romance portion of the book. The characters spent too much time misunderstanding the other that the relationship development wasn't that smooth."
1,Nothing memorable here,"I LOVE to read. This book is an exception to that thought. It was very predictable (I knew the ""bad guy"" from the first introduction of him (or her)? Very little interesting dialogue. I spent only $.99 for this book and feel like I overpaid."
1,Awful,"I feel like I've been reading a different book. MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! The H & H are shallow characters and when the author tries to give them depth she fails miserably.The leads constantly jump to the wrong conclusions about each other (especially the heroine) and then out of the blue they are in love( when 5 pages before the hero is proposing marriage to a lady who, to his knowledge, has shared a grand total of 10 minutes with him). The mystery makes no sense and the whole books feels like the ""filler scenes"" in good romances. I would wait for this author to mature."
2,Not what we wanted,"I should say that I did not try this phone with skype, but there were several disappointments with it as a regular phone.1.) It uses AAA batteries and does not come with, or appear to have any option for a transformer (wall wart), so you have to watch the batteries and replace them. No batteries are included. Maybe using it USB provides phantom power? If so, what happens when you turn your computer off?2.) The speaker-phone cuts off the first word of everything you say, making it unusable.3.) The display is hard to read at some angles.Everything else about it seems great, but we are returning it for the above reasons."
4,Good for the price,"It's good for the price and I always thought it worked very well. However, upon trying a more expensive iron of my friend's (Chi 1""), I realized that you get what you pay for. Although it works, it does not straighten as well as some other irons. You will have to spend more time on your hair, especially if your hair's naturally wavy like mine.If you want something faster and that will leave your hair silkier, invest a little more."
5,"Great straightener, great price!","I was a little wary of getting my first hair straightener because I kept hearing about all the bad ones! I didn't want to get an expensive one since I wasn't sure how much I'd use it and the cheaper ones seemed to break or burn hair. This one was perfect for me: ceramic, reasonably priced, and lots of heat adjustment. It's only been a month, but so far it's working great. Now I can put my thick wavy hair into some measure of control and elegance. It's starting to take a little longer to heat up now than in the beginning, and I hope it isn't a sign of breaking, but of being broken in."
1,Worked for a while...,"This straightner does work nicely, however, much like the other review I read my straightner also decided to never heat up after I only used to 4 times. There must be some kind of problem with the manufacturing of this straightner. Don't buy it unless you want to use it a few times and then need to buy a new one."
4,good for the price,"it's hard to see what tempature it's set at. It heats up very fast, and is pretty durable (i've been traveling with it for 8 months now)"
4,Good Charlotte- Live from Brixton Academy,This a great DVD if you like the band. They play on an awesome stage and everyone is REALLY into it. I really suggest Buying the DVD
2,NOT a solar fountain,"While this item is lovely in appearance, the marketing is deceiving, indicating it has a solar feature: ""Smart Solar Sandstone pillar with globe"" It should read ""Electric powered Sandstone-like resin pillar with globe"" It does not have a solar feature. I would not have purchased it w/o a solar pump. I should have read more carefully but am accustomed to Amazon's customary honest marketing. Buyer beware."
4,A great present for a one year old,My son received this toy for his first birthday. He absolutely loves it. He takes all the animals out and then puts them back in over and over again. He also loves rolling it around on the floor. He plays with it for long periods of time. His 2 1/2 and fixing to be 4 year old siblings also enjoy playing with it as well.
5,VERY CUTE TOY!,My daughter received this for her 2 yr B-day. What a wonderful toy!! We are already fans of little people and were thrilled to see they had Noah's Ark! The boat rocks up and down when pushed forward....it opens up for more play....and the animals store inside and everything stays together.She also received both packs of extra animals and even with the additional animals there is enough room to put all the animals inside the ark to close and put away!Highly recommend this toy!!
5,Cute & Durable,"We registered for this set when I was expecting and were so glad to have it to pull out of the closet when our daughter was about 9 months old. She's coming up on her second birthday and we're still so pleased with this toy. The animals are very cute - they come in pairs of course, but the female animals have a little pink blush on their cheeks and sometimes some other distinguishing characteristic to set them apart from the males. We have fun lining the animals up two by two and seeing how far across the room the line stretches. (We also have the 2 supplemental animal sets.) The Ark has fun details on/in it like a check list of the animals and a photo of Noah and his wife. The different configurations for the ark make it a more versatile toy. It also can store all of the pieces in one place. The whole set is very durable as proven by my daughter's occasional rough handling of it. Definitely recommended!"
1,No go go for the Moto,"I purchased this battery because the battery that came with my new phone would barely last 3 hours. This battery was supposed to be ""more powerful"" - however, beware of the fact that they do not state the talk time in the info anywhere online. The guys at the phone store couldn't even tell me. It is much thicker and heavier. I was not impressed. So I am returning it and the RAZR Moto phone. Why would they make a phone you can't use a head set and charge at the same time??!! Oy!"
4,Hard to find video. Worked well.,My autistic son loves videos. He was thrilled to get this. We received it in plenty of time for xmas.
4,Civil War Battles,"I bought this DVD set because I had read that it contained a review of the reasons for the Civil War. I was not disappointed. This set contains three DVDs. Particuarly the first of those has a good analysis of the reasons for the Civil War, but the others also have a good input. The set contains an analysis of each battle of the Civil War, and although I have many DVDs accounting for the many battles, none have it wrapped up totally the way this set does. I would recommend this DVD set to anyone interested in the reasons behind the Civil War and an analysis of every battle that took place."
4,Christmas gift...,"This is a Christmas gift for my son, I don't know anything about the game yet. I'm sure it works fine and it arrived just as the seller said it would!"
2,might work for some,"this product might work do some, however it had no effect on the neighbors insanely barking Doberman.personally.I think the do is just mental.."
1,Not made to last more than a few weeks!!!,"When the product works, it's effective and the teaches the neighbors dogs not to bark. The problem is that this is the 2nd one I've owned and they have both stopped working after a very short amount of time. The first unit had a bad display after a month and without it you couldn't program when it comes on and shuts off. The second unit starts buzzing from the second I install the batteries so it's virtual useless to train the neighbors dogs since it's buzzing all the time. I think if the technology was made better, this would be a great product, but since it's not, it's a waste of money.I would not purchase this product again."
2,Great device!,"After set up, this thing works great. I had problems with neighbors dogs yapping all night. Not anymore! I mounted on a 2nd story banister and aimed it at where the dogs normally hang out. We sleep real well now. Well, three months after installation, the digital display stopped working, so I cannot reset it (cannot use at all). I am waiting for the seller to tell me what needs to be done. I would have to change the rating I gave this product to 2-1/2 stars now. It may go below that if there is no easy resolution."
4,So far so good....,"I have been using the product for about 3 or 4 days, installed above the fenceline (6 ft. high) by about 2 feet, which gives it an unobstructed viewpoint to my neighbors barking daschunds, and only about 2 ft. in from the fenceline. So far I am more than pleasantly surprised at how this has really reduced my neighbors 2 dogs's annoyance barking. They still bark from time to time, when provoked, my dog being outside against the fence or me being out in the backyard. But as far as them barking for hours straight for no apparent reason, the results have been great at stopping that."
2,works great but you may go to jail,"this product worked great fot 2 years. Ah peace. But then it malfunctioned and was constantly emitting a horrible audible sound to humans. We were out as soon as we got back we turned it off. We were too late. The neighbors had caled the police and now we are facing criminal charges, for disturbing the peace. Heavy fines and a week in the poke.Thanks bark free"
4,Different then previous DVDs but still a good buy,My toddler is a Wiggles fanatic. He has a collection of 22 DVDs. I knew from the description this one was going to be different. With Sam replacing Greg I knew there weren't going to be the same songs that my son loves but new ones for him to fall in love with. He got excited over the different costumes as Wiggles became nursery rhyme characters. This Wiggles DVD is a great combination of Wiggles energy & old classics. Defenitely one to add to your collection.
5,Fun music,Lots of positive fun for the little ones.... my grand daughters love the music and lots of positive nuturing information.
3,Be advised...it's all music not much else.,"My 3 year old loves the Wiggles and usually watches their DVDs all the way til conclusion. Although this offering is not like the others (has no story, just songs) he does like certain songs and plays it in the car on short trips."
3,disappointing,"i'm a huge fan of her books! i mean, i have read every one i could get my hands on! but this was such a disappointment. it wasn't comical or romantic at all, which are 2 of the best features of her other books! i'm so used to laughing at her characters and the bizarre situations they get into, but i didn't laugh once with this. i am hoping she will go and write something more worthwhile next time, like the countless other series' that she has out there."
1,What the f**k!,"This could have been an awsome book! But, instead, all that was published were unfinished ideas and bad writing. Characters seem to change age or names within a few pages (without time passing, motivations aren't clear, I could go on. I agree that some editing would have helped, but the writing gave the impression that the author didn't really care. Just handed over notes or something. I threw the book away after reading it. If the author and publisher don't care, why should we?"
5,Yankees Lamp,A co-worker and I bought this lamp for our boss to use in his office. He is a huge Yankees fan and was in desparate need of a new lamp for his desk. The lamp is absolutely gorgeous - especially with a bulb in it. I would buy it again and would recommend it to friends.
5,"Classic, clean fragrance!","This has been one of my favorite perfumes for the last 10 years. It's so hard to find in stores, and Amazon usually has the best price. If you like clean, warm fragrances, you will like this (someone once commented that it smelled ""soapy, but in a good way"")."
2,irregular,"hello, I dont know what really happened with the perfumen but its aparience was not good it was open and it was not complete at all even though I got it"
1,Was Merrick a Woman-Hater?,"The depiction of women as controlling castrators in this book is offensive. The depiction of rape as a natural consequence of women's ""teasing"" behaviors in this book is offensive. The author's blatant misogyny turned me off from an otherwise interesting story. I expected more from a gay classic."
5,Off the chart good!!!,"I love,love love this product, it does work on your system and keep you reguarly in the bathroom....I love it but I can get it cheaper at the store."
5,using more than I ever thought I would,"I was going to just put this on my cereal in the morning. Now I add it to my protein shake suppliments and I've started cooking with it by using it as a breading for fish, chicken, or pretty much anything. It's fantastic! I'm going to end up ordering more soon."
2,not great,"having read most of the other Ed McBains, i found this book to be kind of trite. Yes, it does give you a puzzle. But I like The Daniel Silva-Gabriel Alon books better."
4,A remarkable woman,"I've had an interest in Inessa Armand for some time now, as I am fascinated by Soviet history. Overall, Pearson does an excellent job in telling her story based on researched historical fact. Inessa was a Bolshevik revolutionary in a time when women had no rights/education/etc., and stood out remarkably from other women of her time. She had an open marriage, several affairs (most famously her lasting affair with Lenin), a revolutionary career, and still managed to be a caring mother to her children. Also unusual was her lasting friendship with Lenin's wife, which is uncharacteristic of such relationships.However, I do have one criticism of this book. It's rather obvious that Pearson despises Lenin, which seems to hang over the second half of the book. He has a hard time focusing on Inessa after the revolution, but instead devotes more time to being critical of Lenin. This book isn't supposed to be his biography; it is supposed to be hers."
3,Wish I could give a better rating,"I love that this is one of the only food-based iron supplements out there, but this one didn't work out for us. I bought it for my 9-month-old, who is borderline anemic and refuses solid foods. While the flavor is pleasant to ME (sort of like apricots), it is too strong for his taste; I tried mixing it with water, expressed breast milk or some juice, but he would either spit it out or gag and throw up. You also need to give a lot of the product, compared to other brands; 5mL of Floradix versus 1mL of My Kidz Iron is a big difference when you are trying to force-feed it to an infant."
5,Freeman: A Fantstic Author,I am quite addicted to all of R. Austin Freeman mysteries.This is a tale about a box left in the Fenchurch Stationthat contains a human head. It is a very bizarre incidentthat only Dr. Thorndyke can solve. I am tryig to find every book Freeman wrote and dread getting to the last one as Idid with the one and only Conan Doyle. The best mysteries of all time I have found were written in the 1800's and early1900's. Brilliance never seen again.
1,Smells Bad and Food Taste Bad!!!!!,"We used this in our office and after about 6 months we noticed the microwave made a high pitch squeal and when you would open the door it kind of smelled like it was burning up-like melted plastic. It still works but now our food is starting to be tastless, except for a metalic and plastic taste. Cant be healthy! We are throwing it in the trash and getting a new GE! By the way this was bought in store not online."
2,"Looks great, but...","This microwave looks good and I love the stainless interior BUT the unit isn't very well made. It's loud when it runs, it's loud when you close the door, you have to push the buttons quite hard to operate it, and it beeps 5 times to signal when something is done! There are much better microwaves out there for the price. I've had it less than a week so let's see how it hold up."
1,Product Not Working,"I received this item 11/26/2011. I travel almost every week and am home only on weekends. This product will not heat up any of my food and has not worked for almost a month. It is obviously too late to return it to Amazon, so I had to contact the Cuisinart Customer Service. I have had it less than six months and now I have to pay to ship all 33.5 pounds to Arizona to have it repaired. Cuisinart products only have a limited warranty that does not cover shipping for damaged products. You will never know this before you buy the product, because it is only in the users manual in the inside. I now have to ship this off and buy a microwave to use temporarily. Not cost effective or convenient.Cuisinart CMW-100 1-Cubic-Foot Stainless Steel Microwave Oven"
1,purchased new Coby MP-C7052 at Amazon -- returned,"Ordered to download library digital books that are WMA. This product says it will receive WMA -- it would not. Library sends to Overdrive Media -- and only MP3 will go onto this player. Still looking for a Coby to replace one that is about 4 years old and ""faltering."""
1,"What happened to this cargo liner, it is too small",This cargo liner is so small that it is useless.I returned it ASAP. I immediately ordered another liner that covered the entire area from the second row seats to the hatch from a different manufacturer.
3,Great album from founding member of Velvet Underground,"Should be 4 stars""What ever happened to Maureen Tucker"" You ask yourself that every day. Well ask no longer. Maureen is alive and kicking and still creating music. ""Life in Exile After Abdication"" is a great solo record put out by Ms. Tucker and it is also alive and kicking. While it's not a continuation of the VU sound, it has a lo-fi crunchiness all its own.I've only heard it on a cassette at a time where I stored them on the floor of my bug sans case so the sound quality was pretty poor but it still had kick to it. Who knew Maureen had this kind of energy bottled up in her. Kind of a quasi punk meets blues minimalist (hey, I ain't no professional music critic hack). If you can find it, you won't be disappointed."
1,Talk about a cash grab,"Here's the deal folks. Opportunistic label president JT the Bigga Figga knowns Game has an album coming out right quick on Dr. Dre's Aftermath label, so he takes some demos that Game recorded back in the day and calls it The Untold Story. This sh--t happens all the time. The vocals are massively overdubbed to up the quality, but it doesn't cover up the fact this was not authorized by Game. JT the BIgga Figga talks all over the record about how HE discovered Game (rigfht down to the exact date!) and the photos on the inside are wack-ass - because he had no clearance to use anything other than the ones that he took on an Instamatic during shows two years ago. Althugh Game has some nice flow, he's a pale imitation of Shyne here and the beats are mediocre. Buy at your own risk. It's cash grab time, folks."
4,This album is just a taste of whats to come.,"The hip hop community is about to witness its next great rapper ""The Game"" along with another Dre episode with the combination of Aftermath/G-Unit/Shady records to lead the way in 2005.The Game is no joke this rapper has skills like no other on the westcoast. Don't be fooled by this album. This album was put out to let us know that JT The Bigga Figga discovered his talent.For a preview on whats to come in January check out the video clip of The Game and 50 performing ""West Side Story"" at MTVnews.com."
2,It's iight,"I thought that Untold Story was ok,but no where near the level The documentary is on. You gotta hand it to game though he been through some hard stuff even that bullet to the heart and he still going. His flow is crucial. He is definitely the best in G-unit. Keep it up Game."
4,"Easy read, great info.","Well written, easy to read and comprehend. Great for a student to begin development of a project."
1,Not really a backpack,"My wife and I bought this for our 2 year old son who absolutely loves Winnie the Pooh. What we thought was going to be a really cute backpack that could hold his little toys, turned out to really be a stuffed Winnie the Pooh doll with straps attached to his back so that your child can carry him on his/her back. The ""backpack"" was merely a little dinky bag that Pooh carries around his neck that's big enough to maybe hold some Cheerios - not much more. If the Pooh doll had really been a backpack, there may have been more play/interaction with him, but since it's merely a Pooh doll with straps on his back, once Pooh comes off my son's back he doesn't really care to play with him as the straps are annoying as a play toy. We give this product 1 star, simply because it's a cute idea, but a failed one at that."
3,ok,i used it becasue i bought it. not as good as i thoguht it would be for me. BUT my son loved sleeping in it while it was circled. If i was to get pregnant again i wouldnt buy this stlye.
4,must-have for soon to be mommies!,"I absolutely love it!! And I wish I had ordered it earlier, I think I ordered it @ 22 weeks. The other day we stayed at a hotel and I didn't bring it and I could not sleep at all! The only reason it did not get the full five stars from me, is the little zipper (which may poke you in your sleep); they should have made it 'hidden' in the fabric."
5,Great scope for the price,I really was surprised by the function of the lens caps. The cap over the sight lens is threaded on. That keeps it from getting lost by falling off. Really clear field of vision.
2,Nice Scope - Is it safe?,"I did not keep this product. The scope quality was very good considering the price, I had issue with the warning on the box. It says, the State of California has determined this product to be made with substances that may cause cancer. I must say when I opened the box, I almost fell over due to the odor of PVC like substances. Not sure if that is what is leveraged in production, but PVC is a known carcinogen. I did not think it was worth my families health to keep this scope."
4,Good Spotting Scope fo the Money,"I bought this scope for sighting in my hunting rifles. I normally sight in at 100 yards, so this scope has all the range and resolution I need.If you need the clarity of Nikon or Leupold, this scope might dissapoint you. Also, the construction is good, but it feels light, and I would hate to drop it.Still, I was able to see very clear detail of my shots on papere at 100 yards, so this scope does everything I need it to. Also, it shipped with a nylon soft case, a small tripod, and a hard aluminum case.Overall, I am very happy with this scope. If you're looking for a nice servicable scope at an attractive price point, give the Larsak Blackhawk a look."
3,no title,"Slim little volume that nevertheless is packed full of crafts using shells and stuff that would be found on a beach. And very easy, simple instructions.But the section on shell collection is telling you that the best shells are still filled with a live animal, and, essentially you have to kill it - either by a very slow heat or by burying it in dirt. There seems to me something horribly askew here, though, when a book for children (or anybody for that matter) instructs you to kill an animal, no matter how small, just to add to a collection. And then you have to carefully remove all the remains. This for kids?Still, it does have a useful guide to the different shells of both coasts, plus all the different seaweeds too. Plenty here to keep a crafty kid busy for a summer at the beach."
2,Don't -- you'll be sorry you did,"This piece of furniture is just too poorly built for its purpose. Within a short time of putting it up, two of the coat hooks were useless because the thin wood would not hold them. Not long after, the hinges on the bench top went wacky. At first you could still sort of strong-arm it into usability, but now it's really just plain shot. Unable to put out more money to replace it, we've lived with it for a couple of years, but over and over I regret not spending maybe a little bit more to get something better made."
5,Excellent book! Highly recommended,"Pottenger's nutrition studies of cats clearly indicate the importance of quality nutrition. They also help understand why people in our society have such problems with poor health, given the poor quality food that they consume. The book is relatively easily understandable, as long as you don't put extensive effort into trying to understand the content of the tables of data."
1,Most boring DVD ever,"I was expecting winter scenes of real snow, but it was animated and all four tracks were extactly the same. Don't waste your money."
4,Still good after all these years,"As one who loves remote places and has visited all seven continents, ""Report from Practically Nowhere"" makes me long for a time machine. Ah, for the days of being able to easily enter far-off places without hoards of (gulp!) tourists cluttering about and to be able to find the mayor or prime minister at a local haunt. It leaves me wistful, at the very least.Although lacking much of the detail that those seekers among us long for regarding such remote places, Sack's good fortune at finding and getting to these nations (some which sadly no longer exist) is a blessing for us all. It reminds us that travel, indeed, should be at times spontaneous, educational, revelatory and certainly fun. And Sack has created a good list for those of us who like unique parts of the world to quiz each other and embolden us to discover even more parts of our world that we really want to be among the first to visit."
1,One rotor...really?,"I like how you it recommends that you purchase this with the pads...nice touch. HOWEVER, if you do, you'll receive only ONE rotor and a PAIR of pads. So now, I need to go back and order another rotor to be able to complete the project. I thought it was a good deal, but now that I have to order another rotor, it's not so great. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,BIG mistake! keep shopping!,"First the picture indicates the lid and the gray bottom are connected ""hinged"" together. Nope - 2 separate pieces. It barely stays together - the slightest bump and the clear lid slides off - heat escapes - wasted energy. Second, the giant 1970's bobby-pin shaped clips are a joke - good luck getting them to hold the curler and your hair long enough to curl - plan on buying clam-shaped plastic clips and third, the curlers are not covered in any way to protect hair from direct heat. This set will not ""travel""!! This wasted time-convenient purchase buys me time to shop for a GOOD curler set. Hello - Revlon - it is time to utilize current, energy efficient and healthy technology!!! It IS the 21st century, ya know?"
3,Great for long or thick hair,"These curlers are nice, but I have trouble keeping them in with my fine hair. I bought them to replace my old set that had velvet on them, and I think the velvet helped with my fine hair."
2,very irritating,"I agree with the last review. The lid is useless, and thanks for the idea of using duct tape to keep it on. I put the pins in my drawer because the itty bitty slot they give you for 20+ pins is too small and when you want one they all come out in a tangle.I like the rollers and they heat up fast and hot enough. I have long (waist lenght), thick hair and I get a nice curl, so I give it two stars for that."
1,Do not buy!,"I notice that it takes a long time to heat up. Now, it doesn't work at all! I hate the clip. Do not buy this product...."
3,So-so,Originally thought it was a fast heating set of rollers like others I've had; it wasn't but works fine if you don't mind waiting a while for the rollers to heat up.
4,good enough,"Every time I get a new one of these, they seem just a little bit more cheaply made. This one is virtually identical to the one I had before (though it had ""Conair,"" I think, where ""Revlon"" is now), and what happened to it was the same as what another reviewer described: One day the back row of rollers just melted onto its posts. I wouldn't be surprised it the same thing happened to this one, too, some day, since I almost always get that smell of hot plastic when I turn it on. Also, I don't think the rollers hold their heat as well as the old ones--and none of the plastic ones do as well as the more ceramic ones do. It's hard to find sets with the spiked rollers rather than the flocked ones, though, which I find impossible to use. Why is it so difficult to find well-made products? But, so far it's doing well enough what I bought it to do."
1,Waste of Money,"If you have thick hair don't buy this. The rollers don't hold enough hair so you would need 2 sets and when you unroll your hair it tangles easily. The curls don't last at all!! Wish I would have saved the box, they would have been returned."
4,Useful tips to consider in your web ad strategy,"I bought this book to understand the concepts and methods behind search engine marketing and it is exactly what this book delivers. It explains sufficiently how people search on the web according to their buying phase, how to research your keywords, how to organize and start an ad campaign and how to follow up.It focuses mostly in Google adwords since it is the most widespread advertising agency on the web. Author refers also to some third party tools for keyword searching, bidding and statistics.Finally, I felt confortable with book's chapters regarding their order and division."
5,SEO & SEM Success Made Easy,"I am totally impressed with Heather Lutze's ability to translate the world of SEO and SEM into easy-to-implement strategy and tactics. What might have taken me a couple of years to figure out, I am now able to comprehend and apply in a month or two. In fact, two SEO ""experts"" I talked to did not even know about aligning one's key word terms with the three phases of the customer buying cycle, which is the critical step Heather teaches to managing successful SEO and SEM campaigns. Thank you Heather Lutze!"
2,Didn't help much,"Used this product for a while and couldn't see much of a difference. If the claims sound too good to be true, they probably are."
5,Excelente,Fué despachado a tiempo y llegó en perfectas condiciones.El perfume es original no es copia.El precio excelente también. Vale la pena comprarlo. Lo recomiendo.
5,A good rose scent,"This is a very clean, no nonsense rose scent. It is not heavy, cloying or overly complicated. The scent opens up beautifully and lasts a long time. I like it alone or combined with other fragrances."
2,"Funny, but not as good as the original","A big Nunsense fan, but this one kind of drug on and on. Sister Amnesia, as always, had the best lines and stole the show."
3,I made a mistake ...,I misread the description and thought I was getting something else. My grandchildren watched it (ages 7 & 4) and got quite bored with it. It was interesting but a bit too much for them. Maybe when they are a few years older they will view it differently.
3,Where Was The Editor?,"The book fills in a lot of background to the early songs and their settings, such as Islay and Mexico. It also gives the reader a clear idea of what Donovan was doing before 'Catch the Wind' hit the charts. However, I would have appreciated a bit more detail on the development of his guitar picking styles.He is disarmingly honest about his treatment of the women with whom he shared relationships, stopping short of admitting he was a total bastard to one of them.Donovan shed some new light on the decline of Brian Jones and on his relationships with the Beatles, both musically and otherwise.The book needed a good editor and some thorough proofreading. There are many spelling, typographical and grammatical errors. And worst of all, in spite of it being listed in the Contents, there is no Index.Overall, it is an easy read and it had me rummaging through my Donovan LPs from the 1970s and enjoying a bit of nostalgia."
2,Bursting his own bubble,"I'm disappointed. Donovan bursts all romantic images we have of him without leaving anything to take its place. Instead we get accounts of endless ""events"" and the long lists of celebrities attached to each. Historical and musical inaccuracies, not to mention editorial carelessness. We get to hear of his selfish motives as he treats women callously, including Enid, all while supposedly in search of his true love and muse. And brag brag brag.Lucky for me I read this before Christmas, so I won't make the mistake of giving this as a gift. I'll let my Donovan fan friends keep their 60s image of him. This book taints what I still believe is wonderful music by showing Donovan as selfish and egocentric."
5,Smokin' Setzer!!!,"Everything I hoped for. Setzer just rocks and I love the Big Band behing him. They really round out the sound. Just a dynamic show- fun, entertaining and inspiring. If you want vintage Setzer and enjoy a good time, get a hold of this one. You won't be sorry!"
5,Awesome!!,Smells amazing!!! My husband loves it!!!Found this over while visiting our son in the UK and had to get it for him for Christmas... so glad I did :)
1,Terrible,That is really terrible...Thats why it is so cheap. I think you shouldnt waste your money with this cologne..I m so regret that I bought it... There are a lot of colognes which are better than this cologne..
4,good product,My wife bought this product because of its low price but more because other buyers' positive review. I sprayed it right after the product arrived and a few friends asked me the brand. I spray it in the morning and the sexy smell lasts longer than I expected. Good buy!
3,it is really ok,"am a guy who loves to try new thingI like it though , but I went back to my old perfume ( CK )"
2,Disappointing,"The scope is very sharp and bright at the lowest magnification, 22X, but as soon as you zoom it in past 30X or 40X the picture becomes murky and detail is lost. I had the scope firmly mounted and was looking at a pine tree about 100 yards away. At 22X I could easily make out individual pine cones and each individual branch. When I zoomed in to 40X, it turned into a green blotch with fuzzy brown spots for pine cones. At 66X I could no longer even make out the pine cones. So essentially you have a scope that is very good at 22X and basically worthless beyond for any type of viewing that you need detail, such as birding or hunting.I returned mine, spent the extra $100 and bought a Leupold Wind River Sequoia that is outstanding !"
3,Not as satisfying as her others.,"This one didn't appeal to me as much as ""Games of Pleasure"". For one, I didn't care for the period in which it was set. Just my personal preference. I don't like my heroes in wigs, stockings, and buckled shoes.Also, however much implied, I didn't feel the chemistry and the longing I was anticipating between the protagonists.I do so enjoy Ms. Ross' ""experienced"" heroines. It's a refreshing break from the norm and shows that she isn't afraid to step outside the box of this genre.Still a pleasing read, but not one of my favorites."
1,THEY CAN'T SHIP WHAT YOU ORDER!!!,"I've tried to get this item twice from this vendor. The first time they sent me a 1-inch curling iron and, when I tried to return, claimed that their files showed they sent me the correct iron. I tried another order, and this time they sent me the wrong model (1110 instead of 1130) with a spring clamp instead of Marcel Grip. It is costing me a fortune to get a stupid curling iron. Do Not Order From This Vendor!!!"
3,Interesting but weak,Great price with 6 packs but it is really weak. It takes two tea bags to make the tea as strong as others.
2,way too many sunflower seeds,"This cereal is fresh, healthy, and beautifully packaged. There are just WAY too many sunflower seeds! Sunflower seeds are listed as the 3rd ingredient after whole grain wheat and date crumbles. Every bite is a mouthful of sunflower seeds and the taste overwhelms the other ingredients. If you like sunflower seeds a lot, this is the cereal for you. But I don't care for how prominent the flavor and texture of sunflower seeds are in this product."
1,GENIUS....PURE GENIUS,"Robert Rundle is a genius. How he conned anyone into giving him money to film this piece of ... is beyond me. I do give credit to the emotion in this movie, namely it causing a sense of suicidal despair. I would have ... ... ... away 80 minutes of my life than sit through this thing. Oh no, I'm getting the headaches again."
2,Not for thick or long hair!,"I purchased this straightener when I lost my original one moving. BIG MISTAKE. My other one was the exact same size and straightened my hair in less than half the time. This one simply does not get hot enough to straighten my medium length, thick, and wavy hair. My hair isn't even warm after running the straightener through it. Because of this, I waste so much time! If you have thin or short hair, it might work, but I would still suggest trying a different product."
3,It's ok.,"I've had this straightener for a while and it does the job, but my hair is really pretty darn straight anyway; i only use this to get the ""wrinkles"" out after i've slept on my hair. It heats up pretty fast, but it also is constantly catching my hair and pulling it out- be very careful and straighten small sections to minimize the hair pulling."
2,Revlon Review,"Didn't get as hot as i thought and left my hair super dry, not real ceramic and the plates aren't long enough for longer hair."
1,Junk,"I ditto the other review. This is exactly what happened to us. The faucet is less than a year old and the spigot is almost impossible to turn it is so tight. We took it apart and greased it, but it did no good. If we loosen the ring, it spews water all over the kitchen. I simply can't believe Moen would sell this garbage. I have since learned that people in the know advise against using Moen faucets in the kitchen due to the numerous problems."
1,who can get to the product through the horrible package?,"I ordered this to replace a prior product. If you order it, then GOOD LUCK getting into the package. It is the most frustratingly packaged product you will ever find. RIDICULOUS and INACCESSIBLE!@"
2,Loud and a little difficult to use,"This does the job but not easily. The handle is large and a bit difficult to maneuver. The brush gets hot fast so be prepared. I tend to use it on the lower or cool settings. Finally it is loud, loud like a leaf blower. I put ear plugs in whenever I use it otherwise it is too troublesome. All in all it styles well but I am going to search for a quieter product."
1,Revlon RV440C 1200W Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler caught on fire!,I purchased this product 5/24/10 to replace the older model which died only 6 months after I bought it. I plugged in the dryer and instantly sparks and smoke started coming out of the swivel area where the cord connects. Beware!
1,Beware,"Would have loved this product if it hadn't broken the second time I used it. Tried the restart button; gave it time to cool. Nothing worked, so I returned it. Noticed many people had similar problems from the reviews. Now I'm starting over to find something that will actually work. Very frustrating!"
2,Bring back the old model!,"I agree with some of the other negative reviews. I've used the Revlon dryer styler round brush for years. When they die, I replace them. The former one didn't last as long as the others and this new one has designed those openings to keep it from overheating. Well, not only does it vent very hot air, it blows the surrounding hair in all directions, undoing what you just did. I came online to try to track down an older model."
5,Revolutionized my hair regimen,"The Revlon hot air dryer and styler is the best invention. I cannot handle a dryer and a separate brush so this solves my problem. I used to use electric rollers (have hundreds of them) but using this hot air dryer and styler lets me do my hair, including drying it to damp with a regular dryer, in about 12 minutes. Plus the bristles are great--they hold hair better than Conair rubber type bristle. I'd give it six stars if possible."
2,Stops working after a while.,"I've bought 2 of these and both stopped working after a few months. I had it for about 6 months or longer and I loved it. Then recently, It heats up and works for a few minutes then just stops. The ion light stays on but just stops drying and rotating. It'll work again but then shut off right away after you let it cool. It sucks!!!! I bought it at Rite Aid so maybe their stock is bad? I don't know, but I would really like to get something similar, because it's a great hair tool when it's not faulty.Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue"
2,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","I'm on my third one of these. The question is why do I keep buying it? Well, the attachments are great, the hot and cool settings are perfect and (when it works) it does a great job styling my hard-to-style hair.The first one I bought didn't work right out of the package and I returned it. The second one worked for about 4 months, then finally died while I was on vacation. The one I have now screams louder than any hair dryer you've ever heard, and after about three minutes you can see a bright flare-up inside the unit and the heating element is done for the day. It still blows cool air, but it would take about 20 minutes to do the other half of my head that isn't styled yet. A half-done head of hair doesn't really suit my sense of style.Great product design, lousy innards. I'm off on a search to find one that actually works. If I'd bought a more expensive one off the bat, would I have actually saved? We'll see."
1,poorly made,"I bought this item last month at Target, I needed a way to straighten, and curl my hair because I have shoulder problems, so it hurts to hold up a round brush and hair dryer. The product is very loud, the buttons are poorly located. It also gets very hot to hang on to. The concept is great, but mine has already cracked at the base where the brush attaches, that wasn't sturdy at all, it only attached at the front and I was forever hitting that release button and having the brush fall off! I tried to find a Revlon website to contact the company, but all I can find is the makeup part of the company. Do not buy this product!"
1,On my 4th one since Dec,"I love this product for what it does for my hair WHEN IT WORKS! I am on my 4th one since December and the only reason I keep getting the same one is because I keep exchanging it. The first one was broken right out of the package, the button clip that keeps the brush on was broken, the 2nd one burned out, the 3rd one, the little screen on the bottom broke off and it smells like it is burning and the 4th one was purchased on Friday and died on Tuesday. I finally wrote to the manufacturer!!! I am exchanging again today for a different model. I hope the new one I get works as good but more importantly, I hope it keeps working!!!"
5,An indispensable tool,"This was the second time I purchased this hot air dryer & styler (the first one broke through my carelessness, and was in no way due to a manufacturing defect). I have used this dryer for three years and have been impressed with its performance. I have very fine hair which does not hold style well & I am not particularly talented when it comes to doing my own hair. Even so, with this producut I am able to dry & style my hair every morning and would be lost without this hot air brush. I have not used Revlon's ceramic version yet, so I cannot attest to whether this is better than that one or not. Lastly, I have had horrible luck with hair dryers in the past, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how this dryer withstood years of travel and use. It is a very well contructed product."
5,Revlon Hot Air Dryer/Styler,This Dryer and Styler is ideal for my hair. It is much easier to use than a round brush and dryer separately like the professional stylists do. I could not do without it.
1,Revlon Hot Air Dryer and Styler,This product stopped working after I used it 4 times. The iron got too hot and overheated. Before it overheated it did work well.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00022WA9K/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,A nifty tool,"This is a great little tool if you want to get a little flip in your hair, but it shouldn't replace your regular dryer. It won't give your hair as much body as a regular dryer can, and the handle is sorta big and unwieldy. But it does put a nice flip in your hair and quickly too."
3,Boats building,"The book have basic content. Present some hints that help a novice, but don't stands projects and details how to do."
1,Unwatchable,"Basically this one is Ernest Borgnine as J. Edgar Hoover engaging in a series of rants about Hoover's side of the various eras and issues of the FBI. If you are expecting a movie or something, forget it. I would not even give this one a single star if Amazon didn't make me. Not recommended. RJB."
1,Missing Stuff,"The shelf unit was delivered without the necessary hardware and braces to assemble the unit. The wrong size dividers were sent with the bins. Finally got the right size dividers for the bins, but not before they requested that I pay a restocking charge (even though it wasn't my fault). Still haven't received the hardware even though I called a couple of times. I guess $300 doesn't buy you much anymore."
3,Pretty good for the money,"Considering that this is a pretty inexpensive dustbuster, it's not bad. It does blow air out the back when running, which is a little strange because the air blows in your face. And I wouldn't say it's super powerful. But overall it does the job, and sure beats cleaning up my 16 month-old son's messes by hand. :-)"
4,Not bad,Not a bad little vac for the price. I use it in my motorhome. The only thing I don't like is the way the charger plugs in.
2,not as good as before,"This dust buster is not nearly as good as the old Black & Decker 9.6 volt wet/dry dust buster. I used the old one all the time, and loved it. The new one is less powerful, falls off its stand easily and unexpectedly so that it doesn't recharge, and is hard to take apart and put back together. I don't know what got into the people at B & D."
5,Fantastic!,"I purchased one of these ""like new"" at the Goodwill. It's awesome. I have used it for two years with no problems! Easy to clean, rechargeable, and worth the 20 bucks!! I highly recommend it."
2,Not what is advertised,"First, the con side of this. The advertisement for this product is that it fits the Motorola RAZR V3c V3m phones. I have a V3m phone and the tabs on the cover do not match up with the slots on the phone. The product cover has a single tab just off center, and my V3m has slots for 2 tabs - one on each side. The next thing is that the battery advertised is not what you get. The advertisement says it is a 1400mAh battery. What arrived is a 1300mAh battery. Not a huge difference, but a difference nonetheless. Shipping was fair - about what is expected from an Amazon market store. There was the usual delay from Amazon receiving the order, then passing it along to the market store, and them finally processing the order (side note: I really don't like that Amazon works this way now - nothing ever ships quickly anymore).On the pro side, the return of the item went well and painless. The full refund showed up on my credit card within about 10 days from when I shipped the product back."
1,Photo is deceiving,"Although the image clearly shows a pot, and the label on that pot says Honey Bee Dipper, the item is actually one wooden stick with a bumble bee on it. If you are looking for a DIPPER, this is it. If you are looking for what is in the PICTURE, you will be disappointed. Also, this company was very slow to respond to email inquiries, and very short and terse in their answers. I did not attempt to return the product even though I was very unhappy with it. They are just too difficult to deal with and it wasn't worth the trouble to me."
5,cute and well made,This honey dipper is so cute and it is well made! My children love the little bee on top of it! Clean up is a breeze as well!
1,Do Not Buy-Much Smaller Battery Inside.,"I ordered this product to apply the large energy density to a purpose other than a PSP game player. My use required removing the actual battery from the plastic housing. I was shocked to discover that the cell is actually much smaller than the packaging around it; it's mostly empty space inside! The battery is less than half the size of a 2200mah pack and about equal to a 1200. I've read from others that this is the case and now I believe it! Not only that but when I used it, it drained exceedingly fast--much faster than the worn-out battery I was replacing.So if you need a small, cheap, inferior battery perhaps to replace a non-working one, you CAN buy this one. Just don't think you're getting a fantastic bargain. You're really being led astray!"
4,"Very good battery for psp 1000, just needs better fit","This is a very good battery for your psp 1000, gives as much time on change as the original one. The only problem is that it is a little hard to put the battery cover with that battery.If you are just using 1 battery, this is perfectly for you, because you will only need to adjust the battery cover once, so it can have a good fit. On the other hand, if you have multiple batteries and you want to be changing them, this is not the battery for you.Ps. The battery works perfectly, only a little hard to fit in, that's why the 4 starts."
1,It did not live up to expectation,"It's not lasting as long as anticipated, it is simply not great. I would not recommend it to anyone at all."
4,Ideal gift for anyone from this region of Cuba,"This DVD comes across primarily as a travel video set to music. So it is not a documentary or educational, if that is what you are looking for, you may want to pass on this item. However, if you want to see some of the beautiful sights that Santiago Cuba has to offer, this is a great video for you.My husband and his family left Santiago de Cuba in the late 1960s and they were thrilled with this DVD. It gave the the opportunity to see places they longed to be, but sadly can no longer return to. One elderly member of our family watched it so much, we bought a second copy for fear that he would end up wearing it out!"
3,This book was pretty good but has been modified to much!,This book had the same character and basic plotline as the realy epic Ramayana. But this book has been americanized a little too much! The illustrations for the cover look NOTHING like Indian Culture paintings!!
3,"Amusing, but not what I thought","I bought this book because of the title and reviews. It was amusing, but not the greatest book and certainly not what I had expected."
2,Not the same as it was a few years ago,"We loved Pampers Swaddlers when our daughter was an infant. Now that we have a newborn again, this was the first product I bought. Unfortunately, the product seems to have changed for the worse (perhaps because of the dry max). Although I still like the soft, non-plastic feel of the diaper, the liner sticks to my baby's bottom and gives terrible diaper rash. We've now switched to Huggies Little Snugglers and they are far superior to these. Pampers should know they lost a devoted customer!"
2,"Decent diapers, though no wetness indicator!!!","I'm very disappointed that these don't have the wetness indicator. There's no way to tell the baby wet the diaper unless you open up the diaper. Pampers still had the indicator on the size N diapers I bought, so I'm not sure why these don't have it. It makes checking for a wet diaper a needless hassle."
1,Not true to size,"The swaddler size 1-2 is the same, if not smaller than the sensitive size 1. Bummed that I had to return them. Maybe that's why they've discontinued it?!"
3,Size 2 not as good as Huggies,It's ok to use Pampers for size newborn and size 1 but when it comes size 2 and above I use huggies.
3,Think I got a defective package,My son is 8 weeks old and I have been using swadlers the entire time. I like that it had a wetness indicator in the front that I could see through a onesie. This package came quick and well protected BUT the diapers had a very small only a couple inch wetness indicator strip on them and they weren't in the front they were on toward the butt. I wasn't happy with that. I have been using them hoping the diaper would be just as good and they were still absorbent. It makes me kind of hesitant to purchase these diapers on here again. I think I may have to try a different brand so I get what I pay for.
5,Pampers Diapers are the best!,I would recommend Pampers diapers to anyone with a child. They work great! I wish they had the swaddler brand when they get to the bigger sizes.
5,Great value,We got these from Amazon since they were cheaper than any place around where we live. My son has sensitive skin so once we settled on this brand it's all we buy. The 'notification' strip is a nice touch so you aren't having to pull them out of their seat to check.
5,Perfect product for keeping baby happy and parents peace of mind,"Ever have a crying baby and you are thinking to yourself, is it a hunger cry? Too tired? Wet diaper?This product puts peace of mind your hands with a fantastic wetness indicator from front to back that is yellow when dry and blue when wet. Taking one of the 3 main reasons that the baby is crying out of the equation just makes our lives as parents that much easier.Our daughter has had a couple of 'blowouts' but never anything that this diaper could not handle so far in her first 2 months. She has used these diapers from birth in the hospital until today and they have worked great. I highly recommend this diaper for all parents, couple this with a reasonable Amazon price and the 'Amazon Mom' program (even for the dads like me out there); you end up with a great all around buy. Sign up for regular delivery of these at a frequency that meets your family's needs and you'll thank yourself later."
5,Love these diapers,"I recently gave birth to my second child, and like before I am using Pampers Swaddlers. These diapers are wonderful for a newborns skin. They are so soft and actually hold really well from leaks. I'm not a big fan of Pampers leak guard diapers, but these are nothing like those. I highly recomend them."
3,Good price at Amazon once you Subscribe and Save,"They are diapers, and with an infant...well, it's not like he's going to complain about this.It does the job - keeps his clothes dry, and the poop in. I would NOT RECOMMEND this for night time sleeping if the kid is fortunate enough to sleep through a good chunk of hours (say 4-5) as the combo of poop and pee will cause an overflow and leak out. But for infants that have a sleep cycle of 2-3 hours at most, it seems sufficient.I would try cheaper diapers (say target and other store brands)....but i like the fact that they show up on my doorstep and the price isn't bad with the Subscribe and Save option."
1,Inferior quality product compared to smaller packaging!!,"We'd bought a 40-pack of the EXACT same product from a local store while waiting for this shipment to arrive. The diapers from the 40-pack fit our baby beautifully and worked great. The ones from this pack of 234, however, leaked from the sides. Upon close inspection we found that the padding in this one was significantly less, and the size was just, and I mean JUST, a tad bigger. It was a messy clean-up! We gave it the benefit of doubt for a one-time occurrence, but this happened three times. It is not worth the money saved for that cleaning time and effort - just obtained a return label from Amazon a few moments ago.It's really hard for me to believe that a brand like Pampers could do something like this!"
3,Love swaddlers but...,"I've been using pampers swaddlers on my 3 month old, I absolutely LOVED the newborn size and size 1, but I just moved up to size 2 and there is an AWEFUL fake baby powder smell! I'm NOT a fan. Other than the awful smell...I really love the diapers, I wish they would eliminate that oder. I see from some other reviews that it has caused a rash on their babies, I've been using them for a few days now and no rash, I'm really hoping one doesn't develop! I'm pretty bummed that I bought this huge pack of diapers thinking they would be the same type of diapers as size one...."
5,Excellent Quality,"I used Pampers for my children years and years and years ago and loved them then. 30 years later, they only gotten better! Love the fact the these diapers have an ultra-dry layer with aloe for extra protection. The fit is perfect, no leak factor, and wetness indicator are all new improvements in the Pampers product over the years.Pampers brand, is a name you can trust and this particular variety is highly recommended. Wouldn't buy any other brand."
4,Great!,"We use Pampers Swaddlers for my five month old and they are wonderful!!! I've also tried Huggies. We've had little to no leaks since switching to Pampers and he is sleeping 10-12 hours without a diaper change. They are great. Subscribe and save is fantastic, one less thing to think about!"
4,Baby Shower Gift,"My very good friend had this on her registry and I had it shipped to her home. She received it in good time. My only complaint would be that when she received the package it didn't have my name on it, so she had no idea who it was from."
2,would be great except for the rash,"They diapers are great as far as fit and containing leaks and poop (every baby has the occasional explosion). The issue was that my sweet baby boy got the most awful rash that I thought for a long time was caused by yeast because it was so red and raw. I tried every single method: washing with water, air drying, sun time, expensive diaper creams, probiotics, etc. Finally I decided to switch to Huggies Pure and Natural to see if it would help (after a month of battling that rash). The rash disappeared within 2 days. I was still not sure if it was the diapers, so after a week of him having a great bum, I put him back in the pampers I had left over (I hate wasting money....). He started getting the rash again after 1 day, so I immediately stopped again. Sad. I like them other than whatever perfumes or chemicals are obviously in them."
4,Best diapers,"As a first time mother, I did not know what diapers to get. I wanted to give my son the best and thought that the natural diapers by Huggy's would be the best for the environment and him. That was our first experience with diapers and let's just say...we started parenthood thinking baby's pee and poop through all their diapers. We changed him his cloths about 7 times a day as they leaked through. Once these diapers were out, we decided to try these Pampers Swaddlers. Thank God for them. They have saved us money in our electricity bill as our washing was minimized. He barely leaks through them. He will leak don't get me wrong but it only occurs on average 2 times a week. My husband picked up Pampers Dry & ___ the other day and tried them. We took them back after 3 diaper changes. They were way worse then the Huggy's. Get the Swaddlers. They will save you time and money in the long run."
3,"Was ok, started to leak","We started out using Huggies little snugglers simply because that' what my mom gave us for our first newborn package as well as what the hospital used. They were fine, so I started a subscription with Amazon. Amazon ran out at the time we needed another pack, so I tried Pampers. They worked, too, so we just kept using them. We we're close to out and I didn't request another pack soon enough, so we bought a pack of huggies from the store to hold us over. When we ran out of the huggies and were back in pampers, we realized how much the pampers leaked in comparison. Not all the time, but enough that I've been folding over a little flap in the back to catch any spills out the top. Inevitably, the big poos happen when I didn't take the extra time to do this... The huggies lil movers are one cent more per diaper - I deem that worth it."
3,there is no <wet or not wet indicator on dippers>,"It is very good dippers, but I think there is something missing, as wet or not wet indicator line on dippers. I used to buy from Target, never had Pampers brand dippers without that indicator.I did not expect to see this difference. So be warned before you buy it."
5,Best Diapers!!,"These are the best diapers I have used. They are soft, flexible, and easily adjustable for a good secure fit. They hold leaks extremely well. Of course leaks do occur (why wouldn't they if your baby has, say for example, 4 explosive poops in the course of 5 minutes....it's happened), however this is to be expected. They do not occur regularly and the diapers are not saggy, but fit very snuggly which provides for good protection. I HIGHLY recommend these."
4,Best Deal on Subscribe and Save over any store Price!,"These diapers are the best for holding your babies loads. : ) When you get them at the subscribe and save price or have a prime membership, which I got for free for buying baby products, they beat any store price - including Wal-Mart, Sams etc....The only con that I have found are small dots of white on the inside top front and back that are rough and potentially could scratch or irritate the baby. We have found these on most all of the diapers in all of the boxes that we have received but the baby doesn't fuss and we don't see any scratches so it must be okay."
4,Much better than any other brand,"These are better than their competitive brands. No leakage and no marks so far ... I used others too, and they turned out to be really bad.So coming back to pampers."
5,Love Pampers Swaddlers,"Best fit, no leakage and last for longer hours especially overnight. Tried Huggies but did not work for our precious Maddy."
5,Great Order,"Greatly enjoyed my purchase! preparing for my baby to debut and making monthly purchases to stock up before April 16, 2013"
3,a little disappointed,"I loved swaddlers for my daughter up until now, she moves around a lot and we are now experiencing blow outs with the diapers. Had a sample of cruisers size 3 and these seem to be a better solution for my busy baby"
5,Best Deal,Best way to buy diapers hands down. Its cheaper and you dont have to leave your house. The diapers are exactly the same as the store diapers so I am not sure why you wouldnt buy from Amazon unless they were on sale somewhere else. If you plan properly the subscribe and save is a good deal or if not Amazon Prime gets you the diapers in 2 days for free.
1,"Caused diapers rash within a week, many with damaged tabs","Switched from Baby Dry to Swaddlers, and regretting it ...I was using Pampers Baby Dry for 6 months, and my baby girl never had a rash.But the diaper leaked once in a while, and i read very good reviews of Swaddlers, regarding leakage, so tried it out. It gave my baby rashes within a week of using it. Also i have used only one of three ""sub-packets"" in the box, and we've found atleast 5 diapers where one or both tabs were damaged or missing.i am not at all happy with this product. We switched back to pampers baby dry, and her rashes have gone down within 3 - 4 days of switching back."
5,Love this product!,"Love this product! Happy every time we use it. Love the wetness indicator, my husband even knows when to change the diaper!!"
5,Great diapers,"I love these diapers, they do not leak if the child is under 6lbs and they are nice and soft."
5,Fastest shipping,"Completely satisfied with this product. Shortest time for delivery ever ( for New York ) all the time i've got shipment after next business day, compare with other seller on Amazon, you can wait your package as long as couple weeks. So far, no any problem at all."
1,Waste of money,"This swadlers is very smelly and really bad diapers. I still have more than half left. My husband wants me throw away leftover ones. It gave my little one really bad diaper rash. I tryed everything to stop the rash. It stopped when i change the pampers to huggies. I think some babies ok with pampers. Some are not. All my friends happy with pampers. But not me. Also i figured out that back of the pampers is not stretchy and tight. So when baby has blowout. Everything will comeout in your baby's back and it will be mess to clean up your baby, onesie, and everything around it."
5,The best ever!,"I set this purchase up as a gift to my daughter and granddaughter (recipient). I love the fact that its a gift that keeps on giving and it is automatically replenished. The product is great and my daughter loves the quality and convenience. The service is flexible, (I can postpone shipments or order more), I get advanced notifications of shipments, and I can add more or delete as nesessary. I think this is a great service and recommend that anyone who wants to help a new momma, this is the way to go! Plus, with all momma has to do with a new baby, this is one thing less she has to worry about!Grandpa"
5,Best diapers out there,The best diapers hands down. Huggies equal huge poopy blow-out. I am so bummed--my daughter is in Size 3 diapers now so has outgrown Swaddlers. I would love it if they made Size 3 and up. I always give this big box as a shower gift and my friends love it.
5,Great diapers & very fast shipping,"My wife and I really like these diapers. They fit perfectly on our 1 month old and the urine indicator strip is great. In addition, we received the diaper the day before the estimated delivery date. We have Amazon Prime so we have free 2 day shipping but getting it in 1 day is just awesome especially when diapers are involved."
1,Pampers Swadlers really work,"I am a new mother who was really not sure what type of diapers to use for my son. These were the ones the used in the hospital so we bought them. Then other people bought us diapers as well Huggies and some other Pampers styles. I began to use them and saw that they weren't nearly as good. The swaddlers keep my little guy comfy and dry. I found that the other ones leaked when he was both wet or dirty, the swaddlers don't. Also I like that they have sizes and in between sizes as well for your growing baby. I definitely recommend these to others."
1,Never had this problem but this one.,This product is awesome BUT Amazon's not even shipping the item I ordered 5 weeks ago and keep pushing the shipping date out. I would consider this item as a time sensitive item as baby grows. I hope I don't receive this item when my baby's in high school.
2,Not so great!,"My baby is 16 pounds. Pampers Size 2 is up to 18 pounds, so they do fit on her, but somehow she's had serious diaper rash by wearing them in the past few days. I know these diapers might be a little tight for her, but she didn't have diaper rash while wearing Huggies Size 2 whioh were also a bit tight."
5,Fast shipping!,Very happy with this product..fast shipping and packed perfectly!Will purchase from this seller in future!
5,Good Product,"Our son likes swaddlers , our first baby ( now he is 3 ) grew up on these and had no issues. I guess this became a tradition for us."
5,AWESOME DVD!!!,"I VHS taped this many years ago from a PBS special, and only watched it about once a year, because I was afraid I'd wear the tape out. I was so excited to see it on DVD! If you are a Gospel Music fan, this is what you are looking for. And Morgan Freeman playing the part of the Minister/Narrator makes this a treasure! Enjoy!"
1,Not a Roman sword,"This is not a Roman sword style. The Romans didn't use swords like this. Hollywood uses this stuff, but it's NOT historical. Reenactors should not buy these swords. They are fine for fantasy RP/LARP and costumes."
3,sick and sorry,"boxed very poorly, two large books in with two air bubbles all the way to Australia in one innefficient box. Very poor thought gone into this service provided by Amazon, get your act together or headaches all round. sorry not good enough."
4,Excellent,"This story line is not my favorite from Grant Morrison's Doom Partol run, but it's still very good.I gave up on comics around the time Grant quit Doom Patrol, Shade the Changing Man made it to issue 50 and The Sandman plodded to it's long winded end. While Preacher and the Invisibles were excellent series', nothing compares to Grant's Doom Patrol.Fans of the strange should do themselves a favor and grab this book. Although I believe that The Painting That Ate Paris trade paperback is a superior collection.Hopefully DC will continue to pound out these Doom Patrol collections."
3,Battery clip on cigarette lighter,I am pleased with this product. I have it on my car that has a problem with the factory installed lighter. I put an extension on the cable and ran it under the hood and through the door of the car. I use it to power my GPS and charge my cell phone when I am on the road.
3,Works; looks longer in the photo,"Works fine but I downgraded because it looks longer in the photograph, however, it is only about 24"" length. There is also a cap for the cigarette adapter end that is not shown in the photo."
1,"Good idea, but they don't hold up.","I got two of these. One arrived with the solder joint on the clip end already popped off, which I fixed, and the other lost connectivity on the sealed socket end within the first few uses. I'm considering returning them. They just aren't well enough built to hold up."
4,great for the price,this was a bargain at under $5. seems like decent quality and should last for a few years at the least. my only complaint: the clips don't open up very wide. they only open wide enough to clamp onto the bolt that holds the cable to the battery terminal. they worked just fine but not the most versatile if you need to clamp onto a bigger connection.i use it to power my portable compressor.
3,Satisfactory device,"This battery clip-on cigarette lighter socket works well and adds a convenient outlet for 12V power. The device seems well made and is well worth its cost. The only negative comment is that I would prefer a longer cord. This item is as described at the purchase site, but it would be more useful with the cord perhaps 6 or 8 feet long."
2,Lacks Toughness,"This model seems to get over-hyped for its features, but I recommend looking elsewhere for a better model. After only a few weeks on the job, the lower blade guard cracked near it's hub, causing it to hit the blade. The saw may be of light weight, but it comes at the expense of low-quality materials that do not belong on a power tool. This saw is not rugged enough, and several other people have experienced the same breakage of the same part."
1,Wheres the photo's?,"No Photos in this book! How do you know what it should look like, or if it even appears appetizing? I need photos in my recipe books, I wont be buying anymore of her cookbooks. Very disappointed!"
4,Beautiful book for dreamers,"Adirondack Style takes me back to summer camp and family vacations! As the title says, it is devoted to just one second-home style. In any case, I loved it, but I also recommend Cottage Style, a decorating book that shows a lot of weekend-house decorating ideas (that work even if you don't have a weekend house!). I also bought New Cottage Home, which is about designs for building new weekend homes."
4,fun to build,I bought this for my 7 year old son. The girder system was easy to use but putting on the plastic windows was harder. I helped my son but he probably could build it himself. The toy was sturdy. Great case to store the pieces.
4,A bargain for a watch made in Italy,I got this product at one of amazon's sales with a price in the teens. didn't have much expectation but it came in a nice box and actually looked very slick. Especially goes well with a long sleeved dress shirt. What surprised me most is there was a 'Made in Italy' sticker on the box.
4,"a quick, absorbing, read that draws you in immediately","I have all the Sister Joan paperbacks published so far and this is my favorite in the series. Her descriptions make the weather, countryside, and events seem almost palpable. Her comments on convent life and the life of a nun give even a Roman Catholic like me rare insights into a profession that itself is mysterious."
5,composter review,Excellent product. Directions make it easy to use. A person probably needs two to keep a constant flow of compost.
1,Deals mostly with copper,"This booklet only deals with copper tubing embedded in a concrete slab. The author only gives token mention to other tubing products such as PEX, rubber, etc. Also, there is almost no mention of using radiant floor heat under a wood framed floor. If you are planning a copper tube/under slab installation, this appears to be a good book. However, if you are planning to use PEX tubing, or install a system under a wood framed floor, skip it."
2,Mac Version is Mediocre...,"I don't know how good the PC version of this program is, but I have to say the Mac version is rather awkward and poor. Yes, you *can* print decent looking labels and jewelcase liners with the software-- and the stomper device itself does work quite well. But, the software user interface is terrible. Basic actions like cut-and-paste aren't permitted, let alone drag-and drop. If you accidentally start using the wrong template, you can't convert to another one (let alone cut-and-paste the data), you have to start over from scratch. The clip art and patterns provided are OK, but unremarkable-- and I haven't seen a lot of support out there (i.e. new patterns or clip art to download).In short, it works. But there surely must be something better out there, no?"
3,Heartwarming Fluff About Fathers!,"Writer-Photographer Nick Kelsh offers up some wise thoughts and charming images of Fatherhood in this slight 2002 release from Stewart, Tabor & Chang.HOW TO BE DAD is one of those 'extras' gift books people get on special occasions. The book is only 48 pages long so Kelsh's insights are pretty basic yet will resonate with all the dads out there. I thought HOW TO BE DAD was a little over-priced at $14.95 but that's just me.Overall, Kelsh's book is short and sweet and an optional buy."
5,Great service!,Thank you so much for your fast service! Received just days after ordering. Thank you.
3,Good But....Not as good...,"It's gonna be very hard for Jason to top his debut CD or at least to me. I have over 400 CD's and Jason Aldeans 1st CD is the very best I have, so I could be a little bias. However this CD is definately worth buying. It's really good with lots of different emotions, slow songs, rockabilly and songs that pull on your heart strings. I am a hugh Jason Aldean fan and I'll buy whatever he releases. I've been patiently awaiting this release and ran out immediately and got it. It's really good but not as good as his debut cd.Go ahead, buy it, you'll like it!"
2,Not Too Good,"This is not as good a work as it had the potential of being. At 199 pages it is short, made shorter still by small pages with large type.Bouncing from topic to topic, it is an uncoordinated effort. It appears to have been rushed. There are so many ibids and multiple referrals to the same source material in the bibliography that you begin to wonder just how much work went into the research behind it. I was sorry I purchased it."
5,Here is our digital era at its best!,"Rising from the very heart of manned Lunar exploration, this book put the Apollo guidance computer in a very privileged site above other contemporary computers. So compact, and reliable, it had leaded the Apollo lunar modules and moonwalkers and their exploration tools to the moon's dust and back to orbit."
2,The tie-string ones are better,"I live overseas so I can only get the insta-clip mantles here. The old tie-string style ones are longer, which give you a larger mantle and more light from the lantern."
3,Leuk voor wie de eerdere albums niet heeft,"ZOEgirl werd in 2000 gelanceerd als christelijke tegenhanger van tienerpopster Britney Spears. Inmiddels heeft het trio Alissa Childers, Chrissy Conway en Kristin Swinford 5 albums gemaakt en er een miljoen van verkocht, waarna Sparrow een best-of nodig vond. Naast 2 nieuwe songs One Day en Unchangeable (eerste radiosingle bij dit album), beiden onmiskenbaar ZOEgirl vind je 13 songs van 4 eerdere albums; het remix album Mix of Life bleef onberoerd en da's jammer bij bijvoorbeeld Even If en I Believe. De groei van danceable tienerpop naar issue pop met rauw rockrandje wordt door de ogenschijnlijk willekeurige volgorde teniet gedaan. Radio en videohits Beautiful Name, You Get Me, Dismissed, Feel Alright en About You ontbreken niet. Daarentegen ontbreken liedjes als Anything Is Possible en Living for You van hun debuutalbum. Ruim een uur ZOEgirl bijeen, leuk voor degene die eerdere albums niet heeft."
3,Only OK Quality,"I purchased 8 of the dinner plates and 8 of the salad plates for Thanksgiving. When I received them, 2 of the plates were chipped which Amazon immediately sent replacements (Amazon was wonderful) but almost every plate has a blemish. I do not think that these plates are first quality. The plates are not as pretty and colorful as is pictured here either.As to the origin of the plates as mentioned by some, mine are stamped that they are made in Colombia.I wanted turkey plates for Thanksgiving for a long time and was disappointed with these. If you can get them for a good buy then go for it but if not, I would look further.edited to add: These plates are small for a dinnerplate. For Thanksgiving we serve alot of different foods and these plates aren't really big enough to hold everything. We had to use the dinner and salad plates just to hold the different foods."
4,"Not a Miracle, but great tool","We have an 11 year old Border Collie who has always had issues with thunder and similar noise events but who has recently started being upset by the dishwasher and other causes. The vest certainly helps calm him, sometimes more than others. It isn't a miracle cure but it is certainly a great ""parenting"" tool. I would suggest not using the tail hole if you are not having good results, as it seems to make the wrap less effective with our dog."
2,Go with the Thundershirt Instead,"I bought a Thundershirt and an Anxiety Wrap for my two Airedales. While both products worked in helping to calm the dogs during a thunderstorm, the Thundershirt was much easier to use. Just place it on the back of the dog, then fasten the velcro straps. No problem at all.The Anxiety Wrap, however, was almost impossible to get on an already anxious dog. You have to place it over the dog's head, then pull the legs up through the leg holes, then fasten. I know it sounds easy and the video at their excellent web site makes it look easy, but it isn't, particularly with a dog that's worked up. Getting the Anxiety Wrap on stressed out the dog almost as much as the storm did!Both products worked, but the design of the Thundershirt is much more user-friendly. Having used both products, I strongly recommend Thundershirt over Anxiety Wrap."
2,Original Anxiety Wrap,This product didn't work for my dog. Problem was the dog would get very anxious when driving and getting close to destination. Would skreech and squill and bark. It didn't matter where we were going or if he had been there before or not. VERY loud.
1,Does not work,Recieved item and with some difficulty finally got it on my dog. I put in on him during normal weather as suggested. He just froze up. Would not come to me so took it off. It started to rain lightly a few days later so I put in on him. It did not help at all.A total waset of money.
3,The calming wrap medium size,The medium calming wrap is easy to put on and take off your dog. It seems to calm her a little when I go out. She does not seem as upset. The wraps for larger dogs seem easier and less stressful for the dog than the wraps for the small dogs.
3,Anxiety Wrap for dogs,"After I finally figured out just exactly how to fit the anxiety wrap on my dog, I found it did actually calm her somewhat. She becomes very anxious during thunder storms or fireworks. She still experienced a little anxiety, but was much more relaxed than I can ever remember her being during storms and fireworks. Last but not least, she actually enjoys having me put it on her."
2,Anxiety Wrap,"I bought this for my Border Collie who is petrified of thunder and fireworks. It seems to help somewhat, but I have a hard time putting it on correctly. Getting it through her front legs is a challenge for me. I'm giving up and buying the Thundershirt."
4,Item came on time,Received product on time no problems with the description nor use of the product satisfied customer and dog seems to like the item
4,Anxiety Wrap for Dogs,"We have only used it a couple of times but when we have used it, it does seem to calm our dog down (English setter)."
2,Returned,"Did not get the right size, thought this was the Thundershirt, but it was from a different company and was to complicated to put on a squirmy dog."
1,anxiety wrap did not work,it was more of a sweater than a wrap did not work for our dog and we returned it after putting it on 1 timeNot to say that it wont work for some it just did not work for us
2,does not work for iphone,"I got this item because it was advertised as being compatible for the iphone. IT ISNT! It works on my ipod just fine but thats not why I bought it, I needed a charger cable for my iphone in the car. Then, to add insult to injury, after I posted my seller review, the seller contacts me asking me to change my review, which states the item is not compatible with the iphone 4. In exchange for taking it down they will refund the shipping costs. Why should I take it down, so you can lie to other consumers? Don't think soGet this charger for your ipod but DO NOT GET FOR IPHONE 4."
4,Too fat for Elago stands,"Workmanship is good (as is with most Belkin products) and love the minimal OEM packaging. The clasp means that it is hard to pull out by mistake. But, it is fatter than a standard 30 pin connector, which means that it doesn't fit Elago P2 nor M2 stands. Probably doesn't fit some cases. My solution was to get out the Dremel tool and grind it down. Worked somewhat, but not great - won't fit through the cable guide hole on the back of the stands. So, am ordering a few ""2 x 3Ft BLACK USB Charging Cable"" instead."
3,Nice gloves but they break,"It really is quite easy to rip these gloves while putting them on or fittiting the finger tips. Otherwise they are quite nice gloves, just make sure your hands are not moist (like after washing and drying them) at all and take your time while putting them on."
2,Snipe away.,"Would be nice if almost every positive review on here wasn't secretly written by some TVTemployee or ""street teamer"" - but I've seen this band twice and listened to theirCD and it's just not very good. They have an alright ""sound"" but that doesn't translate into songs."
2,dunno what all the fuss is about,Being from the UK myself I've heard a lot of brit pop type stuff and yeah this does sound like that but not particularly good.I'm not saying there's a bad track on here but I reckon you need to be a pretty dull person to get excited about the songs as nothing really happens here.Seems to me all these 5 star ratings are from people who like brit pop and have now suddenly found a band from their own country that make this kind of music and want to rave about it.They'll be lucky to make the top 20 over here.
1,Extremely poor support,It resets intermittently and I can't copy more than half a gig without it aborting. I've sent 4 emails to their tech support and still haven't received a response. I would not buy an Argosy product again.
4,"Cute, not a ton of light","If you are buying these because they're adorable in the day as well as the evening, do it....If you're buying them for the light they put out, you may want to keep looking. We love them in our garden - they look so pretty during the day and magical at night, but they do face completely down, so there isn't a lot of light, except directly under them...Exactly what we wanted, though - May get 4 more! (Very easy to install, too!)"
4,hugely important,"Superman is a little straight laced for me (I don't read much DC, I'm more of a Marvel guy), I'm more of a Batman guy. But I do like some Superman stories, and this one is an important storyline in an important book/hero (and whether you like him or not, he is important in the pantheon). This is a great idea, a great concept. But they didn't pull it together enough. Half the problem though is that there are four different writers (in seven different books covering five different series). A single writer would have pulled it together better. And there was nothing to Doomsday. He just woke up and started destroying things for no rhyme or reason, though I understand that in a different book DC goes in to it. The final book though, with its full page illustrations was quite a visual feast."
5,Couln'd Stop reading it.....,"I have always been a Superman fan. However, I have never sat and read one of his comic books. I decided to learn how was it that Superman died, so I bought this book. It was so good that I could not stop reading it. If you want my advise buy it, but do not stop there; buy the whole collection a the same time: ""The Death of Superman"", ""World Without a Superman"", and "" The Return of Superman"". That way you do not have to wait desperately for the other two to arrive."
1,Just one long punch-up,"The Death of Superman. By all rights, it should be one of the biggest and best events in comic history. Unfortunately, it's absolute rubbish, nothing but a protracted fight between Superman and some monster who has no background story, no personality, no motivation, and not even any interesting powers beyond being very, very strong. Each issue is the same; Superman chases down Doomsday on his path of pointless destruction, they exchange a few blows, and Doomsday jumps away, moving one step closer to the big showdown in Metropolis. Along the way, Superman says how tired he is and marvels at how strong Doomsday seems. Think I'm ruining the plot? There isn't a plot to ruin! Just awful. To see how to properly destroy a superhero, check out Knightfall, Bane vs Batman."
2,Not a good value,"Mr. Ohrtman spends much of the book to argue his case for VOIP rather than discussions of how it works and how it interfaces with the PSTN. The technical discussions, especially for the local loop alternatives, were very basic and not of much value."
1,Lost Cause Propaganda,"Like the other reviewers, after reading this hatchet job on Longstreet, I felt the need to get on Amazon and let Civil War enthusiasts know this is not a responsible piece of historical writing. I cannot understand how somone with a PhD can write such innacurate and partisan nonsense, and that publisher picked it up! Don't waste your time on this book."
5,Almost every hit...,"This is a great collection of singles for any Mac Davis fan. Within this set is every single released from 1970 - 1980 plus some great extras. The only songs missing are ""Secrets"" and ""Rodeo Clown"" then I would concsider it the essential collection. If you want the complete Mac collection, follow this up with ""The Very Best And More"". Its great to play a lot of the forgotten song from this master singer songwriter, enjoy :-)"
1,looks good but...............,"512MB Slim MP3 Video Playergot this mp3 player as a gift,and loved the design of it.the instructions were easy enough until it came down to downloading or syncing music to the device,it will not do it.i tried for hours last night to get music on this thing and it just will not go on.i bought everyone in my home mp3 players for christmas and we are all enjoying our music,different brand of course.but this device will not function right at all.i will not reccomend it at all.the only thing it is good for is the radio,can not even load photos."
3,Is Pluralism wrong? Or just not an historic view of choice.,"It seems funny that we ask our children to improve in school, to get A's. Employers ask of their employees to be the best. To be perfect? Hum. Why? For what? So we can fail again. Is there no growth to the point of perfection. James R. White downplays a very fundimental belief of the LDS, that with centuries of time and tests of our inner spirit we can become as god. Perfect. Is not that what God wants of us? Is that our reward? Or are we never able to attain perfection? Restoring a church, which Jesus Christ and God himself founded at Christ's birth, was this not revelation. Revelation is fundimental to all mankind. Who are you to tell anyone that their relationship with the Holy Spirit is not revelation. Who are you to tell anyone that a church restored in Jesus Christ's name is not Christian. That it is a Cult. How easy it is to be that perfect."
3,Good,"The movie was not as good, well acted or as erotic as I remembered from years ago. It was good, but not very good or great."
5,Very good read!,I am a pastor of a 200 member church and there were many things that i agreed with about this book. Loved how it encouraged you to continue on as well as offering insights on how to serve better. Made me laugh many times as it is amazing how people do say and do things that are so predictable. People almost believe that if they continue doing things the same way every week that more people will come and ministry will get more healthy. Numbers of peopl will never be something we should worry about. We need to minister to whoever shows up. If we are blessed with a tiny church great! If you have a bigger church... great too! Good read for sure!
1,What a drippy coffeemaker,"This is the worst coffeemaker I have ever owned. And I've been drinking coffee for 25 years. First off, if you like your coffee stronger and add more grounds than most coffee drinkers do, then beware. When the water drips in, the grounds float out of the filter/holder area, and end up in the coffee, and all over the coffeemaker. It doesn't seem to drip right, and the grounds get redirected wherever. And no matter how I make it, more grounds less grounds, it tastes horrible! Flat and bitter and oily. My last coffeemaker was great, but it died. Mr. Coffee in the thermal carafe. I purchased this B&D on a clearance and I think I know why. I'm returning it tomorrow to get my money back. Cheaper is not always better."
1,Never managed to read the book up to now,"I bought this book because I wanted to get technical details about how billing is done and instead of that I got, from the very first chapter to the last, some sort of repetititive management and regulatory check-lists.The book seems to have been written for contemplative bosses completely disconnected from operations and who need to build powerpoint slides to tell what his team is up to.For technical folks who are in the telecoms industry, the book by its academic and disconnected approach is surely a boring read. For a software shop like ours, needing to build billing support tools, this book is up to now completely useless."
2,Hard drive had bad sectors,"I bought this laptop to replace my Toshiba laptop of two years. It was very fast in the begining even though I had to uninstall a lot of software that came pre loaded. I have been using the laptop for three months now and it recently gave me a hardware malfunction. On running the vaio hardware diagnostic, I found that the hard drive has bad sectors. I sent the PC to sony to fix this issue and got it corrected in a day. VAIO is renowned for its build quality. This did come as a disappointment considering that I had paid extra for getting this configuration on a VAIO. Probably I was just unlucky to get a defective piece. But as they say once bitten, twice shy."
2,Not happy,"The laptop is ok but there are some big problems with it. Sony used to be the cream of the crop, what happened? I got this laptop because it was powerful and had lots of ram and because it was a Vaio. I have always wanted a Vaio because they are some of the best laptops ever built. I get the laptop and it has an external antennae that could break if you breath on it wrong. The battery is flimsy and poorly designed. And as usual, loaded with tons of crap software that I paid way too much for. Sony, this is a shout out, pull your heads out of your butt!! I am returning this computer because it does not live up to the Sony name of quality."
1,Another silly tourist's book,"This book is just another silly tourist's book by just another ignorant tourist. Not worthy of real travelers!Read Mary Lee Settle's ""Turkish Reflections"" to get a good introduction to Turkey. It is becoming a bit dated but is still much better than silly books like this."
4,An excellent collection,"While the volume on this CD doesn't seem quite right, this is nonetheless an excellent collection by one of the all-time greats. Those who love zydeco should buy it..."
1,Stinko recording volume,"The volume on this CD is lower than on any other I own. Clifton is great, but don't play this with others, you'll be constantly adjusting the volume.I twice wrote to Arloo the recording company - but they do not answer letters from unhappy customers.I would not buy this cd or any from this company."
4,Chicago Bears' Glass Ornament,"A clever and brightly colored Christmas Tree ornament produced through the National Football League, this one aimed at the Chicago Bears' fans. Attractive in a goofy sort of way, it adds a differing tone to the usual round globes seens everywhere."
3,"It's good, but not GREAT.","I was suprised by this CD. Unlike my other Dougie MacLean CDs i only really liked aboot less than half. Those that did appeal to me were incredible though. The inclusion of Bagpipes in ""Eternally You"" left me absolutely speachless and craving more. ""Strathmore"", ""Into the Flames"", and ""Not Look Down"" were really good too."
2,Ah right,"Well these cartoons are more educational then superheroing, I can understand why they did it. They wanted cartoons to educate as well as entertain. I guess it could have been done better. Then again that;s what School House Rock was all about, but then again School House Rock had a better team of animators and recording artists to work on them. These cartoons look like they were done by people who could only draw what the low budget permitted."
1,Lousy fit,"The fit on this kit is ridiculous bad on my 97 Teg. I'm not sure what to think. The manual says its for 88-91 Tegs in some places and 88-01 Tegs in other places. It definitely doesn't fit well. It doesn't have a bracket to mount where the OEM radio was mounted, and it doesn't fit snugly in the double-din slot. The top and bottom guides are bowed inward, the face plate bows outward, and after a few days the whole thing slides back out of the slot about a half inch on each side and I have to push it back in.While I'm complaining, I should also add the the installation manual is absurdly brief.I guess its probably better than nothing -- but not much better. I'm going to try to find a kit from another dealer. But until I do I have no choice but to keep using this one."
3,A high level overview of the marque,"The author uses a ""star rating"" system on the possible collector value of the varied VW models since the Beetle's creation. While useful at high level, the book glosses over some of the details between model years, such as why the 1967 Beetle is sought after by folks who plan on driving 'em rather than collecting dust in the garage. Some more detail on what makes some models more desired by collectors and hobbyists would be welcome. For the beginning VW nut, this book ought to be in the collection, but the hard core VW fan, spend your money elsewhere as you know most of what is in here. Good, clear phots for the most part and the editing of the text decent."
2,A general overview of VWs but not a detailed buyers guide,I bought this book for getting detailed info about vintage VWs before I tried to buy one. I disappointed after reading it because I had learned all knowledge available in this book from the World Wide Web before.This book is only for getting general information about historical background of VW cars.
1,"Terrible product, do not buy!",Making the powerballs was fun. Once they dried (about 1 day) they transformed into rocks. They are not bouncy by any stretch of the imagination. I would highly recommend NOT buying this product.
5,"A ""must "" for anyone wanting to understand art","Robert Motherwell describes us on an intimate tone his journey, and that of his comrads, in their quest for expressing ""the human soul"". Motherwell explains us here in his own words, about the abstract expressionism movement to which he was a protagonist, and how it was about ""what one feels"" being more important than ""what one thinks"". Moving, with intelligent narration."
2,Content = 5 stars Quality of book itself = 2 stars,"Yes, this book is very helpful with developing design skills. The only thing I was unhappy with when I recieved it in the mail was that on the preview of it on this website Amazon.com it looks as though it would be in color...only when it came it looked like it was xeroxed (and a bad job at that) it was obviously printed in color to begin with but has since been printed in black, gray & white. For instance, it goes to describe a color scale but the ""color"" scale is gray & black. It also has a section about highlights & skin color yet alas, it is gray & black...Very helpful but at the same time very disappointing..."
3,works great!,"We have an Intex rectangular above-ground pool. When I was looking for a fountain, I knew I would need one that was ""universal"". Many pool fountains and accessories are for a specific pipe thread size (ususally whatever in-ground pools have). So the reason I bought this unit is because they claim it comes with any connectors you need. NOT TRUE. We were only able to make the fountain work using extra parts WE had prior to purchase. Otherwise, we would have had to send this back.Installation issues aside, it works very well. It reduced pool temperature by about 5 degrees, which was the reason for our purchasing it. I worried that the holes might clog with debris, but that hasn't been a problem. And you can tell when your filter needs changing/cleaning by the water level of the fountain."
5,Works and Looks as Advertised,Makes a great looking fountain for our pool. Surprised how great it looks in the pool with the lights on at night. Inexpe.nsive too
3,"Not bad, but VERY outdated!","I ran into this book while looking for the best thing out there in terms of Web Design. Well, this book is just 4 years too old, unfortunately. Some of the examples, yes, they made sense... but they lack some of the elements that have come to the forefront of the field in the past few years. I was amazed that it was still in the shelves, in fact! If you want an EXCELLENT and current (as of this writing) book on the topic, get yourself a copy of ""Web Redesign: Workflow That Works"" by Kelly Goto, Emily Cotler. You'll be happy if you do!"
2,This Book Is Not Good,"I do not understand the reason they chose to tie the title to web design only, since the book addresses CD-Rom and multimedia projects also. Furthermore, this book is too simplistic to be really helpful. I read the first half and only scanned the rest of it. With all the good materials on web design, I could not afford to waste my time on this one. The pictures of web home pages disseminated here and there are the only good thing about this text. They are good looking and can help generate some ideas; plus, they are in full color."
4,"YES, web design and MORE!","I've used this book for two years as a text and inspirational idea book in my web design class. The best thing about the book is that it speaks to the ""process"" of web design as well as design basics, covering all the bases in marketing and publishing and also addresses portfolio and self-promotion. Frankly, there is far too much in the book for one course but I find that each student finds something unique to their way of working that helps them produce better images and design. However, after two years I was hoping for a second edition to cover new technology available to the web designer.If you want to know about the how and why of web design, this is a excellent book. It is not just a ""picture"" book but a learning guide. I highly recommend it."
1,Lamest design book I've ever seen,"I was required to buy this pointless little book for a college class I took several years ago and I still regret wasting money on it. It had no substance whatsoever. Every once in a while I'd see a nice little blurb about information architecture or page layout, but it was 99% fluff. Everyone stoped bringing it to class after the second week, because the only times it was useful were those rare occasions when we had designers block and needed to jack someone else's full-color idea.Now I am the kind of person who likes to horde all kinds of books, but I sold The Web Design Wow Book at the campus bookstore (only got a couple bucks for it because, surprise, it was never used in any other classes) because I was embarrassed to have it on my shelf.People learning how to design interfaces or looking for inspiration would be much better off with something like Web Pages That Suck or Edward Tufte's Envisioning Information."
5,great tasting lentils,"The Golden Lentils have a mild taste. They are much better tasting than the brown lentils. I cooked them with chicken broth. I used celery, carrrots cut into match sticks in addition to sweet onions. It made a great meal with cornbread."
4,Very easy and fast to cook,Love these. Don't taste as good as the brown lentils but it cooks faster and can be made into other foods
1,I Lost IQ Points by Reading This Book,"""Charmed"" is probably the sorriest excuse for a novel I have ever read. I liked Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"", so the time-travel-meets-romance formula is not the problem. ""Charmed"" is poorly written, badly concieved, not true to history, not consistent (the magic Indian can turn the bedroom into a romantic glade with flowers and butterflies but he can't heal his wife's sprained ankle) and the dialog is painfully stupid. Example: Nikki has traveled back in time to the Shawnee tribal lands and is attending a festival with Silver Thorn. He has painted his body with blue paint for the ceremony and she says ""Omigod! You look like a cross between a Mighty Power Ranger and a giant Smurf!"" In spite of the fact that she speaks in modern slang, the Indians of 1812 have no problem accepting her. They like her Bic lighter!! A total waste of time - you will lose brain cells as you read."
2,Disappointment,One would think that this dvd would also INCLUDE more input from the boys themselves. It would make better sense to incorporate what they feel they are lacking by not having a father or an active POSITIVE MALE role in their lives. It would be informational to hear what they would like help in understanding. Overall it is lacking depth.
1,Fly Away to Dragon Land (Dragon Tales),"Adorable pictures, but very ""weak"" in the open the flap area! Not surprising, kids a bit disappointed! Pictures under flaps need more imagination! Boring."
5,AWESOME,THIS BOOK IS REALLY GREAT. THEY REALLY KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE. THIS BOOK OFFERS REAL SITUATIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.
1,"Not a Book, Just a Microsoft Advertisement","If you want to pay for a Microsoft advertisement, then this book is for you. Otherwise, choose a money book written by someone who isn't shilling for a company."
1,Don't Bother....,"I seriously enjoyed the movie ""Willow""; this book and the other two in the series ""Shadow Dawn"" and ""Shadow Star"" supposedly continue Willow's story. I've wanted to read these books for a while, because the movie *sorta* left me with a question or two. All this series did was CONFUSE me. I'm an avid fantasy reader, so it's not like these are out of my genre, but the way the books are written, the ""explanation"" of how the ""magic"" works, even the events in the book, are so boring and confusing that after I forced my way through this book I had no desire to read the second. It took me a year and major desperation for something to read before I picked up #2. Two and a half years after I forced my way through 2, I finally read 3. Wasted time. I enjoyed the side panel of my cereal box more than this series. There was serious potential after the awesome movie, but they missed the mark by a mile with this series."
4,I liked this book although it was sometimes hard to follow.,"I enjoyed Shadow Moon, although it was rather hard to follow in some places. I was disipointed to find that two of my favorite characters from the movie Willow had died before the end of the prolouge. Compared to the mvie this book was rather dismal though it has a bit of rye humor in places. It's a good book, it's just not light reading."
2,Claremont & Lucas continue the Willow saga,"Willow is Drumheller after the first couple chapters -- and we come to discover that those two obnoxious brownies are still at his side as he finds himself in a new mission -- to save adorable Elora Danaan from herself.The cute baby has grown up to be the Brat Queen of the world, and Willow's only chance of saving her is to team up with as unlikely a band of people as saved her the first time; only Will--er, Drumheller is a more powerful sorcerer than he once was. Not only that, but he must give himself to a dark force in order to accomplish it, endangering his alliances and, it would appear, his very soul.What ensues is a predictably long and drawn-out trip to rescue Elora the Brat from her castle, protect a forest, save a few lives and generally stop evil from triumphing. Typical. Less than I'd expect from the minds behind Star Wars and the X-Men.The ending is abrupt and jarring, but crafted well enough to make one curious about the next volume"
3,True Diana Palmer fans will enjoy,"Let me start the review out by saying I am a huge Diana Palmer fan. I started out reading her romances and was hooked. I have to say though that lately her books are becoming stale, this one included. This book is part of a line of books, of which the first of the Hart's stories was EXCELLENT. Diana's characters are becoming cliches, all the women are the same, the men as well. Her personal beliefs are coming through too much as well, such as her political feelings. This book is more of the same. Her loyal fans will love it, but it will leave many readers looking for more."
4,Man of means,"A good read. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good romance, since I'm a huge Diana Palmer fan!"
1,"A ""cheap"" collection, definitely not essential.","This collection appears to be of whatever songs could be licensed for the least possible amount of money. The first 14 on disc 1 are very early tracks, recorded well before the first Sir Douglas Quintet album was ever released. They are somewhat of interest for historical value, but nothing close to the level of music Sahm would later achieve. The next 11 are the entire ""Hell Of A spell"" album from 1980 which was Sahms pure ""blues"" release. A good album by itself, but representative of only one facet of his music. Disc 2 is again tracks mostly from 1965/66, from the first Sir Douglas Quintet album and related sessions.For a good collection of the music that made Doug Sahm a legend, try instead ""The Best Of Doug Sahm & the Sir Douglas Quintet 1968-1975"""
5,Entertaining & Informative,This Triangle endorses this book (and video too) as they most certainly help to isolate an enhanced yet simplistic approach to understanding and communicating with anyone in seconds flat. Too bad it's not available on Dvd.
4,Good Book for first ADSI programming,This book is excellent for programmer who want to admin nt server by most easy way. Step by step way is good to understand ADSI but there are some loose of base line of ADSI what it is.
5,community ... 3rd season,Community 3rd season continues its journey of these favorite characters life and adventures at Greendale. Truely enjoyable and a fun filled time continues in this 3rd season edition.
5,Another Awesome Season!,"Been waiting since the last season ended to own this, now I can delete the episodes off my pvr. Fantastic, original and hilarious! As phenomenal as the second season, can't wait until the fourth starts!!"
4,"Great quality, iffy packaging","When I first received this box set I was concerned that I got a bootleg copy of the discs because the packaging seemed so flimsy. I tested all of the DVDs and everything runs well and is obviously from credible sources, so maybe this season the packaging just got a little cheap? In any case, despite the one DVD clip being broken, everything works well, which for the price, is all that matters!"
1,something is wrong,"I have read at least ten books by this author. If I had not seen his name on the cover, I would not have suspected that he was the author. The material in the book is what he would believe, but the writing style is completely different. This is because the executors of the literary estate wrote his sermon notes into a complete book. The executors do not have a track record of being successful authors. Unfortunately, the book reads more like a Sunday school lesson for grammar school children than a book for intelligent adults. It is completely touchy-feely hand waving verbosity with a total lack of the usual compact, intelligent, logical form characteristic of the author."
5,A History of the English-Speaking Peoples--Winston Churchill,"This item arrived from the vender early. The books are in very good condition as advertized. Churchill had reasons for writting these books.From National Review Online (NRO): ""Socialism begins with the material world (the redistribution of pre-existing things); capitalism begins with ideas and dreams (the creation of things)."" Fr. Robert A. Sirico"
5,Nuthin But Da Blues,"This is a must have for any blues lover, to see B.B. in his younger years when he still played his own licks is unbelieveable."
2,Disappointing,"I recently ""discovered"" Kat Colorado and for the first few books was impressed, but this one is sadly lacking. A little too predictable, and badly damaged by the author's misinformation about the Mormon Church. She recycles every silly myth published in the dime-novel dreadfuls of the 1880s and leaves one wondering if she's ever met any real live Latter-day Saints. Sad, considering that in plot context, she could have invented a fictional cult instead of maligning a major Christian church with 5 million members in the US and Canada alone.One of the things that drew me to Kat was her sense of ethics. Many Mormons might agree with this and like the character, until this book, where her anti-religious bigotry shows in unfounded accusations of bigotry against religion (she continues this unfortunate development in ""Stray Kat Waltz"").Too bad. A major loss to the underpopulated woman detective genre."
3,Pretty pictures,"I like this organizer calendar, but I wish that the overall design would be a bit more appealing. The spaces for appointemnts are not large enough and the light cream background is boring at best. Still, it keeps a family of four on track."
2,You can do better,"I am a videographer who is expanding to provide custom covers to my DVD creations. These are NOT of high quality. If you want to catalog your families trips or store something, they'll be fine, but really, they are pretty cheap. You have to download the software, which is a bad deal for those with dial up. They'll work, but I'll buy higher quality next time."
3,Not Horrible,"These are good for kids, not so much with adults. They are kind of awkward and dont really help you play at all. Again, great for kids though."
2,Both Charleston and history deserve better,"Mr. Rosen, who passes himself off as a native Charlestonian (after a mere three generations) should stick to practicing law. The book is attractive enough, almost indistinguishable from the Time-Life books that could be its template. It is, unfortunately a politically correct, polemical treatise on Charleston as the cradle of slavery. In lawyerly fashion, facts are cherry-picked, amplified or ignored to drive home the point. Nullification is predictably underplayed. Is this another indoctrinated Southerner who feels he must 'dance naked before his sins' in order the tell his story or does he really believe this stuff? I'm keeping it for the illustrations, otherwise it would be the first book I have ever returned. What a terrible disappointment. I have been to this great city many times, and my own family spilled blood in her defense at Battery Wagner in 1863. The story of Confederate Charleston deserves a far better story-teller than this!"
5,Western Digital WD1600AAJB,"This was ordered to replace an old small (30GB) hard drive, to set up a dual-boot for Windows 2000 / Linux. The drive worked fine, no problems."
4,Works well but makes an occasional noise.,This Western Digital Cavair Blue internal hard drive operates well but makes a bit more noise than the original drive that was in my Dell desktop. The installation was easy and with the free drive cloning software that's available on the Internet I finished the install in one hour. The noise is not a real problem and is only heard occasionally. It's a good buy for the price and I plan on buying another to upgrade my laptop.
1,Died After 14 Months of Infrequent Use,"I bought this drive as a replacement for a small capacity drive in one of my Windows XP machines. I went through a lot of effort to reflash the BIOS in the computer to allow a drive of this size to work properly on the machine. Once this was done, the Acronis software worked great to transfer the information over to the new drive. All looked really good until after 14 months of relatively infrequent use it suddently dies with no warning. Now I'm back to using my old drive an I very much doubt I'll bother to buy another replacement."
2,Slow Shipping (Free Shipping),"Order this item 3 days ago and just now getting shipping confirmation. Expected delivery date posted as 7 days from now. Being shipped USPD. No indication of where the product is coming from. NOT impressive. Before starting this review and not having even seen the product, I decided two give it a product rating of three stars. Changed my mind and went back to lower its rating to 2 stars.Western Digital makes good product and I expect the drive will work fine for years. But, no matter how good the product is, this experience with Amazon has left a bad impression.This is only the second time I have done business with Amazon, but I expect it is the last."
4,Pleased,"The an is very quiet and moves enough to clear the room of all problems, is made of good quality and should last."
3,Drafty,"I purchased this as an exhaust fan for my garage. It's great for that purpose (continuous run, quiet, and can be thermostat-controlled) and seems to be very well-made. However, I won't buy additional for use as bath fans, because every time the wind kicks up, the damper, which is light as a feather, opens wide. I suppose this may be a common issue with through-wall fans. The other issue I would note is that it's not a great design if you are going to put it in the middle of a circuit and against a stud with the electrical box on the stud side. Maybe would have worked better with smaller 3/8"" conduit. Just wouldn't fit with 1/2"" Al conduit. The fan can be mounted upside down if your stud spacing is tight and won't accommodate wires in conduit running around the fan duct, which is 8.25"" in diameter."
4,You gotta hear Mike Slamer!,What an awesome guitarist! Mike Slamer has it all. He plays awesome riffs and melodic solos and adds in the fireworks too! He also writes and produces everything just like other comparable all-encompasing musicians like Nuno Bettencourt and Tommy Denander. This CD is very melodic and has it all from heavy rockers to huge power ballads. The vocals are very strong too and the production is excellent - loud and polished! Great guitars and powerful vocals are always a recipe for a great album and this definitely hits the mark. Highly recommended to fans of the melodic rock genre.
4,This is a tape of two episodes of Gilligan's island,"This two episode set contains the first episode of Gilligan's Island the first episode is titled Two on a Raft and involves the castaways trying to get of the island. The Professor tells the Skipper and Gilligan to watch out for headhunters on nearby islands. The bumbling crew set out, but a shark attack and a sudden storm cause them to land on an island(the same one they left)! remembering what the Professor told them, the Skipper and Gilligan think the other castaways are headhunters, and vice versa. The second episode involves the castaways trying to build a hut on the island. They do, but they all get on each others nerves so they decide to build individual huts however a set of minor disasters(Gilligan), causes the destruction of the huts. the castaways all have to try to build one major hut before a hurricane hits. END"
4,COLORIZED,"Excellent episodes, but they've been colorized. I was so surprised to see these episodes in color (I didn't even have a color TV when I saw these the first time). It was quite disconcerting to see these episodes in color. Also, they seem to have been edited: the skipper doesn't ever hit Gilligan with his hat (or maybe he started doing that in later episodes?)....I would have given it 5 stars if it had been in B&W (original format)."
4,Not enought Bob,"Paperback/Urban Fantasy: After some slow books in this series, the past two have been great. Like usual, the plot delves into several areas of Harry's world. I really liked the mystery, but I wasn't too crazy about the Fairy Politics. It was a little long, but I really enjoyed it."
5,"Proven Guilty, The Dresden Files Book 8","As always, a great read and makes me want to read the next one right now!"
5,One of the best!!,"Several years ago I logged on to a web site and the web-master was raving about a book a friend of his was about to have published. It sounded interesting so I stayed on the look-out for book one of the Dresden Files. I am SO glad that I did!This has been one of the most rewarding series I have ever read. The characters are fresh and well developed, the story line is interesting, and the books are very well written. Proven Guilty is no exception and may be the best of the series to date. Jim Butcher is a talented writer and a captivating story teller. You won't be disappointed.Buy this book! If you are new to the series, the books stand independently enough to ensure you will not be lost, but I would be willing to bet that you will rush to find the preceding stories.Keep on writing Jim Butcher! The view from Harry's world is too interesting to miss.- A long time fan."
1,Don't Bother Buying This Book,"While I would love to find a great book on advanced backup and recovery techniques for SQL Server 7, this is not the book. This book is far to general and full of fluff to provide the information you really need. It many ways, the book tries to cover a little of everything about being a SQL Server DBA, but it ends up doing a poor job of covering any topic.I was hoping to find advanced information on log shipping and clustering. While these topics are touched on, they don't provide you the information you really need.If you need a book on the basics of SQL Server 7 backup, most any book covering basic SQL Server 7 DBA responsibilities should fit the bill. This book is a waste of your time."
5,Beautiful work from Hishashi.,"I'm not sure why the Amazon listing omits the clearly labeled English translations, but this is a gorgeous soundtrack with a lot more depth than anything with the exception of Spirited Away. Look for a lot of more subtle moments, particulary the stunningly beautiful ""The Boy Who Accepted The Star"" with its stately, almost sad flow of a single horn and strings swelling to soft moments of sheer beauty.Highly recommended."
4,So sweet.,I really liked this one. The characters were very human and I felt that I knew them. They were honest and real and sweet. It was a quick read and it makes you cry and feel good about life and love at the same time.
1,Very difficult workbook,"I studied German for 2 years in highschool and spent 3 months in Northern Germany where I spoke Deutsch every day! Yet, I find this book confusing and difficult. I wish I had never purchased this book. It has been a frustrating waste of money."
1,Rip-Off,"I can't think of anyway to describe this except rip-off. First, it's not a book with only 20 pages: it's a pamphlet. Second, it does not contain 20 pages of information-much of it repeats and is useless for either drilling a well or building a well drill.Whatever your needs or hopes, this cheap homemade handout will not help. The author obviously does not know what he is talking about."
2,EH.,"There was no real detailed description of anybody or anything. I prefer more explicitness, making it easier to envision the characters and their surroundings that the author had in mind. Some might refer to that type of prose as wordy and cumbersome, but I prefer to think of it as painting a picture or portrait for me, the reader. Other reviewers have commented that the story moves swiftly; and it does because many of the sentences are not very long, the writing style reminding me of my 9 year old daughter's. Many of the dialogue scenes sounded as melodramatic as a poorly written soap opera. I waivered between giving it 3 stars or 2; I give a book 3 stars if I think it's an average good read. This story is basically good, and I really liked the ending epilogue; but I decided on 2 stars because the vampire Victoria becoming a Mother Theresa-like goody two shoes building an orphange for abandoned kiddies, complete with a chapel and an organ, bugged me."
3,"Great musicianship, but...",I'd hoped to get a little more of the flavor of West Side Story and there's really very little of it.
4,"Great ball, but","We play on a B1 league outdoors and in and bought this ball for our court at home. Played probably 10 to 20 games with the ball. Now I seen that the seam was starting to tear out. Everyone like how the ball feels and plays. the tear might have been from the one time someone kicked it this weekend. Shoe on full blown soccer kick, i was not too happy with that person. Ball has a soft shell, when we played on a field with very rough grass/dead weeds the ball would pick up little bits of hard sticks."
3,You're right; no Opening theme. But I know where to find it!,"The opening is actually called ""Sakasama no Cho"" lit. The Inverted Butterfly. It's performed by SNoW. But the lit. meaning has not been offical so it will be found by it's Japanese name. This CD does not contain any themes, only BGM. To find the OP Theme, you'll have to buy the original Artist's CD that has that track.I've listened to this CD from a friends house and decided to post this for help. It sounds as if the music has been polished slighty and it's great for relaxing to. It's worth getting if you want the BMG."
4,"Nice, tight movie","An outrageous (true) story, fully captivating from beginning to end. A masterfully crafted film, with several laugh-out-loud moments. Every acting performance is just perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hardly ever write movie reviews, but this movie deserves the praise, since it's kind of a ""sleeper."""
5,Amazing!,This move goes into the underbelly of Washington. Oh. Feel like you've seen something like that before? Not in such a fun (funnily scary) way. The whole cast works perfectly in this wild DC tale.
4,Pretty good movie on a topic that affects all of us.,"This movies give a good insight on how Washington lobbyists work. The movie makes evident the shortcomings of a capitalist democracy where more often than not, money fuels the outcomes of elections. Kevin Spacey is excellent as usual. I give this movie 4 stars as overall, the movie is great but the mechanics of how lobbyists influence government could have been explored a bit more in depth."
1,IP_WHAT???,Bottom line. It did absolutely nothing for me except spend my money. I took it til the bottle finished. Sometimes I think alot of these formulas are hype. Just sayin'
3,Average Controller.,"I used this Gamester Phoenix controller for a week and then got rid of it. The shape of the two ""handles"" make for painful knuckles after an hour. The whole controller ""kricks and kreeks"", making it seem like it was always on the verge of snapping in two. The analog sticks did not seem as sensitive as the Microsoft Controller S. The Phoenix seems to be average for an aftermarket controller, but I recommend that you spend the extra bucks and get only the stock Microsoft Controller S. It is not of higher cost for no reason. It is built better than most aftermarket controllers."
1,What are these other reviews?,"This controller is terrible. The only positive thing I could say about this controller is you can throw it at the wall and it won't break. The sticks are hard to move and don't allow for the pressure sensitivity required for enjoyable gaming. The buttons are stiff. The handles are big and uncomfortable. The included headset is uncomfortable to a grown adult. I didn't use the included headset after the first night. Overall, I would say move on to the next after market controller."
3,Review without Reading!,"I heard an interview with R. Schickel on Public Radio and am quite interested in buying and reading his book. I grew up in the same Wisconsin suburb - Wauwatosa, WI and most likely the same time period that he did and am interested in his depiction of that time and place. I'm most interested in how he covers the question of Hollywood not dealing with the WW2 persecution of European Jews. Subject matter which was not publically known in the US until about March 1945, two months before the end of that war.I rated this 3 stars because I couldn't submit a review without it."
2,Anna By Anyone But Anna,"Anna's efforts are noted. I mean, she puts a lot of hard work into this solo album of hers. But, while her songs are undeniably catchy, nearly all of them leave you wondering, ""Haven't I heard this song before?"". There are traces, if not replicas, of indie-rock women (and even some men) everywhere. It just gets old. Fast."
2,Disappointment of the year,"I was really excited to find out that after the five years since That Dog's Retreat From The Sun, I was finally going to get to hear some new music from Anna, presumably the main creative force behind the group, but even the better half of the songs on ""Anna"" don't come close to her former glory, and the other half are just plain bad.I really wish I had something more positive to say about this album, because I really did want, and expect, to like it, but I'm sorry, it just [is bad]."
3,Alternative to Topsy Turvy...,I was curious about the Topsy Turvy and went to check it out at my local Walmart but I found they didn't carry it. So I improvised and bought a hanging plastic pot and cut a hole in the bottom about the size of a silver dollar. I bought a Cherry tomato plant and an Early girl tomato plant. I chose these because they are supposed to be good for container planting. In the bottom hole of the pot I put the Early girl plant and filled in with potting soil. I put the Cherry one on top and filled the rest of the way with potting soil. I have had this hanging on my front porch for a little over a week now and it seems to be doing beautifully. I really can't comment on the Topsy Turvy but if this works out I'll probably purchase a few more pots.
2,you don't get much for your money,"You always wonder, from the tv ads, how they can afford to give you so much for such a low cost. But in fact, I had trouble telling from the ad what you would actually receive if you bought the topsy turvy. So I bought this one plus a different style. The other one from buzzy came with a basket, sphagnum moss, soil, and seeds. Thus far the seeds have sprouted and I have hopes of tomatoes sometime. With the topsy turvy, you get only a concertina-like basket. I have to buy my own soil, my own plants, etc. If it fails, I'm sure they will tell me that I bought the wrong soil, plants, etc. Maybe one of these will give better tomatoes than the other, but the buzzy has certainly been a better bargain in terms of the amount of stuff it includes. Much more entertaining to date."
1,topsy turvy no good tomatoes,"No one asked the tomatoes if they wanted to grow upside down! Plant spends all its energy flipping it leaves over and then - gravity be cursed - the plant grows up (of course) to the sunlight. Works so hard to right itself, no energy left to make tomatoes. My plants are growing up, over the top of the topsy turvy. Plant smart... purchase, not so much."
3,Woulda been nice....,"From what I've read, seen and heard, these work pretty well, and do what they are supposed to.Woulda been nice if I was able to get one to actually give it a review, but mine was back ordered, and never arrived. That's what I get for trying to get one at Christmas time for a gift.Hope you have better luck in getting one."
1,Not worth a cent,"I purchased 6 of these and they all fell apart about 2 months into the season. The plastic bags just began to split and tear, leaving gaping holes where the water washed out the potting soil, thus no way to water, and NO tomatoes. They ended up in complete tatters. I am considering hanging them out on my front lawn along our busy street to let all potential customers view the truth about the quality of this product. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. I wanted to rate it Zero stars but it wouldn't let me..."
1,Cheap crap.,"I bought this product because it is a good concept and it worked. But by the end of six months in the California sun, it disintegrated. One time use, I need a product that lasts and this is a waste of resources to buy a product that is not reusable."
1,Can I Leave 0 Stars?,"What a rip-off! I can not believe this thing is still for sale..It is not easy to start, and further more harder to keep up.I was looking for more current reviews-appears there are not as many suckers willing to waste hard earned money.As for me, I am happy that there are Tomato stands...."
2,Not as I had hoped for,Yes this is a great idea. The grew well from the time I transplanted the young plants.HOWEVER if you live in a hot weather climate do not get this product!! By june & july you must water these plants twice a day and due to the fact there is not much soil as they would have in the ground the tomatoes do NOT grow very big. I would not buy this product again!!!
1,Bought 3 but didn't get a single tomato,"I was so excited to grow tomatoes with the topsy turvey but it didn't work for me at all. My friend teased me that it was cheaper to buy tomatoes than to plant them this way. I was very careful to follow the directions, feeding, soil etc. Unfortunately I didn't get any tomatoes, just pitiful leggy plants, not even healthy looking ones. The water just dripped out the bottom and I think the plants sort of rotted."
4,I like the idea,Using gravity to grow food is an interesting concept and wanted to try this idea versus the traditional method of growing.
3,topsy turvy,"I like this product, It works well and is so easy to assemble, as long as the plants are still small."
1,poorly contructed,Before ever hangin the topsy turvy one of the three wire hangers came uncrimped. The wire ring at the top of the basket also was not crimped in place. very poor construction.
1,What a joke,"Planted tomato's in the topsy turvy and in a large pot using the same soil and the same plants and the plants in the pot produced 30 times more tomato's than the topsy turvy. DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!"
4,topsy turvy,"The product arrived on time and in good condition. We will see how well it produces in time. This is my first experience with this type of planter. Should it last more than a couple of seasons and produce fruit, then this purchase will have been worth it."
1,Awful Experience,"I bought this product and experienced horrible customer service. I made 4 phone calls to this company to change my order, and no one could help me. I plan to refuse the shipment, and return to sender my entire order."
1,Swivel *breaks* under weight,"I have been growing Celebrity Hybrids over the last month in the Topsy Turvey. All was well till today. To allow the topsy turney to rotate, the product has a built-in swivel. Well, it seems that this is the weak point in the product. The weight of the wet dirt bent what makes up this swivel causing my tomato plant and all the dirt crash down.I am now out of a maturing tomato plant and a few very mature herbs I had planted below it.So, yes the thing works, but the fact I didn't get to eat any tomatoes due to a hardware failure sort of lowers my rating slightly."
4,Love the Topsy Turvy Tomato Planter!,"I was a little skeptical that the upside down planter was worth the money! I love it. I bought a tomato plant, filled it with dirt and it's growing. I only filled it half way with dirt because other wise it would be way too heavy when you water the plant. I like the fact the excess water just drains out of it so you can't over water it. I have little yellow flowers on the plant so soon I hope to have tomatoes. Great idea!"
1,CHEAPLY MADE!,"The top to this thing doesn't even fit the way it is supposed to and please note that this thing is VERY heavy. It broke the hooks I had hung it on due to its weight, so if your considering this product have a real sturdy hook. Mine was supposed to hold up to 25lb so that's not enough. Also the water doesn't stay near the roots where it is needed it flows right out of the darn thing as soon as you poor it in."
2,Difficult to keep evenly moist,"We are disappointed in the results of our tomato crop that we tried to grow in this container. It was increasing difficult to keep moist, let alone evenly. We tried using a canvas bag, set up the same way as this product and were able to see better results. Our potted tomatoes did beautifully again this year, so it was not weather, location, heat, etc. that caused the problem. We don't have time to baby a tomato plant."
3,topsys,i bought 3 of thes thinking i would plant cucumbers in it but it didnt work the cukes died and i am trying to restart them
1,Fugedda boud it.....,"Absolutely USELESS...virtually impossible to keep an adequate water supply on the plant...showed wilting in less than 24 hours....no fruit; long vines; few leaves; my advice"" don't bother and don't WASTE your money! I wish there was a ZERO stars rating...I would have used it!"
3,This works after a fashion - some challenges,"We got these due to lack of gardening space and happily set them up with plants and soil, hoping for some great crops of tomatoes. The challenges began almost immediately as the foam spacer that holds the plants is not simple to install without 'decapitating' the plant.Here are the pros and cons:pros:- space saver- can grow other plants from the top while the tomoatoes grow from the bottom.- Can place just about anywhere you can hang it.Cons:- Getting the plants in the bottom can be quite challenging.- can become exceedingly heavy when full. - this makes moving a pain.- They don't hold up very well over time. Good for a year, maybe two - then have to replace.Overall it's a decent solution for space limited people. However, it's not a great deal more trouble to grow in a pot."
5,Let my Tomato's Grow!,"I have never used this set up before, but it's quite nifty, and we are hopeful for some crop this year."
1,waste of money,"I bought 3 tomato plants at the same time. One I planted in the topsy turvy, the other two in huge pots. I used the same soil and watered all equally. This was about 1 1/2 months ago. The topsy turvy plant has a few flowers, and one tinny tiny tomato developing. It is kind of yellow and sickly looking in some places. The other two plants, in huge pots, are huge, healthy, with tons of little tomatoes everywhere. Bottom line: you are much better off to grow your plants in huge pots (if you have limited place) and forget about the topsy turvy."
1,People Really Get This To Work?,"My mother brought home a Topsy Turvy and I rolled my eyes. We planted a Tomato as per directions with high hopes. The only tomatoes that grew were the two that were already on the plant when we bought it. The plant did horribly, the blooms died, and the tomatoes that grew were tiny. We have since taken the plant out of the Topsy Turvy and put it into a pot and it is now happy with several new tomatoes growing. There was no comparison to a plant of the same variety we planted in the ground near it. It grew healthy and tall with many blooms and tomatoes growing. I could not in good conscience recommend this product to anyone."
1,All dead . . .,"My parents have two of these and I have one. I think we followed the instructions and I know we kept them watered, but all the plants died. The leaves started turning brown, the necrosis worked it's way to the stems and they just shriveled up and died. Not sure what the problem was, but it didn't work for us."
2,good idea but more work needed,"We purchased six of these Topsy Turvy Tomato planters and used four for tomatoes and two for peppers. The material that they are made from degraded by the time Autumn came, after the produce stopped. They can't be used this summer, for sure. I wouldn't buy them again until they make their material/fabric stronger and more durable!"
2,Make your own!,"Expensive, heavy, and over board! Just use a market bag you can obtain at any grocery store or Trader Joes for .99 cents. The handles are sturdier and the bag expands. Slit bottom center with an X, slip seedling in, add soil mixed with vermiculite and peat moss and hang on a sturdy pole. If your soil mix has vermiculite and peat in it you will water less often. I would use a gallon jug with top cut off to water slowly on really hot days. The whole set up with soil, plant, and bag cost me $2.50 each."
1,Terrible!,"We planted 3 tomato plants and got 4 cherry tomatos from one of them. The planter itself completely disintergrated before the season was through. I won't even bother to plant the strawberries in the ""free"" hanging planter. This was a horrible investment. Also it needs to be watered very often. Certainly didn't work for us as advertised."
1,This is BAD,"I bought this with great expectations, and it ended up in the trash. My husband told me not to buy it and I should have listened. He planted his tomatoes in the ground, and I planted one in the Topsy. I followed all of the instructions exactly. His plants did beautifully. Mine did not fare well at all. I even tried moving it to different locations. I certainly would not recommend this product."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Don't even waste your money on this piece of crap! I followed the directions and my plants were doing well at first, then a few weeks went by after the plants started to grow they started to die. The leaves and stems turned yellow and died. There are very small green tomatoes on the plants now and I have a feeling they will never ripen. I usually have very large tomato plants every year, and this year I decided to give this contraption a try, worst mistake I ever made! As others have said the plants grow up towards the sun not down toward the ground. Wish I never spent money on this!"
4,"Comfy, took a bit to break in","I previously owned a pair of Uggs Short boots, which I refused to take off in the winter-they worked great as both boots and slippers. I discarded them after three years, as I was unaware that you could replace the interior footbed, and could not afford to replace them. I received these slippers last year as a gift, and was not initially thrilled, as the heel area was not comfortable and I experienced tightness at the top opening of the slipper. I wore them a couple of times, and after about two weeks, the fit improved. These slippers are warm and comfy and I have worn them out in dry weather while running errands. I highly recommend them."
5,Great Slipper,"Ugg is expensive but always worth the price. These are wonderful slippers in every way. Good support, great fit, warm, look great are just a few of the reason I love Uggs."
2,i got the wrong watch. Iam not happy,I got the wrong watch. It even said the right watch on the reciept. But not the watch i orderd.
4,Pretty good,I bought this for a friend of mine and she loved it. I listened to it and was pleased with the variety of music that it had.
3,Mixed Berry flavor is just okay,"I find Go-Mixes to be very satisfying for only 200 calories. First, they take longer to eat than most energy bars, which I like - who wants to be done in just four bites? Also, the balanced mix of protein, carbs, and fat tide me over for quite a while. These snacks even handle warm weather well - the yogurt raisins melt a bit but not a problem.The ""chocolate nut crunch"" and ""toffee crunch"" are outstanding - a sweet and salty combination. The ""berry"" blend isn't bad but has more of a ""healthy"" taste - the soy nut flavor take over.I'm concerned that they are discontinuing this product. That would be a shame."
4,A Winner!,"Works as advertised and, indeed, prevents lids from dipping into the inside of the can. Takes a little practice but it works fine, very happy with this one!"
5,Perfect! Works better than any previous safety lid removers I have had!,"The last safety lid remover I had was giving me too hard a time, as I had to go around the can several times before it would cut the lid. I decided to buy this Kuhn Rikon Auto Safety Lid Lifter after reading lots of reviews about a number of different lid lifters. Seems there are always people who have something negative to say about any product, so I found it hard to decide which one to buy. So despite one of the negative reviews about this product that I read in which the reviewer said this lid lifter was hard to turn, I bought it anyway. And I am glad I did because it turns so easily on the can that each time I use it, I still can't believe I got the lid off so easily. My old lid lifter was hard to turn from when it was new, so having this one being so easy was a surprise. And I like the little button that you push to have the gripper grab the lid and pull it off after it has been cut. So it is 5 stars for this lid lifter."
5,Great entry-level stethoscope,"I work as an EMT and this stethoscope is perfect for picking up heart tones, breath sounds, and blood pressures in noisy areas. The ear tips feel ultra comfortable and I have absolutely no problems in keeping them in my ears. Few stethoscopes can match the quality of this Littman at $42."
5,Good stethoscope,"I bought this stethoscope to use with my horses and when volunteering as a P&R person at endurance rides. It's comfortable and quite adequate for both purposes. I am a physician who is pretty particular about the equipment I use, even for horses!"
