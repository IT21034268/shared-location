2,Hot Dog Pop Up Toaster Review,"Overpriced, not worth more than $ 10.00takes too long to make a hot dogthe bun splits even though you put it in the slot in one piececant have anything other than a small, skinny hot dogcooks unevenly"
3,Hot dog maker,I bought this for my son who is going to be 10. Now he loves it thinks its the coolest thing in the world. But I have to say I am slightly disapointed The buns get very crispy and the hot dogs tend to be luke warm at best with the tip of it more on the cool side. We have found that putting the hot dogs in at the higher setting works best but dont put the buns in. But the 3rd setting is good if you dont want crispy buns. So basicly He uses the hot dog part and we dont use the bun part. Over all its ok. Great for someone my son's age who wants to feel more independant. For someone older of college level for dorms not recomended they could use a microwave.
1,PIECE OF CRAP,"Nostalgia Electrics - Pop-Up Hot Dog ToasterI purchase this Pop Up Hot Dog Toaster and ended up throwing it in the garbage. It will cook the hot dogs, but would get stuck, therefore, burning. Sometimes I had to dig them out due to the plumpness of the hot dog. Of course, they would tear all to pieces when trying to remove. I can't tell you how many times I tried putting the buns in the warmer and not popping up because of the tight area for the bun. When trying to remove the buns, they would tear up too. This device is not worth 2 cents."
4,No more nuked hot dogs!,"I got this item as a gift for my brother and his family because they eat hot dogs as if they were going out of style. They all love it, especially his kids. They can't get enough of it. They enjoy sitting there waiting for the dogs to pop up. They think its the best thing every. The toaster cooks the hot dogs evenly and they are juicier than cooking in the microwave."
5,excellent,This moisturizer has helped my toddler's skin. Her skin was very dry and I had tried everything. This did the trick. I would highly recommend this product.
2,Is it really raw?,"I question the statement on the label that this shea butter is raw and would not be surprised if it was processed. The color is more white than the other raw shea butter that I have used in the past, it is smoother, and although the scent is nice, it does not have that nutty shea butter scent. I emailed the company to ask questions about whether the product was really raw and they never returned an answer."
3,Way too wordy,This book has far too many dialog bubbles. It's frustrating to read aloud especially to a younger child (3-4yr). The cartoon is far better than the book.
2,Martha Speaks to Adults,"The story of Martha Dog's development into speaking family member amused my 5-year-old daughter, but the hand-written words emanating from Martha's mouth confused her. No wonder: they're not designed for the same audience. The story was created for young readers, while Martha's monologues and asides are intended for adults."
5,Book full of fun,"Though the CD is no longer with the book, the price was a good buy for a book that children love."
4,Best Shampoo I have used,I am a guy so I don't normally take the time to shop around for different hair care products. Usually its an all in one like Pert Plus. With other shampoos I have noticed 2 things. The first is that my dandruff went away when I stopped using a dandruff shampoo for 2 weeks. The second is that my hair is getting longer and the shampoo is ripping my hair out making it look fuzzy when they grow back in.As a guy I wanted a shampoo that won't rip my hair out. I also wanted a shampoo that didn't smell like lavender. This is one of the only shampoos I have found that fit that criteria.
3,Hmmm....,"I'm not really sure if this product works or not. I have been taking biotin along with using this shampoo and have noticed my hair is growing faster but it does not feel thicker at all. This product may help with new/extra hair growth, but it does not make it thicker. You would have to use it for months and months and wait for new hair growth to come through with your hair. I have noticed baby hairs that I did not have before so I'm hoping that is the new hair growth. This product would require patience. Also, it does not later that great and I find myself having to go in for a second dollop ."
4,Good story!,"I thought this was a very interesting story. I like the way the author describes things and the events that happen to Harry, he make things interesting without showing off using big words. Its interesting to read if you live in or around or travel to New York City. I read the book in 2 days because it was interesting enough that I didnt want to put it down."
1,The Problem with MFA Fiction...,"The titled character of TFK, Driscoll, tries the patience with his relentless self-pity, self-consciousness and exaggerated sense of self-importance. In otherwords, he's an adolescent. And a really dense one. The story is frighteningly shallow, superficial shilly shally non-sense borrowed from places we've been and authors we've read before. You're actually better off reading the Brothers Grimm original Frog Prince which is far more entertaining and has much more depth than this vanity project. This type of MFA fiction is precisely the reason I left writing school to become a translator with the UN. Honestly, write if you have something to say. Otherwise..."
3,up and coming artist!,"The lyrics and composition of this new artist reflect many of those most respected in the music industry; Neil Young, Steve Earle, Tom Waits, Woodie Guthrie, Springstein, etc. Mature beyond his age, Kasey Anderson, writes with clarity and heartfelt emotional strength. We are sure to hear more of this talented young artist. Buy it and share with your friends. You won't be disappointed!"
3,love the product hate that the spray spout gets clogged.... never had this happen on any other brand,"love the spray!!! Hate the spray spout... get's clogged after each use... I have to pull off the hardened hairspray and clean it off each and every time... Might switch just because I have never, ever had this happen with a hair spray can."
4,One Of The Better Hairsprays,"I would buy this product again. It is definitely one of the better products for thinning hair. It holds my hair better than any expensive salon product, and I have used them all."
4,great doll,I bought this doll for my 3 year old cousin for Christmas. She loves it! When I was a child I loved Strawberry Shortcake. I had been disappointed by the Strawberry Shortcake dolls till I bought this one. This doll reminded me of the dolls that I had when I was younger. Sometimes when these companies update these toys for the new generations they change them way too much. If you are looking for something that looks like the dolls from the 1980s then this is the one for you. We appreciate the speed in which it arrived. Thanks Amazon!!!!
4,See web site re this publication,Take a look at this web site before buying this book:[...]---The parent web site [...] provides much additional information related to this topic and this publication.

2,DRESS,I was not thrilled with this item. The quality is not so great and I received a quilted jacket rather than the one in the picture with the embroidered flower. I don't like it as much. I would not recommend this particular item if you are looking for quality. I bought one for my sister as well and she returned it.
4,My experience matches everyone else's,"The teleconverter definitely increases the reach of my Nikon 70-200/f2.8 lens. The 1.5-stop loss is a reasonable tradeoff.Beware of low light and/or low contrast situations. Your mileage will definitely vary by Nikon body. D3 autofocuses okay. D200 and D300s struggle, sometimes failing completely.I'm very pleased to have this in my kit. I use it regularly."
4,Don't trust Nikon web site,"I purchased this teleconverter only after researching on Nikon web site. There, they have a list on lenses that this does NOT fit. My lenses were NOT listed. Needless to say, it did not fit. As the Nikon rep. said, I have the ""cheap"" lenses. They are the AF-S Nikkor 55-200mm 1:4-5.6G ED DX and a AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm 1:3-5-5.6G DX VR. The lenses most amateurs and folks on a budget purchase. Why would I need this if I were a pro or could afford the $2500+++ lenses??? Anyway, I did give it 4 stars due to the quality and weight, and the recommendation from my good friend P.B.K. A world renowned photographer. I'm sure this is a nice item and will please the best photographers. Don't hesitate to buy, but do your homework or go to a retailer to try it on for yourself..."
3,Not Entirely Convincing,"I liked the book, it was a quick easy read. But it's not a keeper. I really feel passionate on the issue of contraception for the Christian couple. I feel this book was more like an idea than a teaching. It seemed the authors were trying to avoid stepping on anyones toes by rather just giving you something to think about rather than share their honest opinions. If I wasn't already letting God control my fertility, this book wouldn't convince me."
3,hmm,"I have the RL800 for 3 weeks ,it works on a 522m no hindering on the grass...But it don't work good. I have new grass and the mower can't follow the grass. Because of the long charging time,24h. (men that's long.)So i split my garden in parts but even de biggest part 320m, is not good after one turn?In the manual they speek about 450m ????And de battery works only 2.40h - and not 4h ???? (see other review)"
5,Fantastic Read,"All in all a good book that charts one of the most inventive shows in television history. SCTV on a bad day was better than most episodes of Saturday Night Live in my opinion, and this book chronicles the genius behind the show. I would have liked a bit more info on the actor's backgrounds and some of the post SCTV collaborations such as C.M.M. of Ed Grimley - but this book is both heartfelt and well-written, espescially in his honest reporting of the rest of the cast's resentment following his and Moranis' success following Strange Brew. A great read for any fan."
4,Dirt bike racer,"If you like to read, you will love this book! The book is fascinating because this book is about dirt bikes. Two boys find a dirt bike in a lake that was lost off of a house boat in a windstorm. The two boys get the bike out of the water and hope to win races with it. The boys meet a bully who tries to keep them from winning. I like the book because I think dirt bikes are awesome and I have always had a passion about riding them. Ages 9-adult should read this book."
3,Passover Seder 2008,"I chose this haggaddah over some other abridged versions because it actually opens and reads right to left, as any good Hebrew book should. It helped accomplish my goal of a short but meaningful seder. It would have been more enjoyable and more child or non-Jewish guest friendly with some traditional Passover legends we read every year as kids. The price was right at Amazon, especially since I ordered 12 books, which were shipped very promptly."
3,arrived very fast - but is a library reject,"I expected to have to wait much longer but the book arrived fast. I was really happy. It's in a good state but doesn't have the cover it was advertised with - it's a more recent edition and is a library reject, which wasn't said in the advert (so the book is covered but has a serial library number and a card attached inside.Amazon sellers are not very serious so probably querry first with them."
2,Good intro.,"The book provides a good intro for beginners. The best part is the description of the Tae guk forms, although it's essentially limited to the sequence of movements. It won't help you if you know the forms and aim to improve your performance. The remainder of the book, covering basic techniques and basic sparring moves, is simply too basic to be useful. The book briefly describes how to do a basic move, but never discusses the many things you can do wrong. Conclusion: no use beyond the green belt."
3,Thorough discussion of Taegeuk forms and free sparring,"If your association does not teach Taegeuk forms, much of this book (a very good method of describing form patterns) will be useless. No discussion of one, two, or three step sparring. More stress should have been given on training and competition etiquette. Good pictures and description on specific techniques. Overall - Good book, better for green belt and above."
2,Disappointing,"Although geared to the professional, the information is too vague. Too much emphasis on the artificial setting (old-time porch) and the beach. Also, the author seems to think all portraits lie in the medium format realm. I've learned much more about interesting ways to pose and light from wedding photography books."
3,"Nice recording, not wonderful, but nice","The orchestra sounds great. The voices not so great, but anyway this zarzuela is a marterpiece. I love it."

1,Could be easily confused,"If you are a parent that truely needs advice, I can give you some-don't bother with this book. It will teach you how to train your children the way you would train your dog, only if if you trained your animals like this you would go to jail.This book claims to teach christian values but teaches nothing about love which was the basis of Jesus teaching. You can train your children intellegently without spanking, or social services will do it for you. I wouldn't bother with this book."
1,Increase your body count,If you want a book that enables you to justify the torture and murder of your children through ritualistic abuse then this book is for you.
1,CRUEL and DESPICABLE!!!!,"It is a shame that amazon.com sells this book, which promotes whipping infants and treating children worse than animals in training!This book is a ""supportive tool"" for incompetent parents who want a shortcut to nowhere, as spanking always is, to maintain control over their kids no matter what. Whipping infants and spanking kids is cruel, humiliating, and disrespectful, and there is no valid justification for it. It promotes violence and fear, the main ingredients for hatred.As another reviewer mentioned, DSS should pay a visit to those parents who rave about this book, not to mention the authors.Amazon.com, I sincerely hope that you will REMOVE this shame of a book from your store!"
1,Sad,"It might ""work"", it's probably a lot easier than the time and patience it REALLY takes to 'grow' a child. If you can't be bothered to spend time with your child teaching them about life, but want a quick easy solution, and don't mind a little bit of child abuse - this book is yours! If you also believe that God is a lightning bolt that is going to strike you dead the minute you step out of line - go for this excellent un-Biblical approach to raising your child.However if you believe that God is a God of compassion, if you find it hard to imagine Jesus hitting an infants hand (because he has forgiven you for so much more than trying to grab your mum's glasses), if you love your children, if you understand that all children are different and have differing needs and if you have the intelligence to see that children are quite different to dogs...I'd say don't buy this book...it's not for you!"
1,"ILLEGAL, REPREHENSIBLE!","This book recommends whipping children, including infants , into submission, which, by the way, is illegal with pets! The authors also sell a whipping device to help do the job. Cruel , terrorist parenting behavior that can only contribute to terrible fear and shame in a child. No store or person should be selling or buying this book!"
1,do not sell this book,"Dear Amazon, please do not continue to sell a book that advocates child abuse. This is abhorrent and wrong. When I think of those poor children who have died...the authors should be ahamed."
1,"Disgusting book, incitement to child abuse; should be banned",I don't even want to waste my time explaining why this book is a horrid abomination.Amazon - don't sell this book; don't legitimize child abuse!
1,Hideous,"God, the Bible and NO one sane condones the abuse that is encouraged in this manual. And that is what it is.. a manual on abuse and control. Sickening. Revolting and more fundamentalist bull. If Jesus is the 'Prince of Peace"" why would you condone and think HE would condone, beating your child??? I agree sometimes a child needs a swat on the butt, but this 'author' and I use the term VERY loosely is nothing but a rage filled, evil man."
1,Please do not purchase this book!,"Watch the CNN Special ""UnGodly Discipline"" and see why this book is so dangerous. It teaches child abuse. A little girl in CA was murdered by her adoptive parents who were following the violent principles taught by some screw ball in TN with NO formal parenting or childhood education. This is NOT Biblical. ""Spare the rod and spoil the child"" does NOT mean to ""Beat them for hours, yes hours on end with metal rods, plumbing pipes, belts, wooden spoons, etc."" That's torture, child abuse and murder. So sadly, mindless people will read this book and for some evil reason, think it's right."
1,Abusive AND Ineffective,"If this were a dog training book, it would have been off the market long ago. I can't find the ""good parts"" that some reviewers refer to; all I see is a manual for abuse.If you wish to read parenting books by wise authors who actually have some expertise in child rearing and psychology, please look at books by William and Martha Sears, Penelope Leach, and Sal Severe.Children are not evil and they do not need to suffer to become good. If you feel that you must control your child's every action, or if your goal as a parent is to demand instant compliance, you might want to consider what is wrong with YOU, not your child.Do you want your child to be kind? Treat him or her with kindness. Do you want your child to love God? Set a God-loving example. You can't beat righteousness into anyone."
1,If only amazon permitted ZERO stars.,This is the most disgusting trash I have ever read. God help the children being raised with such cruelty.A child abuse manual and nothing more... deplorable.
1,A manual in horrific child abuse which people have used as an excuse to murder and torture children.,This is a book on how to make emotionally and physically crippled human beings. It should NOT be sold on Amazon. I advocate boycotting Amazon until it is removed.
1,Some Of These Practices Are Illegal In Canada,"This book is nothing but a child abuse and torture manual. In Canada where I am from, you are not allowed to hit any child under 2 years or over 12 years of age. Only the hand can be used and it must be reasonable. Positively no hitting on the head or face is allowed. Corporal punishment is prohibited in all schools, public and private.My advice as a Christian opposed to violence against children is don't do it. If you do, you should retain a good lawyer because you are going to need one. Will the Pearls pay your legal costs? Don't count on it.Edwin H. PeartWinnipeg, Manitoba, Canada"
1,Horrible,"This is a terrible book. Whatever happened to loving your children, which doesn't mean being a softy, but, this goes way beyond acceptable. These authors can't really be Christian."
1,To Whip and Abuse a Child,"These sick, sick bastards do not deserve to have children. As a professional social worker, who's an advocate for children and parents rights I feel that this ""book"" is dispicable, evil, and inappropriate. In whichever state these people are ""raising"" their children, protective services should be called and remove these children from these horrible, horrible parents.DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. DO NOT RAISE YOUR CHILDREN LIKE THIS- BECAUSE YOU WILL BE DESTROYING THEIR INNOCENCE. Good parenting is not based in fear.If I could, I would have rated this torture manual with NO stars....Amazon should reconsider their ranking system. But in order to be heard, I had to rank it with something."
5,Awesome book that shows how to train your child.,The book was well written and taught how to train your children. I purchased several copies and gave to my children to use with training my grandchildren. Working with children most of my life I have seen children who have not had any training literally abusing not only their parents but everyone around them. Training in a Godly way is the best training. Spanking is controversial to the world. That is why the prisons are full of adults who use to be children. Apparently and I have known some of them so I know for sure they had no training. If you wish to use this book to abuse your child you are wicked. This is not a ticket to abuse but to discipline and train with love. Wanda HersheyTo Train Up A Child
1,Abusive book,This is not a book that any parent should buy. There is never a justified reason to hit or whip an infant or any child. Parents please ignore this book and learn a better way to discipline your children besides corporal punishment.
1,Will never use these methods on my child,"I didn't read the reviews on this book before I purchased it, so I was extremely shocked with the type of methods they advise to ""train"" your children with. I have a 10 month old, and would never use any of these methods with her. It is very important to me to have well disciplined and respectful children, but I strongly believe that there are more effective methods than this."
1,Zero star option please,"This book is a disgusting manual on how to commit child abuse. Amazon has stopped selling other how-to books (how to make meth for example) but somehow step-by-step instructions on how to use plumbing line so as not to leave a lasting mark to fool the authorities is morally okay even when the press has proven that Pearl's advice has led to at least two murders. I wish the powers that be at Amazon would read this piece of trash. I think they would be shocked. Don't believe the superlative reviews that have appeared here in the last few days. I imagine they were written by the same author. Amazing, fantastic... Really? Let's work together to put this sadistic Pos out of business."
1,WOW,"I can not believe that people are okay with this. If you feel this way about your own children than maybe you should consider thearapy and resolve your issues with yourself before you PUNISH your children. AND NO... there is no GOD in this book. God would not be okay with you beating an infant with a rod. Some people are just sick. I do have children, 3 young children and none of which needed to be beaten by a rod or spanked before they were three... Anyone will tell you that my children are amazing when it comes to manners and respect. Maybe the law should look at these reviews and check in these peoples homes. Check on your kids with the bruises FROM YOU... the adult..."
1,Child Abuse,I read this book online and did not and would not purchase it. It is such a sad book. I can't believe that parents are being manipulated by their places of worship to buy into this form of abuse. Stay clear from this book and warn all new parents. Hitting a small infant???? That is incomprehensible. Awful advice from an awful unqualified nightmare of a man.
1,as bad as child porn,This book turns my stomach. The individuals who wrote this book are sick perverts who should be prosecuted for encouraging child abuse by distributing literature on ways to violate and assault children and get away with it.
1,Sick Sick Sick,"God did not intend for us to whip infants, children or anyone for that matter. These people are insane. I can't understand how this was allowed to be published."
1,Ignorance in interpretation,"The bible verse used to justify so much unconscionable abuse, ""Spare the rod and spoil the child,"" is a product of misinterpretation. True, the Roman word translated as ""rod"" refers to an implement of punishment (or torture.) The Hebrew word referenced in the quote as ""rod"" refers to one of the tools carried by a shepherd. The relevant quote is, ""Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."" The rod was used to guide sheep away from danger such as a cliff side. The staff was the one with the hook at the top; it was used to pull a sheep up from a difficult place or out of a hole (perhaps if the rod was spared - or ignored.) It just goes to show, ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."" It's particularly dangerous for the millions of children who have suffered at the hands of parents using (misusing) the word of God to excuse their own depravity."
1,"Child abuse, plain and simple.",Why the hell is this even for sale? This is pseudo-science at it's worst. Take this off the shelves and burn it as well as anyone that condones such an atrocity. Horrible and disturbing book.
1,Michael Pearl,Para Entrenar a Un Niño (To Train Up A Child): Turning the hearts of the fathers to the childrenMichael Pearl is a crackpot who sees no problem with the physical abuse of children. He is a true danger to society as a whole.The physical abuse of children can & does lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in the individual(s) receiving physical abuse from a parent(s) and/or adult(s).
5,A Parent Must Read,"Every parent should read this book! It is so helpful, and if every parent had used this book, we would have a much better future generation!"
1,these authors are sick!!,"the authors of this book should be thrown in jail for the rest of their lives for child abuse! They recommend beating children and even infants. After i read this book i felt sick to my stomach. from experience, i know that what they recommend is not only ineffective for creating happy AND obedient children, it is also down right dangerous, physically and emotionally! if a child is raised in the way these sickos recommend he may obey for a little while, but it is only out of fear, much like a slave would obey his master. but the damage is very severe in the long run. i would only recommend this book for people who are looking for ways to abuse their children, but absolutely not for any parents who love their children and wish to raise them according to God's word!"
1,"Amazon, how can you do this?","Amazon, how do you continue to let these people profit from their manual on child abuse? I will be finding my entertainment elseware unless you remove this from your sales list. It's disgraceful."
1,Wolves among the Sheep,"I read this book several years ago. When I first read it, I thought it was a great book. But the test of time and experience revealed the folly and heresy of the Pearls' teaching. Michael Pearl is a cult leader who is causing harm to many families. Save your money and your children. Stay away from the Pearls."
1,Child Abuse,THIS BOOK ADVOCATES CHILD ABUSE. IT ADVOCATES THE BEATING OF FOUR MONTH OLD CHILDREN. NUMEROUS CHILDREN HAVE DIED BECAUSE THEIR IGNORANT PARENTS READ AND IMPLEMENTED THIS BOOK. SHAME ON AMAZON FOR SELLING A BOOK THAT PUTS INNOCENT CHILDREN AT RISK. THIS IS NOT FREE SPEECH. THIS IS A TRAINING MANUEL FOR CRIMINAL CHILD ABUSERS.THIS BOOK PROMOTES CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN.THE MAN THAT CO-WROTE THIS BOOK LAUGHED AT THE DEATH OF A CHILD THAT RESULTED FROM IMPLEMENTING THIS BOOK AND HE PUBLISHED A PIC OF THE ITEM USED IN BEATING THE CHILD TO DEATH.
1,I CAN NOT Believe Amazon Would Sell this Bo,"OMG!I really can not believe Amazon would sell this book, that advocates beating children - including beating babies!Hidden behind the Bible (sound familiar) this book is a disgrace."
5,What happens when the child is grown?,"After all the beatings are done. After all the lessons are learned. What happens when your adorable, obedient son is a 6'3"" and 290lb man?What will happen when all of the compartmentalized rage surfaces because you (the parent) are no longer a physical threat. Remember, you trained your child to ""Do what I say or I will hurt you.""I'm sorry, but the police won't get to your home fast enough to save you from your grown child who is familiar with your aches and pains, knows where the weapons in the house are, knows when your home or away, and has complete access to you why you sleep?Whatever happens to you after you do this to your child, you deserve it."
5,common sense in child training,"My wife and I enjoyed reading this book. We are so glad to have found it early while our children were young. By following the Biblical principles outlined in this book our children have become well behaved, well adjusted children and a joy for us as parents."
1,child abuse,Recommending regular corporal punishment is considered child abuse in all civilized countries in the world. I am all for showing and keeping boundaries for children so they can grow up freely and safely. But one of those boundaries is not doing physical harm to them. This is not my understanding of the Holy Bible's loving message.
1,Dangerous -,If I could give this book zero stars I would. It is an outrage that this book is being sold at all. It is dangerous and the author is unqualified to give advise on parenting. He twists scriptures and stirs up fear and guilt to follow his scary methids. It reminds me of how to train an animal but I would treat my animals better than this. Spanking babies outrageeous! Take some child development classes.
1,What in the World Can you be Thinking?,"It is frightening to think that anyone would think it is appropriate to pull the hair of a nursing baby, or to spank a baby. Yes, I was spanked, and yes, I am alive; however, the damage it did (especially when I was forced to remove clothing for the process) will hurt me for the rest of my life. We cannot attack our babies this way and think it won't continue to injure. Shame on these two for writing such a horrible guide to torture! I hope child protective services are looking at these two VERY closely!"
1,Do you know how to think for yourself?,"This book is a wonderful How-To-Do-Book for parents who DON'T KNOW HOW TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES. God gave us a manual to use... USE IT, not this child abuse manual.If it were possible to give a score less than one star, I would have rated this book -100!"
1,A question about the cover.,"The children on the cover are acting in an unsafe manner, hanging off the back of the horse-drawn buggy. Will they be beaten for this?"
1,Here are some quotes from this book and the Author,The authors have not taken any classes on child behavior and development. They also condone switching a 4 month old baby. [...]
1,2 Deaths!! BOYCOTT,"Two children are actually dead after their parents used these methods. One other child was in critical condition. If that is not enough to tell you that the advice in this book is ABUSIVE then I do not know what else to tell you. The Pearl's reaction to these tragedies is to say it is not their fault and actually ""laugh"" (Michael Pearl's facebook response) to their critics.Personally, if two precious children died after their parents followed my advice I would not be laughing or even telling anyone that my method was good AT ALL.STAY AWAY. The Pearls will have to answer to God for their part in the murder of two innocent lives."
1,Sick and Twisted,"Don't even think about following the advice in this book, unless you want to go to jail for a very long time. Child abuse is a serious crime, and thousands of defenseless children across the country are mercilessly beaten in the name of Christianity, specifically the old ""spare the rod"" line. Maybe 4000 years ago this might have been acceptable but today we call it child abuse. Please join us in boycotting this book and protect our precious children from suffering at the hands of sadistic parenting."
1,How to train up a child,As a qualified health visitor I am appalled by this book and would recommend Amazon take it off their list as what the Pearl's advocate is no less than Child Abuse. The promotion of this product should not be allowed.My option would be to give it no stars at all!Christine Bidmead
1,ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!,no stars. this book is horrible. how can these people even claim to be Christian? anyone who uses violence in this way especially against babies and says they are Christian is a liar.
1,Child Abuse 101,"This book is absolutely discusting. If you are into beating your child and breading little monsters, by all means buy this book. If you have any morals, vote it down!"
1,"If you ever want your children to talk to you, don't buy/use this book","I was raised on this book and now that I'm out of my parents' house I can honestly say that the methods outlined in this book and by the Pearls in general are the reason that I have nothing more than a civil relationship with my parents. The control issues that require a need to ""break a child's will"" will not only break that child's will, but also break their character and any hope of ever having even a semblance of a good relationship with them once they reach adulthood."
1,Instant Results,"When we use fear to gain obedience, we get results. We also raise the next generation of violence.[...]This link is a much better source for parenting skills, tips, and information. All content within this site is conducive to those who have chosen to raise their child with a faith, as well as none.[...]Aha!Parenting"
1,Criminal advice,"This book encourages criminal abuse of children, advocating beating. It's written by some religious wackos who, since they have children and presumably wrote this in earnest, should be jailed. The writers struggle to make the point that a child in fear of injury and pain is a child well trained. Positively vile.I can only hope a criminal investigation results from their confessions and contributions to child abuse."
1,"Plumbing parts are for plumbing, Children are for loving","As a parent I am appalled by methods detailed in this book. I am sickened to think some parents might use plumbing parts as an acceptable discipline tool. I am angered that children of parents who used this book need to call themselves survivors once they leave the household. I am horrified that children have died while the parents hold firmly to the discipline outlined in this book. As a christian I am outraged they dare use His wisdom to justify their villainy. This is not Christ, this is not christian, this is not parenting, this is not training. This is vile and evil."
1,This book is Horrible!,"This book should be pulled from this site! It advocates child abuse plain and simple. The things written in this book made the blood drain from my face and my heart skip a beat. Tonight I will be praying for the children suffering under such ""parenting"" methods as listed in this book and I will hug my babies a little closer."
1,Worse than a horror novel!,"I wish there was a way to give this book no stars.It was like reading a book on torture. It scares me deep in my soul that people would recommend beating children, that a book could be written on child abuse.It was a nausea producing read. I actually cried at the thought of people doing this to their babies, and children. What ever possesses people to behave this way, is so beyond me. All the poor children who are totured in the name of God and Jesus. I say... what would Jesus do? Would he set an infant up top be beat? Or would he guide the child to better behavior. Was Jesus beat by Mary? I don't think so.I will pray for all the children who are harmed by this book, these people's teachings, and by any fool who buys this book.God bless the little children, and save them from the Pearls."
1,A Guide to abuse and murder of children,"""To Train Up a Child"" by Michael & Debi Pearl p.9 Whipping infants starting at 4 months old with sticks and pipes on their bare skin. A mother beat her children and killed her son after following the Pearl's baby-whipping advice http://www.nospank.net/n-p86r.htm"
1,Disgusting!,This book should not exist. It makes me sick.Can you imagine if there were a book telling you how to hit your puppy before he does anything wrong? It would probably get more negative press than this book.Any business who sells or advertises a how-to manual about hurting children is guilty of promoting child abuse. I will be writing to Amazon to let them know that I will not be buying anything from them until they stop selling such a horrible piece of garbage. I encourage you to do the same.
1,Unhealthy,"I could only read part of this. Our children are not for us to control, which seems to be the point of this book. What I did read used ""switching"" as a means of disapline and advised against rewarding positive behaviors. Multiple times compairing children to animals to ""train."" Children and animals are very different. But, neither need abuse.This book is not about effectivly learning how to guide and teach a child. Which is the real role of parents.I'm not sure if this statment is acceptable, but, some of the methods in this book, from what I've seen in life will send a child into a not so good adulthood."
1,Appalling!,"As a parent, former teacher and current children's software writer, I cannot fathom that any person who has studied or researched child development would offer any credence to the ideas being promoted in this book. This book is anti-Christian, and goes against what a number of respectable groups, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, have been teaching for years about healthy child-rearing. No one who wishes to raise an emotionally healthy and well-esteemed child will place any value at all on this book."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"I was first given this book 12 years ago when my oldest was four years old. What a blessing!!! Now with eight children, I can say that I have used the Pearl's training methods and ideas and it has blessed our home to be a home with obedient, loving, fun kids. Our kids are constantly complimented and praised for their behavior. They have learned to be a blessing to others and strive to live the life that God intended for them. Thank you Mike and Debi Pearl!!!"
1,The problem I encountered...,"There are many very reasonable ideas expressed in _To Train Up A Child_ that have me thoroughly agreeing in discussions about maintaining relationships with your child, natural consequences and the like. But then they'll throw in something appalling like advocating striking an infant, as if it is equally as reasonable. And I grieve for any world where striking an infant, who is so wholly helpless and dependant on their caregivers, is ever ok. Some people read the book and overlook those most offensive bits, and others see nothing but those words. But I find that the fashion in which advice that would stun the average person's sensibilities is mixed in with ideas that seem good and reasonable are what makes this book even worse, rather than redeemed. I've seen that same sor of bait and switch technique used as an effective propaganda tool."
1,"""How to Scar up a Child""","THIS BOOK IS A MANUAL FOR CHILD ABUSE! IT IS, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE MOST DISTURBING EXCUSE FOR A PARENTING BOOK I'VE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF PICKING UP! I WAS UNABLE TO READ THE BOOK IN ITS ENTIRETY BECAUSE I WAS SO SICKENED BY ITS CONTENT. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO REPORT A PARENT TO CPS IF I SUSPECTED THAT THE TECHNIQUES DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK WERE BEING USED ON A CHILD.[...]"
1,craaaaaaaazy,I would rate this book as nothing but big garbage.....These people are mental cases. They should be behind bars locked away from everybody. This is insane that people actually use this book Yes they do until they kill their kids. It is crazy that amazon actually has this pos....
1,Tell Amazon to BAN this book!,"I just read about a young girl who was MURDERED due to principles taught in this book. I also found about the girl who was killed last year - also because of this book. After reading more about it, I can't believe this book exists and can be sold without some kind of warning. The description of the book on this website does NOT give an indication about the horrors that are described within it (and I have not read the book but read enough excerpts on other websites to become absolutely sick to my stomach...)I am appalled that Amazon is selling this book. I just send them an email to tell them how I feel. I won't be buying anything from Amazon until they remove this book - and that's unfortunate b/c I literally buy everything from Amazon....If you feel as strongly as I do, I urge you to send an email directly to Amazon as well. Here is the direct link to their customer service feedback site:[...]"
1,Coercive Methods to Produce an Obedient Child,"To Train Up a Child is a how-to book. The authors, Michael and Debi Pearl, sketch scenarios of a child's, or infant's, ""behavior,"" describe how said behavior is bad or ""socially crude"" (6), and then provide a step-by-step method to change the behavior through coercion. Supporting the overall coercive nature of their program, the Pearls encourages provocation, inflicting of pain, hitting, ""thumping,"" swatting/switching even on ""bare legs"" (9), trickery, temptation, and neglect. The Pearls justify their abusive technique from bizarre interpretations of ancient Israelite literature. The authors reveal a rather unlettered reading of the literature, and cite passages from this literary tradition to legitimate their strategy. It's baffling how anyone could read this as anything other than irony. Sadly, I suspect, however, that many poorly educated readers will actually employ the torturous methods advocated here."
1,Run screaming from this book,"If Jesus was serious when he said ""It would be better for a millstone to be hung about his neck and to be cast into the sea."" ... than to cause one of these little ones to stumble, then the Pearls better learn how to hold their breath. The whipping of babies and young children as described here is unconcionable and unChrist-like and in most places, illegal."
1,"disgusting! If I could give zero stars, I would.",This book is just disgusting. A manual for child abuse. Any parent who follows the advice in this book should be ashamed and have their children taken away by CPS. Sickening.
1,Please Do Not Buy This Book!,"I received this book as part of a library clearing some shelves and I am glad that I did not follow the prescriptions it gives for raising children. While they correctly give scripture references for the need of discipline, they have interjected TOO much of their own obtuse thinking. Right now, in NC, a mother is on trial for the death of her 4-yr old son, Sean Paddock, who used Micheal's material. As a Pastor and father of two children, I believe in a biblical use of the rod, but I assure you that my goal in life is not obedience to me without any excuse but to life a life that glorifies God. If you desire a good volume that teaches parenting, I suggest the book entitled, ""Shepherding A Child's Heart"" by Tedd Tripp."
1,beat your kids into submission!,This book is basically how you can beat you kids and still interact with them with a smile on your face. It has lots of fun anecdotes and then is riddled with wierd ways to enforce your control over your kids. I was raised this way and I was so obedient I went off and joined a cult at age 18 and followed the cult leader with intensity. It took years for me to realize what was wrong with this kind of parenting! Don't raise your kids this way! In his newsletter the author suggests you use weed waker cable to whip your kids! How psycho is that?!
1,Stop Child and Baby Abuse,"The world does not need a manual on child abuse. Period. I AM a christian, a conservative, and NOT someone with an agenda. I have observed that the reviews seem to be polar opposites, so here is my two cents. BELIEVE IT OR NOT... HITTING CHILDREN AND BABIES is wrong...! Children do crave discipline and structure, but since when does that translate to hitting them? I'm sorry if it requires a little more *effort* to make your child realize precisely what they did wrong and how it hurt others and potentially themselves, etc., but as a kid who grew up with fantastic parents and yes, the occasional spanking, I always felt much worse when i realized WHY what I did was wrong than when I was in pain and confused. Please just use some common sense and caring, everyone! Why are we attacking the most vulnerable members of our society? Mr. Pearl must be a very, very sick man and I can only hope he realizes potential outcomes of his book.Would Jesus hit a child?"
1,Punishment fetish manual,"This book, which is a detailed manual of spanking, punishment and domination, reminds me of an incident which happened within the past few years. Several parents with a common interest were filming themselves spanking and punishing their kids in various ways and exchanging the tapes with each other. It seems they were viewing the tapes for the purpose of, how can I put it delicately, becoming excited (and I don't mean a trip to Disneyland kind of excited). I think Pearl and his wife have created the same thing here except in print instead of on VHS tapes. No doubt they exchange many exciting! stories with their approving readers about how they dominated, punished and whipped their kids. The really awful part though, is that they use the Bible to justify their sick fetish. These people are using God's name in vain. This books disgusts me in more ways than I can describe!"
1,What would Jesus Do?,"There are good ideas in this book. Unfortunately, there are also such poisonous and dangerously misguided ones that will appeal to peoples baser natures under the guise of 'guidance' and 'discipline'. Let me ask you, as a parent -- do you feel in your heart that God wants you to beat your children if they misbehave (according to your standards)? Leave the misappropriated segments of the Bible out of the discussion. Leave out the part where the Old Testament is used to shore up ideas that Jesus told us were unworkable in the New Testament. Leave out that these people who pretend to preach are in fact using your belief as a money-making vehicle for themselves. Ask yourself -- is hitting your child in your best interest? Is it in his or hers? Is command and control the only way you can 'train' your child, or could you possibly have been snookered into thinking violence is love? There are good ideas in this book. There are many, many bad ideas."
1,If you want to treat your child this way . . .,"If you choose to treat your child this way you do not need a book to tell you how. Just beat them until they fear you and you have followed every rule in their book. Satisfied? I just saved you at least $9.00.I have an idea, why don't you send that nine dollars to a battered women's and children's center.Parents have gone to jail and lost their children for doing less damage than this book recommends.I highly recommend that you choose another path for your parenting choices. Beating your child is not the answer."
1,this book found in homes of children beaten to DEATH,"Any book that gives you advice to 'thoughtfully' abuse your child is something you really need to step back and think about.There are so many, humane, kind ways to discipline your child...hitting an infant, because they want love, attention, connection? Unconscionable. That any person would even consider this, astounds me.Parenting is not the easy road. It's hard work...it's harder to creatively discipline your child than it is to just hit them. The old testament may have spoken of physical discipline, but it also says you can sell your children into slavery...those days and customs are no longer. (The bible also says you can't wear clothes of mixed fiber, your garden plantings must be separate, you can't eat pork, etc. etc.)I pray for the children of parents who practice this."
1,Stop selling this book Amazon-negative stars,How many people need to tell Amazon this...stop selling this book and others by the Pearls. They promote child abuse.[...]
1,Please don't abuse your child.,"There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said. The Pearls use religion as some twisted reason to beat the crap out of babies and kids. It's sickening. I don't hold with censorship, but I wish there were laws against ""parenting advice"" such as this.I wish I could give this book negative stars, but since one is the lowest, one it is."
1,Beware!,"The author of this book and his wife are dangerous people. They use Bible verses (taken out of context) to disguise their theories on the pyschology of negative reinforcement. The bit about pulling a breastfeeding infant's hair when he bites is enough to put a tear in anyone's eye. These are truly horrible people, the kind of fanatical, cruel, control-freaks you see on 20/20 and the like. But they would make excellent cult/commune leaders.I never like to give a negative review about a book without giving alternatives, so here are a few on this subject I recommend:Hints on Child Training...The Ministry of Motherhood...The Mommy Manual (by B. Curtis)...The Mother at Home..."
1,creepy book.,I bought the book simply for the reason I wanted to see for myself if the negative reviews were warranted. Wow. Is all I can say. I was spanned as a child when it was necessary not when I wasn't a mindless robot. And oh Mr and Mrs pearl? I'm not a crimminal! (Pearl warns your kids will be crimminals if they're.not spanked) and as a child protective services worker you are BEGGING for the state to remove your child should you think its okay to switch a three.month old! Sick sick book which takes a proverb and blows it wayyyy out of proportion.
3,Not the best but a good read nonetheless,"I can't pinpoint what I didn't like about this book. Maybe it was the lack of shocking in-your-face horror events (see Laymon, Clark, etc). Or maybe it was the character of Krissy. Whatever the case was I didn't enjoy this book as much as I'd hoped. On the up side the Indian lore makes this book worth reading. Owl obviously knows and thrives in Indian lore and illustrates this quite well in this book. This book is not as scary as other reviews made it out to be. I'd be interested in reading Crota or Darker than Night. I hear Darker than Night is supposed to be super scary but you never know until the read it right? If I could give this book 3.5 stars I would."
2,Over-hyped and gimmicky,"I ran out and got this record as soon as I heard it was out...boy was I disappointed! Generic covers songs (Let the Good Times Roll). Goof Ball novelty stuff Like the Beverly HillBillies Theme, ""My Name is Deke"", etc. Deke is hailed as retro rivalist, this sounds more like schtik!It does have good production and the playing is top notch of course. I just can't past all the goofy B.S. Over all it lacks substance!"
4,A nice short novel,"Although it takes place in 1910, this gives a good description of Japanese peasant life. Good for making you feel comfortable in the now. The story follows one family as their lives get progressively worse after the untimely death of the mother. Giving themes for their station and such. Takes place over many years, but in an almost fiddler on the roof kind'of way nothing changes."
3,Too much self-evident things,"First I must say that this book is not for snap-fit calculation, it is about snap-fir consepts. So it helps a lot in designing snap-fit as a whole (locators, guides etc). Not so helpful if you just have to design and calculate special snap-fit feature.Good book for beginners but it repeats too much too simple things -> too much ""fluffy"" pages, less pages would be better betterI would give 3 stars. This obviusly is not 5 star book, altough I would recommend this book if you are going to design more than one snap fitting."
3,It's okay...,"I'm an experienced cartoonist and wanted to venture into animal animation. This book is good for the over all view of the animals body shape...but's that's all it's good for. So, pretty much the basics. Still, it's always good to have when you forget the shape of the animal...after all there are thousands of animals that are shaped differently!"
5,Wonderful!,"I love the idea of putting cartoon animals into humorous situations, and this book shows exactly how to do that! Shows simple ways to draw some of the most seemingly complex cartoons! Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointed,"My hair is very wavy, and the comb did not heat up enough to do anything to the waves. Perhaps it would work to ""touch up"" hair that has been previously straightened by another method. But it definitely did not work to press my freshly washed/dried hair."
4,Blue Book,"Every so often a blue book comes along that really rocks your world and makes life so much easier. Life just makes more sense...Well, this is surely a blue book..."
3,designed mainly for social science ABDs,"I am going to see what could be made relevant to my research in English, but it was frustrating to see that it is so geared towards social scientists. The book has every right to focus on a particular type of graduate student (however it should be noted, I think), but since humanities grads are seen as fluffy, redundant and not ""fact"" finders, this book is not comforting for me to read. It re-emphasizes empirical evidence and thus continues to suggest (by not mentioning them)that humanities dissertations do not ""prove"" anything. While my dissertation will be organized around a ""problem"" of a certain kind, it is not something that can be tested or measured in the same ways as a social scientist's research. This makes it even more challenging to specifically define and finish. The book still looks well-written and addresses some areas that should be helpful if only mentally."
2,Sadly disappointing,"The flow of topics seems to be disjointed in relation to what a bride--or groom--should expect when making the decision to end a relationship. The book reads as a series of opinions, rather than fact, and is lacking detailed medical or psychological insight. Sadly disappointed."
4,Great Stereo Sound. Poor Images,"This show was recorded a long ago, so, just stereo but the sound is very good (the drums of Carlos Vega is very impressive). The problem is what you see: a poor images.Lee and Dave are great musicians and the invited people too (Ivan Lins, Diane Schürr....) playing some hits of tv movies and more.And Diane singing Amazing Grace, it's amazing, even with the poor images."
4,Channel Master Omni-directional SMARTenna,"This antenna provides a good alternative to high cable and satelite prices at a low one time price.I recieve all the major networks and many PBS stations from multiple directions, mostly all inHigh Definition which is sometimes superior to cable reception. Some of the fringe stations over 25 miles away fade in and out occasionally mostly due to weather conditions. (Rain, fog and windy conditions.) My antenna is mounted on a 21' length of 1+1/2 pipe extending about 6 feet above my mobil home roof. I believe the reception would be even better in extended a bit higher, and should be guy wired to reduce the wind effect. Although the antenna is ""omnidirectional"", I have found a minor rotation of just a few degrees can improve a weak station. Over all I am very pleased with the performance. I am about 20 miles south of Tampa, Fl and receive some 28 watchable stations not counting the spanish stations."
4,Great underrated old school thrash metal!,"This is some great old school thrash metal, sadly forgotten and unknown, most likely due to this album having not very good production job. Also, the kraze pressing of this cd is very rare, because kraze when out of business shortly after releasing this cd due to legal problems arising from not paying New Renaissance the money they owed them for the rights to the release, therefore hardly any where made, I would guess 500-1000 copies."
2,Take the intrerview out!!!,"...The music is really great. Coltrane is so awesome that his music magnetizes, you can't even put it at the background: it takes all your attention.Now the problem is that the interview is very poor... I think that even with talented interviewer the musical DVD should have the option to skip the dialogs and to choose to play the music only. It is also strange that the sound recording not as good as it supposed to be and the video picture is sometimes very dirty. Don't buy this DVD.Somebody needs to remake this DVD and make some cleaning of it."
5,I am a Jedi Mom!!,"Our family loves this game! We have all had so much fun. My 10 year-old son and I have officially made it through all seven levels. My husband and 7 year-old son are on their way as well! The technology is amazing and the game was well worth the money. And, it is almost as fun to watch others playing as it is to play the game yourself. I also love that you ""train"" and are taught moves which you use as the battles get more difficult. The fact that you have to pass one level before moving on to the next makes it an addicting challenge! Hint to the previous reviewer: for the spinning move, keep the lightsaber in one hand and twist your wrist back and forth to create the motion.My only complaint is that the directions with the game describe special forces II and ""power ups"" which are not in our game."
4,It's true,"Most of the comments from others on this toy are true.It is a little hard to master some of the moves, making it a bit frustrating for my 10 year old son and his friends to get past some of the training modes. However, with a little perserverance, and the some ""new eyes and hands"" to help figure out the moves, they can ""crack the code"".This game is also, as others have said, a form of exercise for the kids (as well as for me, when I have tried it!). Their faces are flushed when they ascend from the basement after conquering a new level!One thing we have noticed is that the handle of the light saber as a couple of plastic ornaments that protrude and can hurt after a while. There doesn't seem to be a way to remove them either.All in all, a great toy."
3,Its Ok,Good for younger kids gets old pretty fast for the older kids. There is no educational value with this product unless you plan to be a Jedi some day.
5,Great value for money,"You cannot beat this value for money. Does what it says - whiter teeth without having to pay much more than average toothpaste. Have paid much more money for whitening 'professional' toothpastes that are not even as good as this one. Highly recommend - and usually on promotion in amazon, so even better!"
4,Stewy Rating,"It brought back memories of my childhood & youth, growing up in Australia. Clive James reveals his ""Aussie"" brand of humour-which has established him on the international stage."
2,old age . I never thought the cornflakes would leave me .,"For those of you who have visited Australia in recent years , it may come as a shock to you that Clive James was the man who discoverd it . Jumping from captain Cooks ship ,when the hostile crew had threatened to eat him if he risked another witism . He discovered that the land was free from parking meters . "" Well boil mi billy can , cobbers , this is the place for me "" . So young clive tried his hand at acting, but was disillusioned ,when James coburn was cast as the aussie in the great escape . "" He sounds more real than you Clive "" . ""Strewth i'll have a lash at journalism "" . The rest is history . A raft back to blighty . A year as an assistant to clark kent , then unexpected fame as a latex puppet on spitting image . Its all here the unreliable memoirs, of the boy from Melbourne ,The land bought by Batman ."
4,Works,"First, I read another review by R. Lewis stating this is semi-deadly and the drug used in Murder on the Orient Express. This is NOT the drug; the actual drug was added into the valerian root tincture the murdered man always drank. And you would need to take a HUGE amount of this in order to experience adverse effects; on it's own it is not semi-deadly.I use valerian root extract when I need to get a good night's sleep. Works well to relax me and help me fall asleep. Yes, it smells and tastes terrible. But you actually do get used to it after a while. And it's all worth it to me since it works."
2,Did not flow ...,This was very difficult book to read - the writing style was bizzare and it did not flow. The idea of the twin brothers - and the bride marry the wrong man was fun idea. It had it's moments but over all I would not recommend this book.
1,Disappointing,"I was in the mood for something fluffy and romantic, and yet, I didn't get as engrossed in it as I thought I would. The storyline was pretty standard romance fare, and the writing decent. But there was something slightly off about it, apart from the obnoxious chapter titles (they reminded me of sitcom titles that are the formulaic `The one where...'). I didn't really connect with the characters and the story was a little slow and convoluted. And I didn't buy the ending at all. It's really hit or miss with romance novels, and I'd give this one a miss."
3,an ironic read,With the events of the World Trade Center terrorism yet to occur this book purports to show how the risk of flying is underestimated. It's scholarly and annecdotal at the same time.A strong sense of presque vu accompanies the reading of this book as you the reader knows of the Big Event that she the author couldn't know as it happened two months after the book was published.
3,Camera sucks!,"I bought this phone a little while back when it was new. I dont see any problem with the ringer. The graphics do suck, and the camera is the worst camera on a phone I have ever seen! It is just pixelated crap! If you want a phone that has a camera on it that is good, do not pick this phone. I hope the other virgin mobile camera phones are better, than this piece of crap."
4,Good phone,I really like this phone. I can hear the people i talk to and i can also talk to them a long time before i have to recharge it. Also it is real easy to use and i can keep all my numbers in it.
1,terrible service,"Virgin is appalling. I phoned about shipping charges and was told I could not activate my phone online, but must activate then and there on the phone.So - they weasled out of giving my friend who referred me to Virgin his $20 'kickback' reward. (You have to activate online for this).Afterwards, I phoned to complain - I was polite but firm, and requested they give the kickback reward to my friend. The 'customer service' rep put the phone down on me!!!!!I have never had this happen before.Watch out - no doubt Virgin display this sort of blatant thievery in other aspects of their service. I will get my mobile phone elsewhwere."
2,Poor,"should have paid better attention to reviews. Pretty much junk. Slow, steered poorly. Kids played with for maybe 5 minutes. Save your money"
1,Decent pomade; utterly putrid odor,"This is not a bad pomade, by my hair reeked so bad of a bad perfumey smell that it gave me a headache, and I chucked out a nearly-new jar. Seriously, the smell is so bad it makes AXE seem tame by comparison, and the AXE pomade I have left has way too strong an odor/perfume for me too.I am thinking about switching to something created in 1926....Murray's. I just don't need a pomade contributing so much to my odor signature that people can smell me down the street. Seriously. Smell before buying, especially if you're a male and don't want to smell like a grandmother all gussied up for full-contact Bingo."
1,"The disgusting ""scent"" of this product makes it unbearable to use","I am very sensitive to scents and certain chemicals. Because of packaging, I wasn't able to get a sample whiff of this product before purchase. I decided to go with it 'cause it was cheap.Well, the scent is horrible!!! I sniffed it as soon as I got home. Very displeased. But, since I wanted to show off the textures in my new pixie cut, I decided to use it the next morning! Yuck!!! I had this horrible scent emanating from my hair. (It smelled like turpentine!!!) Worse yet, I had an awful headache!!! The headache went away after two extra-strength Tylenol and a thorough washing.Yes, this pomade did keep my hair in place. But, health overcame vanity in this case. I suffered the entire day because of the OFFENSIVE SCENT in this product. It's in the trash!"
3,This is a harsh review but fair.,"This is a great release by the legendary texas, but the quality of the recording always bugs me. Its like they blasted the treble up and there is this ""whishy"" sound over the distorted guitars. But once you ve got over the poor quality sound you realise this is nearly as good as the proper albumn. Antique has a fantastic slurry riff that sounds way trashyer compared to other titr songs and dressing cold starts over with a great emo as hell hook. This is essential for any music fan with good taste, but they really did evolve for ""do you know who you are?"""
3,This is not the one I thougth it was,"Hey, this works fine but I thought I ordered the one with the built in foil cutter and it twists to remove the cork. This works fine, but the other version I like much better...why...cork remover, foil cutter."
4,A Bit Too Small,"All of the products work great and serve their purpose well. They are good quality and I like the design of the game holder. I only wish that the case for the ds was a little bit bigger. It's kind of a tight fit with only the ds in it, so there isn't room for much more in it."
5,card,"A quick way to use the affirmations that Skinn writes about in her books. Also, a great gift idea."
2,How to Make and Play a Dulcimore,The book arrived in good condition. I was disappointed by the fact that the index and detailed plans were not included with it.
5,Perfect for what they were designed for....,"These work exactly like they should. Sturdy, strong, and fairly attractive, compared to the ""cones"" that are also available. They stack well, and even offer a rubber piece to help them remain in place, and not slip on wood or tile floors."
3,"Sturdy 3"" inch risers!","The clear bed risers are sufficient for my purpose, which is to raise the head of my bed 3 inches. Equally important, the risers seem to be sturdy. However, a major drawback for me is the fact that the risers cannot increase my bed height to 4 inches if desired. The manufacturer specificlly states that ""only 3 risers may be stacked together."" In short, if you want to raise the head of your bed 3 inches, or the entire bed 2 inches, the risers are suitable--but 4 inches is inadvisable."
3,"Perfect, if you don't care about looks","These do the job, but if you care about appearance, these are not the risers for you. I guess if you are hiding them behind some decorative fabric, they are probably fine. They seem durable enough for a bed, though we bought them for our couch. While the material is clear, they are pretty big and definitely stand out. Stable, but ugly."
5,As advertized,"Our sofa was low and we were looking for something that would raise it a little to facilitate getting up. We stacked two of these together for each leg. Becuase they are clear, they are hardly visible under the skirt. The solution was found!!!"
3,An Interesting Presentation,"I have been turned off by the title which includes the word ""Addiction"", which to me is the ""Poor me, I can't help it."" excuse that people use, but decided to read it after hearing rave reviews.Sounds reasonable and I tried the plan for three days, but had to stop as didn't feel good. May try again. (Scored 34 on carbo addiction test.) Recipes look great, however, and plan to try a lot of them even though I may not follow the food plan exactly."
3,Carbohydrate Addicts Lifespam Program,Interesting outlook on the way you should eat if you feel you are a carbohydrate addict.
1,Don't waste your money.,"I don't see how these people can advertise this eating plan as non-depriving. Who has Tofu and Soy Flour in their pantry? It is no different than any other, if you don't mind living on ""odd"" vegetables, and concocting strange recipes, and eating salad until it runs out your ears, you'll do fine. Don't forget the gallons of water per day so you can spend your time in the restroom.I am a true addict and I don't like vegetables. The few I like are on the ""don't"" eat list. Can't have chewing gum, no flavored soda (even diet), and eating salad before breakfast. Who wants eggs, bacon wrapped in lettuce first thing in the morning?The reward recipes are nothing special. Just like any other recipe book. They have sugar in them and quite a bit.You might as well just go on the unhealthy Atkins. It is probably easier to just eat protein and nothing else. Lot less to remember.Too bad I can't give it less than a ""star"" rating."
4,Carbohydrate Addit's Lifespan Program,"My sister recommended this diet program and book and I started it 7 days before Thanksgiving. I have lost 19 lbs thus far with no pain. I can not imagine ""not being hungry"". It is wonderful. My doctor had recommended the Atkins diet but this has the reward meal and I am delighted. Very easy to live with. A breath of fresh air in the world of dieters. I always knew that I ate because I was hungry and now I know it was the message to my brain to send insulin when I was eating carbohydrates. I believe this is a plan that I can can live with for the rest of my life. TRY IT."
1,"The Carbohydrates Addict's Lifespan Program: Personalized Plan for Becoming Slim,Fit & Healthy in your 40's, 50's and 60's and",I was expecting simple daily meal plans and it was a lot of reading and recipes that are not always food items on hand. I was really disappointed in the book.
5,A straightforward plan that works!,Back in April I was looking for a simple plan to help me lose wight safely and permanently. After reading the Hellers' book I knew this was the best way for me. Since then I've lost 50 pounds and feel better than I have in years! Thanks to the Hellers for showing me the way.
5,Excellent follow up to the first book...,"A wonderful follow-up to the first book, The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet.This book adds a few new suggestions, such as eliminating diet sodas and other artificial sweeteners, and has many other options for making the diet even more successful.They also have a very lengthy scientific section in the beginning that explains exactly what goes on inside the carb addicts body. And proof of what excess insulin can do to your body if it goes unchecked.Very good book and very good program!"
1,this diet is dangerous for your health,"I took this book to my physician, and she said that this is afad diet and that it is NOT medically sound, so beware!"
1,Check with your Doctor,As a Doctor I strongly advise that you do not untake this diet without first contacting your own doctor. THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!!! Serious medical side effects might occur.
4,A solid product down to the container.,"It provides good shine, nice texture and medium hold. Unlike some other pomade and hairstyling products which tend to give me a headache due to their strong and offensive smell. This pomade's scent is very light and pleasant. It smells like cream. Seriously, I have to refrain myself from tasting it. I like the container's design, too. It has this minimalistic feel too it. Clean and stylish. OK, now onto why it gets a star off. Although it does provide good medium hold and the wet, shiny look, it doesn't last long. After about 2 hour or so, it just dissipates. Or maybe I just need to use more than little daps. But it could be an upside, I mean you don't even have to wash it off. It goes away on its own. Other than that, it is a very good product for its price."
5,TUF Season 2,"I had seen this season on tv, but found it extremely difficult to find on dvd. Everything was excellent, being uncensored always makes things better too. Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the UFC or The Ultimate Fighter. Thanks Amazon.com for coming thru with the product..."
4,301 Ways to Have Fun at Work,"I lost my job soon after ordering this book, so I don't use it at the present time. However, I am going to pass it on to someone who will use it."
2,Not pleased,I have two of these feeders and I haven't had one humming bird feed from it since I hung them seven weeks ago. I read good reviews on this feeder before I bought them and the birds will not use them. I have an old glass humming bird feeder and the birds gather around that one and feed all the time but they will not feed on this one and I don't know why. I hope this is helpful.
3,"Okay, but this whole book feels like a prequel","I have just started reading stories about the supernatural again, and I've been using a free book download offer to get started. This book isn't awful, but I couldn't get into the story because there are just too many words! Reading this with a Kindle app gives the opportunity to rapidly flip through pages, looking for the next place where there is something related to the plot. It felt like a prequel to the story of Arianna and her love. It satisfied the need for something quick and nondemanding, but not the need for a satisfying love story. sorry!"
3,"Ok, not bad","3 stars 3 stars 3 stars 3 stars 3 stars 3 stars 3 stars 3 stars 3 stars 3 stars 3 stars. This book was ok, but not great."
3,Dr.Atkins' NEW Carbohydrate Gram Counter,"Very good for the items covered, Fast Food section needs some work for California. Thanks"
3,Consider this other book first,"Please note that I have NOT read this book, so read this review with that in mind - I wanted to suggest an alternative, and a rating is demanded, so I put it at 5. Before buying this book, which appears to have a comparatively limited number of foods listed, please take a look at ""The Complete Book of Food Counts"" by Corinne Netzer. I *have* read this book and am very impressed. It gives the protein, carbs, fat and calories of over 12,000 foods, including nearly everything you're likely to encounter in a market, by brand name, and also fast food like Jack in the Box, Kentucky Fried Chicken etc. It's a great help in evaluating an unfamiliar food choice, particularly in that it can give an accurate measure of carbs instead of rounding to the nearest one for a ""serving"" as is done on packages."
1,don't waste time and $-look further,This is basically an out-dated carb counter-many new food items are NOT listed-like no Greek yogurts or other newer specialty items-only about 4 older fast food restuarants are listed and their foods listed are very limited. There are better carb counters out there-keep looking. I ordered 2 so I could always have one close-big disappointment
2,Misleading,"I thought this was a big thick book. This is just some pocket book. Here and there Dr. Atkins will contradict himself. If it's not him, it's the owner to the rights to his name. This was just some little pocket book that's like 4""x4"". There's nothing new here either."
2,It lacks other desired nutritional values.,"I was expecting to find the values for saturated fats and sodium for items listed, but was disappointed to see this relatively important nutritional information missing. Instead, it wasted space by listing the net carbs (which seem to be the carbs less the fiber, which are both included). I have been following the ""Body For Life"" program, rather than the ""Atkin's diet plan"", so I don't know what is important to you Atkins' followers. The Body for Life program encourages well balanced, nutritional meals, and NOT simply the reduction of net carbs. I was hoping this small, handy guide would help me plan a lower sodium, nutritionally balanced meal while I was on the road. Without listing sodium or saturated fats, I find the listings incomplete and the guide almost useless. It didn't meet my needs at all."
4,Handy tote-able reference book,"Despite complaints that the book is small, I found that it was very helpful to be able to carry the book with me and refer to it whenever needed. A 500-page tome would be a little bothersome when sitting at a table in a restaurant...I would definitely recommend this book as a companion to the ""New Diet Revolution"" book, and strongly urge anyone thinking about starting the Induction Diet for the first time to purchase the ""New Carbohydrate Gram Counter"" before they start. Why 4 stars instead of 5? A hard cover or spiral bound cover, and laminated pages, would make it easier to carry the book in purse or briefcase and use it in restaurants without worrying about ruining it."
2,Carb counter,This booklet was yellowed and had been used alot. Maybe I misread the description and it was being sold used and it was an older version than I was expecting. I was highly disappointed.
5,puzzling,i personally like word searches. full of fun and challenging puzzles. i do not think that 13 dollars is the best price in the world. there are not more then 100 pages and not 100 puzzles. but still a great puzzle book.
1,Duh!,"This was possibly the worst use of my money, EVER. Learned nothing new. Well, maybe I did learn that I'm already as good a leader as some of my peers, and a better leader than most since I found the ""practices"" in this short pamphlet (can hardly call it a book) to be no more than common sense."
3,I was expecting more from Pete Rock.,The album has some solid tracks but the beats are not what I had hoped. The hype from the source and other rewiewers led me to believe this was going to be the album of the year. The beats fall short on several tracks. The best song is truely yours '98. I love how Large Professor and Kool G. Rap rip the mic. I think Pete Rock should stop from rapping as he is awkard and it ruins the most of the songs. The album is still worth checking out but do not get caught up in the hype. It is solid effort but not the best Pete Rock has to offer.
3,Good for basic word sounds,"My 5-year old and I played this game (well, our own version of it) almost daily for the first few weeks he had it. It was easy enough that he could enjoy and feel part of the game, but not so easy that he got bored with it quickly (I think it helped that we made up some of our own rules). That said, he hasn't brought it out in while, so maybe he's outgrown it already..."
1,Obscure book of very little help,I had this book with me on my trip to Yellowstone and it didn't help me at all. 5 minute search on Internet gave much better orientation than 200+ pages of this book.
4,A Sentimental Journey into the Past,"Good Evening Mr. and Mrs. America, and All the Ships at Sea was a joyous romp in the past, when people -- especially the young -- still had ideals. The age of innocence was already over, but the hero of this novel just didn't know it yet. But he would find out, painfully; and when he does, he opts for an ironic way-to-forget change of plans. Read Bausch's coming-of-age tale for the pure entertainment of it, but when you finish laughing, quietly consider what it says of our nation's changed morality. Perhaps those of us who lived through it wonder: were we really just naive, or were we better then than what we became? P.S.: This would make a great movie!"
4,Entertaining,"Well written, flowed well. Portman is great and Kucher is better then usual. I was very pleasantly surprised. You will be too."
3,Too silly for me...,It was just too silly for me. I skipped throught most of it and saw that it had a happy ending.
3,A waste of good talents,"All the ingredients for a fine contemporary comedy are here, including a pertinent theme (the difficulty of finding love amid career obligations and easy sex) and an assortment of courageous young actors (Natalie Portman, Ashton Kutcher, Greta Gerwig, Olivia Thirlby). Unfortunately the director is Ivan Reitman, who's never made a more emotionally complex film than Meatballs (1979). Telling the story of a med student (Portman) and an aspiring TV writer (Kutcher) who try to navigate a ""sex friendship"" without falling in love, Reitman settles for easy laughs, and his off-color jokes about menstruation and drug use feel like greeting-card gags. The charismatic leads keep this watchable, but it's a waste of their talents."
2,a movie for high school boys,If you are a high school boy you might like this moive. Other than that it's a played out plot line that just makes adolescents think having sex means nothing. The movie takes about 45 minutes to even get into anything of substance.
2,Same movie as Friend with Benefits,"You get one ex-That 70's Show cast member or the other, it's the same movie with different actors pretty much, c'mon can't someone come up with something original."
3,Good but not Great,Decent movie with one of my favs - Natalie Portman. Just very lightweight entertainment that doesn't achieve the comedic level or the sexiness it should
3,3 1/2 stars for sexy and fun romcom,"Coming off a highly praised turn in ""The Black Swan"", Natalie Portman does an acting 180 in this fairly traditional romantic comedy. There is certainly nothing new here. Can platonic friends be sex buddies without all the romantic entanglements? Yeah, good luck with that. Portman's character Emma is a medical student working an 80 hour week and looks to a friend she first knew when they were budding teenagers, to provide sexual release. Adam (Ashton Kutcher) works on a TV series, obviously helped along the way by his famous actor dad played by Kevin Kline. We certainly know where the movie is going to go, so how much fun is it getting there? More than we might expect. Portman and Kutcher work well together and push all the right buttons. There is no question Portman adds a certain acting legitimacy to what is pretty much a cookie-cutter plot. The movie is sexy and fun. What's wrong with that?"
3,Seinfeld Said It Better In A Half Hour,"Sex without love is an impossible task? Some ladies of the evening may disagree. This isn't a bad movie just a totally predictable one. For the first two-thirds of the film it seems like it's nothing but a bunch of self-absorbed yuppies yammering about their delusional opinions on love and sex. Ashton Kutcher's randy dad played by Kevin Kline was the only thing making the enterprise palatable. It's only in the last third that the film redeems itself when it reaches the inevitable conclusion that yes, love between two people is a possibility. They released this film over Valentine's Day Weekend and I guess it would be a servicable date movie though those offended by rough and frank language might look elsewhere. Otherwise, it's pretty forgettable. Natalie, you won an Oscar! What are you doing in ho-hum fare like this?"
3,No Strings Attached (HD),"Funny at times, but too much like Grey's Anatomy. Seems like they were trying to copy that TV show. Not very original."
4,Pretty Good,"Chose to watch because it was free and went into it with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Mildly funny with some good moments, not a great story line but very decent with ironic twists. In my opinion, worth the watch."
1,Supremely shallow and intensely boring,"I was so bored while watching this that I could scarcely draw breath. This has SO been done, and done and done again."
2,...not sure if 40 minutes qualifies for a review...,"...but that's how long I hung in there waiting for the movie to 'develop' before I opted out. But then again, I guess that is the review."
2,A sleezy Friends with Benefits,If you have seen Friends with Benefits you will be disappointted in this one. This movie has zero class. It is vulgar and sleezy from the begining to the end and has none of the charm of FwB. The chemistry is also missing in the lead characters. Do yourself a favor and watch FwB again and just skip this one.
1,Not Even Mindless Entertainment,Role reversal. Girl interested in sex but not commitment. Boy gets attached. Girl breaks up with boy then realizes error of her ways. Boy willingly takes her back. Movie is as bland as this review. Waste of time.
1,"Stupid, stupid, stupid.","I never thought I'd say that Ashton Kutcher is a better actor than Natalie Portman. This movie boasts at least two Oscar winners, and I can't for the life of me figure out why."
1,Worst Natalie Portman ever,"Not only is this a fairly simple minded and predictable romance story - I can enjoy that if it's well done - but everything about this film is less than mediocre: acting, directing, everything. Don't waste your time."
3,Not bad,"This was an ok movie. Kind of sappy and cheesy, not a bad date-night movie, but not Ashton Kutcher's best work. I'm stoked that I could get the Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital combo, then again, this isn't a movie you'd want to watch on an ipod, not that great for solo viewing."
3,Light hearted movie,The movie was good. I like Ashton but not sure if I would have casted Natalie Portman for the female role. But in any case the movie was good however I am not sure of the ending. Maybe I missed the point of what they were doing. I will watch it a couple more times to let it sink in.
4,very funny,I enjoyed this movie vewry much.I can't wait to see Ashten Kutcher in next seasonstwo and a half men. He shiold be terific.
3,It was much better than I expected,"True, I'd just finished watching the terrible film, Life As We Know It, and so my expectations were in the Pits of Hell but still...this was much better than I expected. Natalie Portman and Ashton had very little credible chemistry but the film was still pretty good. I did smile a few times and they were both individually charming."
5,great movie,"this movie was great, had a great story line. Also it doesnt end when you expect it too, i would recommend this movie. not a corny ashton kutcher movie."
3,"fun, but bubble trays are more fun","We love Spongebob and bubbles and not spilling, but it does spill a little bit if you fill it more than half way. Also, one of my kids gnawed on one of the bubble wands so now it doesn't fit in the slot. Since purchasing this product, I've discovered jumbo bubble wands that come with round shallow dipping trays, so the kids can make humongous bubbles all by themselves without ever having to worry about dropping the whole bottle of bubble solution."
1,A highly questionable book,"Just recently a man by the name of Zhishi Li claimed to be Chairman Mao's private physician. This incredibly bold claim seems to be severly lacking in credible evidence. That being the very individuals that could support this argument are dead or probably will not waste their time on such a trival work. The only argument one can make about this book is its lack of historical evidence along with Harrison Salibury's Three Emperiors. I don't even believe the editors of China Quarterly(a scholarly periodical dedicated to research on China) even wasted their time in reviewing this book. If any reader is interested in reading good books about Chairman Mao. See John K. Fairbank, Jonathan Spence, Maurice Meisner to name just a few. The only use of this book will be used to endow undergrade students with the ability to critize historical books."
1,fiction work masquerading as history,"GIven all the controversy and critiques of the book's publication and translation, this is not to be read as a true story of Mao's life. The author makes up dialogue from 30 years past the time of writing, and describes events at which he could not possibly have been present. Mao's bodygaurds and others have, in Chinese, denounced the author and directly refuted the book's sensationalist and orientalist pandering to reactionary Sinologists and ideologues. I wish I hadnt bought it, as it has little value as a meoir or history."
2,Ouy Vey (As Carl Marx would Say),"This book misses out on the real Mao Se Tung. The man with the big smile, the man who loved little doggies, the man with a song in his heart, and the fact that he was a great dancer.I'll still give the book two stars because it is about my dear friend but otherwise I am very disappointed."
3,"Sorry...India, Just not bad...","I'm a big fan of India,coz her debut is really amazing!!!Her sophomore ""Voyage 2 India"" is good,though not excellent...But this one,I can only say not bad...I did hear some changes,such as ""The Heart Of The Matter"",""Good Morning"",but the rest of songs didn't catch me at all...The single ""I am not my hair"" is decent,but so similar to her former songs.C'mon India,I'm looking forward to Vol.2..."
1,Repetitive and Stale,"You can listen to one of these songs, and dump the rest. The song with Akon lacks significantly."
1,"Please, Someone Wake Me When It's Over!!!!","I had expected better from India Arie on this her junoir album. Actually, I had hoped that her sophmore attempt would have been much more appealing as well. After such an amazing fresh debut album, it seems India is only capable of pumping barn fodder. She just wallows in a boring repetative, same music-different words slump. This as well as the second album are best adminastered as slipping pills just before bedtime. Please someone, wake me when over."
4,fabulous,"I could listen to how India does ""The Heart of the Matter"" a million times and never tire of it. This CD explores the range of her talent. I love it."
4,Spirit,After one listen to this CD I realized what people should appreciate about India... her songs are unique in that the spirit of the lyrics and the spirit of the music are united.
5,A Must Buy!!!,I am a huge fan of India. Arie and her latest CD is by far my favorite. It is so inspirational and really speaks to the listner about the lessons she has learned about life and relationships. It is also great to hear the progression in all of her three CDs. There is a constant growth in her music and I am really looking forward to her next album. Enjoy!!!
5,Magnificent,"I've loved India Arie's music ever since she came out with her first album and I will continue to enjoy her music. If you want something that you can relate to, makes u think, and be thankful for being who you are not matter the circumstances or what you thought about yourself, try this. She is so encouraging in her music and she teaches as well. I LOVE IT!!!!"
3,Not the best,"I understand that every artist wants to grow...however I wasn't impressed with her growth on this album. It was a decent album overall but nothing like her first one. My favs on the album is ""Private Party"" and ""There's Hope"". Though the album is less personal it does allow you to put life into perspective and causes you to look inside of your self and realize what you have."
3,Too sweet,"This review is for their dark chocolate. Most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects...not the sweetness! Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didn't use any sugar at all with their chocolate!I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their aren't many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that."
2,Misleading item description. Most songs not performed by Frank Sinatra.,"I was ordering this as a favor for my grandmother, who wanted to buy her friend a CD of Frank Sinatra singing New York New York. Upon receiving it, I discovered that only the 1st album is songs by Frank Sinatra. The 2nd CD is performed by 101 Strings Orchestra, and the 3rd one is performed by The RRSO.I am returning this ASAP."
3,Clever adaptation,"This is a clever adaptation of the traditional patriarchal medieval tarot. It maintains the basic structure so as to be useful to those used to the old Rider-Waite European deck, but it sets the cards beautifully in Native American culture."
4,"Not Bad, Not Great.....","I don't know why Live is related to Pearl Jam. Live is cool, and so is Pearl Jam, but Live is almost religous. They aren't as heavy as pearl Jam or Soundgarden. But still a good band. Songs 1-13 on this album are good. The others aren't quite my thing. The Johnny Cash song isn't bad. But songs like Heaven, Nobody Knows, Run Away, are kinda weak. I am getting the picture that you want to avoid Birds of Pray. Despite all the bad stuff I just said, Live is an okay band. I think this is for people in their 30's that used to like grunge, but are now realizing that they are just to ""old."""
1,What Are You People Listening To?,"I read with interest peoples comments. Life affirming stuff...people wrote. I looked at some reviewers other likes and saw that they liked the same type of music as me. They sound like U2 sometimes apparently or erm Led Zep etc. Best CD ever someone wrote of their album Throwing Copper. Hey your words, not mine.Then I got this album. What are you people listening to? Take REM on a very bad day (and that is baaaaad) mix in The Waterboys minus the songwriting ability and sprinkle with a little Nickelback (and that is not a good thing) and voila you have this band. Yes that bad. The singer sounds like he's going to have a stroke in the choruses. Weak weak weak. A duet with Shelby Lynne tells you how crass this all is.Hey guys, if you are that easily impressed Ive got a sparkly pen you can buy off me.People call this alt rock, I agree, it is an alternative to anything worth calling rock. Avoid. Seesh."
5,Excellent Wife,"This study is very challenging and difficult to accept at times, however, a wonderful Bible study and I recommend it highly. It is a long study (we did 2 chapters per week most of the time), but it has been worth it."
2,Cheap cases; several cases already broken upon receipt.,"The colors are cool, and the space savings is great...but everything else is not. Wish I would've purchased something different, but live and learn! It's too much work to return and it wouldn't be worth my time/money so I'll just deal with these."
3,Not as good tactile response as I had hoped,"I have carpal tunnel and need a keyboard that is very sensitive to touch, i.e., will not require a hard ""punch"" of the keys. By reading the reviews here and elsewhere I thought this would be a great keyboard for me, but I find that repeatedly the letter ""t"" does not respond to my finger and I keep having to backspace to put it in. I did not have this problem with other keyboards and can only surmise that when they set up variable touch on this keyboard they assumed that everyone has a really strong index finger. (I already dropped a ""t"" in this review!) Otherwise it seems to be a cool keyboard, and I am hoping I can retrain my left (dropped that t again!!!) index finger can re-learn to hit harder on the t. A disappointment, so that's why I give it (another dropped t!) only 3 stars."
1,Conair has no quality control,Conair has a knack for making products that look like exactly what I want. This is what tricks me into buying them. However this is the 3rd Conair Phone product that I have purchased that just flat out didn't work when I took it out of the box. None of the buttons on the unit worked. I was unable to set the clock or do much of anything. Useless. Seek a more quality product elsewhere.
1,dimensions,"Why isn't there a list that shows the dimensions of the clock radio/phone. It has to fit on a nightstand, so it should have dimensions."
3,Starting Out: The Pirc/Modern,"Book for player under 2000 with basic strategy.Lot of games was analyzed/published in books like as Pirc Alert! (Alburt), Modern defence (Speelman), Pirc defence (Videki), Pirc by Nunn&McNab without blunder check.Not useful for experience player.However missing more space for Modern (when is in the title ...)"
5,"Valuable Guide, Great Price For The Information","This is a valuable guide for anyone looking to purchase a business. There is a lot more information here then you will probably need, but as a reference work it is an excellent tool. The sample contracts that are laid out are excellent as well. As a business owner who recently purchased another business, this guide is very helpful. Buy it and use it - you will be glad you did.Some of the great features:* CD-ROM included with blank forms. This is great. Includes more than just contracts . . . confidentiality agreements, closing checklists, security agreements, and more.* Sample contracts . . . if you don't have the time to comb through the whole book, skip to the sample contracts in the back and you will learn a lot very quickly* 400 page reference work - there is a lot of information here, probably more than you will need* Updates online - This is the third edition, and additional updates are available online as things changeHighly Recommended."
3,Save Your Money,"I'm a Britney Spears fan, but I'm not too fond of this single. ""Sometimes"" is a decent song, but the remix is too cutesy for my taste. I did like ""I'm So Curious"" but I don't think it's worth buying the cd just for that track. If you like ""Sometimes"" look for the Thunderpuss remix, it is a hundred times better."
5,Coby CX-CD248 Portable BoomBox,"This boombox fits just what I wanted it for at work: Radio, cassette, CD, and small enough to fit in my workspace. Perfect for me."
2,Realize it is not good quality,I have owned this one for about 2 years. It it very limited in uses. Sometimes the CDs play and sometimes they dont. It is very cheap and I will be replacing it.
1,never again,the cd part didn't work after the first day and when I contacted the company they said I had to pay to ship it back and pay for return shipping. I decided to just trash it and never buy coby products again.
3,BETTER than I thought it would be,I was looking for a boombox that a blind man could use and this turned out to be better than I thought it would be. He uses it almost everyday..but it does use up the batteries faster than I thought it would. But it comes with a power cord and that makes it easier just not portable. Since he is pretty much stationary this does not present a problem.
2,Started out Great,Brought this for my wife to jam around the house with cd's and some of her old school cassettes. She loved the sound of it and really enjoyed it for about a week until the cd player died. We are returning it but they were out of stock so we upgraded to a better unit from a different company
1,Hmm... didn't stand the test of time,Previous review changed. This died before reaching age 1 year. Icy Dock have proved simple to use (have owned several different docks) but unfortunately the quality of build seems generally to be low. They all seem to faulter after a while. Will most likely go a different route next time around.---Does exactly what I want - make changing all those SATA drives I have lying around very easy. It using the FireWire 800 is also superfast. The only thing I can criticise is that it feels a little cheap - a little plasticy.
3,Don't buy both books,"Don't buy both ""How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation in California, 10th edition"" and ""The California Nonprofit Corporation Kit, 4th ed."" expecting two different books--they contain exactly the same contents, the only difference is the ""Kit"" comes in a three ring binder."
1,hi,"very bad seller. book was okay, but, incomplete in more than one way. It did not contain disc. nor section on mutual benefit corp."
2,nothing really new,I was hoping to learn something newand important about aerodynamics butthis book gives me the feeling of multipleDeja-Vu's.
2,no spill bubble tumbler review,It was smaller than I expected which made the price i paid a little disappointing.
4,"great set, hard to read inserts","Great set, nice mix of songs, but it is hard to read the inserts with the color and size of text."
5,A TV Classic Finally on NTSC!!!,"While I am a little miffed that this is part of Warner's overpriced Archive Collection it is nice the great mini-series from a little over two decades ago is finally available! A slam-bang tale from start to finish, chilling with all kinds of potential suspects and a really remarkable sets to make you believe you are back in Whitechapel in street fog and danger. Great performances by Michael Caine, Jane Seymour, Armand Assante, Lewis Collins and Edward Judd. Not to be missed."
5,Little known but a fantastic period piece,"One of my favorite movies of all time. I show it to my 8th grade class in order to explain the foundations of our Revolution and democracy. Movie has terrific acting, costumes and worth battle scenes. AG and RH are beyond good. Makes Cromwell out to be a better man than he probably was but it is before he takes over as ""Lord Protector."""
3,IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT LET THE HISTORICAL FACTS GET IN THE WAY OF A GOOD STORY,"I'd suggest that the best reason to get this movie is because Richard Harris turns in a classic performance as one of England's most famous, yet, misunderstood figures. That's not a bad thing, because if he played Cromwell as he really was, no one could stand this movie. Harris, an Irish man, presents a heroic portrayal of the 'Butcher of Ireland', as Cromwell is known. One wonders if Harris needed to be drunk having to present Cromwell as heroic. As it is, the movie is a good piece of entertainment. The battle scenes are well done, though wildly inaccurate. Historical note: The New Model Army outnumbered the Royalists at Naseby, not the other way around. Sir Alec Guinness presents a fairly accurate portrayal of Charles I. Though he comes across as arrogant, one cannot help but sympathize with this king: he was just protecting his kingdom from the likes of Cromwell."
2,it's ok,the history is interesting but the movie does not hold up as well as A Man for all Seasons or Becket.
4,Cromwell,"'Cromwell' is about power, the movie depicts the struggle betweenThe Parliament and the King... that eventually starts the English Civil War.King Charles is played superbly by Alec Guinness a thespian of the highest order- (King Charles)is an ineffectual and some may say a weak King, bringing the monarchy to its lowest ebb due to his indecision and the backing of the Catholic over the native Church of England (not Protestant but a REFORMED CATHOLIC church) amazing what we can learn at the movies!Anyway... Cromwell's new army, wins the Civil war and the Parliment takes its new place at the head of the country.Richard Harris is good, but somewhat over the top, as the brooding Cromwell, his voice is croaky and at times the Irishman looks all at sea! the musical score is average, well shot and framed... An excellent informing entertainment, a movie well worth watching."
1,Not as expected,"You get less than half of what's pictured. You get the awl on the right, two needles and one spool. Arrived pretty quickly, though. The awl itself is made with really cheap wood, but the metal bits seem alright."
3,3 stars is the average,"i give the glasses themselves 5 stars. they are heavy and pretty and nice quality. but the service that i received from target gets 0 stars, for an average of 3 stars total. i couldnt have been more frustrated with target. i ordered 12 glasses, they sent me one. and it was someone elses order, they had packaged it wrong. when i called them, i got the run around and they told me what they would do to fix the problem, and they didnt do it. then they backordered the order til way after christmas without letting me know, leaving me with no gift at the last minute. they finally arrived at the end of january. AWFUL!!!"
4,good overview for lesser known works,When reviewing for National Boards--this was a useful tool--concise info and reminders of work I'd forgotten--very useful.
3,"Something Like ""Road Kill"" if you've seen it","The guy who played Trevelon or whatever the name was in James Bond Goldeneye is a hitch hiker who is just insane and kills people cause he has a death wish or something.These two young college kids almost run him over and then end up giving him a ride and he turns out to be nuts and tries to kill them.Thats about the whole plot, it's an action thriller kind of thing, along the same lines of Roadkill/Joyride which I would not be surprised to see these titles sold together in a pack soon.Roadkill is a hell of a lot better then this one, but this one is OK and can fill in the time for the thriller horror fan, it's not bloody, but if you like some decent special effects of blood n guts (like i do, i laugh at them there so cool) then this is an OK movie to check out."
3,Much Better Than I Expected,"After all the negative reviews I thought this would be a waste of my time, but The Hitcher remake is a tight and bloody little film. The movie is only around 78 minutes, so you won't lose too much of your life even if you hate it. Sean Bean pulls off his part really well and Sophia Bush is one of the prettiest girls I have seen in quite some time. If you like all the recent horror remakes this film will likely please you."
1,Frustrating,"I so hated Sophia Bush's character. I just kept waiting for ""the hitcher"" to kill her off!!! The original was much better. I don't remember it being so annoying.Ricki in Texas"
1,One star,"Because Zero Stars wasn't an option.Suspense/Horror movies are at a crossroads. The movie-mill films like this one insult your moviegoer who has a little more than average intelligence and a desire to combine thrills/chills with a believable production.I watched this whole movie through, because I (shortly into it) began rooting for the Crazy Hitchhiker Man, simply because for the protagonists to make the insane decisions they make, escape alive, and procreate, would infect the gene pool with an offspring that would have a medical condition that prevented them from using logic and reason.I'm not anti-popcorn movie, don't get me wrong. Its just when the characters do STUPID, STUPID things, over and over, there is only so much you can accept as being ""under duress"". This movie quickly makes you hate the two main characters, and cheer for their demise, which is the exact opposite effect I bet the director intended.This is just a bad, bad movie."
4,The Hitcher,I am a fan of Sean Bean This is a real thriller and Beam pulled it off well. It is different from the original but a great flick.
2,Motorcraft fuel pump,Pump came snail mail took over a week when parts from other suppliers took half the time. The connector plug was damaged and since the car to be repaired was completely apart before I discovered it. I was forced to splice the plug from the old pump in order to complete the repair. I would have gladly paid for more efficient service had I known about the delay. Which is why I didn't want to attempt any return or exchange process.I did E-mail AC-Direct about the situation and received no response at all. That was disappointing to me.I purposly waited to write a review so that I would be able to share how they handled it. After the splice work the pump seems to be functioning fine.
2,Beware,"My review is on a similar watch from DKNY purchased thru 88 Watches. It is a lovely watch but be warned, they charge a restocking fee and don't refund any shipping"
1,An assessment of restoration drama.,This book proved to be poignantly pointless. It really sucked. Both the authors of the drama appraised as well as the author of this book should never have been born.
4,Solid Storytelling,"I wasn't always a fan of Superman, but this book made me one for life. The storyline is riveting - particularly the relationship between Jonathan and Clark - and the characterization is compelling. After the action of ""Death of Superman,"" this is a welcome addition because the depth the authors give all the actors. The illustration work is dated at this point (check out Lex's awesome red beard and hair), but it holds up as a critical point in the story's history."
2,Yuck,"If you've ever had the ""real deal,"" you'll know this isn't it. After having had the Trader Joe's brand and the Giradhelli (sp?) brand, this stuff doesn't even compare. Very artificial-tasting. Don't buy, especially if you're using it in a recipe! Suck it up and pay more for the top-brand stuff (or make your own), it's worth it."
5,Frog Holler......,This gang of Pennsylvanians are awesome with a creative flair ...The music is genuine and from the heart! Looking forward to the next CD.
5,Columbo 2nd season,"Hey, this is neat, at a great price. Looking forward to 3rd and 4th season dvd's."
4,Pretty darn solid,Basically they took the music I listened to college and put it on a box set.Disc 1 and 2 are fantasticDisc 3 is excellent and Disc 4 is really good.Overall a great collection of music.
1,When is a Schrade not a Schrade?,"The answer is: when it's ""Made in China"". What a disappointment! I thought I was buying the quality knife that had been made in the US for a century...I got a knockoff that is a flimsy shadow of the real Schrade knife which I now find can mostly be bought from those with leftover stock. READ THE DETAILS!"
4,Good show,"Hello, (some spoilers beware, minor)I have to say this show could have been much better. The first half was severely addictive to watch. However I feel it dropped off by the end. It reminded me a lot of shangri-la with the same concept on how the whole utopia city was created. And I have to say that threw me off. If your looking for a show just like shangri-la then this is your show. If your looking for a show with a good solid ending, that doesn't just throw some mythological concept at you in the last few episodes so they don't have to explain the many holes in the story, then look for another show. A better rebellion anime where people fight the current regime, code geass lelouch of the rebellion will be more north your $. The story is solid, and it grips you with an intense provocative storyline all the way to the end of code geass r2 (season 2)."
4,Some people just don't know what they are talking about.,"For those who can get past the Mmmbop stigma, Live and electric is amazing.For those who have been a die-hard fan since 97, Live and Electric is a must have.It is a perfect glimpse into what going to a Hanson show is actually like. It's raw. It's loud. It's emotional.Nobody but a lifer Hanson fan could ever appreciate this CD. And to prefer a studio version over these tracks....well. That's just sad. These guys are way better live.Live and Electric is a perfect blend of songs and harmonies. These guys display so much passion when performing live. It's what they live for. And this CD is evidence of that."
3,It's fun to own......,"But it's not really a cookbook that I'll be using anytime soon. There are recipes for sandwiches that are unique, but I'm not a fan of the ingredients that are being mentioned."
2,battered but had info,"The copy was very battered and full of highlighter underlining. For what I wanted ( an information source to pass on to students doing a project) it was OK. My other low cost books from the Amazon site have however, been in much better condition."
3,"Good ingredients, great concept, but stale","I love the nutrition of this bar: low sugar and high in healthy fats. Unfortunately, the nuts tasted stale--almost like it was bordering on going rancid. I'm not sure if the stock I had was fresh :( However, Amazon may have replenished their supply."
3,Disappointed.....,"I found this book to be very disappointing compared to the first in the series. I loved The Invitation because the characters were very believable. This book however seemed to be competing with itself as to which character could have the most outrageous thing happen. The dialogue with the angels was neat, but the spiritual warfare part of it seemed almost amateur. Cute book, but overall I was far more impressed by the first one."
3,Smaller than it looks,"I was a little disappointed in this item. I wanted a wooden 5 foot height chart. I thought this item fit my needs. But be advised that the chart starts at 2 feet and goes to 5 ft. On the wall of my duaghters room, its looks small and narrow. The fact that it folds up just makes it easier to ship, but it really only 3 ft long and about 6 inches wide."
2,"Pseudo-hip observations, an uneven collage of trivia","Extremely thin in both observation and inspiration, this celebration of the '60's bachelor male is like an extended booklet for one of the CD's in the Ultra-Lounge catalogue. Colorful, yes, and initially fun, but leaving no lasting impressions. I liked the paperback book covers, the hip records, the naughty napkins, but the book falls short on exploring drinks and music--which should've been the focus of the piece. Instead, we get a tiki section (with grass skirt ads!) and a chapter on the Beatnik movement. Bachelors in the 1960's were self-appointed suburban kings, not pot-smoking guys in berets who listened to Lenny Bruce (those were KIDS, not bachelor men). Therefore, the bongos and the hippies are just wasted space in what should've been a much more precise and engaging look at a specific genre."
2,Bubble Vapo-Blaster,"My 5 year old was disappointed, he thought it was an automatic bubble gun. Had to keep dipping the tip into bubble mixture to get it to work. For the price it wasn't really worth it."
3,Average,"(1) Stickers really hard to get off. Hard to fit into hitch without taking them off.(2) Ball mount does not have a universal catch to ensure the ball is locked when bolting it down... annoying.Other than that, it's fine. So it's average."
4,A worthy Planet Story,"THE Z RADIANT is a commenable and a promising first novel by Jessica Reisman -- well-written, solid, nuanced, and stocked (almost overstocked) with complexly interesting characters caught up in a complexly interesting event: Ingress, the once-every-26-years manifestation of a wormhole through which technologically advanced ""outsystem"" folk drop in on the otherwise isolated ""insystem"" ones. There are echoes of Ursula K. LeGuin in its depiction of provincial (but not simplistically conceived) insystem society, and Leigh Brackett probably would have admired the greed-and-vengeance-propelled plot and its attendant brace of tough, scary bad guys. There's also a passing reference to one Darkman Jones, surely kin to C.L. Moore's Northwest Smith and Brackett's John Eric Stark. This is a worthy Planet Story, even if the dustjacket art does stink out loud."
4,An intriguing book.....,"This is a story that takes you to a complex world, full of strange jungle like flora. The characters in the story are engaging. They serve as a frame of reference to draw the reader into this foreign world."
1,Safety Hazard,"Because the power strip is so narrow, it's possible to insert a plug incorrectly, with one prong inserted into the socket and the other prong hanging off the side of the power strip. This prong would be energized through the device/appliance, so you can get a shock from touching it. Also, the prong can touch the metal body of the power strip, creating a spark. I think a power socket should be designed so that this type of accident is physically impossible."
2,Very Uncomfortable Shoe,"Have small feet and narrow heels, ordered correct size of 4 1/2 so does not slip off my heel. However, insole padding does not cover entire insole and is practically nonexistant. Thus, this is a very uncomfortable shoe and pinches outer toes. Also, straps and buckles are so small that it is hard to insert strap in buckle let alone buckle it. Very disappointed, since I thought Naturalizer made comfortable shoes. Returned this shoe and ordered pair of Clarks' heels, which have excellent insole padding that covers entire insole and feels and looks great!"
4,Many color pictures,This book was a good introduction into art for me. The book had many color pictures with short but illuminative descriptions. For $15 it was a bargain. The book described not only the techniques and philosophy of the artists but also the surrounding circumstances.
2,Step-In Bird Feeder Pole from Amazon,"Easy to install, but wish the base prongs that go into the ground were further apart and longer. It's tippy and will need to have support wire to keep from bending in the wind."
5,PINGPINGPING!!!!,"I love this book! What a wonderful surprise of a story. Mordecai suffers from melanoia, which is the opposite of paranoia. He hears a ""ping"" in his head and feels compelled to follow people, and something good ends up happening. Mordecai hangs out at bars in the Monterey of the 70s, and his buddies are a collection of hippyesque misfits, all very colorful and tremendously endearing. His best homey is Buck, a Southern grifter who is constantly planning ""get rich quick"" schemes. One of my favorite lines by Buck is: ""Portuguese bullfighter, that's like marrying the Studebaker of bullfighters. Jane was always trying to be different, English accent and all, but she's as middleclass as a goddamn box of Cheerios.""The writing style is fresh, the adventures are all funny and engaging and real. The multiple characters have their day in the sun, there is a happy ending... What else do you want?This was a true discovery."
1,No opnion.,"I received the incorrect item, returned to sender and as of today have not received a refund or a the correct item IN THE HULL DEPTH FINDER!Gizmo for life sent and email regarding a refund, wonder where it is."
2,not quite there,"Having problems with the ""brains"" on this battery. Yes, it holds a charge a lot better than the old OEM battery it replaced.However, this replacement often does not sense that it is plugged in and should recharge - only a shutdown/restart wakes it up. So I've gone from rebooting my iBook once every several months to needing to reboot it after almost every unplugged session."
1,Not Again,"all vanilla powders are not the same, thought i could get away with it, but never will get this again, disappointing taste and a bit grainy too"
5,Excellent Vanilla Powder,"Husband wanted some vanilla powder to sprinkle on his morning lattes. Searched many stores and couldn't find a local supplier. Once again Amazon was a great source.He likes the flavor and the shaker works well. I like the size of the container (since it wasn't ordered to cook with we had no use for a large container or pound of bulk powder).In response to unhappy reviewer - nowhere does this product claim to be ""pure"" i.e. 100% vanilla. Two accurate descriptions mention the cane juice and the silica. Yes, cane juice is a form of sugar and therefore the source of the sweetness. Silica is a mineral commonly used as a flow agent for powders. (It is also an ingredient in many other items including glass, fiber optics, cosmetics, and supplements.) It is misleading to insinuate that silica=sand=glass.This is a good product and it is exactly what it claims to be, ""a vanilla powder that adds sweetness and enhances flavor."" Glad we found it."
1,buyer beware - counter fit products,These products are not authentic artec products. They are fakes. Would NOT purchase from this site again. They have not responded to my emails and have not refunded my $.
5,PreacherMike,oldy but a goody. Fondational truth for all pastors and mature Christians. This is basic but essential for building realities of life.
2,Yikes Watch Out for XP and This Scanner,I originally used this scanner with 98se and was very happy with it. We upgraded to XP and the problems began. First XP wouldn't recognize it when I tried to connect it to the same USB port that it worked happily with before. I tweaked and fiddled and read on the web about a lot of people who had the same problem.Hp help was no help. I didn't have any of the suspect hardware they mentioned. I downloaded updates and tried to reset the compatibility. Nothing worked. So I connected it with the parallel cable. It now works but o-h s-o-o s-l-o-o-o-w-l-y.So I went from being fairly happy with this beast to being quite unhappy.
4,Four and a half stars from my kids,"This three-cd set of kid-friendly jazz is popular in my household (one jazz fan adult, one jazz tolerant adult, and boys 4.5 and 2.5). Each cd is a bit over 40 minutes long, and there's nothing I don't mind listening many times (except for What A Wonderful World, which has been pretty present in our home for over a year thanks to Madagascar). I'm writing mostly to note that there is a large overlap betweenJazz for Kids: Sing Clap Wiggle & Shakeand this - about 3/4 of the former's songs are here - so you might consider getting this set, esp. as the other one has less than 30 minutes of music. On the other hand Sing Clap etc. has Old MacDonald, The Red Red Robin, and a Blossom Dearie Doop Doo De Doop, each of which someone in my household really likes. When I got this there was an excellent price on a new copy from an Amazon seller so I'm happy despite the overlap."
3,Works well,"it's not the best ive used, but for the price it does work good. you get what you pay for with any supplements.. cheaper isn't better"
5,Another stunning classic,"Along with ""In The Heart Of The Heart Country"" by Firetown, this is one of the all time great records. Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Steely Dan and a bit of Neil Young....just extraordinary. Much better remastered sound than the Firetown. Wounded Bird Records are life savers. Great harmonies and the great Jim Gordon on drums...WOW."
4,Great gift ! Fun trivia & game.,"I bought this game for my nephew's 6th birthday and he loves it. One of the things I really liked about the game was that it included dinosaur trivia, and my nephew really liked that too. Of course he loves it when the dinosaur ""ghost"" roars, so the pieces that were harder to remove did not frustrate him. Being that he has a younger brother (2) we immediately made a rule that the bones need to be put back in that game before it is put away, this not only prevented little fingers from picking up stray pieces to eat but has also helped to keep any the parts from getting lost."
3,helpful and clear.,I enjoyed this guide for the easy to find information and easy to read maps. It gave good hike descriptions and the list of spotlighted activites was right on target. I do use this regularly to create my plans for the park. This did lack the personal touch that I found in some other references and found myself picking up other guides to go with the maps in this book. The Moon guide was by far my favorite. But do check it out if your going to Yosemite. More information is always better.
5,Excellent Skillet,"HIgh recommended cookware and worth the extra money - in this case you absolutely get what you pay for! Much better value than ridiculously expensive Le Creuset cookware but with the same performance. Yes, it is heavy but that translates into a skillet you can count on for edge-to-edge even heating! Enamel coating is a big plus and better, in my opinion, than having non-coated cast iron that requires seasoning and is very easy to clean."
2,I hate this skillet,"We bought this after buying a glass top range (not supposed to use cast iron skillets on it) and we are very disappointed with it. I avoid using it. It is heavy and the enamel chips easily. Also seems to never come clean. As for cooking with it, I am not impressed. Even with seasoning it food sticks. I would definitely NOT recommend purchasing this skillet."
3,Monster Pan,"I bought this pan for my wife, so that, she could cook on a healthy non-teflon coated surface. Even though it cooks well, is fairly easy to clean, and is a great quality product, she is only 5' 2"" and 130 lbs. She says, she has to use two hands to pick it up and struggle move it. It's just too heavy. Maybe there is some way they could lighten it up..."
5,GREAT BOOK ABOUT HOW ARABE ARE BRUTAL OVER THE BERBER,"The Arab culture is brutal. No right for the Berber people. Berber people are the native habitant of Algeria , but the Arab , Kill them,, destroy the house, kill all the militants like Matoub Lounes, the son of Ferhat Mhenni (from the MAK : Liberation movement for the Berber region of Kabylia.The Arab are forcing Berber to speak Arabic only Arabic and believe me if you are under any Arab domination you are in a Big trouble.."
1,Totally lame release!,"I loved Aries Spears' other release, ""I ain't scared"" so I bought this. Don't. There's less than half an hour of material and almost none of it is funny. Spears' does his great imitations of DMX, LL cool J, etc. but they are not funny. There are just a few poor quality recordings of sessions with Spears on a radio show pretending to be a rap star and tricking callers into auditioning their music and a couple of recordings where Spears calls into a radio show pretending to be a rap star.This release would be tolerable as a bonus track for a comedy CD but is totally unacceptable as a stand alone release. Save your money and avoid!!!"
4,All Four Chairs Included,"I had a rehearsal of a reading for two new plays in my new apartment and I had no furniture. I liked how these looked but I was really wary of the reviews from 2008 saying there was only a single $100 chair rather than four.I bought the chairs along with four pads (Kennedy Home Collections Faux Leather Tufted Chair Pad - Black).All four chairs arrived and when I put the padding on, one of the actors referred to it as ""one of the comfortable chairs.""They come fully assembled and ready to use -- except the packaging wraps the chairs tightly together with tough plastic bands, so make sure you have scissors or a knife handy."
5,the best DC season,"who doesn't love Joey and Pacey? this is definitely the best DC season out there, it's nice to see Joey wasn't just hanging around for dawson, this season is all about change of plot, come on now, I'm sure DC fans were bored with the whole joey and dawson relationship on the past 3 season. great memorable season."
4,"Slow, but dependable. Ink hard to find.",I bought the 2250 after my second Epson went south. The Color 600 needed so many repairs that I gave up. Then the Color 740 went south. I just needed a printer to do odd jobs since my wife's computer has a good HP. The only problem is that nobody who carries the printer seems to have the ink cartridges. That's not good planning from Apollo. Print quality is great for such an inexpensive printer. Just don't expect that 10 page document to finish by dinnertime.
4,Excelente!,"Excelente producto, muy buena calidad tal y como es descrito y las imagenes tambien, muy buena compra por el precio indicado, ademas llego justo cuando estaba pactado por el vendedor. Buena compra"
3,Track Listing,1. Going Out Of My Head (Twisted Dog Radio Edit)3:362. Going Out Of My Head (Twisted Dog Mix) 6:383. Going Out Of My Head (Out Of My Dub) 5:114. Going Out Of My Head (NY Club Mix) 7:555. Going Out Of My Head (Krazy For Dub) 5:59
1,Order damaged & incomplete.,I received my order of Bostitch brad nails. It was supposed to be a box of 3000 brads. The box came torn up and the brads broken up. The box only contained 1/3 of the brads with the rest missing. Tried to contact them by phone only got a recording.
2,Not worth reading,"I read the book and tried to use the system but it wasn't very useful. One will won't find many ""plays"" with this approach."
3,Not as pictured!!,Two issues with this ring;1.The setting is not the same!!2.Quality is lower then promised!! (color is fine clarity was the problem)I spoke with the seller about both of these issues and they were aware of the different setting. (Blamed is on the photographer?? That's a good one.) The quality issue still bothers me and the real setting has sharp edges so it scratches/dents easily. All and all I did not hate the ring enough to have my boyfriend return it but would not buy it again.
2,A Disney Disappointment,"Seems as though this CD is lacking in someway. Although the ""Tapestry of Nations,"" is nicely done, I would still save the money for the actual trip to Walt Disney World. The live 2000 celebration is a must see though."
5,memorable,"After having blown off the carribean isle of Nevus by hurricaine Lenny late 1999, my family and I had ventured to Disney world. What a fortunate experience was to be had...the millenium was rapidly approaching and Disney/ EPCOT had this show, ""Millenium Celebration"". My kids were younger back then and we all witnessed it. The music, the parade, and the atmosphere were electrifying. It was almost a religious experience without sounding corny. ""Reflections of Earth"", ""We Go On"" and ""Tapestry of Nations"" gave hope, inspiration, and wonder. If the whole world had seen this show, the world would be a much better place..."
2,Very disappointing,"I seem to be alone in my opinion, but this is not a great CD. I love B.B. King and I love Louis Jordan, but not this CD. Great concept, poorly executed. There are much better choices from both.Although the blues cuts are stronger than the jump cuts, they just are not up to the standards of the great BBK albums. There are not cuts that makes we want to own this CD."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I bought this for my daughter since she was using it in her school and she loved the program. This is an old copy from 10 years ago. I could not even find an old PC with 256 colors to run the software. I finally got a hold of talkingfingers.com. They were nice enough to send me the latest version of the software and give me a 20% discount when i told them I had bought this. This is old junk for use with windows 98. Stay away.
2,not good,"the cd seems to play, and although this might be my fault it was too old to play on any computer i could gain access too. bought to relive a childhood game, but it appears that game will have to remain in the past."
4,Funny stuff!,"Solid comedy CD - good enough to recommend. His imitations are very strong, and he has a good comic delivery. Disc 1 is from a standup performance, and it comes across well on the CD. Disc 2 is prank phone calls. Disc 2 is a bit uneven, with some calls being funny as hell and some going far too long.Overall a very good set."
1,No Autograph.s,No Autograph's were in the box and after alot of emails to the seller and the toy company I still have no autograph's and that is now 3 months ago since I bought them.
2,O Jerusalem or How I Saw the Holy Land by Foot,"After loving the first three Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell mysteries, I was terribly disappointed by THE MOOR, which I never even finished. I am halfway through O JERUSALEM and doubt that I will finish it either. I understand that Laurie King is a biblical scholar interested in the Holy Land. She used this knowledge to advantage in A LETTER TO MARY. However, if this is where her heart is, she needs to turn to non-fiction writing. O JERUSALEM is an endless travelogue of the Holy Land in the early 20th century. The mystery is so thin as to be non-existent. While I find the descriptions somewhat interesting, I did not buy a history and/or travel guide to the Holy Land. I purchased the book thinking I was buying a Sherlock Holmes/Mary Russell MYSTERY. I am afraid I have bought my last Laurie R. King hardcover book."
5,The book was marvelously detailed and cleverly plotted.,"This was probably my favourite of the Laurie King novels, aside from The Beekeeper's Apprentice. The ""travelogue"" aspects of the novel noted by another reviewer were there, but I didn't find them tedious at all. They were very interesting and added realism to the story. I've found myself poring over WWI and Jerusalem books, trying to learn more about the events and the ancient city. King's scholarship is a wonderful bonus in the novel, I think, helping to educate me in the most pleasant way. The Holmes/Russell relationship is beautifully developed, too, though I know that Holmes purists find that relationship too difficult to fathom. I'm not a Holmes purist, but rather a lover of Holmes stories, so that anything good that happens to him pleases me. Russell is good for him and he for her, as this novel so delightfully proves."
5,wonderful book,This is a wonderful book I sent as a Christmas gift. I felt sure my cousin would enjoy it.
1,A Boring Mishmash,I ordinarilly admire Laurie R. King's books. I have read all of them to date and just don't understand this one. I admit that I prefer her Kate Martinelli series to her Mary Russell series but this book just defeated me. There is much to be admired in the Mary Russell series but not this book. Forget it!
3,OK but not as pictured,"Product came quickly but box was in tatters when it arrived.There was no ball mount, as pictured, so the photo is misleading, as i chose this because I hoped it came as shown.Also the holes were about 1 inch too close together for the car's frame so I had to use big hammer to bash the plates apart. This may have been from UPS dropping the item on it's end too many times.Overall good hitch, just not as shown"
4,dodge caravan,"all parts delivered, everything you need to mount. Best performed with a lift. ie in a shop. Lying on back for mate-ups is tricky."
1,BAD DONT BUY,"I USED EVERY BOTTLE , THE WHOLE BOTTLE AT TIMES SMELLS FOR1-2 MIN. I HAVE FOUND ALLBRANDS BREEZE FRANGRANCES THE BEST TELL THEM LYNN SENT YOU LYNN W FROM LOUISIANA IM GOING TO CALL AMAZON MAYBE IT WAS A BAD BATCH LOVE AMAZON MAYBE THEY WILL MAKE THIS RIGHT"
3,"Say, Sing & Sign Songs Vol. 1","Strictly instructional. Not for entertainment. Songs: Bingo, Jingle Bells, One Little, Two Little-Halloween, Home on the Range, Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, Earth, Earth, Earth. I wish there were more songs."
3,Could be brighter,"I bought this light pack because it claimed to be bright and priced competitively. I found the Bike Beamer light to be not as bright as expected. The rear blinky light does the job as expected.For the price, this is an ok product. Don't expect to light up the world with this product."
4,Good value set,"Appears to be pretty good quality. Nice for commuting in a city. The headlight would be bright enough if it were really dark in a pinch- but I wouldn't make a habit of it if you travel on busy roads. Not reccomeneded for use off road.The headlight does flash (or remain on) which I prefer for my use; but the thing I dont understand is for the tail light, the first click is steady on, while for the headlight the first click is flashing. Minor gripe. Addtional mounting options would be nice, but I got these to work fine."
3,Caring,"This was not my favorite Christie Ridgway book. I enjoyed it and it was a quick read, but not my favorite.I liked Nash and Eve and thought they had good chemistry. And I really enjoyed the relationship between Jemima and the older actor staying in the bungalow next door.The mafia angle didn't intrigue me and felt a little forced. Overall, I liked this book; as always it was well-written and entertaining."
3,Shortchanged on the ending,"Another book without an ending, atleast one that I found satisfying, so that gets 3 stars. The story as a whole, 4 stars, glad to read the sequel, will be looking for the next one so I can have some closure (ha)."
4,Catherine's Mommy,"While this is a great thermometer, make sure you are careful when putting the battery in. The first one I bought broke as soon as I inserted the battery because there was a defect on the positively charged side. The metal holder itself broke right off. I was very disappointed because I had just boughten the thing and I was so close to my due date that I didn't want to make the trip out to town again to return it. Other then that, the thermometer has been worth the expense because it's readings are accurate, it's easy to use, and comes highly recommended by most pediatricians."
5,FL opinion,"I registered and received the TemporalScanner for my baby shower. I did alot of research on this product to ensure I was getting a good quality, accurate thermometer. As a first-time mom and a nurse, it was imperative for me to have accuracy. This was one of the first items I tore out of the box to play with. Even though baby is not here yet, I tried it on everyone at home numerous times and was completely satisfied with the exact reading of each person no matter how many times I tried to 'trick' it. I would have to say this product far outweighs any others out there, i.e. ear, axillary and even rectal. It is convenient, easy and accurate. What else could you ask for?"
2,Not a good choice from my experience,"My daughter was born in Nov 2002 and we've used this to take her temperature many times. The readings aren't that far off, but the circular head is sometimes very hard to scan across a moving child's forehead. Not only is it difficult to get the head of the monitor to follow the child's forehead in a straight manner, it is a hard surface and I can only imagine it doesn't feel great to the baby. I tried it on myself and it wasn't comfortable. I think I'll stick to the armpit/rectal thermometer."
4,Grandfather,I bought this item for my new granddaughter. She is only 8 months old and you know how hard it is to get them to stay still long enough to get a good reading on their temperature. This really did the trick and is very accurate. I recommend it for the whole family.
4,Great!,"This thermometer is the way to go. It is expensive, but what clinched the deal for me is that my pediatrician uses a temporal scanner and says they are extremely accurate (just like this one claims to be). We've used it on ourselves and it's great and so easy. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect rating is b/c it actually has been somewhat tricky at times to get a perfect reading on our baby b/c she wouldn't hold her little head still (she's 2 months old). However, you can stick the thermometer behind her ear lobe on her neck and take it that way too. Good buy and we're glad we bought it~ UPDATE: She's now 8 months old and we've used it a lot more in the last 6 months! The way to go for sure! It is always accurate and we even use it on ourselves. My baby smiles and chuckles when we use it b/c it has a red light on it and makes a beep when it goes over her forehead! Worth the money!"
3,OK movie,"I had never seen it before but I saw it had Aldo Ray and Andrew Prine, it has a lot of T&A in it and the plot is good I enjoyed it"
4,New album is more spiritual and heavy-hearted,"I only listened to the album twice and already it has impressed me. The lyrics are absorbing and hypnotic, the music's amazing, and the melding of different styles is captivating. A really heavy sound combines with something much deeper than standard popular songs. This is my third Live album (Throwing Copper, Secret Samadhi) and it may not be as good as the other two, but it absolutely holds its own among all other rock albums. Definitely worth getting. This is actually the first time I bought an album the day after it was released without hearing any of the songs beforehand. I'm very impressed."
4,"Not the best, close to it though","The album was good. Certain songs like Dolphin's Cry and Sun are easily noticable. The truth is, every song was very good and only when you reach certain parts does the package lose it's sheen. Specifically the out of place string intstrument on the distance and the insertion of the piano on Sun.In the end, the album's one of the better ones released this year. It's an awesome album, but there are times that you are jarred out of the song.If you like Live, you'll like this CD. Those who don't will immediately see the miniscule flaws and turn away."
4,This is a truly beautiful record.,"I have 1 word to describe this record: remarkable. I never even liked Live until ""The Distance to Here"" was released,and I'm glad I found out about this cd. The lyrics are of pure genious, matched up with great vocals and playing, it makes a wonderful cd. I'm pretty picky about what I listen to so if I like this cd, you should go out and buy it. I could blab on & on about this record (but I won't). :)"
5,The Distance is Well-Traveled,"I first picked up this album for the amazing first single, ""The Dolphin's Cry"". I had fallen in love with this song from the first listen, and I was anxious to hear the rest of the album. After one or two listens, I was positively hooked. The continuing theme of love and its effect on life carries the album throughout. My personal favorite tracks: the dramatic ""Sun"", the passionate (yet slightly overly metaphorical) ""Meltdown"", the absolutely gorgeous ""Dance With You"", and a song that is destined to become a Live classic, ""Run to the Water"". I had heard Live's classic Throwing Copper as well as the disappointing Secret Samadhi prior to this, and this album topped both of them easily. I highly reccomend this album to fans of passionate, beautiful music."
5,One of Live's best,"If you liked Throwing Copper, you will love this. Take my advise, it is worth it!"
3,Just OK!,"This album is OK, but not nearly as good as Throwing Copper. Some songs are annoying and I have to skip through them. It doesn't even sound like the same band."
3,Not good Live,"I used to love Live. I still love their first three cd's. But this one just isn't very good in my opinion. The songs don't have good beats. They're not very catchy. I can't find myself singing along to any of them. And they all start to sound alike, especially on repeat listens. Check out their earlier albums if you want to hear some truly great music, especially Mental Jewelry."
5,GREATNESS,"This CD is must buy for ANYONE. I was never a fan of Live, but I listened to this twice and now I'm a fan! MUST BUY!"
3,Great individual songs.......not a great album,"Some of the songs here are the best that live have ever written. The only dillema is that the album itself seems quite boring to me. If you tak it apart one by one like a puzzle, and look at each piece each, you would say, WoW, these are some truly beautiful pieces. But when you put them back together you would create an abstract and boring puzzle. Ok...not the best analogy, but the easiest way to describe my feelings. I wish I could say that I love this cd, but I just can't. It's too much at one time. And it makes me bored. The overtones seem to be all the same, although the songs aren't that similar. They just give me the same feeling as the next. You might not feel this way, but I just want to warn some. It is worth the money if you consider that you are getting some great individual songs here, but not if you wanted something to listen to all the way through."
5,Completely awesome,"This cd is great! The lyrics are completely out of this world! A very honest cd, telling the story of love and life. Ed Kowalczyk's throaty, sexy voice adds a lot to the cd, and the songs are the type you can listen to quite a bit without getting bored. I LOVE this cd, and I would recommend it to anybody who likes alternative music that has a deeper message than the usual songs. Peace out!"
2,"Ok, 2 and a half","All throughout the album, I was thinking to myself: ""God, he sounds like he's too close to the mic."" The Christian undertones can get a bit weepy at times as well, and often the words don't make much sense. But turn down his voice and up the music, and you have a decent album."
4,Cute lamp with multiple features,"My 6 year old really likes this lamp which comes with many features combined--light, alarm clock, and radio. This helps to conserve space as well as teach her how to operate each item. It would be nice if it coordinated better with the Bratz bedding and if the features were more accessible."
4,Cute and Functional,"Cute and works great a radio, alarm clock and lamp. Everything she needs in one, so it does not take up all kinds of space in her room. It's great."
2,It could've been better for the price,"When I received the toy, the one of the hinges on the lap shade was broke. The alarm clock does not work, you cannot see the clock while the lamp is on and the shade is very top heavy so it falls over alot, esp if u bump it a tiny bit. Definitely not worth 30 bucks but my daughter loves it."
2,This lamp makes me vomit!,"Why on earth MGA did you create this rotten lamp? I hate it! I hate it! I can't even fit it on my bedside table. This teacher....sorry. Onto this lamp again. I don't like it at all and seriously, it makes ME [...]Thank you for reading."
3,"Feels smooth, not greasy","I am 27 and my skin is not too oily. If anything, it's occasionally on the dry side. My daily face care routine involves an SPF 15 moisturizer in the morning and this cream at night. I love the way this cream feels. It does not go on too greasy, and I do notice a difference in the way my skin feels the following morning when I have not used this product. I do think, however, that any delay in wrinkles might most likely be due to using a light sun block every day; I think that's the important step. In any case, I like how this cream feels and will continue to use it for that benefit."
5,out of this world,"I`ve always been searching for speed exersice for lead guitar & i dont think i have ever seen better than this book , you cant imagine what these exersices can do with your fingers speed. excellent for beginners to advanced lead guitar players believe me you dont know what your missing"
5,Must have book,"I had this book back when it came with a cassette tape. Unfortunately, I did not use it back then. I have been playing guitar on and off for 20 years more off for the last 10, but 20 none the less. I picked this book up, and have been going through it daily for the past month. My skills have soared tremendously it is almost unreal. I am playing some yngwie malmsteen lines with ease, john pettruci(no problem), jason becker... etc... I wish I would have actually utilized this book when I had it 15 years ago. There is no telling what kind of skills I would have now. I am using this along with guitar aerobics (another very good book). Guitar aerobics covers some areas where this book does not much. Like rythym. Pair these two books together, and practice daily for no less than 1 hr on these materials and you will be surprised how far you come in a little amount of time."
4,Great for 2yo and 4yo boys,"We are new 'Little Einsteins' converts. What a nice little show, with little art and music learning points in each one. My boys absolutely love them, even my 2 year old (all he cares about is trucks, trains, and cars and won't look up otherwise)will sit an watch it and sing the songs afterwards. This one is especially popular in our house. The volcano in one episode scares my older child slightly, but more of an adventure scene than a scary scene. A+!!!"
3,Not a bad CD,"If you're looking for something interesting this Christmas, I'd recommend this CD. At the very least, the always amusing Ben Folds will have you laughing with ""Bizzare Christmas Incident"", about a little mishap with Santa."
2,"I bought this album for ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen""","I couldn't find ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" by the Barenaked Ladies anywhere else, so I just purchased the whole CD. That was a waste of money because I could have just downloaded one song. The rest of the album is blah."
2,de gustibus non disputandum est,"Phrases like 'cult classic' and 'sci-fi classic' inevitably lead to purchases and then to questions: why is this movie a classic, what am I missing. Sadly, the answers to these two questions are no and nothing. The premise of the movie is what happens when dreams come true -- as might be expected, little good although everything turns out pretty well for our hero in the end. My problems with the movie are several: the story-line is lame and there is no real narrative drive -- if the movie had simply been on tv, I am sure I would have bailed-out during a commercial; the acting is poor -- some of the major players would have difficulty winning parts at good drama schools; and, finally, the film is obviously a low-budget, made-for-tv film that is poorly produced. Not recommended."
4,The Lathe of Heaven,"I happened to see this movie on PBS shortly after moving to Dallas in 1979. At that time, absolutely nothing was opened in the downtown area on the weekends. Especially on Sundays, walking around the downtown area was very ""Twilight Zone."" It was like you were in a world where 1/3 of the population had died over night. I can't wait to see this movie again. My wife and I are big movie buffs, and she's never even heard of it. The though of it soon being released on VHS has me up at 3am on a Monday night."
3,A-Okay. Nothing Special,"Heats up my small bedroom very good after I've turned down the furnace for the night.Not so great for larger rooms in my house or my garage in very cold weather unless standing directly in front of it all of the time.So in other words,to take the chill out of a small enclosed place,this will do the job. For larger rooms or in very cold temperatures, you'll probably need something bigger with more BTU's ."
5,Unbelievable! Never would have guessed...,"this little guy could do as much as it does.When I first plugged it in, I thought I had been duped by the 'Stanley' name and rugged-look for the design. There was very little noise or air movement. I figured I was going to have to return it the next day.Good thing I decided to leave it plugged in overnight and see if there was any hope.In -30 degree (That's negative 30 for all of you below the tundra of North Dakota) weather outside, this guy heated a one-car garage with 12 foot ceilings to a good 30degrees above zero (60 degrees in less than 14 hours). I just about fell over! I could not believe the job it had done!I have only had the unit for 5 days now. It has run pretty constant and the unit is very cool to the touch. I do not know how this thing does what it does; but, I am thoroughly impressed!!So, if you need a 120 volt, plug-in heater to get you out of the house and working in the garage - this is your guy.Simply, unbelievable!"
2,Has no industrial value,Fan is to weak for any other than small room home use. But theres better models for that so I say boo.
4,Better than most,"I think think unit heats very well in a 14 x 10 room,I would not suggest trying to use it in anything bigger !"
1,Can't heat under cold conditions,"The Stanley 675900 Pro-Cramic can not heat up a small room such as 7 X 9 foot. At -5C it's fair, at -10C its poor and at -15 or lower it's just terrible. So if you live where it can get to those and lower temperatures the Stanley 675900C isn't effective at all. DO not spend your bucks on it there are other ceramic heateres that cost way less and with teh same specs as the 675990C has and can heat up the above space when it's -35C."
4,Great Book,"I met the author when I bought the book. He seemed to be a nice guy, that's the reason I bought it. I'm glad I did. I read the book in about three days. Looking forward to the next one."
3,Incomplete book,Enjoyed reading this novel until it was rudely cut short about two thirds of the way through. I could no longer turn the page to continue. Quite disappointing although at the cost of 0.0 I could not complain too loudly... This is the first time this has happened to a book received from Amazon.
1,"wrong logo on it,","in picture shows the old Max Factor logo and when I got the product it has the new logo, not what I was expecting"
5,Awesome blu-ray,"This is one of those rare movies, that it is a easy movie to watch, aside from it being a great movie technically. The blu-ray is awesome, movie does not feel ""dated"" in anyway."
3,"Uhm... it was ok, but the first EP was a lot better","When i first seen it, i grabed it up Not thinkinking how much it cost. The first CD the put out, (More like a promo) was 100% better. But I can say The song Full Devil Jacket (track 5) Is great. So if your thinking about buying it, it is good, but try to find the promo."
1,Feist has past his prime...,"It is a shame that Feist continues to let his readers down. After the Riftwar and Serpentwar sagas, I guess there was no place to go but down. I have read both sagas about 5 times and you could not pay me to read the conclave trilogy again. This trilogy appears to be writtin in 3 hours much like a bad sequel to a great movie. Tal Hawkins in the first book was a different spin and mildely entertaining, but this book is supposed to be the setup to a great finish, not a decent start to a painful conclusion. The last 2 books were so lackluster that I found it difficult to even finish them. Mr. Feist...please take a vacation and maybe you will get your swing back."
3,Fair to Midkemia,"This read more like a book 1 or 2 of a series than a final book. Why not make this book the beginning of the Darkwar trilogy? I realized by the middle of the book that there was no way of any sort of conclusion to this ""evil"" that was uncovered. Towards the end of it, they didn't really even know what was going on. The book ends with a whimper trying to hook you into reading the next series. This book was a real disappointment plot wise when compared to the first two books.This being said, the redemption of Kaspar was quite interesting. It might have been more interesting to play more on the internal battle of the realization of his life of iniquity versus who he was before his being coopted into evil plans. Focusing more on the conflict between his thirst for revenge and having to rely on the target of his revenge to solve his dilemma (which barely is addressed).Overall is was a decent read but not up to the level of past Feist books."
1,What a stinker winker!,"Ok...this toy really stunk! The text was faded all the time, the games never work, and if you turn the organizer off, all of your game scores went away! I would NOT recommend this toy too ANYONE unless you want to waste your money! This is coming from a 13 year old girl who HATES this.....THING!"
1,A video game in board game form--too complicated and boring,"I'd heard great things about this game from my son, so we finally ordered it. After plowing through countless rules and instructions and trying several times to play the game, I finally got the hang of it. Unfortunately, all that work wasn't worth it--this is fundamentally a boring game, and the fact that a random carrot determines the winner at the end makes things even worse. I found all the cards and rules needlessly complex and irritating--the game is very much like a video game (with endless rules, twists, flukes, etc.) in board form. My husband tried playing too and gave up. Not worth it, especially considering all the extra sets the company wants you to buy."
4,Killer Bunnies is Killer,"Despite the age recommendation of 12 and up, my 10 yr old LOVES this game. Game play is fairly simple but the strategy can be interesting. It is possible to play and win without killing anyone else's bunnies (the pacifist strategy). Or, you can detonate a nuclear explosion and wipe out everyone's bunnies (annihilate and rebuild strategy). And anything in between. The random aspect of not knowing which carrot is the magic carrot until the very end (and it changes with each time you play) helps to balance things - you may have all but one carrot and half a dozen bunnies and another player may have just one carrot and one bunny, and they can still win the game. The cards are a thick, laminated stock, thicker than standard playing cards, so they seem to be standing up well to repeated shufflings."
5,FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!,"Killer Bunnies is AWESOME!!!! It is entertaining and silly...and just plain fun to play!! I have already bought the next expansion kit, and cannot wait to get more of them. My whole family loves this game too. It has quickly become the goto game of choice for us all! The cards are of great quality (thicker and glossier than regular playing cards), the graphics are funny, and the imagination of the designers is second to none."
5,On the book,The book came on time and great condition but the only reason i returned it was only because it didn't come with the mymathlab which i really needed. i felt it would be too much money to purchase the book and have to purchase the mymathlab code separtely.Over all that was my only problem.As for amazon they handled my return with no problems or hassle.
5,MOM OF A 9TH GRADER,"This was an excellent book. My child whipped thru the book in three months getting an ""A"" in class. The word problems were the best because it really made him hone his analytical skills. I highly recommend the book."
2,Weak And Unfocused,"The main problem here is that Jim Derogatis tries to be too inclusive when it comes to what artists are psychedelic, leaving the less informed reader totally confused about a clear definition of the genre. The inclusion of fairly traditional progressive rock, like Genesis and Yes, which is really sort of ""post psychedelic"" is inappropriate, as are the hip hop and techno artists which he spends way too much time on. Some important indie and underground ""real"" psych artists like The Bevis Frond, are given just a token mention and passed off as trivial, or not included at all (example :The Groundhogs,May Blitz, George Brigman, Ronald Warren Ganderton). Artists like Pink Floyd and The Grateful Dead are better documented in works that have been solely devoted to them. If you are a psych collector, you'll dismiss this book as I did"
4,A little traveling music...,"There's only way to really appreciate this music: Listen to it in your car. Pick a starlit night, go to your nearest winding, two-lane highway, pop in the soundtrack, and shift into warp drive. Be sure you take your cell phone. You may need it to find your way back!LEB"
3,Incomplete Soundtrack,"I don't know if anyone realized, but this soundtrack is missing several pieces from the movie--just watch the movie and you'll know the ones that were left out. Thus this isn't an ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"". The same thing was done with the Star Trek 3 soundtrack. Will James Horner ever bring out the complete ones? Who knows?***************Review update -- Sept. 2010I am pleased to discover the expanded score has recently been released. FINALLY after 28 years they finally did it! It can be found at MovieMusic[dot]com -- search for 'Star Trek II' & select the 'expanded' choice. Enjoy!"
4,Hilarious!,"I am a 16 year old girl and I am a HUGE Broadway fan. This is the first cababret album I've heard (I dont even know what cabaret is exactly) but I heard it not knowing what to expect and I was cracking up at every song! Especially ""The Babysitters Here"" It was so true! I'm running right out to get it! Its one of those albums that just put you in a good mood and put a smile on your face."
5,outstanding,"I love this cd. I have always enjoyed all the albums that Melissa has put out, and I do enjoy her albums because there is not just one good song the whole album is fantastic. Every song is full of meaning and emotion. I can't wait til her next one already."
4,Melissa becomes more of an artist,"This album, Breakdown, finally takes advantage of Melissa's great talent. The first song, ""Breakdown,"" gets the album off to a great start with its rolling guitar. That song, and ""Enough Of Me"" have those great Etheridgian choruses that we come to expect from her. I'm glad that she didn't clutter the verse parts - you can hear her voice more clearly. There is definitely tons of passion on the album, especially on the ""Enough Of Me"" song. ""Into The Dark,"" ""Scarecrow,"" ""My Lover,"" and ""Mama I'm Strange"" all chart new territory for Melissa, and she is ready for the challenge. ""Angels Will Fall"" is a bit of a generic blues rocker, and ""How Would I Know"" is a bit bland, but ""Truth Of The Heart"" is a gem. Breakdown is definitely worth buying."
2,Tell me it ain't so!,"Other than letting it play, this CD left me with the only option of hitting the ""stop"" button and replacing it with one of her past stellar performances. As an avid fan, ""Complete disappointment"" is the only way I can describe this album. Except for maybe two tracks, ""Breakdown"" contains none of her usual powerful, passionate lyrics and riffs that are the heart and soul of her other albums. My advice: stick with any of her past CDs and leave this one alone."
2,What is this chick mad about,Sounds like she is really mad about something. Leaves the impression that she is queer or something. Long live Britany Spears
2,just the usual,"Don't get me wrong--I love Melissa. But this album is pretty much like white bread to me. No real surprises. Even lyrically, I can guess what the next line is going to be. This album is not bad, but its just very unexciting. I was really looking forward to the Matthew Shepard song (Scarecrow), but I didn't even think that had too much insight. Its still kinda pretty to listen to, though, if that's what you're looking for."
4,Be very very careful!,"Breakdown was a mess to some people. I thought so myself at first. Although musically, the songs on this album don't connect with anyone and they definitely are not very catchy, you might want to buy this album for the lyrics alone. This is Melissa at her finest in this respect. I listened to this album once and did not listent to it for about a year. I read a review on it where it talked about the writing and how honest she was. After listening to it again I was blown away. I was a little surprised at myself for not noticing that. YOu sometimes have to remember that some of the best writing out there was not always accompanied by perfect melodies. Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan are prime exmples."
4,almost as good as debut,"This CD is almost as good as her 1st CD - which is the best one! Why it took so long for her to become popular is beyond me, this CD returns to those pre-commercial days, however. EXCELLENT"
2,Too out of date..three years old..to be accurate,Save money if you want to buy this three year old guide and buy it direct from the publisher in the Amazon auction section where he offers it for only 12.00 which is fair since it is out of date material..for the up to date prices try the Official Price Guide that is published by the Autograph Collector magazine..who better to know the real skinny on prices then the top magazine in the field.
4,Good English,"This is a good album with a country/blues/folk mix. The songs are unique and tell stories. A few songs are a bit slow, but appropriate to the type of music. Robin makes the songs her own. This album is definitely not generic and is worth a listen."
3,"Interesting, but not DK's best","If you're used to DK's exceptional quality for children's books, you might be disappointed with this one. It has some good photos and interesting info, but is short and feels incomplete...and just not up to the normal high standard for DK books."
2,Your book has no answer key to the practice questions,"to whom it may concern, this book is of little value when you can not check your work do to the fact it has no answer key for the practical exercises. If you have an answer key can you please provide at least the 1st four chapters. Thank you. Paines@emh10.bliss.army.mil"
5,Great foot rest.,"I was very pleased with this foot rest from the first time I used it. I seems to be sturdy made, easy to set up and adjust, looks great, and is comfortable. It has several height adjustments and is tilted about right. The only thing to watch is that the metal on the bottom is a little sharp when it is closed. You may need to be careful when you pack it for transportation. For the price and quality, I couldn't ask for more."
5,Love it. Something so simple has improved my posture and playing.,The best item at a reasonable price. This has helped me improve my posture and my playing. A must have for any guitarist!!
2,Do not buy a hype!,"This is another truly bad book with a lot of hype just like Sun's publishing. There is a lot of hype about PrenHall and Sun Soft but those publishers are no better than any other. How do you come to 1400 pages? Well if you write 5 pages in a typeset which could be one page in any other book. The book contains one of the worst organized indices I've seen in a long time and most of the time, instead of exemplifying the matter dissolves into technical blabber. The good question is which serious programmer would have a need for this book? There are many more comprehensive books on the market on any of the topics of this book, also written in a more readable manner than this one. Don't waste a penny on this book, it is not worthy one. For those who need tutorial, avoid this book, there are faster and more concrete books around."
2,Superceded by better books,"Agreed that Marty Hall knows how to write and produces great books. Knowing this, I can heartily recommend his more recent ""More Servlets and JSPs"" as it provides more relevant up to date information. For the Java side of things, this offers the most bang for your buck.When this book first came out, it was attempting to cover the gamut of web development technology, and tried to go from CGI up through JSPs and the coverage was ultimately spotty. For a more focused approach to servlets and JSPs, read Hall's later books. For a better historical perspective on the evolution of web programming, look at ""Web Application Architecture - Principles, Protocols and Practices"" by Leon Shklar and Richard Rosen."
3,"Good music, dorky concept","Nearly all of this album has good music and supremely executed jams, however I can't get over the dorky concept. Why would anyone create such wonderful music around the most absurd lyrics?This is a prime example of how good music can't become high art because of a terrible concept. Under more inspired circumstances (and a better singer) I can see Glass Hammer as being somewhat important."
5,"Exactly what I was looking for, and exactly as advertised.","This product does exactly what I wanted. I have it in my spice cupboard now, and I no longer have to empty the cupboard to find a particular bottle."
3,New Isn't Always Improved,"The Dymo LP350 does some things the LP300 didn't - vertical and decorative type - but doesn't do some of the basic things nearly as well as the predecessor. The LP300 had a single font, a standard sans-serif typeface, but the user could tweak the sizes endlessly within the confines of the tape size. The LP350 has more fonts, but the sizes are far more limited. I prefer the former."
2,Forget this game if you want to solo,"First get used to waiting an hour or longer before being forced to group with a couple of eleven year-old kids and a foul-mouthed sixty year-old, because if you like soloing even a little bit you can forget about this game. In addition the tech specs are way high-end and you will need to splurge out on a graphics card of at least around the $300 range or the game gets as choppy as a chinook in a crosswind. {EDIT}. Strictly for diehard Everquest 1 players with more money than sense."
5,"Everquest 2: Lots of content, lots of frequently added content and updated to make soloing viable","The EQ2 Development Team has added lots of new content, modified the game and interface to make it more user friendly. Added tons of solo content so that soloing is viable and fun. Addtionally they have added to adventure packs available for $5 each that add new areas and quests.WoW is fun but EQ2 is just as fun and a bit more challenging."
3,Everquest II,"I have seen Many Screenshots and Read previews about it and It sounds awesome except for one thing. You CAN'T transfer your Characters from The first EQ to this game, For this Reason, I think tons of people will not buy this game, Unless they have never started playing EQ before this Game Comes out. Personally I might not buy it for this reason."
1,Everquest - Bane of life,"Escape-ism at its finest. Your money would be better spent on a tread mill you will spend hous doing nothing.The customer service is non-existantThe Policing of the population is non-existantHow would you like to b3e playing one day and be propositioned for sex. Yes it happens. If you want to play a game to escape and have fun get some freinds and go play frisbee...you will live a longer happier life, I promise."
4,When is it really being shipped and with what???,"Does anyone know when this game is really being shipped this time? Amazon lists 9/15 but EBGames shows 11/15 as the projected ship date. Also, EBGames talks about a cd shipped to pre-order customers which is to be delivered the first week of August to allow early sign ups to create characters before the game goes online but I don't see any mention of this on Amazon. Does anyone know what the correct story is? When is the game actually scheduled to ship and do you get a key cd for pre-ordering?"
1,Not to fun,"The game has some very nice graphics to it in my opinion, but the game its self i found slow and boring. There is not much for the players who like to solo and the game in a way forces grouping taking away alot of fun. {EDIT}"
1,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this alarm clock for my 7 year old daughter to help teach her time and waking up to an alarm. I was very disappointed, it was very confusing which for me is a rare thing on an electronic. You would set the time but wasn't sure if you were setting the alarm. Once the alarm was set the stupid thing would not stop we somehow had set it to go off around 11:00 pm and the alarm was loud and would not stop even after supposedly turning it off. Now the clock which is stylish for a young girl sits useless on her dresser. Please do not buy this save your money and get something better."
2,Bratz Super-Star Style Alarm Clock,"This ""alarm"" clock is useless. The settings are extememly hard to understand. There is no light on the face of the clock, so you have to push a button on the back of the clock to see the time in the dark. The numbers on the clock are different sizes, making it very difficult for a six year old to see what time it is. I wish I had read the other review before I purchased it! This will definitely be a garage sale item in the near future!!"
5,Really awesome!!!,"I just bought this alarm clock.It is really nice on the outside.And the light-up is awesome.If you are patient and smart you'll understand how it works.It is RREEAALLYY easy to set-up if you know the instructions.Mine is working properly and I love it.I strongly recommend this itemBratz,you rock!!!!!!Your big fan."
5,MosDef,I have bought this book like three times...once for school and the other two is cuz I like it so much I want my close friends to read it too. It makes u look at life different.
3,problem with cord,"The size of the fridge and warmer was just right for the purpose. After one trip to Laredo, Texas, there was trouble with the cord attachment. Maybe if the cord was built in, it would be better but seems to break down when plugged in. I was able to return the first cooler and was very pleased with the return policy. Now have another cooler, not just another cord, and hopefully this one will do the trick."
1,Cheap Power Cord,"The power cord has failed within 3 months of purchase w/ only occasional use. There is apparently no warranty at Wagan's website. Just a ""tech support"" email input screen. I don't know that I would purchase this item now knowing the warranty support is virtually non-existent. I guess we'll see how that works out."
1,T45 - A real junker!,"I purchased the T45 fax machine about 2 years ago. 5 months after I purchased it, paper started jamming while sending a fax. Not only that, if I'd send a multi page fax, 2 or 3 pages would run through at the same time thus causing us to refax entire documents. Now every piece of paper that travels through the machine get's ripped up. I never write bad reviews, mostly because I never get lemons. This however takes the cake. The junker cake."
4,Love this raincoat!!!!!!!,"I absolutely love this raincoat! I was tired of getting wet, after using just an umbrella or wearing my rain slicker jacket.So-ooo I went to Amazon.com and found my Full Cut Raincoat. It goes down to my ankles, and when I wear my rainboots, I staycompletely dry. I bought it in yellow, so I could be easily seen. It has a hood, which was one of my prerequisites. It runs true to size, because I'm a medium in most things. Now I'm never depressed when the weatherman says its going to rain. In fact, I'm thrilled to have an opportunity to wear my new raincoat."
3,rubber raincoat,"I was looking for a slick, unlined raincoat for summer, good for keeping most moisture out. This raincoat is suitable, long enough and light weight enough for wet summer days. The only unexpected problem was it was a little too ""rubbery"" and smells like a tire, which hopefully will eventually wear off some. I ditched a steering wheel cover for just that reason, it made my hands smell."
1,where's my lens kit?,Placed this order through pcresource on 2/22 (paid for it already too)and it has not shown up yet.
1,"So expensive, and for what?",This piece of S started shreding it's black magic surface half-way into cleaning my cd. I should have just bought a new cd. This should be illegal. 30 bucks flushed. Jeez.
3,Game Doctor,"Game Doctor worked on almost all of my CD's. The bad part is that my G.D. Rotation Switch doesn't work! And when you try to buffer it, you can still see these lines on your CD. I really hate that. I wanted my CD's to run like new and look like new too."
4,Game/Skip/Data/Dvd dr.,"The game/skip/data/dvd dr is a great tool. They are all the same(so dont get ripped off by buying the higher price) They fixed my inoperabale cds, but could take a while to finish. be paitient it works!!"
5,Sri David Hamilton,Namaste ... Everyone should have and needs emotional freedom. This explains and teaches us how to achieve it. Thnx Love and light to you Dr. Judith Orloff
3,The Young Duke,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He hasen't had much time to read it yet, but what he has read he has really enjoyed."
2,"Not the ""Best of""","No ""I won't spread for no roses""; no ""Try it now""; no ""Cancer Boy"". Probably a full episode of Head Crusher alone. I couldn't wait to watch it and I, along with three other fans, was really disappointed (it's a fact!). Definitely not their best. MORE BRUCE, MORE BRUCE!"
2,Washing of Spears,"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought it was on Shaka and he is only a chapter or so. If you want a history of the Zulu nation, you would probably enjoy this book."
5,"Best Tabletop Wargame Available, Terrible Price","Games Workshop is literally world reknowned for their incredible quality in figures, gameplay, and most fun of all (for me) the assembly, painting, and accessorizing (building terrain, trees, etc.) that is an integral part of the hobby. This is the best you can get."
3,some grinding,"It blows, but not heavily. If you wind it a bit fast it may grind, like when you overwind a toy. I did find it useful and bring it camping with us."
1,Broke first day,I got it for my birth day which happend to be the same our heater broke. So my dad and I went to go gather fire wood. I used this piece of junk and the handle snapped clean off on one of the first cranks.
3,Great Tool for grilling but requires maintence prior to use.,"This a great tool for grilling, it really comes in handy to make your embers super hot and keeps you cooking longer. The only setback is that it is very sensitive. When I first used it, it started to jam on me towards the end of grilling. I took it home, took the whole thing apart piece by piece, (its a simple tool to take apart and reassemble), lubed it up and it continued to function like a dream. Great tool overall, but I wished it was made tougher. As long as your easy on the turning it should be fine. And to properly lube it up you need to take it apart."
2,A Worthless Unimaginative Read,"This over-rated book doesn't have much going for it except controversy created by some French Puritans in the 1950's who called it ""pornography"" and had it banned, thereby fueling its popularity. It's rather tame by today's standards, and very outdated and silly, not to mention dull. Most of the writing style is flat, drawn out prose, an imitation of Jack Keroauc and 1940's film noir crime novels, which the author translated. I find most of the scenes incredulous and there's a lot of ""sex"" going on, which doesn't seem very plausible in the novel. It deals with a black man who actually looks white who goes on to plot some type of revenge against ""whitey""."
2,Sadly lagging nbehind Macintosh OS developments,"A very handy product when we were on Mac OS 9. Sadly, Visioneer has not seen fit to keep the software up to date for OS X. It will still work in classic mode, but uncomfortably. The software for image editing shows its age. Visigo A4 Mac by Ambir is said to be able to take its place for OS X."
3,basic,"Very basic book to reference painters. I bought it for use while traveling in Rome and Florence but when it came to packing--this little book is far too heavy. Too heavy to bring out for a day of sightseeing in another country when there is so much else to carry.If you're into art history, it's good for a quick reference."
3,tire pressure cap,The caps let you know if you have at least 32 lbs. of air but you don't know if it over 32 unless you check wtih a tire gauge.
3,An entertaining addition to the series,"In the newest addition to the series, Annie O'Hara is back at home in New England. She is just about broke, still stuck with her sister-in-law's dog, and the only thing keeping her solvent is her two boarders. One of them is killed in the charity corn maze behind the tavern, and her brother is the main suspect. Annie and Claudius do not have much faith in the detective in charge, and it's up to them to solve the crime.I enjoyed the mystery and the story. The author has gotten more of a grip on the dog angle of the story. It won't outrage the dog lovers among us. I assumed that the mistakes made in the last book were due to the main character's inexperience with dogs, but am happy to see the errors mostly remedied. Claudius isn't left in hot cars or left to run loose in this story."
2,Disappointing.,"In a universe where probability math rules, Dom knows he's going to die on the day he becomes Chairman of the Board. However, he eventually manages to avoid numerous attempts on his life.Accompanied by Isaac, a Class Five robot, and Hrsh-Hgn, a phnobe, he goes on a quest to find the legendary Jokers' World, supposedly situated on the dark side of the sun.This early novel (1976, seven year before the first Discworld book) struck me as extremely messy. Indeed, I found the plethora of characters, races, robots and planets very confusing. Furthermore, since I'm not a Sci-Fi reader, the book failed to ring any bells and I guess I missed the puns and allusions. And even though Pratchett's famous style is already well recognisable, and premises of many later Discworldisms such as Hogswatchnight, Soul Cake Friday or Small Gods, are mentioned, they're not enough for me to recommend this book."
3,Impressive,"Can you find this old gem? I don't know. Before the utterly irresistible Discworld series, Pratchett wrote a little sci-fi. Like all else he writes, tongue in cheek. A bit of subtle parody, a bit of straight sci-fi, a bit of humor, a bit of wonder. The guy's an original, and I don't believe he's constitutionally capable of writing a bad book. I kill myself to master this craft, and Pratchett makes it appear so effortless. But I'm not jealous. No, not at all."
2,Not up to the Pratchett standard,"This work was firt published in 1976, and lacks the polish and sly wit that make Pratchett's later works so entertaining. After reading numerous Discworld books I was astonished at the effort required to wade through this early effort."
3,Primordeal Pratchett,"One of Pterry's earliest books, The Dark Side of the Sun is a forerunner of his Discworld series, and is unrealated.Not quite as good as the Discworld books, reading this book shows the evolution of his writing style as it progressed towards the best-selling greatness of today."
4,its ok,"it ok, its hard to use the bottom 1u space because of the angle, the gear must be very short to fit the bottom space before hitting your mounting surface....11u rack, not 12u...."
3,Works okay with my snowboards,"My board just barely fits. The bindings just fits, if I have my bindings just a little more appart I would not be able to fit my boards in.I did have to get the longer screws because my roof rack bars are thicker.The strap that holds the boards in place are also a bit of a pain to put on, especially when my hands are cold. But all in all the product works, and my boards have not falling off while driving."
3,"Nice to have, but not for everyone","The title must have done it: set my expectations so high that the book could only fail. The detailed descriptions of ""experiments"" are quite educational but after a while get very tedious and tiring. Besides, since people's tastes vary so much, how can anyone claim to have a PERFECT recipe of anything? I tried the perfect pancake recipe - made complicated by having to separate the egg - and my family couldn't tell the difference from a much simpler recipe I used previously. I thought the book was too thick, awkward to use while actually cooking, and lacked a very important element of cookbooks: photographs. Some recipes are too impractical. Andersen claims her bread recipe can be done everyday - sure, by somebody who doesn't work 8-hour days! Nevertheless, one will pick up some good tips, like how to fry chicken, etc."
4,Nice addition to a collection of Renaissance musice,"This CD contains much of the same material as ""Two Renaissance Dance Bands; Monteverdi's Contemporaries"" by David Munrow, but much quieter and simpler different style and instruments. I enjoy both."
2,leaky mess,There is nothing worse than a leaky bottle and these leak all the time. I think a better design is needed.
1,wish I didn't buy it,"This thing would have been 100% better if the top had a zipper to unzip it. As it is constructed, you have to take the entire box out to get to the back controls, manually scoop, or do any kind of cleaning. It made everything harder - I gave it away."
1,Not worth the trouble,This is a horrible invention. Once tent is assembled and you slide the litter box inside you do not have any access to the controls. Refilling the litter box is going to be a huge hassle. You would have to keep sliding the whole litter box out and that is a huge pain to do. The tent is not tall so if you have a big cat they may not want to go inside because of the lack of head room. Don't bother trying to unzip the tent it is not easy to re-zip without the fear of damaging it. Honestly this product is not worth the trouble. I would recommend the tent that goes on top of the box rather than this one.
2,Not so great,This item is cumbersome to put together for the first time and then each time you have to take the litter box out/in to clean or refill.It didn't help much with the smell and eventually my cat stopped using his litter box and relieved himself all over the house. I had to go buy a plastic pan and then he used that for a few days. This item is back in its box and the money spent on the item wasted.Eventually I got rid of the smell by changing to a wheat based litter. Doesn't clump the liquid waste as well (doesn't work that well with the automatic litter box) but the overpowering smells are gone. I don't have a problem scooping the stuff up at the end of the day and now my cat uses the plastic pan at night while in the garage and the automatic one during the day while in the house. I think that for some things simpler is better.For some people this item works but for me it was a disappointment. Maybe my kitty just was not happy with the closed-in feeling. Not sure...
3,Examples?,"As a physics and math major, I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the lack of examples in this text. Learning physics involves more than abstract mathematical knowledge, it involves examining the material in many real world situations.If you are considering assigning this text for your course, I beg you to reconsider. Your students will thank you!"
5,Superb writing,"The mark of good music writing is making you want to go listen (or re-listen) to the music - this book is full of those articles - obviously not all the genres of music were to my taste - but all the articles were interesting enough to make me pay more attention, and so learn more.Outstanding for me was ""Make a Joyful Noise"" by Geoffrey Himes - through this I found about Sacred Steel music played in churches - this alone was worth the price of admission.The beauty of this series is that one can discover or re-discover music and fall in love all over again."
2,This is not the best CD of the series,"Being a huge fan of Lost in Space, I was excited to see that there were 3 CD volumes containing original soundtracks from the show. I purchased all 3 and was very pleased with Volume 1 and Volume 3, but with the exception of the 3rd Season opening title, there was not much on this CD that was featured throughout the entire TV series. Most of the tracks were featured only in the episodes in which they are credited for, (Wild Aventure, The Haunted Lighthouse, and The Great Vegetable Rebellion)so therefore the music is not what I would call ""franchise"" themes. For those of you who are collectors of soundtracks, by all means add this to your collection, but if you are looking for familar tracks from the series, I would bypass this one and purchase Volumes 1 & 3 only."
2,Not Waterproof ....Buyer Beware,I bought this cover expecting it to be waterproof. The name does suggest that (Deluxe ALL Season). Hmmm maybe if the weather is sunny and no rain. Fits well but definitely NOT waterproof !!!
5,Great Cover,"I have been using this XL size cover on my Honda Shadow 1100 for about a month now, and it's great! The XL fits this style of bike well, and keeps most of the weather off of it. The heat resistant bottom has held up great so far, but I let my bike sit for at least 10-15 minutes before putting the cover on, just in case. The elastic bottom clings well to the bike and there are also some elastic straps and rubber grommets that allow you to secure it to the bike. So far it hasn't blown off or shown any signs of not being able to hold up to the weather.Overall:Great cover for a good price"
5,Great product,This is a great product. It fits over my Honda Shadow with windshield and saddlebags. Make sure you get xx large if you have these accessories. I ordered one day shipping and it was here the next day as promised. Great product for the money!
4,Very Good Cover but need to modify a bit,"I bought this cover for my 2012 Harley Ultra Limited. First off there are no holes for the antenna's on the TourPack so I needed my wife to create ""button"" holes on her sewing machine. Also the 4 big plastic grommet at the bottom of the cover beat the hell out of your paint when installing the cover on the bike. Had my wife sew ""Micro Fiber"" cloth over the grommets (on the inside of the cover) to insulate them from bike and keep them from scratching the paint. After all that, the cover goes over the antennas and fits the bike very well. It's light and rolls up pretty tight for packing it on the bike....wished I brought it yesterday when it rained here at work :( It's worth the money and a very nice cover. Would do it again"
5,Quality leather leash at a great price!,I received this leather leash for our new puppy and was quite pleased with the quality of it. It was very reasonably priced but is quite supple and the grain is very smooth. I felt it was a surprisingly good value compared to what I had seen in B&M pet stores.
1,Yuck,"Came soaking in oil-- was disgusting and didn't want to use it. Still am not using it. Doesn't feel like leather. Was cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Good product,"This adjustable, telescoping closet rod has a solid build and installation is easy. The ends have a tab that you can use to add extra support if you're mounting over a piece of wood. The tabs are easily bendable but one side comes pre-bent to be flush and when you bend it back it's easy to snap off. Personally I didn't need the tabs so I just snapped both tabs off. Not much to complain about, it simply works. Side note: I ordered two and on one of them the plastic packaging was torn - usually not a big problem but the screws are held in by this plastic packaging so I had to locate some extra screws around the house. Not a big deal though."
4,Robust USB drive - fast too!,"Purchased this drive to move my large file phots around from home to work, and family members etc. It is also has enough storage for small movies which will be useful.I wanted to be sure that the drive would stand the test of time since it would be moved around, dropped, squashed etc The rubber design is very tough and I can see it would be hard to break it. So top marks there.The write and read speed is very fast - make sure you check these time when comapring to other cheaper drives.I give 4 stars because the encryption software that comes with the drive is not user friendly, and this was a another key reason I bought it."
5,A MUST READ for any gardener,"I thank Dr. Male for writing such an informative book about the old fashioned heirloom tomato.I own and operate a greenhouse. I also sell hundreds of different varieties of tomato plants. My customers in this midwest farm country prefer heirloom tomatoes. Why? Because they just taste better.Now, thanks to Dr. Male, my customers and folks just like them, have the opportunity to see realistic photographs,read descriptions,and compare the different tomato varieties.All one need do, is taste the difference between the little red rock that one buys in a grocery store sold as a tomato, and compare it to the marvelous full flavor of a home grown heirloom tomato to be convinced that there really IS a difference.This is a beautiful, and useful book."
5,great great book,"this book is a simple question and answer book.it dosen't go into the assassination of JFK, but rather it answers the questions of who was this guy and what was his role.you learn about when ex-President Jimmy Carter was giving a speech on the JFK assassination and then the tv sound just went mute. the book answers what Jackie was actually reaching over the car for and who people like Lee Bowers were and what Richard Nixon and J Edgar Hoover had to do with the JFK assassination.this is a very simple book, but it's very informative and very well written.has numerous photos of some of the people mentioned in the book.great book."
1,Adds nothing to the debate,"There was just nothing new in this book that I hadn't already read before about the JFK assassination. Not for assassination buffs. I'm not sure who the audience for this book would be as it's not an overview for beginners or people only mildly interested, either.I was sucked in by the possibility of information about the Carter audio gap that occurred when he tried to mention the assassination, but it gave zero additional info about that, not even anything that would allow me to look up the event- no date, network, nothing."
5,"""A real ""Gem"" for all fans of this series""","John Williams composed the theme and complete scores for four of the first seven episodes. Williams ""Lost In Space"" theme was unlike anything he had previously written, a quirky melody propelled by brass, with wild flute lines and the notable addition of an electronic tonality similar to the wail of a theremin, the unusual sound that made Bernard Herrmann's - ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" score so unearthly.What can one say about the brilliant music Williams did on this series, I think this ranks right up there with ""Jaws"" - ""Star Wars"" and ""Superman"", and the list could go on. The cues and themes for ""Lost In Space"" sound as great today as they did some thirty years ago.GNP/Crescendo with Neil Norman and others have released a real ""Gem"" for all fans of this series and soundtrack lovers to enjoy forever. Highly, very highly recommend this to you and friends of - ""Will Robinson""!Total Time: 58:28 on 11 Tracks/ GNP/Crescendo Records - GNPD 8044 (1996)"
3,"Great series, bad Blu-Ray release","Shakugan no Shana is a great series and an all time favorite for many people. Great story, memorable characters, everything you need.The FUNimation re-release comes in a thick Blu-Ray case, with 4 DVDs containing episodes 1-24 (The OVA episode is NOT included!) and 3 Blu-Rays. The DVDs are alright, however the Blu-Ray version is not true HD this time, it is just a bad upscale. People who wish to own the Blu-Ray version, please note that it has almost every error that can occur during upscaling:-video noise-posterization-color banding-motion artifacts-the colors look bland and washedEven if you own an LCD TV then you should just play the DVD version, but even if you own a Blu-Ray player, it is better to go with the DVD discs, because the DVD has overall better quality then the Blu-Ray (if watched from normal distance).The series is 5 stars, but I only give 3 stars because of the bad Blu-Ray quality."
1,not the right item,"The bottles I received were unsealed and my chinchilla wouldn't eat the food material, it also looked different from the identical product we have purchased in the pet food store. It was a mixture of the actual product and some other less expensive chinchilla food which we do not purchase because the animal won't eat it. It picked out and only ate the expected components and filtered out and did not eat the added ingredients.They refunded my money without any questions right away."
1,I got it for free and I still wasted my money!,"Pure outerworldly waste! Nothing about this CD is worth hearing. From the completely untalentled poetry, to the unimaginative ""special effect"" sounds. If this were a horror movie I would describe it as less than B. If I could give it zero stars I would. The singing is FAR less than amateur. My dog is currently walking around whining at the painful vocals that are radiating from my speakers."
3,Out of date,Nice scanner but all the information on the scanner was out dated and need up dating which took sbout 4 - 6 hours
5,What a buy,Surprisingly good collection available for only $5 this past holiday season. Maybe Amazon figured it was worth more since reviewers like it so much. Others have mentioned it- but the Dave Brubeck arrangement of We Three Kings is one of his best.
3,The Heart's Desire,"The ratio of soap opera to gutmunching is out of whack in this, the weakest of the four volumes of ""Dead"" that I've read. The emphasis is more on sentimental goo than zombie gore as the survivors of the apocalypse explore their prison refuge and each other. The cheezy melodrama gets thick when alpha males Rick and Tyreese have their duke-it-out confrontation, and Rick's self-important, neverending climactic speech gets downright ridiculous. But it's inevitable that sooner or later, someone's gonna leave a door or a gate open and let in some hungry zombies. Here's hoping the next volume will be less jawin and more chawin."
1,garbage,"IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GREAT GEORGE ROMERO TYPE ZOMBIE STORY KEEP ON LOOKING.THIS CLOWN WHO WRITES THIS STUFF HAS THE CHARACTERS IN THE STORY JUMPING IN AND OUT OF BED WITH EACH OTHER MORE THEN FIGHTING ZOMBIES.I BOUGHT THE FIRST 4 ISSUES ALL TOGETHER THINKING IT WOULD BE GREAT.BOY WAS I WRONG.BORING STORY,LAME BATTLES WITH ZOMBIES,TO MUCH SEX.RENT DAWN OF THE DEAD INSTEAD OF BUYING THIS GARBAGE.not good at all."
5,The walking dead rules!,"I give five stars because these comics are so good u can't stop reading them, over and over!I have never in my life liked comics, but The Walking Dead is just that good!If you like the TV series you should read the comics, because they are even better!This issue left me hanging on the edge of my seat for more...."
2,Not Very Good!,This is NOT a Players Guide.If you want that buy Nintendo's Guide.It is a good storybook though.
3,"""metal shield"" had holes","the metal shield seems to be a black powder-coating on the whole unit. well, there were several spots on my unit where the ""shield"" was missing. it was a cheap item, so i forgive them and will keep it. but i thought that y'all should know."
5,Wondertful album!,"I have ""loved"" Neil Diamond since I can remember. I am from the era when he wrote songs for others...then himself. I have also been priviledged to see him in concert in NJ about 12 years ago and it was awesome.His music is timeless and his shows are happy, upbeat and involve the audience. He is a win, win all the way.If you love good music, this is some of his best! Enjoy =)"
4,It will take you away.,"Jerry Goldsmith's theme is awesome and Jay Chattaway (who I have been a fan of ever since I first heard his score for William Lustig's Maniac) contributes a nice, if fairly routine, sci-fi score. Both fans of the series and of the composers will want to have it. Recommended."
4,sounded like show,"yes, this did remind me of the program and many of the episodes, if u are a voyager fan, then this is the CD for u"
5,Excellent leashes and excellent service,I love the leashes and love the service and am reordering more leashes. Thank you for having such a wonderful product that is perfectly priced.Julie Stoddard
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought a Visioneer 6200 USB 11 months ago. This month it failed. I called the tech support number...and held for 1/2 hour before giving up. The next day I held for 1 1/2 hours before giving up. Today, after an hour hold time, I finally got through to a tech. Although I had the answers to her questions, she would not talk with me because I was not at home in front of the scanner (I don't have enough time to wait on hold for them while at home). I had already verified through e-mail correspondence the probable problem, however, they would not send parts or a new unit. Carefully consider how you may be left out in the cold when you purchase this item!"
1,"Complete waste of time, energy and money.",Length:: 0:39 MinsBeck Arnley 101-4585 Tie Rod EndAll Amazon has to offer is service and this Arnley outer tie rod end fell far short of what I expected. So let's see what your service is like.
1,NOPE,POOR VOCALS THAT ARE OCCASIONALLY IN-TUNE.GUITAR WORK THAT IS PAINFULLY DATED AND UNENLIGHTENED.Those are the NICEST things that I can say about this CD. It goes downhill from there. Maybe check out Clapton or SRV if you want to hear music that this CD tries to copy.
4,Great Christian Fiction in the C.S. Lewis mold,"Harry Blamires's series takes a critical look at the Christian Afterlife and attempts to brush away many of the fuzzy-headed assumptions about good and evil that we have let grow up over the years. This first novel in the series shows the main character visiting Purgatory and uses it as a chance to make fun of the intelligensia that would pretend such things as good and evil simply do not exist. Always written with a comic and cynical eye, the book is a fun read. Though not as clever or as deep as C.S. Lewis, Harry Blamires is easily my second favorite Christian fiction author out there, bar none."
5,Incredible read!,A must read for anyone who thinks they know what is best for the rest of us or for those who are fed up with that type of mentality!
5,"Cheap, works perfectly","I bought a used PS2 and the cable that came with it was pretty worn, resulting in frequent frustration and lots of getting up.I'm happy to report that this cheap substitute solved my problem :)Highly recommended for its great value."
2,It worked... a bit,"Extremely cheap AV cord here. It worked to replace our totally broken cord, but it got damaged quickly. One of the sides of the part you insert into the Playstation cracked and bent, making the device very loose in the console. The other side quickly followed, and soon after, the sides of the plastic insert just broke off. This caused the device to fall out when the console was moved even a little. It also resulted in only one speaker side working because the device no longer fit into the console and it messed up the sound. We ended up having to prop up the device by inserting a video game case under it."
5,Works for PS3,I wanted to have a audio RCA outlet for my analog headset and this works well for ps3. Now I have a analog gaming headset that connects audio through av cable and mic connects through usb jack through those mini usb sound cards.Didn't have to waste $75 for those specialized PS3 gaming headsets.Only spent $7 dollars for usb sound card and av cable combined.And connect with my pc headset.Good deal.
4,"Powerfully Cheap, But Left Feeling a Little Short","The product is as it is described, and I fully endorse its purchase.That being said, It should be noted that this is obviously not the regulation cord. If you are replacing an original cord, then you are going to lose a good two feet of length. This cord also lacks the mechanism at the PS2 end of the cable that protects it from kinks and pulls.If your PS2 is already close to your TV, or you have the ability to arrange things the way you need to, then this is the wisest purchase for a replacement AV cord. If not, you have been warned."
1,Cheap after-market product,"We've had this product for less than a month and it already broke off in our TV, so now we're going to have to try and get that repaired! We definitely got less than we paid for--and we didn't pay that much."
1,Ps2 cord,I never received the item but found my old one and since it was only a couple dollars I did not complain. Probably won't use amazon again in the future unfortunately.
1,Atricious collection of articles,"This book's title looks attractive at first sight, but once u begin to go over the chaptersone over another, u will realize that the informations given just suits a less than novicetrader who came from another planet with zero background. I wasn't impressed at all in theway the fundamentals were interpreted and explained(when the fundamentals encompass a bigchunk of forex market today), and the technicals superficially covered while the psychologyeffects of the fx market are not even mentioned. so the reader is left with a less thanforex 101 materials with zero infos on fundamentals and psychology. As for the moneymanagement section, it gives just a compilation of some articles posted online with noreal(and pragmatic) systematic plan how to apply it(""it"" goes for money mgt.). All in All,better google the word ""forex"" for u will find more suitable and valuable data on the fxmarket.good trading for all"
1,Pure scam artist,"Guys, do yourself a favor, just research on the net on him and his stupid GlobalTec and 4XMadeEasy firm.. It's crap. I'm a professional currency trader and everything from his firm to this book to his stupid JAME S DICK magazine is so superficial that even a junior high kid can write them. I can just work with a 15 year old to write something like that for one month and produce something similar. It's so sickening stupid that I feel sick and disgusted.. even the guy looks like a dick. If there is no star rating.. that is my rating for him.. 1 star is an overstatement already."
3,"OK, but do not use this book for tax advice!!","Most of the Forex information is ok, some of it is quite good. However, there are many misstatements of fact in Chapter 15 - The Business of Trading. The sections entitled ""The Tax Code"" and ""What Kind of Corporation Should You Use"" contain numerous errors. Anyone trading would be wise by investing in Robert A. Green's ""The Tax Guide For Traders""."
4,Iearning what trading is about,I am new to the world of trading and thinking about trying it. This book was well written.At first I had some trouble understanding it but a second reading seemed to make much more sense. I now consider it to be my basic reference. I honestly think the value of the book really excedes to price I paid for it. I can't speak for those with a lot of experience but for a beginner I think it is a must have. It allows me to understand and suppliment information available from trading sites.Mr Dicks included enough personal information so I felt like he was my friend teaching me the basics.
3,"Don't be ""Out Cold""","If you are a Zach fan, then you will love this DVD. If you are not and are simply looking for a stand up comedy DVD, then move along. Zach is brilliant in that kind of way, that most people are turned off by it. If you watched the movie Out Cold, and wanted more from him, this will probably not be the place to start. Check out Comedians of Comedy that features Zach and he has the ability to play off of others really well. Here, it is almost an artist with too much tools to play with and not enough direction. Featuring lots of ""characters"", including an interview with his ""twin"" brother Seth Galifinakis."
2,Not impressed,"I saw Zach's special on Comedy Central Presents a while back and thought he was genius. I bought this DVD with high expectations, but they were definitely not met. It seemed to me like he barely told any jokes. He just spent 15 minutes making fun of someone in the audience. The interview with ""Seth"" is by far the best part."
2,Ladyhawke does not fly!!!,"I have a lot of respect for Alan Parsons musically,I know however when someone is simply collecting a paycheck when I hear it. I love the film ""Ladyhawke"" But Parson's soundtrack spoils the film from the beginnig...It opens with a rock song (ala eye of the tiger) that is typical canned rock that makes me glad it isn't the 80's anymore...Never mind the movie is set in a midevil period...The more traditional orchestral filler is adequate but doesn't evoke any emotion the way the score for ""Romeo and Juliet"" does for example. This is a very good and original film that deserved but did not recieve a worthy soundtrack."
3,Not easy reading for kids,"More suited to parents who read to kids. Difficult for kids to read by themselves ...A lot of reviews here imply they are for 5-7yrs. I would place it more at 9 yrs but it depends on the kid. Best to make your own mind up.""She was startled by a sudden cadence of distant hoofbeats. She caught her breath and opened her eyes, staring into the murky dusk."" (book 1)""Fiona loaned her a loose-sleeved raspberry blouse and an embroidered pinafore of columbine blue. Talia's aunt gave her a copper-colored scarf with a lacey edge."" (book 3)"
4,A cute Series for kids who are ready for beginning chapter books,"This is the first chapter book series my oldest daughter read. We started team reading the first book, but by the end of the series she was reading most of the book on her own. She didn't have problems with the vocabulary. The reading level is equivalent to the ""Magic Tree House"" series."
2,Ostentatious,"As one should expect from a name like ""Cuff Daddy"", these are huge. Completely useless for anything but costumes.They do look like the picture, but they are so big that the effect is far different. They arrived in a nice box, and without damage."
2,This book is missing a key component,"The title of this book is ""Type in Motion,"" but it's missing just that - type in motion. In order for this book to be really useful, it should have a DVD or CD with image files that can be reviewed. Instead there is nothing but screen grabs, which is interesting but not especially helpful.I wouldn't bother."
2,An in-depth exploration of language and the mind.,"In this book, Frawley links Vygotsky's sociocultural theory of the mind with the computational mind in cognitive science. He presents an in-depth exploration of the development of linguistics and how it relates to the nature of the mind. He explains that we not only have a language of thought, but also a language for thought. This book is designed to challenge our beliefs on thinking, not to give easy answers."
3,Does the job,"I must admit that I was disappointed. This mailbox does the job, but is not all that I expected. It is made of ""space-age polymers"" (plastic). It's very lightweight and has a cheap feel to it's consistency. The price paid for this hunk of plastic seems a bit high. I actually cut my arm on one of the plastic edges while installing this box.However, it does the job effectively so it's not a total loss. As someone else pointed out, the lock is of good quality, unlike some other units out there. Size is definitely a big factor. My wife and I are on the road a lot, so it's helpful to know that we don't have to trust the USPS to forward our mail, as this box is big enough to hold a month's worth of mail if necessary.BOTTOM LINE: If I had found this box in a store and had a chance to handle it before purchase, I probably wouldn't have bought it. That being said, it's a much better option than I had before. It'll do, but it's not the ""cat's meow""."
2,poor manufacture,"THE DOOR ON THE MAIL BOX DOES NOT CLOSE WITHOUT PUSHING IT CLOSED AND I HAD TO PUT A HANDLE ON IT TO PULL IT OPENIT REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF FORCE TO CLOSE IT AND OPEN DUE TO IMPROPER FIT UP OF THE DOOR INTO THE MAILBOX ITSELFTHE CONCEPT OF IT IS GOOD, THE CONSTRUCTION OF IT IS POOR"
1,garbage,"This is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever purchased, the door will not stay shut, I had to drill holes into door and box and installed magnets, found the locking door pried open and mail gone, so had to install a steel hinge to prevent the door from being pried open at the bottom this is not a good buy find yourself a better one."
3,Mailguard,"Not quite what I expected, Mail slot is kind of small for a rural delivery mail box,cannot accept small boxes or larger envelopes, cheaply made plastic hinges which could be forced open very easily but rubbermaid boxes are very similar. Shipping time and packaging was fine."
1,Horrable picture and sound,"I bought the rfu adapter so i could hook up my ps2 in my room. I got it all hooked up and poped in a dvd i had rented and when it came on i was shocked. It looked like it was night time and it was acutaly light out. Also the sound is mono, so it only comes out one speaker. After this i bought a new tv(i needed one anyways) and the s video cable. The s video cable is awsome. Anyways, i highly recomend that you try to find an alternative to the rfu adapter if you want to watch movies. The game picture isn't to bad, but is not even close to s video or even the adapter the ps2 came with."
2,Okay.,Not a great product. Sometimes I have to play with it for it not to be fuzzy. Could be the coax cable though but I doubt it.
1,"It Does the Job, But...","Only use an RFU connection if it is absolutely necessary. By using RFU, the visual quality of your PS2 games, DVD, etc. will be severely degraded to a lower resloution. Through an RFU connection everything is blurry, dark, and the colors bleed (not to mention the mono sound...It'll do the job if it's really necessary, but just be aware that you're not seeing the visaul quality that the PS2 was made for."
5,Wonderful help for anyone tired of personal ego stories.,Very short and easy to read. Quotes and pictures from a great spititual teacher. I was led to find sny of his writings when I heard Adyashanti say that he was his favorite teacher.
2,Lettering on Keys Wears Off Almost Immediately,"I purchased this keyboard because I wanted the L-shaped extra large Enter key and since the keyboard comes with a lifetime warranty, I figured the lettering wouldn't wear off right away. I was extremely disappointed to discover that was not the case."
5,Panda,We purchased this panda to help add a child's touch to a new panda room that we decided on for our first born baby. It looks as described. It is very soft and is huge! The company sent the merchandise very quickly and it was all around a very good experience.
2,Not great,"This pillow was thinner than pictured, and not comfortable. I wouldn't recommend this one. It needs to be a bit thicker and firmer."
1,Hard as a BRICK,"My teenage son wanted one of these but after sleeping on it was really disappointed. It was hard and uncomfortable. It ended up getting shoved between the bed and the wall and several months later he found it and said it had softened up considerably. (Still not great, though.) Not sure whether to attribute the change to time or the fact that it was near the baseboard heat and the warmth softened it. Either way, who wants to buy a pillow and wait months for it to get comfortable? We'll try another brand."
1,Garbage,This pillow is garbage! It lost its shape after only a couple of weeks. It also smelled really bad for a week when it came out of the box.
4,Could be perfect but...,"The wire top does not attach to the plastic tray! It doesn't, it just sits on it. So use bungee cords or something to ensure your overly energetic (and ultra bored) kitty doesn't topple it and escape.There is plenty of room for a large, covered litter box inside of it, btw. We got it to keep our 3 feline companions during our move, and it served its purpose. But beware of the movable top. It is really a huge design fault. Other than that, the cage is good and very useful."
5,A Treasure of a Memoir,"In this beautifully rendered book, from the quaint map inside the cover, to the photographs sprinkled throughout, one finds a place to linger and learn, and ultimately feel what it must have been like to carve out a life in the relative wilderness of Northern Wisconsin during the Great Depression.It is amazing to contemplate that we need go back only a few generations into this family of story tellers to retrieve the tale of a life so free of our current technology and luxuries. Their combined perspectives of artist and engineer give the telling heart and precision, and make me yearn to build my own cabin amid the pines, overlooking Lake Lipsie."
2,far too long to wait,This book took far too long to get to Canada. Why that should be I do not know.I had left the country before it came and had to organise a colleague to pick it up from old address and had the expense of sending to to Australia after that.So the book that cost me 1c cost about $18 to get it to Canada late and $36 to get it to AustraliaAlso it transpires it is an old Library book with withdrawn all over first page.I AM glad to have a copy of this book but could have bough a good copy in Canada for the price of the double postage so therefore am not really impressed with this whole deal.They could have told me about the wait at the outset which would have allowed me to have it send DIRECTLY to Australia
3,They should have put the tribbles music on a separate track,"With the exception of the tribbles music, I like this CD. The reason I wish the tribble music was on a different track is so I could skip over it automatically. The tribbles music interrupts my listening pleasure after the Star Trek theme song. One other thing I don't like about this CD is the demo software. Every time I try to listen to it on my computer, it starts to load up the software and I have to stop it every time."
2,"good band, lousy album","These guys are great live. And their earlier album reflects that to some degree. But this album is a mess. The songs are shapeless and devoid of any musical ideas. It seems all their effort went into writing the lyrics, which ride over the generic bilgewater chords in a torrent of verbiage. They should just have published a couple of essays instead."
2,"If you want to spare yourself some grief, then this is the only review that matters.","This has some tracks ranging from pretty good to the absolute worst music I've heard in forever. I'd say the singer kills it most of the time by tryin to rap, and he doesn't even manage to pull that off very well.. and when he sings, can we say Thousand Foot Krutch ripoff. Please believe me when I say that Sixteen Today and Sickness are the only decent songs on here. The rest is absolute trash and filler..and as for Party Political, the single, he sings it sooooo rediculously it makes you wana puke. Download Sixteen Today and Sickness, buy the TFK cd's and forget this."
5,KICK ASS SINGER!!,"A lot of the reviews are slamming this band because they tend to rap on few of these songs. One review even mentioned Limp Bizkit, but how in the hell can you compare this guy's singing with Fred Durst. This guy can sing his ass of when he wants to. The songs absolutley rock. One request for the next CD though... Less rap and more singing!! Although the rapping on the CD is good, songs like The Sickness and track #7 totally KILL!! Get this CD....."
4,Jules Mom,"We were looking and looking for a storage solution that wouldnt make our living room look more like a play room. It's very sturdy and is the perfect height for our 2 year old. Daddy put it together while our daughter napped, very simple and is a beautiful piece. We found this modeled in Toy R Us, so we knew what the finished results were. No problems with any defects or missing hardware."
3,Not what I expected...,"The DVD is ok. Good background music. I was under the impression these images would be ""still"" images on a slide show, but it is video of the images. I thought it repeated alot of the same shots. Plus, there are tons of people in the video. At some points, all you see are people crowding through doorways, completely unrelated to Christmas images. I'll still use it as a background for holiday parties, since people aren't going to really be ""watching"" the TV."
4,Red Hand of Doom,"I haven't yet had a chance to run the adventure, though I look forward to doing so. I love the usage of Victory Points, and the rules are clear enough as put forward in the adventure to not require Heroes of Battle. I found the plot comprehensive and believable, the presentationw as excellent. All in all, I very much like the adventure, and I can't wait to run some PCs through it."
5,Best D+D adventure,"Having started D+D'ing way back in 1980,I've played a large proportion of the output of Tsr and my current group(together 15+ years)have embraced the 3.5 system,so we're up to date with current stuff.I've just bought R.H.O.D.and I can honestly say that this is probably the best module I've seen in 25+ years.Not having DM'ed 3.5 yet,I can't wait to adapt this to our campaign and give the players a real challenge.'Ditto previous comments re. use of non-combat skills,stunning artwork,etc.If your group hasn't got this adventure yet and you're ok with pre-written stuff then it is a must-buy.Well done W.O.T.C.!"
2,Nonessential & Unexceptional,"I love the Holy Modal Rounders....they may be the best in ""acid folk"", original and playful (all other music can seem pretentious in comparison), but this recording isn't that great, (and surely not in the league of Zappa's WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY, a Great! 5 star and important composition - satiric, amazingly well produced masterpiece), this is merely a piece of the era, not well produced or very flattering for the Rounders crew.... It is fun and unpretentious (Take-off Artist and The STP songs are okay), but you'd do better sticking with HMR 1&2, HAVE MOICY!, TOO MUCH FUN, or I MAKE A WISH FOR A POTATO - or, for a more in-depth and revealing documentary, the 2007 DVD BOUND TO LOSE."
1,Not as pictured - and streaky,"Similar to some other reviews posted, we received this item in June and it was not in the depicted retail package, purchased from Ink Express but fulfilled by Amazon. We tried the cartridges and had streaky printing issues with both - managed with repeated cleaning to get the first to work to the end but the second could not be fixed. Due to time constraints we purchased a new Canon cartridge at a local retailer, and it works fine.We suspected that the non-standard packaging and the problems we had with these cartridges were more than coincidence, and Amazon did in fact offer us a refund on the item. If you had similar issues - contact Amazon. 1 star for the item, 5 stars for Amazon customer service!"
3,ink,it worked what more can i say but this review wont let me quit without these words being used now
5,Works as expected,It's hard to rave about printer cartridges but these definitely made my printouts as black as black can be. The work exactly as expected so that's nice.
3,Ink cartridges should last longer,"This variety pack saves you a little money, so it is worth it. These ink cartridges are easy to install and work well, but they don't last very long. It is a racket the way the sell you good printers for cheap and then bleed you dry paying for ink. I would look for printers in Consumer Reports that say they are a good value for not using up ink too fast. The non-factory refills for this unit pretty much suck. Ink leaks or smears and they are not much of a savings to begin with. We hardly ever print color. It just uses up too much ink, much too fast. Color printing with these cartridges is not worth the money."
3,This is a great controler if you keep it working,"My friend and I love these controllers the only problem is the wont stay working, they work great for a month or two then stop working correctly they will work for somegames but then not on others. This is an excellent controller for Tiger Woods 2003 and 2004 golf but it tears up on you fast. I think interact needs to do some more work on these. INter Act is hard to get contact info on also web site does not work."
1,StormChaser GamePad,The reason these cost less is because it is not as good quality as the Sony brand.Sometimes Sony will recommend you to not buy this because it might mess up your PS2.Spend the extra bucks and get the best.
4,A quality product.,"I purchased this controller because I had a multi-tap and only two dual-shock controllers. The store I was in only had these left on the shelf, I figured I'd buy it, then return it, and pick up more dual-shocks when I could. After using it for a day it was quite obvious that this controller was much better suited for those of us with large hands. The extra space was much appreciated, and the extra programmable buttons on the front are real nice. The rumble is much improved, almost too much, on some games it must be turned down as not to interfere with game play. At ..., ... cheaper than Sony's, I would reccomend this controller to anyone who finds the dual-shock nice but a bit small. I did go out and pick up two more dual-shocks, but for UT and SSX I don't use anything but my StormChaser. Oh yeah, I agree that StormChaser is a really lame name. PS (don't even bother trying to buy wireless controllers yet, they are all garbage.)"
5,Great Controller all around,"Big hands? Get this controller. Nice rubber grips on the handles make for error free gaming during the most intense moments, whether you are fighting for first place in a Corvette or fighting it out to the finish in WWF SmackDown. The thing I like most about this controller is its right stick compatibility with the left stick. See, I like to game AND eat at the same time. So, I'm eating with my left hand, and my right hand can control the right analog stick, which does the same thing as the D-Pad or the left analog stick. You may be confused now, but wow, its easy to use and it does save time, believe me. It is big and it does take time to get used to, but its a really good controller all around. I'd buy it if I were you."
1,Horrible!,"Tony's heard the words from other people who've seen the truth and tries to regurgitate them for you here. Unfortunitly regurgitated words that have been misunderstood are lifeless and lack any 'power' to wake you up.On this very subject there are countless books that are full of life and do have to power to wake you up.Please, please, please don't buy this book. It will only further cause you to suffer and confuse you.Nisargadatta, Ramana Maharshi, Gangaji, Eckhart Tolle and Adyashanti all speak about the truth in a much clearer way and thier words indeed have the mysterious ability to wake you up."
1,Disjointed Heavy Academic Ramblings,A disappointing package of disjointed material and a lot of recycling of standard leadership theory. The old theories are repackaged in heavy academic jargon to make it seem that something new is being offered. I am sorry to report that I gained very little from the enormous effort that was involved in reading this book. It was disappointed that so many well-known academics and experts in the field allowed the publication of such disjointed ramblings under one cover. If you are having difficulty getting to sleep at night this book is for you.
2,Quite empty,"Nothing much to say about this book, in fact there is very little inside. It is more like an introduction. I never pratice jujistsu but I trained for karate (with some self-defense) for years, and I don't think this book bring me much, except for the ground-fighting chapter (but you will find a lot more ground techniques in ""Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Practice"" by Renzo Gracie, Royler Gracie). I did not like at all the weapon defense part, which shows you how ""easy"" it is to get rid of someone with a knife or gun ! Please, don't show that in an introduction book, people are gonna get killed trying it !"
1,Product review should make it more clear that this is NOT a burner,I was also confused and thought that this was a CDR and ordered it -- the write up isn't clear enough about that.
5,"Finally, somebody ""put it all together""!","I have both studied and taught the major topics of Indian classical thought and have traversed India and East Asia in search for knowledge of the ancients. Yet I have found, as have countless others, that what appears to be forever elusive is a way of organizing the principles and practices of yoga, karma, astrology, medicine, and all the other Vedic arts into one comprehensive and meaningful whole. In Jeffrey Armstrong's book, God the Astrologer, it all comes together. All the apparently disparate branches of knowledge are connected to each other with an elegance and clarity I have never before seen. Armstrong has provided the complete -and practical! - map of the territory so many of us were looking for. I highly recommend this book, not only to scholars of religious thought and philosophy, but to all who search for deeper meaning in their lives. [Steffan Omray]"
2,Use this at the Library,"Although this is a good career guide for peopel interested in pursuing a career in public relations, I wouldn't hang on to it at home. It would serve you--and your pocketbook--better if you checked it out from your loca library and took notes from those careers highlighted that interest you the most."
5,Amazing!,"Last week I hear Marina Raye for the first time. There are truly no words to describe the complete and total peace that came over me. I have been practicing meditation and continuously find myself making lists in my head. When I used ""Being Peace,"" this stopped! The music is soothing and calming; it takes me to another place.This is a must purchase for you and all of your friends."
4,Really Nice Toybox,I purchased this toybox for my 18 month old and it is perfect. It is built really strong and I especially love that the hinges hold the lid in place from falling on little fingers! I'd definately recommend this toybox to anyone.
3,"A trip, with plenty of downers","When jamming bands walked the line between over-the-top chaos in a studio-recorded environment. A tough balance, achieved here in this one-album group. Shades of early Love influence but with two drummers, cool keyboard and an equally theatric singer. Refreshingly short songs (unlike Quick Silver Messenger Service). Able to say what they want usually in under 3 minutes. Only 2 duds (Street Singer and Mr. Blue) on the whole thing, and even they are interesting. Production quality is good, not great, but probably as good as it was going to get. Check out their cameo in the 1967 James Coburn movie, The President's Analyst."
2,Clearlight at last but does it really matter?,"Though no fault of the musicians, this album should have remained in the vaults and never seen the light of day.They play all the right notes but Paul Rothchilds questionable production values never allows the music to emerge. Instead, Rothchild cheapens Clearlights material to the point of being nothing more than an over-produced meal for his ego.(the tension he created is documented in the liner notes).Admittedly, it is a nice clean stereo mix but lacks that special something from this era that made music so memorable. It just is not something you will ever be humming along to...."
1,"wow..horrible, AND badly coded","OK, I admit, I love bad movies. And this may have proven to be my new favorite..it's just..awful. From it's complete lack of cinematic or editing continuity to it's bad industrial film style acting, the quality of this film is about fifth-grade home video level (sorry kiddies). But then I made the mistake of pausing it, and the DVD was so badly coded that it returns to the beginning and there are NO CHAPTERS in the entire thing, so you have to start over from the beginning. But then, when you try to fast-forward, it freezes up and returns to the beginning..AGAIN. Like I said, I love rotten movies, but even I'm not masochistic enough to watch this all the way to where I stopped in in order to find out the ending. I'll re-watch Devil Dog, hound of hell. Now THERE's a great/bad dog movie!!"
1,Very Advanced,Great book but unless you are a computational biologist with very advanced mathematical skills-don't bother. This was over my head as a basic epidemiology student. I was searching for a book to elucidate R-zero...this was not it.
5,Go Go Girl was a Hit!!,I totally loved the costume. The material was excellent and it fit very well. It was worth every cent!!! What made it even better was that everyone loved it as well.
1,Marketing Bias for rating.,It is disappointing to see Zircon Corporation Marketing director put in 5 stars to bias the rating. It would be good to see user ratings and not biased rating by Company marketing staff.Are they so insecure ?
1,Deep scan failed,Length:: 1:22 MinsThis garbage does not work at all.It failed to calibrate and failed to detect any deep studs that are behind siding wall from outside the house.Barely finding anything from inside.
4,replacement toy,"I came home one day and when I opened the front door I say my Maltese loping across the room with my fiance's doll in his mouth. Apparently he decided that if it is small and fuzzy it belonged to him.I purchased this as a replacement doll for my fiance since my dog decided he would ""borrow"" the other one."
4,Excellent First Book,"I enjoyed reading Ms. Malone's first novel. I picked the book up at a Book Fair in Memphis, TN. I took a chance on buying the book, but after reading it I am glad that I did. I was able to finish the book quickly. Good luck on the next novel!"
5,Cosmic Voyage an Educational Breakthrough,"In this incredible journey the viewer travels from the outer reaches of space down into the nucleus of a carbon atom. Cosmic Voyage is able to explain, in layman's terms, the theory of how the universe began - the ""Big Bang"" and how the entire mass of the universe could have been compressed into a space the size of a tennis ball. Parallel worlds? Life on other planets? Cosmic Voyage answers all these questions. Teachers will rate this film five stars and a must have for the classroom."
5,"Great quality, well-made, very attactive.","This switch-plate is very attractive, heavy and well-made. We will purchase the matching accessories for our master bath update, at this site!"
1,When?,"When will America stand up to retailers and scream ""NO MORE CHINCY CHINESE JUNK- WE""RE SICK OF INFERIOR PRODUCTS AND WE""RE NOT BUYING IT""!!!Unfortunately there is very few products made in the USA anymore- but as long as people keep buying this junk from china, manufacturers will not listen.Insist on made in USA or don't buy- the next job to be ""out sourced"" may be yours!"
1,Swing-A-Way Has Sold Out (to China),"Wanted to buy a Swing-A -Way for someone who complained about poor quality can openers. Swing-A-Ways have always been high quality and well-made openers. No longer, apparently. The latest versions are made in China and are mere shadows of their American-made predecessors (much less substantial; flimsy even). My recommendation: look for new old stock at your local mom and pop hardware store and you might get lucky (i.e., find a robust USA-made holdover).Why can't American marketers get it that many of us don't want Chinese junk?!?"
5,The Best Can Opener,"Thank you for the most durable, inexpensive, and practical can opener that we have ever owned.We are very satisfied with our experience."
5,it's classic.,Just your basic old fashioned can opener. It works! It's reliable. That's about it!And I need six more words.
3,Shame on Amazon!,"I just ordered and received two 407WH can openers for my Boy Scout troop. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when the ones I received were NOT made in the USA but made in China. One of the photos Amazon uses on the product page actually highlights the ""Made in USA"" logo. I can't speak to their quality yet but our Scouts manage to destroy every opener except the original Swing-A-Ways. They lose those. Will update this posting after the boys use the Made in China models for a while."
3,"Used to be the best...now, a little to be desired","I grew up with a real Swing-A-Way mounted to the door frame in our kitchen. It worked like a charm. As an adult I've tried many can openers that are far more stylish (and expensive,) but they always failed eventually. Usually it's the gears. So I went back to the tried and true, but this time the handheld version. It works every time without hassle. I recently purchased another just for opening canned dog food. I soon noticed it was rusting. My old one never rusted. Upon further inspection I see a ""Made In USA"" on the old one and nothing on the new one. It appears that the new ones are made elsewhere and from inferior materials. Too bad. If you are unsure where it's made, just open the device all the way and you can find the stamp if it's from the USA. Check my photos to see what I mean."
2,I'm very much in the minority - an alternative view.,"I'd been seeing this book mentioned and advertised for quite a while, and I decided to ask the wife for it for Xmas last year. I was delighted to receive it...until I opened it and started to read. Within a day, I was quite disappointed.The author has chosen a rather novel style for writing about each film, and it varies A LOT. It's almost a kind of random thoughts approach, proof-read into a somewhat cohesive review. But there's really no rhyme or reason to the reviews as to structure. It's a VERY dry read because of this. Some start with notes about the cast, others with plot elements, still others about the director or producer.Also, for such an expansive and expensive book about an entertainment medium which relies so heavily on images to convey it's message, this book contains an amazingly small number of pictures.All in all, if you are looking for a serious, insightful book about 50's sci-fi which reads like a textbook, this is it."
4,"All I can say is WOW, my head hurts. Tons of information",This DVD from Mark Sternal didn't disappoint me once again he covers aspects of scale usage and how modes function in each. If you want clear cut answers and learn something that you will use the rest of your life this is it. He covers a lot of ground to include the exotic scales that you don't hear about or see on youtube. Many of these other scales can be used in many musicial applications. I am so glad I bought this DVD.
3,Fairy Good Floor Mats,The product received is good for the value and was true to itscatalog photos. Was matching this to seat covers bought elsewhereand they coordinated perfectly thanks to Amy Brown/Amazon web info.Only draw back is that they do not fit perfectly in the car's floorarea (this is a 2000 Hyundai Accent).It would have been nice if any car model specifications were neededin order to purchase the right fit.
1,Amy Brown Floor Mats,"I purchased these as a gift. The description was vague and when it arrived, I was dissatisfied with the product. There are only the 2 front mats and at that price, all 4 should be included. They were thin and made real cheap. The fairy was like a rub on and looked cheap and I wasn't sure how it would hold up from dirty shoes.T hen there was embroidery around it, that wasn't even the sane color scheme as the fairy in blue's and black's, but in purple and white. I decided that they weren't worth the money and sent them right back."
5,Excellent!!,"Prog is the best work by the Bad Plus so far. The only song I could have done without is ""Everybody wants to Rule the World,"" but, you know they didn't ask me. Anyway, immediately following this opening number is my favorite song: ""Physical Cities."" This song is amazing, it starts with an amazingly beautiful, melodic yet rhythmic piano part and ends with industrial beats (that go on and on). This song was amazing when I first heard it and even more amazing when I saw them do it live. ""Tom Sawyer"" is also better than Rush ever could have dreamed it to be. Plus, ""Giant"" and ""Mint"" are also excellent, melodic originals. 1980 World Champion by drummer King again shows the humorous side of the band. These guys are amazing musicians with a sense of humor/fun that you just don't find much. Not to mention, I have to admit that Burt Bacharach (""This Guy's in Love with You"") has always been one of my guilty pleasures."
5,Aweome product,"These are by far the best condoms I've used. It's almost like the guy is wearing nothing at all. I'm also a little sensitive to other condoms. It must be the lube I'm sensitive to, but I have had no problems with these."
2,Great for kids,My son enjoys these very much. One thing I have notices is some flakey behavior. One game used to start and does not respond to the enter key anymore.. I don't know if it's because it was intended for Win98 and this is an XP machine.
2,"Thursday-Night Poker: How to Understand, Enjoy-And Win","I don't advocate this book. The author has virtually no knowledge of advanced play and in my opinion advocates a weak-tight style of play. This may suffice in a weak home game. However, tough players will destroy players that play in a manner that the text advises."
5,car trailer,Just the right size for most of my collection and a well built simple model to put together. Gives me room on the shelf for more.
1,doesn't work when its cold!,I bought this amp a week and a half ago and it doesn't work when it's below zero!! which is pretty often since i live in northern Minnesota. I have an older jensen amp and never had any problems like this with that one. Other than that im happy with the way it sounds when it works!
3,A Good Book,"The problem is, one can only have so many interests before one is spread too thin, and my long affair with Russian writing was fraying when I bought this and found it a little dry and unable to rekindle the passion.Follow me? If you love Russian lit, this is a good buy. If it's not your primary or secondary interest, it's overkill.Obviously a labor of love by the author. The Russians may have produced the best body of literature per writer than anyone, and fans will find this leads them to undiscovered treasures."
3,Good,I have not had such good luck with these batteries. They seem to wear out way to fast. I have had several of them and all seems to be the same.
4,A Very Necessary Battery,"We have two Eureka pickups that use this battery. The reason we have two is that the battery died on the first one and it was cheaper to buy the complete vacuum rather than the battery alone. We wish the company would create a better battery that didn't suffer from ""memory"" and would last longer. But in the absence of that, we are grateful we found this battery at a cheaper price. The model number of the battery doesn't agree with the model number in the vacuum, but I called Eureka and they confirmed it was the right one."
1,replacement battery,I purchased this battery to replace my old one. It worked until I had to recharge it on the charger I received with my vacuum. It would not recharge therefore my vacuum will not work. I am not happy at all with my purchase.
5,Exactly what needed,"Fast, quick, easy, and works perfectly! What more can I say. I am always concerned about buying online, but transactions like this make me much more comfortable."
1,Battery Defective,Battery would not hold a charge from day one has been thrown away. The one that came with the vac was good must be verypoor quality control.
3,Dr. Oct loses his voice on a collab album,Kool Keith as Dr. Octagon is a dope mc but when he's thrown in with numerous fake thugs and ordinary east coast west coast mc's KK loses his voice and is left with little time to make the album a creative force like the first album. The production is one of those group things but is overall good. Understand this is not a KK solo album but rather a decent part indie part industry collab album feat. Kool Keith as Dr. Octagon. Where's dan?
5,Perfect for little ones and big ones,"These chairs were very easy to put together and are the perfect size for my three-year-old and sturdy enough for adults to sit on, too. They look great with the other Mission-style furniture we have in our art room."
1,What a bunch of homers!,"Please, folks. I can only assume you are only loyal friends of the author, who seems very well-intentioned, but this is a bad, bad bit of self-published, derivative, embarrassing fantasy drivel. Just the apostrophes and choke-inducing nomenclature are enough to make one put it down, but it's just ... amateurish. There is a reason self-published authors can't find a real publisher all too often.Kudos to the author for putting the effort into this, but pretending this is professional quality is the province of friends, here, and not discerning readers.Ja'acob? Ugh."
2,one was great but the other was not.....,"Recently we went on a honeymoon safari in Africa and before leaving we had asked for these as part as our registry here on Amazon. I should have checked out both pairs before leaving but I figured that if they are brand new why should I have to. First day of the safari I went to zoom in and realized that the center focus ring was sliding in and out, it should not do this, it should only turn. I was wondering why I was having so many issues as to where my wife was not, her's were working fine. I was screwed and my only way to focus was to push/pull the center focus ring. As soon as we returned I contacted Barsaka's customer service months ago via email and still have not heard back. If you do purchase these make sure that they are working fine before you leave for your trip/outing."
4,Oldie but good information.,"The book was written in the 40's?. Techniques are good, some hazardous material mentioned (read intro). Tools illustrated match the tools I acquired at an estate sale from the same era so I can relate to the illustrations. Old tools but good technique."
5,More than mees the eye,I ordered this a week ago and was pleassantly suprised and how good the quality was. Watching this as a kid now having episodes forever on dvd..is something special and reason why the dvd format is popular. The package is neat the episodes are 1 to 25 in season two and it's worthwhile. Can't wait for season 2 part 2. I would recommend this product to anyone who even watched the show b4. Especially if you are in Canada this item is not available at Futureshop or any other stores.
4,DR Strings,"Nice sound a little too sharp for me, next time I'll try another brand like Dunlop. Eventhough very good sound."
2,Its about sound!!`,"The auto set is GREAT! However, it is too bad they did not use a better radio or maybe just a better antenna! If you like tin you will love this radio. Granted its job is to wake you up, and you will move very quickly to shut this thing off. But I like to sit and listen to NPR for a few minutes before I go downstairs for coffee. I tried moving this thing around the room just to get away from the crackle, no luck. I even tried tuning in to a top 40 super station better, but we still had tin and a bit of a crackle. I live 10 miles from downtown Columbus Ohio so we are not exactly in the sticks, and the radio signals to all other radios in the house come in load and CLEAR. This radio does hold the distinction of being the first item I have ever returned to Amazon - maybe you will have better luck with it - but I doubt it. It sure would be nice if they could make an easy to set, good sounding, reasonably priced clock radio. Consider the Sony ICF-C255RC ""Dream Machine"""
1,Very disappointed,"I replaced a 15-year-old Sony Dream Machine with this and eventually went back to the 15-year-old radio! This one has terrible sound and terrible reception. Everything sounds like its being broadcast from inside a tin can - the FM stations sound like AM stations (muffled, staticky). You can tune in a radio station at night and set the alarm to wake you to that station - by the morning, the radio has lost the station and you wake to static. This has happened to me over and over with several different stations. The dual-alarm feature is nice, but there are other radios that have two alarms. Don't waste your money on this - it is really junky!"
4,arrived on time,We saw the same line at Lowes but they didn't carry this item. We orderred it and it arrived promptly and in good condition.
4,Simply Charming,"At the crossroads of traditional folk music and chamber music, the Broadside Band has made an understated gem. The arrangments are delicate without sounding too precious, and Paul Elliott's and Patrizia Kwella's voices are ideal.Your best bet is buy the CD here on Amazon.com, because it is very difficult to find in stores and is often sold for more."
5,Adorable as Usual!,"As usual this Thomas DVD was a hit in our house. The DVD was short but it had four short fun-filled episodes. I think it is a perfect DVD to get us in the mood for spring time and kite flying! I also love the lessons that kids can learn from it such as working together and problem solving. I also love the CG animation so it seems like a regular animated DVD. Aidan was super excited to see Hiro from Hero of the Rails and that the trains talked, instead of just a narrator.I received this DVD to review but it is 100% my opinion."
4,The American Spirit,The desciptions and letters in this book are a great help in understanding exactly what was going on and how the people of the time period felt.
5,King of the Bop!,This CD is worth every penny. Im glad I bought it. Its stripped down rock 'n' roll at its best. Like Shane? Buy It!
4,Strong sophomore effort,"While definitely derivative (definite shades of Tolkien) and thus far, not quite achieving the intensity of the Kushiel series, still an enjoyable read. Carey has a talent for exploring our dark sides and for imagining political intrigue. Promising characters--Tanaros(!), Ushahin Dreamspinner and of course Satoris were favorites of mine; Cerelinde's character has potential but she felt flat/washed out and I'm finding it difficult to buy that Tanaros so quickly fell under her spell. Hopefully, Carey will develop her character more fully in the next volume. Still, I found it hard to put down and am eagerly awaiting the next volume in the series!"
3,Good story - but boring,"Let me first state that I loved the Kushiel's trilogy. I only mention this in order to say the J.Q. became one of my very favorite authors because of it. She not only captured my interest but held it and motivated it. HOWEVER.... Banewreaker failed to do this. It took me twice as long to read this book as a book this size normally does, why? because while it was a nice little story - it just completly failed to grab and hold my attention. The book was very easy to put down in favor of doing something else. There was a good story line here, there were good characters, places and events, it was worth finishing, but there are other books I would recommend before I thought about recommending this one (same goes for part II - Godslayer)."
3,Ten Great Lessons (outdated though),"This book is organized by ten lessons that cover all the things the software is capable of doing - flowcharts, organization charts, network diagrams, Ghantt charts, etc.. Ten chapters, each with a ten question quiz. That makes it different from the other Grabowski books. You learn by doing. And it comes with an excellent CD that has the 18 tutorials and files from the ten chapters. I found this approach worked better than the other books that I've seen. This book also has a large font, plenty of white space, and loads of graphics that are well placed and large enough to see - another difference from some of the other books available. Grabowski's book and CD makes this software easy to learn. If you do the lessons, which will not take much time at all, you can confidently say that you ""know"" Viseo.A lot has changed since this book was published. It was useful it its time but I don't recommend it now. Look for newer works by the author."
3,one size too small,"So, following the size of the scope, I ordered this. It is one size too small. It isn't worth it to return the cover. Oh well."
4,"Excellent, but...","I would not feed more than two sheets at a time. I also would not use this light duty unit for greater than ten minutes straight. Good for junk mail and old check shredding at home. Great value, medium quality."
3,Not a good fit,The legs and arms were too loose for my 5.75 year old twins in a size 4-6. Also the neck was too high and uncomfortable.
4,Good quality; work well for swim class and chilly days at the beach,"I'm pleased with the product for the price we paid. It isn't the finest quality, but it's certainly good enough for swim class and chilly days at the beach. I'd buy them again."
3,salvation is from the jews.,"It is an excellent overview of what the Jews feel today.It was very easy to read. I enjoyed reading it and learned a great deal, although his final conclusions are not in line with the teachings of the Catholic Church."
2,Such a dreadful reader,"This book is read by a voice that is shrill and penetrating. I persevered through the first CD - why is this reader so bad, what is the plot anyway, why am I wasting my time like this? Once the second CD started playing, and the reader blathered on about ""an attack of conscious,"" I woke up and ejected the CD.This is one of the worst audio CD books I've ever tried to listen to. I'll be quite happy to return it to the library on Monday.I put a wonderful Debbie Macomber book into the slot instead, and continued driving, listening to a mellow book, well read, with a good plot."
4,Naughty Neighbor,"I love Janet Evanovich's books - light, easy reading. Perfect for vacations.Can't wait to get her newest release.Live in PA - not far from Lawrenceville, Quakerbridge - where her Stephanie Plum novels are set."
1,Geez .. My Ears Are Bleeding,"I'm sure she's a lovely person, but C.J. Critt should not narrate books. I struggled through two of the four CDs, thinking I MIGHT get used to that awful voice, but I just couldn't do it. ""Overacting"" and ""Over the top"" are close, but just don't cover it. She's horrid. If she were reading books to children, I think even they would roll their eyes at the annoying inflection in this woman's annoying voice. I will run - FAST - from any book narrated by C.J. Critt. I don't care about those two people, and I don't even care about the pig, now. Who? Why? Don't care any more."
2,Super Cheesy!,"This was one of the cheesiest romance novels I've ever read. I can do cheese (I love Twilight for God's sake!) but this was over the top even for me. In addition to the romance plot line there was also a mystery plot line that seemed implausible and I had trouble following. People say that Evanovich is really funny but that wasn't true of this book.To be fair, this book was written pre-Stephanie Plum days and probably wouldn't have been rereleased if it wasn't for the success of the Stephanie Plum series. I've only read One for the Money and it was quite a bit better than this book.I listened to the audio version of this book and the narrator was not good. She had an overly theatrical voice that heightened the cheesiness level that much more. I may have liked this book better if I had read the paper version."
2,Not fun...,"From the start, I thought Louisa was ridiculously high-maintenance. She had the temper of a spoiled rich kid. And, really, this book was just a bit boring. She had long paragraphs of useless information about why someone did something, or their history, but it was unnecessary stuff that had no point. I flipped through pages a lot."
2,Just ok,I have read all of Janet Evanovich's book that she has out and this one I did not like this one the plot is extremely slow and all about a pig.
1,possibly the worst stick I've ever used,"On a whim and a touch of desperation I picked this up at a local shop, being the only stick I could find in town. I really regret doing so because it's just awful. ""Mush"" describes it well, mushy buttons, mushy stick, just mushy. This is due to the fact that everything on the stick is capable of operating in analog mode (why? this is an arcade stick for crying out loud!). Because of this, response time is greatly reduced in fighters and you've got to really throw the stick through its entire range before it will register.If you've ever used a nice stick like the ASCII FT (even the Agetech DC stick) or any of Happ's sticks in an arcade for any length of time, avoid this thing like the plague. You'll regret it as much as I do."
2,BCI-3e,i agree with others that the canon ink systems are too closely named. you would think that a BCI-3E would fit a system that uses BCI-3E inks. we now find that it fits BCI-32e systems.it is confusing and needlessly confusing.
1,Unhappy,"First of all, the package contained the wrong colors. THe black did not fit the printer. None of the cartridges produced ink. I had to throw them all the way. Lesson? If the price sounds too good to be true, beware.. A $15 lesson."
3,Not very universal.,"We bought this to keep in the diaper bag while we were potty training. I thought it would be great when we were at a public potty or at a friends house. Not so much... It did not fit a single public potty. It made it almost easier for her to fall with the seat than without. It did fit some of the ""home"" potties we tried it with, but I just was not that impressed. Our daughter loves that elmo is on it and it is very compact. I just wish it would fit to make it less likely that she would fall in a disgusting public potty."
4,It's all right for trips,"We're at the phase where we start to wenture out without diapers. Instead, I take this seat in the bag. It's flimsy, yes, but I'm there to provide some back support as well. I would not use it every day at home, but it has allowed us to have some freedom while keepin up with her PT progress, and so far, we've never had a bad experience with it. At 28lbs, though, my daughter is probably putting less stress than a bigger kid."
1,"Terribly flimsy, pinches and falls in!",This thing is terrible! It pinches my little one's skin in the places where the potty seat folds. It is also VERY flimsy. It starts sliding into the toilet if your little one wiggles at all. And it scoots when they try to sit on it.
2,Not worth the money,"This potty seat is great for portability, however my daughter won't use it. The hinges where it unfolds pinch her bottom. I didn't have a problem the few times she used it with it fitting on the toilet or anything like that though. I saw a similar folding potty seat in the One Step Ahead catalog - it's padded, so it says it won't pinch. That might be something to consider instead."
1,"Doesn't fit well, or stay on toilet seats, very weak strength","I have a small 2 1/2 year old who is already potty training. I bought this to have for use out side the home, traveling or at friends houses and stores etc. It's terrible. It shifts VERY easily and buckles under my 28 lb. toddler. VERY VERY unsafe. It also doesn't even fit on public toilet seats at all. Definitely, don't buy it."
1,Slip and Slide Gamble,"We purchased this to use while on a one week vacation and it was a disaster. The product does not stay well on top of the toilet seat - instead it slips around leaving mom or dad trying to catch their kid before they fall in or fall off. This item came as a combo set:Sesame Street Soft Potty, Travel and Step Stool Combo Set, Framed Friends. The other pieces are GREAT. We love the regular Soft Potty seat and the step stool. But, again, the travel seat we will no longer use as it does not stay in place while in use - ESPECIALLY for a wiggling toddler. The product description lists the travel seat as having ""non-slip rubber padding"" but it is a joke and does not work at all.Recap:This Travel Seat - NOSoft Potty Seat - YES"
2,Seemed okay at first,"I liked the idea of portability but the rubber grips do not do a very good job of keeping the seat from moving. The seat slides back too easily and since the hinges fold DOWN, the seat ends up falling in. Luckily the time my daughter was ON the seat when that happened I was right next to her and able to catch her. But another time, she was getting off and her arm fell in the toilet with the seat."
5,Mr. Adamski really talks with Masters in the Universe.,Mr. Adamski really did contact people from other worlds. He was disheartened by those who did not believe him. He was in the Washington D.C. area when he was supposed to have died and was buried on the same day. I think he just disappeared. I read his book many years ago...the early 1960's and was moved by his vivid description of his talks with the Master. Space travel was a given and he was one of the first to tell his story so well and to publish it. He was a very down to earth man who had some wonderful experiences. His book opened up my mind to all the wonderful possibilities in the universe. It was easy for me to accept that other worlds are populated. I beleive that this world has two camps: 1. those who can see how the unierse can be poplulated and 2. those who cannot believe there are people other than on the earth.
4,Amusing if placed in the proper context,"Since you cannot stop the inexorable passage of time leading to aging, the best thing you can do is to make jokes about it. This book contains a series of jokes about how one's thoughts and attitudes about the world changes as one ages. While they are in general amusing, as is usually the case with such collections, some of the jokes simply do not apply. The fact that one hits the age of forty means little to the modern person that works to preserve their physical and mental attributes.As long as they are interpreted as jokes and are not taken seriously, the contents of this book will amuse you, especially those that apply directly to your situation."
5,Mahler Meets a Master,"So far as I know, this is the only Mahler recording Skrowaczewski has made. It is so stunning that one wishes he would record this composer more often.Some years ago, I heard Skrowaczewski conduct the Minnesota Orchestra in the Mahler Second in Washington, D.C. The audience, usually worldly and blase to the point of rudeness, gave the performance a standing ovation. It was deserved.There is a relaxed, sunny lyricism about this reading which makes you want to play it over and over. Like other British orchestras, the Halle is not the first ensemble that comes to mind when you think of pairing Mahler with an orchestra, but the match is magic.Skrowaczewski holds the Mahler-Bruckner Medal and has been an international conductor for 40 years. He is currently Conductor Laureate of the Minnesota Orchestra, where he served as Music Director for 19 years.Alison Hargan, who is the last movement soprano, is not known to me, but she acquits herself with distinction."
2,very low budget flick. still looks good on blu,"This one is very low budget and that's what you get here. A movie that looks fine on blu ray but has NO CHAPTERS!. So they didn't even bother with that much on this release. THe film revolves around mutants created in labs that get loose and the budget is tiny , this is shlock but I like shlock movies. Still I can't say it's average shlock perhaps it's equal to alot of scy fy movies which I enjoy and which take the place of the old straight to vhs video days. It's probably a two and half on the low budget scale and a one star on a regular scale of movie critics ratings. ON blu ray there is no extras; but the picture looks great for such a movie. NO artifacts at all."
4,Useful for Night Sky Watching,"Lists how to view the stars and planets and their history and where to find them in the night sky.Nice photographs, lots of sky maps.You don't actually have to be a beginner astronomer to enjoy this as it makes very enjoyable reading just learning about the night sky."
1,A Warning.......DONT BUY,"I bought this item about 2 months ago. I took it on one trip with me and it worked fine. Every aspect of it was great, I like the look and the anti-skip. Then, on the second trip I took it on, I put in a new CD, and it didn't play. I figured it was the batteries, so I put in brand new batteries, and it still didn't work. Then, I tried to switch CDs, but it made no difference. Now, all the thing does is spin the CD for about 3 seconds, then say there is no disc. I think there is a problem with the laser, but I barely used the unit. I think that now on, I will get a personal CD player from a company that I know has a great reputation like Sony or Panasonic."
1,The Absolute worst,It would have been easier to throw [money] out the window of my car. It's very delicate to operate and heaven help you if you go over a bump or accidently move the player. It stops. It might go on again or not. Don't buy.....
1,mine didnt work at all,i just got mine today and it didnt work. it played the first part of the first song only on each cd i put in it. it couldnt play any other tracks. i called the factory and they said it had a bad laser. so watch out for bunk players from koss.
1,Completely lost until I read these reviews....,"We watched this movie and assumed there were two couples.....??????? until i read the reviews....even though we kept watching, we asked each other many times.....What in the world???? Actors were great, plot was okay, execution...not so great! will leave you scratching your head."
5,Light on Gambling,"This book is a great way to find experiences in Las Vegas inside and outside of the casinos. There are lots of suggestions for fun things to do when gambling wears off, or the kids (or you) need more interesting activities. Our children are grown with kids of their own, but we like the book for suggestions for us. You don't need kids to get a lot of value out of the book. The writing style is personal, humorous and fun. One of the best travel books I've ever read. The organization makes it easy to read from cove to cover, or to jump to a specific interest. If you are headed to Las Vegas you need this book."
1,Disappointing... boring...,"This is the second Susan Andersen book that I read. The first one, 'Baby, I'm yours' was great. I was looking forward to reading this one but what a disappointment. Beau is unprofessional and retarded. I'm only half way through the book and the story just goes around circles. How in the world did Beau jump to the conclusion that someone was trying to kill Juliet from the brake in his car being sabotaged? I don't even want to know how his solve the case."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"I was expecting Susan Andersen's next book to be as fast-paced and funny as ""Baby I'm Yours"" (which is one of the very best romance books I've ever read). All I can say is that this one didn't measure up. It was just ""okay""--worth reading, but not much to get excited about."
4,Laugh out loud funny,"This was my first Susan Andersen book but not my last. I really enjoyed it. I don't want to give anything away but I expected her to tie Beau and Celeste together by way of the Butler name. Celeste's reaction would have been a hoot. Anyway, I highly recommend this book."
3,Predictable romp through the big easy,"An heiress from Boston with far too many names is in New Orleans for a hotel opening and receives death threats from an unknown assailant. Macho cop Beauregard Dupree is assigned to protect her at the request of her overprotective father.Beau is looking forward to finally living la vida loca as a single man on the prowl. After his parents' death, young Beau kept the family together by being a guardian to his sisters. So it is time for him to step out and get a social life of his own.Sparks fly between the two though I am not sure how she knew what he was talking about with the thick New Orleans dialect built into the dialog. Soon, Beau is questioning whether there is room in his life for this new lady or if he wants to continue to play the field. I like her response to that.Totally predictable; you will know who the person writing the letters is almost from the star."
1,Worst DVD Ever Made,"This is the worst DVD I've ever seen by such a high margin it's ridiculous. It's some dumb metal head playing a riff, then playing it again in slow motion and not teaching you a single thing. The video quality is the worst I've ever seen on any video in my life and every segment begins with a huge line that rolls across the screen. The budget for the enitre thing must have been the cost of the metal head's lunch at McDonald's. I feel like I just threw $20 into a gutter."
2,For Stanwyck and Sterling Hayden fans only,"I'd like to give it three stars but can't. It's a silly story line about climbing to fame and fortune in the world of police detectives. It's not a becoming role for Barbara Stanwyck, and Sterling Hayden just stands there and looks his sexy, handsome self. Stanwyck's outfits are very nice and one wonders how she affords such good looking outfits on a policeman's salary. Still it's interesting to watch. If you're a fan of film noir, Sterling Hayden and Barbara Stanwyck you won't be too disappointed."
1,Pitiful mats,These mats were pitiful. The top immediately seperated from the backing. The backing has since crumbled. All in just a matter of a couple of months. I wish I hadn't bought them.
3,Caring for a mother with dementia,"As the incidence of dementia rises, so do the books on the subject. But Robert Tell's `Dementia Diary: Caregiver's Journal' stands out for its cracking pace and searing honesty. Many families will identify with the events he records as his mother's dementia depeens, yet the strength of his own personality and his relationship with his mother makes this book truly unique. When he asks, `Is this the mother who made me crazy all those years when her emotions were out of control? Or is this gentle and loving paragon of happy old age the true, underlying person?' you want to reassure him that yes, this is Minnie as she could have been without the stressors that made her so volatile. For dementia is a journey, through the mind, through the heart to the spirit of the person, the very essence of the being. Robert describes his mother's journey incredibly well.Louise Morse"
4,Husband really liked this DVD!,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He uses a trainer in the winter. He liked it so well he purchased two others.
5,Great guide for new coaches,"As a new coach, it is easy to get overwhelmed with all the expert advice available to get your practice up and running. Steve's book was recommended by another coach and proved just the thing I needed to focus my efforts. As a Master Coach, Steve has a wealth of experience to draw on and provides a straight forward, actionable guide to marketing success. I would recommend his book to new coaches as well as those coaches who need to fine tune their marketing efforts."
1,"Et tu, Mr. Coffee?",I'll keep it short and (un) sweet (ened):-Leakage aplenty-Heating element died after 14 months-Clock was consistently inaccurateOne star for being at least minimally functional for a year and change.
2,Coffee Brew is weak,"Sure it looks pretty, but the coffee that it brews is so weak even if using the ""strong"" brew setting. I had a great Delonghi coffee maker which I had to give away as it was taking a lot of counter space, and what a difference in the taste of coffee between the two coffee makers. Save your money, pass on this coffee maker, and get something better."
1,Not hot enough = bad coffee,"I bought this as a replacement for my Cuisinart because I wanted to save money. At first I thought maybe something was wrong with my tastebuds but after using this a few days, I decided this maker does not brew good coffee. I believe this is because the water does not get hot enough. And forget about sneaking that first cup before it's done brewing...lukewarm at best and tastes terrible. This is going back and I'll spend a little more for something else."
1,Quit working in less than 6 months!,Ok so I have been through 2 of these machines. Both simply stopped working in less than 6 months. I used the maker one morning and that evening it wouldnt brew. I will never buy another Mr. Coffee product after this.
1,They need to recall this piece of junk,"My first mr. coffee (FTX41) I purchased leaked probably a third of the amount I poured in. I stupidly thought I could fix it, but you basically have to break the plastic shell to get in to see where it is leaking. I very stupidly bought the same model again thinking it was a random problem, but sure enough, my brand new model leaked right away. My in-laws have the same model and it drives them nuts with all of the leaking and problems with the carafe. Please do not buy this piece of junk. It will drive you nuts."
2,leaky,"cons: leaks when the lid is opened from condensation (even up to 24 hours after brewing), rubber stopper in back leaks water through the center hole, ""water filter"" is a pain in the butt and doesn't fit properly over the reusable coffee filter, clock can only be viewed when directly perpendicular with it, have to click through ""brew now"" to get to ""delay brew""pros: makes a decent cup of strong coffeea ruined countertop due to the multiple leaks ensured this coffeemaker a trip back to the Costco that it was purchased at."
1,5 months and it blew,After having this same coffee maker for 2 years we decided to re-buy as we did like the look. The previous one began to randomly brew only 4-6 cups of the 12 which we would have to restart to continue to brew. It also began to leak water all over the counter. The clock had quit after only about 1 year. The coffee is VERY slow to brew but the flavor was o.k.Big mistake to re-buy!!The second time we bought the coffee pot just made a loud pop and the entire 12 cups of water leaked all over after only 5 months.WARNING!!! Stay away from this coffeemaker. I wish we had learned the first time.
2,Not too impressed,"Have had this pot about 6 months. The pot does make good flavor coffee. It does look nice. There are some things I don't like and thus only 2 stars. (1) The coffee immediately after brewing is just warm despite cranking the heat to max. I frequently have to microwave a fresh cup. Give it 20 minutes and its hot however (2) The lid to the carafe does not attach securely. It frequently falls off when getting the last cup. Have to keep my thumb on it to fix that. (3) After the brew cycle is complete, the coffee maker boiler continues to cycle attempting to heat nonexistant water. I have to put up with nearly a half hour of periodic gurgling. It would seem not too hard to program the electronics to turn off the boiler until the brew switch is cycled again for goodness sake (4) The clock LCD contrast is now so low I can barely see the parts that are suppose to be black."
1,Didn't like at all!,"The can opener does not swing tight and once installed, kept swinging out instead of staying stowed. I bought it because it was so highly rated, but I am very disappointed. There is no magnet to hold the can lid either. Although it was intended to save space, it is kind of a clunky eyesore."
5,just like old times,"The swingaway was as good as I remember growing up, strong, simple and sturdy..The low price is fantastic..dont understand way you cant find them in stores anymore..probably because of all of the chineses garbage out there..The Swingaway is made in the good old USA...buy it."
3,"It's ok, but we returned it","It was a little big. It was a little wide too so it would end put laying on it's side when she wore it. The blue was is a nice color though. I got her another one that was smaller with real diamonds. It cost me $300 bucks so it cost more, but she like it a lot more. Probably because it's diamonds. I am looking for another nice one with her birth stone on it now."
4,Cute little piece,"I got this for my wife's birthday. I like the size of the pendant, the flow and feel of it. But beware - you will need to upgrade the necklace (but face it, at this price you knew that already).The stones all match in color, and do make a beautiful statement. The only reason why this isn't a 5-star is because the purple was not quite as deep or radiant as I would have liked it to be, they seemed a little washed out. But (as far as I can tell) she doesn't care!"
2,just aaight,couple mcs had skills. many didn't.no known names outside of tunnel rats (rather unknown themselves).couple ok bboys. i'd give the continuity a 2 and editing a 2 out of 5. much better out there. check freestyle on palm pictures.
5,Think about the long term,"This is a good long term purchase for the following reasons1) Can charge multiple items without having bulky chargers for each one. I keep tips for our cell phones and ipod in the car2) Upgrade or change cell phones/other electronics? No need to buy another charger, just a little tip. Less to throw out, a little more eco friendly in the long run"
4,"Telephony Anytime, Anywhere - Instruction Book Required","Like it or not, mobile cellular phones and their owners have become part of the landscape, and to paraphrase Pogo, ""We have met the enemy, and it is the loudmouthed cellular user."" Author Peter Laufer to the rescue: ""People jut need to use common sense."" Through historical context, New Yorker cartoons, and interesting anecdotes, Laufer points out the impact that the use of phones in certain environments, such as crowded elevators, may have. Technology of developers faster than its users do - hence the need to bring the issue of cellular phone courtesy to the forefront of dinner-table conversation and water-cooler banter.We liked this book enough to name it a VB:Book-of-the-Week in our weekly e-mail technology briefing, VB:TechWatch."
5,Great outlet strip,This outlet strip served our purpose exactly. We had 7 two way radios to plug in for school
5,Multiple Outlet strip,"This is a great alternative to connection multiple power strips. The cord is LONG and because the plugs are spread apart, it is easy to get lots of items on it. It comes with screws for mounting but I just put it on the top of the table. The price is way less than the local electronics shop, at least in L.A. County.Comment"
1,rusts,This can opener works perfectly but the two gripper and cutting spoked wheels rusted early on. This can opener got a top rating from a consumer products review show but I wish I owned a can opener that didn't rust.
2,Jobs to China,"This is a good can opener. However it is now made in China, whereas the identical model had been made in the USA. I cannot support companies that participate in the erosion of the American manufacturing base and will no longer buy Swing-A-Way. If you feel the same, be alerted; if you do not, this is still a good quality product."
2,overrated,"We've had one of these for about 5 years, and I'm about to toss it--it used to work well, but I can't get it to go all the way around a can and end up prying everything open. My husband always talks about them being used in space, but I have to wonder if they really take canned goods up there..."
5,Excellent can opener - the best,"Its just a can opener, sure. But its the best I have ever used. The can opener I had was becomming difficult to use and wasnt opening cans well. This is so easy and smooth. There is some effort to turn the handle but hardly and resistance. It cut cleanly all around and doesnt leave a spur.Its a pleasure to use. $10 may seem a lot of money when you can buy one for $2 or less but once you use it your be glad you spent the money.It has a bottle top opener on the side, which wont probably ever be used, but its there if someday you may need it.The biggest thing missing is that there is no hole on the top to hang the can opener from a nail or hook in your kitchen. You need to put it away in a drawer when your not using it. Other than that its a great product and recommended. Spend the money."
5,Like butter,"I don't know about ""ergonomic."" It just seems more thickly padded, and that's a good thing. The ease and smoothness of use is a revelation after struggling for years with a so-called ""Good Grips."""
1,Does a fine job of shredding the lip of cans,"My old swing-a-way opener lasted for many years but was lost on a vacation trip. I ordered this one to replace it. What a piece of junk. It skips off the can leaving the lid firmly attached at 2 or 3 places. Efforts to go back over those spots result in a disfigured can and a still attached lid. I am then forced to pry the lid off with a screw driver leaving jagged shards of metal protruding from the edges of the can. Thank goodness I bought the ""comfort grip"".Sure its only $10 but it bothered me enough to try to get amco swing-a-way to replace it. Even Google can't find a contact # for these charlatans. Don't waste your money."
1,Disappointed,Purchased this to replace a six year old Swing-A-Way Model 709. What a piece of JUNK. Terrible quality can not reliably open a can.
4,Can't beat a Swin Away,Good old reliable and it makes a clean cut. Ergonomic handle is questionable.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!,"Dissapointed....When i got to chpt.29 & i realized there were only a few pages left.A Story i didn't want to end!!!!!. Thanks ""IKE"""
5,I'm a fisherman not a bookworm.... this was good!,"Ike talks about his life, and career in vivid detail. From his earliest fishing memories to winning the Classic a couple years ago. My favorite thing about the book is the fact that he wants to make YOU a better fisherman/angler. He shares loads of valuable information, and demonstrates how it works."
5,Great book for the boys/men in your life!,"I bought this for my husband as a gift to get him ready for an upcoming fishing trip. Here's a guy who isn't opposed to reading per se, he just loses interest quickly. HE LOVED IT! Picked up some good tips and then passed it on to his father who LOVED IT too!Can't miss with this one girls!"
1,Flops like a Fish,"Contains precious little information about fishing, i.e. you're not going to learn much, and overall, it's just irritating...just like it's namesake. Iaconelli refers to himself as a ""tatted-out break-dancing"" rebel, lol...if I did that type of dancing, I wouldn't brag about it. A total waste of time and money."
3,Decent but not Spectacular,"Full disclosure...I had only read about the author in Bassmaster magazine or watched him on ESPN, so I had a negative opinion about Mike before I ever picked up his book. However, that doesn't mean that he doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to catching bass. He had many valid points about the world of professional bass fishing. The material about his personal life (e.g., divorce and his sexual conquests) did not really add anything to what he had to say, but all in all it was a pretty good effort. Mike, I don't hate you any more. I just think you are emotionally immature."
2,so-so prep book,"I was very excited with the book until I came to the practice test section. I found that many ideas not covered in the review sections were included. I also discovered many typos in the practice questions and the answer key. I found this frustrating because I am trying to hone my skills before the test, and many of the questions and the answer key contain serious errors. I feel like I am better prepared for having read this book, but I really think they should have spent a LOT more time proofreading."
1,"SERIOUS TYPOS, answers to practice test out of order???","This book is full of typos. It gives you a full practice test but many of the questions make no sense. When looking up the explaination of the answers, I found the book offered explainations for the wrong questions. I have spent hours taking a practice test, and I honestly can't assess how well I've done. This book is USELESS AND CONFUSING!!! If only no stars were an option."
2,For Jeep Rangler,"i bought this for my car [Nissan Sentra] and it was too small for to fit the back seat, only until i got it i found out it was made for Jeep Rangler, this is not such a universal set.I still managed to make it fit by cutting out the ends but some of the back seat is not covered.If you're buying this for your Jeep i reccomend it because it's of top quality."
1,Do not waste your money,"I wouldn't recommend this. Not sure if my DVD was defective, but it didn't play 3D. Something was wrong with it. I didn't contact the seller about it, because it wasn't that expensive, and really wasn't worth my time."
1,More like a video game,"Not only does this feel like you're watching a video game just from the graphics (think ""Doom"") but you're riding along with the main character but you never see him (I think the intention was to make you feel like you are going thru the movie yourself, but you don't). It's also very slow and quite boring. Couldn't even finish watching it."
1,Simply aweful,"I took the kids -- 8 and 10 -- to see this a couple of Halloweens ago. It may be the worst movie I've seen. The kids hated it. It appears to be an excuse to make a 3-D film, so there are lots of irrelevant roller-coaster effects, etc. The plot is inane, bordering on offensive (frequent torture scenes). A complete waste of your time and money."
3,pretty good stuff from one of the greats,im a bit dissapointed that so many of his live songs are cut short. why not let us watch the entire song?
4,Central Valley,I like that Moonshine Bandits is doing something a little different than the beaten path. I like the music and what they represent.
5,Timeless romance...definitely a keeper!!!,"This is the 1st book I read from this author & for the price I had decided to give her a try. I was so glad I did. I laughed & cried; I just simply couldn't put it down. Ms Ryan is an exceptional writer & an amazing storyteller. The plot is real, the characters are real and the writing flows so well that left me thoroughly content after finishing this book. I know I will read it again. I highly recommend this."
2,Not a reading book!,"I ordered this thinking it was a reading book to be read to young children. It is basically a coloring book with some other activities. If there is a readable story, I failed to find it."
2,Predictable Palmer Story....*Yawn*,"I've now read 14 Diana Palmer books...and I can easily say that most of them follow the same formulatic premise. First off, is there ANY Palmer book where the woman isn't a virgin (or had her virginity taken from her by a bad guy)? These simpering virgins can never stand up for themselves & if they ever attempt to do so, it's with a completely lame comeback or attempt. Second, ALL of the leading men have some sort of social issue...surly, cranky, jerky doofuses - but somehow the virgin always falls for the jerk...no matter how poorly he talks to her or treats her. Can anyone say ""Doormat""? ARGH! For once, I'd love to see Palmer try something new...use her writing skills to write a strong female lead and a non-jerk man. She's a good writer....it's just too bad it's often wasted on rehashing the same old thing."
3,This is NOT the original book - it's been edited.,This is NOT the original book from the Montana Mavericks series. Well.. I guess it is but it has been edited and parts of the on-going storyline for the Montana Mavericks series have been taken out. If you are looking to replace your original Montana Mavericks books or get them on your kindle you will be disappointed since it appears they are being re-edited.
4,"Travel Charger Set (2 pieces) fits Creative Zen Micro Photo, Neeon MP3 Players",Good product; good price.
4,To Colorado Springs,"Congratulations to the reader from Colorado Springs who has finally found in her ultimate wisdom the causes behind breast cancer. I will refrain from the names I would like to call you and only speak from my experience. My mother died from breast cancer three years ago at age 52, was diagnosed at 49. She was the most fit, healthy, vibrant woman you would ever meet and ate great. Was on the stairmaster for an hour a day. If criticizing Somers and not following her plan makes you and your women friends and family feel better and safer from breast cancer, then be my guest. However, bringing the subject of this author's personal stuggle in a review of her book is inappropriate, unfounded nutritionally and downright meanspirited. Shame on you. Ms. Somers programs is not for everyone but has helped a lot of people to become healthier eaters."
1,Tapping into America's Fat Habit,"Suzanne Somers, unfortunately, is making money by telling us what we think we want to hear: eat such foods as deep-fried turkey, and look slim, svelte, and sexy. The truth is a bit harder for us to swallow: we need to eat smaller portions, we need to learn to like food that is low in fat, and we need to exercise regularly. No big secrets, just a bit of common sense and discipline."
2,Get Real!,"It is hard to take seriously a writer who is concerned about our ingestion of sugar, white flour, potatoes(!) and carrots(!) but encourages the use of artificial sweeteners like saccharin and her embryonic ingredients-yet-to-be-named SomerSweet. If you need encouragement getting off the white stuff, read William Dufty's Sugar Blues, a much better read and a more convincing argument against the use of sugar."
1,NEVER RECEIVED.. BUYER BEWARE,"I never received this book, and I sent them a message about it and they never responded."
3,A little disappointing...,"If I had known that so much of Eat Cheat was an exact word for word rehash from Get Skinny I wouldn't have bought it. I thought that was a little tacky. Also I was extremely disappointed that the Somersweet that was so hyped & raved about by Suzanne in the book is not available yet. And even worse, it is not made from the wonderful ingredients she described in the book! Her website explains that they decided to change it. Evidently it is just going to be a form of fructose. That is really unprofessional in my opinion to offer a product that doesn't exist. I do like Suzanne very much & I enjoy the pictures of her & her family. I don't resent her for being successful, rich, beautiful, ect. and I wish her well."
4,"good, clean, fun","Lindy is the voice of one of the most popular cartoon characters on primetime television. It makes it difficult on a date when her escort asks what she does for a living because a request to ""do the voice"" always follows. Do they like her for her? Or the character she plays. Leo is a network executive who has been sent to save Lindy's show in the midst of bad ratings. The colorful cast of characters is rounded out by Nigel, the show's British creator whose scripts aren't what they used to be. Marilyn, Nigel's iguana, makes a Technicolor appearance. Kyle, one of the men in Lindy's life who can't seem to separate Lindy from her character.This is an entertaining novel filled with humor and Christian values that encourages the reader to ask herself, ""what's important in my life?"""
2,NOT the Elizabeth Montgomery film,"I skipped reading the product summary when I saw prior review from another person stating that this was the Elizabeth Montgomery film on this story. My mistake for not having been more careful.However, to insure others don't get confused or purchase in error, PLEASE note that this title is merely an old ""Biography"" episode narrated by Peter Graves that reviews the events with help of clips, news stories of the day and photos, plus present-day historians.Very disappointing, and an expensive (nearly $30) mistake on my part. Wanted to be sure no one else makes the same error based on the mistaken user review..."
5,Good old book.,"You can find the references to this work in any paper in nonlinear mechanics! Book is small, but it's cool! I like to have it my home library."
4,Very helpful,The book provides a very good and concise review of vector calculus. Also helpful is the context of electricity and magnetism making it a good companion book the advanced E&M class at my school [as it is recommended for]. Also good for learning Vector Calculus on its own.
5,A MUST HAVE for the parents of LD child!,"I borrowed this book from the library and then I'm here now to buy it for my own. This book goes through each type of disability, how they are identified and will guide you through the maze of school testing, IEP's, and how to be your child's advocate to make sure they are getting everything they should be getting from their education! Great detail on emotional growth, planning for the future and assessment measures!"
3,Delicious by high arsenic level,"I have only been drinking protein shakes since April, so I'm a little bit of novice to this. I have always liked the Muscle Milk pre-made shake so I decided to try the powder. The taste of this chocolate drink was the best of the four powders I have tried thus far. It is has a very nice rich chocolatey flavor. Unfortunately, I discovered from other Amazon reviews and Consumer Reports that this drink has the highest arsenic levels."
2,picture is misleading,it's not the big bottle its the medium bottle. the picture is misleading. if i knew it was the medium bottle i wouldnt have bought it. 2 stars for muscle milk. -3 stars for misleading picture
4,Good,"I love the vanilla taste, it goes well with vanilla soy milk which is a plus. A little chalky but then again its powder so what did you expect."
2,Waste,They are not clear.on the mix. The scoop size is 70cc. The directions say 2 scoops for a serving but if you look closer a serving is 75cc. ??? Then after you do that it doesnt mik well taste is not the best and all for 20g of protein which is less than others i prefer... Wont buy again
4,"Great, but not perfect","I bought this because of all the hype. It is a very popular protein product that claims to help burn fat when mixed with exercise and tastes great.I've been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I recently stopped taking the GNC brand protein to try this. Now, it does taste really good, but is difficult to mix without a blender. With the strawberry flavor at least, you get clumps, especially if you are lactose and use Soy Milk. Mixed with cold water, it's not as bad, but you won't get the same taste.It does taste good, but you'll get bored with the flavor after a few days, so chocolate may be the way to go. I've only been building for about six months now, and I try to consume my weight in protein, so I would like to see a little more protein per scoop, but for those just starting out, or just can't stand the taste of most protein products, this may be for you.I also recommend some stuff by EAS."
2,"Tastes decent, not the most expensive, but upsets my stomach","This brand of powder has a lot of the qualities you'd want in a protein. However, there have been reports of heavy metal levels. This brand upsets my stomach and makes me feel nauseous. I found another brand that is cheaper per gram of protein, as good quality, mixes better, and doesn't hurt my stomach. It's the optimum nutrition chocolate flavor. I wish I could return these (I bought a few flavors being dumb)."
2,Too much sugar and fat,"I'm not sure how the marketing department for Muscle Milk comes across with Lean Protein for this stuff, but it's loaded with fat and sugar...things you probably don't want to be ingesting if you're serious about working out.Stick to NATURE'S BEST, ISOPURE CHOC (LOW CARB) 3LB, it's a little more expensive, but you get more for your money and it's a hell of a lot better for you, and for Caesin theOptimum Nutrition 100% Casein Protein, Chocolate Supreme 2 Poundis the way to go."
3,Can't taste the difference here- simply chocolate taste,"I was thrilled to locate a ""Brownie Batter"" flavored health item, as I'm smitten with the frozen high-calories varieties (such as DQ and Ben and Jerry's. Unfortunately, I have made this twice so far and do not taste any thing other than regular chocolate flavor. Nothing of that distinctive ""brownie"" and ""batter"" taste that I've enjoyed in other products. I have some regular Chocolate flavored Muscle Milk, so perhaps I should do a blind taste test. So far however, it was more a nice idea than actual flavor I'm sorry to say."
4,Good price for a good product,"While I am far from an expert on nutritional suppliments, this one seems to work as advertised (although, for all I know, it could also simply be a placebo effect!)"
3,"Tastes great, but wasn't effective.","I purchased this based upon other reviews I've read. I was taking the GNC Pro Performance AMP Amplified Wheybolic Extreme 60(tm) prior to purchasing this product. I was hoping to get the same results at a much lower price. I'm on my second jug of Muscle Milk and I haven't seen much of an improvement in my workouts. I typically take this after workouts 4 - 5 days a week, but what I've noticed is that I haven't been able to increase the amount of weight I'm lifting nearly as much as I was with the GNC powder. Bottom line is that I just don't feel that this has been effective for me. The plus side is the taste. Delicious."
5,Must have.,I can't work out without Muscle Milk. It's great product. A must buy for everyone who exercises!
2,read warnings!,Unfortunately I needed to gain weight after spinal surgery. After 4 doses I developed edema in my ankles and feet. Buyer beware>
3,Does not taste like I expected,Doesn't taste like I expected. Tastes like blueberries with a hint of metal. Hmmm. Common to all muscle milk but doesn't go good with blueberries.
5,Yummy!!!,The taste is shockingly delicious and I notice my recovery time is cut in half and good muscle gains this is my new and only protein shake now.
4,A Woman of Conviction,"This is an amazing story of a truly remarkable woman, Juliette de Bairacli Levy, and her journey from everyday to extraordinary. A woman, quiet and loving in nature, who learns the way of herbs and their curative powers to help animals, children and humanity. Her story is an inspiration to all of us in making a life choice and how one person with deep convictions can make a real difference in the world, even today. Learn and be inspired!"
4,A life well lived,"The production values of this documentary are a little basic, but this is the story of a loving, and much loved woman whose life was a little rough around the edges. Juliette de Bairacli Levy's inspirational life as a herbalist and animal healer is summed up rather briefly in this documentary (a mere 75 minutes), and it feels like there is much more to be told about the life of this beautiful person.If I feel a bit disheartened or directionless, watching this woman's motivational story turns me around very quickly. Juliette's story and spirit serve as a guiding light, a reminder to live sustainably and be more connected with nature and the animals."
3,OK,"Folds up, good for travel. Does not fit any toliets that I have come into contact with. My daughter won't use it, but she is picky. I keep it, maybe one day it will come in handy."
2,"Doesn't cover entire toilet seat, Weak, flimsy.","I just bought the Dora folding potty seat today at Walmart. It doesn't cover the entire toilet seat. It starts at the front of the toilet, and doesn't go all the way to the back. The result is that there is no support in the back. My daughter is 3 yrs, 4 months, and this seat is much too weak for her. Any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back. I'm afraid that if we use it, it will soon break and she'll fall in. She definitely can't sit back, or even sit straight up because it sinks so much. I'm returning it and I'm going to look for something else."
4,Works Like A Charm,"The folding potty seat is great when on the go a lot. I have two older boys in baseball and I am trying to get my 2 yr old girl to use the potty. Having this folding seat, I am able to use any public toilet with no worries. Plus--she loves Dora."
3,"Entertaining Camp, but not enough of Al Hirt on trumpet","The beauty of ""Beauty and the Beat"" is its camp-appeal. What could be more fun than beautiful Ann-Margret singing in her perky-you-can-tell-she's-smiling way, joined by big ol' hairy Al Hirt? Ann-Margret's performance is, well, vintage mid-1960s sex-kitten. If you loved her in ""Viva Las Vegas,"" this might be right up your alley. Al Hirt's vocals are actually quite good (for a trumpeter). If you're a fan of Hirt's New Orleans style trumpeting and his hits such as ""Java,"" ""Cotton Candy,"" ""Sugar Lips,"" and ""Fancy Pants,"" you might be disappointed to find that he seems to be singing here more than he's playing. If you don't mind hearing Hirt's vocals with limited solos on trumpet, then you will enjoy the CD very much. Certain numbers are charming by any standard: ""Personality"" stands out, as does ""Everybody Loves My Baby (But My Baby Don't Love Nobody But Me)."""
1,A sad chapter in Jacos' life beter left unrecorded.,"For those not familiar with Jacos life it goes something like this: artist 'invents' the fretless bass; artist propels super-group (weather report) to commerical and musical success; artist is hailed as ""worlds greatest bass-player""; artist falls prey to substance abuse and mental illness; finially, artist is murdered. Along with Bird and Nijinsky, Jaco helped fuel the 'great artist as madman' to the point of cliche. His life was marked by incredible highs and equally incredible lows. Saddly the marerial was recorded when Jaco was all but 'gone' and, should never have been released. Please pass on this and buy any of his incredible CDs with W.R. or Jonie Mitchell."
4,Clearly explains how nutrition can benefit athletes,"Easily understandable without being condesending or incomplete.More than just Vitamin A,B&C , this is a calorie and this is a carb etc. It goes how the body works and why it recommends X Y or Z. Armed with this knowledge you can make informed decisions about nutrtion. I would recommend every athlete read this book.BUT and there is always a but, when I read this book in 95 it was out of date then on a number of subjects.Foor example creatine which is one of the most effective substances for athletes in training is discounted !.Until this book it updated it cannot be the 'Bible of sports Nutrition'.If it was updated it would be awsome."
2,Read with a grain of salt,"While I was intially impressed with the book, it did gnaw on me why the book pushes TwinLab products throughout, and all other kinds of supplements. If you take all the supplements in the book your bill will be in the hundreds of dollars. Then after further research, I discovered TwinLab published and the book and the author gets paid by them to write on a monthly basis. Unfortunately that taints all the findings in the books, and explains why so many supplements are pushed. If Colgan was honest, he would have exposed his relation with the Lab upfront, which would have made me a lot less suspicious."
5,Progressive Drum & Bass Experimentation....,"....with the splendid vocal delivery and artistry of Coppe. This is probably her most energized album, full of heady beats and unusual background ambience; from Satie-esque piano interludes to full-fledged hyper-beated groove fests. This album deserves the attention of all connesseurs of electronic musical collaborations in dreamtime and vaporspace. Take a deep breath and allow the Coppe-vibes to wash all over your body. An electro-erotic experience for all willing and adventurous listeners."
5,Very moving portrait of Prague during WWII,"This book opens with a black humor scene: how to remove the statue of Mendelssohn from the Prague concert hall during the Nazi occupation? From there, it shifts to short portraits of the gestapo, guards, ghetto residents, children, etc., all living in Pragu and trying to succeed/survive. It has been a long time since I have read a book so moving as this, and I highly recommend it"
4,Couldn't go to sleep until I finished it!,It's been a while since a book I was reading was so enthralling that I stayed up til the wee hours to finish it. This book is exceptionally dynamic and compelling as I was drawn along with the story. A wonderful read
5,I LOVE THIS SET.,"I just got mine about 2 weeks ago and love it. I AM NOT a gamer and use it for hi def cable and dvds. This TV makes analog signals look great and the hi def is crystal clear. I had a problem with the HDMI connection but once connected to RGB it is working great. (I also had problems with HDMI on my older Toshiba 50"" and in this case I think it is a cable issue.) Sound is also good. I would definitely buy this set again. I have had no problems with image retention but am careful to try to maximize the image on the screen which is easy with the ratio control. Overall 5 stars for me."
5,A powerful account of a Chicana/o community in Texas,"This is a beautifully written memoir by one of our best Chicana writers. Seizing upon Roland Barthes's writings on photography, Cantu reconstructs her childhood on the U.S./Mexican border, teaching us that the border itself is an artificial barrier. This is a moving story of an American family that has worked hard and sacrificed much. We can only hope that the rest of America will recognize sooner than later the enormous contributions to U.S. history made by Mexican Americans."
1,Just a bad book...,"When I was forced to read Ms. Cantu's book for her class I opened it with an open mind and was at the beginning interested in what she had to write about. Boy was I mistaken and regretful when I wasted 3 hours of my life reading this. She jumps around from different points in her life and adds fiction when it gets to boring. Save yourself time and money and don't buy her book while in turn supporting anymore of this nonsense called ""Chicano literature""."
3,Excellent,"I loved this CD! I went back to listen to the previous CD and immediately noticed a difference. Joann's music and voice has matured and I can tell that there is a deeper level of anointing and adoration for our King. I am brought to tears time and time again when I listen to such songs as When I Pray, I Hear You Say, God, My Desire and With all My Heart. I don't understand a word of Spanish, but feel the power of the anointing in JoAnn's voice as she ministers Cuando Reposo En Ti. And get my ""praise on"" along with my 15 month old son as he claps his little hands every time to Open My Eyes Lord and Psalm 27. I listen to this CD at least once a day and have gotten my husband and all of my friends ""hooked"".I'm definitely looking forward to her next release as I know it will only get better and God will be glorified!"
1,Sexually Explicit,"I wish I would've read ALL the reviews before purchasing. Unfortunately, I was so taken with the theme of the book I failed to see them (as it was recommended by Amazon!) Needless to say, even if I would've seen the reviews, it wouldn't prepare me for the volumes words dedicated to body parts, sex, etc. Definitely not for the coffee table...or the book case, for that matter."
2,Not in the same genre',"I have all of the Celtic Twilight series and found both #6 & #7 to be a departure from the quiet beauty that marked the first CD's in the series. If there is a #8, I will preview it, but will not promise a purchase, until after the preview."
2,A bit limited,"If you love lamb, this is the cookbook for you. But if you are looking for more, and in particular if you are searching for side dishes or vegetarian recipes, you will be disappointed. Some of the recipes call for ingredients not readily found in the US."
4,Nice read,"The book is a short read, 144 pages. It has a nice assortment of black and white photos, no color photos except the front and back covers. If you have been following Angelina for some time now, you'll already have seen most of these photos. Most of the photos are either screen shots and promotions, or from various award ceremonies. As a long time fan of Angelina, I was surprised to see that this book had a good bit of information on her that I didn't already know. There's a lot of quotes from magazines. The author breaks down most of Angelina's movies, and I do think he spends a tad too much time describing the other actors in these movies. Either way, it is a cheap book and a nice addition to a fan's collection, also a great read for the brand new fan. I recommend!"
2,nothing new here,"Ordered the book to find out something new about Angie. Well, it was dissapointment- there was nothing new I could learn about Angelina. And the book wasn't that interesting to read generally."
5,"This IS GREAT, TRUST ME , BY:EDWIN MONTANEZ","This is a great film, and the acting is great also. Especially from Scott Gurney. Trust me, it is good. The story is very good and it is sad also. At first, you see why someone would be attracted to Johnny Rebel, he is great looking and very attractive, but later, after you get to see how Johnny really is, you wonder why anyone would be attracted to him. He is a conceided jerk that only cares about himself. This film takes you deep into the gay porn industry and let's you see a lot. The story is great, and the acting is phenomenal. The actors in this film are very believable, and you believe they are the characters they are playing. I only saw this fim because I caught it on cable one night, and decided to watch it. I am hapy I did because I truly enjoyed it, and I am a hetero-sexual male. People, watch this film, it wont win oscars, but it deserves a few.-EDWIN MONTANEZ"
1,Jumping On An Idiotic Bandwagon,"Horrible. Tries very hard to be ""Boogie Nights,"" which wasn't so great a flick to begin with. People will love it."
3,Fluffer was daring but falls apart towards the end,"Alas, I finally got in to see ""The Fluffer"" during it SF run at the theatre it was being screened at. The movie did build up to its story plot line but suddenly stalls towards the end and falls apart. Main character ""Sean"" played by Michael Cunio was pretty much setting himself up thinking that his favorite idol ""Johnny Rebel"" played by Scott Gurney will fall into his arms and live hapilly ever after."
2,BORING MOVIE,"I bought this dvd, thinking it was going to be intertaining. Well, it wasnt. Far from it, dosent have much of a story, the actors are ok. Wouldnt waste money on this movie."
3,it's kind of a good Racing Wheel.,The MadCatz Racing Wheel is kind of good but I don't like it as much as other Racing Wheels because When I choose digitl mode or steering mode.in the middle of the game it changes to analoge mode and some people don't like analoge mode with there Racing Wheels but other then that it's a preety great Racing wheel.
5,This kicks butt!,"This wheel is so good for a game like Gran Turisimo 2 where no two turns are the same and each turn you need to handle differently. The fact that you can make more suitable for a advanced racer or a beginer. Because, I am the one that rocks at most racing games that I own I just bought Gran Turismo 2 recently and it is very challangeing this wheel is perfect for a game like that!"
3,They Will Do - But Could Be Better,"First, the red seat covers that you receive will not be rosy red like they are in the picture. Mine are definitely red, but I bought these because they looked like they would match the fire engine red color of my Jeep Wrangler. They do not.The seat covers fit well over my standard Jeep seats. One day, the stitching will come undone as it is only single-stitched.But, hey, I knew they were cheap seat covers when I bought them. They will do the job I expect of them."
4,Love this album,I love this album and hope to get more of their music in the future. The music is compelling and motivational at times as well.
4,I only thought I felt guilty for doing too much,"I was immediately swept into the book based on the fact that Kate was up in the wee hours trying to make bakery bought goodies look homemade. (As a Southern woman, I am more likely to be found dusting paprika onto the deli-bought potato salad, but the similarities were there.) I found that Allison Pearson could reach into the deepest fears I have as a working mother and do it with humor and understanding.I found myself often chuckling and reading passages to my husband. He also chuckled.This book is being purchased for women on my Christmas list.I loved it--and look forward to an agent provacateur bra this holiday season."
3,Much better than Nanny Diaries,"I listened to both on tape. However I found Nanny Diaries to be very sad, not funny at all. This one was funny, sure she panned other women in the work force, but some of them deserved to see themselves as others saw them. She did a fantastic job of showing how to try to juggle and not have it all work out. I think many a working mother may just decide it isn't all worth it after all."
4,Refreshingly honest,"This book is on the reading list of every working mother I know. How will they find the time to read it?Kate Reddy is a hedge fund manager with a husband, a fixer-upper townhouse and two children. She also has a surly nanny, a judgemental mother-in-law, some great friends and her very own philosopher/cab-driver. There's also a poetic and handsome American client. The novel deals with Kate's efforts to balance her responsibilities to her job, her kids and her marriage. It perfectly captures the juggling act required of most working mothers. I chuckled and gasped many time in recognition. This is the ideal summer read - fast-paced, funny and honest.My one criticism is that the novel presents only two options for Kate through most of the book - high-stress job with lots of travel or no job at all. Most working mothers fall somewhere in between."
2,Last time I read a book recommended by Oprah,"I respect and enjoy Oprah but I continually am disappointed in her book picks. I guess we are on different pages so to speak as far as literature is concerned.The woman in this story does try to have it all with Marriage, kids and work but her choices obviously are tearing her apart and then the introduction of infidelity disappoints and ruins the hope the book would end well. I know it's just a story so I'll just say ""bad choice"". It drug for pages and finally stops, but doesn't end. Wish I had my 20 something dollars back.I really don't recommend this one. Sorry Oprah."
2,"Journal, List type books - Guess they aren't for me!","I am taking a sigh of relief and saying ""i'm finally done!"". The book started off pretty good... But after a while it got a bit repetitive and mostly boring. I did have a couple times I did smile but it wasn't enough to turn the book around. I'm not even sure I liked Kate. I think it could have been a shorter book and not so much ""blahness"". Most of the time it felt like it was reading like a list. I dont like reading lists for books. This wasn't my cup of tea!"
1,Offensive,"As a working mother, I find this book terribly offensive. It is NOT a light-hearted tale of the trials and tribulations we all face, but a devious, insulting insinuation that it is, in fact, impossible to be both a good mother and a successful career woman.Don't waste your time."
5,A Must Read,"I Don't Know How She Does it is full of insight and wisdom. AND it's a funny, smart and compelling read. You've got to read this book! Julia at girlwise.com"
2,not reality,"I had heard wonderful things about this book. I had heard that it was the 'grown-up Bridget Jones', which initially turned me off. I decided to try it from my local library on a boring weekend. The inital review of Bridget Jones isn't too far off.It was amusing at first, but quickly became predictable. .... The moral of this story is 'if one is a working mum, one is a bad mum'. It has funny moments, but I think that, in reality, the story would have worked out much differently.I am a woman working in a man's world as well. I handle myself very professionally without resorting to her tactics and certainly without meekly accepting the sexual harassment. I am divorced and love it. I am not Kate Reddy and I don't want to be. Women, do not let your daughters read this book or Bridget Jones!"
2,Unrealistic,"I was initially excited to read this book. I am a working mother who is married to an Englishman and loves English books. I am not a violent person but, after a few chapters, I wanted to smack Kate and tell her to grow up. If I were her husband, I would have left long ago AND taken the children with me. She is obviously self-centered and career obsessed. I never once got the feeling that she enjoyed being a mother. Then we are supposed to believe she just gives it all up (not until after pulling a juvenile stunt at the office) and is ""Mary Poppins"" all of the sudden? There were a few incidents that made me laugh or cry but overall the rest did not make up for them."
3,Good enough to read.......,"I kind of liked this book. I didn't love it - but liked it enough to consider reading another book by this author. I do not have children, but I thought the way she was 'short' with her husband and children was totally believable. I could sooo believe how it was that easy to be absorbed by your mental 'to-do' list - even if less than half of those things you never get around to doing. It took me quite a while to get to the point where I actually WANTED to read on (I am an obsessive reader and would read ANYTHING rather than say.....watch TV - not always a good thing). I especially appreciated the whole Jack storyline....actually, I really appreciated the reality of it, even if it wasn't my favorite read.......it makes sense to me.I would absolutely read another of her books."
1,Waste of time,"How sad that so many of the reviewers feel that this book represents their life. While Kate Reddy likes to talk about how much she loves her kids, she avoids them whenever she can, and is mean to them when she is with them. And she says she loves her job, but you never see that in the book, either. The characters in the book are all very two-dimensional; I didn't care a thing about any of them. As a working mother myself, I have very little time to read. I'm sorry I wasted some of that time on this book."
2,Never evolved,"This is a story of a full-time executive who is also a mom, wife, and martyr. She is busy, rushed, and frantic all the time with a staunch refusal to delegate. That is the entire story, it never changes, and never evolves into any decent character portrayal. This book falls flat."
1,DON'T BUY SYLVANIA 2870LV,This VCR has a 90 day warranty. On day 91 this VCR began destroying tapes. It's was cheaper to buy another one that to try to get it fixed. I now own a Panasonic which was rated best by Consumer Reports for fewest repairs needed.STAY AWAY FROM THE SYLVANIA 2870LV!
5,Galactic Combat,"Wonderful story of battles in space and on distant planets, with love, hate and the hunger of power fueling the plot.Tons of action and good drama. I want more..."
3,Not best design,"This does the trick but is not well made. The part that ""glides"" is not attached to the base in any way. It comes off easily and is difficult to put back on."
3,Katie,"I am a sucker for some nice bass, but these headphones just didn't do it for me. I was impressed by how great the mid and treble was, but that cost me bass. If you're looking for some headphones that have bass THESE ARE NOT FOR YOU."
3,"Good sound, but cord is too long and bulky.","The bass on these is pretty good and they fit comfortably over the ear, but the cord is very thick and long....not easy if you'd want to use these with an iPod or something portable."
3,Descent sound for the price,"I paid upper 70s on sale a couple of months ago. I think it's 10 to 15 less now. They're worth $70 so if they've dropped in price then they're definitely worth it. Sound is good for digital stereo, but won't compare to a surround sound headphone. If all you need is stereo you won't be disappointed."
5,Great headphones,"Im a drummer and harmonic singer and for what I need to hear when recording and for just playing music on my computer, these are perfectly crisp and feel good on my head."
5,Great,Its a decent headphone for the priceAmazing soundFor indoor use is perfect but for outdoor like using with iPod not to good the cable is to long and curly
5,Very good beginner headphones,This is my first pair of real headphones and I love them a lot. I was going to get the Grado SR-60i but I read they have very bad sound leaking and that turned me off. These have little to no sound leaking.
4,Great set of headphones,I've owned the MDR-V6 since 09 and the sound quality is still as awesome as the day I bought them. My only gripes would be is that the pads came unattached about a year ago and now I have to keeping putting them back on which is kind of a nuisance. Also sometimes I have to twist the input jack to make the right ear work.
4,Nice sound and fit,These headphones have a very nice sound and are very comfortable. The cord is a bit short but otherwise they're great.
3,Where is the Bass?,"This is great headphone for treble lover, its midrange is adequate but the bass is very minimal. I hear sounds that require good speakers to deliver on this headset, the treble is very clear, human voice is beautifully reproduced; on THX movies the imaging is very impressive ... However, there is very little bass in it. It rated as 10 HZ to 30MHZ, I don't know how sony comes up with the low frequency rating, that is lower than most 12'' sub woofer can deliver. I doubt it can go lower than 80 HZ and you have to look for it. This headphone has the characteristic of electrostatic speakers, clear treble and lack of full audio body, it is suitable for light jazz or the like but not much elsewhere."
2,crackle in bass,"First pair I bought got stolen outta my car, somebody smashed my window and took my bag that held it :(Anyway, first pair sounded great.I bought another pair, there was an extremely disappointing crackle in one of the headphones from a low frequency. This made me extremely annoyed/angry/disappointed. I cannot stand bad crap, and I hate to give bad product reviews. But I had to send it back and now I will look for a different company brand, probably for the rest of my life."
4,Sony mdrv6 monitor series headphone,Good product and clear sound. My son really like this product and I will recommend this also to all my friends.
4,An Excellent Pair of Headphones.,"Have no doubt MDR-V6 is one fine piece of acoustic equipment. However, they're tight around the melon and after 4 months of use I had to tighten the screws on the fold-out hinges. But, they sound a-ma-zing, VERY nice. The sound is so clear that as I listen to them at night, there are moments when I instinctively check if they're actually plugged in and I'm not blasting my stereo aloud waking my neighbors. Some reviews say they have no bass - NOT TRUE, NICE BASS. Really, take my word for it, if plugged into a device that provides decent sound these headphones leave little to be desired. Great sound for under a buck!"
2,"Good, but defective within 1 year; bad Sony support","These are very comfortable headphones, and the sound is natural and deep. Construction seems to be of good quality. I enjoy using these when computer gaming and listening to music.Purchased 1/13/07 through Amazon, I started having my ears shocked at the end of December. It was noticed during Unreal Tournament 3. I thought at first it was a sound driver problem, but after checking it on a home stereo, it also caused the shocks, only much less.I hadn't realized it was a year, so when I contacted Sony today (1/14/08) I found I was a day late for paid labor service. Since they don't offer repair of these anymore, it would cost me fifty-eight plus shipping to get another model. Even if it was within a year, it would have been forty -four plus shipping. I paid about seventy.I'll never buy Sony products again with this kind of support."
3,great stereo sound,"Great acoustics & stereo sound. I can hear all the instruments and backgrounds sounds with exellent quality. But, I like headphones with more bass and these don't have enough base for me. They are also very well made."
2,Headache,"These headphones give me a headache. They are so heavy, the top strap places too much pressure on the top of my head. Part of the problem is the voice coil creating downward force. I literally can't wear these headphones for more than 15 minutes."
3,"Disappointingly flat, sterile, lifeless :(","Perhaps my ears have been sullied by 'augmented' headphones in the past, but these particularly 'phones feel flatter and more lifeless than any others. I'm not talking about a lack of thumping bass... that's fine by me. But rather... well, it's hard to describe. No warmth. No resonance. Just sterile.I suppose this'd be fine or perhaps even desireable for studio monitor work, but when I'm trying to enjoy folk tunes, classic jazz, orchestral music... it's just disheartening."
5,Best sounding headphones I've ever owned !,"I bought these headphones after seeing many radio stations on stickam using them. I also saw great reviews for them on youtube.These are the genuine Sony's. There are some fakes going around, so rest assured that the ones sold here on amazon are real.I got these for a great price on Black Friday. Even at the current price, they are a great buy. The sound of these headphones are so much better than all the others I own. Most importantly, the audio levels are higher, so I don't have to crank up the volume as high on my stereo receiver.Only two negatives:1) Even after using them for over 1 month, they are still a bit tight on my head. Maybe it's just me, as I have a large head.2) The adjustment for the cups tend to slip after putting them on and off. No biggie, as they are numbered and can be put right back into the same spot."
5,Great sounding headphones,"The headphones are comfortable and sound great. The cups provide good isolation from outside sounds. I've had great luck with Sony durability and performance, and these headphones rank with the top headphones that I've owned. I've used the headphones for some studio work and just listening to tunes."
5,Worth every note,"I love it when someone writes a really good review and I look forward to receiving the item. If you want to be in your own world and hear music in a whole new way, get these! You will be so glad you did!"
3,"Close, but...","Compelling and beautiful watercolor graphic looks a bit washed out on the stark white t-shirt. Despite this, the printing is very good, and well placed on the shirt. The shirt itself is a lighter fabric than what I prefer, but it is sewn well. Time will tell how well the garment holds up."
1,Melvin should have another serving of paste,"Directors, actors, and all others associated with the film industry make a real effort to be cerebral. It's understandable, as it's a worthy goal. 99.5% of them fail - perhaps it's a lack of education, maybe it's poor upbringing that has reinforced self-absorption, and it could be that the superficiality which makes them such a good fit in Hollywood directly leads to this end. The only redeeming quality of the film is that it exposes human foibles (and this is not a new concept - it's typically an element of every movie). It seems that movies these days fall on either end of two extremes: telling stories of people who unrealistically do the right thing, or blathering of shallow morons who are poor subjects of empathy. This falls into the latter category. I want that hour and a half of my life back for a more worthy endeavor such as playing target practice into a trash can with a staple gun."
5,Great film,"I picked this up from Hollywood video, noticing ""SUNDANCE"" across the cover. It is a very interesting movie. I may not have seen all of the director's other work, as many of the other reviewers, but having picked this off the shelf by chance, I think I am as qualified as any to say that ""Melvin Goes to Dinner"" is an excellent film. It is a thoroughly entertaining, interesting and thought-provoking film about people. Four people end up chatting for hours over wine at a bistro. The viewer does not know their particular relationships to one another, and in the beginning of the movie, little flashes from the characters' lives are thrown in. I thought the beginning was a bit too much information for a viewer, but it sorted out in the end as the characters' lives unfolded to each other and the viewer. It was an excellent movie, I highly recommend it."
3,Gift Basket,"The gift basket is a lot smaller than it appears in the picture. I ordered it for a friend who lost her mother and was disappointedby the size of the gift. The basket itself looked very nice, just very small."
1,No answer key,"The book has no answer key.The ""Gregg Reference Manual 8th Edition"" mentions that another book, the ""Instructor's Guide to the Worksheets for the Gregg Reference Manual,"" contains an answer key to the ""Worksheets on Grammar, Usage, and Style,"" but the ""Instructor's Guide"" is not available on Amazon. Sound confusing? It is!A second set of worksheets, the ""Comprehensive Worksheets,"" also does not include an answer key.Beware! lest you spend your money on these useless worksheet books."
4,Excellent workbook,"I found the worksheets to be very helpful (if you want to brush up your grammar.) I constantly use the Gregg Reference manual to end office disputes or confusion on grammar and style issues. And, since everyone can benefit from a quick course on grammar, found this a very helpful workbook."
3,Good Enough,"The material is very thin, but it is pretty. It's kind of like felt. It wasn't too expensive though so it's about right for the price I paid. I'm having a garden wedding so I just need this aisle runner to keep my dress out of the dirt!"
2,A Huge Disappointment,"Ive been listening to the Charlatans--faithfully--for years. Hence, I was all juiced about this solo album. But it is wildly overproduced, with hackneyed lyrics and generally crappy music. Let's hope Tim got it out of his system and doesn't bring this lack of creativity to the new Charlatans CD. Otherwise, the Charlatans decent will be swift and unpleasant."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,"And, I have seen a ton of movies.I enjoy mainstream and I enjoy camp and I enjoy puzzlers and I enjoy gore.Buckaroo Banzai, Cube, Bloodsucking Freaks, Pi, Dead-Alive, Primer, were all interesting and worthy in their own ways.Until now, I have never felt compelled to spit out a review.This movie was a maddening waste. I have been robbed of 2 hours of my life.This would indeed be a great movie for the health care insurance industry to sponsor, except that it is so excruciatingly, boringly, aggravatingly awful that the underlying message of 'unplug' those who you love will never be delivered.Prior to this evening, the worst movie I had witnessed (and walked out of 20 years or so ago) was TeenWolf.The only dividend paid by this movie was that it has allowed (forced) me to appreciate the movie that was once my most hated."
1,Terrible...,"I don't write reviews because I have better things to waste my time on. However, since I just wasted time by watching this movie, I feel it is my duty to the rest of you people out there to let you know: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! I read the reviews and thought, ""well, I enjoy many movies that a lot of people dislike, so I should be able to enjoy this one too"" Don't fool yourself-----You have been warned!--------"
4,Going to the hospital? Be careful!,"I thought this was a very interesting plot,with a surprise ending. It makes you a little anxious about going in for a normal procedure."
1,ridiculous,i don't usually write reviews but this movie is ridiculous... a total waste of time...sorry but that's just how me and my friends think...
3,average,"On the most basic level this story has potential? the characters were fairly thought out. well except the main character.The brother, family, nurses, I was more interested in the brother and kids than the main character.I was waiting for Brother Frank to appear, if you know what I mean.anyways, the Ending was predictable, but a good start for a first time director"
1,There's a Better Biography!,"In reply to Sara Cox's review of ""Actor by Accident,"" there's a recent biography of Richard Harris, by Michael Feeney Callan, entitled ""Sex, Death, and the Movies: An Intimate Biography of Richard Harris"" (it's brand new, w/pictures). I bought it through Amazon's UK site (don't think it's available here in the US yet). It's a fantastic biography, written mostly in Mr. Harris' own words! Hope this helps!"
4,A jazz fan's review,"I love jazz, and from the first note I heard of Greg Howe's first CD I said to myself, if he'd lose the distortion he could play some interesting stuff. He did, and he does. I couldn't agree less with the reviewer from France above. Greg Howe doesn't sound like Holdsworth, he sounds like Greg Howe. Even the great guitarists repeat themselves -- I can tell Steve Morse a mile away, I can tell Kenny Burrell a mile away, and even Alan Holdsworth can get a bit repetetive. But Greg plays in the pocket, there's an unexpected lilt and groove to his playing and he's the master of inventive riffs. If Greg doesn't have the same ""playing over changes"" fluidity of Holdsworth, he has something equally worthy -- flawless timing and the ability to inject odd time signatures and changes with flaming funk. Extraction was worth waiting for and gets better with repeated listening."
4,Another gem from Greg Howe,"Greg Howe has always occupied a unique place in the Mike Varney shred universe. Though he has the prodigious technique that characterized the guitarists on the Shrapnel label in the late 80's, he has always provided a funkier alternative to the neoclassical blur-a-thons that dominated the instrumental guitar landscape at that time. All of Greg Howe's albums are uniformly excellent. This release is exceptional in that it utilizes the talents of Dennis Chambers and Victor Wooten, two formidable technicians. Extraction runs the gamut from spanish-tinged acoustic workouts (Contigo) to Howe's unique brand of funky shred (the rest of the CD). A pleasant surprise is Howe's rendition of the Tony Williams Lifetime's ""Proto-Cosmos"". While he doesn't really match Holdsworth's brilliance on the original, it is a worthy attempt nevertheless. If you like Howe's other work, you will like this, too. The backing musicians are a step up over his other releases."
4,Cute Basic Cat Cartoon Book,"This is a great bare-bones book on how to draw cartoon cats in all kinds of interesting poses. I love it. One caveat: the actual content is basically identical to the book, Kids Draw Cartoon Cats, Kittens, Lions and Tigers.Kids Draw Cats, Kittens, Lions and Tigers (Kids Draw)I ordered both, thinking they would be different. They are not.Either book should give you some fun, however. I could wish that the book was longer with more pictures, but that is nitpicking."
1,I am currently online looking for a new mouse pad...,Although the gel wrist rest on this mouse pad works great the rest of the pad sucks. I don't have enough room on the mouse pad to move my mouse around. When I run out of space the white plastic frame around the actual pad makes my mouse stick. I have only had this product for 2 days and I am already shopping for something new.
4,Saved my wrist!,"I've been using this mouse pad for nearly a year and have no major problems with it, except for one ambiguous issue where myLogitech VX Revolution Ergonomic Design Cordless 2.4 GHz Wireless Laser Mouse for Notebooks/Laptops/PCs with Hyper-Fast Scrollingsometimes loses tracking while gaming. (I can't be sure if its the mouse pad surface or the laser component of the mouse.) I bought this mouse pad for two reasons. One, for its adequate and semi-soft-to-the-touch gel wrist support that could be a bit bigger. I barely notice strain or tension in my wrist if I'm on the computer for a couple hours. Two, I needed a new mouse pad that didn't impart a (plastic) smell on your skin.The tracking pad surface is removable from the base -- so you can clean the junk that collects in the crevices -- and gets stained by any chafing material that's made underneath your mouse. The mouse pad itself is good for small desk spaces."
2,Weak but enlightening to Elric fans!,"Moorcock doesn't live up to expectations in this, his weakest work of the Eternal Champion series. Moorcock attempts to explore the human lack of self confidence in most of these semi-related stories but falls short. I can only speculate as to why. I think one contributing reason is he choses a women to voice her self doubt and a writer needs to write what HE knows.However, Elric fans might be interested in the last chapter (blood and souls for Arioch). To understand the full meaning you need to read Vol. 10 ""The Dancers at the End of Time"" first."
5,A wonderful collection of familiar and unfamiliar carols!,"Many of the carols in this book would be hard to locate anywhere else. A person who misses Christmas music from his/her youth in a foreign nation will be especially pleased to find a source. It would also be useful for anyone trying to learn about Christmas in other lands. Each piece has the original language as well as English lyrics. Included are carols from English (including African American Spirituals), French, German, Scandinavian, Slavic, Italian, Spanish and Latin sources. Most of the piano music is playable by a person with average ability at the piano. I turn back to this book every year at Christmas."
3,Reno 911! season 6,"One of my favorite shows Goes through the Tubes on this Last season sadly,the magic is no longer there,some of the original cast members are still sure,terry also but it's not the same,Funny but not the same."
3,From Population and Development Review,"""The results [of this book] hold substantial interest, for they tell us not only about men's experiences of childlessness, but also about the great gap between the experiences of 'childfree' men and women. . . . For the social scientist the study provides an eye-opening look at an underexamined subject and suggests a wealth of hypotheses to guide future research.""From Jerry Steinberg, Founder of the non-profit social club NO KIDDING! ""There is something in this book that every man can relate to, and every man should read it--with or without his partner."""
5,kataklysm kills,Great dvd FULL of live footage and their history. They did a quality job with this. Money well spent. This is one of the best death metal bands going today.
1,Just plain STUPID...,"Anyone with the smarts that Pierce had in this book would not have been that stupid to sacrifice ...""chasing the dime"" for a waste of his ""time""..I could only hang in there till ch 25.. story moves quickly its just void of any real substance.. I like Connelly but this is TRASH..It does amaze me how some can rave about tribal.."
3,Maybbetter not caught,"Not the usual tight story line and involvement with the characters. I never liked anyone in this rather implausable tale. No one really caught my interest. Seemed like it was just stuck in Connelly's computer somewhere and got used a a quick payday. Not up to snuff, no pun intended, with the Bosch series. A rather boring internet sketch that never really gets off the ground. Even the supposed action ending left me in the dark and in the dark."
2,Underwhelming!,"I have enjoyed all of Michael Connelly's books up to now. What was he thinking! Although it certainly is the author's prerogative to change characters and genre on us, it is very disappointing to get a read like this from Mr. Connelly. The character of Henry Pierce is totally unbelivable and entirely unsympathetic. How could someone so brilliant be so dumb each step of the way other than the last 20 pages. One can't expect one's imagination to run that rampant. I'll certainly give Mr. Connelly another chance - but his margin of error is greatly reduced."
1,A real disappointment. Awful!,"I've liked Connelly in the past. He's the closest we can get these days to the likes of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, or Ross Macdonald. The Bosch series is decent. This book is the worst Connelly I have read by far. The negative reviewers have about covered it. If this was your first Connelly, and you said ""never again"", try a Harry Bosch. They're a lot better."
3,Easy Read but I like Harry Bosch Better,"This is the third book by Michael Connolly that I read . The first two were Harry Bosch mysteries. This book is not. Chasing the Dime is an easy and entertaining book to read. I didn't make any connection to the protagonist in this novel like I had in the Harry Bosch novels but that's okay. This is a fast pacedstory.This is a book to read during a weekend, on an air plane,or at the beach. Enjoy it!"
3,Phone call leads to...,"Henry Pierce at first seems quite silly, as he gets drawn into another person's drama all because he gets a phone number that belonged to a woman who was an escort. Why are all these people calling? What happened to her? Is Henry THAT curious? Caring? Empathetic? You wonder why he's letting himself get drawn deeper and deeper and into more dangerous territory. An interesting story entwined with computer molecular technology. No kidding!"
2,I am dissapointed,I am a Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller Fan. Reading Chasing the dime turned me off on the main Character. I just could not identify with the guy. The writing is superb and Mr Connelly does a good job describing the main character but his strange behavior and lack of good sense turned me off.
4,Far better than average genre fair...,"I read this book after finishing Grisham's Summons (not exactly the same genre, but close) and Lehane's extraordinary Mystic River. This far exceeds Grisham and falls in behind Lehane's novel. As many novels in this genre, it requires a willing suspension of disbelief. The end is a bit too hollywood perhaps and the case comes together in a way that fits all too well. However, I did not figure out until the character did. It was an intriguing mystery and the science was fascinating. Connelly is good writer and I will certainly read more of his non-Harry Bosch novels (to take nothing away from his Harry books, I just haven't the time to start the series now). This is far better than most of the genre stuff that sells. Kudos to Mr. Connelly."
2,Not a huge payoff,"This book, while well-written, had some plot problems with which I was unsatisfied by the end of the book. I didn't think the main character's secret about his sibling was as shocking as the build-up indicated, and I couldn't believe the villian's motivations against the protagonist at the end of the book. It just rang false to me--if a villain is just a plain ol' psychopath, that's one thing, but here the villain has a rationalization for [pulling] over the protagonist that just didn't gel."
2,Chasing the Dumb,"All of his other books are 4 or 5 stars but this is the one you can skip. Weak premise, poor pacing, and sloppy plot. Reads like something he wrote before he got famous, then brushed up to cash in."
4,Gripping,"Michael Connolly's Chasing the Dime is a gripping, absolutely readable thriller, that, while not perfect, will keep you reading and keep you guessing. Henry Pierce moves to a new apartment and gets a new phone number that apparently belonged to that of a high priced call girl. Harry's efforts to clear up the phone number problem lead to bigger and bigger problems for him. Ultimately when this woman turns up murdered and Harry is a prime suspect. The ending is a bit predictable, but, in a novel like this one, that's OK. Chasing the Dime will keep your interest and keep you reading. Connolly has a terrific talent in giving us flowing, readable prose. Enjoy."
1,Total waste of time,"It's difficult to fathom how Connelly's editor(s) let this one pass. It's a totally ridiculous and formulaic book. All I can say is that after reading this drivel, 'Void Moon' doesn't seem so stupid after all.While it may be nice to write a novel without your most famous character, then do it without referring to him or the other novels. If Connelly wasn't writing a Bosch book, then why the inclusion of Janis Langwiser as a character, much less one who refers to Bosch in this novel? That crap didn't float when Patricia Cornwell did it, and it's no less silly here.There must have been some contractual obligation to get a book published at the time this came out, because there's certainly no redeeming value to the reader for this one."
2,Pass on this one - stick with the Harry Bosch series,"After thoroughly enjoying all of Connelly's other books, I decided to give Chasing the Dime a try. Big mistake! The main character is just so unbelievable that I found this book very disappointing. The story line just doesn't make sense because the main character is supposed to be a very smart, experienced scientist. I'm not sure who would be so stupid to get dragged into this plot, but scientist Pierce wouldn't even have considered it! And then when you see who the ""bad guy"" is and why he did what he did, well give me a break! Connelly has certainly tried to weave intrigue and mystery into this story but it just falls flat. So stick with the Harry Bosch series where people actually act like, well, real people..."
2,Very disappointing..............,"Like many others, I was very disappointed with this book--to the point of quitting halfway through. I have read and enjoyed all of Mr. Connelly's previous novels, but I just could not get through this. The main character, Pierce, is irritating, annoying in his ineptness, and just plain not someone you care about at all. The plot is far-fetched and unbelievable. I certainly hope the author's next book is better."
2,Frustrating,"This was the most frustrating read. The main character, Henry Pierce, is supposed to be a brilliant scientist, head of his own high-tech company, but he makes the most unthinking decisions and takes the dumbest actions. Where was his brain? Every five minutes I wanted to through this book across the room and shout, ""You idiot! Don't you see what you're doing?"" Totally unbelievable actions and a motivation that even when explained is a stretch. Of course, this total stupidity is what lands him in the mess that it takes his brilliant mind to get him out of. What's really frustrating is the book is still a page-turner. Not, however, one of Connelly's best efforts."
3,Connelly is my favorite author but this is a weak effort!,"I have read all of his work now and this is my least favorite.It is as if he lost pages 300-450 from his 600 page manuscript. The main character Pierce never is in real jeopardy of losing his life or losing his patented design for a molecular computer gadget thingie. Connelly does NOT develop any of the characters in this book, not Pierce, the helpful hooker, Pierce's defense atty, his hacker friend, his partner, or his head of security. If he did, he could have added much, much more dramatic tension figuring out who dun it. Instead when the end comes and the villian lifts off their mask, all you can think about was these points and how the author never really developed the possible villians or gave the reader a shot to figure it all out. A very hurried ending, he phoned this one in ala Stuart Woods."
3,Doesn't hold up well to shipping,"Amazon has already sent me two broken machines, with parts rattling around inside. I'm giving them one more chance because the machine's gotten such great reviews for the $$$. I just wish they'd pack it better."
2,poor service,"When the Gaggia arrived, a small rubber gasket used in the foaming device was missing. After repeated calls, all unreturned, a month later the gasket arrived. It now makes great foam. The poor rating is for the dismal customer service and parts availability.The foaming wand is also the weakest link. It takes six fairly small parts to make this work and they seem to be next to impossible to get."
2,Not what I hoped for,"Thought this would be a step up from my old Krups Gusto. Instead it's been a big disappointment mostly because it does not make as good crema as the Krups did. If I use the optional ""Perfect Crema"" device, it does make beautiful crema but takes well over a minute and sputters liquid and froth making a big mess. Other reviews have indicated the same problem and perhaps a need to enlarge the pinhole."
1,Don't waste your money,"Like crema? Then this machine is not for you. Fine grind, coarse grind; firmly or loosely packed; dark, medium, light-roasted beans; Starbuck's, Peet's, you-name-it brand; small, medium, large dollop of coffee; 15, 20, 25 or 30 second brew time. Follow the CD guidelnes to the letter, doesn't matter. Mechanically my unit seems to operate well, but I've yet to brew a shot, single or double, with any crema. Espresso taste? Forget it. A bitter disappointment. Pass on this one."
5,Love the machine,I am new to making espresso but I was able to make excellent lattes. No more running to sbucks for latte.
1,Not worth the money!,"I purchased this machine approximately two years ago and just had my husband carry it off to his office where there are repairmen present. However, I don't want it back. If someone can fix it, he is welcome to it. The pump failed, the steam spout dripped, and it never frothed properly. It was my first pump machine. I orginally had a Mr. Coffee followed by a Krups (both better than this one), and I thought it was time to upgrade. I'm looking again now but won't look at Gaggia again. I will, however, try another pump machine."
1,I returned it!!!,"When I first opened the packaging, I noticed right away how LARGE and PLASTIC the machine looked. Then I used it and found it not as good as the old $99.95 Krups I've had for years. Returned it choosing reason as ""not up to expectations,"""
1,"IF YOU READ ANY REVIEWS, PLEASE READ THIS ONE","DO NOT BUT FROM SCEPTRE...I have purchased three of these 30 inch flat panel LCD TV's and all three have a ghosting image that is now very visable. This happened with in 10 month's time. When I tried to return the first two that went, Sceptre told me they would not exchange them and there is nothing can do. This was after several weeks of talking to them and I had to ship them back to their office at my expense. I have been dealing with different brands of audio/visual equipment for years and what I thought would be a good buy turned out to be $3,000 wasted. I looked at all the reviews at the time and many people gave them a good review. I am here to tell you that before you buy, please take one more look around. This maybe a good price, but the quality and customer service is not what it should be. This is from someone who bought three of them and they all went bad."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV !!!!!!!!!!!!!,Like other reviewer the picture went out after 2 years. Called manufacturer and said cost would be $250 to fix...!!!! I'd never buy another tv from Sceptre again. The TV is also not univeral remote compatible.
3,Fun but loud,"My five year old enjoys this toy, but it is loud. It stopped going backwards after a few days use."
1,Read the entire ad don't relie on the picture,"This product is not entirely as shown on the picture and as advertised. It is actually the chains and links to the play set and not the greatest quality at that. You definitely are not getting the POWERHOUSE XP you are looking at on the picture just some of the hardware. The lumber and slide are NOT included, YOU must BUY that SEPARATELY.So if you feel that the price is okay for the hardware and you were just looking for the chains and links then this product is for you. I was under the impression that they were selling the ""POWERHOUSE XP"" Play Set as depicted and advertised so I was very disappointed with my little box they delivered. Good news is that I refused to accept the delivery and the company promptly refunded my entire purchase including shipping.So BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,Read the fine print,I saw the price of this and knew something wasn't right. I then looked at the reviews and knew my suspicions were dead on! I was always told if it sounds too good to be true....it must be! Thankful I read before I bought!
1,Good & bad!,"This is SCSI RW drive. Will burn 650M in less than 10 min. Great for servers with SCSI drives to daisy chain.Bought this drive. Worked for 3 months. It was great for first 3 months. Broke on the 4th month. Contacted Yamaha. After numourous run around, gave me non-working number for RMA #. When it works, it's great. Their service/support people suck! Once it breaks, you're on your own. But if it doesn't break, you're blessed with fortune.Just my experience, your mileage may vary."
2,SLOW CD-Rw Drive,"This drive was exceptionaly slow, it also had poor re-write quality, and was a hassle to install."
4,The Good Stuff,This is one very good soul album. Anna King can bring it. Love her voice and love the arrangements. Classic soul. Buy it.
5,Great for the price,"i replaced a broken X0 with this X9 and saved over $100. it works like a charm, doesn't skip or ghost-shifts. i've owned another X9 for several years and have never had a problem. the 1-1 shifting is better, imo, than the 2-1 of shimano derailleus. i shopped around for best prices and amazon, as usual, won with no shipping!"
5,I never get tired of this cd!,Leslie West is my type of blues player. I've listened to this cd over and over for years. I'm always amazed by Leslie West's blues sensibilities.He hits the right notes without fail.I have been a blues fan for many decades - and West is one of the very best!
2,Fade-outs detract,"Leslie West continues to release gutsy albums. This is no exception. My only gripe, along with the recently released Johnny Winter CD, is why have fade-outs? There is plenty of room on a cd to have powerful endings!"
5,Great Jacket,"Great jacket, its warm and it is top of the line in my book, if you are looking for a jacket for the winter months this is the jacket for you!!!"
5,Slightly Bigger But Still Amazing,The jacket was slightly bigger than I had thought it would be but still amazing. My husband layers up a hoodie under it and says he stays very warm. i would indeed buy this jacket again and intend on buying agin with the tax refund as I am a little jealous.
5,can't beat,"super jacket the tall size was the ticket, you can't beat carhartt quality, carhartt products last, this is just another of my collection of carhartt stuff, iv'e got quite a few items from carhartt, several jackets,several coveralls, the fully lined carhartt coverall i use for ice fishing. they have held up well over the years. but most recent purchase was the quilted duck active jacket by carhartt, very satisfied with this product, i am 6' plus so i elected to get the tall, sleeve length an tail length ideal. would recommend to any one doing outside activities in cold weather to check this carhartt product out, i don't think you will be dis-satisfied........ happy trail's"
1,Poor,"""Livestock"" is one killer live album . This one is a disappointment . The songs are rushed . The sound quality is not great . There's no audience ... there's a MISSING mood of excitement . Recorded for 'one off' FM radion transmission , this set doesn't bear 'CD' inspection . Certainly , the very LAST Brand X CD to purchase . Instead , start with 'Masques' and move to 'Livestock ' ."
5,Informative with Artistic Quality,"This book is terrific. The content is full of detail-- lots of project with easy-to-follow instructions. The pictures are so inspiring and are really ""the"" pieces of art. It is worthwhile reading even on the day you're not in the mood of doing any craft."
1,IMPORTANT!!!!!,"When I got the Box, I opened it up and discovered Cd's all mixed up and out of their little holding slits. the packaging was so cheap that during shipping the cd's were severly scratched by the other CD's! So much that none of the games will work.DO Not Buy!!!"
5,Funny series,We had an initial problem with the last disk of this series and Amazon was quick to send a replacement.
2,A Disappointing Read,"I just finished this book. As usual, with Elizabeth Berg's books, I couldn't put it down. But it wasn't my favorite, and I wouldn't recommend it for someone new to Elizabeth Berg. In the Author's Note Berg explained how the idea for this story came to her from a reader's letter of what happened to her and her mother. Berg said she didn't want to have someone else's idea for a story limit her, but I wonder if that happened. Because she was writing with an idea already in her head, did that limit her usual style? As Diana wrote the second letter to Elvis, I knew the ending and wondered if she would really give up on a story so easily. That made the story seem like a fairy tale with a ""happily ever after"" ending. I still love Elizabeth Berg and everything she writes-- there's great stuff in every book-- but I wouldn't recommend this one, especially to people who haven't read her before."
3,civil rights and Elvis,"I did not enjoy this as much as I did Elizabeth Berg's earlier book, The Art of Mending. The author's note at the beginning explains that the book was inspired by a true story, and that put me off. I would have preferred this information to have been presented as an acknowledgment at the end. The story takes place in Tupelo in the 60's, and the discrimination and hardships that a woman paralyzed from polio experiences are told side-by-side with the civil rights struggles of the era. The woman's daughter, who was born while the mother was in an iron lung, tells the story from her fourteen-year-old point of view. The standout character, however, is Peacie, the no-nonsense African-American caregiver, who performs some of the motherly duties that the disabled mother is unable to. The Tupelo setting also foreshadows an Elvis intervention that makes for a tidy but unlikely ending."
4,extremely well done!,"Wow - this book is just too sad. Not that I dislike sad books because there are many that are so beautifully tragic, but this story was so hard to endure because it was very dark and depressing. I felt so badly for the characters, especially knowing that they were loosely based on true people. Still, anytime I read an Elizabeth Berg book, I marvel at how very well-written they are, and this one is no exception. Attention to detail is inpeccible, as always, and the characters are drawn so well that the reader feels as though they are friends/neighbors."
2,Not very smooth...,"I bought this after having a Panasonic Cq-Vd7003U that I paid $800+ for. I paid only $340 for this unit and I got what I paid for. Nothing really works consistently or smoothly. When you play a DVD and are on the menu there is no way to hit ENTER! Also, the touchscreen doesn't seem to work on half of the DVD's I try and play. Odd. All I am saying is save up your money and get the better name brand product. It's worth the wait."
3,Powerful Vocals,"1998's Ignition was the debut solo release from former Yngwie Malmsteen vocalist Mark Boals. Stepping away from the neoclassical metal style, Ignition is a straightforward melodic hard rock album. Boals is undeniably a dynamic vocalist, and hits some seriously high notes on this album. For the most part, that vocal style works pretty well, though there are moments (like the album opener Jane) that make you wonder if he has his um, unmentionables caught in a vise.Ignition isn't quite as focused and impressive as Boals's later albums, but it's still a good first effort and is overall a decent melodic hard rock album. Malmsteen fans may be disappointed at the lack of guitar heroics, but it should appeal to fans of Boals's powerful (if extremely high) vocal style."
5,The Best of Them Yet!,"This Journeyman Project game is the best yet. However, this may be due to the fact that we have made extreme advancements in technology.A 360-degree view let's you pan aorund your entire world. The scenery of past civilizations really is quite beutiful. Presto Studios did a wonderful job on the 3D portion of this game. This game allows the player to interact with other characters in the game. It allows you to choose from a choice of things to say. The extensive inventory allows you to carry several items at once from multiple time zones. The chameleon suit (added bonus!) allows the player to deiguise himself/herself as any character it meets. All of the guises are conviniently located at the bottom of the screen. This truly is a wonderful game!"
4,Good Phone,"I got the phone for Make 25$ & its worth buying. Though there are few cons about this phone, it is worth buying. I would definitely suggest it to others for the price it is offered for. Great Deal.Pros:Like everyone mentioned...Cons:Battery Life is not that goodNetwork Signal reception is not that goodBut, overall its worth buying..."
3,I NEED HELP!!!!,hello my name is shelsee and ive had dis fone for lyk bout 9 months and still have sum questions bout it so if anyone who has A LOT of experience can u plz contact my aim is PORKY7545 thank u it will mean so much
1,Returned,"This phone dropped LITERALLY every call I made. I had to call 611 at least a dozen times during the 4 days that I owned this phone.The organizer and contact features are years behind in usability compared to SonyEricsson or Nokia. This phone might be ""pretty"", and small - but for the advanced phone user - you're going to be very disappointed.I couldn't have returned the phone soon enough."
5,awesome phone!,It's a grrreat phone guys! Clear bright screen. It's sooo easy to navigate. Expensive material. It's a beauty!
2,Looks awsome does not deliver..,"First when the T809 came out for t-mobile I was impressed by it's slimness and vibrant screen. First off the battery is HORRIBLE. You have to charge it every day and if you are using a blutooth headset, you have to charge it every two hours. Now listen to this. I slid the phone up and started dialing, and the screen broke. I was extremely disappointed because for the amount of money i spent on the phone I did not expect the screen to break. I made the made the mistake of calling t-mobile which were very rude and said that since the screen cracks it is physical damage. Thank god the phone was under the manufacturer warranty samsung realized the problem with this model and I sent it in a couple days ago. I would not consider this phone to anyone all it is, is a huge headache that you have to recharge."
2,Not Very Good,"If you are a true Boz Scaggs Fan of the rock music done in the past and the great jazz intermingled in all his records. This one is not for you, It is completely different from any other record he has done and is not worth buying. Unless you insist you need every CD that is available. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,not even close,"Not even close to ""Come on Home"" or ""Silk Degrees"" a few good cuts, but the rest is ok."
2,airport reader . . .,"> Positives: nice glimpses of buddhism in different countries, well researched, taps into the desires to better understand the ""big questions"", held attention during a long plane ride> Negatives: rarely goes into depth regarding the many strains of buddhism described, doesn't seem to leave reader with much at the end> Big annoyance: 50+ year old white author's views on Asian women.e.g. ""I was becoming enamored with the beauty, charm, and mercurial quality of Chinese woman."" . . .the same later happens with a Vietnamese woman. . . these parts were not needed and definitely turned me off (or would've rated book a bit higher).For a buddhism related book, would recommendHappiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill"
4,Hercules: The Legendary Novels,"I Just finished reading the first two books based on Hercules and Xena. BY THE SWORD by Timothy Boggs was the better of the two.The humor level was very close to the show and the dialog could have been lifted straight from a script. But hey, that's what we expect from Boggs. I do enjoy all of the little things that are wrong in the series (especially the snachronisms both intentional and unintentional). In this one Hephaestos is about to blow his stack and cause a volcano. That's what Hercules calls it. Pity the volcano was named after Vulcan (the later Roman god) and not Hephaestos (the Greek god).If you have enjoyed the show and its particular brand of humor and action, you will find this volume to be full of it."
5,A warrior from history battles an alien menace and his past.,"Make no mistake, Liege-Killer is a very strange novel. The name gives little indication to just how bizarre it is, but it's an excellent insight into a new alien race (which consists of two beings who are similar to siamese twins, but can merge at any time) that has a few surprises of its own. Enter our hero, a cryogenically frozen man out for vengeance (the Paratwa killed his wife), and a dwarf. Their specialty: to kill the unkillable Paratwa. This book has a pounding rhthym that matches its hero's mantra: I move, I am, I want, I take, I see, I learn, I grow, I make. The story ultimately ends in a bitter victory that makes you thirst for more."
2,This Printer Is Hungry!!,"I haven't used this printer for photos yet, just correspondence, but so far I have encountered one (for me) serious problem: this printer ""eats"" 2 out of every 3 envelopes I try to print, mangling them and causing a jam. Moreover, the entry for clearing jams is through the back of the printer, which is very inconvenient and time-consuming. Finding a human being to speak to at HP is virtually impossible."
2,Head Coach,"After having other HP printers, I was ready to invest in what Ithough was an upgraded printer capable of photo-like quality. I wouldlove to tell you how the quality is excellent and how glad I am I purchased this printer. However, after 2 days and many attempts to get HP customer service to help [poor service] still no luck. Now I see from this this site others are having the same problem installing it. DON'T buy this printer unless you have access to a pro to assist you. DON'T count on HPSC. I'm back to using the old printer, at least it can be installed! END"
2,"Good Hardware, Poor Software","I purchased this printer with hopes of doing some in-house marketing. 4 Hours later I still could not get the print drivers to work properly in MS Word or MS Publisher. Tech Support lead me in several directions, but no solutions. I had to return the product. I don't think HP does adequate testing of their products prior to release. This is the second time its happened to me and I am staying away from their stuff."
2,Not Too Hot......,"I'm a long-time Bossa lover. The song line-up looks interesting, but the approach to these classic tunes is lack-luster. The drummer seemed like he could not decide to play Bossa style or samba. The electric bass sounds cheesey. This is not Bonfa, B. Powell, C. Byrd, Almeida......"
3,"better than ""Tonight""","I got my first piece to Silk back in high school so I was stoked for the new album, after a 3rd listen or so i was feelin most of the songs, i think they need to start hookin' up with some other producers though. Lil' G's mad skills carry the album as usaul, that fool could sing the drawers off a deaf women."
5,Still' Keepin' it Hot!,"This being Silk's third Cd, They are still keepin' it hot. This Cd comes with a variety, from getting you to your love sessions, keeping you with your love sessions, apologizing to your love, and then getting the Afterplay with your love. Everybody out there if your reading this review, go ahead and get the Cd, because you won't be sorry. Some suggested tracks are: Welcome 2 The Love Session, Were Callin you, Nursery Rhymes, Ebony Eyes, Ahh, Afterplay. - Now don't wait,sleep,or procrastinate get the Cd."
2,Boring,the song We're calling you was the best song on this cd. This cd was not good at all. I will not buy this cd if you haven't.
5,teacher to be,"Peggy's recent article in Discover magazine about women inscience and technology prompted me to re-read schoolgirls after7 years. It is crucial reading for me as I am leaving thetechnology sector to teach math, and I am raising 2 daughters.I see so much of myself in both the article and this book, I'mscared to read her most recent book ""Flux..."". Upon re-reading""Schoolgirls"", however, it seems clear to me that it is not teachers who are inflicting the gender stereotypes - kids learnthis at home and kids in turn teach it at school. If teachers can avoid being pulled in and reinforcing the behaviors, we are in a unique position to challenge them and break the patterns.Parents and teachers alike must teach our daughters to respectthemselves, AND we must teach our sons to respect girls andvalue their contributions.I too would very much love to know what has happened to thegirls in this book."
4,"Superb, an eye opener","I'm a middle school teacher, and this book really opened my eyes to the classroom dynamics that hold so many girls back."
4,incredible beauty and angst - in an easy-to-take package!,"For those who can't yet stomach a full-length CD of fierce, quaking Tiny Tim - like vibrato (like me), this CD EP is the answer. (Blame it on my musician's ears, I guess.) But this CD is a true gem! Out of all BE's CDs, this is the one whose songs really speak to me most poignantly, and has the production and instrumentation I prefer. Most significantly, ""A Perfect Sonnet"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my 40 years of life on this earth. Flawed and beautiful, that's what these songs are. A flawed and beautiful masterpiece."
4,Every Whatever,"Although I like this album, there's nothing that especially stands out about it. It's typical Bright Eyes, and if you already love the band you won't be disappointed. However, it's not one of their best albums. It's not as good as Lifted, not as addicting as Fevers and Mirrors, and not as raw and endearing as Letting off the Happiness. But yet again, Conor succeeds in writing songs that capture all of the emotion without making me ill in a Dashboard Confessional sort of way."
2,bummed,for buying a cd that was $10 i expected to have atleast 10 songs on it. there were only 5:( plus its generally just not their best album. i only liked 2 songs! bright eyes you better shape up!
1,poor sound,"As I sit here listening to this CD, I am brought back to the days when I used an old cassette tape recorder to make recordings of my band from the front row of a club...TERRIBLE fidelity. There is no quibble with the musicianship, but this CD is almost unlistenable on a decent stereo system (and mine is more than very good). It sounds like a bootleg recording done with inferior equipment. Be aware, if you order this item...only if you are a Bobby Hutcherson ""completist"", can I recommend it."
3,Sound problems,"Beautiful picture, but recently a humming noise in the background has made it difficult to enjoy the HD-TV experience. Samsung will send a technician to look at the problem."
5,Great Product,"Although we don't have HD reciever for our satellite system yet, the TV itself works beautifully and was well worth the money. The shipping went well too. The TV remote is intutitive and we especially like the fact you can switch between regular picture size and 16:9 for those programs that are transmitted in that format."
4,Quality,The Samsung LNS3251D is a well made quality TV. However if you are looking for that crystal clear picture don't expect it unless you are receiving HDTV and are using the HDMI connection (cable not included). Aside from that I would recommend this TV and would look at Samsung first for my next purchase.
3,Traditional tint is a bit too dark - my mistake,This is OK if you do not mind it darking your screen.It was my mistake as it was described as traditional tint.Fortunately at $10. shipped it was not a great loss.I reordered from anther Amazon vendor that had the Light View that is perfect.
3,Hawaiian music history,This is an autobiography of Harry Owens who wrote the song Sweet Leilani.He was a mainlander who moved to Hawaii in the 1930s and became the music director of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.The song was featured in the film Hawaiian Wedding in 1937 and was sung by Bing Crosby. The song won an Academy Award and was Crosby's first gold record.
1,How to get lost between the object theory and C++,I had bought that book from amazon com along with the amazing book : Building Buisness Applications using C++. The Booch Book is just a Theory during six months i am trying to apply what is written to practical usage unfortunatley it won't do the best of all is the other book at least it teaches something usefull not thoughts from a man setting at another Planet so sorry for wasting my money.
3,No JAVA just for C++ programmers,"If you are a working C++ programmer this may be interesting but I found it ""yeah, what else?"". Most of thoughts are sought of easy & if you were disciplined could come up with the insights yourself. Good for an entry level C++ working programmer though, not for an advanced programmer like myself."
3,Occasionally fun to play,Limited though energetically appealing indie dance sophomore struggles to stand time with pedestrian production but manages a few sly numbers which pointed towards a comfortable career in sub-genre appeasement.
4,Very popular as party favors,"We had an ""ice cream sundae party"" and as party favors, we gave away little plastic bags filled with M&Ms; and one ""Cute brute"". They were very popular, especially with the kids at the party. All of the kids had fun picking their favorite animal. (The polar bear looks like a dog to me, but no one else seemed to think so).These are pretty darn cute and they make good party favors. They'd probably also make good gifts for people who eat a lot of ice cream (or people who love any product in the shape of an animal)."
1,unwatchable,you know your in trouble when the best thing about a DVD is the trailer.you have been warned !
2,He should have stopped at 3 books,"This is the danger of making an endless Series of the same book. 10 titles with some up to the standards he presented in the first 3, but sadly hit and miss in the last 7. I honestly could only read a portion of this one at a time because I thought about what I needed to get done around the house. If a book can't make me forget for a time about trimming the baseboards, then it's failed for me badly. My wife read all, and wasn't far from my opinions, but she wanted no part of the single 11th book? Thank you for the first three, but not many writers can copy the success of Harry Potter, and should not try.."
4,Not the best in the searies (book 6 was) but good.,"This book is ok and with book 9 it makes some decent strides on the 3 book plot. However, there are 2 things that would have made this trilogy better:1. Cover only the past that hasn't been covered in the last book.2. While any one of the books in the series can be read alone, in this 3 book trilogy there is a lack of real completion. As a result, at the end of chainfire and phantom there isn't a satisfactory closing to make it a stand alone book though I suspect that book 3 will provide a full resolution.This brings me to one conclusion. TG should have waited until all 3 books were done before releasing them.That being said, I like where phantom takes the trilogy. It is a good build up for content in the 3rd book. I just hope the 3rd book will not restate what happened in the other 2 books."
3,"PLEASE Mr Goodkind, PLEASE!!!","Could you please return to the style of writing that everyone loved in WFR? It was so entirely engaging.The explanations there, though lengthy had depth and it made sense without being confusing. Your writing has changed into a long monologue of either how magic works or how life is precious and each one has a right to it. Let us rediscover this world anew. Magic has become flat; it used to have a dimension that we could grasp. What is with all the big words? This is not a magic text book. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let us have the style of WFR in this last book!"
3,How Many Tortures Can We Read About??,"Goodkind is a very talented author, I enjoy his books overall, but come on, how many different people do we have to read about who think nothing of heinously torturing helkpless victims? We have Jagang's army, we have the evil sisters, we have that queeen and the witch Six. After awhile, reading repeatedly, in gory details, about rape, castration, mutilation, degredation, etc, becomes very mind numbing. Goodkind seems to have a fascination with this kind of stuff. Just like way back in the series when Richard was tortured endlessly by the Mord Siths. After awhile it gets very tedious and repetetive and sickening."
2,Great Service from Amazon.......hated the book.,Terry Goodkind has exhausted this storyline. How many times do the main characters have to suffer unspeakable agony and be separated to make a point. No spoilers but it would have been nice to have some plot resolution this time.
3,"Phantom: Chainfire Trilogy, Part 2","From the first book in this series, I have been hooked. I love the guts and grim determination that is a main part of The Sword of Truth books. However I have the same problem that I find With Robert Jordans, The Wheel Of Time series. I feel like I'm walking in mud. Both series started off with such direction and clear purpose, but now I find myself mired in, ""in my opinion"", not needed details. There are now so many sub-plots and side isues that I find myself fearing the next book. I know the Mr. Goodkind has a vision and I celebrate that vision, but I wish that he could be a little more brief."
3,Tired of cliff hangers?,"Then don't read this book. The story line dragged at some points, but overall it was good."
2,trailing off to nothing,"Goodkind's first Wizard's books were great, but then he lost his dynamo in 2 major ways: 1) he started pounding the pulpit over his philosophy, a put-me-to-sleep act, and 2) he started padding his books with recaps of prior books. This last book ""Phantom"" had about 200 pages of new stuff and 500 pages of review; in fact, the last 5 books could have made 2 books if all the redundancy had been removed. Like others have said, I skimmed over page after page off recaps and pulpit pounding. Mr. Goodkind started off his series good, but he has really trailed off to nothing. For the last book, ""Confessor"", I'll wait to find the paperback in a used book store someday."
4,It's a giant cliffhanger,"This plot and dialog is as compelling as all of the other books, but do not expect the complex plot to be resolved. I don't know when the Sword of Truth series will end, but it will definitely be in some future book. I'm reporting this because, if you read this book, you likely have read the previous nine. I expected big resolutions of plot issues and they just did not happen. Great cliffhanger at the end, though."
3,Only 1 more book to go!,After 100 pages or so the preaching drops off and the plot picks up speed. The finish line is in sight!
2,bored,"I shouldn't be writing this as I am only halfway through the book, but that is kind of the point, I am halfway through and all the characters have been standing around in the Keep yapping at each other in a repetitive drone that is going nowhere. I keep reading because I paid for the book. I loved the first half of the series but lately nothing seems to happen. I can't remember much from Chainfire, other than a whole lot of stuff that has been re-explained in this book so far. Finish series.....make a movie and be done with it."
3,To Long,"A lot of the text in the book concerns passages which refer to the other books from the series. I feel that a lot of stuff is written to help people who didn't read the other books to understand the relations and what is happening. Still, Í am looking foreward to the last book."
3,You are All right!,"I have read the whole series and have had a ""Love/Hate"" relationship with most of them. Though the last two books, Chainfire & Phantom could have been the same book written twice. There was much more action and adventure in the first 7 books, and now it seems the story is a little to drawn out. I will read the last book, but I can't imagine how Terry will bring all the story lines into one final book. Good Luck."
2,The continuation,"TG in his SFT series has always felt the need to repeat himself hundreds of times so that a full third of the book rehashes the series up to the current point. However up till now the story had continued to advance enough that by the end of whatever book I had read it seemed worth reading. Phantom was a complete disappointment in that it did not. As slow paced as his books are I somehow doubt he'll be able to masterfully end what still stands in my mind as a good series in one final novel. Those who have the time I still would recommend the series, this book one just has to suffer through and in all honesty may not even be that bad if the reader can quickly move to the next one due in Nov 07'."
1,Goodkind must get paid by the word,"I swear, he just goes on and on and on about the most mundane things (4 pages to describe how to leave the keep from the second floor??). He seems strangely fascinated with the rape and the suffering of children.When he gets into full philosophical mode I just skip pages. I know Im not missing out on any crucial plot mover and it is useless to try and ""flesh out"" a character that has been in at least 5 if not all the last 9 books.TG has gone ""Robert Jordan"" on us."
3,Casca's Japanese adventure worth a read,Barry Sadler weaves his timeless hero into one of Japan's most famous battles by having him delivered to the shores of the Rising Sun after a storm. This was well worth reading and there is a fascinating part where a Japanese sword is made. Some of the story skips along a little too fast but the insight to Japanese medieval society is intriguing.
3,Hate to see 'em go out like this,"Man do I love this band, and ""Dig Me Out"" and ""The Hot Rock"" fall firmly in my top 20 albumbs by any artist, but this album is far too inconsistent to recommend. Some GREAT songs, and some that aren't getting better even on the 20th+ listen."
1,Women's Large = Men's Large??,"I ordered one T-shirt for myself and another for one of my male friends. Normally I am a Medium in NA and Large in Europe, so I thought I should be fine with a Large. WRONG! This T-shirt is like a dress and I am 5'8""! It's as big as the male version and I can only wear it at home. They either send me the wrong stuff or their measurements in Honduras are completely wrong. Too bad for the nice picture on it!"
4,Good book- titled wrong?,So I really enjoy this book. There are tips for using props for getting into poses and making poses more comfortable for all types of people. I'm a yoga teacher so any suggestions about helping various populations into postures that work for them is great.But I can't help but disagree with the title- there are certainly tips- and I'm sure that some people would consider them cool. I just really think this books would be better titled as The Joy of Props in Yoga Poses...or Yoga: Props are your Friends.Good book either way- but I bought this book thinking there would be cool moves and transitions to get from crane to headstand or something of that nature.Still a good book- just not what I expected.
4,Great reading about discrimination of that period,"The book caught my attention because (1)I like historical novels,(2) my last name is Mireles but no relation to author and (3)the fact that it's written by a woman. It's amazing how this manuscript remained hidden out of fear of what the ""gringo"" community would do/say mainly because the book addresses what it was like for Mexicans/Mexican Americans of the period and well into the 70s. Being a Chicana this book also told me a lot about how the mujer was treated but inspite of it how brave Jovita was and finally finding the courage to release her manuscript. It proves the courage that toda mujer finds."
4,"Amazing, what some people do.....",This book is definitely for those who like to read about the unusual....I enjoyed this light and entertaining read.
1,House Season 3,"There is something wrong about the disks. I have 3 DVD players and only one of them can play them without getting stuck many, many times. I have many collections of TV series and this is the only one that has this problem."
2,Better Rent It !!,"I own the first three seasons, They are Impeccable in all aspects. Writing, Camera Angles , Funny sarcastic Dialogs, Loved House. But in this Fourth season I don,t know what happened. Its shallow, lacking of depth and as other reviewer said House is a parody of himself. So I suggest you better rent it first before you make the purchase. Hope the season 5 gets better I think it is because the writers strike Its a shame though because of that situation House suffered a cut in its Grandeur first three excellent seasons."
3,"Started off slow, but ended well","Season Four of House, M.D. was a very big shift from any of the first 3 seasons. Gone were the the old, and in were the new. The new team is far less interesting or engaging; rather, they actually take away from the whole diagnostic process. Despite this unfortunate change, House, Wilson, and Cuddy are at their finest as the season started moving on. The two-part season finale was, in my opinion, the best episodes ever produced. This could only be achieved though with more appearences from Chase and Cameron.This season is far shorter than any of the past, so don't expect the same as in the past. The extras are not very strong in this DVD collection. I bought the DVD because I love the show and already have Seasons 1-3, but I would recommend purchasing the first 3 season first if you haven't seen them yet.Not nearly as good as usual, but still worth watching."
1,Doesn't Play on UnBox Viewer,Sorry to say that this episode doesn't play on the UnBox Viewer. I does play on Windows Media Player (with some artifacts).
1,"NOTHING, NADA, ZERO, ZIP!!!!!!!!!!!!","IT IS NOW JULY 15TH 2009 AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE SEASON 1 AND 4 OF HOUSE MD THAT I ORDERED IN JUNE.BETTER YET, I HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE OR REPLY TO EITHER OF MY MESSAGES TO THE SELLER INQUIRING AS TO THE STATUS OF MY ORDER.I CAN UNDERSTAND POOR MAIL SERVICE BUT I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE. THIS IS THE ONLY BAD EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE HAD WITH ANY ORDER I'VE EVER PLACE THROUGH AMAZON. I DON'T PLAN ON LETTING THIS EXPERIENCE OF ""ONE BAD APPLE"" RUINING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH AMAZON, BUT LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY I WILL NOT BE ORDERING AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Totally satisfied,Just as described and beyond. A great way to get great products at an awesome price. Will continue to purchase.
5,House MD,"I have all four seasons, and season four is the best. I wasn't all that into it at first but as the season progresses it gets better and better. The finale is amazing. I totally agree with one of the reviewers, ""Don't start watching this series unless you want to get addicted."" The more you watch it, the more you are addicted."
5,INCREDIBLE!!!,"This whole album is great, but the song, ""My Skin"" may be my favorite song ever. It starts slow and quite and builds to a haunting and wonderful melody with piano and cello, I think. If this song doesnt move you, you are DEAD! Natalie Merchant is one of my favorite artists because she bares her soul and she is extremely talented. Great album!!!"
5,Music From The Soul For The Soul,"A very profound album consisting of beautiful vocals, simple but supportive musical arrangements and piercing, provocative lyrics. If your the type of person who enjoys lyrics/music that pulls at your heartstrings then this is the definitive CD for you. The overall tempo of the CD can be percieved as slow and sombre with the most upbeat song being ""Kind And Generous"" but every song has merit and can easily stand alone. Fav. songs- Frozen Charlotte, Life Is Sweet, My Skin, King Of May, and Ring The Golden Bells. Peris and Davenport's backing vocals complement Natalie's voice beautifully. Well Done Natalie! Looking forward to your next effort. Hey, can you recommend a good shrink? HaHa...."
2,Too much Natalie Worship,"I've been interested in Natalie since 1985, and she sure has a singular voice. I miss the frolicking-on-stage Maniac, compared to the adored pretense of today. When she sings about ""thanking"" everyone, I am not persuaded of her sincerity."
4,An album that is pure Merchant!,"Like the voice,like the album. An aquired taste for those who seeks for pure talent & soul. And who can ignore the poetic writting of Miss Merchant which surpasses the writting ability of Sarah Mclachlan. ""When They Ring the Golden Bells"" was the only song that hinders me to give this album the highest rating she deserves. She should have scraped it from the album."
1,Stop the pain!,I just don't get the Natalie Merchant thing. How many times can she release THE SAME SONG under different titles and get away with it? She needs to get off her high horse and become a librarian or something. Avoid this one like the plague...
2,"Not too Happy-go-lucky, are you Natilie?","I'm basicly a happy, fun, lighthearted type of music person ( with the exeptions of Tears in heaven etc..etc), so when I heard Ophelia, I was a bit depressed. To say the least. Then, after reading what all these other people have to say, I am positive that this is definetly not her best work. I do love the song ""Life is Sweet"", but in Kind and Generouse It seems that the only leric is thank you. That's all. Thank you. (snicker snicker)"
4,music lover,I purchased this item afterr hearing somr of the music on a tv show. I bought the album and i enjoy it.
2,Disappointing.,"Although 10,000 Maniacs is my favorite band, and Natalie's solo Tigerlily is one of the best albums I have ever heard, Ophelia is just plain boring. It seems to me to be a collection of tracks that were never added to Tigerlily for one reason or another. Although the extra instruments used throughout Ophelia does broaden Natalie's application of her unique musical style, it is simply not enough to turn this into something provacative. In a word, it's disappointing."
5,Awesome Earrings!,"These earrings are gorgeous and secure with a nice, snug fit. Securely shipped in a small black gift bag, they are very reasonably priced and and arrive in no time. This item is also included in Amazon's free super-saver shipping, which was a great bonus! But even with the 'combined' free shipping offer, they were still shipped out within a day or two, and in fact, arrived before anything else. I'll be back for more!Large Sterling Silver 2.5"" Endless Hoop Hoops Earrings"
2,Did not look like the picture!,"these are pretty cheaply made. I wouldn't recommend them. I was hoping for a good quality, full 2.5"" hoop but they do not look like the picture at all."
4,VERY VERY CUTE,"I was very excited to find these shoes on sale, i bought them right away and was very happy when i received them, they look very good in real, they're made of excellent quality materials, and look soooo cute on, the fit was excellent for my somewhat wide foot, they were perfect, except for that they rub a little at the ankles, i had to stuff in lining pads to raise my ankles a little to avoid the rubbing, other than that, they're perfect i adore them :-)"
5,This is an excellent soundtrack score,This score is much better than the one put out before. The Truth and Light album that had a lot of extraneous dialog inserted into the music. This is a clean soundtrack with great moody themes.
5,"RIP, Bill and Devereaux","As the first of thirteen books in the November man series, fans were left thirsting for the character of Devereaux, and I must admit I see certain parallels between Hanley and Irene Kennedy, Rita and Anna Reilly, and, of course, Devereaux and Mitch Rapp. Fans of the genre will know what I mean. I searched for years for the next installment, only to learn in Bill Granger's obituary this morning of his deteriorating health over the past many years. I salute you Bill, and the wonderful characters you cultivated for your fans. I extend my condolences to your family, and will forever cherish the day I discovered the November Man."
2,Doesn't provide good enough preparation,"The methods to solve each type of question are not good enough. In each chapter, there is a diagnostic test. When one doesn't score too well on it, it can become demoralizing while studying the rest of the chapter. The only thing I find useful in the Kaplan book are its practice tests.I strongly recommend that you buy the Princeton Review book. It is a very good book and teaches us to solve every type of question in a way that makes it very easy for the student. Without the Princeton book, I would have not gotten my 730 in the actual exam!"
2,Buyer beware!,"Okay, be careful with these. I bought four for the perimeter of my house, and two years later, two of them stopped working (past the warranty, of course!). It's not that the bulbs burned out - in fact, I can hear that the motion seinsors are still working, but something in the light mechanism is kaput, and there's no apparent way to fix these. Great idea, but let's make stuff that holds up, please!"
3,swing set,My son has had a lot of fun using the stairs and the slide. We had to take the swing off when he was just 11 months old because it was too close to the ground. He was never able to actually use the swing because of how close to the ground it was.
3,I love everything but the Swing,My daughter Alexandria loves the slide but when i put her in the swing she was very disappointed because it doesn't swing they should have called it a bouncer.
4,Gets The Job Done,"Does exactly what it's supposed to do and in a compact fashion.The only gripe i have about it is that when you unplug it from your iPod, the iPod keeps playing unlike my old 3.5-to-3.5 which pauses the music when you unplug."
2,most time coffee does not flow,"it is a nice product, not sure how many bars of pressure but most times coffee grind for espresso does not flow. I figured out that a grinding of 2.5 at the coffee shop would do it, but since the coffee shop grinder is most likely +-20% off sometimes does not flow and then i have to buy more coffee (grinded at 3) and mix it up with the previous one to make it thicker"
3,"Volume # 2, Where is it?","I actually bought the soundtrack before seeing the movie, because of the great songs it had. Now it's one of my favorite CD's. After having seen the movie on HBO, I want to know how so many of the great songs in the movie didn't make it. If they made a volume 2 it would sell. And Vol #2 should definetly include ""6 underground"" and ""Mandy"". I hope those who agree will post a review and maybe somebody will listen. ""If you make it... we will buy"" It was a great movie and a good soundtrack, now help us out with Vol 2P.S. Was ""Mandy"" about his dog?"
1,Big Disappointment!!!!,"I just watched this flick on HBO and thought, God this soundtrack kick's ass!!! But actually it sucks. This CD doesn't have 1/2 of the songs I wanted it to have. Can we get a Volume 2 maybe????"
2,Song from the End of the Movie,The song from the end of the movie is called Only You and was by the band Yaz.
3,Another song request,"What is the disco song that is playing when Lauren Amborse, I forget her movie name...you know the girl from Six Feet Under, is sitting on the couch at the party when the kids from school bet on if she was a student or not? Thanx"
4,Does anyone know this song in the movie??,"The movie was fun, but there were so many good songs missing from the cd. That just puts a big hole in the soundtrack.I'm looking for the name of the song which was playing in the movie when Seth Green and the red headed chick kissed in the bathroom for the first time, and then that went on to Jennifer L. Hewitt walking outside and that crazy girl with the yearbook asks her to sign. The song plays for about 10 seconds, and I know that it sounds like a male voice, maybe I'm wrong but I think the song starts out with ""I'd like to..."" and thats all I could hear.Someone PLEASE help!"
5,An all around great soundtrack!,"I can't imagine what I would have done without this fabulous CD! It offers such a diverse variety of great songs and musicians including the incredible artists Third Eye Blind, Smash Mouth, BLink 182, Feeder and much more! This CD contains a wonderful combination of music and has something for everyone. As soon as I listened to this CD, my headphones were permenantly glued to my ears. A great soundtrack to go with a great movie! Party on!"
4,it's about time,"This is a well-done and overdue effort. There are only a few BS&T recordings that have not made the transfer to CD. (I'm still waiting for New City.) This is a little more R&B than many of the band's efforts, but enjoyable nonetheless. I burned my old LP onto CD a few years ago, but this is better. This album didn't do well commercially when it was released, but has stood up well over time. I believe it was their last work for CBS/Columbia."
5,Zen V Charger For The Road Warrior! Great!,This combo charging package is worth the few extra dollar over a standard wall charger if you travel as much as I do. Great design with retractable cord and works in a wall socket or in the car so my Zen V Plus is always charged when I want it.
4,Buy this for Janet Baker,"I adored this Wunderhorn cycle when it first came out in the mid-Sixties and thought it would remain my favorite forever. It hasn't, in part because the orchestra is pretty scrappy, in larger part because there is a LOT of microphone distortion whenever Baker or Geraint Evans hit high notes or sing at loud volume. Wyn Morris conducts well if not spectacularly. I hold on to this CD primarily for Baker's exquisite, intelligent singing--she never recorded these songs again that I know of. When the time came for EMI to record them, her home label chose Schwarzkopf over Baker, a mistake I regret to this day."
3,an OK effort,"If you like Christafari, you will probably prefer the ""Gravity"" album to ""WordSound&Power.;""But I just can't get into Christafari. The problem is NOT Christian reggae as such. Many Christians, both Rasta and non-Rasta, make excellent reggae.No, the problem is that Christafari has put out some catchy pop reggae over the years, but the quality is spotty. Too much Christafari music seems overproduced, lacking true heart and soul. The lyrics that aren't stolen directly from Bob Marley often seem contradictory and don't make sense. The DUB is weak too.Christians will probably find ""WordSound&Power;"" too sectarian. If you're not a premillennialist pentacostal fundamentalist, and especially if you're an orthodox roots Christian, you're inevitably going to be annoyed by Christafari's (really poor) theology. Christafari should have stuck to essentials."
4,Good book - now available online,"Good book, covers many points. One or two aspects are slightly weak, but for those interested in women's issues in The Quran, it is a must-read. Now the book is online, and summaries etc."
3,Not an easy read,"I think this is an amazing book, however it's not the easiest to read. The writing is hard to follow and I couldn't find some of the words she use in the English or Oxford dictionary...still her points were great and the issue was made clear in the end. Very educational."
2,Its a basic overview,"I was disappointed with this book. I feel I could have spent my money more effectively elsewhere. While this is not a bad book by any means, it was just less than what I expected. This book reads more as an overview of Windows 2000 features. There is VERY little how to or instructions. Definitely not an on the job reference book or a certification study guide. I recommend this book as an evaluators guide or as an introduction into what Windows 2000 can do, but the use of this book can be replaced by using the Windows 2000 help system."
4,The X Files,"The high-profile soundtrack to the massively hyped ""The X-Files"" movie was led off by two principal singles- Foo Fighters' ""Walking After You"" and Sting & Aswad's ""Invisible Sun"". Both of the songs are mediocre alternative-pop that are highly unsuitable to the dark atmopshere ""The X-Files"" has always been associated with. Better picks are obviously the darker, more complicated tracks. The Cardigans' swaggering, jilted-love anthem ""Duece"", Bjork's freakish ""Hunter"", and the eerily haunting remix of Sarah McLachlan's ""Black"" stand out on this inconsistent and loosely-tied disc. Those tracks alone are still worth a listen, but the rest of the album, especially Noel Gahllager's pointless instrumental piece, is pure throw-away."
3,"Cool cd, but ... what do we do with non-x tracks?","I don't understand Chris Carter's plans on X Files cd's. It's not that the tracks by Filter, Foo Fighters, Soul Coughing or The Cure are bad, but aren't they way too 'american'? I mean, maybe they are in currency over there, but the european market is different. Some artists are wasted -why Björk hasn't a new track?- and some others are terribly bad -X's version of The Crystal Ship is CRAP! Tonic's Flower Man is very boring. How good the european release -at least the spanish one- has two extra tracks (Mike Oldfield's Tubular X and Lliso's El Futuro), but it still sounds too far.The next X Files cd would be lovely including tracks by U2, Héroes Del Silencio, Pet Shop Boys (would it fit? Sure they can), Björk (this time unreleased tracks), perhaps Fear Factory (yes, they're u.s. but they sound euro), and some like that."
4,A Must Buy For Any X-Phile!,"When I first listened to the CD, I wasn't immeadiatly impressed, but as I listen to it more and more, the tracks grow on me. Most of the tracks are perfect tie-ins to the show. While a couple of the tracks didn't impress me, notably ""One"" and ""Invisible Sun"", I love ""Flower Man"", ""Beacon Light"", ""Black"", and ""More Than This."" Anyone who is a fan of the show should enjoy this CD. It truly captures the spirit of The X-Files!"
4,"Realistic, Sneaky-like, yet difficult","This is a great realistic submarine perspective. When you sit at your computer you feel like a true German sub commander. I always liked games where stealth is involved. I like patience too. If you have patience and if you like difficulty, you will most likely really like this game. I must admit, it is very difficult, and takes some time to finally understand the simple basics of this game. I had to read through the manual a number of times to get everything to where I understood. But when that is all worked out, you will have yourself a blast. I give it 4 stars, the difficulty involved to start out with is its only downfall."
1,"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs and ahistorical.",I have an open mind about naval simulations. This sim is one of the most disappointing sims I've ever played. If you like sims with lots of bugs and don't resemble the history they are supposed to portray than by all means waste your money...
4,"Great espresso, fussy messy machine","I've used this machine for over a year. It takes a day or two to work out it's quirks, but once you do the espresso is top notch. But it is very sensitive to small differences in grind and how you fill and tamp the portafilter. And it is messy. Multiple espressos take a bit of time. If you are willing to deal with these limitations, I don't know of a better machine for the money."
4,Another solid collection by one of the nation's best literary magazines,"The title says it all. Conjunctions is a great magazine and this is a solid issue. The theme, ""secret lives of children,"" is great and we get great work from the likes of Robert Creeley (RIP), Shelley Jackson and Stephane Mallarme."
2,Gojira v.s. Godzilla,"First let me say that I love Godzilla and these films are some of the best . What I am annoyed with is the lack of a subtitles option . Why put these films on DVD and leave out this option ? OK I know that most people grew up and loved the awful dubbing, but for those of us who rate these films as important celluloid history, this omitance is unforgivable !Give Godzilla the same respect accorded to anime such as 'Ghost in the shell' . And while your at it give us the origional Gojira film alongside the Raymond Burr re-hash . Got that....Good .P.s. If anyone knows where I can get this stuff please e-mail me, monkeymagick@hotmail.com"
4,Three Great Songs and the Rest Just So-So,"I bought this CD for three songs -- the title track Tracy, Run Sally Run, and When Julie Comes Around. I was not disappointed. The three tracks never sounded better. The rest of the tracks did not provide any excitement. This is one of those CDs where an unexpected song or two might just grow on you."
3,Pretty good for 3-5 year old.,"I'm a little confused why the previous reviewer thought it wouldn't be appropriate for anyone under 5, my 4 year old finished the game in a morning. The game is more of a storytelling/listening skills game rather than a puzzle/arcade style.The gameplay is different than other thomas games, this is more of an ""adventure"" style game. Granted the ""go and find"" aspect is a little lame, but the occasional puzzles are stimulating enough for this young age group. My only wish is there were more ""chapters"", I don't think this game will have the longevity of, say ""the Festival game"".Thomas Saves the Day, probably won't be as entertaining to the adults - especially the somewhate repetitive music interludes when traveling. But my son loved it, so what can I say?"
5,Everything that was advertised,"The product was delivered on time and worked out of the box.it's everything that you need, and would want and expect from a purchase."
5,great business card wallet,"Got this as a gift to hold gift cards. Excellent quality leather, construction and value. Wish it came in other colors!"
4,Fantastic fun,"Although the graphics are showing of a game that's clearly not from recent years, Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds is fantastic. The gameplay is addictive if you like a your strategy games. Even running on a 64 Bit copy of Windows 7 it's easy enough to get this working. Simply download yourself Smack32w.dll from somewhere if you're having that trouble, bung it on compatability mode with Windows 98 with Visual themes, desktop composition and display scaling on high DPI settings all disabled and it runs like a dream.I'd highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the War of the Worlds and is equally into gaming. Buy this and you won't be disappointed at all."
4,Great Listening,Was great here early songs from Del that were never released. Would recommend if you like Del Shannon. Good Listening
3,Not really recommended,"We got it for infrequent use, feeling that the cost of a good brand (I.E. KD tools) was not justified as we rarely have need for pliers like this - they work, however the quality leaves a lot to be desired. They are all too flimsy, and rather ""loose"", and, as well, the business end jaws are basically just stamped steel - they have no edge to grip the clamp, and kept slipping off on first use attempt. Problem was solved by taking a file and filing an ""edge"", like a cold chisel - about 60 degree angle) into the jaws and then they would work, but as flimsy as they are, we'll probably end up getting a quality tool from Snap-On and toss these in the scrap pile - the time wasted trying to make them work cost us more than if we'd bought a quality pair!Not recommended for a pro shop, but if you need em once or twice in a few years period, they'd be an OK buy - but note you may need to ""mod"" them a little with a file.."
3,"Fine for what it is, but overpriced for what you get","The authors attempt to tailor their writing to Ph.Ds who wish to pursue careers outside of academia. This is an admirable goal, as this is a genre in which relatively little has been written. Unfortunately, WEYCDWAPhD doesn't add significantly beyond what one finds in most job-seeking books, mostly relegating itself to basics like how to write a resume, how to interview for a job, etc. Their use of the Myers-Briggs personality indicator to guide readers to jobs which fit their personalities was fine, if necessarily abbreviated because of the book length. I liked the chapter on negotiating, as that is something too many get-a-job books for new graduates don't cover enough - I suppose because those books' intended readers often have no advanced skills to barter with, something not true of this book. ... However, this would be a good acquisition for university job centers or libraries."
1,"Great, until it stopped working just a little over a year.","Bought this as a X-mas gift for my parents. It worked great for just over a year and then the screen just went blank. E-mailed Audiovox and got no response. The place I bought it from said it would cost $100 to send it to Audiovox to repair, but I paid less than that for the actual frame. I could have gotten a lemon, but I would hope it would have worked for at least beyond a year. Just a warning to others."
5,Fun!,"I love children's books that tell stories, and this storyline is entertaining, as well as, motivating for children with a low self esteem. My children and I enjoyed the author's writing style, including a western accent... that I would try to imitate while reading. I would highly recommend this book for every children's library."
4,Good but with a minor worry,"I love this bracelet. It's a beautiful piece of jewelry. Because it has to be bent to be adjusted, put on and removed, I worry that it will break."
3,May or may not get wall mount hardware,"Like others have noted, mine came with no mounting hardware. It says in description it is wall-mountable, and the instructions refer to the mounts, but none were included. It is not possible to easily mount this without their hardware. I have sent mine back for a return, really hoping the replacement has the hardware included otherwise it too will be going back.-- Update - the replacement came very quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. It did include wall-mount hardware, so I now have what I need. Upped the rating to 3*, as the unit is good, but do be aware if you order you may or may not get the wall-mount hardware included."
3,Got My Fingers Crossed,"Haven't tried the machine yet, but it arrived with the top ajar obviously having taken a hard shot somewhere along the line. The exterior isn't scratched or cracked. I contacted the supplier and they quickly put me in touch with a service tech., who told me how to remove and reinstall the top. Now we'll see if the unit works."
1,Not worth the money,"This was a tremendous disappointment, given the Gaggia reputaiton for quality. The flimsy plastic handle to the portafilter broke in half in under a month. The machine is very bulky, noisy and cleaning it requires a Phillips head screwdriver, a socket wrench and an Allen wrench--and it needs cleaning often. Th eplatic looks much cheaper than the cost.It is fussy about tamp and grind. It requires frequent decalcification.Customer service does not respond to voicemails.Save your money."
1,No customer support in USA,After 13 months of use the heating element just died. When looking on-line on the Gaggia web site the only contact information they have is a phone number in Italy open 3 hours 3 days a week. During the year of use (I always find it interesting that reviews are given usually when the product is new)I had to repeatly prime and clean the steam line. Also for some reason the machine pulled vacuum and pulled grinds back up into the filter. I had to remember to remove the dispenser while it was still hot to prevent this.I am not at all happy that there is no way to contact them.
2,"Weak, slighly entertaining read","I have to admit that at first I really enjoyed this book. It drew me in, but not because it is especially well written, simply because I needed an easy read. As I read on I came to dislike the main character more and more. She lacks all common sense and the least bit of intelligence. There is no basis give for the love between Milo and Charlotte; it appears very one-dimensional. The ending of the book is a complete cop-out. There are some slightly interesting thought brought out through out the book, but not enough to make it worth reading."
1,Whiteout the pages...,"If your considering purchasing this book, please think again. The title is catchy, but the contents of this story are not. The plot of the story is told to you in the cover, Charlotte (the white girl) is brutually attacked, and doesn't remember anything, whether her husband, who's black attacked her, or someone else...The entire book doesn't have any substance, nor does it cover what is suppose to be the plot of the story...Put your energy into reading another book, and not this one..."
3,"Good, but not as good as Solti","This is a worthy performance in the Boult tradition. Slightly plodding but with lots of telling detail that is very well recorded. Quite comparable with the George Hurst version on Naxos but nowhere near the stature of Solti's incandescent performance on Decca. If anyone thinks that Solti's is perhaps a little overdramatic, they should listen to Elgars own recording which shows how accurate and close to the composer's intentions Solti was."
2,further leather bar music in gran canaria,"I actually own aol and alcazar music but only select tracks. However, i do own all the vacuum music and this was and is by far bard's most inventive venture!!On writing an album of camp cheesy songs you are bound to put out a couple that are decent i guess.... and thats just by the chance of probability. Non of them are great songs they are just a collection of songs aimed at under 18's or over 40's singing in their cropped tops and drinking cava before they go out for a night on the town. The reason this is not released in the uk is because we have a credible music scene and we did ""steps"" 5 years ago! If only europe would catch up! Clearly british people don't want to dance around in spandex shorts drinking tia maria with a straw to this hi energy 80's rubbish"
4,early,Came earlier than I had planned... Rags is my son's favorite movie and he is going to be so stoked that we were able to find it on dvd. He is also a Big Time fan so that just a perk!!! Only reason why its not ranked higher is because I havent opened and view the tape yet as it is a Christmas gift
5,He Gives Me Fever,"I have been looking for another copy of this album for years. James Cotton is everything that you ever want to hear in the blues. He's raw, he's soulful, he sweet, he's in pain, he's sexy, he screams, wails, moans, croons, and he plays a mean harp. Wherever you need to go, James can take you there with buckets of sweat and soul. Listen to Fatuation, I Don't Know, One More Mile, and the best version of Fever ever made and you'll be hooked."
1,Amazon messed up order,"Somewhat difficult to review the item since Amazon totally messed up the order and ""can only offer a refund at this time..."" I never received the charger and that doesn't help me out when I need to replace a lost battery charger. Probably one of the last items I will ever attempt to order from them."
1,Didn't Last Long Enough for What It Cost,Failed After Only 6 Months and a Dozen UsesSeemed to be very handy be able to charge one battery and shoot video with the other on the camera. I only used this a dozen times before it failed. Sent to Canon but is listed as unrepairable. Difficult to spend this amount on a charger only to have to replace it in six months.
5,A Nice Little Toy for Small Birds,"I've bought many of these exact little toys for my finches and it is just the right size, color, and weight for them.They pick it up and fly around with it and toss it about.They ignore all other toys."
5,"Boynton's Greatest Hits: Volume II (The Going to Bed Book, Horns to Toes, Opposites, But Not the Hippopotamus)","These books are GREAT for babies, and older children enjoy them, too. I got them for my grand daughter's first birthday, and they were a hit! They are imaginative, appealing, engaging, and fun!"
2,Blah!,"I realize children's books should be straightforward and silly, but I am not a Boynton fan. I own eight of her books, and I don't like any of them. Even my six-month-old DS is bored by them, and he's been fascinated by books since 6 weeks. I was afraid he was too young for books, but then I figured out that he just doesn't like these. He will sit, fascinated, through a longer library book with beautiful pictures and large pages, while he just wants to chew on these books. If I were to choose, though, Volume II is better than Volume I. There is humor in ""But Not the Hippopoatmus"" and ""Horns and Toes."""
1,Pass on this one.,Approximately 100 pages of choppy and poorly edited text. Reads like a school report nicked from an encyclopedia. Much better books on the subject are available.
1,Cut and paste job,"This book purports to capture the fire and spirit of the famed 1950 ""Whiz Kids"". If it did it would be a welcome addition to the definative story of the ""Kids"" told by Robin Roberts and Paul Rogers. Unfortunately it is little more than an elongated term paper. Anyone with an adequate amount of research time and a microfiche of Philadelphia newspapers from the period could have produced the same, perhaps better, results.The author chronicles the season from begining to end but in the interim, his narrative is sadly unable to capture either the drama of the season or the personality of the team. There is no effort to get behind the headlines and boxscores to the real story within the story.Save your time and money or, better yet, spend it on the Roberts/Rogers version of the Whiz Kids historic season. Their book is a page turner that will not disappoint you."
4,JUST THE FACTS,I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and really felt like I was part of the team and their quest for the National League pennant. While the book doesn't break any ground it does feed the baseball fanatic with statistics......one of my favorite things about the game.
4,"good book, needs newer version","I recently read this book and thought it was very helpful. It gave great information and kept it simple. She is a good writer, but she needs to write an updated version. In this book, the Internet hasn't been invented yet and sending copies of things by disk sounds like going to the moon. Still, it's worth the money if you're not interested in digital portfolios and it still has good information in it."
4,Great SF info!,I lived in SF for ten years and this book was great at reminding me of fun places I used to go to (and wanted to return to) and new places to try. Great assortment of maps. The book is segmented in a very helpful way.
3,outdated but okay,"if you have an Android or iPhone, you can probably find a cheaper app that will do a better job. The maps and small and hard to read. Not bad for getting a general idea of an area, but for navigation purpose, the GPS or iphone was easier and more useful. Some of the restaurants are outdated, so make sure you have an updated copy. The public transportation is a good info, but again MUNI just got rid of a bunch of lines in 2010 so make sure you have an updated copy."
3,Could Be Better,I was somewhat disappointed with this concert. The audience was pretty stiff and did not seem to get into the music as much as other international audiences. Maybe they were unfamiliar with the music selections? Andre Rieu is always good but some of his other concerts have been outstanding while this one was mediocre.
5,Andre Rieu,"I have always enjoyed Andre Rieu and his music and orchestra. He plays so well in this one, a real toe tapper! Excellent."
4,Not her best.,"This album is okay, but not her best work. If you really like Monheit, as I do, you'll want this one too."
3,great service from this provider.,"As this book had to come all the way to Australia, I was really surprised at how fast it arrived. I know my husband will be surprised to get this present on Christmas Day."
3,interesting mix,"Interesting mix of guitar oriented fusion and songs sung in Finnish. Really enjoyed the instrumentals, although not particularly the vocals. Had been curious about this artist and the price was right. Not sure if I would have paid the $15 or so, if not more for an import, so try to listen before you buy."
4,It could be a little bigger,"The ice bucket could be a little bigger, but overall very satisfied. It matches the wine bucket that came with our pots and pans."
2,Does not work with Blackberry Storm,"I purchased this item thinking it would be great to have with my Blackberry Storm phone and even on thier website where you can buy the tips, it says the tip will work for Blackberry 9500 and 9530, but even thou I have the 9530, it should work just fine as there is no power input difference between the phones. My bet and guess it that the power up unit probably does supply at least 5v output, but not enough mA which I believe needs to be 500mA or above to power the BB Storm phone. So, this unit it useless for me now, but it is a good concept and did work great with my roomates Samsung phone. Power Up needs to fix this so that it supplies more output in Amperage."
5,Fun Read,"This was great. I don't have time to give it a proper review, but I wanted to leave something for it. I have read a lot of what is out currently for this genre and this was the best I have read in a while. The plot is not complex but it is not boring either. I truly enjoyed it fully. It it kind of a Kit Whitfield's Benighted and Robin McKinley's Sunshine uniqueness."
1,Watching your great grandmother eat peas is more exciting...,"This movie is horribly boring - the acting is laughable. I am sure that the director's cinematic interpretation of Bataille's ""The Eye"" is much more interesting than this poor poor movie. Stay away from this unless you want to see a prime example of what happens when a young filmmaker tries to be a Prima Donna and fails miserably."
4,Making it Real,There are so many books out there which talk about 'brand' -- finally here's one that will really help me connect the dots between brand and business strategy. As competitive advantages become harder and harder to maintain -- knowing how to 'operationalize' the brand will be the key difference for the future.
1,This PDA kit is total trash.,"I had ordered this as I thought: ""how bad could it be for less than three dollars... and why not risk it?"" Trust me, don't buy this. It just arrived, and is complete trash. Worst of all, there is no way to keep the PDA in the case, except by applying velcro-backed stickers to the PDA itself! Also the case is really, really bulky. Huge.Please don't buy this. It's not worth a cent."
4,Want more,"Other than the 2nd side of Blue Cheer's ""New Improved this is all we have from Randy but the bonus 8 tracks are a joy and with a real bass player and all I can say is I want more..."
2,THE RIVER MURDERS is nasty and foulmouthed.,"A nasty foulmouthed murder story about a middle-aged homicide detectivewhose ex-bed partners - about a hundred of them - are dropping like flies,killed by a handsome freako who thinks he's revenging his unborn dead brothersand sisters.The star. an out of condition Ray Liotta, is miscast as the homicide detective.The River Murders is a dark story with religious content bordering on thesacrilegious, containing sexual elements of the old X rated porn flicks, couldhave been something special, or at the least watchable, if in the hands of anexperienced or mature director. But as is, The River Murders looks like it wasmade by and for fifteen year old boys.On the plus side, the director Rich Cowan has given up directing and isrunning for Congress in Washington state's 5th District."
1,Bad at its Best,"If you are a Ray Liotta fan you may like it, but the story is bad, and sick on top of that. The only thing I can say good about this dvd is the reproduction of it is good, as good as some blue ray disc I have seen. This movie is better left unseen by anyone, when Christian Slater ask Ray Liottas character if he had f***** is mother, you should be looking for the stop, and open buttons on you dvd player. The movie only goes down from there. Ray Liotta has done some good movies, but this is not one of them. If I were asked about this movie, I would say DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The River Murders,"Starts off Good then just goes downhill,A Priest of course has to be involved and not in the best light sadly.Not Ray Liotta or his Funny Accented Wife can save the movie,Pretty much vulgar and sick.But I am sure that was the goal to shock in order to create ""Art"" which I have always found to be faux-art. The movie had potential but once it uses Religion in a negative Light to advance The Film makers agenda hidden or not then the movie is no longer a movie but a statement and therefore becomes just another form of bigotry."
4,Liotta alone makes the movie watchable,"If anyone other than Liotta had been in the movie it wouldnt have been worth watching. As usual the man comes through. A VERY underrated actor, partially because of a short term problem with drugs and alcohol, the man has ""cleaned up"" and even when he was having his ""problems"" I cannot recall seeing a movie that he appeared in that I didnt like.I do recommend this movie."
5,"Best ""The Voice"" CD I Own","Sinatra and Jobim teamed up to make the finest ""bossanova"" music ever. Be sure to be in a quiet place as the entire CD is sung very softly and the backup music is very soft. The remastering of a 1969 original issue is flawless. It sounds like it was cut yesterday. The Girl From Ipanema, of course, is the first track. My other favorites are Change Partners, Quiet Nights Quite Stars, I Concentrate on You and Baubles, Bangles & Beads. I grant that some of the Portugese translations to English wind up being ""simple"", but the music is GREAT. Many tracks are in English and perfect!"
5,Reflective music,"I'm not much of a Sinatra fan, but I really found this CD easy to listen to and especially enjoyed the arrangements by Jobim. Frank sings the songs with such feeling, I can understand why he was popular for so long a time."
2,"I love both performers, but I was disappointed by this CD.","I love both performers, but I was disappointed by this CD. I didn't feel these arrangements brought out the best in the both of them as I had hoped. I was simply bored."
4,A Classic,"This is a smooth album from 2 of the most listenable musicians of their era. I grew up on Jobim, Getz, Gilberto and have a fairly extensive knowledge of the songs of Jobim. There could have been a few more Jobim songs that I would have liked to be included(altogether the songs are not the cream of his compositions).I am wondering where 'Agua de Beber' is. I've heard it performed by Sinatra before and I thought it was on this disc.The best cuts are Girl from Ipanema, Change Partners and Baubles, Bangles and Beads. I love this album for these cuts and usually play it late at night.A classic."
4,Great duet!,"On this album Sinatra recorded bossa nova and brazilian jazz songs of Antonio Carlos Jobim, brazilian jazz king, who is featured here on guitar and backing vocals. Only three songs that are not written by Jobim are Change Partners (written by Irving Berlin), I Concentrate On You (written by Cole Porter) and Baubles, Bangles and Beads (written by Forrest and Wright) Very quiet album, arrangements were done by Claus Ogerman. This is probably one of his best albums from the sixties."
5,Bossa Nova At Its Most Sensual and Beautiful,"This is one of my all-time favorite Sinatra recordings; certainly the most serene and warm. Sinatra saves his softest, most intricate singing for bossa nova classics like ""Dindi,"" ""Girl from Ipanema,"" and the gorgeous ""Once I Loved."" The pair even rethink several standards in the bossa nova style; listen to ""I Concentrate on You"" from this album with his brassy version on ""Sinatra's Swinging Session"" to see what I mean. A true classic, and worthy of an entire Sinatra-Jobim collaborative collection."
1,Horrible Amazon Service,"DO NOT buy the Total Gym through Amazon. Mine arrived broken and unusable with 2 of the 4 glide wheels broken into pieces. I have been calling and emailing Amazon for a couple weeks about this and keep getting automated messages saying they will get back to me, and they have not. Now I have had to pay 25% of what it cost to begin with, all over again, to order replacement parts. I will never be ordering through Amazon again, this is ridiculous."
4,Using the Total Gym Since 2006,"I use the Total Gym between sports in my home gym with a treadmill, weights and a punching bag. I like the Total Gym because you can do exercises super fast but i have the gym set to the max. weight resistance and I use additional weights with a weight vest, hand weights, bar bells, ankle and wrist weights."
4,Great workout,I've had my Total Gym for over a year now. The only drawback I've found it that it doesn't come with the foot attachment. I don't miss that so much since I also use an eliptical trainer and treadmill. It is awkward to fold up and move but I'm fortunate in that I leave it set up in my workout room. Gives a great upper body workout. I rehabbed a rotator cuff injury on it that I thought would require surgery. I've regained full range of motion. Saved me a small fortune. Also can do a lot of pilates on it. Shopping for another one as I write so I don't have to adjust the height.
4,Very pleased with the holster,"This Galco ankle holster was exactly what I was looking for. It fits well and is comfortable to wear. Honestly, I have no complaints with it so far."
5,Probably the best ankle holster out there,"Probably the best ankle holster out there. Strap holds gun in if you have to run, comfortable. Nice compact design, works good."
3,Does not work on some Dual G4s,"I got this card for my MDD 1GHz DP G4, and was able to easily install it, the only problem being with the layout of the MDD G4, which has a huge heat sink, which makes it slightlydifficult to get the sata wire to the drive.Once the system came up, it recognized the drive (Segate 200GB 7200.8) and I was able to format it into three partitions.Unfortunately I ran into trouble trying to copy any file larger than a few K. Getting the repeating error message:kernel: SIIG3114ATAR1::handleTimeout: SIIG3114ATAR1 Command handleTimeout for channel(3)kernel: IOATAController device blocking bus.After calling SIIG tech support, they quickly determined that I had a Dual G4, and that they had not been able to reproduce this problem (not their exact words) And indicated that it may not work for my system. I am in the process of returning it.Amazon forces me to give this a rating - so I gave it a 3, since I have no idea how well it works on other systems."
5,great combination of useful tools,"Have used these only for a couple of weeks. The trimmer has a strong cut, and the blower works well on walks, driveways and patios to get the small trash away. The ""hangers"" are not as easy to mount as I woulod have expected, especially the battery charger."
4,Great outdoor power tool set,"We've been using this set for years - works great! Mostly I use the string trimmer (as most will I assume) and it's perfect. I've replaced the spool once and it was super easy and they sell them at every local hardware store cheaply.The hedge trimmer works good even on cutting branches too. I have only used the blower a few times, but it's great!Only complaint is they're a bit heavy because of the batteries, but a gas powered one is way heavier so this really isn't a fair complaint."
1,REALLY BAD BUY!,"I just received my Lawncare Center last Friday. By the time I am through doing 2-3 hours worth of yard work with this equipment, it will have taken me 5 days. I used both batteries to trim 1/2 of my backyard and the batteries had to go back to the charger. The second day, I used both batteries to do the second 1/2 of my backyard. The third day, it took both batteries to do my entire front yard, which is really small. I'm certain it will take both batteries to trim my hedges tonight and then I will be back at it tomorrow to blow off my drive and walkway. So far, everything works great when there is a new, full charge; however, that will last only about 15-20 minutes per fully-charged battery. REALLY BAD PURCHASE considering it should take only a couple hours out of ONE day per week to perform ALL yardwork at my home.If I find I just have bad batteries and I am able to get my yard work down to 1 day, I will be glad to amend my review and publish my findings."
3,Battery Life is weak,"It's a good concept, but after a year of use, the batteries are weak, and do not hold a good charge."
3,Leaf Blower is Wimpy,"I give two out of three tools high marks, but the leaf blower is pretty pathetic. It's perfectly suited for blowing off a patio or porch or sidewalk before company arrives. But the blower sucks so much power from the battery that it doesn't last more than 5 or 6 minutes when it has 'real' work to do. As another user mentioned, at least one of the batteries will no longer hold a charge.The other two tools are perfectly satisfactory; the hedge trimmer does a nice job on smaller branches but of course isn't meant to tackle serious brush. The weed whacker is my favorite of the tree items and does a wonderful job.In hindsight I would have bought a better leaf blower had I known it was going to be such a disappointment, but as it is I use it strictly for patio leaves and sidewalk tidying."
4,so far so good,"Everything seems to work just fine. It's definitely not as powerful as a gas powered engine but for little small jobs (or for mom's), this is a perfect buy.I have decent size yard and it used 2 batteries for the weed eater and a battery and a half for the blower.The weedeater is a little difficult to get into tight spots... the guard is very large and the 12"" cord is kind of small. The 3 battery charger is great and it works with my cordless drill so now I have 4 batteries - can't have enough batteries in life!"
1,"Batteries suck, period.","B&D is dumping overstock, the batteries are horrendous. NiCad is old technology. Worst is that you can't switch over to lithium. I'v had a trimmer and blower for 2 years, 3 batteries, all dead. Cheaper to buy a new set with lithium battery instead of purchasing replacement batteries. You will be disappointed with this purchase."
1,short battery life,I bought the lawn care center directly from black and decker in May 2010 Right away I bought an additional battery and charger so I could trim and blow the same day. One battery would no longer take a charge before the 2 year warranty period but was not replaced by B&D Another battery died shortly after the two year period. I could have bought a lot of fuel for the $80 cost of two more batteries.
2,Extremely Short Duty Cycle,"Extremely Short Duty Cycle: Just received, charged the batteries overnight and less than pleased that each battery lasted no more than 15 minutes of use on the leaf blower. Will try another cycle but if this is normal - they will go back. Nice to not have to lug around the corded model but 15 minutes is inadequate."
2,Horrible Batteries kill a great product,I've had these tools for a year now and I have already had to buy four more replacement batteries. They do not last and they die very quickly. These batteries are like your inkjet cartrige on your printer...expensive and you are replacing them all the time.
3,satisfied but not ecstatic,"I am very happy about the quality of the items in this bundle pack but disappointed with the battery life per charge, even with having two batteries. I would still recommend purchasing this item even with the battery life per charge issue."
2,Trimmer and Blower,"I bought the trimmer first and it worked fine, but took me three batteries to complete my trimming and edging. I bought the blower a week later and laughed at it's power. The thing is barely more powerful than a hair dryer. I decided to return both items because if I'm going to get my exetnsion cord our I might as well use it for my trimmer too and save the money. It's too bad that B&D have not created a more powerful 18V blower. It's a nice concept to have rechargeable power tools."
4,Great tools for a small yard,"This combination of tools is great for my small yard. I just have two small areas of grass and some hedges around the perimeter, and after about 4 weeks of service I've yet to even deplete one battery. The weed whacker works just as good as any I've used, and the hedge trimmer works even better than I expected. It clips easily through Oleander bushes that can be a bit tough and tangled. The blower is okay, but not as strong as my plug-in one. It will clear hard surfaces and light leaves on grass, but anything else on grass and it just moves things around. The wall mount hanger, included, for both the batteries and the tools, was an unexpected surprise and really made storage easy."
3,black & decker 18-volt cordless electric lawncare center,"As most other reviews, systems are ok batteries should have a longer run time. Weakest point are the batteries, best points no gas no cord clean machines"
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT. I GOT TIRED OF STARTING MY WEED EATER & BLOWER BY HAND.I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE THIS A TRY AND LO AND BEHOLD I WISH THEY HAD THIS 20 YEARS AGO. I USED THIS GROUP OF TOOLS TO TRIM AND EDGE AND THEN BLOW OFF THE GRASS OFF MY PATIO AND DRIVEWAY. I THEN TRIMMED MY BUSHES. I DIDALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 30 MINUTES AND USED ONE BATTERY.THE ONLY NEGATIVE THING I MIGHT HAVE, IS THAT THE STRING TRIMMER DOESN'THANDLE THE REAL HIGH AND HEAVY STUFF VERY WELL. BUT I HAD EXPECTED THAT SO I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED."
2,Defective,Blower and hedge trimmer work great(so far). Weed/edge trimmer broke after second use.Only used it on weeds. Motor runs but head will not turn. Seems like the drive snapped inside.Having no luck in returning it.
2,Fantastic photos,"A problem with self-publishing is that there are many opportunities to miss important publication steps like a simple copy-edit for grammar. The pictures in this book are lovely; the text is full of grammatical errors. Still, the authors' love for Point Reyes shows."
2,Entertaining,"-Fun game-Zero replay valueIt's one of those games where you play it then throw away, or sell it and hope you get some money back."
3,This is NOT the first serial,WARNING! This is not the first serial of Flash Gordon. Instead it's the complete third serial named FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE. But if you're searching for this title you will be pleased.
1,Never worked for even a minute!!,"Absolute garbage, this supply didn't work from out the box. The LED lights but charge to laptop was pulsing for a fraction of a second every 10 seconds or so. Delivered ZERO charge to my Sony VAIO laptop over two hour period. My laptop simply entered auto-hibernation due to lack of charge !!!"
2,I can't believe it!...,I can't believe it! My DVD version looks better than this BLU RAY version. It's hard to believe that companies can release blu ray versions of a movie when they don't even improve the quality. I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan and love this movie. I am extremely disappointed. I'm glad I only spent $6.
1,Disney disaster,"Disney has apparently bought the rights for U.S. distribution of Jackie Chan videos originally made in Hong Kong. Fair enough, but Disney has done a tremendous disservice to the American audience by not allowing them to see the original movies. Instead, they have dubbed over the original Cantonese dialogue with insipid English lines, taking out most of the humor of the original in the process. They have cut scenes and replaced the original music score with inappropriate and uninspired music of their own. I suspect the hatchet job on Project A is typical. The original is one of Jackie Chan's best movies (and that is saying a lot). The music, the dialogue, the plot, and the action stunts were all inspired and inspiring. Disney has turned what has once a wonderful movie into a mediocre action movie at best. I would recommend avoiding Hong Kong movies tampered with by Disney, though this is, unfortunately, hardly possible anymore in the U.S."
3,I was expecting more.,"I did not enjoy this biography as much as other books on the Hanover Royal Family. I was hoping for a more reader friendly text. This biography reads more like a history book, than a book about real people. It did not have the insights and humanity of other books. I was left feeling that I did not know any more about the Princesses than I did before."
3,"Interesting subject, difficult reading","The six daughters of King George III have been overlooked by biographers for too many years. Therefore I had high hopes for Princesses. Unfortunately it was one of the most difficult biographies I have ever read. Flora Fraser painstakingly read and researched hundreds of existing letters written by the princesses as well as others involved in their lives, and it seems she made use of each and every one of them - to the point of annoyance. To borrow a line from Shakespeare, Fraser needs to be told ""More matter with less art"". The writing is dense, arty, and agonisingly slow to read, and too many pages are spent rehashing insignificant details. These pages would have gone to better use going into more depth about the personalities, characters, and personal relationships of the women. For all that, the subject of the princesses' lives is piquant, moving, joyful, and tragic. But is it worth such headache and laborious reading?"
4,Blues Rock with Melody,"This CD features a strong vocal presence over the twin guitar powers of Holt & Grissom. The guitar interplay is never over the top, which is a good thing. Playing perfect counter parts these two axemen set up a cool blue rock/r & b vibe. Add on the late-great SRV's rhythm section and you've got one fantastic act. ""Born Without You"" rocks nicely with the Clash (""Should I Stay or Should I Go"") sounding chord progression. If you like Lang,Mellencamp or the Austin sound, try these guys."
4,"Into the ""Wild""?","Hikers and backpackers, read this book before you hit the trails this spring. Kim Todd's book will change the way you look at the natural world. Her essays describe how many of our common animals, plants, and insects are not native to this continent, but were brought here--accidentally or on purpose. Todd has unearthed the stories and personalities behind these introductions of exotic species, creating readable narratives that are based on solid research. (The book also has an extensive bibliography.) One of my favorite aspects of this book: the attention Todd pays to the smaller creatures--not just charismatic megafauna but also mosquitoes, honeybees, and gypsy moths. This book is written with intelligence, humor, and style (it also happens to be beautifully printed and illustrated). One last word: This book doesn't just focus on nature as ""wilderness."" The author includes urban environments as part of the natural world, with investigations into pigeons and starlings."
