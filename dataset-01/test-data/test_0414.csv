5,Excellent,"Excellent CD for children. My son was having trouble falling asleep, we used this CD and he is sleepng well."
4,What you get.,"Box set contains: 3042 Alaska: Outrage At Valdez, 3043 Lilliput In Antarctica, 3044 Papua New Guinea: The Center Of Fire, 3045 Tahiti: Fire Waters, 3046 Pioneer Of The Sea, 3047 Amazon: Snowstorm In The Jungle & Rigging For The Amazon. First four tapes are appx. 48 min., Pioneer is appx. 99 min., and Amazon is appx. 73 min. Also includes 32 page booklet on Cousteau history through 1990."
2,disappointing,"totally superficial review based on the hardcover edition. big, large cover, looks like a textbook not a critical history, i have no interest in going to the library and spreading this textbook out on a large table and digging in. textbook presentation of the volume does not appeal to the way i like to use most books. material looked interesting, but also presented in a topic by topic textbook fashion. i sent it back"
3,Good Survey Work,"Pro: Good survey of ancient warfare from Ancient Egypt and Sumeria through the Roman Empire. Physical quality is excellent. The authors are knowledgeable and competent. Extensive use of drawings, maps and art work is useful and effective.Con: Nothing really new here - much of the excellent art work is borrowed from older works. The authors cover the topics well but do not offer more insight into ancient warfare then previously offerred by earlier out-of-print works by authors such as John Wharry, Sir John Hackett, and Peter Connolly.Bottom Line: If you need just one general purpose book on the subject, this does the job well. If you need more than a survey of ancient warfare, take a pass on this book and go after the works listed in the bibliography."
3,Okay survey,"My edition claims to have ""new battle maps"", referring to the large bird's-eye views of some important battles. These views give a general idea of the battlefield, but the representation of troop types and movements is crude at best. It is instructive to compare, for example, the siege of Alesia as shown here with the suspiciously similar view in Goldsworthy's earlierThe Roman Army at War. Goldsworthy labels key features, whereas Fighting Techniques just provides a few points about the campaign in numbered callouts that are scattered more or less randomly around the page. The actual information conveyed by the image could have been given in a quarter-page line drawing rather than a two-page spread.This is a decent survey, but not to be preferred to Goldsworthy's book, to the equally usefulWarfare in the Classical Worldby John Warry, or to Peter Connolly'sGreece and Rome at War."
3,Good Product for the small amount of money,I just bought this today and I like the easy to use features once you set everything up its easy to use. But it doesnt have a lot of games on it and it doesnt have a calendar which I would prefer for my personal use. I also think that the word translator doesnt work very well. Overall for the cheap price this is a good product.
2,dissapponted,"I bought this to use as a translater but 90% of the words I enter are not found. If you want a translater, don't buy this product."
2,Seriously Disappointed,"I couldn't be more disappointed in this DVD. After receiving it I noticed that it was only in stereo (not even the center channel is used). The video quality is OK, but most of the plays sound like the mic is about 20 ft away from the stage so most tracks sound like you are far away from the stage.Lastly I was disappointed in the camera work. While the mic is fixed, the camera follows the action. So even though the sound is moving from right to left (in stereo), the actor always appear in the center of your screen."
3,Rich Content but Complicated to Use,"A pity. Lots of good presentations but the CD is complicated to use. Moving from one title to other is a headache. Perhaps, the problem is because my DVD equipment is 3 years old. If so lucky ones with new equipment if not then revise the new DVD version."
3,"Not Traditional ""Baby Blue""","This is good quality paper and it does the job. My only complaint is that it's not a true/traditional ""baby blue"" like the name suggests. It's more of a bright green/blue. So if you truly want ""baby blue"" this is not the color you're looking for. Still it's a fun color of blue and makes a nice background."
1,Dog bowls...,"I am not pleased with this item. The rubber ""non-slip"" ring does not stay on the bowl and is a pain to keep putting back on the bowls. Already threw them in the back yard for water. Also, the edge of the bowl that is for preventing spills also prevents the dogs from getting their food."
1,"Derivative, no value added","I must say, I got a wonderful sense of deja vu reading the entries we compiled for our urban legends web site in someone else's book. This one is a collection of re-told urban legends with no insight or value added. Stick with Brunvand's works."
5,Simply the best Dragonlance book since Summer Flames,"Niles once again tell a fast-paced, historic tale about the fates the elven lands, with many well-known caracters such as Gilthas, Porthios, Alhana Starbreeze, and others. An excellent follow up on the novella The Sacrifice and the novel Dragons of Summer Flames."
1,To hard to use and too small,I got a deal on it but it is to hard to use and to small. Get a larger one!
5,brought me closer to the Lorda,I was able to understand grace in a simplified and loving attitude. It has helped me realize the work of grace in my life. The style of composition was excwellent which lent itself to easy reading. Wonderful book.
4,Gone to Texas / Blue River,"We ordered this DVD for the Gone to Texas video and it was very good. Blue River was an extra for us. It too was very good, but only a cameo showcase for Sam Elliott. Both were worth the purchase if you are a Sam Elliott fan."
3,An enjoyable watch,"I bought this because Sam Elliott was in both features, but is only a guest appearance in Blue River so have not yet watched this.Gone to Texas however gave me a wider understanding of Houston's life and career so will lead to wider reading and research. I was however distracted by poor make up, particularly beards and sideburns of the characters as these were easily identified as false in fact in some sideburns the stitching was visible at the edges.Another pleasant surprise was Katherine Ross as an Alamo survivor, along with Travis's slave sent to warn Houston and his army of what would befall them should Santa Anna capture them."
2,Blue River,"""Gone to Texas"" is story of Sam Houston--played by Elliott--and is quite well done.""Blue River""? Didn't care for it. Certain aspects seemed ""sick""."
1,A disappointment,"Although the fisher price blocks in this series (and associated toys) have been a major hit with our 12 month old son, this toy has been the biggest disappointment in the series. As other reviewers have states, it tips over easily, is difficult to balance, and is just plain boring! Our son has never given it a moment of his time. In our opinion, this combination set is only worth it for the fish-in-water block, which is the most interesting one in the whole series and can't be bought in any other set! I would skip this set, and try one of the other ones (the truck set has been a hit in our household)."
3,My son loves the blocks.....,"My son loves playing with the blocks, but shows no interest in the ark at all. I highly recommend the blocks, they are great for stacking and learning about different types of animals."
5,A cookbook with delicious AND healthy recipes!,"I have hundreds of cookbooks, but this one is going to be my favorite. I love dessert and have a hard time finding recipes that are healthy and that my family will enjoy. The recipes are easy and call for regular ingredients. There is nothing better than butter in a dessert and Sarah has found a way to use butter and still keep the recipe healthy.Great Job, Sarah!"
4,"works great, tastes awful",I realize this is a supplement and not a candy but YUCK. I don't mind the regular taste of Sambucus but the addition od Zinc and Vitamin C makes this taste like metal.
4,Great instrument plug-in!,"This plug-in rocks, in several ways. The samples are generally tremendous (I haven't even been through the entire library yet, so I haven't heard them all), great attention to making very musical, usable samples, with lots of subtle variations.But the best feature is the looping, particularly for the percussion - lots of variants on groove and feel, and with the auto-sync feature, they will auto start and lock to your project's tempo. I tend to plug in 16 variations, get them all sync'd, then mute and un-mute as needed.I only gave 4 out of 5 stars because I was a bit disappointed that the samples are 44K-16bit instead of 48k-24bit. (Would gladly pay for an upgrade if they render these at 24bit.)"
1,Not the color shown on website,"This color turned out to be a light grey color with just a hint of blue. While the gold and silver colors are good, this color wasn't even close to the rich blue shown on the company website."
2,Disturbing...but one of King's worst books,"Rage is a little different then your standard Stephen King book and the first of the now infamous ""Bachman Books."" It also has the stigma of having its publication permanently stopped after the Columbine shootings. It's not a typical horror novel - more like a psychological thriller. The book revolves around a high school kid that had a traumatic childhood that eventually comes out via several acts of escalating violence against the teachers and administrators in his school. He also takes an entire classroom hostage where they have some very bizarre interactions. Definitely not as good as most works by Stephen King. Does an admirable job of exploring the psyche of a tormented and mentally ill individual and it does make you think a little bit (particularly in the context of the world we live in 30+ years after it was first published). A chilling preview of what would happen at Columbine and other schools - but otherwise one of King's worst books."
3,ballet exercises for my granddaughter,I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHO WISH TO HAVE BALLET LESSONS. ACCORDING TO ME THIS VIDEO IS GOOD TO USE AS AN INTRODUCTION FOR BALLET HOWEVER IT IS NOT MAKING HER LONGING FOR MORE LESSONS.
2,a big disappointment,"This book has its good points, particularly where McGee is talking about how we got to where we are today, or analyzing the forces that make self-help what it is. But I don't really understand how that's supposed to help us find our way out of this mess, and to me, that's the crux of it: Okay, here we are, what do we do now? Really, the amount of practical advice in this book is nil. I realize that in a way if the author gave advice she'd be in effect writing a self-help book of her own, and that was not she set out to do. Still, you'd think that at the very least the book would help you understand which self-help program is better than which other program, where to go for real help if you need it, etc., and that's something McGee never gets around to doing. So in the end what's the point? Just to tell us what is? Anybody who's ever put on Oprah or Dr. Phil knows the score there without needing somebody like McGee to tell us."
5,Amazing,"If any human had the ability to record the heartbeat of the earth,this is what it would sound like.Check out the song: Lighthouse"
4,"good course, but","It's a good way to learn to speak the language on your own, especially given the extensive drills; however, the sound quality is fair to poor at times making it occasionally difficult to use in the car."
3,Getting used to it,"Nice looking shoes, really quality looking construction. The insoles on the shoes feel weird, they have a different design than the traditional soles of original ASIC wrestling shoes. After a couple of weeks I'm getting used to the feel when I'm walking in them. I don't see any advantage to the new design besides the new look."
2,disapointment,"i bought this bag in tan color. The package was open when I received it, and the brass parts of the bag were rusty, I had to polish them with some metal polishing solution. As a seller amazon should had done the polishing before sending it to the customer. Besides the bag does not worth the price at all. I was very disapointed."
5,Set of 10 batteries for pennies each,"I used these for an LCD clock and so far, 1 battery has lasted longer than a year. So for the price, these are great a deal."
3,Great price,"Great price but no shelf life date. So they work, but for how long is unsure. Recently bought batteries elsewhere that are good until the fall of 2019! On balance though, for this price, it doesn't matter. I've paid this price for ONE battery locally, so if a few of these die, no problem. If they were silver oxides instead of alkalines, they'd last 10 years (have for me anyway)."
4,Constantly Slated,"I dont understand the britsh public for constanlt slating one of our greatest artists. Melanie C has shown that yet again she has the song writing ability and talent to be a no1 solo star, Popular every where except her home territory. I own all of her albums and on listening to them in sequence you can hear Melanie maturing and getting better and better. This album is her best and must be bought by every fan to show commitment to her ability. You will not be dissapointed."
2,Lacks Accompaniment,"I think that Mr. Casals' playing is very fine but I was very disappointed that he chose to play these unaccompanied. Perhaps the pianist and chamber group could not be booked or miked appropriately due to the time. I was so disappointed in this production choice because the first and only other Bach cd I have, the goldberg variations by Uri Caine, blew me away: JS Bach was very ahead of his time in his use of electronic musics and freely improvised counterpoint and jazz musics, things that the rest of the ""classical"" world did not catch up to for another few centuries. Save your money on this one. Sorry, Pablo. I won't come to florida for you."
5,Great visor,I'm not really a Pirates fan but was looking for a visor because my son's little league team is the Pirates. I like this visor because it is well constructed and not too loud or flashy. It fits well and I'll definitely be using it after little league ends!
5,Wonderful Gift!,"I bought this pick for my husband, an aspiring acoustic guitar player. I added a few special touches of my own & presented it to him as a gift to encourage him to follow his dream. He LOVES this pick & wears it constantly. He's had many compliments on it & is very proud to show it off.I can't speak to its functionality as a pick to actually play an instrument with, but I can attest that it made the guitar player in my life very happy. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase."
3,Thoroughly researched and compelling - a rare mix,"It's a start... I wish Amazon would list your other work.It was great meeting you in Edmonton, and thanks for talking with us for as long as you did. I know you were tired. Your step mom sounds like a trip. If you're ever in Houston, look me up!"
4,good not great,I have read on some sites that this watch is usually mistaken for a Rolex which is baffling to me. The watch looks good but it is not even close to a Rolex. I like the watch but the only complaint i have with it is the fact that the steel looks somewhat dull. The steel on the Invicta watches are more appealing.
2,The Essential Raps by Ron Clark,"Not exactly what I expected it to be. I thought that there would be more songs on it. I will give it a try, but not sure if it will hold my sons attention to have him listen to continually to memorize."
3,Episodic story of one woman,"Adriane Gelki is a young woman with problems who tries to improve her life by living with ""abandon"", not worrying about the consequences of her actions. She is alternately likeable and exasperating as her attempts at change lead her to do some good things and also to sometimes act like what could most charitably be described as a spazz. Each chapter is a rather self-contained episode of her life. While the book is a fun read with a mix of serious and funny content, the problem I had with it is that it felt more like a series of short stories than a novel with a conclusion."
2,Hurray for Naxos! and Their Many Bargains ...,"... which often present little-known ensembles performing very fine but unfamiliar music. This time, however, they went astray. The Goldner Quartet doesn't have the art to play Szymanowski convincingly. At least that's what I hear, a technical struggle with the notes and an unpleasant dependence on heavy vibrato rather than natural phrasing to lend 'drama' to the performance. In no way is this recording comparable to that of the Schoenberg Quartet, which also gives you excellent renditions of the two Janacek quartets with the two Szymanowskis."
5,One of the Best,"I have collected and read books on UFO's for over 30 years. I currently have over 200 titles and OUR HAUNTED PLANET is one of the top ten. I actually have several copies of this book and loan it to friends who become interested in the UFO enigma. Keel was one of the first researchers who attempted to bring many of the unexplained paranormal phenomena under one umbrella of explanation. (I can think of only Charles Forte and Morris K. Jessup who preceded him.) The book is well researched and well-written. The concise three-page theory on the origin of man that incorporates all three popular theories (Devine creation, seeding, and evolution) is alone worth the price of admission. I'm glad this book is being republished and highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the paranormal--UFO's in particular."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I really recommend this book! For one, I couldn't put it down. There was a lot of information in this book that I have read from previous authors, such as Commander X and the like, but most interesting, was Keel included other stories regarding certain subjects. I really liked the part about ""radio anomalies"" for they were interesting...especially VLF (Very Low Frequency Waves). I really had to go back to the beginning of the book after the first chapter, and started highlighting things, because they were so interesting, I wanted to look them up later for more information or more books on the certain subjects. The whole book is practically highlighted! LOVED IT! And would probably definitely read it again, (which I normally don't ever do after reading a book once)."
5,An invaluable resource,This travel book is well researched and superbly written. I used it on my last trip to Ontario and could not imagine traveling without it.
4,First try looks ok,Tried it on a small surface on front window of new Toyota Fortuner. Had spots from hard water where wipers do not clean. Was easy to apply and looks completely clean again. Have not seen any scratches on window.
5,Removed incredibly hard water stains!!!,"My car had hard water spots due to sitting right next to a water sprinkler for 3 months while I was deployed. The water spots came off the paint surprisingly easily with a clay bar kit, but nothing would even make the water spots on the windows just a little better. I was almost resolved to having them for life when I found this product.I got it in 2 days with Amazon Prime, and 15 minutes later all of the water spots were gone. It works exactly as described. I followed the directions on the label and like magic the water spots were gone.I highly recommend this product!!!"
4,Works Well...Much Elbow Grease Required,"The product does remove hard water spots; even those that have remained on the glass for long durations. One must find a balance with the water and powder mix, expect to scrub and work hard to remove the spots, and severely spotted glass will take at least two applications and one to two hours to complete (by hand). In my experience, the best results occured when minimal water drops were used to obtain a thick pasty appearance with enough grit (during application scrubbing process) to remove the spots. The automotive glass cleaned with the product was severely hard-water spotted for about nine to eleven months. I would have rated the product five stars if it had worked with less scrubbing intensity or less time. Spot-X removed spots that normal glass cleaners and glass clay bars could not. The cost and time investment are less than the other alternatives: glass polishing, professional detailer, or glass replacement."
1,Beware search engine returns,"This product came up in a search on ""flannel sheets twin."" They aren't. There's no way to tell, since the description says ""100% cotton,"" just like I'd expect. They're being returned."
4,Scottie dog sheets,"I really like these sheets. They are very comfortable to sleep on. They are wrinkled after taking them from the dryer, but by the time they are put back on the bed, only small wrinkles remain."
4,good buy,"These pants do run a little big as the other review reads, I like the quality very well and mossy break up is great here in wv fall colors. Being a size bigger than expected works ok with me they will be worn as over clothes anyway."
4,Midweight?,"While these pants fit well and held their colors through a wash with soap void of bleach or whiteners, I would definetly not classify them as midweight but more as a light weight pant."
3,Stopped working after 6 uses,The HP PF725A worked great for 6 uses and then the red laser stopped working so I lost control of the cursor. I am going to go thru the Targus warranty process to get a replacement.
3,not what I expected,"I was hoping for more of a workout routine... this is a slow-paced dance instructional video. It gets you moving, but no really heart-pumping activity. Fun to learn new moves but won't work for my cardio."
3,Kit is a (...),"I have to admit that this book did have its high moments. But it was overall lacking the drama and intrigue that should have gone along with Tanis and Kit's first meeting. I didnt like the way that Kit acted throughout the story. There was a little action here and there, but the story was not as good as it could have been. It really made me not like Kit. I mean i know she is a fighter, and she doesnt care about anything cut her sword. But the way she acts in this story is totally degrading to her character, read it if you must, but this book could be easily skipped."
4,Very helpful,"I find that this book has been very helpful in my running and triathlon training. The first few chapters are very good, replete with some basic theory about running and remaining injury free.The second third of the book is very informative regarding injuries and their treatment.The last part of the book has great stretching exercises, and good information about how to stay injury free.My only criticism of the book is based on a comment that my physical therapist had. I've recently had big problems with sprained ankles in both feet and receive physical therapy from a PT specializing in runners. I discussed the book and the chapter on ankles with her and she mentioned that the chapter only describes the author's success and that for every successful treatment outcome, there are lots of not-so-total successes. It would be helpful to understand both.But overall, a worthy book to buy and read and re-read as the need arises."
1,"Avalon Coach Series Digital Stop watch w/Extra Large Display, #3250OR","This stopwatch does not have mechanical resistive feedback or click on its push buttons to feel it is put into operation. Due to this, it stops or starts up when you put it in your pocket and move aound or bump to something.I don't like this at all. When I requested for return or exchange for other model by e-mail, I have not received any reply.Do not buy anything from this outfit."
4,Fun Lionel Train,I bought this train for my Christmas 2007 for my son. It is a very nice lionel train. The only drawback is that some of the trim on the engine is fairly fragile plastic. It has already needed some super-glue. The engine is very nicely detailed with drive motors in each of the trucks (two). Overall I am very pleased.
2,"Beautiful Program, Poorly written","A good concept, I would enjoy reading more about the program, but it's a program that helps these teenagers, and I don't think he really bothered to learn enough about these teens...or at least didn't bother to talk about that. There are entire chapters in this book that aren't even relevant to the story. I wouldn't waste my money on this book, I checked mine out from the library and I'm still upset that it took up a good two hours of my life that I will never get back."
1,"Didn't ""click"" with me","This book is far from being the best read I've ever had like one other reviewrhere states. This in fact, could have been the absolute worst book I've ever read. Thank god I didn't pay for it and read most of it in the bookstore when I saw it in the cut-out bin. Save your cash."
5,Brilliant & Insightful,"You don't have to be a parent, an outdoor educator, therapist or teacher to enjoy this book. An interest in the state of youth today and the healing powers of the natural world are enough. Gary's simple, elegant and insightful prose captures the essence of what so many teens' lives are like today. And his keen understanding and appreciation of the natural world make this book worth reading. Read it. You'll love it."
4,The title is so true! I can't wait to re-read it!,Very accurate account of the wilderness therapy program at the Aspen Achievement Academy. Excellent reading for anyone interested in this approach to helping teens. It would be insightful for any parent considering this type of program for their adolescent.
3,The Kirk before James T. Kirk saves the universe.,"Commander George Samuel Kirk becomes involved in the lauching of a new spaceship the ""Enterprise"".In this prequel to the original Star Trek series, the epic story of the first mission of the Enterprise is told in a giant sized Star Trek novel.A Star Trek novel from the fringes of the Star Trek universe."
2,"""Pet Labrador Retriever"" by Frances Brewer","This small (80 pages) 1954 / 1958 Paperback is a very basic guide to Labrador Retrievers with a slant towards ""field Labs"". It is somewhat interesting from the perspective of being over 50 years old but there are plenty of newer books that are far more comprehensive as well as more up to date..."
5,i loved it,"just like every other ggd album it was great easy to listen to, a good beat just overall they rock. this is one band not to pass up."
3,so not the best no matter what anybody says,"this one is pretty much all about Mr. Butts, Doonesbury's answer to the times' obsession with smoking and kids who smoke. He was nothing more than a giant cigarette with an otherwise amiable face. He started out as a figment of Mike Doonesbury's imagination during his bout with smoking. This being turned into something much bigger as his friends Ms. N, a pack of nicotine gum - Mr. Jay, a weed smoke and Baby Tar, another smoke, came into being. I might add that Baby Tar is one of the worst rappers in the history of music.To be honest, other things starring major Doonesbury characters happen in this piece, but the smoking stuff is all that really matters. And it's all the best.Oh yeah, Duke gets wasted on booze and controlled substances while Honey stands by oblivious."
2,Do not judge a book by its cover.,"I very much so judged this CD by the cover and the description. If I had listened to a sample, I may have made another choice. I bought it and have tried to use it but have been disappointed so far by the music accompanying the speaker. It is too loud and at some points drowns the speaker out. The speaker's voice and message are just fine, in fact, they are what I would want. It is just that I am distracted by the music."
5,Great gift,"Gave this to my little grand-nephews, who enjoyed it very much. Also gave it to an adult ""big boy"" who is a tractor mechanic--he has a great sense of humor and shared it with his co-workers. Lots of smiles all around!"
4,Superb!,"This book is an update and a sensible at that from the 2.0 rules. I would have liked things, the planes themselves a bit more mapped out, but we are given plenty of info on how to do that, massive but concise information about the major planes. The planar monsters are pretty decent, but the inevitables are already listed. Plenty of info on how to make demi planes and planes of your own. I would have liked a plane of steam and a para elemental steam. I'm not thrilled about the magic items or the prestige classes but then again, I don't like to use either of these in the games I run. I think this is a good book about the planes that is well written and well balanced with very little more then you need. If you need a book about the planes this is it."
3,Not a necessity.,"The Manual of the Planes is only useful for campaigns/quests that venture off of the material plane, which in my experience is a rarity. It is, however, an excellent read unlike many other Dungeons and Dragons rulebooks. It goes in depth into the cosmology of the standard Dungeons and Dragons setting, as well as giving a guide to create a custom cosmology."
4,Excellent overview of the classic AD&D multiverse,"At long last, the very rarest of the core AD&D hardcovers! Appearing briefly in 1987, this masterwork finally revealed the planes of existence... you get complete details on spellcasting and adventure in the Elemental Planes, the Abyss, the Nine Hells, the Seven Heavens, Hades, and everything in between! And this is *not* the Planescape universe... all of this material is true to the original AD&D vision set out by Gygax, and thus totally compatible with Greyhawk, the Forgotten Realms, or your own campaign world. If you want to expand your campaign's depth and majesty into infinity, this is the book with which to do it!"
1,Text Books from Amazon-NEVER ORDER HERE,Tried to return a new workbook for my daughter who is a freshman at Stanford University. The ISBN# on line from Amazon(not a private seller) was not the correct ISBN# for the wookbook. Would not return or refund an unopened new item. Never try and order a textbook or workbook from Amazon. It's like flushing cash down the toilet.
2,"its prada, but I didn't really like it","I ordered this bag because like other people I was like holy moly a prada bag for 100 dollars. It did arrive well packaged and it certainly is real, but I just didnt love it, so I sent it back. I do think it would be good for a beach bag, but I don't like the beach and I don't know if I want people seeing what i'm carrying inside if I was just using it as a regular bag. It is prada so yes it is good quality, but I asked myself if I would have ever used it and the answer was no. :)"
3,Confusing,"I don't know if it the subject dance or the presentation, but it is very hard to absorb the moves presented or even remember them. It is not structured for graduated movement to/through the actual dance."
4,pretty neet,I found it to be a pretty good video I just wish it would have been longer. However it was an okay video for it's price.
3,THIS KILLER WHALE ATE MY 6 YEAR OLD!,"I think the title of my review pretty much sums it up. Don't buy this killer whale for your child unless you're prepared to fight it tooth and nail, and in the end pay the ultimate price."
3,For enthusiasts only,"An interesting look at what constituted a medieval best-seller. The book really picks up when whatever bunch of monks that pose as ""Sir John"" get past the Holy Land and its surrounding areas and visit China and Africa and just make crazy crap up by the boatload. Also some of the earliest forms of otaku-ism, since the Far East, though heathen, is only ever spoken of in great reverence.Definitely for a niche audience, as the detailed descriptions of furlongs and cubits are of little interest to a sustained narrative."
5,"A bit heavy-handed, but.....",....an excellent read for someone interested in dismantling stories to see what makes them tick. I learned from it and recommend it for anyone serious about serious writing.
5,Helped when doctors couldnt,"This book is excellent and highly recommended for anyone suffering from indigestion,reflux,bloating and other symptoms associated with the intestinal areas.By simply adding HCL to my regime and adjusting my diet I was able to resolve a troubling and, at times, frightening problem. Better still,this book armed me with knowledge that enabled me to deal with an illness when doctors were unable.I also avoided the pharmaceutical drug trap which is important to me."
3,Unanswered questions and lacking references,"I have been a long time GERD victim so I am hopeful that the acid supplementation the author recommends will work for me. However, I have unanswered questions. The author states that acid supplementation can eliminate heartburn in many people that have low acid levels. He does not explain how low stomach acid levels actually causes heartburn. He writes that the culrpit is the LES and not the acid, but he never closes the loop and explains how or if the low acid levels casues the LES to open. To me, this seems like an important part of the picture. My other gripe is that that he has no references for the core of his treatment plan: HCL supplementation. There are scores of references for other topics but none are about taking extra HCL. This leaves me wondering if he is the only proponent of HCL supplementation."
5,dr. Wright understands,"wright understands what our medical model doesn't. western medicine has been bought out by the pharmaceutical industry. Thinking ""outside the box"" Wright explains clearly how to get relief without using these toxic drugs. I was taking Prilosec several times a week with Tums in between. Now I am off all that and feel much healthier.Thank you to Jonathan Wright!"
4,A well structured and systematic approach to Constraint Programming,"The book is the outcome of research results by the author. The author's proof theroetic approach to different concepts and constraint solvers in this field is particular attractive and well presented in the book. This framework unifies a whole lot of concepts and approaches in the field of constraint programming.ALL the materials are well articulated and presented. As a newcomer to the field, I could understand all of the concepts step by step (but in a slow manner because you have to think and digest).Why I did not give 5 stars to the book because there is no practical sessions for me to try out different algorithms. But the same author has written another book on using Eclipse (a freeware) to do the constraint programming. If two books can be integrated togather, this will be the best."
4,A whole new way to learn spanish!,"This program takes spanish language learning software to a whole new level. Advanced spanish is an appropriate title for this program since It literally immerses you in the language with an actual spanish soap opera episode. You can practice in a number of ways, as well as take quizzes. Some of the activities include a visually based vocabulary program. In this area of the software the program shows you a still from the movie with an object circled and you name the word in spanish. Others include listening for the missing word in a conversation- harder than it sounds. You can watch the movie with and without spanish subtitles so you can follow along with the script or try to watch it without. Some minor- very minor- technical glitches not really affecting the operation of the program or use of it prevent me from giving this a full 5 stars. But a really great, well rounded buy!"
3,breaks down fast,I wear this one or two times a week and it is already looking beat up. It appeared to be stitched in the picture but it was not.
3,Understand the suffering of many and come to terms with a father's death,"This book is definitely a YA novel because you'll get your fair dose of angst and indecision about life as Danny tries to figure out what in the world he wants out of life. He is reminded by everyone of his noble father's death. He deals with addicts, paranoid old men, and a young single mom who doesn't want a romantic relationship with him. Throughout the story is the question, ""Why did he truly drop out of his prestigous music university?""This story is realistic in that there is no cliched clean-cut ending, but one still filled with unfinished stories and wonderings about the future."
2,Disappointing,"I found ""Now You See Her"" to be a very frustrating book to read. Had it not been the selection of the month for the book club I'm in, I'm sure I would never have finished it. The premise is intriguing: a forty-year old woman begins to actually and figuratively disappear. Unfortunately, the potential of this concept is never reached. Disjointed and confusing, the novel is painfully short on plot and characterization, with little conflict and no resolution. The last section of the book is so bizarrely contrived that you truly feel cheated upon finishing.I gave it two stars instead of one because it did actually lead to an interesting discussion, and occasionally there were moments of insight regarding the role of middle-aged women in American society. But do yourself a favor -- don't read this book unless you intend to talk about it with someone else. You'll need someone to vent with before it's over."
1,Very unhappy!,I did not get what is advertised in the picture. I only received under arm pads. I feel that if this is the only thing they are selling then this is the only item that should be in the picture! I have written twice to the seller to try and fix the situation; however they are either to busy to answer a good customer or simply ignoring me. Which either way does not show good customer service!
3,Cats love it... and then they tear,My cats love it while it lasted. after about 3-4 weeks they ended up tear the streamer out and eating some of them. The product is good but would be better if it wasn't so easy to break.
1,could it get worse?,"ok well yall are losin it cuz teh best ppv of the year so far was either no way out or king of the ring.............the main event was ever so predictable, taker was so easily going to win and last man standing was stupid cuz hhh didn't tap i mean what are they all supermen now woulnd't you like to see some realism n have some1, any1 tap out!"
2,thought it would have more,"I wasnt really impressed with the information it gave, I like a little more detail. Im going to have to invest in the traditional field guide on clouds and weather"
4,Salon-Like Nails At Home!,This is a really great book! It shows some really great tequiniques and designs that take minutes! It also comes with nailpolish in the colors that you need to do most of the designs. All directions are clear and it is very well illustrated! A must buy for young girls who love doing their nails! It's always used at my slumber parties my friends fingers and toes have never been cuter!
2,LIGHTWEIGHT LIGHTNING,"Another one of those made for TV disaster flicks featuring the usual characters and a rather incredulous premise. Seems like a bunch of storms are going to merge together all around the globe and predicate a new ice age. Researcher Joanna Pacula is the only one (naturally) who realizes this and most of the movie is spent with her trying to convince disbelieving faculty members and a stern general. Meanwhile we get another 15 year old genius (Pacula's son) who we know is going to come up with the solution to save the day, but not before the usual family problems, the most serious being the arrival of his real mother. Meanwhile lightning strikes a few buildings and provides about as much suspense as a carousel ride.Moderately diverting but nothing special."
3,not bad for the price,"i got this a month ago.. at a pretty decent price for a 200 pack.have used around 10-15 and all of them have been fine so far.use it in office and at home, and nobody's complained so far.haven't done any audio recording so can't say about that, butdata recording seems good. A fair buy."
2,Tip broke off on first use,"Unfortunately I can't echo the nice comment already here. I did not have good luck with these. I picked up this exact set at a local big box store and had to take it back the next weekend with broken bit. I was drilling in some old pine joists when the tip jammed and broke off - this was within the first 5 mins of use. Nice idea, but didn't work for me."
3,Dark Seed,"Haven't played the first one but the second one is the most f***ed up game I know of. Gigers work is only the beginning. Dead babies one breasted women and decapitated heads are only the beginning. If you think that's cool, this is the game for you."
2,dissapointing,"The title says it all, i recieved the item with high hopes but when I hooked it up only 1 bar worked. To make it clearer this product comes in 2 sections to cover the 28"", and that means half of the distance didn't work. For those who think maybe my pump was the problem it wasn't, i took out the section that worked toleave the 1 bar with all the pressure, and also tried switching which side it was on and still had no luck. And as for their solution of sticking pins in them, well thats alot of holes to make andmaybe i need better ones but they all bent or broke before they made the hole.I gave it 2 stars because the part that does work is quite nice so i don't hate all of it."
2,Disappointed,The bubbles come out super heavy on one side and barely on the other. I have checked the connector piece and have a pump for a 40 gallon tank. That should be plenty big enough to push air through both sides.
2,"Works somewhat, but not good when combining wands","I bought 4 of these to span my 8' tank. My plan was to have a solid bubble wall against the back of my tank. I have a very powerful air pump (meant to supply many tanks for all sorts of things) and no matter what, the bubble wall was incondistent. Some section of the wand worked great, some sections had no bubbles, but the sections after them did, which means the air was getting through.So I wasted allot of money to just used 14"" of these in both corners of the tank. The bubbles are bigger than I wanted too.Overall this is a pretty poor product."
4,cool show,"Arnold&Willis Moving from the Hood to the Burbs.it was a show that truly wasn't like anythign else on Tv at the time. it was a real interesting dynamic for a White cat to Adopt two Brothers&Bring them into His world.the theme ong puts me in the frame of mind of Sly&the Family stone's ""Everyday people"". the cast had real good chemistry. the Show was solid for the first three years."
2,love the producr BUT,"I love my new fingerprint reader keyboard, but I am having problems with the mouse. it keeps locking up on me and I have to unplug it from my computer and replug to get it to work. I have uninstalled and re-installed it. I have went to HP help center and no one can help me fix this problem"
5,GREAT KEYBOARD!,"so far this keyboard has been great and for the current price, i think it was well worth it. the thing i dont like about the product is the corded keyboard, and the limited range that the mouse has, and also it would be nice if the mouse came with more buttons and not the standard two button optical mouse. but besides that everything is great! and the fingerprint reader is incredibly useful! i will comment again if i have any prblems."
4,Not a gimmick - Very useful but some drawbacks,Pros:1) software for fingerprint works flawlessly and VERY robust2) the keyboard is a STANDARD layout unlike many previous ms keyboardsCons:1) the fingerprint pad needs to cleaned (towel + water) REGULARLY or it wont sense your fingerprint anymore2) very poor design in that it takes TWO valuable USB ports when they could have designed it to use one and have the wireless receiver integrated into the keyboard.3) the mouse (Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0) tapers out at the bottom which pushes the pinky finger outwards which makes for a very unergonomical hold on the mouse (at least for me) My old Logitech Click! felt so much better being it tapered in at the bottom.
3,"Works, but slow","Very easy to set up, works well, but does take a while to pull username and password from saved memory. Sometimes up to a minute. Mouse works well."
4,Anything Nanci is great,A good video shot live at Anderson Fair in Houston. It's a bit older but still quite nice. Video is a bit grainey from the low light setting but the audio is good.
4,Good flavor but very crunchy!,"Just received these today and I must say the flavor is pretty good. The only downside is that they are extremely crunchy. I wouldn't have expected soft, chewy cookies but I was a little surprised by how firm they really were. Still, after a couple of cookies I've already started getting used to the texture, and I still say it is worth it to enjoy a suger-free cookie that is relatively guilt-free."
1,Copy Protected,"I'm sitting here at my computer trying to move this CD to my IPOD. I can't. My computer doesn't even recognize that there is an audio disc in. I paid over $300 to see him in concert a couple of years back, not counting purchasing every bit of his back catalog including the Beatles and someone makes a decision which doesn't allow me to put it to my IPOD? Record company (and I am assuming artist) greed. It's a shame. Gonna return this in the morning unlistened to. How Do You Sleep Paul?"
1,The worst Album in along time,"Paul should stop making music, Its bland and Lifeless junk.This is the worst album i have heard from Paul McCartney"
2,Here we go again.....,"Other LPs of McCartney's that belong in a box set; Press to Play, Pipes of Peace, Broadstreet, and now Chaos.... I was SOOOooo Disappointed there were NO McCartney Rockers on this cd, except for Fine Line. I felt that while I was listening to this I should have had a bubble machine plugged in."
3,Running on Fumes,"I put the CD in the player and waited. The high never came The days of Wings and my encounter with the lads from the balcony of the Hammersmith Odeon in 1965 is how I remember Paul.Redemption however is possible. At 56 I am raving to the songs of Simple Plan and Green Day that blast from the bedrooms of my three teenagers. ""Holiday,"" by Green Day should bear the same influence on Paul as Muddy Waters did way back when."
1,Total piffle !,"Lord knows, I love Paul Mccartney & the Beatles. But this latest CD of his is an abomination. If Amazon alowed me to give it no stars whatsoever , that's what my rating would be . I listened to it once & then "" regifted "" it a fellowBeatlemaniac friend in the vain hope he can derive something enjoyable from it.I couldn't. It's a disgrace."
3,Pleasant But Inconsequential,"If you've enjoyed Paul's output over the past ten years and think that it's his best period, than certainly buy this one too. You'll enjoy it.To my taste, aside from ""Fine Line"" and maybe ""Jenny Wren"", it's mostly elevator music with insipid lyrics. Pleasant but inconsequential.I'm looking forward to the remastered ""Concert For Bangladesh"" CD and DVD. That rocks with inspired performances!"
1,Now that he's 64 ... he's still a bore,"Monumental twaddle.How do you sleep ""Teddy Boy""?With your nation (and the world) off the rails, this is the best you could come up with.I would suggest you buy (or borrow) George Harrison's last album and listen to ""Brainwashed"". It might give you some ideas. God knows you need some."
3,"Swing...........and a miss, too bad","How could Paul miss an opportunity like this? With all the hype and the buzz and the super-bowl and the Live 8 and the touring and all the ass-kissing he has gotten in the past 2 - 3 years. Everyone is watching him; he could have won a Grammy or had a number one album. Instead he puts out the least thrilling thing since Off the Ground. Too bad Paul, but I still love ya!"
4,Two Thumbs Up,"I'm a Beatles fanatic, but in no way do I love everything that was put out by each of them after striking it out on their own. This is the first McCartney album I've bought on it's release, so I was eagerly anticipating it, and I wasn't let down one bit. I do understand the complaint that there isn't as many upbeat rockers as there should be, but I appreciate this effort by Paul. Anyone can put out the same record over and over, but a true artist tries to progress, and I believe that's what he's done here. I don't find this album to be dull at all, on the contrary I find it quite interesting. Standouts include Fine Line, Jenny Wren (very reminiscent of Blackbird,) Friends to Go (a tribute to George, probably one of, if not my favorite,) and At The Mercy. This album ranges from the upbeat, to the introspective, all classic Paul. Maybe it's not for everyone, but I think a great portion of those who appreciate Paul as an artist, will appreciate Chaos."
5,Paul McCartney Thinks Outside the Box,"I am certainly a McCartney fan and I follow everything he does. I even found a beautiful contribution he wrote in Stephanie Lerner's poignant book ""Kids Who Think Outside The Box. This album is innovative and creatively McCartney. It's worth buying. He is a living legend."
1,Uninspired and forgetable....,"I was and am a huge Beatle fan. I've bought all of Sir Paul's albums, but this latest offering is nothing but forgetable tunes and uninspired lyrics. His demise as the worlds greatest song writer is sad, but obvious. This ain't no ""Band On The Run""...notice how many used ones are already for sale."
5,Such an enjoyable escape,I have read all of Kate Kingsbury's WW2 series and find them so relaxing and full of the most wonderful escapist writing. This last one maintained the high standard and I look forward to the next
4,Valuable and full of useful content,"I find the book very useful, it is full of practically useful content. Formulas, theorems, lots of examples and illustrations. Overall very easy to read and understand, though requires you to recall your forgotten mathematical skills. The book does present what it claims on the first pages, so read the abstract and judge for yourself if you need the book. For my purposes, I found it to contain all the material I needed to perform certain image photo transformations and compositions. There is also lots of reference material, in terms definitions, formulas and theorems with proofs. And it's good to have it all in one place.Overall I would say it is worth the money."
5,Mini Fan,I'm a new fan of paper pieced miniatures. A friend had this book and loaned it to me. I had to get my own after looking at it. This was such fun and I'm no longer intimidated by miniscule pieces.
5,Great belly chain,"Bought this for the lady, and she absolutely loved it. The look is very nice and it sparkles nicely. It compliments some of her sexier things very nicely. A great accent."
4,Sing & Play Roar Music,I thought it was a reproducible CD but it wasn't but it was still good to have it. Thanks
1,Steer Clear of This One,"""Rhythm Reading"" will not teach you how to read rhythm. It will only give you examples of rhythms you are likely to encounter in western music. The author does state the following: ""It is expected that students using this book will have at least a rudimentary knowledge of music reading."" This is an understatement, you need a strong background in music reading to get any benefit from this book."
4,Gift,This was purchased as a gift and have not really had any feedback from the person I gave it too.............am quite sure she will love it though as it was asked for.
1,CD-DVC Cleaner,Product does not do a proper job of cleaning. Would not recommend. I would recommend a cleaner that also has the liquid cleaner in addition to just the brush.
4,It works good for US products.,"It works good for US products, but I am not sure that it works well for Israelite products. Can you tell it works for Apple Macbook pro or not?"
3,I subscribed through Audubon for $20,"I'm excited to get the magazine, and Amazon usually has a deal on subscriptions, but in this case, it seems best to go to the source. They will reap the benefits of your support and today I joined for a year for only $20."
3,Why this book is different,"(...) Kensington's BRAVA line -- of which this is one (you can tell because her regular books are in (...) mass market format, not the more expensive trade paperback like this one) -- was created specifically for EROTIC romance. If this book lacks the tenderness and intimacy of some of her other books, this is why. The BRAVA books are supposed to find a happy medium between true women's erotica (multiple partners) like the BLACK LACE series of British books, and regular romances where only one partner is allowed.If you don't want to read erotica from Susan Johnson (...) don't read BRAVA. But if you like (...)hot and don't mind sacrificing some of the emotional content to get the punchier love scenes, then you'll like this."
1,Pure Porn,"I used to be a fan of Susan Johnson, but this one has crossed the line into pure porn. There is very little plot and no characterization to support the many very graphic and detailed sex scenes. In fact, once Max and Christina get into the bedchamber, it's as if they're two different people, further straining the credibility of the book. The big problem facing the characters is solved through a rather flimsy, deus-ex-machina type of plot device, but by then you almost don't care. This will be the last Susan Johnson book I buy, especially since I can't put it on my bookshelf--I'd be embarrassed to have someone pick it up and skim through it."
4,Would purchase from them again.,"I purchased this toy so I could mail it out to my niece for her second birthday. I was very happy that it came right on time, and was the correct toy. I had no problems at all with this seller. Oh, and the puzzle was the size of a grown up's hand. Nice chunky pieces for toddlers. Made of wood, but no splintery parts to it."
3,While I simply love the series....,"I almost feel that E. Haydon lost a bit of steam on this one. I mean, it's worth reading just to get through the rest of the series, but it's like she's kind of lost grip on the personalities of Grunthor and Achmed. And Ashe, even. They all kind of wind up like Rhapsody in their mannerisms.And there's a lot of... whiney, poor me angst. Though as always lots of action. Just... not quite as well portrayed as it was in the first three books.Now, when you get to the bad guys and the new characters, they're a bit better! Wait 'til you meet Faron. Poor Faron!Her first three books were absolutely wonderful reads. This was flatter. Though definetly finish the series! Next book onwards was a tad better and I can't wait for the end :)"
4,Breath Catcher,"The story was great! Elizabeth Haydon pulls you farther into Rhapsody's story(past and present). It re-introduces her old tormentor, Michael, with a great twist. You will find yourself holding your breath, wondering what will happen next. Though it lags in some places, I would recommend this to any fantasy reader."
4,stainless steel compost keeper good size,"Upgrading from plastic to stainless steel is a good choice for keeping compost on a kitchen countertop. Very easy to clean, less smells. This pail is slightly larger than most available in this price range which makes it more useful without giving up space. However, we were very disappointed that the lid is too snug to actual use in the closed position for daily inside use. In order not to have to use 2 hands to open it [one pulling up on the lid and one holding the side knob] I have to keep it tilted open [most inside use requires being able to just pull off the top with one hand because the other is full of veggie scraps] - The snug lid is useful for while making the trip to the back yard compost bin when it is completely full."
3,Small but annoying design flaw,"This works well, except for one sizable design flaw-- the lid gets stuck-- and comes apart. The last thing you want when dealing with your grungy compost bucket is to have to use your fingers to pry the lid out. Other than that? It's a bucket. It does that job fine. (and it seems to contain the odors well)."
3,disappointed,Like the composter but have trouble with the lid. At first it was too tight then it cracked around the rim. Don't know if ours was just defective but it makes it impossible to close the lid. Also wish I had chosen the one with ridges instead of the smooth finish. It is OK but requires more upkeep.
4,a book for intermediate learners,"I have been living in a Vietnamese house-hold for two years now (I rent from Vietnamese people) and I have been to Vietnam two times. I had long learned the ""basic"" grammer structure and many useful words before I bought this book. The book _can_ be used for newbies, but I would not advise it. It is basically a crash-course in Vietnamese, cramming in valuable lessons at every-interval and leaving out some explainations that a person totally unfamiliar with vietnamese would find hard to grasp. This is a perfect book for a transition from a begginer to an intermediate student. For a Total beginner I would say it is not the book. I also did not find anything especially intriguing about the cultural notes. But if you can rememeber a lot of information really quickly, it is possible to read the entire book in about 4 hours."
1,Teach Youself Vietnamese,"I found this book very frustrating to use. The vocabulary was not reviewed prior to the very quick paced converstions, so it was hard to work on proper pronunciation. The chapters did not have very practical topics (You are a secretary, aren't you?, Do you want to see a photograph of my family?, Do you still work in a hotel? Do you still have a temperature?). I found Vietnamese for Beginners by Jake Catlett and Huong Nguyen to be much more worthwhile. It has a lot of practical vocabulary which is slowly pronounced prior to the conversations. In addition, the chapters teach things I can actually see myself needing to know (Greetings, yes/no questions, common nouns, countries, action verbs, days of the week/month/year, food/drink, time, daily habits, clothing, colors,etc.)when we visit the country."
4,Audio needs improvement,"Like another reviewer said, teaching tones needs more attention and practice, especially in contrasting them. I am not complaining about the audio amount in the main text but it would be advisable to have it clearer, slower and with pauses between phrases, even if Vietnamese people speak faster naturally. Alternatively, recording in 2 speeds could be provided - slow and natural. Individual vocabulary words could be read as well. As for the text, vocabulary choice and exercises, they are not bad and manageable, not always spoon-fed but the words can be found in the provided glossary. For any serious learner, a dictionary is a must, so... I give it 4 points for some flaws with audio. Perhaps, having Southern accent example would be good but this may only confuse some learners, taking into account the difficulty of the accent."
4,Nice to see that the truth is out there !,"Put in short : I teach aerodynamics, ATPL level, at the Norwegian Aviation College, and it is a shame that this is about the only book available, that manages to explain the basics in aerodynamics without lying to the students.My wish is that the author writes a new book, covering aspects of super sonic flight as well. And perhaps adding a little information on power / thrust curves etc. This would allow people to use it in their preparations during flight school."
1,This book is based on false premises.,"The concepts taught in this book are wrong. Wind tunnel data demonstrate that the physical mechanisms responsible for the generation of lift as proposed in this book are not correct. In this book, assumptions are made in mathematical manipulations, but then the results are applied generally not accounting for the crippling assumptions. Many of the assumptions made in the starting premises of this book are faulty and thus subsequent developments are invalid. The derivation of the lift equation given in this book depends on the physical and mathematical naiveness of its audience in order to get an accepted form of the lift equation from false premises. If you want a true understanding of what makes airplanes fly, I do not recommend this book."
3,decent,"It is decent. I teaches you the basics of Danish vocabulary, but does not go much beyond that. It is good if you just want a couple of words to randomnly blurt out in Denmark."
2,Horrible packaging! Not worth the money.,"For a couple dollars more plus gas I should have heeded the previous buyer warnings here and just gotten off my lazy butt to the nearest supply store to buy something similar in person. These cases arrived so poorly wrapped that little bits of black plastic were already rattling around in the box before I took them out. I ordered two packages and one of them had scotch tape all over it, as though someone had tried to tape the flimsy plastic wrap back around the package. From a total order of 50, 32 of them were broken and unusable. What a waste of money and plastic!!!"
2,Misleading title and cover photo,"Don't buy this book if you're looking for descriptions of combat in Vietnam, tales of camaraderie, proof that human spirit can triumph over horror, or incredible hardship overcome with dignity. This book is more suited for people looking for repeated whiny, moaning tantrums versus authority, the type that teenagers love to see (and perpetrate). In large groups of people, you can usually run across a perpetual complainer, and that seems to be what the author's attitude is towards his various superiors in Vietnam. I'm not denying that some or all were incompetent; it's just that it gets tiring to hear his rebellious attitude towards them. There are other books written about Vietnam, where the authors faced bigger problems than clueless superiors with, as I said, dignity, a sense of humour, faith... There are many other Vietnam books out there that are much better than this one."
5,Good Product,"I've been using mine for almost a month now. I am satisfied with my purchase but it has some drawbacks you might want to consider. Happy shopping! :)Pros:-Case is slim (without clip attachment)-Completely protects phone without covering buttons, camera, ports-Only case I could find to fit my new phoneCons:-A bit awkward to hold with clip attachment (but I got used to it)-Snaps on back that connect the case scratch easily (black paint on metal)-Border around the clear plastic part obscures the ""done"" and ""cancel"" buttons at the bottom of the screen, leaving you to squint or guess at your choice until you memorize the menus"
1,Terrible!!! Problem after problem!!!,"This was unfortunately the first DVD+R I tried when I bought my new CPU with DVD burner. I tried to burn video three times and three times it was a complete failure. The video would stall out, start and stop, or break up. One of the discs wouldn't even load and the DVD player gave me an error message. I figured it was the DVD writing software I was using so I gave the company a call... To make a long story short, I was advised to try another type of disc. It worked with the new type of disc (a Pengo DVD+R) and the recording played beautifully. To make absolutely sure of the horrible quality of this product before writing this review, I tried to record yet another time. The final attempt wouldn't load either. I definitely wouldn't take a chance on this product working for you. I'm 0 for 4."
4,"Excellent, Fun, Reflective","Lead one of those too-busy lives? Love those moments when you stop to feel the gratitude for life, to let the wonder of the moment sink into your soul? This well-written, very simple and profound book reminds us to do just that. Written with joy and wisdom, the book covers strategies for reconnecting to our intuition and enhancing our mind-body connection. After reading this book, I started a file of compliments people give me, to remind myself that I do good things. Somehow we are too often too hard on ourselves. It's a very easy and pleasurable read, and I recommend it highly."
3,Ape Case,"I would have preferred a case more like a suitcase. I don't like deep bags that open at the top and you have to rummage around to find what you need on the bottom.Unfortunately,I guess that everyone else likes the deep sack type of case or the manufacturers think that this style is what we want ??"
5,Ape Case Pro,"Great Digital Camera Bag! Love the bright yellow interior, it makes finding things easy. Has plenty of room and pockets and zip pouches. The only drawback I have is the extra side clasps that seem to be a nuisance. They can be removed and therefore I still think for the money this is the best case out there."
2,overall not good,"The book was supposed to be listed as 'good' quality when really it is in terribly poor condition. There are coffee stains throughout the book, torn pages, and the binding is completely ruined. They shouldn't sell books this crappy and disgusting and if they do they should most definately say that it is in poor condition."
4,Not for the uninitiated,"This is a good book if you already have a foundation in genetics. Oddly, the book is marketed as your basic undergrad genetics text. Yet instead of just explaining the concepts, it leads you on the path of discovery of how researchers figured all this stuff out. If you are still learning the subject, you may do better with Klug/Cummings/Spencer. If you are going into higher levels of biology and want to learn some research methods, this is a good book."
3,A coffee table Beer Book,"This is not the most informative book, but it is interesting in that it contains recipes that are touted as being able to pass as famous commercial brands.I would use this book as a stocking stuffer for the brewer in your life. Its a light read, and might be lost on a beginning brewer who is more concerned with learning the brewing process."
2,Auf Last Geht's Los [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] [IMPORT],Auf Last Geht's Los [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] [IMPORT]
1,Poor quality all around,"Upon receipt I washed these sheets - as instructed.They came out of the dryer badly faded, especially in the crease marks which are now quite visible. There are bleed patterns in the stripes, worn spots and the hemming is quite shabby. They look like they are years old and I just bought them.Very disappointed. Save your money."
2,Not Great.,"I bought a set of these in the Twin Xl size a couple of years ago. They have recently become so threadbare and worn that holes have appeared. This isn't really a complaint because at 200 thread count I didn't expect them to last forever, it's just a heads up to let you know how long you can expect them to last. The color on these sheets began to fade almost immediately and now I think there is more blue dye that has bled into my mattress pad than still remains in the sheets themselves. The Twin XL sheets are a very tight fit as well, I have found myself checking the tag many times to make sure I didn't order regular twin sheets by mistake. The one and only good thing I can say about this sheet set is that it looks cool, for a little while anyway, once the color starts to go they mostly just look gross."
5,great book!,Mark Rashid has once again written a wonderful book. Easy to read and full of interesting tips and guidance not only for horsemanship but that apply to all aspects of life. this book really defines his style and philosophy.
4,Common Sense Equals Success,"I was introduced to Mark's works several years ago by a friend who said our lives were very similiar. I have read all of Mark's books and highly recommend them. As I found out, Mark's writing is simple in it's common sense approach for achievement, will more than likely stimulate your memory for pleasurable moments, and put quite a few smiles on your face as you read. You will learn a lot about horses, a lot about life and a major key ingredient for success in both: Patience. Patience breeds success and I doubt there are many, if any, horseman with more patience than Mark. I recommend Kathleen Lindley's book ""In the Company of Horses"" as well."
5,Great Little Piece,"Although slightly tricky to put together this is a great little piece. It is sturdy, well made and nicely finished. I don't have enough space for a home office, or a regular file cabinet (which look so austere and clunky anyhow), so this doubles as an end table in my [modern style] living room. It looks really sharp, and it's ability to roll around easily, as well as serve multiple purposes, makes it a great storage piece for either students or households short on space."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!,"Only good thing i can say is that it arrived early, other than that - absolutely awful - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM - unpacked and most of the parts were marked ordented - unable to put together due to damage and it was not shipping damage either - someone ACTUALLY packed it like that - called their customer service which sounded like it was a guy working out of his home - he said he'd send replacement parts - which he did about 2 weeks later - got those and THEY WERE DAMAGED beyond use too - I mean WTF??? Ended up calling Amazon and sent it back - terrible product - terrible Innovex customer service - Amazon was great with refund though."
2,disappointed in New Hampshire,You get what you pay for and it wasn't worth a $100.00. For a couple bucks more I could have bought a quality HON steel cabinet.
5,Why Isn't Law A Household Name,"This book brought to life in vivid fashion one of the most interesting and influential individuals in history. I found the book to provide a balanced account of his life, his pros and cons, his contributions and mistakes (without moralizing). One comes away with an amazing flavor for what life was like during John Law's life, socially and politically. Finally, this is an important chapter in the development of Western capitalism it was a pleasure to have the story so well told."
3,Interesting Subject,"I don't know what it was about this book but I found it difficult to get deeply involved with - I really enjoyed ""The Professor and The Madman"" but I found this more difficult to engage."
2,Looks good but.......wobbble,"i bought a set Nov'07 nice black ones. great riding in the beginning for about 2 months - suddenly developed a wobble in the back wheel (i live in the desert with no hills, straigt roads and no potholes where i go in Qatar). took it to the local bike shop to get straitened, maybe to be expected from new wheels because it needs to be broken-/ridden in. got it corrected but lasts only a week, had to go back to mechanic. after many many trips to the mechanic they found one nipple were stripped and replaced it. the wheel were never the same after this, now after every trip about half of the spokes are loose, get it tightened again and off i go. now how do you explain this after spending so much money. i called the shop i purchased it from in Orlando but no reply or help. the 2 stars is for the front wheel with no problems"
5,One Great Book,"This author does a fabulous job of conveying the main character's madness in a way that comes across as a dream sequence. One seldom finds an author who can write a well-rounded story that truly involves the reader. By the end of the book, Agnes comes shining through -- with all her shortcomings. Read this book! ""...a woman scorned..."""
5,works great!,It arrived on time. And it really works.. four days I did it and already had received compliments on losing weight. You just have to be consistent.
1,Wake Up People Kim just wants to Make Money out of Ya,"Everybody knows that black makes you look thinner and hides a lot of imperfections. The person who deserves credit on her DVD is the lady teaching her how to do that stuff anyways. They should call the DVD ""Watch me workout with my personal trainer"". I also think that it was an insult to true fitness women out there to not be featured on this month's muscle fitness hers and have Kim Kardashian on the cover instead. I am wondering how much she paid for that one.She is beautiful, and because of her family background that is why she looks like she does but PLEEEASE, Kim is no fitness expert and needs to wise up when it comes to men.Save your money"
2,Too many critics,"Critics all said this book was a great debut. This book was full of let downs. The author has a lot of talent, which is evident in his ability to show rather than tell. However, the plot was ""like"" Ralph Ellison only because the Kulam is trying to be Ellison. The plot was full of build-ups with no real climaxes in my opinion. It even smelled like Invisible Man without the real big climaxes and social commentary. I just can't say I enjoyed reading this book."
4,attractive storage but not recommended for laundry,"I bought these baskets to create a laundry system, but after a few weeks they developed mold when stored in my basement, so now I will use them as trash cans. I found the mold at the bottom of the baskets and the bottom of the liners. The last laundry basket I had was also wicker and I threw it away because of mold, but that one was unfinished and I thought the finishing on these baskets would protect them but it didn't. Also, I had placed a nylon bag on top of the liner to prevent mold, but even two layers of liners was not enough to prevent the mold from appearing.I suppose the baskets can be used as laundry baskets if they are lined with a plastic bag to prevent mold. They are attractive with a dark gold finish and fine wicker work, but the handles are delicate and easily crushed. The liner is off-white with navy stripes. The approximate sizes are: large 0 23"" high, medium - 19"" high, and small - 15"" high."
2,MORE CAROL MOORE!,"When the first boost for this book appeared in the Chicago Tribune, it was stated that this was the first of a planned three books on the adventures of ""Carol Moore,"" the name of Murphy's narrator/heroine.I would imagine the publisher backed off when the same newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, published an article noting that the named reviewers in the amazon.com site were friends of the author, Patrick Murphy. One amazon.com review that seems to have gone missing was the rave submitted by one Eileen Donnersberger, a woman who didn't think worth mentioning that she is the sister of author, Patrick Murphy."
3,gift,I bought this for my grandson who is 7 years old. He has not use it yet for he had so many other things to build. I'm sure he will love it.
4,Super Bowl Sunday: The Day American Stops.,"The good things about this book that make it unique are that you get to hear the points of view of important people in Super Bowl history that you normally do not get to hear from. (linemen, non-superstar players, team executives) Their unique perspectives on the biggest of all football games makes this book stand apart from the typical Super Bowl book.The negatives are that for the money, the book is too short. There are a couple of factual errors, as well as printing errors, where the same paragraphs and pages are accidentally repeated. (Did anyone at the publisher bother to proofread it first?)For the true football/Super Bowl fan, you will find this book enjoyable."
5,Impressive,"I really like this set. The size, almost 2 feet and weight around 5lbs may make it harder to play with for a kid, but I love it. I took the liberty of adding a lot more guns to it. The look of this model is very imposing and the interior offers a modest amount of things to do. I also found the durability was greatly increased when I filled in the bottom of the ship with the biggest flat pieces I could fit. This of course is only an option for those who have a bunch of legos from their childhood like I do. If you want it to stay together well,firmly press all pieces together as you go and use two hands to hold it!"
5,The funniest show ever!,"You just have to watch it to get it. My all time favorite, I can watch it over and over. Can't wait for the movie!"
5,Hilarious show!,"I just picked this ""box"" set up a couple weeks ago, and though I have seen every episode before, it is still great to watch. I do recommend watching it from the beginning because every episode links together, and if you start off later on you wouldn't be able to understand some of the references."
5,arrested development complete series,this product came very quickly and i am very satisfied with the quality. thank you very much for the wonderful service.
5,Better than I expected,"I'm a big fan of quirky shows (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, 30 Rock, etc.), but this is even better than I expected. I had seen a few episodes over the years, but seeing them in order is outstanding. The best is that there is some momentum that builds from watching several in a row.This is the best deal going. Getting the whole series for less than the price of two seasons individually is a steal."
5,I've Made A Huge Mistake,"It took me a while to get off my duff and buy these DVDs, and luckily, an Amazon gift card from a friend made that possible. I love shows like Fawlty Towers, Peep Show, The Office (British & American), Mr. Show, Tim And Eric's Awesome Show Great Job, Curb Your Enthusiasm, etc., and this is one of the best, in my opinion. The jokes are layered, oftentimes subtle, and can take episodes or whole seasons to unfold. In a world littered with the likes of Mad TV, Frank TV, and Dane Cook, it is a pleasure to watch a show that cherishes and acknowledges the viewer's intelligence, instead of insulting it. It was too beautiful to live past three seasons. A damn shame."
5,most underrated show of this decade,"this show has to be one of the most underrated shows of this decade. full of laughs and witty comedy that ranks up there with the best of the best. too bad FX doesn't know a good show when they have one.if you are a fan of intelligent & witty sitcoms, this is one for you. put this in your collection and you will not be sorry"
5,it's a crime this show got cancelled,"This is show is one of the best-written in a while. It's got a great plot and its characters are well-developed while being unbelievably hysterical. theyre hilarious and so is the show. its great, and its a type of humor that everyone can find funny. too bad like most good shows it got cancelled"
5,Something for Everybody,"Arrested Development, although no longer on TV networks, lives on with great frivolity in a home near you. What makes Arrested Development amazing are the dynamics between so many seemingly dissident family members who can at the same time, leave no doubt in your mind that they are quite complimentary. Every viewer can find parts of himself or herself in the characters on the show. Soon, the inside jokes in the series will become inside jokes for you and your friends too.The more you watch Arrested Development, the more you will enjoy it because there are great nuances and amazing situational comedy supplemented by a cast of loonies and jokesters. You may even wish that you grew up a Bluth! Well, probably not."
4,Understated humor,"Had never heard of this series when I made the purchase. No regrets. The humor is pretty clean and albeit subtle, really quite hilarious. You can't help feeling empathy for Michael (Jason Bateman) who seems to be the lone shred of sanity amidst his completely cuckoo family."
3,"Uneven, but funny for the most part.","Season one did not disappoint at all, it was just as advertised. Although I have to qualify because I have not completed season 2 yet, the quality went down significantly (so far). There are a lot of repetitive jokes that are not funny, although Tobias in the Blue Man Group is comedy gold. Season 3 (a short one) hinted of desperation because the writers knew they were going to be cancelled. Thus, there were a lot of jokes referring to that."
4,great bargain,I got this as a gift for my husband. It was a great deal as i got all 3 seasons for the price of 1 1/2. very funny series
3,"Depressing, as expected","I saw David at Cornerstone Fest this summer and he was good. He sand mainly slow, depressing, acustic songs. But I like alot of them. I couldn't find any of his merch so I waited till I got home. This is the only solo recording I found of his. It's really only 5 songs, and then 5 acustic versions of the same songs. The sonfs are creative and yes, in the vein of Pedro The Lion. There is a 'band', but I think It's all Bazan. If you aren't familiar with Bazan's lyrics, you should be. Some colourful language does make an appeareance again. If you area die hard Bazan/ Pedro fan, go for it. Otherwise, at least look up the lyrics first. Lyrics may confuse you as to his'spiritual views' or 'spiritual life' or whatever. Theres some good ideas here, but not a lot of uplifing moments."
2,Not PKD at his best,"I concur with the review already posted. This is not Dick's best work. Having read the collected works out of order, I was shocked to go from #1 to #5 and see the difference. #1 blinded me with it's brilliance, #5 stunned me with it's contrived, inane stores. There is a reason many of them had remained unpublished.As a hard core fan, I am glad I read this volume, and enjoyed a few stories, such as ""The Little Black Box"", ""Precious Artifact"" and ""The Alien Mind""."
2,not steel,The part is the right size but is inferior to the original. It is made of thin aluminum instead of a thicker gauge steel
3,Indoor quality is disappointing,"The Sharp VLZ3u works fine outdoor, but it is disappointing for indoor use. The small size is the only reason that I am keeping it."
2,Disapointing,"My guess is these two handsome guys were considered promotable by the record company. Their arrangements are uninspired and the whole thing never comes off. Their choice of songs is poor. What the devil are things like ""The Wedding March"" doing on this CD?"
2,A little too racy.,"Most Lynn Kurland books are clean and we like this, but this one was a little too explicit in the descriptions"
1,terrible,"I have 4 of these 615's that are good for nothing. All 4 of them came from printers and just stopped working one day (separately). They wouldn't even show up in the printer menus as an installed device. Unfortunately, they were out of warranty - new ones were the fix... DON'T get the 615's - they probably won't last.<edit>Yes - It's the card that failed. When I put the card into another printer, the card(s) still wouldn't show. When I put a known working card into the original printer(s) - the printer works again..."
3,Rather cheesy,"The idea behind this book was good. However, the author does very little to develop the plotlines. In so many cases, she throws the idea out there and then leaves it. Angela is said to be a lesbian, but that never affects her or her life. The nun is a Net-porn fan, but that issue never comes into play.A decent read if you all you want is an escapist book. Otherwise, leave it on the shelf"
3,"Learn to Run Before You Can Walk with Giancoli's ""Physics"" . . .","While I wouldn't call this a bad book, I find myself rather frustrated with it. It seems to me to be most ideally suited for those who either have a natural inclination for physics or those who have plenty of spare time in which to contemplate solutions for the problems. (Unfortunately, I have neither.) The chapters themselves are actually fairly well done, but, in my opinion, not well enough to provide all the necessary information and insights to successfully solve the problems. I've opted to discontinue my attempts to work through this book in favor of Cutnell and Johnson's text of the same title."
1,dont ever buy from this seller!!!!,"i tried to buy the physics 6th edition book, and it turns out she doesnt even have it, now im stuck with her book in my cart, and it keeps saying that the book is going to ship, but it hasnt in about a month, i dont even want it anymore, i bought from someone else, im just writing this review to warn all you people who do not know this person. DO NOT EVER BUY FROM HER, SHE IS A SCAMMER!!!"
2,Book not in condition stated,"Description says book was in good condition but when I received it, the back of the book was ripped. Book also look worn out. Was generally disapointed with my purchase from buyer. Buyer should be more descriotive of item sold in the future."
4,Pretty good replacement for the Marathon 100,"My husband got a Marathon 100 watch when he was 18 and it lasted 24 years. He likes the Atlantis 100, except that the alarm isn't as nice as the old watch, which played a tune. This one just beeps."
2,(...),"(...)She talks about how modern medicine doesn't treat women properly, then she dispenses a variety of synthetic hormones instead of using natural preparations that are compounded for the individual. The side affect of those synthetic hormones is...you guessed it... weight gain. I'm actually up 5 pounds thanks to the 5 different birth control pills she placed me on. (...)"
4,Book well done.,"Very well detailed history lesson. The Lincoln highway is coast to coast, San Francisco to New York and I am planning on taking this route and route 66 to and from Sacramento on one round trip. The author obviously spent a great deal of time on the details and made the trip himself. It was published in 1988 and all photo's are in black and white some dating back to 1915.The only issue I had, was I bought it used through an Amazon third party and I feel my book was maybe mis classified as far as condition by the bookseller. It had a page or two ripped out and was a library book. Bookseller had very good ratings so possibly this just slipped by. Since I am just using it for my own research I will keep it. You get what you pay for, usually and in this case I did. If it was a gift for someone I would have bought new."
3,Incredibly Long...and Detailed...,"Okay, so this wasn't as boring as Eragon(perhaps worst written book I've read in a long time, but I digress), and it was certainly well- written....but all in all I'd say it was just plain long. You will get a good feel for the hardships these poor people faced, but sheesh, they didn't get to America for how many pgs???As for overdetailing things, you'll prob know the character's middle names, favorite food, and birthmarks by the end."
1,Where Are All the UFO's,"I love documentaries about ufos but this one seemed to presented from a skeptics point of view. The film asks the question ""where are all the ufos""?... as if they are no longer around. There are more sightings now than ever before so as a fan of these films I would'nt spend the money. There are much better documentaries about this subject out there."
3,just ok.,Just skip this blue and stay with clear. You will be happier. Here are eight more words to complete this.
5,WOW!!,"Being new to the world of digital video cameras, I can only say that I am very happy with this camera. Although it is packed with features that you can adjust manually, I found the automatic focus, light adjustment, etc., are extremely good. The zoom, even without digital enhancement, is powerful and fast. Playback is clear and easy to control. The size is perfect -- very small, very light. Good battery life. It works very well under low-light conditions. The only drawback is that it does not come with a cable to connect it to your computer (it will connect with Fire-Wire). It does come with the cable to hook it to your VCR or TV. One feature that a friend commented on was the view-screen that folds in, reducing the finger-prints on the screen (his screen in on the back of his camera). We all love this camera -- it is simple and seems pretty [easy to operate]."
4,"Wasn't exactly what I wanted, but definitely a keeper!","The book has interesting, useful information. Not only does the author tell you what ingredients to use for certain types of skin but also why. She even gives short history lessons on the properties of the ingredients. I wanted more information as far as shelf life for the preparations and gift giving ideas as there are some of these you cannot package and mail, but I feel I have a good book nonetheless. Even reading the book relaxed me."
2,"An Extremely Biased, Tendentious Book","This book was written during the middle of the wars between two opposing schools of thought on the Scots-Irish: the Ancestor Worshippers, who thought the Scots-Irish were primarily of Scottish origin and could do no wrong, and the Irish Catholic Historians, who had the exact same viewpoint except they believed just as strongly in an Irish origin and denied the existence of any such group as the ""Scotch-Irish."" Maude Glasgow was about as belligerent in this debate as you could possible get, and was a fierce Ancestor Worshipper Historian. She is usually quoted today as an example of how vehement and biased authors of Scots-Irish books once were."
3,Laptop Bag,"nice,comfort bag.big enough to fit my laptop.but less compartments to store my books and theres a pad which i think its unnecessary. Overall,ideal for travelers."
3,ONE good movie,"Dragonheart is a great movie. Without the second movie, this review would've been a 5. I would rather have spent more money to just get Dragonheart alone, without the second one, than getting them both for such a great deal. The second Dragonheart was too stupid for adults, and too boring for little kids--it was complete crap."
1,GemTwist #1,"Im very unhappy. When i bought this book, it was suppose to be new. they sent me a used book, it even has writing in it :( One never knows, what one will get, even on Amazon."
3,fender tuner,"I've had this tuner for about a year and the pros are, quick, accurate, and easy to read. Cons, noisy. Thank goodness for true bypass. I only turn it on when I need to tune.You get what you pay for. It's worth the price."
2,Not as pictured,"This harness is not for Libertys which don't have a factory tow package (most do not), and does not look like the one pictured here. Most likely, you need the 30085 harness which plugs in at the tail light plugs. It is more expensive, but installs easily. For some reason they pictured the 30085 harness with this model."
4,Smooth skin...,"This polishing towel is great. There hard to find outside of the internet I've found over the last few years. My friend whose from Hawaii introduced me to polishing towels and there great. Increases the overall health and appearance of your skin. I have follicle bumps on my forearm, and the towel clears that right up. Worth trying...you'll be hooked! Don't use daily if you have dry or sensitive skin, because it can dry out your skin. Use a good moisturizer with the towel is my only recommendation."
4,Jillian's Yoga,This is not your traditional Yoga tape. It moves rapidly from one movement to the next. I think this tape is for advanced Yoga devotees or advanced people physically. Still trying to work on most of the moves.
2,Um.?,"Bought it a week ago and tried it out three times. Does not work well with me. the nonexistent-proper alignment and hurtful reps in yoga does not mesh with me. If you want a good yoga video, wait until Exhale Core Fusion Energy Flow comes out or take an online class over at yogavibes for Core Fusion Yoga and you will feel the power & burn of a true Vinyasa Flow. I like her other Dvds 30 Day shred & Boost Metabolism, but not this one guys. If anyone else likes it, more power to you. :)"
3,not as good as her other workouts,"I was expecting a full on yoga work out. It is really not that at all. Jillian's other dvd's are great, but this one I would pass on. If you want a great yoga workout, use Tony Horton's not this one. But for everything else Jillian's 30 minute workouts are great."
5,Killer new Yoga DVD!,"I love Yoga and have been doing it for over 5 years. This DVD is a fresh new take on Yoga. She uses circuit training which makes your heart rate go up and down, has some yoga experts on the DVD, and it has 2 levels. It's great to see such a new way to do yoga! Get yourself a copy, you won't be disappointed."
5,This workout is no joke,"Jillian means business with this one people. There is no OM happening in this dvd. She kicks your butt - hard! I am pretty good at yoga so I jumped right to level 2 and got a great workout. Another thing that is great about this workout is that you don't need any equipment to do it. No dumbbells, steps, or other stuff so it's perfect to take with me when traveling as well."
4,"Great Core Workout ~ Yoga, ""Hmmm, not so much""","I have most of Jillian's workouts as I find them very effective. I decided to give this a try because I was looking for a Yoga DVD to do on Saturday's to balance the other 5 days I workout at a higher intensity. This is a great, challenging workout if you are looking for total body, core conditioning. If you are looking for a ""traditional"" Yoga workout, then this is not it. The pace and the exercises are more difficult than traditional yoga workouts. I love it though, because it is a great total body, conditioning workout."
5,"Just like the Shred, but with yoga!","I own pretty much every Jillian DVD, and the Shred is my favorite. This is my second favorite now because it's set up similar to the Shred. It's short but still a good workout."
5,I LOVE JILLIAN!,"I love JM workouts. She truly is America's toughest trainer. This yoga workout is not easy and she puts strong movements into the poses. She says it herself on the video, that she fell in love with the yoga practice and wanted to get a dvd out there for those getting into the practice. So,this is a BEGINNERS dvd and not a yoga-master-guru dvd, but you do feel the pain in the workout and hopefully the results will come through; I've only worked on this video for 3 days now, but everytime I do it, I do feel the pain that goes with the results oriented workouts."
4,Great workout,"Definitely not for yoga newbies, but this is a sweat-inducing workout. You'll be panting by the end of it, whether from trying to do the moves, or successfully making it through them all. I definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to build strength. I noticed a significant change. After two weeks, I could actually do push ups!"
3,It's alright,"I wasn't expecting yoga to be hard, but when i tried this it was actually pretty difficult. But then again i'm just a beginner! Over all, it's really a great workout!"
3,Pretty good for light days,"Body weight training and yoga poses while moving at a faster pace than traditional yoga. Pretty good on days when you are up for a ligher workout.Jillian can get a little annoying, but I look past that and concentrate on the workout."
3,Ok but not my kind of yoga,"I like Jillian but I'm not really feeling this yoga workout. First, each workout is only 30 minutes long....too short! Second, it doesn't really follow a vinyasa flow or bikram flow. The flow of positions is rather random...and I don't like the repetition of positions which are supposedly meant to up the burn. For the price, it's not worth returning, so I'll just give it away."
1,trouble,"My orden about jillian michaels: yoga meltdown, never arrive to me..... what happen with this?. i dont know the item because I continue waiting for that..."
3,Tried something new...,"FIRST yoga experience. Got this and Bob Harper's Biggest Loser Yoga. Tried this one first. Got through Level 1 and decided to move forward with Level 2. Cannot do major poses like the Crow and the full back bend...I sweated, didn't expect to, but I did. I loved whenever there were strength movements. Hmmm, not my thing though...I am proud of myself for finally trying out yoga/something new...but I am not dying to do it again. I do however LOVE her No More Trouble Zones, Six Week Six Pack, and tried Shred it with Weights/Kettlebells the other day which I totally ENJOYED. I guess I'm more of a strength training kind of gal. I'll try out Bob's Yoga this week, just to try yoga one more time, plus couple reviewers here recommended them as another option...but this one...not sure if I'm doing again. Mixed feelings."
3,"Not to Bad, Not to Good!","I bought this Dvd a while ago and I've gotta say It's quite a workout! However, If you don't have strong arms and hands you can easily hurt yourself, Like I did! This DVD won't give you the benefits of yoga poses, but eventually it'll make you loose some weight!So, If you're looking for a yoga DVD, this is definitely not it! but if your looking for a workout that has a spice of yoga, You might wanna consider this one!...And again, you just wanna be careful about not hurting yourself!!"
4,"""Get comfortable with being uncomfortable!"" (J Michaels)","I have taken part in a number of exercise DVDs, and this is the first one that I have truly enjoyed since Tae-Bo. Although she makes it tough by making me laugh a few times, the comedic relief was kind of nice. I can't wait to continue with the practice! Thanks Jillian!"
3,Yoga Hybrid,"I think this is a good yoga video for those who want a yoga hybrid that uses yoga poses and wants a little faster moving yoga to get the heart rate up. However, I found that even the advanced 30 minute section did not eleveate my heart that much except for a few exercises and I am 62. I was hoping it would be more aerobic. I think Rodney Yee's Power Yoga elevates the heart more. One other concern I have is that the repetive motions used in this video to get the heart rate up, run the risk of hurting the novice. I am not a yoga novice and my back was a little sore because Ms. Jillian had me doing twisting motions repeately and quickly and that is not good form. I wish there was a yoga video that really elevated the heart and didn't threaten your back. Good video but not for yoga novices."
3,Causes back pain,"I have a bunch of her stuff. The new shed and shred is easy in case you are wondering. Fun but easy. I like yoga, but this one murders my back. I'm a trainer and an instructor of just about everything, so I'm fit and I know how to move properly, but there is something about the movements if you get into it and go all out that seriously hurt. If you have a strong back this will most likely be fine. If you don't be very cautious when you start so you don't hurt :)"
4,Not a Yoga workout,"I love Power yoga, yogaerobics, yogalates and have been doing them for years. This DVD is none of these. It is an aerobic routine using yoga poses. I do not get the ""lengthening"" in my muscles that I am used to. It is however a great strength and aerobic workout.With that said, I love it! It is a nice change of pace and easy to jump into because I already know the poses. If you don't know the poses, and know then by name, you are going to have trouble following because there is no instruction in how to do each pose. The only qualm I have with it is Julian talks way too much and I find her irritating."
1,Bad Product,"This product was aweful for me., not only it made my scalp itch like crazy but it made my hair fall out even faster !! I wouldnt recommed this product to anyone."
4,This stuff works! But it takes time.,"I started using this product 2 years ago and have noticed my hair is thicker and stronger. You have to use it faithfully as the directions say and be patient. My hair was just starting to get thin so if you have really thin hair this might not be the answer.If you've noticed some thinning and want it to stop, this stuff's for you. It's a great price too."
2,Not for me,"I have thinning hair and was hoping to stop that process with this, however it is just to cumbersome a process. It took me about 10 minutes to run through the process as quick as possible in my morning routine, and another 15 at night when taking my time.The stuff is very runny...something like the consistency of warm syrup and while it doesn't sound like a lot, 1mL is difficult to spread around, drips down the side of my face happened quite a bit (any missed drip lines turn a nice opaque white stream down your cheek)It also has an unfortunate residue, much like a light hair spray. For someone who doesn't style their hair, it just makes my hair look greasy.I have no doubt the product works, it's just too cumbersome for me to routinely apply."
1,doesnt work,"i have been using these for 3 months now, religiously applying twice a day and it doesnt work. cheap but wont help."
4,Minoxidil Kirkland 6M supply,Good deal but would be better if they include one sprayer instead of two droppers.
4,It Works,I stopped using the product and things became worse. Recently I bought a whole year and definetely I see less shine.
5,Ornish's weight loss plan really works!,"This book is brilliant. Ornish shows how a low-fat vegetarian diet is healthy, delicious, and also just the thing for those wanting to loose weight. The first half of the book explains the plan in detail. The second half of the book is full of tasty recipes. I lost 20 pounds on Ornish's plan - very easily, too. I was never hungry, nor did I feel deprived. I recommend this book to everybody."
1,NEVER HP AGAIN,"At first I loved this camera. Yes it did go through batteries like crazy, but this being my first digital, I overlooked it. One day I just couldn't download my pictures on to my computer. So I bought a new memory card. Well guess what, it happened again, only this time even the store computers could not retrieve my picures. My memories lost. When I contacted hp they tried to tell me that my computer was not compatible with my camera. First of all, it worked for the year I have had it and if it were only my computer, why didn't it work in the stores? Needless to say, I am waiting on a new Canon. I will never purchase an hp again."
2,Disappointed!,"As soon as I see a new book with Susan Conant's name on it, I buy it. In the future, I'll check to see that the writing does NOT include her daughter's name. This book was such a disappointment. The main character aimed at being a bright, humorous modern Boston woman - - AND MISSED! Oh, how they missed! Chloe Carter has an inheritance from her uncle only if she enters a graduate degree and is so directionless that she basically tosses a coin. She's a shallow, vapid, vain, manipulative, sometime mean, bimbo and basically is not worth reading about. The food topic angle is the only plus. There is another title in the series, but I intend to avoid it. I can't believe that Susan Conant put her name on this writing. It MUST be her daughter's writing that she is lending her reputation to - - and it was a loving, but BIG mistake."
4,"Hot chefs, intrigue and recipes you can almost taste?","A page-turner from the start, ""Steamed"" was one of my most enjoyable summer reads. Chloe Carter is such a real protagonist, and the characters she encounters (some with more character than others!) are well-defined and interesting. I loved the twists and turns of the plot and I enjoyed the interpersonal connections between and among the characters. I can't wait to try the recipes in the back of the book...I drooled just reading them! How soon can I purchase Book 2 in this series?"
1,The victims are again mistreated,"This book should not have been about Stuart Eisenstat as we come away believing after reading it. Mr. Eisenstat is accomplished and clever and the more reason for him to have secured for the victims a fair shake. Instead his activities, as described in this book, are benefiting the German and Swiss Companies and deprive the victims of proper copensation. Only the Hungarian Government offered less compensation to the victims then what Mr. Eisenstat has arranged. The Hungarian Government offered each person whos relative was murdered during WW2 (aproximately)[$$] for a parent and [$$] for a brother or sister. This book is a depressing tale of personal ambition, misguided values and lack of remorse by a high ranking former official of the US Government. We hope that someone will take notice of how the VICTIMS have farred and make amends while there is still timefor the survivors to savor some decent treatment."
2,"decent story, but the prose feels mechanical","I'm completely inline with Quinnie's review. The story was entertaining enough, but Blum's writing style felt so unnatural that it frustrated me. Despite the lack of fluidity the plot still propelled me on to the end.Personally, I'm not thrilled with Blum's style, but I could see how some (I say ""some"" even though as a critic I'm in the minority on this one) might enjoy it."
2,I cannot get through the writing style,"This is a very complex, interesting story. I give credit to the author for taking a subject that so many have written on and finding a new way to approach it.As one of the biggest projects in my undergrad work was based on interviews of immigrants into the US because of WWII, I had a special interest in this book.But, to my chagrin, I simply couldn't get into the story. Why, you might ask? The answer is simple. I cannot read this prose.There are no quotations around the dialogue.The tense and point of view switch almost whimsically.The writer has such a very strange style. I'm sure that she did this on purpose, to heighten the overall mood of the book. I simply didn't want to put that much effort into reading it.If you're a pedestrian reader, like me, this is probably not your cup of tea.(*)>"
2,The interesting aspects of this story are overshadowed by superfluous lewdness,"I was looking forward to reading this book when I read the other reviews. However, the parts of this story which make it interesting- the descriptions of life during the war, survival, and the discovery of the main character's history - take a backseat to the authors apparent need to repeatedly dive into repeated graphic rape and sex scenes. This happens even at times when the story is focused on non-sexual events. The events which occupy most of the author's summary actually occur within the very beginning and very end of this book, almost appearing to be an afterthought. The middle 80% is occupied by a broken record of disturbing and unproductive sex scenes where nothing really happens."
5,riveting and haunting. a must for historical nonfiction enthusiasts.,A friend recommended the book knowing my preference for historical nonfiction. I could not put it down. The characters are haunting. I wish the author used quotes for speech and some of the writting is a bit over worked but the story is compelling and thought provoking.
4,Survivors of a very different war,"This book tells the other side of the Jewish Holocaust. The German women side. I am neither race, but also have spoken to German women who lived through WWII. The horrors that happen to the Jewish Nation was bad enough, but horrors also happen to German people in this war of Hitler's Good story of the other side."
3,Unable to put this book down,"I honestly could not put this book down. After each chapter, I took a moment to consider the story and the themes behind it. Many times, I had tears in my eyes; at other times I laughed aloud. I was sad to come to the end of the book and I've been thinking about the story ever since. I'm still undecided about how much I actually liked it. The story is compelling - it almost captures the complicated themes and emotions involved in this topic. The twists and turns in the plot make for a real page turner. The characters, however, are a bit lacking, and not quite fully developed.Any book that screams when you put it down and stays in your thoughts well after reading it, is a solid work and worth reading."
2,to violent for me,"The kindle sample was intriguing enough for me to buy the book.Thirty pages later, I had to remove it from my kindle. The graphic descriptions of assorted sexual assaults were too much for me."
4,Choices,"Auggh...the review I meant for this book went to you under the title of another book I read, Leap Into Darkness. Such is the problem of typing too quickly."
3,I Liked It......Kind of...,"It was a great story, but somehow it just seemed overwritten to me. Too much Trudy and not enough Anna. I would have been much happier to have read more about Anna's early days in Minnesota than the trials and tribulations of Trudy. Those sections of the book seemed forced and somewhat boring. Maybe a better editor?"
4,Could.Not.Put.It.Down,"I read this book on my Kindle (gotta love the Amazon Prime lending library) and could not put it down until I finished. The strength of the novel is Anna's story. As Anna's adult daughter Trudy tries to come to terms with her relationship with her mother, we learn the background of Anna's wartime experience in Germany. It's all the more horrific because we aren't told every lurid detail. The weakness of the novel, IMHO, is Trudy's story. We don't really have a sense of what Trudy is like, so at the end of the story, we are unable to fully understand the impact of what Trudy discovers and how she processes it. (I'm trying NOT to spoil the book for those who haven't read it yet ....) I would give the book four-and-a-half stars and greatly recommend it."
5,Those Who Save Us,I belong to a book club and we read this book because someone suggested it to us. Great book with some powerful women characters.
5,Great little book for instantaneous reference,"This is great for many things, like a reference or a pocket book for a quick reference on common notational problems and practices. I would certainly refer to this as a great, in expensive, text on many issues such as note placement, accidental orders, ""note stacking,"" and various other things. Great for students and professionals printing by hand or computer."
2,The plates are worth the price of the book,"The primary reason I buy the Osprey books are for the color plates. More often than not, the author, Rene Chartrande goes into obscure detail that adds little to the text. Like many of his other works, Chartrande does not reveal enough useful sources. Photographs of exhisting uniforms and equipment are helpful, but if these were in color v.s. black and white, it would enhance these books. Chartrande cranks out numerous books for Osprey, but it's looking more like he's going for quantity over quality. Chartrande should go back to the style and depth of his older works."
5,Pretty Clear,This book has been a very usefull and complete guide for my chidren learning and relationship between fathers and children.It is amazing the quantity of new knowledge we found on the simple words and rading from this book.
2,What has happened to her writing?,"I can't believe that the same author who wrote Lakota Surrender and Lone Wolf's Woman wrote this book. The plot is paper thin, the hero is annoying and the heroine is a childish idiot. I never could see what either one saw in the other. Thank God for the heroine's mother who is the 19th Century Western frontier version of Dr. Ruth. At least she gave me one good laugh from this mess. Read any of Kay's other books before you read this one."
4,One week late & horrible customer service,"I ordered this product from Amazon.com. This product is great, except to for the fact that i had to wait one week longer that i was told when i purchased this item. For some reason, the package was shipped near my house using UPS, then they shipped it back to another facility using USPS, which took an extra week! I called Amazon SEVERAL times and received no apology or explanation for the week delay. I was very unsatisfied with the customer service that i received."
3,Book deserves a second look,"Robert Gauldin's ""Harmonic Practice in Tonal Music"" may not be the world's greatest textbook for freshman theory, but it is not as bad as many reviews have indicated. Like his other books (on counterpoint) it does not teach itself. It is only a tool for a talented and well-prepared teacher. If consideration is given to the ideas contained within, the student can learn a great deal. Robert Gauldin is a talented and knowlegeable teacher, and both he and his book deserve more respect than they have been given in some of the reviews."
2,Too expensive,Textbooks are way too expensive and mine came used at a high price with writing all over it. But it is a rare book...
4,very good,"It was pretty good, except it didn't explain stuff as well as it should. Otherwise it was good. =)"
3,Not for the faint of heart,"It's really, really, HOT! But tasty. I brought it to a New Year's Eve Party and the guests were really having fun with it. Each new person that arrived was tested to see who could handle the most mouthfuls without water. It became almost a party game. If I were to buy it again, I would mix it with another non-spicy snack mix because it's too concentrated by itself."
1,The only Walden Farms product that disappoints,"I have been a fan of Walden Farms pancake syrup as well as their chocolate syrup and the jams. So I had high hopes about their ranch dip. UGH! I'm sorry to have to say it, since their other products are great, but this was an unpleasant esperience. The texture managed to be both slimy and clingy. I thought the taste was particularly unpleasant and I threw the entire content away. Kept the jar, though - Walden Farms uses nice glass jars! So I am still a fan of theirs, and I will continue to buy other products from them, but NOT this one."
1,Worst customer service ever!,"I got a LS3700 with 2221 songs ( LS-2953BP Backpack Combo) and I've used it few times and after not using it for few months I turned it back on and it wouldn't. LS3700 microphone broke so I've been trying to contact customer service to get it fixed cause it's an expensive item but if you goto their website, there is no contact phone# or email. They have a form where you can submit questions but they will take over 2 weeks to respond. It's not worth it!Their karaoke machine scores on if you put sound through the microphone the whole time. And they dont even have movies for the background. Just slideshow of pictures. It's not worth the price."
1,Nothing interesting,This book only shows some rare centers in Europe. Nothing special. Maybe is worth for a collector of architectural books...If you are intrested in designing a Child Care Center this book wont bring you new ideas. Will be useless.I returned mine.
5,Outstanding,"If you were an undergradate at a research university you may have wondered what was happening to you - why the system seemed geared towards retarding your personal growth, love of learning, etc. This book will help you to understand why."
5,One of the Best,"I was fortunate enough to see these kids open up for Joe Satriani in Cali, at the Luther Burbank Center. Everyone was there for Joe of course and as you could assume when they introe'd the kids, hardly anyone clapped or made them feel welcome.By the time they were through with us our minds were reeling and we were panting and wanting more! The ages defied me from 14 to 18, I hope these kids are not one hit wonders and truly go on to make it big.If you don't have this cd get it cause they are hard to find anymore. A must have."
1,refugee review,"i followed the reviews on this site and purchased the disc believing that that they were correct and it was a good cd. i have looked into the bands music influence and it was supposedly based on aerosmith whitsnake and another. if you have heard the first song the rest of the disc is nothing like it. hear the first song on youtube. i was fooled into buying this disk. i would not recommend this to anyone. this is a disc with only one good track which is #1. the rest of this album is complete crap. i took one for the team in following these idiots reviews. the whole album is like love ballads and something for your girlfriend only!!!!! i would rank this disc a -2 out of 5. DO NOT BUY THIS DISC. I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS DISC. IT IS VERY OVERATED. TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PERSON RANKED THIS MY MUSIC PREFERENCES ARE GUNS N ROSES,OLD METALLICA, SKID ROW, JUDAS PRIEST,RATT,DOKKEN, ETC. THIS ALBUM SUCKS."
2,few reasons to read,This book is very disjointed. The reader must understand that this is one mother's research about her son's reading development. It reads like a research article with many vague references to other studies. The good side of the book is that it would be beneficial for teachers to read as it gives insights to high-achieving students and over active parents.
4,Another wonderful collection of photographs,No disappointments here - somewhat posey at times but the composition and beauty still thrills. Get it if you are a fan or a collector.
2,Missy misses the point,"Following on from her unique debut album this effort misses in all areas and sounds like the songs were written back when songwriting was still a novelty for the singer/songwriter.The set is quite boring and the repeditive harmonies annoying.Goive this one a miss and move on the ""the o' razzle dazzle"""
3,"Not very durable, but you probably get what you pay for","I purchased these cases to go with the mini-DVD's for our video camera, and they have been a disappointment. They crack relatively easily, but honestly I am not sure that I should have expected differently for this price. If you are even a little hard on your mini-DVD cases you might look elsewhere for a case."
1,good for the novice,"Good for a beginner of if you just want to learn common things about some of the insects in your backyard. It doesn’t have any scientific names and not may insects in it. It does however, give good descriptive paragraphs about each insect in the book. As for a professional entomologist or a student, it is a waste of time."
5,Only wish it had more bug IDs in it,We found some bugs we couldn't ID. Otherwise great fun to use. Got these books for the grandson - he is just starting to really explore the great outdoors on the family camping trips. Terrific thanks!
1,Wonderful book; lousy Kindle adaptation!,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to understand the Incarnation. The Kindle format is loaded with typos, including referring to Arius variously as ""Arms"" and even ""Anus."" We deserve better and so does Archbishop Schonborn! Please clean it up, Amazon!"
4,beautiful but...,"I am a passionate lover of Star Wars and costumes so this was right up my alley. You finally get a good long look at the creatures, people and the magnificent costumes of the movies. The only flaw is that it shows that either Trisha or Lucas had a serious logic disconnect when it came to Amidala's clothes. I think they just wanted her to look amazing and she does but their is no continuity. The culture that produced the clothes of Ep. I could not have also had women wearing some of the things Amidala wears in Ep II and the clothes of Ep III look like they came from a differnet planet. In some scenes Amidala looks like she's from Naboo and in some scenes she looks like she's from Riley's Pleasure Planet. There just didn't seem to be too much thought put into her outfits."
5,I just received my copy...,"...the other day and I love it. A friend couldn't stop looking over my shoulder as I thumbed through it. The photos are great and show alot of detail. Another bonus is the chance to see the make-up on the actors. They are in full costume for the photos, so you get to see the full effect with hair and make-up. I think it's a great book for anyone who loved the rich costume details in the Star Wars film series. I also particularly enjoyed the renderings that were included. Each designer is different in how they render and it was fun to see how it looked on paper before it became the finished product."
4,Absolutely gorgeous,"This book is well laid out and nicely designed. I would rate it a five except for these problems: some good costumes from the prequels are left out and there is perhaps not enough information in the book about what the costume materials are and the inspirations for them. This is not to say that those things are not addressed; I just wish there was a little more.All in all, if this book even barely catches your eye, buy it. It's well worth the money."
2,Lacking,"I was really hoping to like this story, but found the characterization to be cartoon-like and the story to be lacking. While the talents of the writer cannot be denied, neither is this her best work. I am sorry to say that this book only left me sad and angry. At least the money went to a good cause."
5,Good Quality,"It's a pretty standard Breadboard, nothing fancy, but it's pretty solid and withstand the heavy and continuous use.I recommend it for engineering students, to do electronic projects."
5,Lexar 1 Gb Jump Drive - Get one.,"This product is great, just plug it it and it is recognized immediately. I've used it on multiple computers and it has saved me lots of time and effort transferring huge files. I am contemplating getting a 2Gb Jump drive, as well. I especially like the cap which snaps on to the other end of the body. It even looks pleasing."
1,Fishy smell...rancid or not distilled ?,"I have purchased twice in different locations/states. Both times the capsules small fishy, which should not be ifit is molecular distilled......as they say in very small lettering on the bottle. The alternative is that the oilwent rancid after they distilled it. I cut open a capsule...very fishy. Try a good fish oil...it does not smell.Nordic Naturals makes an excellent fish oil, very pure and made from small fish, anchovies,etc which have lessbioaccumulated contaminants to begin with."
3,Good,"I learned some valuable tips that made it worth the price, but there's no index so either memorize every tip, or plan on digging a lot to recall something."
2,supposed to be mac compatible,if u have windows its probably better. mac osx an 9.2 make duplicate non playable files (ie._filename.mp3) and the player stops after each track. so unless u manually remove the fake file it will not go from song a to song b and so on. also usb isnt 2.0 on older macs. the newer macs have usb 2.0 and if u have a good ds store remover program and usb 2.0 its worth the money. otherwise pc speed would be good
1,SUCKS,"If you want to sound like a weird robot, like something out of the Outer Limits when your up on stage, this is the thing for you! I tried all the settings I could on this and none of them improved my voice. I had multiple choices of weird, strange, bizarre effects but that's not what I was looking for. I wanted something that made my voice sound BETTER, not WORSE. Is that too much to ask? Save your time and money. Try something else."
3,decent model,"One tiny piece seemed to be missing (the compass), but it was inside the cockpit and not visible, so we didn't fret it. Other than that, it was easy to follow the instructions and put together."
3,not that durable,This is probably the least durable helmet that I have had. I did not know that they would make something for kids this flimsy!
3,eh...,"The book is OK, not sure what I was expecting, maybe something more forceful on ""don't suck your thumb"" - this story is a bit odd. Not sure my 4 year old really got the point of the book, even after I explained it to her."
3,If only it worked...,"I got this book on a recommendation from another parent, to help discourage my then 3-year old from sucking her tumb. I think it is a great idea having a book like this. But I was not so fond of the illustrations, and the rhymed text is at times awkward; the book appears as if put together by creative preschool teachers rather than by a writer and an illustrator. Perhaps I would have been more complimentary if the book ""worked"" but my daughter not only has not stopped sucking her tumb, she also doesn't like me to read her this book anymore."
3,"Ok romance, but anachronisms and plot thinness bring the book down","""A Matter of Pride"" is a fun romance, with a good heroine in Eden, and the hopelessly confused Ryeburn as the hero, but certain anachronisms like the surgeon at the end who uses anti-septic methods sticks out in Regency England. Also the tension and the coincidendal misunderstandings or overhearings is overdone here. Could have been better. 3 stars, and great motto ""Never Forget Your dreams"""
4,Beware,"It was stupid of me to buy this CD--I didn't know it's only talking.This is a CD full of interviews and radio station Ads and girls screaming, very funny, very real, (that's why I give it 4 stars) but no music at all. For baby boomer-Beatle Fans, this is definitely a classic buy, but for me, a teenager, it does not touch me at all, only boring...."
4,Evesham Pitcher,Product was shipped quickly; although it matches the set it is a bit different than the older one.
5,Surviving parenthood for real!,Must watch! I use this show as therapy to survive parenting a teen. It's not easy and this show reminds us we are not alone!Love Ron Howard got creating the characters and keeping them alive all these years.
5,Terrific Series,"I chose to give Parenthood a five star rating because I very much enjoy the characters and the story line. I like the idea of a family being very close even though they often disagree and are very different from each other with different challenges in their lives. I especially enjoy the fact that many real life problems are presented and treated pretty realistically such as Chris's breast cancer, Max's autism, Crosby's immature, yet endearing personality, etc. I had already seen the majority of the shows, but enjoyed watching them again. I feel that any production that Ron Howard is envolved with is going to have some merit.."
2,Hard to use and crashed my PC,"I needed a card reader for a Sony memory stick and thought this would work. It is inconvenient to use because you can't easily grasp the card once it's in the card reader. It is necessary to remove the card reader from the slot in order to remove the card. Then I got the ""blue screen of death"" while using it. I have never had this crash situation before with XP. I returned it to Amazon. Amazon has a very good return policy. Thanks, Amazon."
1,What they don't tell you...,I have used roxio's toast program in my college classes. This product is pitiful in compairson. I burned my first CD-R on it and took it to a friends house to view the stuff on it. Upon putting it into the CD drive it autoinstalled somehting called the roxio viewer on the system.This viewer is frequentely the cause of problems (as I subsequentely found out). It rewrote something in the BIOS and is causing problems with the whole system. In addition it rewrote part of the CD-Driver...adn now it will not work at all. The only possible fix is to re-install teh drivers from my operation system disk....which is impossible with out a working CD Drive. And this may not even fix the problem...
1,Buyer beware!,"This software is technically complicated. Roxio technical support is one of the worst, if not the worst, I have encountered.One part of the suite of programs invariably causes other programs in the suite to fail. This is the same company that included ""Take Two"" with Easy Creator 5. This was a program that allowed you to back up your system to CD's. After about a year, they announced (very discretely!) that the program could cause problems with various operating systems and that it should be uninstalled immediately. There was no offer to compensate those that paid for this software. Even after that debacle, the tech support has not improved. If you want to talk by phone, for most it is your long distance call, and the wait time is long. In some cases you may end up paying more for the long distance call than you paid for the software. Bad news! Try Nero 5.5, PictureIt, and RealOne Player. a much better combination."
1,buggy,unfortunately this product is still very buggy. Version 5 works just fine. I would stick with v5 if you have it.wait until they release a service pack.
1,Be careful,"I lost my entire Windows XP installation because upon reboot after installing this I could not get past the 'Welcome' screen.I followed all the instructions posted at the Roxio website, and none of them fixed the problem.Luckly, I was able to remove the laptop hard drive and mount it in another PC running XP and get the data off it, but I never did get it to boot until I reinstalled. (The Windows XP 'R'epair process couldn't even reboot the machine at the proper point and continue...)My suggestion is to find another product, NOT one by Roxio. EZ-CD Creator 4 was an excellent product... 5 and 6 have been nothing but problems from almost everyone I have heard install them. (System instabilities, etc)You have been warned."
1,look elswhere,"Everytime I used the product to make a cd (data cd or music) it would lock up my computer to the point I had to physically power it off. Roxios' support people told me to remove everything from my start up list. I don't want to be doing that everytime I want to use the stupid program... I finally gave up and deleted (uninstalled) the program, only to find out by doing that it deleted part of my Photo Suite program as well. Stay far away from this bomb..."
4,Still Exploring...,"I installed Roxio Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 on my PC yesterday and so far, I love it. Installation and registration were a snap. I am still exploring all the extra goodies and features. With two small children, the PhotoSuite feature, will come in handy. I was able to edit the quality of a photo, as well as, add a fun caption. I was so proud of my own photo creation, that I wanted to share it. So, I did. I was able to select send e-mail directly from the command bar. Too cool... I also had fun editing my audio tracks. I'm certainly not a Disc Jockey, but with the AudioCentral I can mix and edit my music, to my style. I look forward to finding new projects to create with my Creator 6. I am only rating this product 4 stars, because I have not seen it all. This product is exactly what I was looking for, and I didn't even know it."
1,More than a trash..a hazardous to your PC,"This software seems to mess up the disk partition assigning whole different drive letters at random after the installation. You can't even uninstall completely because it puts permanenet damage to your windows registry and creates orphant dlls, etc. I cannot believe anyone selling this kind of horrible software. This software will cause a lot of damamge than a good. Now, my disk imaging software (Acronis True Image 7) and other *.dll dependent programs no longer work.Roxio should recall this junk immediately."
1,Shameful,I own version 5 Platinum and have not had any problems. I read many reviews on the Vers. 6 Basic and Platinum and was not willing to take a chance on purchasing. I purchased a DVD burner which included the Basic Version EZ CD & DVD Creator 6. I installed the thing and it could not see my drives; not even the drive it came with. I turned off Drag and Drop and still nothing. I went to Roxio site and there was no real answer to resolve the problem. I tried reinstalling and nothing. I tried working with the registry and removing the filters they suggested I remove and still nothing. After approx. 3 to 4 hours of this I decided to uninstall and reinstall Version 5 Platinum. Everything works fine. It is truly a shame that a company with such a good reputation has allowed this software on the shelves for sale. The consumer needs protection from companies that sell faulty software to unsuspecting consumers. Shame on you Roxio.
1,This is Junk!!!,"Received Easy CD&DVD Creator6 Platinum for Christmas because I had really liked version 4. Have not been able to get a complete install on it to date, and the parts that did install didn't function right. Went to Roxio's support site & found that many purchasers had same[and many other]problems. Some even had to restore their PC. Sent Emails to their tech support and received one answer so far. It took 11 DAYS for them to answer, and it was just a bunch of babble,nothing to do with the problem. I have uninstalled&deleted everything I can find related to it on my PC, and thrown the blasted thing away. I will NEVER buy another ROXIO product again."
1,Doesn't install,"I have had this product for months now, and I cannot install it on my computer. Roxio ""support"" has been no help. There is an upgrade available at their website, but it hasn't done anything to help me install this product. I'd love to hear from other's who have had this problem!!!"
5,Does what its supposed to.,"Roxio 6 platnium picks up where 5 left off by expanding the capabilities of the core program itself. The burning aspect leaves little to be desired for DVD's, CD's are burnt with precision and if installed correctly causes little problems (XP sp1). Overall, it does exactly what it's supposed to and nothing else."
5,Great For Burning DVD's,"Roxio's Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 is a huge improvement from Easy CD Creator 5. It has a smooth interface for editing video and burning to DVD. The CD burning of music and data is excellent. The price after rebates is very low, so now's the time to buy."
1,My worst software experience ever!,"I have spent hours and hours trying to make this product work, with only limited success. I have been reading the on-line discussion forum at Roxio's support site and am amazed at how many problems are being experienced with this software and with the lack of tech support. Many knowledgeable people advising to steer clear of this product. I echo that sentiment."
1,Buy something else,"Roxio will not copy files from a networked drive properly. You will get the directory tree structure, and the file names entered into the FAT. This leads you to believe you have copied the files you need. But when it comes time to read those files, the come up empty! This product is nowhere near worth the price they are asking."
1,A Total Rip-off,"Nothing but problems, bugs, freeze-ups, and counterproductive slop. If you choose to buy this junk, kiss your cash goodbye and plan on finding something else that actually works. I will never touch a Roxio product again."
2,Broke after 3 months,"I really like this coat -rack. It's beautiful and seemed very sturdy. Unfortunately after 3 months of using it, it crashed to the floor one day for no apparent reason. The feet broke out of the base and splintered beyond repair. It was not over loaded and only had light coats and scarves.I am very sad. I really liked this coat-rack."
2,Not for technical people,"This book is not for technical people who are eager to learn Linux. It justs give brief information on Linux, something you may have already read a thousand time in the introductions of Linux documents. It is definitely not in depth enough to teach you how to administrate a Linux server."
2,resource only,"I was very disappointed in this book. It does superficially go over topics but no depth; it does at the end of the chapter however, give references to get further information. I find I keep looking in my other Linux books to understand how to use the commands mentioned in the book. Your money is better spent on other system administration books. To find out which ones, just read the ""further readings"" at the end of the chapters and the end of the book!"
5,A Keeper!,"Sharon Pisacreta's second novel from Leisure Books gives a knockout read to those looking for more than ""just another romance."" Salome Hall has real backbone, and Marc Cooper plenty of magic -- these two make you laugh with them, cheer them on and then put this book on your keeper shelf!"
4,"Simple but a ""heart squeezer""","This is the 3rd book after ""A Tree... "" and ""Joy In the Morning"" I've read. Admiring her simple, tacful and truthful style, I started reading this book with easy pleasure but ended the reading with lots of new feelings. Though ""A Tree ..."" is her best, Maggie-Now is her second best."
4,"For the price, what's to complain about? Some chipped paint. That's about it.","these are little brackets that fit 1/4"" rode and hold it to the wall. LOTS of them were chipped paint, but where they are used it didn't matter to us. Comes with screws and anchors. For the price (about $5) it did the job."
5,Lego Bionicle 8593 Makuta review,"This toy is amazing!... Bionicle has been out for a couple of years now, but until now no one has seen what Makuta really looks like. It has great articulation, with moving elbows, hands, arms, head, and legs. It has three spaces to put kraata, and its head and mask have two heads that you can switch between. It comes with the konohi mask of shadows and a double bladed scythe. Turn the knob on its back and it swings the scythe back and forth. Buy it!"
4,Shoegazer delight...,"This was my second Dandy's album (after Come Down)- although it doesn't have anything as insanely catchy as Last Junkie, i prefer it overall. its much more shoegazer than their next effort, and you can just lose yourself in the guitars in song after song. theres some tongue-in-cheek humour (eg: Lou Weed, where the singer sounds a bit like Transformer-era or even Velvets Reed at times, which is great, but the one place i strongly suggest it DOESN'T work is when Young Tom intrudes over the early part of the 16 min rave-up. this was such a brilliant piece of music, and it should have been treated with more respect. if not for this i think i would have given the album 5 stars..."
1,Go watch TV,"IT STINKS. This was the most boring and worst book I have ever pained myself to read. Don't get me wrong, Al is a gret guy. I knew him personally, but this bio just didn't do him justice. Save yourself the headache: don't read it."
4,"Hammond's scholarship solid, sober","Hammond demonstrates again why he is one of the most respected scholars dealing with Alexander and Macedon. His treatment is solidly grounded in the main historical sources- Arrian, Curtius Rufus, and Diodorus- as well as his own life's work. Alexander is one of the most controversial historical figures and has attracted a wide range of authors; from the brilliant to the sentimental (Peter Green) to the narcissitic (Michael Wood). Caveat lector! While often lumped in with Alexander's apologists (Tarn et al), Hammond's work is generally insightful, evenhanded, and readable, and this is no exception. The book is rather slim and general, but well-referenced (and details are in Arrian if you want them)."
1,Doesn't match color on website,"This color turned out to be a medium grey color. While the gold and silver colors are good, this color wasn't even close to that shown on the company website."
1,"great idea, but they just don't last long","I really wanted this to work. The alternative costs hundreds of dollars. I have a day care and sanitation is a high priority. I bought my first one and the sensor never worked, Amazon gladly replaced it and the new one worked for 2 weeks and then that sensor stopped working. My sister has one and had the same problem. her husband takes theres apart and fixes it everytime which I don't have the know how to do. Amazon took back the second one and refunded me, so it was worth the risk. Hopefully the company will fix the glitch and then I will try again."
1,buying my third one now. it is great when it works!!,"1st one die after 9 months2nd one die after 6 monthsthird one a charm?I simply can't find anything else like it. When it works, it just wonderful. The family so used to it... This become running expense of every 6th months..."
2,I loved it while it worked,"The expression ""Too good to be true"" fits here. Why are commercial motion-activated faucets $300-400 and this little gadget is 1/10th the price? Quality. Yes, it works very well out of the box and I thought it was great. After 5 months passed then it just stopped working. New batteries didn't help, cleaning it didn't help. Bought a second one and had similar results, although it made it to 6 months this time.Great idea, poor quality. Quite a shame as I would have purchased more of them if they lasted longer."
1,OK till it stopped working,"It worked fine for a couple of months. Then it stopped. It makes a clicking noise when activated, but, alas, no water."
2,"good idea, poor implementation","product is cheaply manufactured, flimsy, weak, leaks very easily; but when u get it to work right (it is possible with some creativity), it is handy and useful."
2,caused a problem with sink,I bought this item and it was easy enough to hook up. the problem is you have to leave the water faucets open and minutes after I set it up the water burst through the pipes and flooded my house. I had to call a plumber and I tried to return the item and was told by the seller I had to contact the company that made it. I did that and they told me if I wanted a refund I had to get it from the seller. The seller has not returned my latest e-mail and had refused me a refund. I paid $50 for this item and it cost me a plumber and All I want is a refund. I have never had an issue with returning Anything from amazon.
1,Does not work,"This is a very poor product the first faucet tried to put it on couldn't because of wrong adapter, then had a sink installed in playroom and tried to install and leaked and would not work even with brand new batteries, save your money do not buy, since didn't work on first sink had to wait until second sink was installed and now to late to return without paying shipping. So am stuck with it. Very useless."
1,Poor quality,"I was very disappointed in this product and will not buy it again. I would have returned them but I hate doing returns so I kept them and will use them for teaching purposes only. They are not suede uppers and they do not have leather straps. Most of the sandal is cardboard, stiff and does not work well as a dance shoe. I have discouraged my students from buying this shoe as I beleve the picture shown and description given is not accurate."
5,"Great Magazine, but would like it in Kindle format",I have been reading it since my parents introduced me to it in the 1970's. I would love it in Kindle format.
1,Waste of money!,"This review is about: ""Understanding by Design - Study Guide"". I bought this book, because the reviews suggested it was the real thing. But it is a thin volume with study questions for the original.A lot of money wasted, because there is no way to send it back from Germany."
3,"The book could be better, but it's currently the best!","THe book needs more solved questions, math and law solutions."
3,okay at first,"This drive gave up after 1 1/2 years because connector became intermittent. I have had much better luck with San Disk Titanium Cruzer, and Corsair drives."
5,Nice flash drive,"Flash drives in general are one of the more useful inventions of the technology age, and this one works as advertised and I have had no problems. I have had good experiences with Lexar flash drives previously, and again with this model. 1GB capacity is really nice for my work, which involves a lot of moving files between work and home. I had maxxed out my previous 128MB flash drive so now there's plenty more room. Probably by the time I max this one out, a 10GB model will be available for cheap.5 stars for a problem-free product that works as advertised."
5,Best value I've seen,"Really, it does the job. It holds a great amount of space and goes with me everywhere, and I have no complaints. I do not actually use it as a keychain, so I can't really comment on how reliable it would be, but it seems strong enough to take a good beating. I've certainly dropped it enough times to know that. Highly recommended."
3,Glad It Is Fiction (3 1/2 stars),"This is a well written book, however I had such a tough time buying into the premise of the story at the begining, that I was well into it before I just sat back and let the story tell itself. In this book, the CIA contains an element within it's operation which uses psychiatry and psychological means to target people and turn them into assassins. It is called The Artificial Assassin Program. It seems to be functioning with impunity and great success until one of it's targets proves to be more than a match for it. How he goes about defeating the enterprise with the help of a reporter who is investigating one of the more horrendous outcomes of it's efforts makes entertaining reading and interesting story telling."
1,worthless,I honestly have found no use in taking this vitamin. I am an avid vitamin junkie and have been taking super b-complex for about a month now and have no increased energy as it claims to provide. I do not reccomend it
1,Jams like crazy,"This was a great deal, but as they say...you get what you pay for. It jams incessantly and for the past month or so, almost every time I try using it. The features are nice, the duplexing works well but only when you can keep it from jamming. I am putting mine in the basement and replacing it with a Brother duplexing laser. Stay away from this printer; it is not worth it at any price."
2,Worst Panasonic product I have ever owned,"Most of the Panasonic products I have owned have been good to excellent. I bought this printer on the basis of my good experiences with them. But this product really shakes my customer loyalty. With nearly every print of 4 pages or more I can expect a paper jam. Envelopes? Don't even try it. And the drivers are awful. When the expensive toner runs out, this printer is going into the dumpster."
3,no sharing,I too noticed that the printer does not like to be shared.Then I noticed they sell a similar model with a network capability for double the cost (KX7110).go figure.I guess the only way to share among multiple pc is to use a cheap printer server. ...
1,It's a shame I can't give it 0 stars,"This printer isn't worth buying at all. Somebody bought 7 of them for our office - big mistake. They constantly jam, and the printer is to reliant on the software that comes with it (not the driver) that it constantly has to be removed and re-installed. Also, 4 of the printers have had their drums go bad in the first 6 months. When I called tech support, their answer was that the drum that it ships with isn't a very good quality, and that if you buy a new one it shouldn't wear out as quickly (yet still the drum warranty is only for 90 days)!! They're sending you inferior merchandise and they know it.The toner cartridges are cheap and leak, jamming the printer and drum with toner."
1,Not a Book About Terrorism,"I did not feel that this book met its objective of informing the reader about terrorism. The author spends a lot of time defending the Christian religion, instead of focusing on ways to prevent acts of terrorism. I got the impression that the author is more against ""liberals"" than she is against terrorists.The book failed to target the real culprit: the terrorists themselves."
1,Racist nonsense,"What can I say? This book is racist claptrap - tabloid scare stories to frighten ignorant Americans.I have lived and worked in London for over thirty years and I can assure you that this, this.......object bears no realtion to reality whatsover.I'd give it minus stars if I could."
2,Disappointing Re-Recording,"I've been a Kenny Rogers fan since I was 10 years old, and I have a number of his CDs. Kenny, of course, was a huge hit machine in the late 70s and early 80s, and he made some truly great country-pop music. Unfortunately, this CD consists of 1991 re-recordings of his hits. I was not aware of this detail when I bought this CD, and the only warning is a miniscule reference on the CD back indicating that it's ""newly recorded.""Kenny's voice sounds fine on the CD, and some of the songs don't sound considerably different from the original versions. However, all of the songs have the same producer - resulting in an overly varnished sound that takes the edge off some of his best hits. Fortunately, a plethora of other Kenny Roger's greatest hits collections are available - including the incredible 4-disc ""Through the Years: A Retrospective."" Unless you're a Kenny completist, you should start with another greatest hits collection."
2,Get any other best of Kenny Rogers CD,"I picked this up on impulse this week. The songs sounded ""tinny"" poor mastering, and not the songs I remembered. Plus... there are a lot of Kenny Rogers songs that I like that are not on this CD.Looking at Amazon today, I see that almost any of the other,(and there are a lot) of Best of Kenny Rogers collections have a much beeter collection of songs, and one would hope for better production as well.Skip this CD."
1,Not worth it,"This DVD is cheap because it has NOTHING useful. The garden in the DVD is the ugliest one I have ever see or can ever imagine. If you think the garden will transform from the ugliness into something more sightful, youare right. The garden looks exactly the same after the entire video except one or two bare 2-foot trees have been erected. I think this is at best the level of amateur gardener home-made video freely distributed on Youtube."
5,AWKWARD,Such a good show. I love the love triangle stuff and the counselor on the show is soooo funny. YOU'RE WELCOME
5,One of the best shows on TV,"Not sure exactly what hooked me to this show - the good looking characters, the witty one liners, the show stealing mother of the main character Jenna or Jenna herself. You really see life through her eyes and that is quite hilarious - it reminds me a lot of, not as much Juno like the other reviewer mentioned, but maybe more My so called life - but funnier and not quite as dramatic - girl likes boy, girl has competition for boy, boy likes girl but many dilemmas ensue of course- I would definitely check it out - I'm glad I did!"
3,Eye of the Tigers Part 1,Nice book. Needs an updated version. Should have captured other Tigermeet jets instead on staying on a few subject matter.
2,unsteady,"I love the look of this faux tiffany, but the base didn't fit properly and it is unsteady and tilts. I just kept it anyway.j"
3,Review of Klostermaier's 'Hinduism: A Short History',"This history is well intentioned, but eventually it becomes far too boggled by the author's undying affection for sanskrit terminology. I was eventually overwhelmed by the frequent references to specific religious concepts drawn directly from the Sanskrit. Reading become a labor rather than a pleasure. The history seems fair-handed and thorough."
4,Gruesome...,"Set in a tiny Wisconsin town a few years after the Civil War, this story centers upon a diptheria epidemic that suddenly and completely sweeps over the people, killing them one by one and setting the horrified survivors at the brink of insanity. It's completely gruesome, but like the proverbial trainwreck, you're powerless to set it aside until the gory end."
3,Unpleasant,"I gave it 3 stars because the writing is haunting, and I've never read O'Nan's other work, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. But I think there could be much more compelling renderings of the same story, and there are portions of the story that are downright reprehensible with no apparent explanation except the horror of always being the survivor while everyone around you dies. All in all, I just didn't care for it. Washington Post did it a disservice by comparing O'Nan to Stephen Crane and Stephen King -- it set the wrong expectations. Much more Joseph Conrad and the Heart of Darkness. Fine if you like that sort of thing, but irritating if you thought you were curling up with Stephen King."
2,Worth a quick read,"I did enjoy reading this short novel, but after I finished I did return it to the bookstore. Mr. O'Nan's writing is clear and sharp, and his use of the third person is not only original but highly appropriate to the story. The reader really gets a sense for the situation facing the protagonist. However, by the end I felt that Mr. O'Nan had trivialized evil, the theme that dominates the novel. In fact evil is the only interesting character in the book, imposing its will on the helpless characters. Other readers may not have a problem with Mr. O'Nan's characterization, but I certainly did. The book is worth a read and can be tackled in an afternoon, but I don't think its good enough to own. See if you can find it at the library instead."
3,For a Total Newbie,"I was a little dissappointed in this guide. I thought it would offer better descriptions and more species. The very first moth I went to look up wasn't even in there (the satin moth). I realize this is more for a beginner or a child, but I thought this was even more basic than that."
5,very pleased customer,I was very pleased with this purchase. I was a little apprehensive about purchasing a used book but it was in excellent condition and was very pleased how fast I received it. Good Job.Thank You.
3,Fun,I was a little disappointed that I could not use my game pad on these games. Other than that it was fun. d
2,Not my cup of tea,"I'm not sure, but I think it had something to do with Lyle's satan-like behavior that turned my off to this one. I liked the storyline, however, 'I'm pregnant and the real father doesn't find out for 15 years', but the atrocious and dreadful circumstances that Maggie endures just to protect the secret...and then finally reveals the truth in the end...is just not my idea of romance."
5,Back to basics building from LEGO,"Lately, most LEGO sets have seemed more like models than collections of pieces that can be turned into just about anything. LEGO's new Make and Create line is a very refreshing change from this trend. This Air Blazers set contains lots of basic pieces, some specialized ones, instructions for building a helicopter and two planes, and plenty of inspiration for building many more fliers. This is a great set that can be used to build lots and lots. Also, be sure to check out LEGO's Make and Create web site. It has some great activities including a wonderful Design School that will make you a more sophisticated and knowledgable LEGO builder."
5,Everything you want to know about this charming gangster!,"This is, by far, the most informative biography on the legendary gangster Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel. It looks at his life as a mobster, and as a business man and of coarse, as a ladies man. Hard to believe how such a charming and dapper man could be what he was. This is a must see piece for anyone who is interested in history, Las Vegas, Bugsy, the mob, .....You'll enjoy this..i guarantee!!!"
5,Eating Well does it again!,"Eating Well Magazine in my favorite cooking magazine and this book is every bit as good. The recipes are easy to do, and are delicious, as well as healthy. My only negative comment is that I already have a lot of the recipes from the magazine."
4,Good stuff,"I got this book because I loved - EatingWell Serves Two: 150 Healthy in a Hurry Suppers so much. This book is close to as good, but the portions didn't work as well for me.Most seem to serve 3 to 5 people depending on your hunger level. Make sure you have a good side dish however and it is the perfect book for finding something great and healthy to cook up for company.Very easy to follow and the dishes are simple without to many odd (read hard to find) ingredients."
4,Not for Walking,"Husband wanted these for going hunting. He says they keep his feet nice and warm but the bottoms are soft. He has to wait until he's in the deerstand to put them on AFTER drying his boots off. Once they're on, he says his toes stay nice & toasty. Don't know how durable they are; he's only used them once. True to size."
1,Lack of facts/sources appalling,"Mr. Lachman hasn't a clue what he is talking about in this book. His solution for dogs that pull when walking? Buy a Halti. What a trainer! In addition, his ""facts"" on specific dog breeds is some of the most ignorant ramblings I've read in many a moon. Avoid this book at all costs."
5,The greatest book on training and caring for your dog!,"I was searching for a book that would teach me to train a dog naturally, without any harmful stimuli. I came across ""Dogs on the couch,"" and have been so pleased with the book. It's a very well-written book, and provides the best information that I have ever read on training puppies, older dogs, as well as tackling ""doggie problems."" I am now prepared to properly train our new MASTIFF puppy. Definately the best dog book you'll ever own!"
1,The real betrayal,"The real betrayal here is that a group of women abandonned their solemn commitments to follow the psycho-babble path to personal fulfilment. It rings as true as every other 60s & 70s rejection of authority in the name of ""freedom."" For those of like mind, this book will be affirming in the pursuit of self. For those with true integrity of conscience, it will simply be sad."
1,Not worth the price,This was very flimsy and cheap. Not worth the price. I sent it back immediately And will order one that is stutdier
3,Doesn't live up to its title,"I got the book at christmas time, thinking there would be some chilling ghost stories inside. Boy was I wrong. The stories are not scary, but in a way quite sad. I had to put the book down because it was starting to depress me.It's not really all that bad, except for page 107 & 108 being reversed. I actually never really noticed the mistake, because I read the book quite fast.There are a lot of stories inside. Some go on forever, and some are short. They're very descriptive, and seem to trail on.I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone who wants to read about chilling cold ghost stories. The illustrations seem to fit the stories pretty well though.Save your time and money, unless you want something to read while you are eating breakfast, or you are on the subway."
1,Another Horrible Waste of Time,"Along with the author's other Christmas ghost story book, this book seems to be written by a fifth grader - the language is not scholarly or intelligent at all. For real ghost story fans, these stories are ridiculous. They all are simply stories with a ""supernatural"" element whereby there is a happy ending and all is well. Someone needs an operation, has a friend who died, and wins a lottery, etc. Boring and silly. Don't waste your time. Buy the works of ""real"" ghost story authors like Blackwood and Le Fanu instead."
2,Not as nice as I expected,"They look fine from a distance, but once you hold the wine glasses, you'll immediately notice the irregular shapes of the bowls. The inconsistencies and ""wobbliness"" of the bowls are a turn off.They also don't ring as well as other similarly riced glasses, such as the Luigi Bormioli ones."
2,Be Carefull,Purchased this set...was very upset that part of the headboard was cracked.The drawers for storage dont fit correctly.Looks nice but not that great!!
2,I wish I knew if this TV were any good,"This is more of a review of Amazon than of this TV.My wife bought me this TV for Christmas, but I wanted the larger model (40+ inches), and not the 32 inch.Well, it's been a nightmare trying to return the TV. I've called about 4 times, and each time they tell me that they will call me back (never happens). Now they tell me it will cost me $100 to return it.Given the grief I've gone through to return this, and the 'iffy' nature of getting a HDTV that has issues, I think I'd want to go to a store to buy the TV, even if I have to pay a bit extra. I just don't like the ""you're on your own, good luck!"" attitude Amazon had regarding these high ticket items. It's fine for a book or a DVD, but when you're spending 2 or 3 thousand dollars, I'd want some assurance that I'm getting what I paid for!I'm sure this TV is great, most of the reviews say so. Perhaps buying somewhere else will help prove it."
4,Are they True Confessions?,"The story takes place in 1832. Charlotte Doyle is a 13 year old girl traveling across the Atlantic Ocean, from England to America, without her parents. The story starts off with an important warning that warns readers to beware of strong ideas and actions. This was a time in life that girls were expected to act as respectful ladies. This book forshadows several things. Why is a 13 year old girl traveling so far away from home without her parents. Will Charlotte Doyle remain the person she once was, a ladylike girl from a respectful family. Will you ever know the truth? What are the true confessions of Charlotte Doyle."
3,Good,"I was required to read this book for school and couldn't help having a bad attitude towards it. At first I expected it to be boring and drawn-out but found something much different. This novel shows a girl change in her thoughts, feelings, appearence, and overall self. After an exciting and mysterious voyage on a feared ship whith a twisted crew and captain charlotte finds herself with a whole new perspective. This book has great descriptions, you feel like you know Charlotte very well, it is a little confusing because of the references to the setting of a ship that most people are not familiar with, but shockes you with a surprise ending. Fabulous story that you will thorouly enjoy reading!"
1,terrible book,"The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle is about a girl about thirteen. Her father has a company in Europe. They were moving back to the States, but Charlotte's parents wanted her to finish her studies in Europe. Charlotte must sail alone on a ship called the Seahawk. There is a mystery on the ship.One of the sailors Zacharia, told Charlotte she shouldn't be on the ship. The captain convinces Charlotte to tell him what she sees and hears on the ship. Zacharia gives Charlotte a knife for protection. Charlotte eventually found out that the captain was using her.I would recommend this book to anyone likes adventure and mystery. This is a serious book. If you don't like serious, you won't like this book."
2,Too obviously subversive,"Reading this with my 6th grade tutee. I'm all for books about women shirking the rule of oppressive men and learning to be independent. But I felt the book shallow. Where is the source of reason and the rationality for a girl's search for independence? I didn't find it here because the antagonist is so unrealistically evil. I know this is fiction, and a children's book to boot, which explains why everything is so obviously black and white, but Captain Jaggery is so uninterestingly evil. He's more like a scratching post that you automatically have to hate. Good way to encourage directionless angst. Besides that though, I did find it suspenseful at times, so I give it a 2."
3,ok book,"There is a girl named charlotte doyle. She went on ship. There is a captian jaggery who wanted the murder to come out. Who murder Mr.hollybass, and they accused charlotte of doing it. So then she was put in jail. There was a man named zachariah who was thought to be but he wasn't he was hidding in the jail. Sothen Charlotte and him were going tto get the crew to go after Mr.Jagger .So Charlotte went to her cabin and Mr.Jagger was in it and then he went after her and fell off the ship. Then they made Charlotte captain. Then she got back home. But then ran away and went back to the ship.It was an ok story, It was an adventurest, exciting, thrilling story.I didn't really like it because it went into to much details."
3,"Cornwall, NY Sixth Grader","I am a sixth grader. In The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle a girl named Charlotte Doyle has to go to Providence to meet her family of richness and cleanliness. On the way to Providence she has to go on a ship of dirty crew members, except Captain Jaggery. Once by the ship Captain Jaggery tells her that the other families are not going to be coming. On the night she boards she sees a mysterious man climbing on the ship called The Seahawk. During the voyage the game of murder is started. The twists and turns can go anyway,Read more to find out."
5,The Best Book Ever,I read this book a few years ago and when I say this title come up my heart jumped. This was one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys mystery and adventure. Read On!
3,Rescue Truck,"The Rescue Truck is a strange looking affair about 13"" long or so. I like the engine and the 3 axle steering. I can't see,however, what is new about the steering system. I have dozensof technic sets and it's nothing new. The water hose can be adjusted (cool), but it's always breaking. Although this is agood idea for a set, I'd make it bigger (aviation fire trucksare huge!) and I'd make it more realistic. It's an all right set."
2,"After 3 years, started popping","I bought this as part of a CV 5.1 HT system. The rest of the system is great, as was the sub initially. Unfortunately, after about 3 years of use, it has started popping at random intervals, regardless of whether it is idle or in use. This even happens if I disconnect the sub from the system but leave the power plugged in. The pops have become more frequent over time, and now I won't even turn it on because it drives me nuts.I called CV and they said it sounds like the amp is bad, which is consistent with the scattered info I could find online about this sort of problem. CV's replacement amp is $250. Forget it. I'll replace it with a different brand."
1,computer table,"I would not buy this item again. The wrong mouse shelf was sent. After several phone calls, I received the correct mouse shelf. Two wheels cracked because they were of such poor quality."
1,Aliens are among us?,"I loved O. Stone's movie. I wanted to read this book, but I discovered that M. Marrs also wrote: ""Alien Agenda: Investigating the Extraterrestrial Presence Among us"".Well that does it for me. I won't read the book.Now that's up to you! I thought this was an interesting peace of information for any potential reader."
2,Disappointing and Unreliable,"This one is more of a guilty pleasure than a serious work. Not very well researched it seems to throw everything into the pot without regards to veracity. Nothing is footnoted: not quotes, assertations or newspaper articles. So if you want to follow up on or verify something you read here, good luck because you are on your own. The structure of the book follows no logical flow either- just pick and choose from the table of contents and read whatever you want that day. Like I say, if you want a fun book on a not-so-fun subject get it. If you are looking for investigative research to be taken seriously, don't even bother."
1,This is not supposed to be a work of fiction.,Jim Marrs writes a very interesting story of an assassination of a handsome popular President that is done by the government and framed on a young average American male. The fact that any of this is construed as what actually happened in the assassination of Kennedy is laughable. It's an good story when framed in the light that it is a creative work of fiction.
1,A book that was worse than the movie.,"I purchased this book as part of a graduate school course in history. Though centered on the JFK assassination, the course dealt with how historians are to use evidence to reach logical conclusions. Marrs' book is an example how not to infere evidence. Marrs often takes incredible leaps of fantasy to declare the presence of a conspiracy or manufactures out right lies to present his case. Marrs using various theories to attempt to disprove the Warren Commission findings that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin. But Marrs knowingly presents half-truths and omits critical parts of witness testimony and forensic evidence. ""Crossfire"" is one of many books that trumpet the presence of a conspiracy of government officials and mobsters to kill President Kennedy; like the others, Marrs' work is no better than a supermarket tabloid. If you must read this book, you should also read Posner's ""Case Closed"", a reasonable counter to Marrs' wild allegations."
3,Bland,I bought this in bulk (unfortunately). My gravy at home is not gluten free and I have been looking for a quicker way to make gravy for my son. This is very very bland and you have to really flavour it up so there are no time advantages with it. I now use my home base and thicken my sons with corn starch!I don't want to grade this product too low because I do appreciate companys making Gluten Free products!
1,Worst Physical chemistry book ever,"The author use excessively long sentences, thinking that may help explaining things, but actually make it worse. 80 % of the students in the class claim that they know less after reading it. THe other 20% didn't use this book because they either give up or they are so smart to use other books. There are sentences that I read more than 30 times and got confused more progressively.another e.g. THe author use delta F and dealta G without explaining the difference. It is an total frustration.Compare other physical chemistry before you buy this one.90% of all others are better.A good one would be :Physical Chemistry: With Applications to the Life Sciencesby David S. Eisenberg, Donald M. Crothers (Contributor)"
1,This book is awful,"This is a horrible book, possibly the worst Chemistry book I have ever had. The book is written in confusing, disconnected, language that is not geared toward the student, but rather to Levine's Ph.D collegues. Levine never gets to the point. Important concepts and ideas are drowned in needless jargon and text. I spent more time ""hunting"" for the important information rather than studying. In fact, there is so much useless material it is hard to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant. It made for a very miserable Physical Chemistry course, and I actually learned more when I stopped reading the book and just worked a lot of problems. To any professors or students who are considering this book, I would recommend to stay far away from it, because it basically ...."
4,a few steps away from greatness,"This film teams Fu Sheng and Ti Lung with both playing somewhat not so good guy roles the character to watch is the villian who fights with a halbred. The fight between him and Ti Lung early inthis film on a darken street is a classic, Fu Sheng does'nt really do much heavy duty fighting in this film but adds comedy to help the story along. I only gave this film 4 stars because the plot was the build up to this character and Ti Lungs second comfortation with not much action in between all the way to the end. Well worth adding to any serious martial art film collection."
1,Worst Children's Show Ever,"This has got to be the dumbest show ever. The kids are so stupid, they dance like ... and arent much better at singing.The premise of the show is utterly moronic. The kids go to a computer type in a special word and then they fly on a computer chip to the land of Hi-Yah. In the land of Hi-Yah Kanga Roddy lectures them on how when he prepares for a Kung Fu match, he uses virtue.There is also this one kid who is the bully of the cast. Everytime they want to make an example of someone, they use him. Thats a wonderful lesson for your kids, make examples of the stupid.How did Ronnie Lott and Joe Montana get dragged in to this piece of .... I would divorce my wife if she proposed a show like this.By the way, Amy (other reviewer), are you crazy, I can almost understand your kids enjoying this, but you too. Thats a real shame. How can you like this muck ?WORST CHILDREN'S SHOW EVER"
3,"""To Washington"" ruined it","I listened to this album on Rhapsody a few months ago. I had never heard any of these songs before, so I thought JM's covers of them were great, especially ""Johnny Hart"", ""The End of the World"", and ""Baltimore Oriole"". But then, ""To Washington"" played. Before I heard that song, I was considering buying the album; not anymore. I hate when celebrities put their left wing garbage into their music and movies. Now I will admit I'm a political junkie, but I look to music and movies so I can temporarily forget all the problems in the world; this kind of stuff ruins them for me. I doubt you will ever stumble across this, but please, John Mellencamp: if you want me to buy your music, keep your politics out of it. (If you're some other famous musician, the same goes for you, too.) Thank you."
4,Americana From Mr. Mellencamp,"John Mellencamp is a favorite of mine. If you go back and listen to his recordings chronologically, you can hear the growth from a hard edged rock and roller to a singer/songwriter of depth and feeling. I knew that this release would be fitting, since John has been heading in this direction. He is after all a songwriter of Americana now, and this collection of roots music is fully him.My favorite though, hands down, is his yearning 'The End of the World,' the old Skeeter Davis tear-jerker. His straight-forward and raw approach, sans even the song's beautiful harmony vocal, is just gorgeous and heart wrenching. The cd would be worth having just for that song alone, but there's another half dozen great songs here. If you're a fan of American Roots music, and not too big on John, you'll still find very much to enjoy here. If, like me, Mellencamp is an American Music staple, you'll love it."
1,Inept Mellencamp Mangles the Blues,"Why the hell would anyone listen to Mellencamp's sorry attempt to sing ""Stones in My Passway"" when they can listen to Robert Johnson? Or to Son House, or Howlin' Wolf or any of the other blues aces whose songs are horribly mangled by this inept Hoosier. A slap in the face to the real blues and a pitiful attempt to cash in on the roots music craze."
1,Complete Garbage,Complete Garbage - Invest your $$ in an original Mellencamp album - you will be dissapointed with this weak effort
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!,"Hey, I read all of the Forbidden Doors by Bill Myers. I wish he would put out more. They all were just great. Bill Myers has become one of my favorite authors. I suggest that you read all of his books because they are all good. Once you start reading his books you just can't stop."
4,As advertised,"No problems with this purchase. This little lamp chimney was just as advertised, well packed, and promptly shipped."
4,This is a perfect book to read over the summer.,"Sheila is a person who is very worried about how she is perceived by other people. She is unsure of herself, and when she doesn't know something, she tells white lies instead of just admitting it. When her family goes to upstate New York for the summer, Sheila is confronted with her fears of dogs and swimming, and in making new friends she must deal with her worries about herself. You may already be familliar with Sheila from the ""Fudge"" stories, but this book paints a more in depth, endearing picture of her. As always, Judy Blume uses humor to portray situations that might not be so funny were we in them ourselves."
3,Awesome,This was a very interesting and juicy story. I'm reading the fudge series and this one is different because it's written in Shelia's point of view. I personally think it makes it better.
5,A romantic treat for the holidays,"I kept hearing this voice through wonderful and familiar holiday songs several years ago, but I could only find Laura Taylor and the album's availability by going into her website. Now she's available through Amazon and what a treat this very simple and lovely and romantic album is! Accompanied only by guitar, she brings the holidays to life and light, somewhat as Doris Day did with her wonderful holiday album from back in the 60's. Laura may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the songs she has chosen to sing, all of them very familiar, surround the listener with a warmth and quiet that is perfect for this time of the year. Give her a listen...you won't be disappointed."
4,AR-15 mag pouch,Works as advertised and attaches easily. Magazine pretty much stays in place. Make sure callapsiblele stock is fully extended otherwise spare magazine interferes with charging handle.
5,Perfect,"This is such a simple, yet fantastic item! My son loves card games but can't hold all the cards he needs to in his small hands. This is a great item!!"
4,Inconsistencies,I really enjoyed the book but Tanner had blue eyes for the first half of the book and brown for the second half. Maybe it's just a typo in the kindle version
3,Don't move!,"While this player played CDs well, and the FM radio works great, it is noisy as it sets itself to play the CD. Also, don't try jogging with it, or using an elliptical machine with it resting on the machine, because it will skip. I even had it skip on me when I was simply walking and carrying it in my hand. It is a perfectly fine player if you are just sitting around listening to music or books, but if you move around much, you may not be happy with this player."
2,Rushed?,"While the combat footage and commentaries are good, Disk 1 of this set had the sound for the Battle of Crete on the Battle for Burma, which was less than amusing. My presumption is that this set was rushed into production and someone didn't check the disk for errors such as this. As the Battle for Crete is on the next set, I am curious as to whether the Burma soundtrack is to be found in that set...."
1,Big named songs are remakes,"Later in his career Charley Pride did a massive recording session where he re-recorded all his biggest hits.At the time it was well intentioned because almost all of the original versions of these songs were unavailable.But be forewarned, the songs on this disc are all remakes."
5,Excellent product.,"My husband is Celiac, and I've been changing all the ""normal"" recipes that I have for gluten free recipes, including cakes, cookies and bread. I've tried this flour to subsitute regular self raising wheat flour and it has given me excellent results. I even made Panettone for las Christmas!!! I recommend it very much."
2,Boyz as Bratz?,"I couldn't understand why at first, these dolls were even made, and I have to admit I didn't like them. However, they've grown on me and I must say, Cameron is pretty cool. He looks like a mini magazine model in his Hawaiian shirt (very ""in"" this year) plus the extra muscle tee and khaki shorts are very stylin'. I'd reccomended the ""Boyz"" as a separate collectable; not sure I'd include him on the same shelf as the girls, though."
3,"Good concept, uneven delivery","I thought that the book did a good job capturing what is going on with 5 year old boys. However, I often found myself stumbling over the words as I read (forcing the rhymes), which took away from the flow of the story."
2,Harder to Read This Book,"I wasn't impressed. Seemed like Curtis listed far more reasons why five is yukky than why its fun. Bought the book for my niece, read through it before I gifted it to her. Was very disappointed."
1,BOARING.,"This is probably the worst 2D sidescrolling game ever. the graphics stink and the game play is SOOO boaring. it is one of those games you get because your a fan of the series, play it once and never play it again. how do I know this? I played the demo at toys R us...."
1,waste of time,"the graphics made me nauseaus, one of the worst games I ever bought, thank goodness it was on sale."
5,Lovely,"A romance with heart! The hero and heroine are an unlikely pair that find love growing in rocky ground. From different backgrounds, with age against them and virtually everyone against them, this pair finds that love really does make life a wonderful place to be. The hero realizes that duty is not all life has to offer him and the heroine realizes the heart has no rhyme or reason but loves the one it loves, list or no. Reaffirms the human condition with grace and poise. Well written Ms. Kelly, keep them coming."
4,Tina Dico,"Tina Dico is the latest newcoming singer to grace the stage with Zero7, the quintesential chill band from the U.K. If you have heard them, you have to love the ""smoove"" as silk grooves music, and Tina is a singer with vocal range that is simply over the top as witnessed on the Z7 track ""Home"". The new mini album from Tina, a Danish grammy winning singer, is solid and burns with her passion for the music and vocals. Europe is comparing her to Joni Mitchell in her heyday. I don't do those comparisons,so let me just say sample a track from Far at Tina Dico dot com and you'll be buying this album."
1,A walk through the woods...,"This is the harrowing tale of three people walking through the woods. I'm not kidding, thats it. I suppose if I was to get more detailed in my description its actually the harrowing tale of a fat guy with a bag over his head that abducts two tattooed barflys and then they all walk through the woods. At one point they stop and the fat guy takes a dump. Then they all drink some whiskey and they are back on their way. Walking through the woods..."
1,how not to stretch a short,"Take the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes, drop the long walk through the woods, the shaky hand held camera and the low budget special effects and at least you have a somewhat coherent story. However, we are tortured for an extra hour with scenes of a guy with a sack over his head escorting his captives through the woods for some unknown nefarious reason to things we're really better off not seeing or are of no interest whatsoever. If you could watch it for cheap with a fast forward capability, that would be your only salvation and my only recommendation."
4,Pub in your house,"This table completes your pub look in your home as I did. It is the right height for the matching pub chairs, see my other reviews. I believe this is a fine piece of furniture."
5,GREAT Greatest Hits---Rick Nelson!!!!,I ordered the Rick Nelson Greatest Hits CD and I absolutely love it!!! I ride around in my convertible and listen to it all the time!! I had a different Greatest Hits CD but it wasn't as good as this one!!! This one has Fools Rush In AND Garden Party!!! Not to mention some of the tracks have James Burton on guitar....he was a master! He played for Elvis too! Great Greatest Hits CD!!!!
5,Great Winter Patrol Socks,"I am a police officer and I purchased these socks for cold winter nights. Any police officer who has been stuck on a perimeter knows what it is like to stand still for hours on end in a back yard at 2 am in winter. I've worn these socks with Danner patrol boots so I assume the combination of the two is what has kept my feet so warm. Regardless, they are all I will ever purchase now.PROS:Very warmComfortable and thickCONS:Holes after 1 year (for 7 bucks each who cares)Tend to smell after the night is over"
1,Poor Quality,"These will keep your feet warm for one wear, and then holes in the bottom. I didn't have these a month and they started getting worn on the heels and balls of the feet. Now they have gapping holes (we got them at Christmas), and they are headed to the garbage. We both 2 pairs and both are the same. Don't waste your money, surely there are warm socks out there that can also last more than a month."
2,40 Below? Not!,"No significant temperature difference for my feet than any other ""warm"" sock. Sock is not very thick or cushioned but is very soft. Almost to the point of being useless for boots as they tend to slip down into the shoe. Very disappointed as I have other Wigwam socks that I love. One pair has lasted about 10 years. Hope at least I get longevity out of this pair."
2,Will probably send them back,"I wore one pair before washing (I bought four pair) and they were REALLY warm, but I wore the same pair AFTER washing and they were no warmer than regular socks. I was looking for REALLY WARM SOCKS, so I guess I'll keep looking."
4,great socks for hubby,"Watch out! Nowhere does this ad say these are men's socks, so wearing a size 10 women's shoe, I ordered an XL. When they arrived, I realized I had just bought my husband a very nice pair of snowblowing socks."
3,You'll need bigger shoes,"Very good and very thick wool sock. Not very fitted but nice and toasty. You might need to break out a bigger shoe for this one if you haven't already bought boots a little larger for winter. Good sock, don't know how long it will last but I'll find out by the end of winter. Don't know if it lives up to it's name but I really don't want to find out either. I would recommend as a knee/boot sock. Probably good for stationary activities like hunting(tree stand), sledding, maybe even skiing, etc."
4,I'm sticking to their silk and wool,I tried them all. the wigwam silk and wool are the best. I don't think these were any warmer but maybe worse cause my feet sweat in them.
3,Hair Rollers,"The hair rollers work excellent at curling my hair. My only peeve with this product is how cheaply the cover is attached.At day 2 the top lid came loose and dropped off. The plastic parts that are to hold it together, don't."
4,"A to Z of French Food, French to English Dictionary",This book has been to France 5 times with me or my friends and resides there now with a neice who has just moved to Provence. It is invaluable in deciphering menus and helping you order what you want to eat ..... no surprises. Wouldn't travel without it and small enough to stash in a pocketbook or a mans inside breast pocket. The only thing better would to be fluent in French!
1,what a joke,"I cannot believe this tomb made it to publication. The copy I purchased was shrink wrapped and looked promising. Good thing for Mr. Dammann I could not see before I bought the parade of mistakes, poor spelling, (Camero?) and complete lack of useful information. What was the purpose of this book?What a train wreck."
5,Watch this! It could save your life!,"A thought-provoking video that will enlighten and inform you of what is causing most disease. You will feel empowered to help others and change your own eating habits. Big business is preventing us from knowing the truth and this video surely takes you to a new level of understanding. Watch it. Let your family and friends know about it. The more people who know about this, the better off society will be overall.Watch this video too. It goes hand in hand with Eating and has even more information you'll want to know about.Forks Over Knives"
3,Life changing,"Since switching to the plant-based diet advocated by the ""Eating"" DVD and ""RAVE Diet"" book, I've lost over 11 pounds in less than a month. I estimate my actual compliance with the diet at 80-to-90%, depending on the day. As time moves forward, I find more ways to comply with the RAVE guidelines.I have experienced several periods of ""detoxification"" (your body does this naturally as those vegetables go through you!) with accompanying low energy. This lasts maybe a day or two, then I feel much better than before.Whereas I walked sporadically before the diet, I now walk 1-to-4 miles every day, simply because I feel better.The DVD needs a Scene Selection option, but other than that it offers excellent value for the money. The first part of the DVD explains how animal-based diets are killing you; the second part explains how animal-based diets are destroying the planet. It's an eye-opener."
3,Nude Nostalgia,"When I was a little boy I found my dad's Playboy issue where Jayne Mansfield appeared nude in a pictorial about a movie she was filming. The title was ""Promises, Promises"" and it never played here, in Mexico, due to censorship. The memory stayed within me and now, quite older, I could get the film and notice that it's a low budget comedy that exploited Mansfield's sex appeal and her magnificent body. Nothing much to it, except that it brings back memories about an era where we were nave. It's fun and one gets to see a female legend of the fifties."
5,For all of you complainers of the fact it's not the version,"For all of you complainers of the fact it's not the version you had back in the 80's I know of a website that will straiten you up. There were 5 versions of the ablum made, and many of the songs have even 13 versions of the songs, only 1 song from the album is the same no matter which version you have or had for it is the only song that has 1 version that song is Last Chance On The Stairway. (...)By the way stop your bitching about the album I have the US 1st version I LP, I have The US 3rd version on cd..with bonus tracks, the remasterd cd, plus I only the 81>85 box set, Night Versions, and Strange Behaviour, plus Decade, and Greatest, plus Decade on VHS and Greatest on DVD..so I have many versions of the songs, not all...I consider all versions to be a goal for me to have...so..read about the different versions before you complain!"
1,They blew it again!,"When I first bought this album in 1983, it had an excellent 5:20 version of ""Hungry Like the Wolf"", the highlight of the whole album (next to the title track). When the first CD of ""Rio"" came out, ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" was much shorter (like they wanted to hurry up and get it over with). This shorter version killed the appeal of the whole CD for me. I hoped someday they would re-release ""Rio"" as ""the original vinyl version."" I thought that day came this past July 3rd, 2001. I was let down again. The same short version of ""Hungry Like the Wolf"", but now remastered. Sad! Would anyone like to take this lame CD off my hands AGAIN? Never mind, I'll go trade it for something else somewhere. The closest we're going to get to the original vinyl version of ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" is on the ""Night Versions"" collection. Not exactly the same, but close. Since Capitol created this confusion back then, why didn't they just feature the alternate tracks as ""bonus tracks"" to make everyone happy?"
1,"Indeed, this record is not what you think it is","Other reviewers have correctly pointed out that this CD was made from the original UK release, not the version remixed by David Kershenbaum that was released later in the US, and that most US listeners consider to be the ""official"" release.Even casual listeners will notice the differences. I know that some folks will always say that the original versions are better by virtue of being first, but in this case, I think the record company got it right --- the US mixes are considerably more punchy and poppy. The UK mixes are comparatively dull-edged.Unfortunately, the only way to hear the US mix of Rio is to get a vinyl copy (they are widely available wherever used vinyl is sold)This seems like such a comical oversight in an era where every remix, alternate version etc is available on CD somewhere. Some lawyer must have screwed up in 1982 and nobody has the rights to the US version. Or something."
3,Periodontal Surgery: A Clinical Atlas,"The volume arrived in perfect condition. The large and well-spaced format promised clear illustration and sequencing of procedures, which was mostly,but not always, the case. A number of procedures had quite complex suturing involved, which was only shown when completed, not during the suturing, and this I found quite a let down.Overall, the Atlas describes, with the aid of great photographs, a variety of periodontal surgical procedures, but does not always provide the desired detail in all aspects of the procedure."
3,Newbie,I bought the book to help my post-baby frumpiness. After reading the book I think it would have been a fabulous read before I got married. It's a great introduction to seduction and very informative -- but if I tried to bring a feather duster into the bedroom my husband would explode into laughter.
5,This book is a must get- absolutely hilarious!,"You know how they say you'll live an extra year each time you laugh? If that statement is true, one who reads this book will never die! This humorous book will have you laughing on end. If you're looking for a chuckle, you have got to check out ""No Sleeping On Pavement."""
3,it's ok,"i think the conditioner is ok, but it makes my hair feel slightly hard. i do like the scent though."
2,Drying,"I loved the smell of this product, but it dried my hair out :(It did not condition or detangle my hair. What a bummer - the scent is a keep though."
1,Big waste of Money if I could enter Zero stars I would,"I have hair to my lower back and always need detangler and lots of conditioner. I saw this and thought I would give it a try...BIG mistake, what a freaking mess this made my hair I couldn't even get a wide tooth comb through. It was worse then when I use my normal product, and it made my hair seem like it was really crispy and dry. My husband said it made my hair feel like straw, he loved the smell of the product but it is extremely drying, by the time I had finished combing my hair my hair was one big frizz ball with broken snapped ends. Two hours later I actually got my hairbrush stuck in my hair which has never happened before, it was like I had put stuff on my hair to tangle it instead of untangle. I washed it out and my hair clearly had alot of damage from this product...it almost felt like hairspray on my head. I wish I could get my money back. I will go back to my regular product!"
4,Nice smell; Light spray,"I have found that with Carol's Daughter products, I really like some and really dislike others. I really like the Black Vanilla conditioner. It moisturizes my hair, but doesn't weigh it down. I also like the smell of it (unlike Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner), which is important to me. I think of a leave in conditioner as similar to a facial moisturizer. It's good to use daily to keep the hair moist."
1,Scented WATER!!!!,"This stuff is horrible. If it cost $1, I still wouldn't buy it. The smell isnt even all that great. It literally feels like you're spraying your hair with vanilla water. I felt no conditioning agents in my hair, no softness, or no slip. It's just blah! Totally not worth purchasing. I've tried several carol daughter products, hated all of them!"
3,Too expensive on amazon. Product is Good but not GREAT.,"**UPDATE**I cant beleive the price of this on amazon is now over $20, when I bought it earlier this year it was $12 and its currently $11 on the carols daughter website. Amazon prime is sometimes such a rip off!***ORIGINAL REVIEW***I like the smell of this, but I was a bit dissappointed after hearing and reading such raving reviews about carols daughter. It is a nice but lightweight leave in conditioner that moistens the hair and makes it a bit soft but its no better than lusters s curl activator or kinky curly knot today leave in. Its just so lightweight that its barely there and if you have kinky hair this product wont make much impact on its own, you have to spray it on after using a heavier activator or leave in"
1,It's the pits....,"Straight up, it's not worth the money. Not only is it clumsy to play, but it's incredibly boring. There are plenty much more exciting games to spend your money on. I can't believe ANYONE could find ANYTHING interesting in this game."
3,Kinda boring,"This game looked interesting but its really kinda boring. Although its not awful like Metal Bots or anything like that, and this is why I gave it 3 stars. Some may like this game. I do not hate it, I just find it kinda boring and repetious."
2,Youth League Baseball Pitching,I recently received this video and find that the content is really based for a child just entering a pitching league. It will show you some of the real basics about the approach to pitching and some of the basic drills that are repeated in just about every video and/or book I have seen. I found the video on Pitching mechanics by Tom House more helpful with some real problems shown and solutions addressed.
5,Love this!,"We love this! I originally bought this for my husband's ""beer bottles"" so when he's in the ""man cave"" he can have one chilling while he's drinking one. But we will also use it for our wine bottles as well. He tried it last night for his beer bottle and LOVES it! He puts the beer back in the cooler between each drink. Great gift!"
3,Vacu Vin,"I bought two - one for red and one for white. They don't make a warm bottle cold - just cool, but they do keep cold wine cold."
5,Excellent,"I had forgotten how great the sound of Moe Bandy was and is. It has been a very long time since I have heard any of his songs. Thanks to Amazon. com, I am able to relive these great songs. It's sad that the artists of today have turned country music into country rock. Hats off to Moe Bandy."
1,The Hidden Game,"When I first got this game it looked soooo cool because of the box.If they had let me test it or something in the store, then I would have turned it down right then. The graphics are pretty good but the rest of the game is REALLY bad.You can't even see what you are shooting at!? so, as a last word DON'T buy IRIDON 3D!!!!..."
2,barely ok game,"I bought this for my import system a week ago because it was the only thing on the shelves. At first the sound and graphics look beyond any other handheld game around, but after a while I realise the game is very cheaply done, and the game skips with many sprites on the screen. With out the the scaling and fancy background movie that loops through out the game you end up with a point and click sort of game ends up flat. Its an ok launch title thats a little like Star Fox thats been hit with a hammer."
1,"Great Graphics, Terrible Game","Iridion 3D proves that cliches from the PC market can and will writhe their way into the console world. Iridion 3D sports top of the line, beautiful graphics, but unfortunately the gameplay just isn't enough to keep you entertained. It's fun for one level, but afterwards you'll be wishing you had spent your money on better games, like F-Zero or the fantastic Tony Hawk 2."
1,This Game not very good,"I own this game and I wish i didn't. After you play it for an hour its sooooooooo boreing! you only get 1 ship, and the graphics are horible! If you want a good game thats similar, get F zero, its so much better.Peace out"
5,Love it,I bought this cook book for my boss who loves cuban cooking and food .... I think she has made all the recipes
2,Essential Ironman Vol. 1,"Just got this book and man am I disappointed! Oh, it's thick enough, lots of content. And the graphics are clear, and its dimensions are nice. But... I expected it to be all in color like the original comic issues, but only the COVER was in color! 600 pages of comic issues in black & white?!! This sucks! What was the stupid publisher thinking?! Reading comic books starring superheroes should be seen in their colorful costumes,. Seeing Ironman not in gold and red, or the hulk not in green but in sepia tones sucks!!!!!!!! I am hugely disappointed."
5,This is a good game,Hi all fans of game boy advance this game is without a doubt a good game and in my opinion the best game for game boy advance theres over 50 throws and practicly the same thing from the classic game for nintendo super dodgeball witch is a good game so i urge all fans to get this game you will love it
2,Not too Good..........,despite other reviews this game isnt so grreat.i mean all you do in the gamee is pres A every once in a while.its charming for a trip but you will get tired of it real soon.Graphics-7 Control-10 (what do you expect) Sound-6 Replayibility-4 Overall-6
2,Too Simplistic,"I found myself playing this game without any real effort or time investment, and finished it within 3 days. It's a cute concept, and might be a good two player game, but as a stand alone it's not worth the price. You just repeat the same strategies: Catch the ball, Super Throw back, repeat. Yes, I know that's the concept of dodge ball, but the challenge was not there."
3,Great Graphics but great game? Maybe not.,"The graphics on this may look stunning and you may be concealed with getting this game because of that,but it isn't really all that fun. I mean,you catch the ball and press A. Is that really all that fun?"
4,Careful when installing,"The provided straight edge screws are prone to slippage when installing, which results in a deep mar of the surface. The color is beautiful. Just take care with your screwdriver."
2,Light duty constructtion,"For the price of this feeder I was expecting at least medium duty construction. This feeder is not very sturdy at all. The bottom is not braced or reinforced which is the main problem. If that was done, the light duty construction for the rest would be okay. I have this feeder in with goats and my guardian dog, and feel it's not going to hold up that well. The feeder arrived with a bent bottom, and the seller was very fair in issuing me a partial refund, but the design needs to be tweeked for the bottom."
1,Never got book,I never got the book. It was sent to the deadletter office. I e-mailed the company I brought it from and theydid not even try to help me. Can anyone help me get my book.
2,Too long and tedious,"This book was much too long and included excrutiatingly detailed treatments of the politics of the law enforcement agencies involved. It was very tedious and I found myself skipping over paragraphs to find interesting material. This book is more of a treatment of how agencies and personalities work to solve murder cases than it is a gripping treatment of the murders themselves. I would have to say that the book is actually rather boring. Don't let me have too much influence over you, as it is clear that many other reviewers loved the book."
3,"Should be called Texas Smokin' Steak N Cheese Sticks, or something","When you bite into this cheesy treat, you will think that you are in Philadelphia!This is not true. We don't have anything like this in Philadelphia. Do not confuse this product with anything Philadelphia. I'm not saying it's a bad product - but lets be honest here: The describer is alluding that this product tastes like a Philly Cheesesteak, which I can most certainly tell you without even trying it that it does not (the first three ingredients in this are Beef, Beef Hearts, and Cheese Powder.) No self-respecting Philadelphian would go near this product. Secondly, the founder is a fourth-generation Texas cattle rancher. There is nothing Philadelphian about that. Nope. Sorry."
4,Mini Co-Sleeper,We love the co-sleeper. The size is perfect for our bedroom and has been great for traveling or taking with us to family events. We store toys in the bottom zip compartment. The only problem is we are unable to connect it to our bed. We have a large sleigh bed with decorative molding around the bottom of the mattress so the co-sleeper could not sit close enough to the bed. We put it against the wall accross from the bed which still keeps baby close.
2,"poor magazine.. Biased editing, get rich quick schemes and nothing but franchises to offer","this magazine is very biased in a few companies (Apple, for example). It is only useful as an advertisement for franchises and has very little to offer in terms of ideas, Point of views, problems, solutions etc.. This magazine would not help you if you are looking to START a business.. only if you are looking to BUY one, such as the many franchises they constantly push.. Franchises are very difficult to ""break even"" with, and have unnecessary costs, so I avoid those altogether, but this magazine seems to have only one or two interesting and educational articles per annum. Go with Money magazine instead, it is leaps and bounds ahead of this excuse for a read."
2,Nothing useful here,"As a student of entrepreneurship and a practicing entrepreneur, I had high hopes for this magazine. I'm in the middle of a 1 year subscription but have honestly yet to take away anything useful from this magazine. Reading the articles makes me question if any of the writers have ever been entrepreneurs themselves.Each issue also contains an article with ""tips"" from the ""Esquire Guy,"" which is usually full of tripe targeted towards cubicle dwellers. As an entrepreneur, I find these articles offensive to those who have shunned the 9-5.The other characteristic I find useless about this magazine is the persistent stream of topical articles about guys who have developed some random smartphone app. These apps are never practical to business owners and the articles are snoozers.I honestly wish this magazine would improve and publish more useful information since it has become one of the de-facto representatives of entrepreneurs to the outside world."
2,To keep you hoping.,"This magazine is great just for keeping the spirit. It's filled with many success stories. But hardly any of those success stories include the details that led them into success. It's also extremely geared towards franchising. Every other article, and every other ad is about franchising. I have a one year subscription and at this point I'm bored. I'll keep the subscription, but it's highly unlikely that I will renew next year.*** Though one should check out their web site at entrepreneur.com. You will find that it is the total opposite of the magazine, and will prove to be a great wealth of information."
3,Not enough quality content.,"Entrepreneur magazine contains far too many advertisements and articles that read like advertisements to be a regular read. I only read this magazine when there no other business magazine choices available, or if I'm killing time at an airport. Choose Inc. magazine if you want a great magazine for entrepreneurs!"
2,Still Not Here,I love this magazine that's why I ordered it six weeks ago... Still hasn't arrived. Hopefully I will get this upcoming months issue.
1,Cardboard,"These taste like cardboard. These are the worst. I can't give them away. Here is a better low carb snack option:Planters Deluxe Whole Cashews with Pure Sea Salt, 2 lb Units, (Pack of 2)"
4,A good product!,"This is like a good flavored pig rinds but better, I love them and have reordered already."
3,really really salty,"This prduct was ""tasty"", but incredibly salty (and I don't mind salt). Bottom line: if you are on a sodium restricted diet, stay away."
1,"Very simple game, after an hour you have done it all","Very simple building of a tetris castle. Biggest challenge is determining what shape is falling after your castle gets higher and the piece is hidden behind the score. Graphics are very simple, music also simple. After an hour of playing you've seen it all. Nearly all Atari 2600 games have more complexity and game play. The L and R buttons are reversed, you push the R button to scroll to the left."
4,Good Product,"The LED isn't as brite. Would prefer a hard wired voltage light instead. The batteries get weak if they are left on incidently over night. It feels good as a shifter, but you have to tighten the screw when the weather changes from hot to cold. Keep a tool in the car and you will be fine."
1,"An Effort With Heart, But Not Of Substance","I have always been intrigued by the story of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, and have looked forward to a book that provided both an accurate history of their criminal careers as well as a glimpse into who they were as people. Unfortunately, this is not a book I can recommend as meeting either of those requirements. It's clear that the author (actually, the co-author, as Clyde's late sister Marie is also credited) pursued this project with a good deal of heart. The greater is the pity, for this falls short as history, as criminology, or as a study of the two Depression era bandits. This book shows signs of being hastily produced; with greater time, it could have been a much better book."
2,Terribly Written!,"I wanted to like this book. It was written by family of Clyde, so I thought that it might have some interesting insight into the minds of the two notorious criminals. But the book skipped from event to event without going deeper into the whys AT ALL. I did not enjoy this book one tiny little bit. I thought the writing was stilted. I thought the story lacked emotion and didn't get us involved with the characters at all. There are MUCH better books on the subject out there!"
4,Great for the Value,"I had problems installing this product in my computer, but not because of the product itself. Make sure that your computer's on-board sound has a cd-audio expansion jack. Mine didn't, so I had to go buy a new sound card ($12). Not a big deal. Otherwise, the video quality on the screen is great... a bit grainy at full screen, but would be fine from across the room. You shouldn't sit that close to a full TV anyway (right mom?). This card is definitely worth every penny you'd pay for it. It's easy to install, easy to setup and the software is pretty much idiot proof. I think you would probably get a better picture from a more expensive card, but this is more than enough for the vast majority of users. Save the money unless you're a very picky person."
3,TV & FM Card,"It installed easy enough, the software was a mystery. Not very user friendly but after an hour spent in trial and error efforts was able to figure out most of it. The book was very skimpy. I've had trouble with the remote, one day it works, the next day it doesn't. I'm ready to send it back. The TV and FM parts work very well. The software is an issue again when you try to replay a recording. Why don't they just make it straight forward. And the control panel needs more attention too, low readability, controls confusing and placement when watching. Maybe it is a work in progress?"
1,Dave Barry's Money Secrets,"So boring it helped my insomnia. Big waste of $$.Thanks for letting my say this, Betty Olson"
3,Pretty good; could have been better,There's no doubt Dave Barry can be quite funny.I laughed so hard I cried at times reading this book.But some chapters were a bit dull.I suspect this book was a bit of a rush job...could have been better with more effort.Not worth the hardcover price.
3,Not the Best... By Any Means.,"Not the best graphics or controls. If you want a decent fighting game, look into Tekken Advance."
1,Chopin turned in his grave at the publication of this biography...,"As a Chopin fanatic, I have done a lot of reading about his life. ""Chopin's Funeral"" is a terrible portrayal of this composer's personality and life. Ms. Eisler turned Chopin into a whining fruitcake, when in reality he was quite the opposite. Also, Ms. Eisler credited several myths about Chopin as fact (such as his homosexuality, when there is no proof whatsoever that Chopin was gay). On top of all this, the book was incredibly dull and slow. I got 2/3 of the way through this book before I slammed it shut in disgust. If you want to read an interesting biography of Chopin that let's his true personality come through, read ""Chopin"" by George Richard Marek."
2,Disappointing,"I have read many biographies of Chopin, in addition to his letters, and found that there were many errors in this book. In the beginning of the book, Eisler presents a diminutive Chopin at 5', sitting on the piano next to the outgoing 6' tall Franz Liszt. Chopin was actually 5'7"", an average height at the time, while George Sand, his companion, was only 5'. That visual cue colors the rest of the biography, portraying Chopin as a tiny weakling who was dominated by George Sand. I also found that she editorializes more than the better biographies, adding her own bias in a ""creative"", way. While all biographers do this, they usually have better research to support their storyline."
2,Somewhat there,"This game is really tough in some cases, but it doesn't want you to play more and more. There are very few weapons in the game. A machine gun, short range missle, long range, cruise missle, and a tomahawk missle (the ones for blowing up stuff). There are only 21 levels in the game. I heard that the last one is like the first level, except with UFO'S! But it doesn't really meet up with it's expectation I thought it would be."
4,Fun Combat Flight Sim,This is a basic combat flight simulator. It is not an arcade style action game. Similar to the static simulators used at Naval Air Stations to train fighter pilots. This is a fun game to fill a few minutes of downtime and I keep a copy in my flight bag for just such moments.
2,OK,"What really smells about this game is the the fact that to save it you have to write down a really long password on a piece of paper and then type it all in the next time you want to play. And it's hard to steer the plane and you can easily crash into the sea without even noticing.I also don't like how every time you have to destroy a ship or refuel they turn it into a ""mission"". For example when early in the game you have to keep shooting at a ship until it sinks, but you have to be in a certain range on the map so when you enter the range the screen fades out and then in and your repositioned to face at the ship and when your done the same thing happens. It would have been much cooler if you could have just approached shot at it and turned around on your own.Probably the one thing that I like most about the game is if you miss the explosion it shows up on your little screen inside the cockpit or when you fire a missile."
4,A good conceptual extender,"I have been programming for many years in languages such as Assembler,C, C++ and Python. I found I had not many difficulties with getting the concepts of Assembler and C, but concerning C++ and Python there were many things in these languges which I was not able to use effectively, since I did not understand the concepts. That is where Simply Scheme is such a great book. It explains quickly and easily ideas such as recursion, vectors, trees and general symbolic programming. It also helps with terminology, giving names to things I had been doing for years, but had not defined.I would suggest this book as a great step to those who can doing many things in lower level languages, but want to extend their effeciency. I do not think I would ever use the Scheme language as such, but I will certainly use what I have learned in this book for my programming."
5,best $700-range miniDV camcorder on the market today!!!,"I tried JVC GRX5US (5MP and 3-CCD) and Sony DCR-HC96 (3.3MP CCD) and finally decided to buy this Panasonic PV-GS500 from Amazon. This is the best camcorder for the buck.The video quality is outstanding even though we tried it indoor in the evening. The control is very user-friendly. The lense (12x optical zoom) is made by Leica, the German lens specialist. This makes the world of difference. 5 Star for the camcorder, 10 star for Amazon.com's unmatchable price."
5,Bought this as a gift,"I bought this item as a gift for a friend that lost her copy of it in a fire. She played it through while I was visiting and my opinion is that it is a very good representation of NGDB. It captures the style of the band quite well. Overall, it is a great album showcasing a very talented group of musicians.The best part was the album was advertised as being in very good condition which was an understatement. It actually looked like it had just been opened for the first time and never played before! My friend was very happy with it."
2,Too country,"I gave this release only 2 stars because it de-emphasizes their best stuff. ""Jealousy"" is one of the best albums I have in my collection of 600+ albums. ""Fire In The Sky"" is an awesome song from that album. I really wish they would have released more stuff like this before they went back to hillbilly."
3,Good but room for improvements,"The gameplay is very good. Eventhough this could easily be a GBC game, it has good animations. The game should be a little more colorfull.Reasons to buy this game:- good animation- good gameplay- very nice featuresReasons not to buy this game:- not exactly colorful- bad graphicsI am not a medieval fan so I can not give this game five stars. Graphics are very important to me, and I know what the GBA is capaple of. There is lots of room for improvement in this game, but I did enjoy playing this. My suggestion is that you rent this game first, and then decide wether you like it or not.Put in the following names and start a new game to get the indicated cheatsCROSSBOW - Shooter Mode with more hearts, more weapon damage and use of Homing daggerDAGGER - Get Thief modeGRADIUS - Make Nathan StrongerFIREBALL - All trading cards with DSS menuThis is still a great game.I hope that this review was helpful to you!"
4,Another Great Castlevania - Highly Recommended,"Circle of the Moon was the reason I bought a Gameboy Advance. I was not let down. Beautiful graphics and sound live up to the Castlevania reputation, while the gameplay provides quite a challenge at times. About as long as Symphony of the Night, and a lot harder, CotM has tremendous replay value. By beating the game you can unlock new play modes. And there is a Battle Arena with room after room of punishing monsters. The only downside to this game is the lack of lighting. Castlevania is a dark series, and this game's graphics live up to that. They're very good, but hard to see unless you have equally good lighting conditions. I imagine this looks absolutely gorgeous on a Gameboy Advance SP."
3,An enjoyable game,"This was my first GBA title. I purchased it in April 2002 and pretty much became bored with it. I personally missed the straight forwardness of the earlier Castlevania titles (that is to say I didn't care for the DSS cards). If I want to play an RPG I play Golden Sun (5 stars), if I want to play Metroid, I play Metroid Fusion (5 stars). When I want Castlevania, I want old-school whipping action.I played it, enjoyed it, and traded it back in at EB for credit towards The Two Towers (also 5 stars).you'll get plenty of good use out of it."
2,This might have been a good game...,If only you could see something. The Graphics are so dark it is absolutley impossible to play.
3,GOOD LAUNCH GAME......,"....but the game is waaaaaay too dark. Ya basically have to either (a) sit on the surface of the sun to see the game, or (b) sit outside while playing it. The game is very challenging which is good, but it gets frustrating when you cant find where to go. Great sound effects, good graphics, it feels like you are playing a super nes game. Overall a good game that could have been improved a little bit."
3,Grainy & Edited shows! Disappointed fan!,"***** for the shows themselves, but only *** for the DVD presentation. These are the same film transfers that were done over 20 years ago, they are not re-mastered. You will see film grain, scratch lines, and dirt specks.Even worse, it looks like Alfred Hitchcock's closings have been edited. He used to come out at the end of the story to wrap it up and make a remark about the upcoming commercial. After the break he would come back to say his goodbys and the credits would slide in. The few episodes I sampled seem to have the pre-commercial appearance after the story EDITED OUT or combined into the next appearance.""BOO HISS"" Alfred would say about this."
4,3 Double discs - confirmation,"Just to confirm what a prior reviewer assumed - these 3 discs are double sided and it can be fairly annoying to press the button to release the discs out of their case. I wouldn't be surprised if someone may accidentally break a disc.These discs make the prior releases of AHP discs outdated, such as those single discs that came with the old Hitchcock DVD sets from Universal.DVD quality is fairly good and I'm looking forward to 39 episodes with my favorite director."
2,Series Great--Quality Sucks,"I was so thrilled to learn that this series was coming out on DVD--I loved watching the episodes on tv--when they played.Once I received the discs, I wa disappointed as several episodes froze in the middle and would not restart. This happened on two different sets (as I exchanaged the original set for a replacement).If Universal is going to sell double sided discs, they really need to quality check somewhere down the line.Shame on you Univeral for putting such a poor product on the market."
4,Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season Three,"a fine collection of the master's TV anthology, notwithstanding the occasional editing out of the mid-show ""bumper""."
3,perplexing format,"Generally, the quality of the writing and directing is quite good. What is disappointing is the inexplicable way in which they indexed the shows. When you click on ""play episodes,"" only the first four of about 10 episodes are shown. If you didn't know any better, you'd assume there were only 4 on the disc. If you want to see the 5th or 6th episode, you must hit ""play all"" and skip through the unwanted episodes. It's a bit maddening."
5,terrific Targus PDA case,"I agree, this is a great PDA case - sturdy, durable, clean lines, Koskin has a nice feel in the hand, zipper keeps items inside safe and clean. I actually use the case to carry 2 portable external hard drives. Most PDA cases are too small for this use, but this Targus case is roomy and large enough for the hard drive and cable too. Targus make excellent products."
4,not enough bang in a book about a subject that is pure fire,although this book features great and at times candid photography it is handicapped by attempting to deal with a worldwide phenomenon (the hells angels mc) through the eyes of only its UK members...the angels though now global are a pure american institution...they could not have been founded anywhere else in the world with the same results...so it is unfortunant that such a wonderful idea as using unbiased photography to bring the club to life was used in such a limited capacity...the hamc deserves a massive work in this vein...any attempt to bring the angels to the general public without including at least a glimpse of its american roots stands only to leave a sense of unfinshed business in its wake...
3,Nothing to with sonny barger besides the intro,"Great book for what it is, but i was a bit decieved as Sonny Barger has nothing to do with this book except intro and 1 picture. Still Glad i got it, I recomend this book to anybody who wants to get an inside glimps at the UK Hells Angels and their bikes."
1,Pics of guys....ok.,"This book is simply a compilation of portaits, most taken in a studio of Hell's Angels from europe. It looks more like a reference of who's who for law enforcement. I was hoping for more action shots, more candid stuff of the Hell's Angels riding and hanging out. I don't really care for a head shot book...just boring. Don't waste your money unless you're buying my copy....."
4,a great game although lacking in track variety,"i must say that my first opinion of this game was that the graphics were very neat and the handling was easy.I think the main thing this game is lacking is that although there are 4 different championships to compete in, some of the tracks from different championships are put in a different championship(slightly altered) for you to race on it again. apart from this i think it is a great game. it has 8 characters and each character is stronger or weaker than others but it usually works out that the strong ones are slightly slower than the weak ones.The sound in this game is excellent with different themes for each track and some speech off the characters but not much. i would think that mario kart cicuit advance will be slightly better as the characters are slightly better know and the graphics will be improved(although this will be hard to do as the grapjics of this gam are very good.)"
4,Text-book like guide,"useful; accurate; yet in a plain, direct language; pity that the inside photos ( black and white; old )are so depressing;"
4,Turning Points Galore!,"Every scene should end in a turning point, REAL treatments are up to and beyond 90 pages, REAL writers work from the""inside out"" -- these are some of the revelations in store for readers of Story, a necessary addition for any serious writer (screenplay or otherwise). My gripes are that the book could've been more succinct -- a little less on the analytical rigamorale, and McKee DOES get some famous plot points and dialogue missed up, ex. -- that's ""Use the Force"" not ""Go with the Force"" and note the confusion over the inciting incident of Leaving Las Vegas [compare pages 198 & 307]. Despite these and other fumblings (Did Travis in Taxi Driver REALLY obsess on assasination and NOT Cybil Shepard before meeting Jodie? Did Vader ACTUALLY do and say things just that way in Empire Strikes Back?), the book remains a worthwhile venture. As McKee puts it so well: More than anything else -- before fancy dialogue or description, it's the STORY that matters."
5,The only book on writing you will ever need,"Heaven forbid this book ever be confined to the world of screenwriters. I have been reading 'writing' books for the last fifteen years, and probably 40 or so have been read cover to cover. This is THE book I was always looking for and never realised until i read it. It is written with such depth and unparalleled understanding of story that I have read it 3 times through, noting every chapter, highlighter in hand, just to absorb all of its mouthwatering lessons. Every facet of storytelling is demystified."
2,OVER RATED INAPPLICABLE,"An intellectual giant, as works of intellect go, but ultimately somewhat solopsistic. Ideas are thrown around but often without purchase. The chapter on substance never defines substance. As a writing tool, it leaves you wondering. How the hell do you negate a negation. A brilliant idea, but just how do you do it?This book is full of excellent notions, but they're developed for the lecture circuit, rather than the act of writing. It's a bloody good mind trip, worth a read, and definitely you should buy it. If you engage with the ideas, they will stretch you. But if you're looking for books that'll help you write, buy: Anatomy of a Screenplay and Jeff Kitchen's four tools of dramatic writing book.This book is a very dangerous book in the hand of development executives. Put in the cupboard with John Truby -- for writers only. No acolytes. Please."
3,Nothing Shocking,Jane's Addiction was one of those bands of the 90's who kind of changed my life. The book while entertaining and informative is a little difficult to read at times - this is due to the style. Snapshots of interviews collated over the history of the band. It concentrates on surface detail and facts and I personally would have loved more personal insight from the band. The last rock biography I had read was Slash - (GNR) whose autobiography did this very well. All in all though a great snapshot of the LA punk rock scene of the late 80's and early 90's.
4,Nice - lightweight but classic.,"These earrings are a great value, however the setting is too small for the stone and is a bit distorted. For the price, a good value. I wanted sparkle but not gaudy and these are the right size."
3,Cheep Fan,Fan bearings went out after about a year. I removed the cover so that the drive does not overheat and am now using it without the fan. Has been working great with HD TIVO.
5,Best case to buy!,"I have several external cases. This case is by far the best one, keeping your drive cool is essential for longevity and drive performance. Antec is known for keeping things cool. Drive installation was easy and only took a few minutes to do. I highly recommend this case!"
2,Not that great a deal,"It allows the drive to spin down, but is very slow to spin up.Noisey when it spins up, then is ok. The power connector is weak, falls out with the slightest movement of the case or cable . Once it is up, it does run fast."
1,Computer Could Not See the Hard Drive Inside the Case,"I experienced the same result as S. Feld (timerider), who also rated the case with one star.I tried two different HDD. The first was a Samsung HD103UJ, 1000GB/7200rpm/32M. The second was a Western Digital WD10EADS, 1000GB/SATA/32M, which just arrived from Amazon. I had the same results with both.The case goes back to Amazon."
4,Works great,"Works fine as expected with my DVR. It's not as quiet as I thought it would be, but I put it under a small shelf and now I can't hear it. No need to see it anyhow. The internal fan is worth it to extend the life of the drive. Works great with my 1TB WD green power drive.-Steve02-17-2009 - Case fan deteriorated and got very loud after about 1 year. This was unacceptable in a home theater and I had to replace it. Would drop the rating, but Amazon doesn't let me."
1,"Good Idea, poor execution","My backup drive needs to be on all the time, so forced cooling is required. This seemed like a good enclosure to use. However, I will be replacing the 2 that I bought very soon.1) The fan is EXTREMELY cheap and soon became noisy with a rattling sound. Unacceptable.2) They cleverly circulate the air around both sides of the drive for cooling, but the placement of the rear vent prevents you from stacking enclosures, so you would waste a ton of space if you had more than one. It would have been very easy to place the vent so you could stack them.3) The power switch is on the rear, instead of the front where you can easily access it. My drive is on a high shelf with the cables in the rear and it is very hard to find the switch when necessary.Sorry - this is a product FAIL."
2,"Great Service, okay video.",The service was great! But the video shows too much skin and too little fighting.
2,Save your money,"The girls are ugly, one scene of nudity that you don't want to see and the fights suck, buy Queen of the Hood if you want to see real, good, girl fights and skip this one."
1,i know they were inexpensive but the quality is terrible,"All I wanted was some extra reading glasses for around the house. I'm not that picky. But these were so cheaply made that the lenses would popping out just picking them up from the table. To make matters worse the frames are for a fairly small head. So, even though they look like glasses for a guy they probably wont fit well on a guy's head. I have never given one star review for anything on Amazon before, but I am sorry to say these glasses deserved it."
5,The Diamond Conspiracy,"OUTSTANDING! A thoroughly researched, fast-paced novel with intricately woven story lines. Kublicki's writing is sophisticated, educational and entertaining. I came into work bleary-eyed from staying up to read more. I can't wait for Kublicki's next work."
2,Not quite .,The book does not have color photographs. It is hard to identify a lot of similar looking birds that show up at our bird feeder and suet feeder. It has a lot of birds in it I will never see and that takes up a lot of room in the book. I would rather have a book the just includes birds in the southeast quarter of Michigan with color photographs.
3,Disappointing. The Soup was cold.,"I really wanted this to be a great experience like that of having lunch with Soupy and his characters on TV...but it just did not happen for me. Some wonderful anecdotes and historical commentary but a comprehensive autobiography, it was not. I felt like there was a lot missing...his personal life at home; two sons about whom we learn little (credits at the end he names only one of them).My sense is that there is alot of bad blood left in the wake of Soupy's personal and professional life: the difficulty with the corporate ""suits"" seemed to follow him throughout. There is no question about the genius of this man in his milieu, but I would be interested in hearing what the ""suits"" have to say about his intractabality...but THAT book will never be written. I would still like to see more of his videos but there are sadly few in distribution.P.S.(3/2008)There are Soupy clips all over YouTube! Go for it!"
4,Just Her Size...,"I bought this for my three year old daughter's birthday and it is just the right size for her petite hands. She immediately fell in love with this doll because of her bright colors and soft hair that she loves to comb. It came in a very pretty box, and was a really great buy for her. Well made too. Definitely worth the extra few dollars for this purchase."
1,The description of the movie is completely deceiving,The description of the movie is completely deceiving.If you are looking for a sexy vintage story. Don't waist your time.
5,Charming video,"Our family loves this whole series. Though there are some continuity problems, little kids don't notice this part. Both my 5 year old and toddler love Huckle and his friends and ask to watch the shows over and over. This story with the history of a tradition, we felt was not only fun but educational. The animation is also top-notch, as are most of the programs from CINAR."
4,Timex a winner!,My grandaughter received the watch for xmas and thinks its real cool_she is all of 7years old.she became aware of telling time and mastered it quickly! loves the INDIGO LITE too.Watch looks great and keeping perfect time.
2,Great Concept...broke within 24 hours,"The watch had a great concept and my daughter loved the design. She was able to quickly put her kindergarten level time telling skills to work. Sadly, the watch broke within 24 hours. The hands completely stopped moving. We tried to replace the battery but that didn't work. Not a very durable product which is sad because the concept of the watch makes it most appropriate for the Kindergarten to second grade level age child."
2,Cheap quality,"My daughter loves her watch. I am not to thrilled. It's not to the standard of other timex pieces. The band will easily fall off, it doesn't buckle. The plastic of the watch is thin and light. You can't see from the picture but the minute hand doesn't count off the 60 minutes it goes to 30 then backwards again. Kind of confuses the teaching method of skip counting by 5 for the minutes. Though she loves her big girl watch, it will not last long.I wouldn't recommend or buy another like this."
5,kids watch,"My granddaughter is learning to tell time and loves this watch! She loves that it says ""to"" and ""after"" on the face. She kept getting confused with that but now the watch tells her which it is."
2,Too personal.,"This was too personal to the author, and seemedpreachy. It will be a matter of taste if you enjoy it."
4,Good Faith Account of One Man's Journey,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
4,Good book for the curious New Ager also.,"Rabi's testimony about his discovery of the true God even while immersed in the Hindu community of Trinidad was quite interesting. Rabi walks the reader through his childhood as he becomes a guru. During the walk he points out the love and the desperation he experiences within the Hindu community he has grown up in. Then Rabi takes the reader through his sometimes terrifying conversion to Christianity as he discovers that faith in God can help to severe the bonds which have constrained his family. The book is not only good for the Hindu, but I found Rabi's story to also be helpful to those in Buddhist, New Age, or Universalist movements which so often make the mistake of assuming that every road leads to God and that a person has to shoulder the burden of their own salvation."
2,Useful For Smaller Breeds,"These pads were great for the first two weeks I was training my pitbull pup. After that at nine weeks old my pup's urine was not being held by these pads. These seem to be ideal for smaller breeds, so I can't understand why they show a Lab on the product. Though they work ok for all breeds during the first couple of weeks, I recommend these pads mainly for owners of smaller breeds."
2,Pads are small and leak,"The most important thing for a wee-wee pad is that it not let any liquid seep through and ruin the hardwood floors. This brand allows urine to seep through almost immediately. They are also slightly smaller than other brands we have used. Still looking for a brand that does not allow ANY seepage. This doesn't seem like much to ask, but so far all the brands we've tried allow leakage because the plastic is porous."
2,minimum protection puppy pads,"I tested these out with my very small mini dachshund. They didn't work out very well. While the size was big enough, the absorbent material was rather thin. These would protect your floor very well from the accidents of perhaps a hamster or a gerbil. If your puppy/dog weighs over 5 pounds, do not expect anything except a wet mess when you arrive home. I gave it 2 stars instead of one, because it would probably work pretty well for something tiny. (Smaller than the average grown rabbit that you see in your yard). Packaging was nice, and the pads do hold together, even when wet on both sides."
4,Very nice; but not for everday wear,"I purchased this piece and was pleasantly surprised. It was a nice size and weight. Not to mention it was for a good cause. I received many compliments on it. I will just add contrary to some other reviews, it is not for everyday wear. Mine in spots on the links have become very dull as if the finish came up. This piece would be great for special ocassions. Would recommend; but with that tid bit of info."
4,I LOVE it!,"I ordered this bracelet in early 2011 and fell in love when it was finally delivered! After almost two years it is still one of my favorite pieces of jewelry. I have small wrists so it fits me perfectly, and I get compliments on it all the time. The little crystals are still in place and have not fallen out."
2,not what I expected,I recieved this product and wasn't happy..It didn't look as nice as it did in the picture. It was very light and felt cheap.
2,INTERESTING KILLS ALMOST SAVE THIS HALLOWEEN HORROR FILM!,"After a promising opening set up, this film falls victim to horrible dialogue and bad acting. It's not a total loss though as I thought the murders in this film were much better than the usual fare and showed some sense of style. If the dialogue was better this could have been a pretty good little Halloween film, but decent gore sequences can only do so much. I do not expect grade A writing from these types of films, but when the dialogue takes away from the story, then it becomes a problem. Regardless, it is certainly a fun horror film for undiscriminating viewers and fans of oldf fashioned slasher films.."
3,Boring!!!!,This movie was sooooo boring. It started off with a lot of action. I thought it was going to be a keeper totally boring and not worth the money. I wish I would have gotten it used or something. It was so not worth the pricey price tag. Maybe half of the lowest used price.
4,Great addition to any techs tool box,"OTC is known as making quality equipment, and this tester is no exception. You can test your injectors at various pulse width settings and along with a fuel pressure gauge diagnose whether it is good or malfunctioning. It fits most injectors and for those that it doesn't fit, it comes with two leads that can plug onto the individual pins. I have had to deal directly with OTC for a warranty issue with another tool before, and their customer service is great. They shipped me a new tool and told me to discard the old one with no questions asked."
4,Pretty Good,"well This Manga book is not like the other manga books . This kinda like a special editon . Mostly I would recomend it for more avanced Manga Drawers . If you are just a starter I would recommend Geting started. the first book of manga. It really tells you to draw Chibis (really tiny people) . If you are expeting how to draw bodys, and comics or proffional Manga . You don't want get this book . But If you want to learn all about to draw chibis ,(very small or deformed humans) how thier moves , Faces , Eyes ect. But it pretty Good for people who want to draw chibis . Chibis are a different type of Manga . It is not like the drawings in Pokemon , Salior Moon , and Yu-Gi-Oh . Pokemon , Salior Moon , Yu-Gi- Oh are too serious and drama like manga . What this book contains is a manga what is more childesh like and not very serious or dramatic."
5,Great!,"Nice scarf! Color is as seen. The cashmere is thicker than I expected for the price and is good quality. One side is ribbed, the other is like a zigzag ribbing. Length and width are perfect, I fold once and pull the 2 loose ends through the fold and it falls at mid stomach. The washing tag that comes with it is pretty easy to remove, too."
4,Fun game to learn counting and colors,My 19 month old is learning to count and learning colors and loves this game. She gets kinda frustrated because the puppies have a hard time picking up the bones because the magnets inside are very small and weak. You have to have it lined up just right. It would also be better if it went a little higher than 3 barks. Her and my 7 year old love playing this together and the youngest is frequently going to the game cupboard asking for woof woof.
4,Hot Diggity Dog,"A lot of fun for the grandchildren 3 & 5 years of age. They love the barking dog and the small ones they move around. They also like to use the little dogs with their car & train sets, taking them for rides, etc They have become like part of their family. Lots of practice in observations - listening to the number of barks, mobing the dogs, remembering the colours of the bones. The concept of how a magnet works - and so much more."
2,Not to proportion,"I have always loved Carhartt's clothing, still wear some of it regularly. This jacket fails to meet the traditional bill for the company.MY first impression when trying the jacket on was that the arms were not proportionate to the torso - by a large margin. Also, the zipper was very hard to align and I encountered snags every which way, having to switch the alignment of the jacket a few different ways each time I zipped up. To add to the fact, the zipper was made of cheap plastic that would be very hard to replace as it is entwined into the outside elastic.I haven't given up on the company. Tag shows it was still made in the USA. Still, not happy with the quality of this jacket."
5,great jacket,"Amazing works great doubles as awesome work jacket and, to go out with. Can't feel the wind at all!! So good!! Get it."
5,Chargarty active liner,A heavy yet thin durable jacket: worth the money and will last a long time. I never leave the house without it.
5,Awesome,"Was a gift for my fiance, and he loves it. Keeps him warm in the winter and is really durable."
2,jacket,"I bought this jacket thinking it was warm but not is not is very thin ,one of the worst jackets I own also the size looks too big I get normally XL but is like XL tall I got a quilted is 10 times better"
3,Product OK...Rebate missing,"Product is OK ..When I bought this product at that time there was an offer ""Get $20 bonus off from future order when buy Lumiscope products""..and this bonus will be given after two months .. ...It has been 6 months since than and I did not get any coupon so far...reminders didn't work"
5,WWII Marine action figure,"Bought this for my 5 year old Grandson for christmas. He was excited to get it. Was really authentic with small pieces. That was the only concern my Daughter had was small pieces getting lost. He likes military action figures so I knew this would be great, and it was."
4,A Classic...,"For poetry lovers...I love the simplicity of style. If you appreciate the classics, you will enjoy this volume of work."
5,wonderful collection of poems,Paul Negri presents here more than 150 poems ranging from the 17th century till today. You'll find English and American poems. A very recommendable collection for little money!
1,Bad PC Game Controller. . .,"The controller does not retain your custom settings, its way to bulky and the D-pad does not work on alot of games and theres nothing you can do about it. I read alot of the reviews on here and I see everybody seems to compare pc controllers to that of the PS2, then I suggest you go with the (Logitech Rumblepad 2 Vibration Feedback Gamepad) It has all of the features of the PS2 (size, vibration feature, and all the same buttons) and you can use the D-pad on just about every game. Its trully the best pc game controller out in the market now for its features and price."
3,Fans Break,"The ""AirFlo"" technology works by having a fan circulate air through the controller out into tiny holes. The fan blades are very close to the grill on the back of the controller, so if you ever drop the controller while the fan is on, the fan blades will break and the ""AirFlo"" function won't work anymore forever. This is what happened to me early on. However the controller itself continued to work for about 5 years until yesterday when one of the wires got frayed. Other than that, the rubber over one of the analog sticks wore off. It worked for me on XP, Vista 64 bit and Windows 7 64bit over the years. I used it primarily for Need for Speed Hot Pursuit and FIFA 09-11. You do have the option to turn off the fan. I'm giving it a 3 overall because the main attraction of dry hands breaks too easy."
3,Compatibility issues,This controller is not fully compatible with vista 64 bit. Also the buttons are numbered different from the logitech controller that I have so I have to change them in the game if I want to use the controller (ie when I push the jump button on this controller it makes the game attack instead).
2,Lacking Flow,"Having done a two day workshop on the basics of Vegas I felt I need an instruction manual to help me develop and advance my basic understanding of the program. I purchased Vegas 6 Editing Workshop and was very disapointed. Although the book had a lot of information the communication of this information lacked clarity. I then bought Vegas Revealed, The Official Guide by Doug Sahlin. Oh what a difference. It is easy to read and understand and the information just seemed to flow. I have hardly touched the first book since. However I have no doubt as my skills develop I may refer to it for specific information as it does appear to have a little more detail in ther somewhere. If you are wanting a book to teach you Vegas 6 Doug Sahlin's book is the only one to consider"
4,Too bad this is out of print,I just reread this book after a few years. It is REALLY good. It's too bad its out of print.
3,"Very relatable, but Feast of Love was better","The best part of this novel was how accurately it captured early married life and having children. It conveyed a sense that Saul was just being buoyed by the current of his life, and not entirely sure where it was taking him or that he would end up happy. The only thing he seemed sure of was his love for his wife, which never seemed to waver despite his uncertainty about everything else in his life. I just thought it was very poignant, and there are lines from this novel that I still offer up to others because they encapsulate certain feelings so perfectly."
2,old and outdated,"The book that I received in the mail was very old, very tattered and very used. It should have been listed that way and sold for next to nothing. The cover even says price $1.00 that's how old it looks. The cover looks nothing like the image that presented here. I am extremely disappointed and feeling ripped off. There is not much instructional information within the book either. It consists of plates of Lynn Bogue Hunts paintings of a few species of birds and Walter Fosters very brief ""how to"" drawing. I would not recommend this book. It would not be helpful to a beginning artist(like myself) and is below the skill level of someome more advanced."
5,Christmas in Camelot,"A great title in a long list of great, series books! As a third grade teacher, I cannot recommend these books enough! The repetition or similarity of themes, characters, and plot make it very easy for children to utilize comprehension strategies. They can easily predict what will happen, understand the characters, and thoroughly enjoy the stories! YEAH!"
3,stress free,Beautiful Item. Reasonable price. I keep them on my desk at work for stressful times. May order again as gifts.
3,Chinese Healthy Balls,"While these balls are decorative and have a good weight, I was dissapointed in the overall product. The glaze has burs and tiny rough patches that interfere with the soothing qualities the balls are intended to have. Also, the chimes sound rather dull, muffled, and occasionaly clank. I had expected the tones to be clear and have a slight degree of ressonance. The box is somewhat decorative, but of poor workmanship. If you are fortunate enough to live in Honolulu, go down to the Aloha market and pick up a better pair for cheaper from a vendor, if not, try a different brand. I ordered this brand because it was fulfilled by Amazon and could be shipped with the rest of the order. The Chinese Healthy Balls #40555 look nice on the mantlepieace, but lack functionality."
5,"Exactly what I wanted and early, to boot","I ordered the phoenix and dragon balls and they are what I received. Also, got my order two days earlier than the estimated arrival date. Very pleased."
5,Second Turn,"This is one of the best books I've read. MT's insight to the events in Mahabharatha is amazing. He explains very clearly the loose ends and grey areas in the epic. He suceeds in bring out the man in Bhima, who is otherwise viewed as a strong gaint warrior who is portrayed in the epic as a glutton with a dumb charector. In this we see the emotional side of it. The sorrow of the man who sees the Pandavas rejoicing when his eldest son,Kadolkacha is killed.Just because he was a rakshas and Karna used up his secret weapon on him which makes Arjuna safe. This book bring out the true colors of a lot of charectors whom we usually consider as gods. This book is truely revolutionary which makes MT one of my favourite author"
3,wieght set,"ive had these weights for a few months now and they still work with nothing leaking out of the weights like people say they do. the packaging was in good shape and so were the weights and collars. the bar is 5ft and the weights are big and its a little annoying. the six collars that it comes with work great, they never failed me once. one thing i dont like about the bar is that you have to put two pieces of metal together in order to assemble at. i did not think that the bar would be able to support the weight because you have to hammer the rods together. it didnt seem safe to me at first. it worked fine, but after a while of using it my bar started bending and now it is curved so i have to buy a new barbell. the dumbells work great though but the big weights on the small dumbell handles are a little uncomfortable and quite some pressure on your wrist, and the barbell weighs 8 pounds and the dumbells about 1 to 2"
2,totally destroyed box,this set surprisingly came with all the pieces given the state of the box it came in. The box was taped together and ripped open. So my review is based on the poor condition that it was delivered.
2,Not at all like the first book (BEWARE),"If you are looking for a book like the first one detailing the original Survivor, do not buy this one. The book is informative and should of came out during the airing of the Survivor II. It does take you back to Borneo, gives you insight to why they picked Australia (and especially the Queenlands area), and some history of Australia. The next chapters tell about the personality of the survivors and their strategy to win. Where as the last chapter talks about survivor and how to become a contestant."
4,Living thru Horror,Having known Herb during the time of the killings and having gone thru the horror of having friends murdered by someone I knew this book pretty much tells the story as it truly was. I did not know Ed Kemper and am certainly glad I didn't. This was a time in Santa Cruz history that caused the innocence of the time to be lost.
3,"Enjoyable, quirky murder mystery set in the 1st Century","One of a series of books by Australian author Kel Richards, the first being ""The case of the Vanishing Corpse"". All are set in the years after the death of Christ (the vanishing corpse). To quote the cover ""featuring his unique and surprising 1st century world of togas and pizzas, guns and centurions, papyrus and telephones"".Imagine a private eye, somewhat world weary and cynical, although by this book acompanied by his more upbeat wife, working in his newly discovered profession (the profession of private detective was subsequently lost and not rediscovered until Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Shirlock Holmes). Throw in unusual anachronisms and names, an Australian's offbeat sense of humour and a somewhat mixed up view of history.This story follows a search for a missing person through a series of cultic temples. A basic Christian message undelies all.Worth a read, but not his best in this series."
5,Like a memory of sweeter days,Listening to Winchester Catherdral is like taking a lovely walk to memories past. A song with simplistic music and lyrics that are sang so clearly. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys a break from 2003/04 and seeks a simpler time. I give this song a resounding five star rating. I loved it way back when...and I love it now.
1,beware....,"My wife and I listened to this album while we were dating in 1966. We had the album and 8-track tape. She recently asked me to get the CD, because we always like the songs, and especially because her name is Amy, which is the title to one of the songs. What is now being sold is NOT the original album, and as you can see from other posts here, most of the good songs have been replaced. ""Kind of a Hush""???...let Herman sing it. This is truly a disappointment. If you want to hear the music as it should be, you'll have to buy an original album.."
4,Keep Looking,"I have always loved this album and can understand the complaints listed below. I just purchased a used version of this album (on CD) and it has 24 tracks, including Lili Marlene, Nightingale..., Whispering, and Oh Donna Clara (Alas, No ""A Kind of Hush"" but that song seems to fit with Herman's Hermits better, anyway). I haven't listened to the LP in years, but can tell that the tracks are not in the same order. Still lots of fun to listen to.This better version is an Import from 1990: C5 Records C5CD 558.If you like Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band and/or Temperance Seven, but would like the tempo/energy turned down more to Leon Redbone (hope that makes sense), give the New Vaudeville Band a try.Good Luck!"
4,Used this product on my legs,I was advised that I can use this product as an alternative since the woman's shaving cream wasn't available at the moment. Just like the woman's shaving cream this product did not disappoint. It left my legs very smooth and moist.The texture of the product makes it easy to use. I can get a close shave without the cuts. Overall the package allows the product to be applied and stored easily.I am suprised that there isn't more competitors for Kiehl but so far Kiehls shaving cream has worked the best for me.I rated it a 4 instead of 5 since it contains propylene glycol and methylparaben.Made in USA
3,Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars,"I bought this for my 3 month old hoping it would make her car seat more comfortable, because at this point she is not a big fan of car rides. I think the padding around her shoulders and head is pretty good and keeps her feeling more secure and comfortable. I also think that this padding helps a little bit with air flow within her car seat, and therefore she ends up staying at a more comfortable temperature than before. However, I am disappointed that the bottom is not padded. I was hoping it would provide her with another layer of padding all over, but there is no padding whatsoever under the baby's butt. Had I known this, I wouldn't have bought the product. However, that's not to say it wouldn't work for somebody else who is just looking for shoulder and head padding. It is reasonably priced."
1,Poor editing makes this book unreadable,"I agree with the review above. The treatment of the subject matter was anecdotal and superficial. However, I could have lived with that, had the book been more readable on a literary level. Shame on the editor for letting this book be printed in the shape it was. The typos, redundancies and grammatical mistakes were so distracting that I almost didn't finish the book."
5,Good Stuff,"The chair doesn't have too much padding but is still really comfortable. The wheels roll very nicely even on broken up concrete flooring. The lumbar support helps a lot. The assembly was a bit of a balance game since the back attached to the chair through the arm rests, its hard to balance a chair back, line up a screw and use a hex key (which comes with) at the same time with just one person.Just watch out for sharp cornered desks, the arm rest leather will tear if you turn your chair and one of the arm rests hits a desk edge."
2,The doors werent even attached,"I opened this up and 1st thing i notice is the doors to the wooden cabinet werent attached already. It was a little bit of a pain in the butt to get those on. Now that the doors are on the little pegs that hold it on keep falling out. Yes i put them in all the way and yet they still have a tendency to fall out. I dont trust the 2 tiny screws they give you to mount this heavy cabinet to a wall.So ill have to wait to mount till i have proper heavy duty screws and anchors. The final thing i dont like about it is when i screwed or pushed the 2 screws in the doors to attach the knobs the cheap coating on the door started to bubble up. Overall its pretty heavy,unassembled, and cheaply made. I would not recommend anyone buy this. Unless you get it really cheap. I regret trying to save a few bucks and next time i will splurge on a high quality board."
5,classic,"If you were in ten yards of an AM radio in the early 1970s, you know Timmy Thomas' ""Why Can't We Live Together.""Great a song as that was, this album is a classic for three other reasons: Thomas, his organ, and his organ's rhythm box. That is what most of this album is composed of, and it sounds like a sketchbook for modern dance music and trip-hop. Thomas' production here may sound primitive, and is by 2011 standards. But his use of the pulsating, robotic organ drum sound is incredibly modern, inventive, and hypnotic. Only Sly Stone onThere's a Riot Goin Onso inventively.With some updated production and layering here, you'd think you're listening to Tricky or Portishead. Its impossible to put this album in a time machine, but the tracks here are well written, and the infant electronic concepts Thomas uses makes this album essential."
2,nothing special,"moisturizing but not great, kind of sticky, i hate it on my face because it breaks me out, i only use it on my body"
1,There is no discount on price!,"To my dissapointment, the so-called ""sale"" price of $29.99 is no different than the regular price!"
4,Sense of Place,"""Sundays at Sarah's"" is a carefully crafted anthology ranging from a brief but evocative thriller to a verse recognition of the value of time, even to a short-lived fly. All the pieces have a strong sense of place -- often, though not always, the Rhode Island surroundings where the writers live. It's an interesting collection."
1,Do NOT buy these if you plan to ACTUALLY walk!,"They are so uncomfortable considering these are flats. The heel part of the shoe is so unyielding; you'll feel it pinching the instant you start to walk. They look good though, the silver color is nice. I would save my money and move on to another pair of flats because I like to ACTUALLY WALK in my flats."
2,"Looks good, but initially a bit too snug!","I ordered the Unisa Women's Tyron Two Piece Flat,Black,9 M. It's an attractive and elegant shoe, but while most size 9 shoes usually fit quite comfortably, this fit EXACT... so now I'm in the process of wearing it for short bits of time to ""break it in"", b/c I ended up traveling overseas with it, and could not send it back to Amazon.I've received compliments (from guys, no less!) about it, because although it's flat, it does look quite chic. I'd say, if you're looking for a comfy comfy fit, go a half a size bigger."
3,Not satisfied,Its an average text. Concepts r not as clear as I would have expected it to be. Some of problems at the end of the chapters r challenging and I was able to solve them with other reference texts. Since I couldn't find equations to solve those problems.
4,not bad for a protein snack,"Compared to all of the whey powders, protein shots, and protein bars, these are fantastic. They are not exactly a ""perfect pretzel,"" but it is nice to have a crunchy protein snack. I have tried many types. These are pretty decent. The jalapeno is the key though. The butter flavor is not nearly as good!"
2,Not for the squeamish,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't. Yes, it's a sweeping epic of the type I usually enjoy, and it may have a satisfying conclusion, but I found the violence far too traumatic for me. There's one particularly brutal rape scene involving a child, written in extensive and graphic detail -- I am still (nearly a year later) having nightmares about it. You might have a tougher stomach than me or a greater tolerance for a ""realistic"" portrait of slave-owning America. If so, enjoy. Personally, I'd rather stick with Into the Wilderness (Sara Donati) or Outlander (Diana Gabaldon) -- same style and time period, still gripping, still a bit gritty, but books that are fun to read and re-read."
4,Lean and powerful,"This potent little book may not be for someone approaching old age and death timidly or for the young and still immortal. It pulls back the curtain and reveals the nasty fact that, as we may be identified by our professions in our prime, in old age, we are the sum of our physical afflictions, and everyone is in for it.The book takes about two hours to read, and it's Roth story-telling stripped down to the bare essentials. He is feeling his own mortality, and, being a writer, is getting it off his chest with the tools that fit his hand best.Readers who allow themselves to be distracted by the fact that the protagonist cheated on his wives and made some bad marital decisions are either trying to lessen the impact of what Roth is telling them or just miss the point. It's like pretending that the New York Trade Center disaster is not as bad as it could be because some of the fatalities were people who cheated on their wives or on their income taxes."
5,"Rich, Deep","I think when you read Philip Roth you savor every sentence and image, you sip and sip slowly. Everyman is a cascade of detail and reality that pools around your feet and you don't question a moment or a line of dialogue or an image or a feeling. It is what is -- tenaciously real and gripping. Everyman provides an inexorable feeling of dread mixed with sheer wonder about the urges of men, at the inner workings of the pscyhe. The main character is so unique, in a way, and yet (based on the title) so universal. Hard to argue that this isn't up there with The Human Stain, American Pastoral and all the other great Roth works."
3,Apparently What Everyman Does Is Die,"This is a book about death. It's more of a character study than an actual novel, but there are some parts that are brilliantly written and even if much of the content ranges from sad to depressing, there are moments of levity and everything is well-executed."
2,what a depressing story,"I don't understand how none of the hundreds other reviewers never thought to put out a word of warning. This book is about a depressed person. Be warned: it's always depressing being near a depressed person. Its even more depressing when the that depressed guy incessantly offers insights about his depression.This is the story of this book. Its very interesting, one must admit, and there's even a good plot. So good that I couldn't stop reading it. At one point I thought, hey, this poor guy, we rest of people are so lucky. I thought maybe that's the message I should take from the book. But no, its not a message we are left with. There's no message. At the end, it's just a wonderfully written, hopeless book about a lonely, ill and sad person."
2,"Bloodless, unaffecting","This wisp of a novel has little appeal stylistically -- it is coldly and generically written, like a manual -- and delivers mere crumbs to the emotion and intellect. The theme of human death is explored, but almost entirely without reference to human beings. Instead we get ponderous archetypes. I guess this is what passes for sophistication: We are all animals heading into nothingness. Thanks for the insight. Just off the top of my head, I would direct readers to Barney's Version by Mordecai Richler for a novel about dying that has blood running through its veins, or to Grace by Linn Ullman, which covers the subject with a radiance that is never sentimental. Neither of these books, or authors, will ever get the kind of fulsome praise you find for Roth on the rear flap of Everyman. Congratulations on all those awards; shame about the book."
4,book review,this book had alot of information material that I was not aware of.very pleased with it--
1,sworn off of s1!!!,"i loved s1...before this pos! i have slacker jesus, exit through fear, and the sound that ends creation. i also have the demo for exit through fear and s1's cover of sabbaths ""who are you."" this cd is a waste of money; its a ""best of"" compilation with spoken word between the songs! dont waste YOUR money..."
1,Band going through rehab???,"WTF?? Is the band going through drug rehab and pushed into church?? I proudly own ""Exit Through Fear"" and ""Sound That Ends Creation"". Those 2 CD's rock and I really got into this band. But what happened here? There's less than a handful of songs that even resemble the sound of those CD's. There's a bunch of songs that accomplish nothing good, and there's literally a bunch of tracks that are just spoken religious-like passages. Why? This just makes this CD a complete joke. Save your God-spoken messages for Sunday, and give us the music we've come to expect! This band is still considered ""Underground"" and this is only going to dump them into the sewer with the rats and spiders. AVOID THIS CD!"
1,This CD is censored,This is great music but this version of the cd is censored with heaps of dropouts and blank spaces making some parts of the songs not understandable. You're better off going to your local record store and getting the cd with the warning sticker on it.
3,Comfy,"I heard about extraordinary comfort of those.I order a tad too big and the color i chose is a bit blah in person, though, they are very comfortable."
5,Havanianas,Great flip flop. Love the neutral color. Requested for Christmas and my daughter just loves them. Fun footwear. Thank you.
3,Best feeling flip flops but don't last!!,"I have been purchasing Havaiana slims for years and they without a doubt, feel better than any flip flop I have ever had. Unfortunately, they are not built to last. I have found them to last an average of about a year. Strangely, it is always the left flip flop that the center strap pops out on. Happened again today. I am so ticked! I do find myself ordering them over and over when this happens because I love the way they feel so much. So, if you don't mind replacing them every year, these are the best!"
3,they run small,"Im 7 1/2 so I got the 37/38... I should get the 39/40...I got the grey/silver... too silver for me, too bright... different than the picturebeside that they are comfortable and cute"
1,loose fit,Just bought the slim pair and was disappointed that the fit is VERY loose! the straps do not hug the foot at all. My cheap old navy flip flops are a better fit.
1,Hidden Defects-What the mfgr and reviewers didn't tell you,"1. Getting the Guide+ program information system to recognize the channles available from the cable box (Time Warner) was impossible. Thomson (the manufacturer) punted me to TWCC who said it was not their responsibility.2. Even if you could get the Guide+ recognized, it is severely flawed and limited: it can only hold 45 channels! And it can only accept channel numbers up to 125. This means that all Satellite and many Time Wanrer channels cannot be recognized by the box.I have replaced this unit with a Tivo and DVD combo."
2,No support,"Did anyone notice that an $800 item dropped to $300 new inside of one year? This is not TiVo, folks. It is like it, but far from it. The biggest problem is the free program guide. It downloads info at some mysterious hour of the night, and the unit must be turned off to record it. Accidentally leave your unit on and you miss the program guide. Recording without the guide is as clunky as your first VCR. Plus, the guide only goes out about 72 hours. Ask it to record a weekly series and it freaks out when it cannot find the next scheduled program in the guide. It is a dvd player, but those run about 50 bucks these days. Save your money, buy a decent TiVo box and the lifetime license. I can't even get rid of this used unit on EBay."
1,As the world turns ...,"As the world turns, so does Nadine Gordimer. If she had written novels like this one throughout her career she would not have been awarded the Nobel Prize. There is an apartheid, and a post-apartheid Nadine Gordimer. The former was the combative writer who, with her brilliant prose, greatly contributed to showcasing the horror of life under the old regime; the latter is still up for definition. One thing is for sure: she ended her activism when her party took power. The old problems, compounded by the new -corruption on the rise, crime, the health crisis, and the government's indifference or unwillingness to face them- apparently do not merit scrutiny or criticism from Mrs. Gordimer. And ... has she forgotten how to write sentences? Her boring characters and their boring lives make for cumbersome reading.I'm sure Nadine Gordimer set out to write a good novel, in her usual vein; what she has published is a mediocrity."
1,"Boring, boring,boring",This stories do not keep little audience motivated. My kids did not last 5 minutes listening the CD. (And they loooove to listen audio books...) Jamie Lee Curtis is not good as storyteller she is rather boring. Her voice expresses no emotion in any part of the CD. I would NOT recomend anyone to waste money in this CD. It is awful!!
1,good but very outdated...,"This book might be a very good book 10-15 years a go, but now most of the stuff is outdated. Don't waste your money on this book, instead buy another book. I especially recommend books from Richard Stevens. They are really well written and answer the needs of programmers and/or users of the present."
2,it's okay,"this movie reminds me of my chess skills. it started out strong, but fell apart at the end. overall, it is a likeable indie film. it is low budget. i thought the writing and editing was good. the points i don't like and hence 2 stars: 1) the cover has nothing to do with the movie. there is no nudity, though the witch is mighty fine looking. in the rating section it does say sexually explicit scenes but there are none. 2) it's full screen, not wide screen. 3) there is no depth to any of the acting. 4) the ending was bad. 5) the visual effects weren't that good. but, saying all that, i still like it somewhat and give it credit for the effort."
4,Jacket Liner,Fit and quality appear good. Have not put it to the test in the field yet but the initial wearing inconjunction with the wader jacket are comfortable and do not restrict movement. Think I'm going to like it in the duck blind with waders.
5,One of the FUNNIEST comics around,"My only experience with John Pinette was a brief routine on cable several years ago and then purchasing a CD. John Pinette is one of the very funniest comics around, if not the funniest. Hands down!"
5,Laugh till you wet your pants,"John Pinette has to be one of the funniest ""clean"" comics around. He pokes fun of himself in the most hilarious way. He is witty, sharp, quick and dead pan serious which makes his observations even funnier. He is just a dear person who sees humor in his life at every turn. Love him. If you have a weak bladder, wear extra padding, you will need it."
1,"John Pinette / ""I'm Starvin"" - Disappointing!","If you bought John Pinette's ""I Say Nay,Nay, you viewed most of the sameshow. If a show has a different name, ""I'm Starvin"", it should have different material!I was very dissapointed!"
2,Humorous yet boring,"One of those comedians who is humorous, but not funny. If you grew up Amish and have never seen standup before, this is the funniest thing ever, but otherwise it's really not."
2,DRASTIC Change in Appearance,"John Pinette's appearance has changed so drastically in the last 10 years I would never have guessed it was him-- I hadn't seen him since the Seinfeld finale. He looks more like a young Orson Wells. God bless him for losing weight, but I liked the heavier verson. I can't believe all the 5 star reviews. I guess that's proof of the dumbing down of America. I laughed maybe twice during the show; very low brow humor. Over an hour's worth of food related jokes gets old after about ten minutes. I bought this DVD because I remember John back when he was funny. He needs to come up with some new and VARIED material. Remember his old ""Tattoo as Batman"" routine, that was classic."
5,"Buffets, water parks, and hilarity","John Pinette shows that comedy can be done without vulgarity, as he continues his riffs on buffets, water parks, and the realities of living as a large man. His good-heartedness shows as well. Great fun!"
5,Funny without the 4 Letter Words,"I Laughed so hard; I cried. It is great to come across a Standup Comic that does not need the ""Blue"" routine to get the laughs. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Hilarious,I bought this for my husband for christmas and he Loved it. We laughed so hard. He has borrowed this out to everyone he knows.
5,Classic!,I cant wait to watch it again by far one of the funniest comedians without even trying to hard to make me laugh I've seen.
5,"A Great Show, Funny!","Awesome funny tear jerking show, a must see. John Pinette rants and raves non-stop about food, family and friends. His show is well worth the time to sit back and enjoy entertainment in its purest form."
2,"Good, but Confusing","I do believe the story line was a good one, but it became confusing and so I had a hard time following parts of the play/movie. Like his escape, or his return to jail or the 3 ladies, who were actually ghosts! I do recommend this play because I so enjoy the guy who played the older boyfriend. He has defined the character of a smooth criminal. Thanks!"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"The high-praise for this slim book astounds me. It is repetitious to the point of distraction. There are better books elsewhere, that can provide you with better instruction -- Milton Berle's Private Joke File, Volume One, for example."
2,OK,This book was worth $[...]5 to me. I am a moderaely successful comic/writer but found it shallow and redudant...very redundant...did I mention redundant???? If you are a starting out rookie than this is a must..if you are 13 years old or older then pass on it..or at least buy it used...I'll sell mine for $[...] bucks...this guy has no real stand up time on stage..professionaly...if you've been there you know...and I've been there...and know....GV
5,Nicely made,This product is well thought out....while installing I over tightened the clamp strap and broke it....the company promptly sent a replacement at no charge....am well pleased with this product
2,Disappointing,"While it endedup working how i wanted untill i declined to use it, the design of the inner cup is stupid because the fact that it was not all self contained is the reason i lost the cup."
3,"a good router, but too expensive","For starters, you shouldn't even be looking at this old B/G WiFi. It was a decent choice a few years ago, but there are better options now. Maybe if you find a really cheap refurb unit.WiFi N mode (and also A mode if possible) is the future. I love my Macs and my iPod, but AirPort is not cost-competitive. Apple's N router is $179, whereasBelkin F5D8233-4 N Wireless Routeris half that price with nearly the same features (slightly slower wired ports)."
3,Decent,It was very informative but not quite a short introduction. Perhaps too informative and a little too much to read for first timers.
5,Good introduction to speech processing,"I am new to speech processing and this book was my starter for this subject. It is a very good beginning, but still very indepth leaving information for later studies. It is structured very logical and the extensive literature and web references are very helpful"
5,Looking for this cart!!!!,"We have several of these carts and they work great----I need to buy more, where (in the US) can we find them????"
2,Disappointed,"I had heard a lot about this band from people who loved them, so I bought the CD kinda on a whim. I was disappointed with most of it. After the first 4 tracks (which are good, but not fantastic), the CD takes a serious downhill turn. Most of it sounds like filler material. In addition, the production is one of the poorest I've ever heard on a label release. I know Switchfoot has some hardcore fans, but this one is simply not for me."
5,Great Sophmore Album,"This is a very good album showing the band's maturity and growth as musicians. Songs like New Way to Be Human, Company Car and Something More are well crafted, catchy and just really good songs. This whole album is a good listen showing how a three piece band can work well together. Recomended to anyone who like solid pop rock with a twist and a wave or two."
5,Teach yourself about Montana with this handy guide,"In this guide, you will learn why underground coal fires have played a prominent role in shaping the surface topography and nature of the overlying strata in parts of eastern Montana. You will learn why widespread dryland farming in the early 20th century often caused devistating salinization of the soil. Filled with numerous photos and illustrations, the past and present of Montana's geology is at your fingertips. From the sedimentation, coal formation and general uplift of eastern and central Montana,to the dominant influence of tectonic and igneous events in the western region, to the recent effects of glaciation in the northern regions, Alt and Hyndman provide you with a detailed description and explanation."
2,Rather worthless on the road since it has no milepost info,"I am a professional geographer who has purchased and used numerous roadside guides in my field explorations. This book is a good overview of Montana's geologic story, but the maps are lacking detail and it lacks a milepost listing of features. It is suitable for reading in preparation for a trip, but without milepost listings, it is not a good field tool. In addition to this book, I also have purchased the South Dakota book in this series and it too was a disappointment."
2,Did they forget to put the fun in?,"This game seems like a near-clone of Alpha Centauri, but set in a galaxy instead of on a planet. The basic structure of the game is virtually identical, but the major difference is the lack of fun. There is no sense of humor and no cool videos. And the competing races are not at all memorable. Without these elements of entertainment I very quickly felt like I was just reverse engineering a computer program.Also there are holes in the playability of the game. Several times I got stuck in a state where I had no resources to do anything and I just sat there turn after turn with nothing happening, waiting to be overwhelmed by other teams. It was not at all clear what I had done wrong.Good concept and technically sophisticated. Just not fun."
2,Cheap Rip-off,"Being a Moo fan and seeing this game, I had hopes. boy was I wrong. on the ooutside it loks like an increadible Moo ripoff, which I would not have minded. ounce you start playing however, you come to realize that there is no real hope for this game.No ship customization, no organized way of of doing combat other than ""go here and kill"", and for Willy's sake, you can't even play as anyone other than the stupid F***ing humans! Diplomacy you have to discover through tech reserch, even then it's so mundane it hurts. unimaginative planet design, and tedious turns.Don't get me wronge, there are a handfull of things that are decent. I dig the major and minor races, and how the minor ones just pop up out of nowhere. If you start doing evil your entire screen changes to dictate how ruthless you are. and the random anomalies that you can explore are a nice touch.All in all, it's an unimpressive game that it more bark than bite."
5,Amazing Game,"This game is absolutely amazing. It feels like a cross between Master of Orion and Civ. I became addicted the first day I bought it.They got rid of the tactical combat and ship design which plagues most 4X strategy games today. Nothing like tactical combat to turn 10 hours of fun play into 50 hours of boring, tedious battles. I'm glad somebody finally made a game like this.Also, the game offers many paths to victory. I've won games where I haven't been involved in a single battle by concentrating on diplomacy and culture. Other games I've terrorized the galaxy with my elite armadas.There really is just too much to say about the game. Try it!"
4,good all around book about commercial fishing,"This book is a collection of storys of commercial fishing from fishing in the bering sea or around alaska sea urchin fishing in the atlantic also fishing in louisana.Some are well known authors for those familar with commercial fishing and books that i would definitely recommend if you like this book.Such as linda greenlaws book ""The hungry ocean"" spike walkers book ""working on the edge working in alaskas most dangerous profession"" an excellent book .This book cover some womens roles in fishing as in fishing for crabs in the bering sea some tough women. I would also recommend any book by william mccloskey whether it be fiction or non fiction"
3,A little too self-serving-characters interesting,"I just finished watching this and the ""making of"". As it had created quite a buzz and was deemed quite controversial I was excited to see this indie. It had its funny moments, but the sex scenes seemed planted in parts, just to be controversial. I didn't mind seeing them, but I am not sure all scenes even served a purpose, aside from shock value. I actually liked the ""behind the scenes process"" discussion much better,and I found it exciting that the actors were not quite aware EXACTLY how the film would develop until after they were completely involved in the work shops. My favorite seen is when the LI character smashes her vibrating egg and when the depressed boyfriend is finally able to accept himself for who he is. Some of the dialog was very poignant and shed light on some universal sexual anxieties and insecurities and unapolegtically explored them. Overall, I am glad I viewed it, but it was not ground shattering for me."
3,"LOTS, AND LOTS AND LOTS OF SEX, SEX, SEX......","Well, a perfectly executed self-performed fellatio sort of begins when you see the movie.(ha). Couples sex therapist Sophia (Yin-Lee) is treating gay couple James and Jamie as they struggle with monogamy. She tells them that she has never had an orgasm, so they introduce her to a club called ""Shortbus"" and dominatrix, ""Severin."" One thing about this movie, it actually does have some depth to it. There is always a penis, a breast or someone or some people have explicit sex some place on the screen and one, two or more exploring each other's sexuality and minds.Just another day in New York I guess."
4,45$ you better jump and get it right now !,"ive been using this card for over a year and i played bf2,halo,act of war and many many great games but you wont get more than med range graphic any way for this price its worth it well untill dx10 comes :)"
1,Nothing like the cover.. just plain horrible :(,"This aerobics DVD was definitely converted from VHS format. The image is all pixelated, barely in color, and takes place in some freaky room with black tape all over it.The main girl doesn't look anything like the one on the cover. In fact, it's a completely different person. There are 5 people in the video, all wearing dr. martins (no sneakers or gym wear) and the music is from 1988.If you for some reason do buy this DVD, there is 1 good part.. the end where the teacher goes CRAZY and starts tap dancing like crazy to this 80's music and everyone circles around her clapping. VERY WEIRD INDEED."
2,Im reading the same story over and over...,"I liked his writing style, and his stories are very exciting. But i feel like im reading the same fishing story over and over again. which creates a lack of interest half way through the book."
4,Fish Story,"Fontava is a Cuban immigrant who scuba dives and spear fishes around the oil rigs that dot the continental shelf around New Orleans. The oil platforms have become artificial reefs that attract sea creatures and consequently, divers. The sport is dangerous, but not insanely so; its enthusiasts have swum and hunted for decades, experiencing plenty of scratches and bites but relatively few fatalities. The author apparently decided to write in the style of the WWF, which I found off-putting. But beneath the macho posturing is his sincere lifelong love affair with skin diving and the friends who share the adventures, thrills, dangers, stories, and parties. Like most hunters, they are conservationists at heart; like many men, they look back at their wild youths and marvel at their survival. Fontava has a nice sense for describing the primal thrill that comes from testing oneself against the forces of nature."
2,A Disconnected Jumble of Macho Bar-room Stories,"This book reminds me of the kind of stories you hear in a bar. At first, it can be entertaining to hear colorful characters in a bar tell drunken stories, and if the stories seem less than credible, well, that's all part of the fun.But after a while, the stories all start to sound the same. You get tired of the teller's propensity to end every paragraph with ""there's just no getting around it."" If the guy trots out a tired movie analogy one more time (""it's like that time in Dirty Harry when Clint Eastwood points the gun at that guy..."") you're going to run screaming from the room.Not every book has to be a literary masterpiece. But something resembling proper use of punctuation and grammar helps. It would have been possible to write a book on this topic, rather than a disconnected jumble of stories with no coherent narrative. There are some fun stories in here, but the book is too painful to read to justify wading through them."
1,Very Disappointing,"Very disappointing dvd. Brilliant has published some great music performance dvds, but this is not one of them. ""Actors"" simulate Dvorak and peers some supposedly simulating performing a Dvorak string quartet while in an overgrown field and forrest. This dvd also contains two separate cds of Dvorak compositions - neither of which I was interested in hearing. If you want a great 1 hour video about Dvorak which traces his entire life using numerous photographs, I highly recommend the dvd ""Deo Gratias"" also available from Amazon."
1,Instead of London - Burn this CD!,"This album is so bad, words can't descirbe how terrible it is. If you want a true tribute in the spirit of The Clash, buy the Backlash CD instead."
1,How could this happen?,"Let me start by saying I bought this CD for one reason; Rancid's cover of Cheat. That is the only redeeming value of this piece of commercialized fodder produced by the machine. Overall, Novacaine for the brain. My only question is, who's responsible? Who in the world selected Third Eye Blind,Ice Cube and Mack 10? In the words of Jello Biafra, Drool, Drool, Drool, Drool..."
2,CLAMPDOWN IS THE ONLY REASON TO BUY IT!,"i bought the cd specifically for the indigo girls' clampdown. that song is great. the rest of the cd is lacking (to put it nicely). unless you are a huge fan of one of the featured artists, don't bother!"
1,Terrible!,"I thought when you make a tribute you try your best to make it sound as close to the original songs as possible, this album was disgusting especially the ice cube/mack 10 they butchered the song! my suggestion go buy the original artist and then you wont be dissapointed! a one star rating is still too good for this cd."
3,"Ignore Extremist Reviews, Not a Bad Disc","I am a huge Clash fan like many others who wrote in. But I think most reviews are overreactions. What the hell did these people expect from this disc? A couple tracks are good, a couple are very good, a couple suck. End of story. It's not the Clash, just what some others have made of some of their tunes. If you're a Clash fan, you'll be interested just for the curiosity factor. I doubt you'll listen to the disc a lot. I don't. It's a novelty to be broken out on occasion on road trips. Now go back to listening to Give 'Em Enough Rope.Sayonara!"
1,Ultimate Human Body Learning Power Pack,I am disappointed because I can not use it. It can not be loaded on Windows XP.
4,Eric in the early years,"Classic Clapton, I had this album 20 years ago, still sounds great. Purchased this after watching the new Crossroad 2010. Gotta love Eric, he is the best."
2,not very good,"It seems to me that not only the sound man was high on something, but also the whole band.The sound quality was awful, but also the musicianship was lacking......speeding up and slowing down all over the place.I believe that these musicians and singers could do a lot better."
1,This is the WORST TEXTBOOK ever published!,"This is more of a philosophy book than a mathematics textbook! It is completely unconventional, and does not explain or even present many of the most important concepts that are VITAL in this subject! Completely unacceptable!"
4,PURE PLEASSURE,"JUST A FEW WORDS TO LET YOU ALL KNOW THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE EVERYONE WHO LISTENS THIS CD WILL BE CAPTIVATED BY THE DELICIOUS PERFORMANCE OF THESE VERY GREAT AND YOUNG ARTISTS. BARTOLI AND TERFEL ARE AN UNEXPECTED DUO AND MAYBE DUE TO THIS FACT, THE RESULTS ARE SO SURPRISING. THE TRACKS SELLECTION IS QUITE GOOD (SPECIALLY MOZART'S) AND THE ONLY DETAIL TO COMMENT AS PER MY POINT OF VIEW IS THAT IS WAS NOT NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THE RECITATIVES, BUT AS I SAID, THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW. LLUIS SOLER/BARCELONA"
2,Mabuse Madness,"The legendary criminal genius (played once again by Wolfgang Preiss) receives short shrift in this 1962 follow-up to ""The Return of Dr. Mabuse."" Poor scripting derails Harald Reinl's atmospheric direction while Gert Fröbe's Inspector Lohmann is sorely missed. Affectionate references to ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and Fritz Lang's ""Spies"" remain among the few bright spots in a disappointing crime thriller. Composer Peter Sandloff provides another eccentric jazz-rock score."
3,Not too bad.,"I was expecting it to be better based on the clips they played on 7th Heaven... but there was about 6 songs on here I liked a lot. esp. ""Walkin'"" and ""Nothin' 'Bout Nothin'"". Her voice seems a little flatter in places than you would expect, but I still like it."
4,The quickest settings!,I was surprised with the settings. It was very easy. It took only 5 minutes for all settings. I love this beautiful gagget.
2,Only moderate battery life,"The charge only lasts for about an hour. Outside of that, my computer recognizes the battery and there are no other issues. I'm going to see if I can get an exchange for one that will hold the charge for longer....though in the future I will just buy directly from Toshiba."
3,replacement battery for toshiba sattelite A205,"It's specificic spare part. Information from dealer was accurate (Toshiba Battery PA3399U-2BRS 6 Cel Li-Ion, 4000 mAh, 10,8V). Perhaps 3 different photos attached give 100% information in order to be sure. Price was lower as retail form toshiba, but its possible get 10% off from other dealer. Delivery time was exact as offer."
1,Bad Quality !!!,"By reading various review , I decided that I will go with Toshiba battary instead of cheap replacement battary .So I purchased it from Amazon last Oct .It was working okay (although the total battary hours were just 1 hr ) .since I always connected to Power outlet , I was little comfertable with it .But last week , suddenly battary started getting charged . Eventhough , I kept it connected to power for 24hrs without doing any activity , my laptop was always showong that it got charged 0%.When I contacted toshiba customer care support , it was pathetic .Everybody was transferring my call to the other person . I had to talk to 7 different people before I could get the actual person .Anyway I had submitted my claim and I am hopeful that they will approve it ."
4,Good Substitute,"Holds the charge very well and will recommend it to my friends, fits without a hitch and packaged well in box"
5,A great album and a great guy. Really nice country.,"I enjoyed all of the 13 songs on the CD. My favorites were the ballads, #3 Move On Your Dreams about the young couple that moved up the ladder of life only to end up in tragedy; and Rainbow has real meaning for me---sometimes you don't know what you have until you run away and look back. I also like the upbeat songs like #5 ""Family Man"" and #9 ""Bumper"". Mark has a voice that is unique but in some ways sounds like the lead singer of Alabama, Randy Travis, and also a little like Waylon Jennings. I love the album and recommend it to anyone who enjoys good music."
5,A nice addon for MSTS,"Sandpatch:An older addon in the train-sim world but still worth it to this day. Mountain railroading will challenge you as you climb up to the line's namesake, Sandpatch, PA. With upgrades for the route and to the sim itself, it's worth consideration. Remember, if you like Chessie System or CSX this route is for you!"
3,sandpatch,"This addon is good, but lacks in some areas. The same cabview is used for every locomotive and the cabview looks as if it has only been partially completed. The signalling is of the B&O Color Posistion Light type and has been done pretty accurately for the time period although it doesnt display the modern indications."
1,poor,LUCKY TO GET IT TO SCAN NORMAL COPY PAPER LET ALONE SMALLER PIECES OF PAPER. WOULD NOT LET ME RETURN PRODUCT.
2,Not compatible with Win7,"This model is so out of date, I am surprised that Amazon is still selling it. The manufacturer only had a ""beta"" driver for Windows Vista and no driver (or any plan to make one as far as I can tell) for Windows 7. If you upgrade your computer, you are SOL so look elsewhere for a scanner!"
1,Donny Hathaway,SORRY! I expected more from Donny Hathaway. Two good songs and the rest I didn't like. Save your money and get the Greatest hits.
5,Great insights.,"Anyone in marketing, design or just business should read this book. It's an easy read, straight to the point."
4,"Good read, makes you think","Brand Gap was a quick airplane read. It's layout and common sense language made it an easy read. The book had very good points about brands versus logos and some real world mistakes that companies make. I read the book four weeks ago and I'm still thinking about it! Somewhat shotty construction, though - my book binding fell apart."
3,"Does the job, but dangerous to use","I use this saw to undercut the door frames when installing laminate floor. The sharpness and thinness of the blade makes it an ideal tool--but with a ""catch"". The screw that keeps the blade with the handle gets loosen almost every time, no matter how much I tighten it. The blade can dangerously fly off as a result, and I hurt myself from a cut the first time this happened. People be aware!"
3,Airport Extreme Card,The card works for the power mac G5 and receives WiFi signal - however the range is terrible (my MacBook has full signal at the exact same range.) I have since had to purchase an antenna to get extra range. Don't try to go over 25 feet without an antenna.
1,"Deceptively slow, way slower than new Airport Extremes, or Express","Is this a joke? Description says the Airport extreme card has a "" new wireless technology called 802.11g"". Big time ripoff, questionable seller for failing yo add that this ""new technology"" is already quite ancient. Wireless G was surpassed by a newer version of the Airport extreme using a technology called ""wireless 802.11N."" If this wireless G card is paired with a wireless N router, you will only get slow wireless G speeds. Great deal though if your goal is to slow your network down. Wireless G is and older and slower technology, buy an N card or adapter."
5,airport extreme card,"I got this airport card for my second computer (an emac) upstairs. It works great. I had no problem installing it, and my internet connection seems to be almost as fast as my main computer downstairs that's hooked up to a router."
1,wifi for mac mini,This card did not do the job of making my mac mini wifi enabled. there is another piece that was not disclosed?
4,Almost Perfect...but not quite,"The CD arrived in PERFECT, FACTORY SEALED condition and I'm a STICKLER for True Stereo. CD#1,Track #1 ""Little Bit O'Soul"" by Music Explosion's and Track #6 ""This Magic Moment"" done by Jay & Americans - BOTH were originally recorded in Stereo. However, the stereo as presented leave a lot to be desired. Ian Whitcomb's ""You Turn Me On"" is ""Ugly Mono"" all the way.CD#2, Track #1 ""Nobody But Me"" by the Human Beinz and Track #10 ""Snoopy vs the Red Baron"" by the Royal Guardsmen - BOTH were originally recorded in Stereo..and neither of which are in Stereo as presented here. It is disappointing to have good songs, originally recorded in Stereo...NOT offered here on this CD. All other songs on BOTH CDs are in Very Good Stereo. Thus, earning only 4 Stars instead of the possible 5. Better Luck next time. All songs are the Original versions performed by the Original Artists."
2,John,While this product will serve its purpose the battery case area is cheaply made. I would expect problems with this as battery in the future. I will probably have to use a piece of tape to keep the battery cover from popping open.
3,Looks good,The item looks good and hopefully it works just as well. Hope fully it does the trick in the event of Monoxide leaks
4,Hopefully we never have to hear it's alarm,This unit was very easy to install. All we did was plug it in. There is no way for me to give this a full 5 star rating since the alarm has not been needed yet. Hopefully it stay that way.
4,Great Product // Battery Backup Feature A+,Great product especially for the price.Battery backup is a must. Not sure why other reviewers noted flimsy parts/battery area as I have been unable to locate anything wrong with the unit i received.
4,First Alert CO Monitor,So far it works good in 3 months - every few days we test it and works good. Only thing could be improved is to have the green light that shows that the monitor is on is so deep inside that we can hardly so from a distance and the reading of amount of CO in the room even while testing is so deem that we can hardly read the number. Dial numbers need more light on them and this could be because the green light is too far in. I may talk to the Company for this in few days.
2,Defective,"It looks nice and maybe it works but i bought 2 of them and after installing the batteries the compartment door would not close and kept popping open. others may just tape it shut however if I purchase a brand new item, i should not have to jerry-rig it for it to work properly, I returned them."
4,"So far, so good",Very easy to put in place. I may never know had good it is unless any occasion arises for its use.
2,How am I supposed to turn it on?,It's on my wall......doing nothing. Really. I have no idea how to turn it on or how it works. The manual does not help at all. Rather it makes me even more confused. It's practically useless now. Can someone please tell me just how do i turn it on?
5,Has all the features I expected.,This has everything as advertised. Could be improved if offered as a onelink product. Easily moved from room to room.
5,Shark Saws are hard to beat!,"I have added this saw to my growing array of Shark Saw products. I bought the CutsAll Saw (2 of them in fact) primarily to keep one in the workshop/home and one for the car. These things will cut many materials quickly and easily, including wood, plastics and composit materials. Pretty much a one saw fits all type of blade. Great to have in home, workshop, car, caravan or even the boat."
2,wide age bracket appropriate,The magic school bus series seems to be written for a 4-5 year old while containing material appropriate for a ten year old. The books seem very complete and well written but there is a very wide age range that they seem to be written for. Seem to be very good for a VERY advanced child but not for the normal 4 or 5 year old.
5,Underrated band of the '80s,"Being from Harriburg, PA, I heard a lot of KIX in the early 1980s. KIX was from Maryland, but played the southcentral PA region quite a bit and local radio was very supportive. I had KIX's first album on vinyl and cassette. I wore both out. I bought another cassette and took it to college with me in 1983. I fraternity brother got ahold of it and wouldn't give it back after we graduated! I am now purchasing the KIX CD and never giving it up. I may not listen to it 10 hours a day like I did when I was 17, but it's a nostalgic album for me and I must have it in my collection. If you are a fan of good, hard-driving, rock/pop, you will enjoy this album. I've got to think that if KIX had put out this album in 1984-85, MTV would have had several videos in constant rotation. This band was as good as the other '80s rock bands, if not better. Althought he band broke up several years ago, I still hold out some hope for a reunion! KIX are for kids......even the 36 year old variety!"
5,Kix - Best Band Out of Maryland,"This one really got the band started. Features some great lyrics. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah is a great studio track, but it is even better live. It is a shame this band broke up."
2,worked great..then not,"had this working fine with a microsoft wireless mouse/keyboard and switching between an XP box and a Linux box. then 1 day it just quit. i crawled behind and unplugged and replugged and powered off and on both machines and nothing. there's nothing to troubleshoot either. no software, no manual switch nothing. reading the manual is useless - it's either gonna work - or not. i'll get a switch with a manual switch next time and probably not one by belkin."
1,didn't work with my boxes,"I could switch from one of my boxes, but not from the other-- meaning once I switched to the second box, I was hosed! I don't know if it was defective, or if it wouldn't work with that mobo (VIA KT266), or what, but I returned it ASAP."
4,"Beautiful, Engaging, but not Explosive","Mehldau and Metheney have collaborated such that their work on this cd is continuous with their previous but separate efforts while still being a creative and enjoyable work. Most of the tracks have, as their foundation, Mehldau's incredible sense of balance between the complex and the simple. Mehldau's sense of when and how to fill--and not fill--in the spaces continues to be an incredible strength of his approach. Metheney's contribution is to ride this gentle wave with his usual mix of engaging accessibility. Metheny's use of a synthesizer effect allows him to explore two of the tunes more freely which provides the most satisfying tracks on the album (5 & 9). What the album lacks in explosiveness (check out Mehldau's version of ""Solar"" on the album Art of the Trio Vol IV) it makes up in subtle inventiveness."
1,Guide to a non existant book,"Thank you so much for writing a guide to a book that doesnt and wont ever exist. Thats what you get for writing something based on speculation. Maybe you should write a guide to the next Harry Potter, or maybe even One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest II: Still Cuckoo After All These Years..."
2,Powerful,"This trap is is strongly built with a very powerful spring. Setting it can be intimidating because it requires strength and care because one could easily break one's finger or even a wrist. I've tried setting it and found it too difficult. Because of the strong spring, releasing a caught rodent for disposal after being trapped, would be a huge, messy challenge in reverse. However, inertia on my part has prevented me from requesting a refund even though its unlikely that I will put it to use. My rating is not for use of the product, but for safety concerns. I would like to hear from users who have successfully used this trap on a continuing basis: set trap-catch- release and dispose-and reset."
4,Drag Racing Motor Sports,"Good story line for introducing a youngster to the sport of Drag Racing, Planning to give as a gift to a young mother ."
2,Bored to tears,I finally gave up two weeks into trying to read this one. It just never caught my attention. I wanted to keep going since the reviews were good and I've found Kalla's other books very readable. This one just felt overly dragged out and uninteresting.
2,"Entertaining, but weak story","Pandemic by Daniel Kalla is an entertaining and highly relevant apocalyptic adventure story (in these times with h1n1, SARS, swine-, bird- and Mexican flu) yet as a high ranked epidemic-focused science fiction thriller, the style and rythm of the story seem to be out of synch. On occasion the storyline bogs down into too much technical detail about virology and epidemology, which interrupts the pace of the narration. Not that some stretches of the book are too slow; the book is in general fast moving. Parts are are not very realistic (especially if you know more about the topic) and on occasion it is hard to connect with the main protagonists."
4,A Thrill in a Day,"I started reading Pandemic with no idea what to expect from an unknown author, and I was pleasantly surprised. The topic is incredibly timely, and the book was informative as well as exciting to read. I found the novel to be well-paced, a page-turner at times, while slowing down occasionally, just enough to let me catch my breath. It was mostly an easy read, but technical enough to make me feel that I was getting a scoop on developing events in medicine. It drew me in so tightly, that near the end, I refused to put it down. I highly recommend it."
3,Not the best story line,I felt like the last part of this book was done by a different author or that it was added at the last minute. At the end it picked up. I had a hard time finishing the book--not the best.
2,There has to be a better way to spend a few hours...,"I picked up this book on the strength of the title and the handful of reviews at Amazon. I had previously read, and enjoyed, the Hot Zone and a couple of other books from this genre. I therefore had fairly high expectations. Sadly, this book was a serious disappointment. While the science provided by the physician author is laid out well, the plot is so trite, the characters so two-dimensional and stereotypical, and the dialog so wooden that I seriously contemplated abandoning the book mid-way through. I had always assumed that writing a pot-boiler a-la Grisham, Crichton et al, must be something that it would be hard to do badly. This author has certainly dispelled that notion."
1,WRONG CARD DO NOT PURCHASE WITHOUT READING THIS,"This product listing is wrong, the pictures show the true card, a Diamond Stealth S90 fx5200 128MB. It is NOT the eVGA fx5200 256MB card."
3,Bought this for iBook G3,Bought this because My ibook didnt have an Airport card. It fit perfect and was working good but for some reason it stopped. Wont recommend
5,Five Stars,Apple Airport Card - Network adapter - AirPort - 802.11bThe quality of the card was excellent and the response to my order was done quickly and effeciently. Couldn't ask for better. Very happy with everything.
4,"Fast, reliable, cheap. Easy to install.","Fast, reliable (replaced original card after 10 years). Easy to install (follow instructions in Youtube videos - search ""Airport card install iBook"")."
1,Obsolete firmware!!,"The unit was OK and the vendor support was quite good, however the item sold by the Amazon vendor was so old, that it could not be brought up to date. Intermediate versions needed to do this were not available from the vendor, Netopia, now Motorola anymore!! Do not buy from this Amazon vendor."
2,Over-engineered and overpriced,"My phone has a built in headset plug, but in order to get a plantronics headset to work you MUST plug it into their amplifier box. They've made deliberate design decisions to ensure that you can't just plug it into your phone.That doesn't really make any sense. A headset is just a normal telephone receiver shaped like a headset, so I should have the same sort of plug shape and not require a clunky, oversized, battery-requiring ""universal modular amplifier"" to make it work."
3,Cheap Junk,"This thing is a piece of junk. Yes, it increased the volume for my headset, but the sound quality is very poor. I also bought the AC adapter, but plugging that in makes the amp unusable with feedback. I'm returning the AC adapter and keeping the amp until I can afford to buy a decent one."
5,Now it ships with the A10 cable!,Ignore earlier reviews that complain of the missing A10 cable. I've been using these for years. As with other users I was frustrated when my first headset arrived and I realized that I needed to purchase the A10 cable separately. Plantronics finally figured out that the cable should be shipped with the amplifier. This is a great improvement!
1,Sucks battery acid out of batteries,These units are replaced on an almost daily basis where I work. Every type of battery that we have tried leaks inside the unit after a while rendering it USELESS. Not to mention the batteries are a real challenge to remove. So much so that plantronics equiped these units with their very own plastic tool which is attached to the bottom. This would be the epitomy of negligent and sloppy engineering. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
3,Better in regular book form,The photos include are an important part of his teaching. Unfortunately the Kindle does a very poor job with photos. This book would be much more effective in traditional printed form.
4,"Quality reading, but a little dated","I read this book in 2003, 17 years after its publication, and while much of the reading is enjoyable and dotted with fascinating anecdotes and observations, I had to laugh at some of the frequent mentions of the Soviets and their communist plots. Naturally, at the time it was written, that was a valid threat, but now it is almost amusing to read such speculations about that particular superpower.This is a well written book that provides solid information that the end of time IS near. I would recommend this to both Christians and non-Christians alike."
5,Fits as it was intended to,"First off, if you are looking for a loose fitting rashguard this is not it. I got this because I bodyboard and bodysurf a lot and I'm sick of getting sun burned on my back as well as I want to avoid getting rashes from my bodyboard. I needed a rashguard that will stay in place and wont ride up and this thing fits great. I got the silver one and I'm definitely going to get the white one, Wish the black and red was still in stock. Overall great Item and I highly recommend it."
5,Troy Is Burning.,"Josh Ortega is no Cassandra --people are believing him. The future he warns us of is even now setting our walls on fire. Down there on the beach waits the wooden horse. His best characters are despicable -- the rich pretending to be in it for our good and the good of the planet. That next book is going to be more evil than our fate, if we don't pay attention. I want."
5,GC is awesome,"This is one of my more favorite George albums. One star is a grave injustice. It of course has his infamous place for my stuff routine, and along with a couple other things that had me rolling with laughter when I firste heard it."
5,"Frigidaire FAH12ER2T 12,000-BTU Through-the-Wall Air Conditioner with 10,000-BTU Heat and Electronic Controls",Product arrived as promised. Easily installed in new construction application. Works great! Price was significantly cheaper at Amazon than through local retailer.
5,A Dear Memory,"My parents read this to me every night as a little boy. I wanted none other each night as they put me to bed.Now I will try it with our new grandchild, and possibly read it to young kids at my parish. It was a warmreassurance as I went to a peaceful sleep.It must be good, as I still have it and remember it fondly over sixty years later.Fr. Jim"
2,potential wasted,"This was a theme that has been well explored in the past, just not in this particular ethnic sub-context. It mixes ""Asian"" groups to create an Asian community that only exists in the United States, blends in many of the ""old world"" bits and behaviors on the part of elders and the newly arrived, but misfires in focusing on what they do, why they do it, and limits itself to only part of the story, not necessarily the best part.Not great, but at least somewhat interesting."
4,Pretty good,"Sometimes a little hard on first viewing to know which adults corresponded to which kids as the movie progresses in time...Kind of a standard gangster themed movie, but some portions were extremely touching. My 14 year old son liked it alot."
2,it not long,Its not what they show I think u have to buy too or three scarf for that go to fabric store and buy
4,Curtain was just right.,"I got one of the small sizes - the curtain fit great in a small kitchen window over a sink, without hemming, which was exactly what I wanted. The sheer material is a basic polyester, but does the job."
4,Worked perfect,"Product just as described, worked really well for my odd shaped window. Quality is good for the price, happy with purchase."
3,Jason Aldean,"I love the mature Jason Aldean. This is his earlier work and was good for then...but nothing like he is now. he gets better and better with age. This is great evidence of the development of a great musician;. Where he was then versus where he is now.Today Jason Aldean has developed so much that I really can't listen to his earlier work, although it was good.. He should redo this one now with the same songs as these are great songs worth of redoing. Well I know have some of his earlier work and it's not too shabby.E Sweeney Cleveland, OH"
3,"""You like the way that sounds?"" - Thank Big and Rich","I had heard Aldean's songs on the radio, and liked them, so I figured I would buy the CD. The first three tracks are the radio cuts, and hold no surprises. The rest of the CD is quite solid as well. My biggest issue is that if you listen to later tracks that Aldean actually had a hand in writing, the vocals pop and come to life much better. The songs aren't as strong, but the vocals have far more emotion to them. I had heard Aldean had paid his dues to now, and this was his break, but in the words of David Allen Coe 'can make folks feel what ya feel inside.' If he can't, he needs to go back to the drawing board. Otherwise, you become an overglorified karoke singer. Hopefully his sophmore effort remedies this, and the producers let the reins loose a bit. Actual rating would be 3.5 stars."
3,Mongoose Chill review,"Good quality materials, I like the aluminum wheels, no chance for rust. Craftsmanship ok, handlebars are not welded properly so they don't look straight to my 8 yr old. The rest of the bike seems very nice so far. I would cautiously recommend."
5,Drew Barrymore,"I loved this movie when I watched it after school when I was alot younger, When I seen it I had to buy it. It is funny, romantic and very truthful in alot of ways. This is a must watch."
1,US army survival handbook,"Not worth the bucks. Old, out of date info, but if you're a kid, say under 15, it might be fun to read."
2,Really disappointed,"I love Manic Panic, I think they're a great company and they make great products, so I was expecting more out of this when I used it. When I bleached my hair prior to using this dye, the bleach didn't entirely take, so I would warn people that unless your hair is platinum blonde, you won't get any pink in your hair but a little tint. And it washed out after two showers."
2,Not what it used to be 15 yrs ago.,"I'm really disappointed with this dye. 15 years ago this was THE dye, and now it fades uber fast and stains hands even after the initial dyeing was done at a salon. I used this on professionally bleached hair and the dye covered unevenly; it was dark blue at the middle and ends of the hair but sky blue at the roots. It faded greenish in a week even with good care and looked kind of cool while it was fading, but it faded way too fast for my taste. The only reason why it gets 2 stars is that does look kinda cool during the fade process but that time window is slim, like 1 or 2 days before it really starts looking shabby. I won't be using this brand of dye again, ever. Use Jerome Russell Punky Colour in Midnight blue instead, it's everything this dye wishes it could be."
3,Not as good as Punky,"I usually use Jerome Russell Punky Colour but I didn't want to order any because I was in a play and wanted turquoise to match my outfit for one of our dances(it was the only one where I showed my hair). My hair was red before. I didn't bleach because I wanted a deeper blue with purple tones in it. I got exactly what I wanted! But it has only been two weeks and has faded more than Punky does. Normaly my hair would still be perfectly vibrant. It has faded to green at my roots, which doesn't bother me but it looks alittle strange with the purple. I plan on dyeing it blue from now on instead of red because it looks better on me because of my skin tone. But I will probubly just order a couple of jars of Punky next. This stuff is great if you like to change your colors alot. I would sugest using Suave Keratin Infussion Color Care shampoo and conditioner and washing in cold water every 2-3 days for it to last longer."
4,"Wonderful Color, Bit of a Hassle","I use this to stain my hair, giving i don't bleach it, and the color is wonderful. On my light brown hair when left on for 2 hours with a bit of heat used, it gives a color very alike the color of Ariel's (The Little Mermaid - Lol :))bright red hair. I love this color and i'll be using it for a while.The only hassle, is giving that i am a swimmer the chlorine fades the color out fast. So i have to re-stain it quite often, and it gets EVERYWHERE. Trust me, i love this stuff to death, but my hands will be stained for a while and your shower water will be blood red with the first one or two washes.Hope this helps :)"
5,good resource,I was taught that fear appeals didn't work but we used them anyways in our state health department work. This book explains what we instinctively knew -- that fear appeals work and they work well given the right conditions. I like the theory in the book and the worksheets.
5,Great spoons for soft boiled eggs!,These are the perfect size for getting the egg out of the soft boiled egg. The handles are the perfect length for me. I think it would be awkward if they were longer.
5,Terific threesome,"What's to say about John Wayne? We've seen these movies many times, have owned them in VHS and now are very happy with this three pack in DVD. We do watch our favorites over again and this DVD will be used often. It came promptly and in great shape and we recommend this to anyone."
5,"""Goodbye Mr. Books""","Champion performances from Wayne in all 3 films. Wayne should have been nominated for The Shootist. A missed call on Hollywood's part, but a tremendous value for these must-have movies."
1,Moldy,"About half of the crusts I received had mold on them. Included in the box was a letter from the company saying that occasionally a crust doesn't meet their standards, so you can send them back to the company if you have a problem. They mention nothing about covering the shipping, so it would hardly be worth it. My assumption is that if they're including this letter, they're aware of the problem. So, why don't they fix it? I'm hesitant even to eat the ones without the mold because I worry they're all on the verge of molding and just haven't shown their true colors yet!"
3,"Good read, but not great","While this book was endorsed by Janet Evanovich as the ""feel-good book of the year"", it had the normal romance plot and didn't really grab my interest. It was a good fun read, but not the best I've read. Try a book by Evanovich, Jennifer Crusie, or Susan Elizabeth Phillips if you're looking for something great."
4,Glad to be speaking...,"i just wanted to take a moment and tell you all that I love this program, It does what it says and is about 90-95% acurate right out of the box. I would positivly buy it again.....Thank you...."
5,For $99.99 you cannot go wrong!,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It saves me everyday! As a student, at lectures, it is amazing! I use this product to update myself on notes I may have missed in class! With a great recorder, this product will transcribe notes onto my MP3 player in no time what so ever. It takes some time to get use to - don't get me wrong. Some of the notes are a little wonky. For example, ""ice cream"" instead of ""I scream"" but if you have any knowledge of the class you are in, this product saves lives. If it wasn't for Dragon I would have been working as tech support my whole life! My internship is at a university teaching economics! I never would have thought this possible if I didn't have Dragon to take me through my workouts, my walks to school, my transit rides, etc. It has truly gotten me through class!"
1,Not what you think,"You read so many reviews on this product and think, ""wow this will be great for my needs"". The truth is that if you are using it to type meeting minutes, it's no good. I picks up so much backround noise, any little thing, and then it types the wrong words and strange phrases. If you are looking to dictate in a really quiet place then this is a good product for you but, it's a no go for meetings minutes."
1,Voice Recognition? Yes. Computer Input? No.,"Perhaps the most non-functional software I have ever purchased. While it's voice recognition seems to work just fine the command interface does not work at all. Biggest failure is the ""Press Key"" command. ""Press Enter"" for example just puts those words in as text and the enter key is never pressed. Each time the software is used it seems to lose more functionality. Things that sometimes worked when first installed now do not work at all. This is a product that should be avoided unless you like to just throw money away. If you feel a need to do just that, go ahead and buy ""NaturallySpeaking 8 Preferred"" but do not install it. You have been warned."
5,Les,"I was skeptical at first because it was just a disc. However, this was probably the most reliable of all the 3rd party vendors in the history of Amazon. VERY QUICK delivery, disc was fine, so was serial number, etc. And, no, I am not related to the seller, and yes, I shop on Amazon all the time 1-2 orders per week. Les"
1,Wrong Vehicle and Missing parts,"Site claimed it would fit my 2000 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4.0L 6 cylinder but it did not. Plugs were wrong, did not use distributor, wires were wrong, did not include the fuel filter or the PCV valve or the point set. Even if it did fit my vehicle the fact that it was missing parts is reason enough not to buy it. Picture shows the fuel filter and it was not in the kit. Wrong kit, bad description, and missing parts that were listed in print and in the picture, not much more to say than that."
4,Silver Flower gets a Gold,"Silver Flower speaks with much the same voice as Circus Mind's debut CD. A Louisianna Steely Jam Bandish kind of sound where funky grooves, catchy hooks and great musicianship keeps this new group original and fresh. I highly recomend it."
2,Bit Lacking in Soul,"A harsh headline, perhaps, but there are so many other wonderful Goldbergs out there it would be a sin to start with this one. I imprinted on the Gould interpretations (1955, 1981) so am perhaps partisan, but I've found wonderful humanity in other recordings, notably that of Igor Kipnis. I had read that Tureck's style had influenced Gould, so I had high expectations. Those poor people that say Bach is boring, monotonous, mechanical -- they've probably been forced to listen to interpretations like this. I wish it were otherwise, but this sounds like a piano teacher. No clear artistic message comes through. It's technically refined, though slow in tempo. The overall impression is - no soul, no swing, no message. A Goldberg that fails the Turing test. Forgive me!"
2,catatonic,"If you like your Bach keyboard music slow, this is your performance. Two cd's because it's over 90 minutes. Even with repeats this is turgid. Mechanical sounding, a piano roll at half speed. One of my least favorite Goldberg's."
2,...and Bach would have preferred Gould anyway.,"Rosalyn Tureck's great claim to fame is that she was one of the (many) influences on a young and still unknown Glenn Gould. Now that the tables have turned somewhat, one wonders if Tureck herself had hoped to a forge a seminal re-recording of the Goldberg Variations in Gouldian fashion with this latest release. Sadly, this album falls short of even her own earlier performances of the work. Tureck's playing, which never bore the stamp of genius to begin with, now seems to have lost its unique tactile control as well."
2,breaker breaker ... an understatement,"I've owned these FRS radios for less than 6 months and they have had to be sent in for repair of the radio electronics twice. Also, the cover which holds the batteries in is constantly falling off. When they are working, they work fine. The channel lock feature is nice, as is the button which allows you to listen when the incoming signal is not strong enough to be detected. If you're looking for something reliable, you may want to consider others."
3,A Little for Alot,This book is quite miss leading. 113 easy-to perform miracles boils down too about 5 basic magic tricks with dozens and dozens of variations. Although these tricks are essential for future card tricks I think its not worth it.
2,NOT PILATES,"I hate to be the lone dissenter as everyone else seems to love this DVD, but I was very disappointed with it. From the title, I was expecting PILATES workouts. To call it a Pilates DVD borders on false advertising. Maybe 20% of the content is bastardized Pilates, while the rest is a mish-mash of yoga, calisthenics, and weightlifting moves. I would never have bought this DVD if the packaging had accurately reflected the contents.I gave it 2 stars only because it is an okay workout. I prefer10 Minute Solution Yoga. But if you want actual Pilates, tryPilates - Beginning Mat Workout. That one is a 20-minute Pilates workout, with a separate 10-minute ""Power Boost"" Pilates workout for those days when 10 minutes is all you can squeeze in--and it is REAL Pilates. (Yes, I AM a Pilates purist/""snob""!)"
4,"Great dvd, a little bit harder to follow than her last one, but a great work out.","Her first tape must have been for beginning beginners like me, this is supposed to be more intermediate, but I think I missed some inbetweens. After using it daily for almost a month now, I am used to it and prefer it over the first one as it is a much better all around work out. I love her style."
2,Not good for me,I feel strange expressing my discontent with this dvd among so many stellar reviews. The test of whether I like an exercise dvd has much to do with the instructor. I find her delivery unappealing.
2,NOT for beginners,"I'm sorry gals. I tried to like this one. I do like the instructor. But these positions are impossible for a beginner. I have tried more than once, but if I am not at the top of my game physically and mentally, I cannot complete a single set. And with two small children, I often come to the mat preoccupied and tired. If you are a beginner, I urge you to try to rent or borrow first."
4,GOOD,"I like this DVD; it's a great workout. I'm not flexible, though, and some of the moves are pretty difficult or impossible for me. A couple of the segments have things I can't do. On one of the segments, I think I'll be able to work up to it eventually, but the other one, I don't think I'll ever be able to do. I just skip what I can't do. There are a lot of moves I do like. Overall, I've enjoyed it."
4,"Beautiful, but inadequately packaged","As the other reviewers have noted, the singing on this CD is beautiful, and I have certainly enjoyed listening to it. However, the liner notes are inadequate. Most of the other opera CDs i own are accompanied by a fairly substantial little book, with the libretto in the original language and English. This recording has a brief synopsis of the action in each scene, and a few other notes, but is only a few pages. If, like me, you enjoy sitting down and following the action in text while listening, you might prefer another version of this opera."
4,EXCELLENT ADVENTURE!!,James V. Smith is a gifted action/adventure writer hands down. This 1st in an exciting series is a non-stop adventure with quite the interesting characters. Swayne and his small team of Force Recon team are up against everything from extreme weather to extremists group terrorists.For those of you out there that like action/adventure at its best - this one's for you!
3,A disappointment,"Maddie Kent is out for revenge and Tyler Delacourt is a means to the end. Feeling her father had been wronged years ago by Tyler's father Maddie decides to get even. Tyler is Maddie introduction to Bryce Delacourt. Instead of getting the revenge she thought she deserved, Maddie opened a whole new set of problems that changed everything for Tyler. I've read the entire series of Baby Makes 3, the Next Generation, and the Delacourts. Of the series this one was the worse. I never found the attraction between Tyler and Maddie. I never found the flow of the story. In the end you knew Tyler and Maddie would get together but, I didn't understand it. They never seemed to fit, especially considering Maddie told lies for most of story. As I said I was disappointed in this installment of a very good series."
2,good looks - mediocre sound,This gutless boombox looks great and is loaded with features. Poor reception and poor sound reproduction make it a poor choice for humans with ears that function.
5,great bottle,love the large size and the circumference is perfect for maintaining a good grip. top seals well and does not leak at all. the first time i drank from it i got water all down my face and onto my shirt.Guyot Designs SplashGuard-Universaltook care of that problem. this should be supplied with each of their bottles.
2,liver damage?,"have seen alot of stories of people that damage thier livers on a dr atkins diet.the diet works, if u stay on it, but at what cost to your long term health?"
4,Think about your money!,"You can always justify spending. And you can keep doing it until you are so broke or in debt that you are paying other people with money you could use. At its core, that's the message of Michelle's book. She's frugal, and even cheap, but she reminds people that she does so with goals in mind -- college for her three children, retirement on her terms, protection against fiscal disaster. Do you have a plan for your money, or does your money plan you? Read this book and answer that question."
5,A tightwad can learn from this book.,"This book has information that other books on thrift don't. You can tell that the author is personally thrifty which is a plus for books about money. In particular, there is information on taking care of disabled adults that some may find useful. I recommend this book."
1,A Whole Lot of Nothing,"This book costs 20 dollars, and the best financial advice you can get from it is YOU JUST WASTED 20 BUCKS.While her ""Mantras"" are more or less accurate, she relies on marketing rather than substance to sell her product. Given the vast numbers of financial books out there, you will do a whole lot better someplace else."
4,Not your ordinary tourist guide,"Where can you hear the first two notes of 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot' in Washington? On the Metro, that's where.That's just one of the little tidbits in this gem of a book, which I bought in 1983 just before I came to Washington for a three-month internship. I didn't return until 1999, but I kept the book as a good guide for my visits.Applewhite pulls no punches, disparaging some of the more modern office buildings in the federal part of the city (he's brutal on the Rayburn House Office Building), but giving a wonderfully rich guide to Embassy Row and other areas that not everyone visits.If you want something more than your average travelogue travelguide, get this. It'll help you fall in love with our Nation's Capital. I know it did that for me."
5,FANTASTIC PRODUCT,"I've tried them all. Glucosomine 1500mg + MSN 1500mg + Chondroitin etc. ,......... and after a hard night of weight training or karate sparring (I'm in my 40's) the shoulders joints felt like I had sand in them.This product is the only one that actually took away all my shoulder pain. I've been using it for nearly 18 months now. It's a bit expensive, but if you're a serious fitness fanatic like yours truely, this is the ONLY way to go.It took about 2 and a half weeks before my joints felt this stuff kick in."
3,"Great Seller, OK book","It is to no offense to the seller- the book arrived on time and in great, promised condition (thanks!) but the book itself is a little confusing. I was shopping for a mythology book that was simple and really easy to read. This does the job, but still probably better from someone with a pre-understanding of mythology and a serious interest in learning more."
3,Nice Blindfold,"It doesn't fit on her as well as it fits on the pictured model, but I guess that was to be expected."
4,Chillingly sublime,"The authors have a hit with this one!! Their second novel to date will generate chills as the reader explores the inner psyche of Stewart Douglas, who puts ""creepy"" on the map in Savanah. I will eargerly await the arrival of the third novel."
3,Black History,This product has some interesting information. I thought as a whole the product fine. I look forward to more products from this company.
4,"Dr. Ruth, Move Over. Waay Over","Jim and Louella are a fifty-plus couple who experience an i-n-c-r-e-d-i-b-l-e sexual re-awakening, after Louella consults with her savvy female ancestors in a dream. The advice she gets is pretty much Masters and Johnson sex therapy, but does it work? Wow! Not only do they become the hottest couple in the neighborhood, they develop psychic powers! They can hear other people's thoughts, and so, they begin a healing ministry of love.So far, so good. But as the story goes on it does begin to drag a bit. The dialect (""we just country folks"") gets a little old, and the down-home, rambling chatter of Louella becomes almost tiresome. Still, I enjoyed it and recommend it to you.Not really a novel, more like a long short story, an extended parable about love and its power to change the human heart. Take it for what it is, a sentimental, mystical, romantic, spiritual journey, and you will enjoy it. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber"
3,Still Worth the Read,I enjoyed this book. I did not enjoy her tangents. This is a good quick read. Pick it up (used) if you come across a copy.
5,"Yes, It Really Is For Beginners","This is by far the best intro to Foucault I've read. Thinking like Foucault use lots of complex language and have really complex ideas, but this book explains those ideas in a very easy-to-understand way. It's short, so you'll be finished quickly, but you will get a really good (introductory) sense of Foucault's entire project. That sense will stick with you pretty well, too, because every page is illustrated. This is an important thinker, and I can't imagine a better introduction. Read it."
3,BASIC BASIC Foucault,This was an extremely superficial look at Foucault. It was more a top line summary of what Foucault's works focused on and who Foucault was as an individual.
2,"Derivative, whiney","Cast from the same rough, sloppy mode as ""Surf's Up,"" this one is a drag. I have heard the reformed Beach Boys live several times in recent years and they are much, much better (""That's Why God Made the Radio"")."
3,This book is NOT by Norbert Shadeg,"Although Norbert Shadeg is listed as the author, he is not. The vast majority of this dictionary has been copied verbatim from ""A Balinese-Englih Dictionary"" by C. Clyde Barber, Aberdeen, 1979, of which I have a copy. Father Shadeg, whom I knew well before he died a few years ago, may have edited the Barber book. But, if he did so, it is not apparent. This fact does not detract from the usefulness of the book. However, users will have to accustom themselves to the fact that Barber lists all words that begin with vowels under the letter ""h"". He also lists all words beginning with ""ng-"" after the last entry under the entries beginning with letter ""n""."
2,More like a research paper than a book,"I picked this book for my engineering ethics class thinking how great it would be to read about the experience of other females in engineering. To my dismay the book was slow and repetitive. The books studies white American women in science. The data through out the book is presented in a rough research paper like format. This is not a peasant to read book. If you can identify with white American women in the scientific field, then read this book. Otherwise the focus of this book is too narrow and the authors of the book does not present any practical solutions to the problems encountered by women in the scientific field."
1,I Wonder,"Haven't read the book. And probably won't. My mother that it was David, who was abused not the other way around. There are news reports to verify it."
4,this book is kind of boring,"I like this book but this book was not exciting. I think this book just told us how Narnia created, so this book is not that exciting. I say this book is boring.In this book Polly met Digory and his uncle, so she went to the different world and Digory and Polly met Queen Jadis. Polly and Digory brought her to their world, so she mess around and they brought her to wood between the worlds. They went to nothing land. Then they saw the lion create the world by song and Digory had mission to get an apple. Finally, Digory cured his mom."
4,Magic Magician,The Magicians Nephew was all about magic. Theirs these rings that Digory's (the main characater)uncle made. They transport you to other worlds. Then Digory and his friend Polly go to an evil enchanted world called charn. Were they find the witch. She follows them back to London and trys to take over London. They fight and all end up in Narnia by touching the rings.I loved the writing and the characters personality. Some times it could be a little weird and unreal but thats what you get with a fantasy.I would definatly compare this book to C. S. Lewis's second book in this series The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.
5,Completely Enjoyable!,"C.S. Lewis is a master at spinning a tale of intrigue for young people. This book was so much fun to read. I love writing; this book made me love it even more. As an author who loves to create alternate worlds for readers to explore, I can learn so much from C.S. Lewis.Digory and Polly embark on an adventure leading them to other worlds - new and old - in a novel that may have been written for children, but holds up well for adults...at least this adult thinks so. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun journey."
3,Short and to the point,"This book, the last written in the series, but first chronologically, does a good job of going back to show where the white witch originally came from and how she got to Narnia. It's imaginitive and moves along at a brisk pace. What it does not do is enthrall. It's short and easy to read but I never continued reading becuse I felt like I had to know what was going to happen next. It's decently written, although not with an abundance of style, and I finished it only because of its brevity. I enjoyed it, but it never completely grabbed my attention."
4,My Opinion Cody B.,"I think that the book ""The Magician's Nephew"" is an ok book to read. The author showed how well he/she's imagination is. This book has its ups and downs however, I would rate this book a 4 because of authors other works, some are better some are worse. Some good points from the book are that it connects to the second book (The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe). One of my favorite chapters in this book was The bell and the hammer, because Digory and Polly have a fight over if they should strike the bell. Another chapter I liked was Stawberry's Adventure because Strawberry the donkey finally is chosen to be a talking animal. I liked the way the author wrote because I could follow the book easily. There was only one thing in this book I really didnt care for and that was - I thought Aslan came into the story too late in this book. Overall, this book was very fun to read."
4,The chronicles of Narnia the magicians newphen,I thought that this book was a bit slow but in the end it turned out to be pretty good
4,3rd Graders say its a must-read,"The Magicians Nephew is a great book because you enter a magical world that is entertaining. The main characters are Digory and Polly. They are on a quest to save Digory's mom. They need to go to Narnia to get the medicine to cure his mom. Each time you read a page it gets better and better, it's a real page turner!Written by 3rd graders in Lara Academy"
5,Great Prequel!,"This book was an amazing start to the collection of the Narnia novels. I strongly recommend that you read this book before the others, just like the author recommended as well. It introduces the starting of Narnia and how it was born. It is an easy-paced novel and keeps your interest from start to finish. It's a very magical story and is just as good as The Lion, the witch, and the Wardrobe. My rating: 5 stars."
5,The outside world,"The Magician's Nephew is an excellent way of starting the wonderful series of The Chronicles of Narnia. This wonderful book is about two curios children named Digory and Polly. One day, they both crept curiosly through a tunnel where they ended up at a door which was a door that lead to Digorys' Uncle's Study room. When they were inside the room, they saw green rings and yellow rings. Suddenly Digory's uncle appeared. Both Polly and Digory wanted to leave because they suddenly felt a feeling that made them think magic was dealing with a project that uncle Andrew was trying to suceed.He found Polly looking at the rings so he gave one yellow one to her and gave one to Digory. Together they found a world(After going to a few other worlds) that was being born and Digory had happilly found a cure for his dieing mother. This book of adventure-fantasy is for all ages."
5,Fabulous Introduction to an Enthralling Series,"Mad Uncle Andrew that thinks he's a magician, gives Polly and Digory rings that will transport people from world to world. After the children got to Charn and mistakingly awake and take evil Queen Jadis, she wants to take over all of London. Uncle Andrew thinks she is beatiful. Immediatley Jadis starts trouble and the police come. Polly and Digory take Jadis using the rings to the woods between the worlds and mistakingly take Uncle Andrew, Cabby, and Strawberry, a horse. They go into Narnia while Aslan, a lion, is creating the world. I won't give the rest of this miraculous book away. The Magician's nephew is a fabulous book with a great plot, story and has a lot of depth. Any reader that loves Harry Potter will definitley enjoy this enthralling series. C.S. Lewis is a master storyteller. Read these miraculous books now! You'll love them"
2,I loved the look of the watch,"....but looks were deceiving. I was disapointed in the function of the watch.It would run for a day, and then all of a sudden stop working.Then it would be running again. I can't wear a watch I can't trust."
3,"Pretty, but tight on a medium-large wrist.","I liked the looks and price of this and decided to take a chance, even though I have a 6-1/2 in. wrist. It's pretty and versatile, but I have to agree with some other reviewers that the band is too short for anything above a medium wrist, and it's difficult to get on (my glove size is 8, the largest woman's glove size).The band is smooth inside and doesn't pinch the skin, so I'll wear it to see if it's comfortable in spite of the short band. However, I may have to return it. It's a nice watch, but not worth paying a jeweler to add a couple of links."
1,the product was broken,"I read reviews and decided to buy this mask for present. The delivery was late, I received it on 3 days later . After open the box, I was really disappointed. The mask was deformed and plastic frame contains the crack. Of course it can't be used as present. Beautiful mask but terrible packing and delivering."
2,Get a different Polaroid - this design is bad,"We got this for my 4 year old nephew to learn photography. He understood the mechanism well except that you have to manually remove the film after you take a shot. I kept forgetting this as well! If you do not remove the film, you just take another picture over the other one. This camera design is somewhat flawed, there should be a better fail safe mechanism.Get a different Polaroid. Don't get me wrong, Polaroids are great for kids though! My nephew is a definitely budding photographer."
3,LITTLE LAURA & BIG JOHN,THIS MOVIE WAS FILMED ON LOCATION IN MY TOWN AND MY GRANDFATHER AND FATHER HAD WALK ON PARTS IN THE FILM AND I WAS EXCITED TO SEE IT ON DVD..
5,Excellent,This is the absolute most relaxing classical composition of music that my ears have ever had the pleasure of being caressed by. Each note slides off the speakers like hot butter and sooths you to a deep sense of oneness. There is no other clasical music out there that is this soothing.
1,misleading title,"There is some good music on this CD, but most of it is not relaxing. I would not recommend this CD to anyone I know.The pieces are all quite short, and the album in general felt sort of ""jumbled"" together.Listen to many different samples before you consider purchasing."
1,Too much vocal music,"I'm afraid I hated this collection. I was looking for relaxing music for the end of my pregnancy, labor, and the early days of childraising. Unfortunately, it wasn't clear from the description that there is a LOT of vocal music on this collection. I don't know about other people, but I don't find a mix of vocal and instrumental to be relaxing. The cuts between the pieces are very jarring. You might be able to edit this into a good collection, but, as is, it's more startling than relaxing."
5,this will calm you down,"Hi everybody out there. Guess what. This cd is wonderful. I am a VERY discerning ear for classical music. I usually don't go for the ""BEST OF"" collections. But ya know what...sometimes ya just need the ""overplayed"" stuff to calm you down. I mean, for some of these pieces, there are better performances out there. But, that doesn't really matter when you're just wanting to relax. This is great for someone learning about classical music. It will give you a good sense of what you might like in the future. who cares if it's not the TOP performers, i am not displeased with any of the tracks. it always does the trick when i need it to. :)"
4,Quirky,"Never having heard of Millicent this CD was a surprise. I bought it for ""Moonglow"" and she really delivers on that number. There were a few songs I found surprising and maybe out of place. But she is a good singer, none the less. If you like discovering new-to-you talent singing some standard songs, then this will fit the bill."
5,This CD brought me back to country!,"Over the last five years I was a bit hard pressed to find a country CD that I felt was worth buying. But THANK YOU Sugarland; Enjoy the Ride was just what I needed!!I can't say enough good things about this CD...from Jennifer Nettles voice to the instruments to the hooks in each lyric...I am just infatuation with it all. And while I enjoyed their first CD, this one brought an even better evolution for Sugarland. Some of my favorite songs are: Settlin', Want To, These Are the Days, One Blue Sky, Stay and County Line. All in all I don't think there's a song here that I *don't* like though.I would definitely recommend this CD to a friend or a country fan! If it could renew my interest & excitement in country music...and have me walking around the house singing ""One Blue Sky"", or have me near tears listening to ""Stay""...well, this has my seal of approval!!"
3,"great group, poor song writing","I was disappointed with this album. The first album was great, but this one just doesn't have the ""spark"" the first one had.Don't get me wrong.The album is good and I would buy it, but I just played both albums and I do not get the good feeling that I felt with their first album."
3,It Could Be Better,"Normally if I like one song by an artist, I like most of their songs. But I can't seem to figure Sugarland out. I liked Baby Girl from there first CD but not really anything else. Then I stopped liking Baby Girl as much as I did. I HATE Stay. I sort of like Settlin', Want To, and Everyday America. But none of them scream ""SUGARLAND IS AMAZING!"", so I borrowed the CD because I liked All I Want to Do (from Love on the Inside) and thought, who knows I may enjoy some songs on this CD. Well none of them are really that great, but I can say I really like County Line.So if you really liked Settlin', Want To, Stay and Everyday America I'd give this CD a try."
2,Not a fan,"I actually bought this for a friend, I have given it a few listens but was not impressed. Its not my type of coutry."
3,"Great blanket, eye mask- not so much","The blanket is very nice. However, I didn't like the eye mask at all. It's very thin, poorly made and smashes down eyelashes. For this I went for Buckys 40 blinks eye mask; ultra light contoured foam, allows blinking, smudge-free eyes and seals out light. For traveling add a pair of good ear plugs and happy sleeping/napping."
5,Warm work wear,The person I bought this for wears his to work and he works in construction. He says it's very warm and lightweight and enjoys it.
3,Energy Star is nice - Quality not so much,"Eagerly awaited the arrival of this unit, and we have it permanently mounted into the window of our kids room - its once of the only machines that would fit our 50's Andersen casements without carpentry work - the machine works fine, its fairly quiet, and the Energy Star features are nice - it does maintain temperature while switching the compressor AND fan on and off. My gripe is quality - for a machine that's almost $400, every seam is askew, the interior insulation is visible through the front, the panels are all warped, the front isn't aligned with the sides, there are gaps in the frame to the sides of the machine, and the outside air vent was pretty much broken from the get-go - its always open. I'd buy another - but only because I'd HAVE to."
4,Solid Knife... Bad Design.,"This is a solid knife by Buck. I bought mine at a flea market for $3. Holds an edge really well. The rubber grip makes it easy to hold, but it also feels bulky in your pocket and grips the inside of your pocket as well if it is in there. Other draw backs are that there is a metal piece inside the handle where the tip of the blade lands that the tip will hit and makes it dull alot quicker than it should. And there is no assisted opening at all such as a thumb stud or even a finger nail groove. Great knife for what I purchased it for but you really have to grip the blade tight to open it."
5,Beautiful,I got this bracelet for a gift for a friend who has breast cancer. It is absolutely beautiful. It even came it a pink box that I thought was adorable too. I was definitely pleased with my purchase.
4,Decent for the price,"This pillow does well to serve my gerd needs. I am small so it works well for me, however, I think perhaps a larger person might have a hard time lying their arms beside them on the pillow. I do like the versatility of the pillow, as well. You can place it in at least 3 positions that work well."
3,"A bit too small and bit too ""stiff"" for me: 6'1"" & 170 lbs w lower back pain","Pro's:Seems durable.Unique""U"" contour for cradling back & shoulders.""Egg crate"" surface.Dual position use (Laying down as a ""wedge"" and sitting upright as a back rest).Con's:To narrow for my arms to rest along side my body.""U"" contour used when wedge is prone is stiff (too firm), esp around shoulder area, and uncomfortable for my lower back pain.Not as long as I would like to run from just above my butt up to my head, supporting my lower back comfortably.My ""significant other"" didn't find it very comfortable either. (5'4"") and gave it back after one nite.Back comfort is such an individual thing I suggest you try this before just dismissing it. If you don't like it: Amazon is great about returns."
3,nice but could be wider,"Have been using this for a week so far, it's mindly better than stacking your pillows up. The pillow is just a bit too narrow (I'm 6'6"") to allow much movement, I tend to turn at night and found it bothersome at times. I also had to air out the pillow with a fan on it as the smell of glue was a bit overpowering."
4,Intresting Book...,"I recently recieved this book and I personally have to say that I thought that this was one of the more intresting and emotional book that I've read regarding Columbine in over 3 years. I thought that it was illuminating how this people dealt with what happened over the past 6 1/2 years(the positives and negatives) and this was worth reading.However, I find that the major weakness of this book(at with most books that were released over the past 3 years regarding Columbine with the exception of the ""No Easy Answers"" book) is that most people from the ""outside world"" who are still intrested in what happened and especially why(who would buy the book) won't be wholly satified by the book and I believe that this is more to marketing than anything else.With that weakness aside, I think that this is a very good read and I think that people should get this book."
4,Kept me guessing!,"Russ, is a gay man, a changeling, a shapeshifter and possible an immortal. He will never age and is able to have any man he desires, whenever he desires. Unfortuately, our sexy, gorgeous ever-young man is tired of the game and wants a real relationship and true love.Another interesting character is Russ's mother.I enjoyed this off-beat story. The reader doesn't know where it will lead.sexy, erotic,shocking"
3,Worthless instructions.,"As noted elsewhere in the reviews for this product, the written instructions are terrible. If you have some mechanical skill, or know someone who does, it's quite possible to install this unit. On my bike, I had to remove the rear wheel in order to bolt the lower connection point to the bike, because the bolts have to be inserted from the inside. The top connection point on my bike was the handle of the fork that goes from the seatpost to the rear hub. There were two bolts, one on either side of the fork handle - I removed them, then reattached them with the attachment arms of the rack on the bolts.This seems to be a good quality product - well designed and sturdy."
2,"Very interesting subject matter, poorly presented","The only reason I give this book 2 stars is that I feel the authors did a great job of disclosing very interesting theories (or facts?) about the UFO 'conspiracy'. The story and characters are very very poorly written however. In fact, the quality of the book (separated from the subject matter) is SURPRISINGLY BAD. I would recommend this book to people who are sincerely interested in UFO conspiracy theories. To anyone else, I would say STAY AWAY."
3,I guess I was looking for something else.,Having seen the TR3b in person I believe most of what was said up to that point. The alien stuff I found a few problems with. Homo Erectus came from Cro-Magnon not Neanderthal. If aliens really wanted to spread the truth they could land in my front yard. And the characters drank too much.
1,"Hokey, Boring and Loooooong","I'm astounded at the amount of good reviews for this book. The storyline is ridiculous and completely CORNY. Sabine spends her entire adult life in love with a gay man and when he dies, she spends the entire book mourning his loss - she was a third wheel!! His secretive family is revealed after his death and this is when the book gets completely nauseating. This book just dragged on and on and on. What a complete waste of my time."
2,"Long, dull...I don't care about most of the characters","I was 25% into the book and was bored. I never do this, but I glanced forward 50 pages and thought, 'ok, that sounds interesting'....It wasn't. I couldn't figure out where the story was going. I kept trying, hoping something would pick up. By 75% through the book, I had to force myself to keep going. I gave up, came on to Amazon and read enough reviews to say, ""omg"". I'm done. Live is too short, there are too many books out there!What editor let this one get published?"
2,Kept waiting for something to happen... Disappointed.,"At first this story captured me. Parsifal died and the main character, Sabine, is heart-broken. You truly felt her grief for the loss of the ""love of her life.""The problem with the story is that nothing really happens. I kept reading the book and waiting for ""it."" Waiting.. waiting... Exactly when you think ""it"" has happened, it turns into nothing.This is a story with no climax. It is an easy read, and while Sabine is truly enduring, this story was a disappointment.This is now the second (and very likely the last) Ann Patchett book I have read. I feel neither book lived up to the reviews."
4,Grab this book and curl up with a fuzzy bunny!,"--I was not a fan of Bel Canto, but I was directed into giving Ann Patchett another chance. I am so pleased that I picked up Magician's Assistant!The book opens with the sad death of Parsifal, the great magician,then the story turns to focus on his wife, and assistant, Sabine. Sabine struggles with grief, secrets, discoveries and realization of her own worth.You will become wrapped up in Sabine's life and struggle to understand her grief and her newest journey!--I do not want to spoil the book, but inbetween the loss, the secrets, there lies a world to behold, a world to get lost in. You will not want to put it down!"
5,Outstanding Read,This is a great book to fall into on a Sunday afternoon. Ann Patchett is a master at weaving a beautiful story.
3,This book is not great but it is not bad either.,"This book held my interest enough for me to read it however I wouldn't call it a must read or even tell my friends to try it. The author leads you into the story with a skill level that promises a great tale. However once the main characters are introduced and the core circumstances established, a looseness develops and a subtle sense of drudgery sets in and one starts hoping for something better. It isn't the subject matter that is lacking--it's the story telling. ."
1,No Magic Here,"After total entrancement with Patchett's ""Bel Canto"" perhaps I was expecting too much from this book. Behind the flashy prose, time shifting gimmickry and mundane dream/reality superimposition there is a simple and not particularly appealing story. Very slow reading and very little reward for sticking it through to the end.Read ""Bel Canto"". Let this one disappear."
2,There is no Walmart in Alliance Ne.,There is no Walmart in Alliance NE. If an author is going to use a real setting for their story--she needs to make sure their facts are right. I couldn't accurately judge the story because of the factual errors.
2,disappointing,"Ms Brown's newest book was a disappointment to me. It seemed as though it were written in haste, without her usual polished prose. The first book about the Jefferson Hunt was marvelous..the second not quite as good.No doggy biscuit for this one.The Hunt Ball lacks cohesiveness and a strong plot..Big letdown at the end. The sentences either tend to be run-on or very simple ""Dick and Jane"". and a great deal of needless description ...and most strange; there were innumerable references to brands of car, dress, food , and even hunting clothes and horses tack. [...]"
2,disappointing Brown novel,I generally love Sandra Brown but this is just a monotonous romance novel. I quit reading it about 1/3 of the way through when nothing of interest had happened.
2,sunny chandler's return,"Sorry. I like Sandra Brown, but this was all sexual inuendos and not much more. I skipped thru and tried to read more but I had not missed anything. It was the same. I very rarely do not finish a book, but I could not get into this one. And yes I will continue to read Sandra Brown unless this is going to be her style."
3,"Predictable, pleasant yet somewhat poignant!","There is nothing unique about the plot of ""Sunny Chandler's Return"" that I haven't read in many-a-romance novel. This is one of the books that stays by my nightstands for reading to go to sleep. That said, I do think this is a pleasant read from Sandra Brown. Ty (the hero) is confident, almost bordering on the cocky state but he's got more substance that overides his unusual style of blunt delivery - my kind of guy. And he had an uncanny ability to see right through all the ""BS"" that surrounded Sunny's reason for leaving her groom at the altar. So at the end, one gets a lesson in life about a guy that's ""just not that into you."""
4,A must read for any baseball fan,"Maybe I'm a bit biased since two of the four players profiled in this book are now Mets, but I really enjoyed their stories. Siroty takes you from their childhoods through college, to the minor leagues and the majors. Every player has a different path, and not all of them have the traditional happy endings. Every page mentions a new player whose name you'll recognize - I always wondered how every baseball player seemed to know each other, even if their teams never competed. You'll love this book if you love baseball - because it really shows the players' passion for the game."
1,Broke after 2 uses...,"I got this for my husband who has occasionally has trouble with buttons due to a muscular autoimmune disease he has. The second time he used it, the wire button hook came out of the wooden handle. Very disappointed in the product."
3,IT'S JUST OKAY,I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH BUTTONING AND ZIPPING. THE BUTTON END OF THE PRODUCT WORKS WELL. THE ZIPPER END BROKE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. I DECIDED TO KEEP THE ITEM AND JUST CRAZY GLUE THE ZIPPER END INTO THE WOOD TO MAKE IT STRONGER. THE ITEM HAS BEEN A USEFUL ASSISTANT FOR ME.
4,good value,"works ok, except on shirts with tiny button holes where bh is too big. Why the h... do I have to use more words???I will write no more of these."
5,"Duro-Med Button aid/ Zip pull, wood, small",The part with the button aid is very helpful in buttoning any shirt or cuff or anything else that needs buttoning. the Zip pull part is good for helping to pull up or down zippers.
2,Many Errors Found in this book!,"This book has a tremendous number of errors. This should not be happening in a study manual for the NYS teaching exam. Most of the errors are in the Math Review section where the question doesn't match the solution! There are also errors in the Science Review. At one point a table doesn't match the questions! I have also found a couple of typos in direction paragraphs. The tips are good, but be aware of all the errors."
3,Each a matter of taste,"I had lost my copy of ""Beast"" and needed to replace it. Beast is one of Ray Harryhausen's early efforts that is worth the attention. Each movie is a Saturday afternoon full of fun."
2,"Great writing, bad errors","For those of you jumping into VB.NET for the first time, and specifically PROGRAMMING for the first time, this book is a very quick way to get your feet wet.The writing style is informal and approachable. I also found myself marking the book in several places to make it usable as a quick reference to common activities (particularly where they differ from VB6).However, the comments regarding errors are spot-on. I tried running the app (the one you build in the book using DataSets) from the book's CD-ROM even, and it didn't work! I quit reading after this, leaving a few chapters left. Unfortunately Hungry Minds doesn't seem to want to fix the problem???Starts good, ends bad. Get the Microsoft Step-by-step book instead..."
1,buggy book,"i bought this book to get a quick start with vb.net having c, c++ and mfc experience, i manged to get the examples to work, but i can see a beginner spedning hours trying to figure out why the sample code in lesson 6 does not work. this books practice bad programming technics in general."
1,BS,"no vitamins, no miracle products, no nothing will prevent you to have parasites, They are very ""intelligent"" and believe me is very difficult to get rid of these things. If someone tries to sell product saying that you have parasites inside is BS!!!! I am Parasitologist and this is just marketing with public fear"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"I purchased tree for my parents recently renovated home. The tree was so old, the white had turned yellow. The metal extensions that allow you to connect the four parts together was rusty and pretty much void of paint. The ""bubble-wrap"" and I use the term loosely was also discolored from age. It was held together with blue painter's tape. Their customer service is non-existent. WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY to my friends. A wasted $157.00!!!! This review is not a reflection of Amazon - just this particular company they chose to partner with."
3,"Definitely Audible, You Get Used To It","I have the SilverStone ML03B case for my HTPC and it holds up to four 80mm exhaust fans. With the components I jammed in there, I would like to use all four slots, just to be on the safe side. I ordered these because they were advertised as being barely audible. Imagine my disappointment when, after installing all four fans, my HTPC sounded like a dust buster. Okay, it wasn't that bad, but it does sound like a desk fan on low speed and I can definitely hear it humming away while I watch Netflix. I unplugged two of the fans and doing so cut the noise considerably.I'm sure that a single fan or even two fans are quiet enough for the casual user. I don't know how much silence I expect to get from an 80mm fan but in the end I am content."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought it would be more informative in general, but its very specific in it view and I did not agree with it. Not a good read."
5,Excellent Content/Easy to Read,"The first thing that pulled me in is it is colorful and easy to read. I started reading through it and the content is just as excellent as the astheticly pleasing look and feel. It has many superfoods listed. And it follows the USDA Food Pyramid, however supplements for vegitarians, etc... Has sections on best nutrition for each phase of your life (childhood, teen, for women--preconception and pregnancy, menopause, etc). Also great section of foods that cause common ailments and foods that cure them. Excellent choice and easy to read. :)"
3,"Calling them patterns is a stretch, but still useful","If you're looking for more patterns you've come to the wrong place. The ""patterns"" discussed in this book are typically 1-2 pages and have names like ""Symbolic Constant Name"" and ""Intention Revealing Method"". More ""tips and tricks"" or ""good coding styles"" then patterns. His first book holds more to the definition of patterns."
5,Delicious and Delightful,"My husband and I (both vegetarians) were lucky enough to be on a cruise in 1998 on which Mr. Pickarski was our chef. I had more delicious food during those six days than I ever had before or since! After we got home I ordered every Pickarski item I could get my hands on, this book included.Bear in mind, these distinctive, gourmet vegan recipes aren't your everyday fare. This is the book you'll want to pull out when you need to wow your non-vegetarian friends. My favorite is the Chocolate Cream Couscous Cake (page 220). Vegan or not, this is one of the most elegant and delicious desserts you can ever hope to taste. Happy eating!"
3,"Good concept, but...","As a child, my normal method of playing Chinese Jump Rope by myself, or with just one friend, was to utilize a set of chairs.This never worked as well as you might hope, and one seldom has chairs when one really needs them!The stakes in this solo set work great. Okay, you can't go up to calves, midthighs, and waist like you can when you're playing with friends, but they're still fine for just fun.The jump rope itself, though... not so much. It's not long enough for one - if you occasionally want to play with friends you'll have to use a new rope, and it's a little cramped for adult use anyway. Worse, it's attached in the middle with metal. As I know from wearing ponytails, the rubber bands with metal in the middle tend to snap apart at the worst times. The better ones, and better Chinese jump ropes, are just a solid circle with no obvious fastener.Still, it's easily remedied by buying a better Chinese jump rope or making your own with rubber bands."
4,Newbies to Dir en Grey be warned,"I love Dir en Grey and adore this album, but I will tell you I had mininul exposure to their music when I heard this album and I was nearly scarred away from the band. After listening to it over and over (as well as hearing other singles), this album grew on me and I now love it.Those that are new to Dir en Grey SHOULD NOT listen to this album first. It is extremely dark, hardcore and can be a it disturbing. Though some may be able to handle it, it's best to listen to the Macrabe or Vulgar albums to get a better taste of their style first before sixUGLY.I still highly reccomend this album- especially if you're really upset and need mood music. This album's perfect. ^_^"
5,Deeply moving,"The title novella, Hunger, is beautiful and deeply moving. I look forward to Chang's next book."
1,Awful costume jewelry,"This ring is a very cheap imitation of what nice rings are supposed to be--and a bad one at that. I could not believe how much it DID NOT look like the picture. It was poorly made, and the stone and ring materials were costume quality, not real jewelry quality. To top it all off, the ""silver"" came tarnished--a supposedly new ring came tarnished as though it was brought up from a shipwreck."
1,there are better books,"Ordinary to Extraordinary is a real bummer of a book that offers cliched and specific assignments that offer little room for creativity or really even learning. The assignments are more like student-to-technical-art-machine-converters. I don't imagine a student would get more out of these then a temporary increase in motor skills and a limited perspective for the possibilities of art. The fact that this book has received such high reviews worries me greatly--learning art is about learning to pay attention to the world and think critically and interpret what you see!!Oh, and I bought this at the same time as ""[ASIN:1590301056 100 Creative Drawing Ideas]"" which is a much better book. great reflective drawing assignments that really get kids to think and create for themselves."
1,JAZZ?..I DON'T THINK SO.,"Over here in the U.K Jamie Cullum is regarded as the saviour of jazz. Spoke of in awe by trendy magazines who wouldn't know a real jazz album if it crawled up and bit them. Firstly, he isn't jazz. It masquerades under that name in order to make jazz trendy and saleable. The guy is an uninspired pianists who would struggle to keep up with proper jazz musicians, his interpetations are bland, background music and do we really need more cover versions of jazz classics? When i had the misfortune to hear this i couldn't believe how dull it really was-it makes Kenny G seemed the natural succesor to John Coltrane. The saddest thing is gifted young jazz musicians struggle to make a living whilst this dross sells millions. Nostaglia?..don't think so, Pointless?..deffinately. Jazz Pianist?.. Monk would be turning in his grave."
4,Great for Frying Fish!,"I had always wanted to try Ghee, but never found it locally. I ordered it, tried it to fry some fresh haddock, and was amazed at the difference between it and the ordinary frying mediums I had used in the past.It also keeps so well right on the shelf. Glad I tried it."
3,Great Buy,This is a great deal on Ghee. However this particular ghee was separated when it arrived but it could have been because I ordered it in the summer. I put it in the refrigerator and it was fine.
4,Clearly interpreted,"Zinman's recordings are characterized by a clarity of articulation and an unwillingness to be unduly swayed by passion. These qualities lend themselves to very clearly and accurately performed pieces - A pleasing result, most of the time. With this Mahler, the combination of Zinman and the good accoustics make for a fine performance, however, it is lacking in the passion and gravitas characterized by other recordings. At times, the performance seems almost sterile and anticlimactic. If only Zinman would let the Tonhalle loose and crack a few eggs, then, an astonishing performance would be at hand. An interesting addition to the Mahler anthology."
5,Best router I own,"I own a couple of routers, and this is my favorite. The others are larger, more powerful, and have more features. This one though, is the one I find myself using most often. It has a better feel to it than the other Dewalt and Porter Cable routers I own, and is lighter and easier to manage. The rack-and-pinion depth adjustment knob is very simple to use, and in general I find Dewalt's approach to the depth adjustment mechanisms far superior than other approaches. The quality of this router is tremendous. There are cheaper 1-1/2HP fixed based routers on the market, but I think this one is the best."
5,Another fascinating book by Marie Warder,"Her characters are so real you want to shake them because of some of the antics they indulge in. She has woven another gripping tale - set in her beautiful South Africa - which is difficult to put down. She is a keen observer of human frailty and most, if not all, her characters are based on people she has known. The course of true love certainly does not run smooth, but the author manages to bring all the characters into their right places by the end. Enjoy!"
5,Perfect for food allergy kids on the go!,"My 9 yr old son with multiple food allergies loves this spaghetti! It is similar to spaghetti-o's (lots of sauce). I would not recommend this product for an adult as our taste buds are more particular and this does not compare to rice/corn pasta with a great pasta sauce. This is italian, gluten-free/dairy free convenience at its best for food allergy kids!"
1,don't like at all!,"very disappointed in product, was looking for something for kids to eat for a do-it yourself quick snack...they won't eat even with extra cheese added to the top..."
2,Not a repet purchase,I also had high expectations of this product. I was excited to have something for those days where I just did not want to cook. At first my kids eat it but I had to force them to finish off the cans. We will not buy this again. It smelled horrible. There was too much sauce and almost no noodles. It was horrible messy so we always had to have a bath after eating it. It would have been great if it actually looked like the lable on the can.
2,Nasty but convenient,"I really hated eating these, but they were very convenient for lunches. They fit inside a coffee cup for travel and I could easily open and flip the can contents into the cup for heating."
5,Do not requiered For my installation,"I really do not use the extra hose, But it could be very helpfull if you install far from transmission"
5,A Modern Classic in the Social Sciences,"As a graduate student I encountered this book on several levels over the years. I first bought it in India while doing anthropological fieldwork to catch up on theory. The applications on social inquiry to the ""Third world"" were very helpful, especially the section on views of the west in the post-Marxist era. More recenty I have read it with an interest in public policy, and found relevant insights on the nature of the public sphere. The glossary is unique in its throroughness. This book serves as a classic--elegantly written, comprehensively researched- and more importantly a useful guide to postmodern ideas for the working academic and student alike."
4,Mistakes,"This PSAT guide is extremely helpful in taking the PSAT test, but there are several mistakes in the answer guides for some practice math questions and several other questions in the practice tests that users should be aware of. These mistakes might be confusing to users who are unable to catch the mistakes and know the correct answers."
4,For Those Who Wonder,"My cousin was in the same regiment. However, he was never one to talk much of it. Ciliberti provides a very good accounting of most of the involvement of the 5/1 Marines in Korea, along with a fair dose of commentary from the soldier's point of view. It made good reading and I am glad some of my cousin's family also read the book. It is not so deep as to bog down the light reader, so even those not familiar with the military were enlightened. This is one of the Marine's greatest battles. Korea (the war) is so little understood by Americans. The book helps bring it into focus. A recent book ""The Last Stand of Fox Company"" is a good supporting book for this one - for the student of history who wants to dig deeper - especially into the Chosin Campaign. me3tv.org"
5,"Truly ""Magic""!","A great addition to my Photoshop library. I loved working through Foster's ""Photoshop Web Magic 2"" tutorials, but this book really showed me how to utilize the new features in version 6. Great animation effects too!"
3,"Okay , but not the usual A.D. standard","This song has a nice catchy tune but after track 1 it deteriorates a bit , oh yeah.If you didn't know already then load this CD on your compter and you will get one very cool enhanced video."
4,"Good, but annoying.","I'm in the process of reading Juror Number Eleven, and so far it's pretty good. However, I find the repeated interruptions of Sister Bernadette's voice in Mariread's head annoying. It breaks up the flow of the story. Sister Bernadette's voice was also in Uncommon Justice. I hope Terry Devane reads my review. Maybe he'll put Sister Bernadette to rest."
3,a biased account,"This book is well-written and includes many interesting nuggests of information. However, its main flaw is that it draws almost exclusively on Western sources, which the author acknowledges. This leads to the deemphasis of important acts of cruelty by the foreigners, such as the more than accurate provisioning of the Westerners at the Legation building while leaving the local Chinese converts who had taken refuge with them to starve unless they would work as coolie labor, as well as their unwillingness to share their medical facilities with the local Chinese. The actions of the Bishop at Peitang contrast favorably with those of the diplomats. The account also deemphasizes the mass looting, rape, and murder that followed the capture of Beijing by foreign powers."
2,"Anglo-Saxons, Dagos and some Chinamen","A rather underwhelming book. The Boxer rebellion and the European (incl. US& Japanese) response to it has many aspects which this book hardly mentions: the rivalry between the powers, their differing goals, public opion back home in the various countries involved ... Basicly this book treats all of this not at all or as rather unimportant . Important are the British on the spot, the Americans are highly regarded and the rest are dagos: ""Frog dagos, sauerkraut dagos, wodki dagos, macaroni dagos"". The treatment the author gives them shows that she seems to share this opinion quoted in the book."
2,Sadly flawed,"This book could have been so good. An overview of Israel by someone who does not parrot the pro-Israel line. Finally. Sadly, Mr. David has become so hostile to Israel that he sees evil everywhere and is unwilling to give any Israeli the benefit of the doubt. This book is overbalanced in its hostility.It is also very (surprisingly) weak on the 1945 to 1949 period that created Israel. By weak, I mean he just doesnt give enough pages to this vital period.That said, the book does offer some information that might lead interested readers to better, less biased sources."
5,An amazing book,"This is the best book I've read so far this year ... it should be required reading for all Israelis and Americans, who are consistently only given one side of the story. That's kind of what the book is all about ... what we're *not* being told. This book tells it loud and clear, and backs it up with impeccable references.I can't recommend it enough... it is needed now more than ever. I will read through it once more (it's a very quick read) and will then start lending it to all my friends."
1,Anti-Israel Propaganda,"My recommendation is that you skip this one. The authors present a wholly one-sided Israel-bashing view of the conflict which ignores most of the well documented history of the conflict.I suggest you google instead. The only reason it gets one star is that this propaganda leaflet masquerading as scholarship has some minor amusement value...did make me laugh. Also, one star is the lowest rating possible. Ultimately it would be a shame if anyone actually believed the content of this book although I'm confident that few objective readers will fall for it. If you must read it though, make sure you go to the Israeli Embassy website to read a more balanced viewpoint.Beware any document on the Arab-Israeli conflict which demonizes the opposing viewpoint. Also, beware of books recommended by those who *liked* this one! Whew."
2,Not the right item,"I ordered what I thought was a collectible set of CDs from the Greatest Pianists of the Twentieth Century Series, but it was not in a collectible case, so I have sent it back and asked for a refund. Have received a refund from the seller."
4,"Fun, but not always clear directions","This is a ""Clue"" type game, based on the classes, spells, and characters of Hogwarts, the Wizarding school of Harry Potter and his friends (and enemies).My kids love this game! I'm a little less impressed, simply because not all the directions are clear. A couple of things that we weren't sure about, we adjusted the rules to fit our own needs. It still worked out just fine. My 7 year old plays it as well, despite the game recommending ages 8 and up (I think).No Harry Potter knowledge is needed, but basing it on Harry Potter makes it a little more interesting. My youngest son enjoys sending people back to ""start"" with the ghost.We chose this game over the Trivia game, as only my oldest son and I have read the books as of right now. It seemed to satisfy my oldest son's want for a Harry Potter game, at least for the time being. <G>"
1,Not worth it!,"Honestly, $100 for this game is outrageous! If you like Harry Potter-themed games and enjoy playing Clue, just buy the Clue: Harry Potter game. It's much cheaper and the cards/game have better printed graphics. Don't bother with this knock-off!"
4,PRI 4-In-1 Soft Seat Toilet Trainer and Step Stool,"Very nice toilet trainer, with different parts that can be removed and cleaned. I didn't rate it with 5 stars because as a step stool it fails in that it doesn't have any anti-sliding underneath and when my sons use it, most of the time it slides too much."
3,Did I get a USED potty chair?,"This potty chair looks great, but I'm concerned it may have been used. It arrived with a sticker (3 ducks with balloons) applied to the front of potty chair base. None of the photos online or on the box show any stickers or decorations. Did I get a used potty? The manufacturer is closed for vacation, so if anyone can tell me if their potty chairs came like this too, please do. Please ignore my rating, as we have not tried the seat yet.Thanks."
2,Doesn't charge an i-pad,"Major disappointment. I thought it would work with all apple products. I don't have an i-phone yet, so haven't been able to see how it performs with that device. Too bad, because all of the apple products use the same connector, so I thought I would only need to bring along ONE tip for my i pod and I pad, and could leave the apple connector behind. I'm glad I tried it out at home first."
4,Sensual Rain,"Sweet, sensual, and erotic are thoughts that immediatly come to mind when discussing Marlon Green's ""Making Love in the Rain."" It is a collection of stories, poems, and essays. Some of them are erotic, some cute, and some very touching work. These are selections about lost love, heartbreak, adventure, and self-pleasure just to name a few.In reading this book the author makes you witness to sexual escapades that you could not have dream of: sex in public places, sex between multiple partners, and other erotic adventures. But to his credit Marlon Green also writes about the tenderness of making love, and the love that lovers can have for one another. He shows how beautiful sex can be between two people who have completely given themselves to one another.""Making Love in the Rain"" is a beautifully put together book; on the RAW scale I give it a 4.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks"
3,BE ADVISED!!!,"Despite the cover having the same ""ESSENTIAL"" banner along the left edge, this volume does not seem to follow the sequence of the other Essential volumes. Volume #2 covers issues #21-#43 (plus annuals #2 & #3); Volume #4 covers issues #69-#89 (plus Annuals #4 & #5). According to the cover scan of this one, it covers issues #44-#65 (plus Annual #4). Issues #66-#68 seem to be missing, and Annual #4 is in both this volume and in volume #4.There is another Essentials Volume #3 that is out of print and seems to be the one that goes with the essential set.Essential Spider-Man Vol. 3"
1,Massacred!!!!,"I was so excited to finally find a piece by Torroba ""Twelve Interludes"" for guitar and string quartet that I never heard before but have been looking for for a long time. Unfortunatly, the performers totally massacre this work. They have sloppy playing through out and the recording is dead acoustically. What a disapointment."
3,Raunchy reading,"This book read like a Harlequin but with a fancier cover. Bad girl meets rich guy next door and sparks fly even though both are suprised to be attracted to each other. Throw in a baby (who is allergic to disposable diapers--egads), a dead sugardaddy and his jealous daughter, a greedy blackmailer, and there's the story. There are some sideplots with an abused divorcee who finds love with a hunky younger man who doesn't know how to read, an extended family of siblings all fathered by different men, etc. The spice level on the saucy language needed to be turned down because it became distracting after awhile. Okay for a mindless beach read."
1,shallow and predictable,"Oh, my god! I was looking for a light read, but this was terrible. Made for easily excitable teens. Boring and predictable plot, and oh, so shallow!"
1,AWFUL AND BORING!!!!,I could not finish this book!!!! It is so boring and really doesn't make sense!! I have read most of London's books and I DON'T BELIEVE SHE WROTE THIS BOOK!!! HORRIBLE AND A WASTE OF MAY MONEY!!!!
5,Wonderful,"I have just read The Secret Lover by Julie London, and I think it is one of her best books ever. The story is real to life I could almost picture myself as Sophie. I have read alot of books and never before could I actually put myself in the women's place. The story was a very good one . The carator's were very good ones{believable}. But, The ending was the best one I have redin along time. It mad me cry and hope that Sophie and Caleb do meet each other by the pond in the after life.Just Wonderful!!!!! Keep up the good work Julia London."
3,Beware the Epilogue,"In truth this is an amazing piece of historical fiction. Being a 2 book a day reader, I've become jaded and it takes alot to get me to run home to read a book. This story had it, funny characters, great dialogue and a to die for hero. The book is by turns witty and charming and had the Eplogue NOT been included I would have added Julia London to my must buy list. But not now.. I literally threw the book across the room and as far as I am concerned I wasted 3 hours reading a book that in the long run left me feeling rather [upset]. So in fair warning don't read the Epilogue unless you DON'T like to think of ""Happily Ever After."""
1,Make in Taiwan. Poor Quality,"Unfortunately, this product is ""Made in Taiwan"", and is no better that the cheaper brands from major auto parts stores. Returned and purchased from Toyota."
3,"got what i paid for, not sure if it works yet.","I got what I paid for but I'm not sure if it works yet. This is one CD and at the beginning of the CD on track 1 it says you should not listen to this CD unless you have about 1/2 hour of alone time. It leads you to beleive you need to listen to a Disc 2 if you want to drive and listen at the same time. There is no Disc 2, instead you need to listen to track 6 while driving or anything like that. That should be stated on the review, which it's not. At first I thought I had to buy another CD in order to effectively use this."
2,Didn't work for me.,"After reading all the reviews and deciding back and forth whether I should buy or not, I finally bought it. Since most of the reviews were pretty positive. I have been studying a lot on the subconscious in these past years, so I do know that working with the subconscious can bring in positive changes. I do believe that this tape might genuinely work miracles for some people, but obviously one size does not fit all. I listened to it for 5 weeks straight, everyday, once for side one and maybe four times on average daily for side two. But nope my eating habits didn't really change for the better. Most of the stuffs stated on the tape were pretty positive, but a few statements I felt they could have done without or worded in a way that could have been a bit more positive."
4,Great disc!,"To lose weight, I tried coconut oil, the Master Cleanse, green tea, and other natural methods. I do believe all the methods I tried work for other people, however they did not work for me. This disc started working for me in the first week. I listen to it every night when I go to bed. I always fall asleep to it, which is fine. Sometimes I would listen to it twice daily. I believe it works. I found myself actually wanting and enjoying healthier foods, specifically vegetables and fruit. I attributed this to the disc. The price is good, the woman's voice on the disc pleasant. Give it a try!"
2,This book did absolutely nothing for me,"I enjoyed the previous two books (""Jack the Bodiless"" and ""The Diamond Mask""), they were above average science fiction books.With ""Magnificat"" however, I kept rolling my eyes at the blatant attempts by the author to use the novel as a platform for her religious and moral views. She just ended up making the characters look stupid. These people are ultra-intelligent, demi-god like characters, yet they ended up acting like a bunch of dumb, little kids, no intrigue, no slick plots, just ""the biggest brain wins"" period."
2,The only Tintin book which I wasn't crazy for...,"I have been reading and collecting Tintin books since...well, before I really could read! I have read all of them (including ""Tintin in the Congo"") and must say that this one is the only one which I truely didn't care for. Yes, it's a Tintin book which makes it still good for die hard fans. But if you haven't read any or many Tintin books and are looking to see which one to read next, I would suggest any of the others before this one."
4,Wow!,"I had never heard of Nelson Freire before hearing him play with Argerich in Carnegie Hall.Nelson Freire is a hidden treasure ... this disc should be in your collection. I also recomend ""Duo Piano Extraveganza,"" where he teams with Argerich."
4,Verilog testbench reference,"The book provides a good resource for those designers that already know Verilog and wish to have coding tips for simulation testbenches.It is learn-by-example format, and is updated to include the '99 verilog standard. The book is well laid out, meaning that from the index it is easy to find a relevant coding example.I also bought ""A designers guide to VHDL"" Peter J. Ashendon which is a language reference for VHDL by example."
2,eh,"doesnt look like the picture at all. it has a thicker membrane and much less balls than appeared. feels like theres too much air in it, balls have weird texture. not happy with it"
2,"Silly, repetitive book","The book shows us the history of American debdom from the colonial era to the present day. I thought it was going to be more interesting than it was. The more I read, the sillier the whole concept of being a debutante seemed. I also felt like the author copied the style of the reporters who used to report on debutante balls. She would breathlessly describe fabrics for paragraphs, or tell us that so and so had shown up at this ball. It was sort of like reading a trashy magazine you can buy at the supermarket."
4,"Pretty Cool, Lots of Insight","Drive Well, Sleep Carefully is visually interesting with great tunes and tons of live footage. For those who are looking for a ""live"" dvd with uncut performances, this dvd is not for you. The whole disc feels more like a documentary than a live and uncut sort of disc. That's not entirely a bad thing, because voice overs add to the overall artistic feel of the disc. It seems like some people have given this dvd a lot of negative feedback because the members of Deatcab come off as whiny occasionally;however, it seems that many reviews that give negative feedback do not take into consideration that being a ""rockstar"" is a difficult job. Frankly, Deathcab is rather honest in many parts of the film, and Drive Well, Sleep Carefully shows a dimension of touring that a lot of music fans do not see. Overall, this disc is worth adding to a disc collection for non-Deatcab and Deathcab fans alike."
3,delay!,I've never seen such delay in delivering a product. It's been over a month since I bought it until now not received it.
2,Buyer Beware,"The set looked quite nice when it arrived. The material was a little lighter weight than I had hoped for and the color slightly darker than it looked in the picture. The real problem was that the comforter, shams and bedskirt were all labeled ""dry clean only"" when the description had stated in several places that all items were machine washable for easy care. Since this was a gift for a household with children and pets, the set was promptly returned. A proper description would have saved me alot of time and trouble."
4,Good product--but shortage found,"At first I was very glad to find the Hefty Ultra Flex trash bags that I could not find in my local stores. I bought 3 cases with 6 boxes in each case. Later, I discovered one box had only 5 bags in it instead of the 16 it was supposed to have. The box doesn't look like it was tampered with so I suspect there was a problem when the boxes were packed. I would like to have a new box to compensate for this shortage. Otherwise, this is a very convenient way to shop."
5,Reader.,"When I bought my Mastiff I really hadn't a clue about anything health wise. All I knew was that their disposition was wonderful. I purchased this book along with two other more expensive books and spent more time reading this one than the other two. This is a very well written and in depth book. The author obviously did research and/or knew about the breed. The book is my refrence guide whenever I have a question that I need answered. I would definately say that you will be getting more than you pay for if you buy this book! It tells you everything from the history, to selecting a puppy, nutrition, diseases, training, breeding, all the way to the end of a life for one. It has some beautiful pictures to show you what a Mastiff looks like from the beginning till the heartbreaking end. I fully recommend this book above any that I have read so far!"
4,Good First book on raising English Mastiffs,I found this book as a very good starting point for my family after we bought our puppy. It has plenty of great info to help you raise your dog.
3,Pretty good,This is an okay Mastiff book. It didn't seem to have as much relevant information as other Mastiff books....
2,talks too fast,I have to agree with those who say that Tara speaks way way too fast on this video.She talks so fast that sometimes she's slurring her own speech. I found it very hardto follow.
4,"Great, But One Major Problem...","I love Tara, and I love all these DVDs; however, on DVD 3 (AM/PM YOGA FOR EVERYONE), the DAILY BASIC FLOW says it is 15 minutes, and it's actually 30 minutes. This is a major disappointment, and I will have to deduct a star, as I was really looking forward to having a daily 15-minute routine. Other than that, the routines are awesome, and you really do get your $$$ worth!"
4,sensory overload,Antoni overwhelmed the senses with many intimacies of island life and of women's beautiful and exclusive suffering. The fact that some parts of this novel were written by a white person or by a man was hard to believe. Reading this novel was like dreaming about a past life.
4,finding an old song,"I have been looking , off and on, for this album for 40 yrs. and had no idea it could still be found. I started with a Google search, which led me to Amazon. At Amazon I find it's available as a CD- in England. A week later it's at my door."
2,If you remember NIxon...,"If you are old enough to remember Spiro Agnew and have had ""smoke all up inside your head"", give this one a listen. Jaime's comedic timing is impeccable. I gave it about a 72..."
2,"Short and Simple, yet Shallow","Stacy Combs Lynch has given a beginners book on Classic Music, however I am not sure what age group the beginners have to be. Although there is some interesting information here, it seems as though something is missing in this book. Perhaps its not focused enough, for the idea of Classical Music alone can be very broad. She carts down the famous composers dedicating a page or two to each of them pertaining to different eras and different classical styles. Once in a while there is be an interuption in what a particular style or instrument does. Overall the book is brief and could have been better with more information. A better book is ""Classical Music (Teach Yourself""."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this for my grandaughter; however, the meal time set looks totally different - no bag, no jar or bottle warmerI will return this set"
1,Broke after a few laps around the track,The only thing my son asked for was the Polar Express. Santa delivered excietment at first and then the Polar Express delivered tears. The train ran a few laps around the track and then quit working all together. When I flipped the engine upside down I saw one of the Center Rollers had busted off. Last year we replaced our Thomas the Train that was Lionel 2 times before getting one that works. This year we can't even replace it because Amazon is out of stock. Totally bumbed I have to go through this again.
3,Good and bad,"Brought this to go around the tree for Christmas. Train itself is beautiful, heavy and detailed, at high speeds it puts out a great amount of smoke, but be warned at lower (quieter) speeds it puts out none. The set is very very loud, you can not run this at a speed needed to generate smoke and have a conversation in the vicinity. Nor can you hear the whistle over the sound of the train on the tracks, this feature is a complete waste of time. Also at low speeds <50% the lights in the cars a hardly visible. In short the locamotive is what you are paying for the rest is poor at best. Gets 3 stars just for the engine, nothing more"
1,Lionel Train - a big DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"The Engine is nicely made out of die cast metal. The passenger trains are light weight plastic. The value of the item is the engine/track/control. The rest of the prodcut is worth $5-10 combined - so the overall value of the item is questionable. The train will not operate or pull all of the passenger cars - as it appears to be too much weight. The Engine sometimes works and sometimes doesn't and I found if I unplugged/plugged it back in, it may resume working. The Engine has to be placed on the track just so - it is somewhat difficult and frustrating to get it in the ""right"" position. The engine's horn never worked and the smoke only worked the first day or so - it too was sporadic. Very disappointed."
2,Breaks easily,"The train looks nice, but the quality is iffy. My first stopped working after a week. Amazon was good enough to exchange it. The lights on the second blew out in a day. I just got our third, so we will see. I am not hopeful. If this weren't a beloved gift from Santa, I would just return it and get something else. I expected better quality from Lionel."
3,Help - motor whines,"I just recieved this last week and my son put it together this morning. The motor whines and it is slow to take off, sometimes needing a push. Is this something with a quick fix that I can do or do I need to return it?? Any help would be greatly appreciated."
3,Noisy!!!,"All the positive comments about this train are all true: nice looking, sturdy build... However, nobody mentioned anything about the noise. The resonated noise of the wheels on the tracks is very loud and almost unbearable."
1,Terrible track,"With the slightest touch, the track falls out of place. Spend the extra money, and purchase the ""O"" gauge train set by Lionel. It is a much better product, and your kids will have enjoy it much more than its plastic ""G"" gauge"" counterpart."
4,Good but not great,"Overall, this was a pretty good train set. My 6yo son loves it, although he's never been exposed to anything but wooden Thomas the Train sets. Several of the components in the set are very fragile and can break easily (plastic whistle on top of the locomotive, observation deck on the observation car). Smoke output is marginal, but works. I had a problem with the tender car on arrival. One of the axles was badly bent and the car would not stay aligned with the track. I contacted the vendor and they sent a replacement out immediately. There were also a number of minor paint scuffs on the locomotive, which I had to touch-up with a sharpie. Don't know if the set I received was a customer return, but I would not expect these types of issues with a brand-new set. Maybe these are simply indications of Lionel's quality inspection process. Although the vendor, Legacy Station, resolved my issue with the tender in a timely manor, I probably won't order from them again."
1,What Does TOSHIBA mean in Japanese? HORRIBLE!!!,"Bought this HDTV in September 2006 for about $1500.00. After about 18 months it slowly developed a red distortion along the bottom of the screen. At almost exactly 2 years, the thing made a poping noise one morning and no picture. Luckily (I guess)I purchased a three-year extended warranty from Mack. In short, it took about 8 weeks to have them pick it up and return it. It has been working OK up until last week, the 3 year anniversary, and the same d**m thing happened. Currently summiting a new claim with Mack (UGH!!!), so we will see what happens. I will definately buying Panasonic next time!"
1,This TV can be a disaster,"Be wary of the one year warrantee. My set failed at 13 months and Toshiba (so far) would not help. There are hot spots and color distortion in the clouds and basically any white areas on either regular TV, DVD or video games.The tech support was worthless to the point of being annoying. I've done a web search and I'm not alone. However, as of yet there are no recalls."
3,Reclaiming the Blade - good but not great,"Kinda cool, kinda interesting, kinda disappointing, but with some very cool moments, Reclaiming the Blade is a mixed bag. I don't regret buying it but it's not a favourite. being a historical re-enactor for fun, just getting into historical manual combat, the highlights were some very cool snippets of show combat, and manual combat, by various groups. If you sift through the fluff there are some good moments, and it's not rubbish by any means, but it's the frustrating sort of project where someone has a great idea, but doesn't do the sort of in-depth job you wished they could have done."
5,Good History of Sword,The video provides a great overview of the history of swords juxtaposed with modern sword cinematic choreography. Made extra unique by the numerous interviews with sword choreographers and historians.
5,Brilliant short (long!) stories,"Robert Charles Wilson has long been one of my favourite authors both in long fiction and short. As a Canadian, I've been able to see his wonderful short fiction as it appeared in various Canadian venues, such as the _Northern Frights_ and the _Tesseracts_ series of anthologies. Now they are collected here and they are fabulous. Wilson writes with heart and soul and a staggering intellect that is never show-offy. His fiction is a joy to read. My favorite of the stories is the title one, ""The Perseids,"" which quite rightly won Canada's top sci-fi prize, the Aurora. For readers who know Wilson's work, his short fiction is much more in the vein of his Hugo nominated _Darwinia_ rather than in that of the more recent _Bios_. I recommend this book highly and hope it is only the first of many collections from RCW."
2,Dull,The book read like a bad high school text book. I didn't enjoy it nor did my son who is a fan of trains.
5,Mostly in Welsh,"Found this by chance. Gibson has a lovely voice. It is like a recital - a number of gentle songs, beautifully sung. When it is in Welsh the voice is just like a fine instrument itself and the meaning doesn't matter."
4,"ABBA's ""Voulez Vous""","This is certainly a good ABBA album. However, new fans should not start here. Their 'Gold Greatest Hits' album is more winning. This album does contain some of ABBA's tracks, as follows:""Voulez Vous"" ""Angeleyes"" ""Chiquitita"" ""If It Wasn't For the Nights""But it also has ""Kisses of Fire"" and ""Lovers Live a Little Longer"" which are both sort of flimsy and outdated. The rest of this fine album is better. However, get the essential 'Gold' CD and you will not be dissapointed. But this one's still a winner."
2,Forschner lover - completely unimpressed,"I have a number of Victorinox Forschner knives, and until now have never been disappointed. These knives are not made in Switzerland, but rather in Portugal for Victorinox.They don't share the same polished finish that the kitchen knives have.The black Forschner stamping is uneven in appearance, and simply doesn't look as professional as on their kitchen knives. I'm sure the markings will come off with use quickly. Knives also arrived with sticky goo on some of the handles."
3,Photoshop 6 Artistry,"Photoshop 6 Artistry contains very detailed and descriptive information on Photoshop 6 which is not found in the Photoshop 6 manual. It gives the reader the ability to become proficient in the use of most every aspect of Photoshop. While this book contains lots of useful and very detailed information, it is very hard to follow because it is written in a conversational style. Because of this it contains information which can be confusing. It addresses many topics which are not directly related to the main subject. It also contains circular references. For example many paragraphs or sections make reference to other chapters, web sites, and apparently pertinent information to be found elsewhere. It also has not been tightly edited as evidenced by numerous typographical errors. This also makes it hard to read."
2,Little useful advice here,"I read about this book and was eager to read it to help me in problems with my elderly parent. The book as a complete disappointment; there was little practical advice, not well written. I gave to Goodwill, not wanting to pass on to a library or any friend."
5,Elder Rage,"Since I am the main caregiver for my elderly mother (85) and I live in a small town Jaqueline's book has encouraged me to get the proper medical help, ask the right questions and insist on definate answers from medical staff. I was thrilled to even recieve personal e-mail from the author and no longer feel so alone in my endeavers to keep sane during a very trying time in my life."
2,of no practical value,"I found no help from this book due to a couple of things, while emotionally it was interesting to read of another persons journey through this terrible disease, the author apparently was financially able to hire and keep considerable extra help which most families find impossible. Because this is a disease that begins gently yet if patient reports mild symptoms to medical staff, this record is enough to eliminate them from obtaining long term care insurance and most average families cannot afford the $7000 per month fee for long term care which could last many years. Also, I found the writing style very annoying, irritating and useless in terms of offering support or help. The constant reference to media titles only filled space which quickly caused me to skip some of the text. I would not recommend this book."
5,MY ANGEL,"Being the only sibling and taking care of my 84 year old mother, I found this book to be my salvation. I received thru this book ways to which I should handle Mom, ways to help her help herself and helpful hints, like using velcrove on devices so she can shut things off and on,to emergency braclets, in case she decides to go walking and forgets where she lives, to medication, which I knew nothing about. I also received times of humor, which I dearly needed and felt like I was sharing the same experiences. I am on my second time around with this book and have told many of my friends about it. I hope to meet Jacqueline personally someday to thank her."
4,Great !!!,"I enjoyed the Music,but I didn't like the silly antics and costumes.I may have ordered this Video before and failed to watch it and then lost it in moving from one apartment to another.It's similar to Encore:For future generations so I'm happy I purchased it. I gave it 4 Stars because of the silliness or stupid stuff."
4,Great companion to the first book,"If you've ever eaten at the Union Square Cafe and loved it, you'll be happy to know that there is now a 2nd book of recipes from that famed eatery. I had the first, and was very pleased to find some of my favorites in there. The second is also terrific, and a great companion to the first."
2,Not a Great Second Act,"i LOVED the first Union Square Cookbook, and use its recipes regularly...and i have been SO disappointed with this one...i have not made ANYTHING that i liked from this cookbook...spare yourself"
4,What is This?,"Is this CD jazz, rock, sound effects, or experimental music? No, its Bobby Previte, a jazz drummer who created several inconsistent CD's through the years, with the high lights being ""Claude's Late Morning"" & ""Empty Suits"". The CD Starts out with ""Look Both Ways"" an almost Oriental Pat Metheny like jazz-rock combo with great percussion to the haunting multi layered ""One Bowl"" to the almost comical ""Sometimes You Need An Airport"", this is a great CD for any modern jazz or percussion lover. If you like this CD, try ""Empty Suits"" which is more universal & mysterious. Be careful with CD's like ""Music of the Moscow Circus"" & ""Hue & Cry"", they are not up to par, lacking the intensity of ""Claude's Late Morning"" & ""Empty Suits""."
4,Good Flour,"I'm baking whole wheat bread, using a recipe from Cook's Illustrated Pastry Recipes. I use a bread machine to make dough, and then bake it in the oven.They suggested using Graham Flour. I tried it, and found it OK. Now I use King Arthur's flour, and get great bread. I use a bit more water, and bake it at 350 deg instead of 375 deg. The bread is moister and delicious. You can buy graham flour if you wish, but King Arthur's Whole Wheat is excellent."
4,Works great on porcelain tile,"Drilled 20 holes (using drill fluid) through porcelain, concrete, and wire mesh to install grab bars. It's getting a little worn but will work on softer materials. Ordering another to install more bars in the shower."
4,Great savings.,"Purchased two boxes from Amazon at the normal price of one box,(compared to my regular store locally), freight included. Great savings for a good product."
1,Misleading at Best,This book purports to take you on a journey into the heart of Islam for the purpose of helping an outsider understand the world of the Muslim. This book in fact is just a manual on how to convert Muslims into Christians. I found this book misleading due to the fact that there is no mention of converting Muslims anywhere in the title or on the back cover.
5,Fantastic sandals,These sandals were a wonder find. Just what I expected. Very comfortable. Should have bought 1 in each color.
3,"promising, but confusing","I'm a 40 year old Ivy League graduate and I thought the directions were hopeless confusing. Once we sat down and played the game, things became a little clearer. Still I never really was sure when you could or should play the special cards, or when you were allowed to replenish your hands. We ended up making up our own rules to make up for the inadequate rules provided. It comes in a terrible box, I'm sure we'll lose the cards all too soon. Still my 8 year old ended up creaming me so he thinks it's a great game."
3,MY opinion,"I thought the whole darn thing was horrible. I have recieved this game for Christmas years ago, and I still hven't understand the rule. They should clarify the instruction. At least the deck is really cool to look at."
5,very good fun,"this game is really fun, once you get the hang of it... the instructions were vague, but we found our way around it. when i play with my friends we get very competetive. the one thing i don't like is the packaging. it's very hard to store. but i still recommend it to any harry potter fan, or anyone who likes card games or games in general..."
2,"The Quidditch game COULD be fun, with better rules.","Like I said, if there were better written rules for this game, it would be a blast! But the rules are very poorly written. While playing it, my mom and I didn't know how a round ended, what to do if you ran out of cards, etc. We were thinking that if we really wanted to play this game, we would have to add in our own rules! This game was somewhat fun since I love Harry Potter, but when it go so frustrating and confusing not know how to play, the fun was taken out of it."
4,Fun Game,"I really enjoy the Harry Potter quidditch game. Although at first it takes a while to understand. and you are forced to constantly check the instructions, once you figure it out the game is a lot of fun. I am 14 and I play this with my 8 year old sister, so it is good for all ages. The point of the game is to use Player cards, such as keeper, chaser, or bludger to either win the quaffle or win the bludger. The player with the higher card wins, and there are various spells and jinxs which can be used to win balls. The cards are quite sturdy, and have very detailed pictures on them. I reccommend this game to all Harry Potter fans."
2,Harry Potter Quidditch Card Game,"The Harry Potter Card Game is based on Quidditch, a game played on broom sticks in the Harry Potter books. The game fairly represents the way Quidditch is playedHowever, the Harry Potter card game is repetitive and boring. You play only on Quaffles, Bludgers, and the all-important golden snitch. Unless you put the point value of the snitch down to five times that of a Quaffle, it is pointless, because whoever gets the snitch will win more than 95 percent of the time. Even if you do that, it still is more boring than reading about it in Harry Potter.As for education, there is very little strategy to it and no learning tools I can see. Durability, because they are cards and are bound to get bent. The flimsey box doesn't help its case.Harry Potter fans, there are much better things to get to hold you over until the fifth book. I don't reccommend this product."
3,Why make War so complicated?,"Sure, the card game of War is all luck of the draw, but adding these complex rules just makes it silly. While I enjoyed seeing a little bit of Quidditch in real life (in case you didn't know, it's he fictional game created by author/literary mastermind J.K. Rowling), I don't think it's really worth the work."
5,Works great for a 4 cyl car,"I used it to collect excess brake fluid during a brake line & fluid swap and an engine oil change. Worked fine for my 4 cyl turbo car. You might wanna get a bigger one if you have a car that takes more than 5 quarts. Moving the pan under the car, the fluid started oscillating and it would've definitely overflown if there was more in it IMO."
4,good disc,"This band is really good. I just got the Cd at a show October Baby played in Bensalem, Pa. The show was amazing. I swear, it was the most energetic pop/rock band I've seen in a while. But their newer material is a lot different from this disc. I like this disc alot since it has the metal edge, but I really can't wait to hear newer stuff since their live show of new songs was really good. Great job guys."
4,A roller-coaster comet ride!,"The strength of this novel is the unique premise of building a colony on a moving comet and it's scientifically plausible solutions to the scary dangers they encounter. It's definetely hard sci-fi, that is filled with techy stuff, but very well done and well thought out.However the weakness of the book for me was the characterization and the cliched plot device of superhumans(percells) vs normal people (orthos). This idea has been done to death in sci-fi and even in comics, ie. Marvel comics X-men (mutants vs humans). Also I didn't care too much for the characters themselves. Characters seemed a bit flat, and without depth (not enough character motivation to explain actions).But despite this, I liked the book for it's inventive solutions and epic timeline. It has a great ending also. Out of ten, I'd give it a solid 8."
1,Locks closed,"I have a regular grabber tool, but I wanted the folding option of this grabber tool. It is unfortunate that it locks with the suction cups closed with either position of the switch on the handle, so it is useless. Don't waste your money."
3,Did this really win the Pulitzer Prize?,"This book was clearly written for those who believe that the ordinary is extraordinary. True, simplicity can be beautiful and illuminating, but banality is just boring. While the characters are amusing, the plot lacks direction and focus. On a good note, the prose is smooth and highly readable."
2,needs plot lessons,"Each chapter was the same. Yes, there are some bursts of good writing, but without a good plot... it was wasted."
5,One of my favorite books,"This entire novel takes place in just one day (with a lot of flashbacks). I won't go into the whole story here because you can get that elsewhere, but let me just say that the characters are well-developed and the structure (one day in the life of) works really well here. It is poignant and funny at the same time."
3,A minor work by a great writer,"Anne Tyler is one of my favourite writers, but of the twelve of her books I have read, this is one of my least favourite. As ever the writing is of a high quality and there is the usual assortment of quirky characters and gentle humour, but this book never really took off for me. Maggie is just a bit too annoying and unbelievable. As a child she liberates a pet hamster only for it to be eaten by the cat. Maggie appears to have spent the next forty years doing similar things, yet never learning. Tyler's best characters, however eccentric, develop during the novel. Maggie does not. I thought the best section of the book was the short second part which is seen through her husband's eyes. Maggie, for all the faults he observes in her, is a more sympathetic and likeable person when seen through Ira's eyes rather than through her own."
1,Disappointing,"What a disappointing book especially after reading The Accidental Tourist, which I liked. I admired the character Ira for his love and loyalty to Maggie, but both are losers who let life just happen to them. Ira is a depressed man and Maggie needs to get a life. She was so annoying and I was so disappointed by the end. The details just went on and on and I kept hoping it would get better. In the end, I felt so sorry for Fiona and Leroy. Maggie is cruel and selfish. I was appalled that she continued preparing dinner when Fiona just found out that not only Jesse didn't give a hoot about her soap box, he was seeing someone else, all going on in front of her granddaughter."
2,"maggie, the main character, is really annoying.","The further I got into the novel, the more I disliked Maggie. She's the personification of the phrase ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"". She's a nosy busybody, and I can't help feeling that her family would have gotten along much better if it weren't for her simplemindedness. The only redeeming trait Maggie has (if you can call it redeeming) is that she plugs on with her life no matter what happens. The book is readable, but you can find much better novels by the author."
4,BETTER THAN PLAYDOUGH,"My kids have been begging for Floam and MoonSand. They received Floam for Christmas, when I opened it and they saw how it stuck to my hands, they wouldn't even touch it--it went straight to the trash. I decided to try MoonSand and bought one set to try it. They had hours of fun. I actually like it better than playdough. It doesn't smell, and just like playdough, whatever drops out we just brush up with our hands and add it back in. Anything else just vacuums or sweeps up. I'll definately be buying additional sets."
2,"A lot of info, but that's it.","I have a few problems with this book.1) He says lifting weights is bad. Not true.2) A lot of the nutrition info is out of date.3) There is no real program, only a Charles Atlas thumbnail sketch of a program.4) I don't really like his warm ups.5) No stretches or cardio (except, maybe, Furey squats).6) No progressive arrangement of exercises(easy to hard). Just variations of the same exercises.7) You have to already be in shape to do alot of the exercises.8) Some of the exercises strike me as down-right dangerous (Neck bridge).The only good thing I can say about this book is that it does caontain a lot of bodyweight exercises.The book should be called, I wish I were Charles Atlas but I'm not."
2,"Nothng new, but good compilation of exercises","This book combines exercises of Furey, Tsatsouline, Atlas and others but doesn't add anything. I bought these books previously but struggled to combine them into a system that allowed progression from beginner to advanced. This book's ""transformetrics system"" claims to do this but misses completely.The progresson recommended is to add a chapter per week, but as the chapters are dedicated to a body part, its a poor way to progress.If you are looking for a system, I suggest:- Craig Balantyne's Turbulence Training 6 month bodyweight manual- Alwyn Cosgrove's Program Design Manual + his bodyweight DVDI give the book 2 stars because the exercises are excellent and its much cheaper than buying the books separately. I recommend it for someone who wants to tryout bodyweight exercies and is already in shape (as there are few beginners exercises)."
2,Pictures are the only good thing in the book,"Nutritional info is completely wrong and based on non scientific sources. The author has put too much of his own philosophy into the book instead of just making a purely workout reference tool.The exercises are good, but practically all of them have been developed by other people, which the author doesn't negate, although he does put a TM sign on his Transformetrics TM training system.Some of the exercises could be lethal if performed unprepared and I think that the reader isn't warned enough.The pictures are quite good, and the explanation of the exercises also."
5,beautiful and inspiring,"This is one of the loveliest children's books I've ever read -- not only because the photographs are so stunning -- gorgeously reproduced, and in turns beautiful, humorous, charming, or downright cute -- but also because it shows children working together to take care of the natural world. Really, really wonderful -- don't miss it."
4,Crossover Appeal,"Sara Groves is an outstanding singer-songwriter with the potential to appear not only on CCM charts, but on country, pop, and blues charts, as well. ""All Right Here"" is an ideal vehicle to showcase that crossover potential. It's all right here -- honest Christian lyrics, gentle love songs about husbands and children, and some county-blues complete with excellent dobro-esque backup. That's the good news and the bad news. Those looking for excellent music regardless of genre will delight in this CD. Those looking for more overtly Christian music, as in ""Converstations"", however, may well be a bit disappointed. Frankly, I am in the latter category; hence, the 4-star rating, though even now I'm having second thoughts -- she is just so good!"
5,AWESOME GAME!!,"A great party game with friends and family! This game is pretty close to watching it on TV. I read the other reviews and was a little hesitant in buying it but when I played it at home, I thought it was really cool! After all, there's no way ANY game will be just like the game show on-air...that's one of the advantages of watching it on TV!Get a life, people!!!"
2,Thought I was getting the VIdeo,THe game is confusing and I havent been able to force myself to play a complete game. THe Video version would have been much better
2,I've heard it all before,"If you have read the more popular books about Diana, or watched any news coverage of her throughout her life, you have already read this book. There are many quotes from Andrew Morton's ""Diana: Her True Story"" as well as Diana's infamous Panorama interview. Most of the other quotes seem to be taken out of random small talk conversations and provide little insight."
4,The love of my 5 year old,"My daughter fell in love with the costume as soon as she saw it. The moment we opened the package she was disappointed when she saw no hat. It is hard to find a pink and white hat for her to wear. This costume had to sent separately from another costume I bought, incurring higher shipping costs. I saw no reason for it to be shipped separately. It was in bigger packaging than my other costume but from the same place and on the same day. The bigger box was also not needed."
3,Toyota Pickup manual,"This is just ok manual book for my pickup.Only general large items such as engine, transmission are there.But, the little item such as door detail or lighting circuit detail were not there.Overall it's not too bad general manual, not the detailed service manual.Isaac"
5,Valuable book for the E-commerce cert,"This is a valuable book for studying for the CIW E-Commerce certification. I passed the test on my first attempt. This book is interesting, educational, and concise. There are plenty of quizes and review exercises. It is very well-organized as well. Included topics are marketing, web design, IIS, web portals, security, and catalogs. The CD has a great practice test as well. The Bible series has always offered solid, professional publications."
3,I've got a strangle-hold on you baby!,"Man, these things are tight... They will certainly not slip off during the most demanding merciless pounding you can provide with your pile-driver. Keep 'em well lubricated and hammer away. They should work well for your back-door excursions!"
5,not to bad,it fit my thing well and this is the 3rd time I bought it. the quality is good. My girl like it too.
5,"A great book, far ahead of its time","I'm not sure whether the other reviewers were reading the same book!The 27th City is both funny, enjoyable to read, and also prescient -- Franzen essentially provides a look at ""outsourcing"" long before that became a hot topic, except that what's being outsourced to India is the police, corruption, and local politics!Sound confusing and unfamiliar? Sure. But what really good literature doesn't defamiliarize our surroundings? Read the first chapter and you will be hooked. Frazen's premise is tremendously original. This is basically a more readable version of DeLillo's use of surreal plots to comment on very real problems, with a lot of dark humor thrown in to sweeten the p(l)ot."
1,A dud,"I came to this book with high expectations - the author has a high reputation and his latest book is being touted as ""The Great American Novel"". Despite a mild sense of boredom, a plot that did not really grab me, a complexity that makes great demands of the reader (almost every page has a new character and you don't know which ones are going to be important) and a somewhat turgid style I stuck with this for over a hundred pages before giving it up and writing it of as a waste of time."
3,Too many characters to follow.,"I loved Franzen's ""Strong Motion"" and ""The Corrections"", so was interested in reading this earlier work. I didn't get far. There were WAY TOO MANY characters to follow, many introduced in the first few chapters. I was so overwhelmed in trying to remember them all that I wrote them all down, with notations for each. After a few chapters it just got to be too much work trying to keep track. My time is too valuable, so I gave this book up. Maybe I'll read it some time in the future when I'm older and more patient, but at this point it doesn't seem worth the effort. Sorry Jonathon Franzen, because I loved your other books."
5,Great LCD display!,"Since my upgrade, I love to watch movies on this 19"" LCD display. Another great buy!"
1,Don't buy if you want to use more than a few months,"This monitor ran well for a few months and just went blank, I'm told it's not worth refurbing from a professional."
2,NICHT GUT,These are not airtight. They received a low rating from America's Test Kitchen but I did not see that episode until after I had received these bags. They cannot protect food in the freezer because the fancy zipper fails to seal the bag. Go with the Glad freezer bags.
4,good product,"I have 4 diamond hex audios and 2 blaupunkts all 6"" and 2 1.5"" diamonds hooked to this one, and at full blast the amp gets hot but it sounds fantastic."
1,low res LCD screen dies after 1 year,"My wife bought this item from SAMS --not Amazon. This review is not a reflection of Amazon or SAMS---this Polaroid product worked well for about 1 year---you get what you pay for... the LCD was a very low quality resolution, then died after one year. Now we have a high priced CD player and AM/FM radio in our kitchen. :)"
4,Pretty Good,"I was looking for a Life Application Bible when I found this New Living Translation. Honestly, the first thing that caught my eye was the color. The price wasn't too bad, so I decided to pick it up. If I didn't like it, I could give it away.I agree with other reviews that it is easy to read. I also felt that in some of the passages that I was comparing in Genesis, the text is a bit compromised. However, if you or someone you know has difficulty understanding other versions of the Bible, this is a great Bible to get.I also found that it is really useful when doing a Bible study to present a variety of versions."
3,Very narrow,This is a great shoe but it's very narrow. I had to return mine because my foot has apparently widened and the shoe sqeezes my foot.
3,Thor was one of marvels good ideas,"Although not as good as the Xmen, or Spiderman, Thor is pretty good compared to most of the other comic lines at that time. The villains are decent and the artwork is alright. Stories get a bit repetitive, as there are very few storylines that go beyond one comic. Still a decent read."
5,multi-hit CD,"this is the one you hope you'll get when you buy a new artist's cd. like a book you can't put down, song after song keeps hitting home. ballads,working-man blues, country funk.great song writting and production, really well put together on all levels."
2,BORING......,While she seems to be a likeable person she is immensely boring. I was a novice when I purchased her tape but have since tried many others and find that while she does get in all the right moves her choreography leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't really flow as well as some of the other tapes.
2,Repacks!,"This set is just repacks. The Stass Allie is the exact same mold as the Adi Gallia in scene 3, but painted darker. Agen Kolar is just a repack of the Eeth Koth figure released in the Power of the Jedi Line and is in a weird action pose. Shaak Ti is okay, but not great. All 3 characters have new figures in the Revenge of the Sith line. In you don't need to complete the council, skip this set and get those"
3,Stopping for a Spell,"This was a cute book for young kids - in the tradition of Dianna Wynne Jones. It was light-hearted and funny, and I enjoyed it as much as the kids I was babysitting did! Strongly recomended!"
2,Vegas 6 revealed,"To me, this book has a very disjointed teaching style that I found hard to understand/work with - and I have a Ph.D. in engineering! Can't recommend it - probably better to look at books/teaching CDs/DVDs by Douglas Spotted Eagle (the undisputed master of Vegas!)"
1,What a mess!,The commercials make Moon Sand look like it stays together well and is not messy at all. It is basically like letting your kid play with sand inside. It does mold together if you squeeze it or put it in a mold but that does not keep it from making a huge mess. If I could get rid of it without my child getting upset I would.
1,Cheaply priced and cheaply made,I bought this boom box for the price but I did expect what features it has to work ok. Well I am very disappointed to say the least. The minute I got it I hooked it up and it just sounds terrible. I put in a brandnew cd and turned the volume up about 1/2 way and the volume cuts in and out. On the tape mode it doesnt do it. I would also like to point out that the FM stereo reception is terrible. I pulled in more stations on my cheap walkman. In the future I will go with a brand I know and stay away from the real cheap stuff. I just hope I can help atleast one other person in the buying decision of this thing. It looks and the description sounds great but it's a headache in a box.
3,star wars figure rewiew man,It sucked. it was cool until the figures broke.They shoud have come with lightsabers.Adi Gallia was in the same mold as Stass Allie. the Sasee Tiin figure was execatly the same as the ep.II figure.and they shound of made Anikin they could of used Aayla Secura or Kit Fisto.so iam saying dont buy these figures.
4,Easy to set up and install; works as promised,"I already had one of these mounted on my garage, about 40 ft. from my back porch. If occurred to me that it would be great to have a second unit mounted inside the kitchen door so that the door could be opened and/or closed out of the weather and before I load my arm's with parcels ... etc. It is great. It took only a few minutes to set up and install this second units, and only a few more minutes to mount it on the wall next to my backdoor. With the cold and rainy season upon us, everybody in my household is pretty pleased with this additional convenience."
5,"Fast shipment, lowest price",Price was half of what was listed at Liftmaster website. Fast shipment. Works great and was easy to install and program.
5,Great Product,Easy to install. Works fine. What else is there to say. (Too bad it doesn't come in different colors.)
5,A Great Accessory,Just what you need for a Liftmaster Garage Door Opener. Easy to program. The convenience of a remote keypad is undeniable.
4,Liftmaster,"I have not had it very long, but so far I like it and would recommend it to others if asked."
1,disapointed,"the garage door keypad did not work for my door ,before I made my order I looked for compatibility but none was posted so I orderd it thinking it will work for most opener, but it did not work so I had to return it and lost $13. between postage and restocking fee which I am not happy about."
5,Good product,I like this product. The only thing that would make it better is if it came in different colors.
5,this should be released on dvd,i have this concert on vhs and i love it. now i'm buying dvd's and i would love it if they put this concert on dvd. it is my favorite concert that barbra did and i think it should be on dvd.
1,not able to view this- can we return it???,"I saw this years ago- and decided I wanted to add this to our collection.Sadly, we were never able to view it- as it would not come up on our DVD recorder. What to do???I need help! Shall I return for credit??"
5,excellent find,"Eventhough I don't have much equipment as someone new to the hobby, I find this is an excellent bag for taking gear on the go...it is my primary bag right now. Fits my Canon XSi with zoom attached (70-250) as well as the 18-55mm that came with the camera. With that, there is still room to add a flash and carry battery charger, filters, etc.Fast and easy to access my camera, sturdy and many features. Lowepro has a number of these in different sizes. I would probably be inclined to only look at Lowepro products in the future, when I need to expand."
1,Top handle tears,"The loop at the top of the pack tore while I was bringing my gear from the car to the house. Fortunately, true disaster was avoided when the camera bag with my camera landed on the car seat. This performance is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE for a backpack.I hope the vendors performance is better when I attempt to return the product."
4,Lowepro SlingShot 100,"Works great, but it is small the 200 or 300 maybe better if you have much stuff. I carried a D200 w/18-135mm DX mounted on it and a SB-800 flash, spare batteries for both and the charger for the D-200 battery and it was tight."
3,Not the best unit from a user perspective,The bag quality wise is fine but honestly for my Sony Alpha with two lenses it was a pain. First the 300 zoom lens does not fit with the glare cap on so you have to re-assemble it when you pull it out beyond changing the lens so fast access is not possible. I took this bag on a trip to Alaska and found it to be just too small. Quality wise the bag is fine and there were no issues there. I just found it to be not for my SLR what it sounded like when I bought it from the description. I have since given it another Family member who has a different sony camera without the the 300 lens attachment and they are very pleased with it. I have bought a full size bag for me and happy with that as well.
4,pleased,"Being an amature photographer and little experince in the field i don't have much to compare with. I found the bag to fit my camera needs, Olympic e-500 with extra lens and other accesaries to fit very nicely Will be traveling this week and should have better review at completion."
3,"Good for light travelling, depending on your camera","A comfortable bag, sits well on your back, and with the waist-buckle feature will stay in place when riding your bike!Holds just the right amount of equipment for those short trips, the camera and lens, perhaps an extra lens, along with batteries and memory cards smartly and conveniently placed. I love the way it twists around to your front for quick access! Just leave your lens on your camera and it's ready to pull out and shoot!The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because this, and even the 200AW which is bigger, were too small for my camera (Canon 300D) with the battery grip on (BG-E1), and although I could store my camera and a few items in the bag, I was unable to utilize the quick access feature (which is why I got it in the first place).Perfect for a smaller SLR or one without the battery grip!"
2,Description deceiving,"This bag seems to be overall well designed. However it is too small and the description is deceiving. It will not fit my Canon 5D with 28-70 zoom. Where exactly should I fit the ""SLR with mid-range zoom lens attached, up to two extra lenses""?"
3,Not the best choice,I wouldn't recommend this container be used in a vehicle while camping. The spout doesn't seal well and leaks. I keep this container full of water in my house for emergencies. A Scepter military style water carrier is the best bet for vehicle use.
