2,Informative and Unorganized,This book is nice if you don't mind skimming four hundred pages in search of the interesting stuff. What a great book this could have been if it were not so hard to follow. It gave quite a bit of miscellaneous information about people and events that aren't very relevant to Elvis's life. I also found some of Hinton's takes on a few of E.C.'s songs to be a bit over-analyzing. But this book really does have a lot of information that would be hard to find anywhere else.
5,INCREDIBLE!!!!,"This is the ""diet"" book for your soul!!! With humor and incredible wisdom, our struggles in life are explained to us. But even better, we are given tools to ""shrink"" our but!! Thank You Thank YOU!!!"
2,Only for hard-core Christmas album collectors,"To put it short, the only songs that stand out are the Busta Rhymes/Jim Carrey collaboration, and the song by the Eels. All the rest are a disappointment. If you're looking for Grinchy songs, get the original Grinch TV Special Soundtrack. The only reason this gets two stars is because the Busta Rhymes/Jim Carrey ""collabo"" and Eels songs are very good, while all the rest are very bad (especially the 'N Sync)."
5,"great, fun CD...for a WONDERFUL movie","My daughter loves this CD, cause it reminds her of the great movie....I love it cause it's fun....and it reminds me of the great movie!"
4,not involved with the PS1 game,"Read the title again. But it does have christmassy songs that were heavily featured in the movie. It's a nice thing to listen to to get into the christmas spirit and it's gotten me cheered up a little as well. I gave it 4 stars because not all of the score is GREAT, but some of it is. There is also movie dialogue that everyone who saw the movie knows. The game, however, barely has anything to do with the movie but that is okay. I like ""GREEN CHRISTMAS"" by the Barenaked Ladies and ""Lonely Christmas Eve"" by Ben Folds and some of the other songs are better than others that are all based on Christmas which results hands down overall in roughly 4 stars."
5,Good CD,Ordered this mainly for one song as you can only get it on the CD. Love the movie commentary mixed in with the songs.
5,great weight and size,Discraft makes the best disc. This is such a better disc than the ones at walmart. It is smooth and just flys out of your finger tips. Its pretty thick so its pretty good against abuse.
4,"Good weight, glows as advertised, but has burrs","I'm really happy with this disc - the luminosity of the glow-in-the-dark pigment isn't too high, but I haven't come across any other glow-in-the-dark flying discs that work well without any battery power. It has good visibility in the daytime and evening.The weight of the disc provides for stable throws that will go far with a good arm, and the it's pretty easy to catch. It might be a little too heavy for young children.My only complaint (and reason for 4 stars over 5) is that my disc came with tiny burrs left over from the manufacturing process on part of the rim. They are barely noticeable, but although an experienced thrower with a calloused hand won't be affected by them, the casual thrower might develop a cut after an extended throwing session."
4,Interesting Disc,This disc takes a little time to get used to. I started playing around with a 200 gram disc and the switch to 175g was weird. 25g doesn't seem like much but it really is for discs! After i got used to the weight i had fun changing the color. it turns quite quickly but takes much longer to return to the solid white. all in all awesome disc.
3,Not easy to hold!,"Comparing to 2 other different brands that I have tried, this one is not very easy to hold and throw specially if you have a little nail on your fingers. Very heavy so when you catch it , can hurt as well.Also it doesn't float on the water since I use frees-be in the ocean. I really don't care about the night glow that this model has. I purchased Aerobie Superdisc at a local store which doesn't have the above problems."
5,Discraft are the Ultimate,Been playing ultimate on and off for over 20 years and I've always preferred the Discraft design over the Wham-O 175.
3,Not so glow in the dark,"Glow in the dark technology is not quite there yet. It doesn't stay ""charged"" with the glow in the dark light very long. Still is a good frisbee for the price."
5,Ultimate!,"The disc was great. For some reason the discraft frisbee's float much better thank most other brands. When i took it to my usual ultimate frisbee group i play in on the weekend, it is now the preferred disc to use. good stuff."
3,"Works well, but looks USED","I purchased this frisbee new, so I assumed it would look to be in somewhat new condition. Instead, I open the package and I find the ""new"" frisbee all scratched up across the edges and the face. There also appears to be some layer of stickiness to it that this sort of plastic really shouldn't have if in new condition. (It's not a packaging problem either because I ordered 2 other things and none were in similar condition.) I would've rated this product 5 stars as it flies well and does what I want it to do, but I docked off 2 stars because I expect a new product to be new when it definitely was not in this case."
4,Great disc,"This is a great disc at a good price and was received promptly from the seller. My only concern was that the seller ships these in soft (albeit padded) packaging that, it seems to me, puts the discs at risk of warping. However, my discs arrived undamaged, and I was very satisfied with this purchase."
5,exceeds expectations,Ultraviolet frisbee works just as described. Changes color to purple in daylight and my son loves it! Frisbee is also good quality and cannot be beat for the price.
5,"It flies, and I can see it... lol","I needed something to bring to the beach in the summer and to parks/cookouts. I remember Wham-O brand from when I was in grade school, but after reading a few reviews, I decided on the Discraft. There were so many colors available, but I chose the lighter one because it's easier for me to see at the beach. Friend of mine had the same model/color and I spent less time saying ""Where did it go?"" as it was getting dark.I also got this to keep in my car for the summer time. I'll have to see how it holds up when it's left in a 100+ car for a few weeks, but I can't imagine the thing warping. For the $$ ( ~$8.00 at the time), it's gonna be a fun time."
5,surpasses stash in overall quality,"i was amazed when i heard this. every song on here rules. it's like they just took all the good things about stash and made it better and longer. great grooves, totally fuzzed out, feelgood stoner rock. i feel awesome when i listen to this, it immediately brightens my day."
4,Pretty Good. Better than most,"This book has been around and is recognized as the key to understanding commitment phobia and the behavior. I would definitely recommend it, but some of the discussions run on longer than necessary. Kiss & Run by Elina Furman takes the concepts in a simpler and more succinct direction. Both books together are a great resource to understanding. So, bottom line - 1st choice is ""Kiss & Run"" followed by this book."
2,nothing new,I had a hard time reading the book because it was printed on cheap paper and it seemed in small type. I don't know if this is self-published but it had that feel to it. Other than that I thought the examples and advice was what I might have gotten from a girlfriend for free.
1,NOTHING like Aveda Tea,"I was SO excited to have found tea that tastes like aveda tea without the price. Based on the high reviews, I figured I would give this tea a try... I just received this tea and it tastes NOTHING like Aveda tea. It does not that that great licorice after-taste that makes you want to have another sip like Aveda tea. This tea also has cinnamon which is not in the Aveda tea at all. Overall, I would NOT recommend this tea to anyone who is looking for Aveda tea. It is very minty and has cinnamon in it."
1,The Iliad It's Not,"I should have known from the title that this was not going about the Trojan War. The movie is a hokey love story far removed from the original war epic of the Iliad. Paris seems to have taken over the character and physical prowess of Achilles, and all Greeks, including Achilles, are turned into unscrupulous cowards. Homer is turning in his grave. I suppose Hollywood felt that love stories sell better than war movies."
4,Helen of Troy,"For the times great movie, not sure if it followed exactly thetrue story. Watch the recent usa movie and compare for fun."
3,Diamond Review,"I purchased a 3 watt Maglite Bulb from Home Depot, and also purchased this bulb thinking it would be brighter. I was wrong. The Maglite is noticably brighter, and costs around $17.00"
5,My wife's favorite,"My wife asked for this product several times, and was ecstatic when it arrived in the mail. Apparently it is the best she has found for her hair. I think it's a great product because of the brownie points I got from her!"
1,Don't Buy This,"I'm shocked that all the reviews on this were 5 stars. I used this once and then poured it down the drain (along with the money I paid for it....). I should have looked into the ingredients before purchasing. This is just water, alcohol and perfume basically. My hair is colored with a couple of highlights, so I don't want to put a product full of alcohol on my delicate hair. Alcohol is not good for anyone's hair, but especially if you have color or highlights in your hair it's a definite no no.The seller that I purchased this from was top notch, immediate shipping, but the product stinks. I completely wasted my money on this one.I don't normally write reviews but when i was doing my hair last night I was saying to myself what is wrong with my hair and this was the only product that I used that was different, so I thought I'd share my experience. Not worth another try : ("
5,Tikvah Means Hope,"The story of Oakland fire is intense, but the story of people who made itthrough that fire, wtih immense losses, but great resilience and newfriendships, that story is heartwarming and memorable. Of course, kidslove the cat story, but I won't spoil it by telling."
2,didn't work,"I was happy to see an oil control product that was more clean, not loaded with chemicals, or parabens, but it didn't work for me.It wasn't shine free from the start, & after an hour or two, I was blotting oil like usual.I was happy to see the positive reviews, and willing to give it a try.It would've been nice to have to have in my teen years, the salicylic acid probably would've helped with breakouts.Maybe I didn't give it enough time to work. I only used it for a few days.I'm going to give it another try before giving up on it.If you do decide to try it, use a light applicaton. Too much just flakes."
3,It looked like a good deal.,"After 1 week of learning on this bag. It was way too slow even inflated as much as i dare. I replaced the bag and had no problems with the higher quality bag but, after two days the swivel broke. I would recomend buy a high quality bag and swivel or set if you plan on using it for anything more than decoration."
2,everlast speed bag good for beginners only,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions, I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED. I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing. Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating. The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating. For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it. For more advanced boxers, spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight. Wraps are not flexible and too short. Bag gloves are unnecessary."
4,Everlast Speed Bag,Easy to install. Sturdy. Would have liked an option to purchase a large bag with the set.
2,Not really feelin this one,"Okay I don't know what the hell they were thinking. If they put the ggod songs from each albun on one C.D. this would have been a vry good album but they had to do two and this C.D. is really not very good at all. I gave it two stars for the amount of enjoyable songs on this album. The only two songs I really got into were Radio stars and let a killa, they were really realy funny songs but the rest were really really whack. Th elowpoint on this album is definately cherry pie it sounds like a cheesy work out video song. oh well Hopefully when dark lotus finally comes out it will be another step in the right direction"
5,Awesome,"This review is for both parts of the Bizzar albums funny,catchy and well worth the price of both. ICP at the peak of thier popularity which they acheived with almost no radio and/or mainstream music channel coverage. An empire built all on thier own. For those who rip on them they have accomplished more than almost all of you ever have and probally ever will. And they did it in clown makeup."
3,be aware of the light color description,"The pine looks very realistic, but the overall garland isn't as voluminous as the photo. But the biggest surprise from the picture is that the lights are actually multi colored. Granted it says-multi, but at the time I shopped this item, I didn't realize the description would be different from the picture, nor do I associate the word 'multi' as colored bulbs... Now I'm going to have to switch out every bulb..."
3,Not bad...,"...but why not just buy an iPod? What benfeits does the Sony have that the iPod doesn't? I'd love to hear your comments, because I'm thinking that I need a recording device, and that's the one thing theiPod won't do....yet."
1,MZ-NE410: not much product,"Received for Christmas, Software does not work with Win 98 FE and Sony does not appear to have any other software options. The Sony forum has lots of dissatisfied customers, kind of a junky little thing and does not seem to sturdy. Music appears to have to have (c) encoding so not sure if it will work for non-major lable or non-encoded mp3's or from non-pay-for mp3 sites. Seems to allow you to burn your own cd's to mp3 but so does a cheap cd-r. Plays MD's recorded from a real md player fine although the headphone signal is weak when plugged into another stereo's aux channel."
2,"If you want a recorder to capture and share live music, this isn't it!","I haven't read all the reviews to see if someone else has mentioned this before, but one important thing you CAN'T do with this is record with a microphone, then easily download the music to share in some other manner, and this should be made clear in the description. There is extensive anti-piracy protection that prevents this in both the recorder and the software, and the only way to do it is to capture the audio from the analog headphone output real time, then redigitize it, changing the sample rate, etc. If sharing live recordings is what you want to do, get a more modern digital recorder, of which there are many good ones."
4,Heartwarming Way To Discuss China Adoption Issues,What a wonderful way for my child to freely discuss her thoughts about her adoption from China! This book is a must for her library.
4,Not As Innovative But Still Fun,"I liked this CD. Ben Neill takes some 30 second commercial spots that he made for VW and extends them out into full-length tunes. Some nice Drum-N-Bass grooves with his handy trumpet licks thrown in. Very spy movie-esque. Makes me think of The Italian Job movie.I had originally bought the Goldbug album because it was supposedly an innovative album for the drum-n-bass genre. The individual tracks on that album were kind of hit or miss but I really liked the unique feel of the album and some of the unique things he did with the monster-trumpet-thing and his interesting use of the DNB samples. So that is why I was somewhat disappointed with this album: For all it's charm, it is a little tame. Innovative is not a word I would use for it. But I still enjoy listening to it and it would make good chill-out or study music, especially if you enjoy jazzy DNB, so I do recommend it."
4,Not Bad For a First Novel,"For the guy from Medford, OR who knows everything:foible n 1: an behavioral attribute that is distinctive and peculiar to an individual [syn: idiosyncrasy, mannerism]2: the weaker half of a sword's blade from the forte to the tipSometimes you just need to pay attention."
4,Great Music,This consists of two discs. My preference is for disc #2. All types of music are represented in this double album. Worth the money.
3,A Missed Opportunity,"When i first heard of this album's concept and title, i couldn't wait to buy it, track-list unseen. What a missed opportunity! Rather than ""power anthems"", this CD offers a mis-mash of CCM adult contemporary, covers, and the occasional actual power anthem.I mean, i love the song Butterfly Kisses, but it's not anywhere close to a power anthem. Where's Trumpet of Jesus, by the Imperials? Or My Glorious, by Delirious??A greater disappointment is that some songs aren't even the power version that you've come to know and love. Such as God of Wonders. Here you don't get the outstanding original by Caedmon's Call/Mac Powell, but a cover by Paul Baloche.So, what could have been a double-CD set that never left my rotation became just another shelf filler. 3 stars because these are excellent songs, just not power anthems."
1,I Can Only Imagine,"I was very disapointed with the sound and the voices singing on this cd. I ordered it because I heard the song I Can Only Imagine and it was wonderful, however thie singing on this cd seems to be out of tone, sounds like amatures singing and I hate it. I do not like the entire cd. how sad as I spent good money thinking I was getting a quility of good singers."
1,!!!! WASTE OF MONEY !!!!,"I bought this swivel because it was only 8 bucks I and would like to try it out for myself. The worst, I lose would lose is my 8 bucks. So I ordered it and I never realized the mounting plate was PLASTIC! Why would you even make the plate plastic when you know it has to withstand what it is made for. I never thought that would run through someone's mind when creating this swivel plate, so I never even looked for it to be plastic. On the picture it just looks like a nicely painted swivel, but when you get it, you can not believe someone who knows what this is for created this. BELIEVE ME DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!! PAY A LITTLE EXTRA AND MAKE SURE THE MOUNTING PLATE IS METAL OR YOU HAVE JUST A BOUGHT A DECORATION PIECE IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT!!"
5,absolutely beautiful..,I just got this cd today. I've already listened to it 3 times. All I can say is it's amazing.. I'm a huge fan of Incubus and when I first heard this I was in shock on how amazing this quartet could play.Just get it.. you won't be let down
1,"classical....should stick to classical, not Incubus","I am a big classical music fan, and have just recently been introduced to Incubus, which i do like. I was told that this tribute to Incubus was good so I went out and bought it. Then I listened to it AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! It was aweful. The instruments couldn't play the songs. They were barely recognizable and it just sounded terrible. Spend your money on the actual Incubus CD's."
2,Stings like crazy!,"I bought this sunscreen with high hopes. However despite following instructions to a T and not allowing it close to my eyes, my eyes immediately started stinging, and my skin started burning. Trying to wash it off was very difficult. My eyes stung for over 24 hours. I am going to return this product."
1,Not the most reliable source,"I was very disappointed with this book and I will be giving it to Goodwill or getting rid of it so that others are not misled. On one of the first pages at the bottom of the Acknowledgments, the author thanks U of Wisconsin press for publishing a book that no one else wanted to publish, ""simply because of its length."" Uh, no, it's because it is not a very good or accurate book, yet the author goes on and on about how everyone else is wrong and they don't have anything to back up their ideas. It would be very interesting to understand what is driving this author. He was too busy looking for the crypto Jews in Spain that he has no idea where they went, therefore they must not have existed at all. He couldn't find them because they were busy hiding out in the mountains of Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado, among other places."
5,Extang tonneau covers,These tonneau covers are the best in the world!I've had tree & will always buy them again!I worked at a auto parts/custom shop for 20 years & they where the only tonneau's we sold.
5,Beware Duplication,"""Live at Woodstock Town Hall"" is identical to Disc 2 of ""The Dawn Sessions"".""The Dawn Sessions"", themselves, are identical to tracks 24-34 of ""Glancing Backwards""."
5,Fantastic account of history,"This book was phenomenal. It did everything the author set out to do. I love list books and this one is a gem. I was actually surprised at some of the selctions, but the author makes a good enough case. My list would have been different though.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It can be used as a teaching tool or just a flat out read. I found myself wanting to know more about this historical subjects. Buy it if you can."
1,Broke within 6 months of light usage,"I liked the idea of CD like storage so I bought the MD recorder.., but this unit just broke within 6 months of very light use. I would stay away from Sony in the future."
5,My mother-in-law loves these - I bought her two of them.,"My 101 year old mother-in-law loves the way these feel. They are soft, warm, and well made. She wears them as nightgowns and really enjoys them."
3,Great phone.....for a year,"I owned this phone for almost exactly one year before it died. It was the best phone we ever had. Great range, reception, clarity, easy to use--no complaints. After one year it stopped working. We replaced the battery and that did not solve the problem. Now I'm shopping for a new phone."
3,"All flash, no bang.",It takes much more than pretty packageing to make a good phone. This is the second 2.4 GHz Uniden model I have returned. Both suffered from a horrible echo when spoken in to. It sounded like a three way conference every time I made a call - and I'm usually partial to three ways! The buttons on the handset are poorly laid out - I usually hit two or three buttons with my thumb when addressing the navigation buttons. It does look cool though...
5,We have a library copy at the Goeldi Museum in Brazil,"How strange that Michener's monograph on the Saturniidae (giant wild silk moths, for lack of a better common name) is a useful work I consulted just last week when identifying some moths. I say that because Mich is now going on 90 years old--and still going strong. All the best to this remarkable entomologist, to his works on Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, to his readers, and to the insects he studies."
1,Appendix to book contains pornography,"I thought this book would be a nice addition to Foxe's Book Of Martyrs. However, the author of Torments And Tortures thought it necessary to include artwork from ""contemporary artists"" in the appendix, and it's a collection of twisted and blasphemous drawings of Christ in pornographic positions, if you can believe that.I would NEVER recommend this book to anyone. In fact, because of its pornographic blasphemy, I strongly warn others to avoid this work altogether."
1,"Hasbrouck, the author I'd least like to have over for dinner","Wow! This guy really thinks he's something. This book is page after page of just how witty/clever/smart the author belives he is, with very little valuable information. To be honest, I only got through about half of it. I learned nothing except Hasbrouck must really love to read his own stuff. There's nothing in this book you can't find by doing a simple search on yahoo or google. Do not spend money on this book!"
1,Not up to expectations,"I just finished reading this book and was very disappointed with it over all. The quality was not equal to the first two books in the Triliogy. I feel like there was an entire book missing. At the end of Rising Storm we were in Paraguay and ""little Sister"" Alissa had found the Conners. Suddenly in this book we are in Alaska and absolutely no mention of her as if she never existed. Feel it was written in a hurry to get it released at the same time as the movie."
1,Great idea...poor deliverance,"It's the same old song and dance. The left-wing revolutionaries fighting against the right-wing Nazis. Leninist/Marxists versus concentration camps. Science fiction is especially plagued by this utter lack of creativity, and sadly so. The T2 series is no exception. If you want to know who is evil I can tell you ahead of time they have blue eyes (sometimes ""piercing blue eyes"") and/or blond hair. If you want to know who is good, just check their skin color. If they are non-white then they're fighting for justice and freedom. This is not to say that we should be rooting for whites over blacks. I don't mean that. But this predictable politically correct dogma that Stirling serves up is so by-the-book that it lacks fire and imagination. Stirling has done better in the past and I hope he'll do better in the future."
2,simple,"The music on this CD is quite nice, but more suited to children's free work. Adults and companies and teachers like myself would prefer music that is more sophisticated, uplifting and inspiring."
2,You pay for what you get,This phone offer mediocre sound quality. I sometimes could hear static on the phone at the far end of our 2 story house. I had the base station positioned in a downstairs office. I called Uniden for support because I could not figure out how to shut the ringer. After waiting on hold for an interminable period of time I come to find out that there is no way to shut the ringer off. That really ... and I guess this phone is for people who like to be awakened at anytime of the day or night. Look around and spend a little more money. In the end you will be glad you did.
2,Disappointed,"I expected great things with this phone but when I first start using it in the day, I get static. I would like to send it back and will try to do so. I don't know what I could be doing wrong but I really don't like it."
4,Great TV for the price,"I was looking for a tv that was reasonably priced and with great picture. And I can tell you I was not dissapointed. Compared to my old TV, this one touches the sky."
4,a good book for high schoolers,"I read the book In the Middle of the Night by Robert Cormier. This book is around 180 pages and it is a suspense thirller. The end of thge book will leave you on the edge of your seat.The book begins with a very confusing plot. As the story goes on, it begins to get better until it reaches a climatic end. I was left wondering when i read this quote from the book,""Denny's father's life changed at the age of sixteen."" It turns out that his father was blamed for the deaths of 22 children in a horrible acident. To find out how this happened with details o it, you'll need to need to read the book.This is a good book for kids in or above a middle school reading level. It is worth reading even if you do not understand it in the beginning, it will become clearer by the end. If you continue to read, you will be glad you did."
4,This book was great--I couldn't put it down!,A great mystery. I'd reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries
2,Phil is fly,The book I read was love bytes. my favorite part was the party they had at the @cafe. Natalie was talking with Dylan and they were talking about his divorced parents. I can relate to this a lot beacuse my parents are divorced and its hard to deal with. I didnt like how their was so many characters. the book was hard to read beacuse there was six main characters and in each chapter is a section on each charector. I give this book a two out of five stars for its ability to channel teenage lifes.
2,so so,I had hopes for this show but they did not pan out. I had hoped for more intense plotting and visuals.
3,No subtitles.,"I am rather disappointed that there are no subtitles in this ""Season One."" This was also omitted in ""Season Two.""For people who are hard of hearing and there are a lot of us out there, this is very inconvenient.We can't turn up the volume of the television because it would disturb other members of the family living in the same household.I find it incredible that subtitles are not available for this series.That's why I gave it three stars."
5,Not just a spin off,"Just a great television show from the get go. True it was a spin off of JAG and the name is close to CSI, but this show has a life of its own. It is obvious that while the plotting is great it is the rich development of characters that make this work. Cop and detective shows abound, but can you care about the the characters? Casting was superb as well as everything else about this show."
5,Here you have what innovation means!,"If there are two aspects worthy to remark about this original series, one would be respect the magnificent, clever and acidic comments while the investigation takes place among the integrants of the team. Gibbs (Mark Harmon)is the master and commander of the bunch as well as his main alter ego Di Nozzo (Michael Weatherly)is the smartly irreverent guy, making comparison with famous films of the past, apart his double sense jokes, the forensic Dr. Mallard (David Mac Callum) giving us his erudite comments far beyond the issue he is dealing with, but who really steals the show is Abby Sciutto (Paulette Perrett): her gothic way of life, dressing style and original personality adds a tinge of smart humor respect the different cases to resolve, and no matter how hard the task be, you always will find out more than a reason to enjoy and delight with this series.One of my favorite ones, since the very moment to be released."
2,"Great show, bad disc","I received the box set in wonderful condition, but one of the episodes was a corrupted file and so it is digitally glitchy and skipping all over the place. But because the show itself is so good I will still give it 4 stars."
1,Only a minor audio problem - should have been 5 stars but I goofed,"I bought this set a week ago and have shot down far more summer time than I should have watching it! Since I didn't tune into NCIS until the 2nd season, this first season set has filled in gaps in the story line. It's well worth watching.With regard to the question about the audio quality in the first bit of ""Missing"" after the opening credits: there is one small ""pop"" in the middle of one word in my set. I might not have noticed it if I hadn't been listening for it. (It's like a ""pop"" on a vinyl record, but mine usually have more than one.) It certainly didn't interfere with my understanding the dialogue. I hope that helps the earlier poster decide whether her set is defective.Note months later: I didn't mean a 1-star rating. I meant a 5-star rating. Can't seem to change it now. Sorry."
1,NCIS Season 1- wrong language in episodes,"I love NCIS and am buying each Season one at a time. I orderd Season 1 and on disc 5 and 6 most of the episodes were in Spanish. Amazon was great with the customer service and was sincerely sorry for the mishap. They exchanged it at not cost to me. I received the 2nd set of Season 1 and the same thing - discs 5 and 6 had most of the episodes in Spanish. This time I opted for the refund and returned the set at their expense.I have to say though, that Amazon has great customer service and make sure that customer satisfaction is met, so I had no problem with the issue ultimately. I did get Season 2 and had no Spanish episodes on it. I later bought the Season 1 at a store- I havent reviewed it yet though. So, just be leary of ordering Season 1. Amazon did report it to the problem resolution section for review and resolution."
3,investitgation,the programs and series is good but when I purchasced this product I thought I was buying it new. come to find out it had been use and broken and then sold to me as new. it has been replaced by amazon. yet this is something if I am buying it full price I expect it to be new.
5,One the best shows on TV,"NCIS has to be one of the best shows on TV! The show stars Mark Harmon as Leroy Jethro Gibbs who lead up the Major Case Response Team. The show also stars Michael Wetherly as Anthony ""Tony"" DiNizzo as a former cop , Sahsa Alexander as Caitlin Todd former Secret Service, David McCallum as Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard and Pauley Perrette as Abby Sciuto, Forensic Specialist.This is great shows that combines both drama with comedy, that comes with many twist and turns. Season 1 introduces the team and crimes that Navy and Marine personal and their families. The high points of season 1 include ""The Curse, Dead Man Talking,and Missing""This is a great show that keep the viewer interested and a show that should not be missed by anyone."
5,ncis season 1,"When Ncis started out s we all know it started on another great show, Jag, and I was so excited when they made this show. I love Mark Harmon always have. His character is so believable and the rest of the characters are right on track. I dont think the show would be the same if they other people playing these characters. It's like these characters were built around the the actors, or for the actors anyway. This box set was the beginning for me When I got it I was excited I was ready to get the rest of them. There is not alot of commercials at the beginning in fact it has a button to choose the watch the ads. cool huh?"
4,An inspiring story,"The story of Anika is one that can best be summed up in one (old)sentence: ""If revenge is sweet, why does it leave such a bitter taste?"" (this is from the book, too). Anika burns with the thought of revenge against those who have wronged her. As such, she decides to dress as a boy and earn a knighthood. Sir John takes her into his household to learn to be a knight and to serve him as long as he serves the teachings of Jan Huss.This is a story of not only a young girl fighting for what she believes, but also the history of the church during the 1400s, which was rife with corruption. Jan Huss preached against the things that were wrong in the Church.The premise to the series is that there are women descended from Cahira O'Connor who rise up to fight against injustice. It should be interesting to read the next 3 books in the series."
1,Headband,Disappointed in the quality - was supposed to be a gift - it came later than expected - I still have it - don't know what to do with it.
2,quality so-so.,"The quality was not the best. I wanted to own the product because it is a great movie. But the video quality is mediocre. The packing of the product is flimsy and the movie jacket appears to be a copy. The ISBN number seems like it was copied....good enough, but still looks shoddy."
2,Not Mac compatible,"Beware ! Despite being labeled as ""Mac"" compatible in the summary description, this product will not work on an Apple computer sold in this century. It is only compatible with Mac OS 8.5 and lower. I bought this item, and when it arrived I realized it was compatible only with ""Mac classic"". I requested a refund and the seller (""Ladybug Landing Shop"") promptly agreed."
2,This unit blows,"Less than a year after I bought it, the thing started cutting out while I was on the phone. The person on the other end of the line couldn't hear me. I sent it back for repair, they did something to it, sent it back to me..............same problem!"
3,"Good value, for the price","This is an excellent TV to have for the kids to play video game sor to have as a second TV in the bedroom. The only flaw is that the picture quality is not as crisp or sharp as other brands. I was also not crazy about the exterior of the TV being white, but overall - it serves its purpose. And for the price, this is a great value!"
2,Not what I thought it would be.,"This game was not what I thought it wouk be. The ad for this made it sound like fun, it isn't."
2,BORRRRRRRRIIIIIINNNNNNNGGGGGG!!!!,YAWWWWWWNNNNN!!!!!! I forgot how boring Atari games of old use to be. Man! This is the old old OLD style Atari games. Unless you are really into the nostalgia of seeing these old dinosaur of games... don't waist your money.
2,"Unfortunately, the classics dont hold up","I am glad I paid as little as I did for this game, because I maybe played it for a half hour. It has a nice selection, and Crystal Castles is a cult favorite of mine and the reason I really got the game. But besides maybe Centipede/Millipede, the others dont hold up, in particular the 2600 games which look terrible today by ANY standard. When your average cell phone game has better graphics and gameplay, you know a game is old. Get it for the nostalgia of playing some old ""classics"". Just dont expect them to provide the same thrill as back in the day."
2,"Great games, terrible interface","I have never seen a menu system come so close to ruining a video game. It seems designed to make it hard to find any game, much less the one you are looking for. Add to that the loose controls and reduced access to multiplayer and I wish I had never bought this game. That is in spite of the fact that many of the games included here are still a blast to play on a good emulator. If anything, get this to look at old games rather than to play them."
1,Total crap!,"Just like all the other reviews, it started skipping like crazy after 1 week. Sometimes it would work fine, and then it would go crazy and start skipping like it was in fast forward mode or something. It even skipped on brand new CD's! I am in the process of returning this junk to Amazon. I think I'll get a Pioneer CD changer instead, they are supposed to be the best. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this piece of junk. I'm VERY dissapointed in JVC."
5,Truly Amazing,"Imagine being so fed up with the day to day activities of a ho-hum suburban life, a typical job, a typical car, etc. that one day you decide to cash it all in......for a bike!! And dump your fiance while you're at it.Steven Roberts did just this. Sold the house, cars, quit his job to begin his long (and true) trek across the United States. Armed with a CB, a sattelite uplink, a laptop computer, and other high tech gadgets (circa late 1980's) he writes about his journeys in a fascinating manner. This is what MTV's Road Rules is....for adults. What is amazing is the people he meets along the way, the sites he sees, the trials and tribulation of finding water and getting a flat tire. I can't give enough praise for this book, and would love to read anotehr one if he has one."
2,one word says it all: YUCK!!!,"I live in a tornado zone, so putting together a survival kit has kept me busy. In addition to MRE's, I decided to go ahead and purchase some freeze dried food. After some research, I purchased this well-known brand based on other's reviews.Fortunately, we haven't needed to try them as a result of a disaster. We did decide to try a couple of meals ahead of time to see how they taste.My spouse had the Beef Macaroni, which tasted okay. I tried the scrambled eggs and bacon, which on other websites received rave reviews. All I can say is, it will have to be a disaster of epic proportions that last several days before I would eat these voluntarily. Yuck! I can not and will not recommend these, except as a necessity to survive. If this is one of the better brands, I'd hate to taste the others. Anyway, that is just my opinion."
5,72 Hour Meal Kit,"Read the hiking magazines or visit the outdoors stores and you will see that Mountain House is the premier maker of hiking meals. I bought this item because we were going hiking for several days and it's easier to just buy this collection than individual packets. The kids like the meals, and my kids are picky as heck. If you wanted meals for an emergency this would be perfect as well since it has a shelf life of something like 10 yrs."
5,Wonderful Facial Moisturizer/Hydrator,"I have been using L'annine for the past several years to treat eczema. I pretty much stick to the avocado because everything else is a little overpowering for me. Just recently, I began using L'annine on my face, as I live in the desert and my skin gets very dry, especially in winter. I've tried many expensive creams and lotions over the years and I am delighted at the results I have seen with L'annine (the price is an added benefit!). The fine lines and wrinkles on my face, which were so noticeable just a few weeks ago, have dramatically improved and my skin feels hydrated and soft. Please don't hesitate to try as a moisturizer for the face. It's really wonderful and a little goes a long way."
4,Good Remote,"Works on VISTA media center computers. Not as good as the remote that came with my HP, but is a good backup remote."
1,fake bake,"I got this product because I was in love with the fake bake spray that i bought at the salon. The spray is hard to do yourself so i thought the lotion might be easier. The lotion is easier to use but does not have the same results as the spray. I did not really like this product, you look tan until you shower than it all washes off. But for the time you have it on it is a nice brown, not orange at all."
4,Works better than anything else BUT...,"This is by far the best self-tanner I've ever used. My skin has never looked more naturally tan without the sun. However, I only give it 4 stars because I was one of the few who had an allergic reaction to it: lots of little itchy bumps on my arms. I'm really bummed about this because I thought I finally found something I could use forever and save my skin from sun damage. All in all, great product and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,"Looks great for a day, two if I'm lucky...","I followed the direction down to the very last word, but it only lasts for a day on my skin. Don't know if it's the product or my skin, but it doesn't last."
4,Hides all the imperfections,"The Fake Bake tanning loition is great. When you first open it, you dont think it will be worth the time. It's very oily and slimey.Once you put it on you would never know its a fake tan. It smells great, hides all my stretch marks and makes me look like I spent a week in Cabo San Lucas.If you want to look tan, get the Fake Bake stuff. The ladies love a tan man ;)Jim ClareyHoboken NJ"
4,Good product,"Product goes on darker allowing you to see where you have already applied. Smell is not so good though, but that's expected.It does rub off onto lighter color sheets, you definitely need to let it dry for a while, and make sure you shower the morning after putting it on or the color will rub off on your clothes."
1,will give you a glow hives rashes and some pimples.,Okay so I was so excited to try this because of all the rave about it online it does give u a nice glow but it was giving me hives when i used it it didnt give me a tan tho only a glow. and the bottle if your doing a full body deffinitaly is not enough for no more than 4-6 uses. and thats probley how many times you would need to use it to even get dark not worth the money.
2,Will not use again,"I tried this product at first on my foot to make sure it didnt turn me dark brown in one day. it showed a little color, so i figured it would build gradually which i liked. I applied the lotion on day one. looked a little darker. Than applied on day two and woke up the next morning with little bumps all over my arm. The day went on and i got little bumps everywhere, including my face. the bumps lasted for about 3 days. I have never had an allergic reaction before, but im assuming thats what happened. I want to use it again but am too scared. =( wont be using ever again."
2,a mess,"I gave this 2 stars because you can obtain a dark, nice tan for a special occasion.That said, this product is a mess to use. THE GLOVES ARE CHEAP AND BEGAN TO TEAR APART AFTER THE SECOND USE, leaving dark, cancer looking spots on my hands for days.Bottom line, if you are willing to jump through hoops to look pretty for a special party and need instant results, this is fine. Otherwise, use one of the cheaper and more reliable products, like L'oreal. You will achieve the same results over the course of 3 days, minus the mess."
3,It's alright...,"Pros: I got somewhat dark.Cons: It smells bad, it takes forever to apply, and it wears off quickly.If I had time to apply it every other night, it might be better. It takes so long to apply it though, so I find myself just saying forget it. I bought Sun Self Tanning Lotion Ultra Dark Instant Tint..and it worked so much better! I am darker the next day, and it takes like maybe 5-10 min to apply, compared to 20min with Fake Bake. It doesn't smell bad either. I would try this instead!"
3,It was OK,"I applied it 3 nights in a row to get the color I wanted. I was discouraged the first night not seeing much of a change but decided that I like the gradual increase in tan rather than one big change that some other tanners offer. I agree that after showering the tan fades. The best of the color lasted about 3-4 days for me. I used it on my face and liked the color it gave; I have large pores and it didn't make me look speckled or anything. If you want to look tan for a specific event, I would recommend using this 1-2 nights right before that event and don't count on it lasting more than 4 days."
2,Mixed feelings,"From my experience with this product I would not purchase it again. I find that it does smell and has a lingering smell after applied to your body. Not unbearable but not the most pleasant. Also it takes very long to try. I read some reviews where others say it dries quickly. NOT the case. The first time I used it i went a bit heavy with the lotion and after an hour I still was not dry. The second time I used it I used a much lighter coat and the product still does not dry fully and smears and stains anything upon touching it. I find that the next day after I use this product it is about 3-4 shades lighter and almost un-noticeable. For facial use - if you have any sort of blemishes use scarcely. This product darkens deeply any sort of blemishes drawing even more attention to them. Overall while this product does provide a natural looking tan with no orange/blotchiness at all, I would not recommend it and will continue to search for a better product."
4,Fake Bake: So Far So Good,"So far Fake Bake is the best fake tan I've ever had. It is not at all orange and after the first three applications stays on for about 5-7 days. After that I just use it once a week and that's all I need. The following month I start over again with exfoliating the first day then applying it 3 days in a row. I have not had it stain anything. I wear long pants to bed on the nights I apply it, rinse in the morning and I'm ready to go. I will buy Fake Bake again."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This was to be a camera for my daughter - Good brand, nice features, easy to use, decent price. What a piece of junk. I own several other digital cameras - high end to point and shoot. I could not get this camera to focus more than 1 out of 5 tries. I EVEN READ THE MANUAL!!! Still no better. I tried well lit subjects, high contrast subjects. At the end I just tried to get it to focus on a very patient, non-moving 7 year old. No luck. Maybe I got a lemon, maybe ... I don't know (and likely won't find out). I sent this one back, gave my daughter an old sony. She's happy, I'm happy.... Try something else is the bottom line."
1,The worst Nikon ever,"I had always though that Nikon brand is one of the top one. How wrong I was...:( This camera is the worst. I own 2 years old Kodac DC3400 2MP and believe you me this camera takes better quality, crisp photos not like Nikon. I could not focus this camera in more than half of the times. The time of flash to reload is a way to slow (you're talking about 3 to 4 sec minimum). The photos of the moving people appears so blury that it seems like I had tryed to shoot a ""flighing"" Formula 1 race car on a track. After more than 6 hours of frustraction, I am bringing this camera back to the store."
2,There are better cameras out there,"I am very disapointed with this camera. The only good thing that I can say is that the camera has a pretty cool swivel lens which allows you to take pictures at all sorts of weird angels. The quality of the pictures are also good.Everything else is pretty bad. Because of the position of the lens, it is VERY easy to get a fingerprint on it. I have many ruined pictures because of this. There is also a red eye problem with this camera. In almost all the pictures that I have taken with the flash on, the people had red eye. Also, there is no viewfinder. Taking pictures at night is a real pain with this camera because all you can see on the LCD screen is black. It can take a few seconds before you begin to see something on the screen, and even then it is very hard to make out what your camera is pointed at.If you were thinking about purchasing a Nikon Coolpix, don't. There are better cameras out there."
1,STINKEROO!!,"What makes these country music (if you can call it that these days)celebrities think they can come in and take over the television medium? It would be fine if she had any semblance of acting ability but all Reba does is whine, moan, bug her eyes out of her sockets and scream her lines as if she were projecting to the back row of a 30,000 seat arena. It would also make a difference if the show were a little more consistent but it is not. One minute she's complaining about her daughter (Cheyenne) and her lifestyle or her ex-husband's new wife....then the next she's out contradicting everything she just complained about. The writing is terrible which hampers the direction and the supporting cast seems deficient in the light of McEntires artificial thespian abilities. In essence...this show, for me is a stinkeroo!!"
1,THE SECOND SEASON IS EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST!,"This program has very little redeeming qualities. The main problem is that it glorifies dysfunctionalism in a way that makes it appear o.k. McEntire is a good traditional country singer but a complete failure in the acting department, overacting and performing over the top which make the other actors who appear with her try too hard. That being said, the first season was terrible and things have NOT improved with each succeeding season."
1,McEntire Needs to Give it Up!!,"Different strokes for different folks to use a time-worn cliche'. This is just my opinion but for some reason this redheaded, overrated, obnoxious singer named McEntire thinks she can act (she cannot act her way out of a paper bag). The first season was made palatable only by her supporting cast. The second season (this one) features a new opening and control freak McEntire using all of her amateurish acting techniques to mug and overract her way all over the place making the others in the cast look bad. Its a show that has gotten progressively worse as the seasons have progressed. I can't believe I allowed myself to be talked into buying this rehashed ""ROSANNE"". That is exactly what this show is and it doesn't even merit one star! It is pathetic and unbelievable. Diva McEntire (with her phony face)needs to give it up!!"
5,Let's eat!,"Who touched my Peruvian shepherd?! Seamus, my toys are not play things! Can't I have anything of my own in this house?! GOD BLESS IT!"
3,TERRIBLE PACKAGING,"Strangers with candy is undescribeably funny.the packaging on the complete series is awful.Flimsy cardboard, and disc holders that simply do not hold the discs in place. Spend the extra money and buy each season seperately!"
2,I am more disappointed with the service than the product...,"I ordered this item about a month ago, and just recently did I receive it in the mail. I had ordered sugar-free for my significant other, and I was too caught up in finally getting them to realize that they sent me the wrong kind. It's not much of a loss though, I suppose I'll just keep them for myself. (Although I am not the sickly one.)"
1,Digital Rights Management,The DRM of the supplied software is an impudence: Transferring music from and to the device is restricted to four times either-way. Since I won't let sony tell me what to do with my data I returned the device immediately!
2,Not good for downloaded music,"This product is fine if you want to transfer music copied to your PC straight from a CD, but it will not transfer any files downloaded from the most popular music services - Napster,MusicNow, etc.. Even music purchased from RealOne cannot be transferred, though the player is compatible with RealPlayer software. I don't understand the point. The software is cheesy at best, very frustrating at worst. My recommendation is to buy an MP3 player compatible with MS Media Player. I've used these and they are painless and there's no dealing with under funded proprietary software."
4,A complete kit makes it easy to enjoy music anywhere anytime,"Sony has a reputation for producing quality audio products. Today we take a look at one of their newest high speed Network MiniDisc player/recorders. The MZN510CKKIT comes with many appealing features that make it a viable choice in this mp3 player dominated market. This high speed NetMD has a recording speed of 32X, plays raw mp3 files, Atrac3, wav, or wma, comes complete with a car kit and finally has 56 hours of playtime on a single AA battery! As previous owners of a Sony MD player/recorder we were eager to see how things have changed and are these changes good or bad? (full review @ bytesector.com)"
4,Great Price - Packaging could be better,"I purchased a 3 pack and everything is in order except for a small amount of dust from the filter material originating from the AquaClear box inside the Amazon shipping package. When I opened the AquaClear box, I found that each individual filter sack was sealed in a clear plastic bag, but there was a small hole in each one that was intentional, not a rip, and it lets dust from the item fall out. The blue AquaClear box was also warped and taped shut with a small piece of scotch tape which makes me wonder if it sat on a shelf for a long time or was a return item. I would prefer a box that looks brand new and unopened. Can't beat the price though."
5,"Superb Spy Drama-bbc's spy version of ""the shield"".","Just excellent edge of the seat stuff....moral dilemas abound...its just great! But i wonder, if again, we aren't revealing a tad too much about how western security services now operate post 9/11? With that said, I'll be waiting in line for season 4!"
5,Allergies healed through claiming in faith... it works!,"I bought this book back in the '90s. I read it during a time when I knew I'd be able to get into it without interruption and meditate on the scriptures. After reading it, my faith level was very high. I was then able to claim, in Jesus Name, the ability to eat 2 specific foods that previously had produced allergic reactions in me. I made each claim separately, that I could eat that specific food without adverse effects to my body, then promptly ate some of the previously offending food. Voila! These allergies were not life threatening, but had been quite troublesome and I have been able to eat both of these foods without trouble since then. If Jesus said we can do it, then we can, BUT BEING IN FAITH IS THE KEY!!! I would highly recommend this book."
2,Uh ... no.,"Bought this for my nook color. The problems is, it ""activates"" anything I touch as if I had clicked on it. This stinks when I'm just trying to drag something or scroll around. Admittedly, I've only played with it a little (got too frustrated), but so far I can't see any use for this stylus other than as a ""point and click"" device -- which means it's basically useless to me. Also, the tip is this very soft, mushy rubber that collapses as soon as it touches the screen. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because it's possible this thing could be useful for some other device or some other (more patient) user."
4,Enjoyable,Author's words flowed easily and freely forming a good story. Plus she added a mystery and I couldn't put the book away until I read the unexpected ending. Looking forward to Emily's next book.
1,Don't believe the hype,"If you like books with loads of boring, pseudo-intellectual dialogue and an obnoxious protagonist, then this is the book for you.Pros - Descriptions of Amsterdam were well-written, Geertrui's story was reasonably interestingCons - Too long, boring and stilted dialogue, contrived plot, several shallow characters who don't add anything significant but play prominent rolesHUGE disappointment after all the hype this got in the review literature, definitely written for an older audience than teens."
5,I'm Obsessed!!!!!,"I'm obsessed and need help; at least that is what my friends tell me. Like some other reviewers, the minute I got it I watched it. I know it is a television show and they play characters, but the cast is so incredible; the chemistry is second to none. Until the series actually comes to an end, I intend to be on the ""notify me"" list for the next installment! A definite must purchase if you love this show."
1,HT-ZS11 - Electronic Sudoku,"The backlighting was very good and useful. However, even after sporadic use, the unit started to act up. Now after about 10 uses it locks up and more frequently than not, certain keys will not go into the squares no matter how hard you try. Resetting does not help and it happens at any time. Now of course, it is a few days after the return policy has expired and I have a piece of junk.. Don't buy it, you will probably be sorry. If you do buy it , i hope you get at least 11 uses out of it."
1,Cannot recommend this item,This Zopid Electronic Sudoku was purchased as a Christmas stocking stuffer. The concept is good but the performance extremely poor. Three of the squares did not light up at all and the numbers could not be found to be placed in the squares as they are supposed to be. The batteries worked so that was not an issue. Had the receipt been retained for this purchase it would have been sent back to the distributor for a refund. It found a home in the out-going trash. It was bought online after assessing the reviews given for this item. Never again will I buy this way. The HT-ZS11 ZOpid Electronic Sudoku with Touch Screen and Back Light is a total failure. I cannot recommend it at all.
1,Hazel,I just received my second one because the first one was defective. This one is also defective.
5,"A dark, strange journey.","This book starts off a little confusing with seperate threads of the story being revealed. However these threads are gradually woven together into a story that is very interesting and quite well presented. It's not for everybody - there's some disturbing scenes but overall they are there for a reason - despite what some reviewers have claimed they aren't ""gratuitous scenes of gore"". Not everything is spoon-fed to the reader and some things are left a mystery - which is ultimately for the best. The Gap is a pivotal piece of the story but exactly *what* it is isn't revealed; because the characters don't know either.One of the books that's been given a permanent place on my bookshelf. The main character is one of the strongest I've seen in a modern novel - in some ways he's a TV ""good guy with bad habits"" character, in others he transcends the cookie cutter image and becomes a real person.And Ratchet is the best character ever."
4,What's the tallest mountain in the world?,"Attempt to slot this book to a a genre and it'll slither away - on speed. A coctail of dark fantasy, cyberpunk, sci-fi and a good old fashioned ""whodunnit""; Spares takes you to a macabre world with no sugar on top, chillingly close to our own.If you have the money, you can do anything - bash a few bones, burn off your face - no problem - because your ""spare"" is waiting to be utilised on a nearby farm. Jack Randall guards one of these farms run by SafetyNet, but in an uncharacteristic act of heroism - or insanity - he flees the Farm together with some spares.This seemingly innocent start to the story leads the reader through a typically Marshall-Smith-esque maze of about-turns and stomach churning discoveries - all slipped to your subconcious while it was busy digesting the last few pages. This book isn't adrenaline packed. It's more like someone was slowly tickling your brain with a feather.Must be read with an open mind. But it must be read."
3,Stepping back,"After ""Only Forward"" I have expected another brilliant book. However, ""Only Forward"" was so good, that ""Spares"" took from it a lot elements: it seems very similar ideas of Neighborhoods and Floors in MegaMall, The Gap and JeamLand. I don't know was it necesary to fill up ""Spares"" with so many violence and blood. Sometimes seems even action-line forgotten because of description of the violence. In other words, you can feel that ""Spares"" has been written in more cheap-pop manner than ""Only Forward"" (well.. American debut). This is dissapointing. But not so much."
2,What a Snoozer,"The only reason I'm giving Spares any credit is for the premise. Unfortunately Smith hardly deals with the Spares, but rather dwells on Randall who is neither engaging nor sympathetic. The spares are just superfluous characters dressing the endless and useless philosophical ramblings and drug sessions of a cop who wasted his life away. The alter universe of ""The Gap"" could have been cool, but it takes the reader far too long to get there. Not to mention it is so trite to need a drug to enable your mind to comprehend it. Flying malls that house cities is certainly original, but Smith does not do enough to build his future world. If you eliminate most of the drug trips, and life lessons, you are left with a rather hollow story."
1,This is Soft core PORN!,"This is: ""Akira is a shy girl who prefers to spend time alone at her summer house. You can join her as she talks about her private life and her innermost, deepest thoughts."" Copied off the back of the Cover for this Movie. this is NO anime! it is a NR soft porn. Do not buy this based o nthe Review above!"
1,no no no..not Roman,"This is the infamous 'Trooper Helm' which has very little to do with Roman helmets of any time period. Where did ""medieval Roman"" come from? As long as you're aware that this has no basis in archaeological fact this will be fine for you. Otherwise, look to Depeeka helmets (particularly the new ""N"" line) for accuracy."
4,A lot of fun...but hard,"This game is a lot of fun, but there is a steep learning curve. It is a new way of playing baseball and using both controllers and learning all of the controls is not an easy task. However, with that said it is a lot of fun and a great challenge. Games shouldn't be too easy.If you are looking for a MLB title for the Wii you won't be disappointed with this one."
1,Very frustrating,If you thought this game was going to have the same control scheme as wii sports baseball you will be disapointed the batting is more like wii sports tennis and it is extremely difficult to pitch field and bat it is truly a workout it makes my arms sore i actually traded this game in the next day I highly recommend renting this game 1st before purchasing this game.
4,real fun baseball game,"The Wii control is the fun part of playing this game. Siting or standing can make difference on your swinging and pitching. It is not too difficult to master the Wii control to throw a good ball, but it is a little challenge to catch the timing to hit a home run.I checked reviews of this game in XBox and PS3; somehow, Wii version is the lowest!? Well, I can't see much difference on the other 2 platform, not sure why Wii version has the lowest rate.It is a fun game, not super realistic on the image, but good enough to me.If you want to play season and build up a team, this is not the game. If you are looking for some short baseball game after work, and don't want to be bothered for tons of statics and strategies, this is the right game for you. The player list is accurate to me, well.... to my knowledge about MLB.... certainly, it is good enough.have fun!"
2,Hard to follow with the music,"I found this workout to be difficult to follow at times because the people in the video are not going to the same beat as the music. If you don't keep your eyes on them constantly, and let yourself listen to the beat of the music, you will not be synchronized with them the next time you look up at the screen. This gets annoying. The conditioning portion is very good, however, and does not require music. The steps in the workout are a little fast for a pregnant woman who might be a little unsure of her center of balance. I had better luck with some of my ""regular"" step tapes, and just left out the propulsion and difficult moves."
3,"Okay, but poor sound quality","I thought the workout was challenging and very adjustable, but the production quality was poor. The workout got my heart racing, and I was able to use this video through my second trimester. I also noticed that the instructor got off tempo at times."
1,Fell apart in 4 days,"Looks nice and is a nice size but provided screws pulled out after 4 days with barely any use. I can't recommend this, save your money for higher quality."
5,Loved it.,"Dylan is the 2nd. Quinn brother to meet his match. Meggie has been in love with Dylan since high school, but he never noticed her. She was humiliated by Dylan at the prom dance, or so she thought. She planed her revenge, carried it out & then found out she was wrong all along.They say the path to true love never runs smooth & this is certainly the case with Meggie & Dylan. This is a fantastic series that will stay with you after you turn the last page.Next is Brendan's (A writer)."
4,beautiful camera,i am very happy with this camera. i gotten some frizzy picture once or twice but mostly every picture looks shape and clear.Update 10-2012: As of last year this camera blacked out and never turned on again. Sony did not have a answer since it was a older model and pointed me to a newer model!
3,A Little too many commentary articles,"Because 2/3 of this book is just articles on the work, I would not suggest the book if you are just trying to use it to help you remember details of the book. Still, it does have a pretty good summary and fair character analysi"
4,Trouble in Radiant City.,"In the world of tommorow, a man tries to stop a monster of his own creation. His monster is a city whose very structure can drive a person to madness. In addition, the city holds secrets that can enable a wilier individual to control it's inhabitants. Those who know him are either dead, or unwilling to betray him. He remains a mystery. This was the first graphic novel I had read. Although the artwork is simplistic, the story of obsession makes it a thrilling example of graphic novels."
4,u get wat u pay 4,"first of all item u get is not the same model as the one in the picture. the base is different, and the head is actually a lil tilted the side. otherwise very decent wig heads, they do the simple job they r spose to do which is all that really matters."
4,Hikki rocks,"After her all-over-the-place U.S. debut, Hikki is back to making good jpop. I prefer the second song in here though. Also, purists may want to forgo the English version and purchase the single with japanese lyrics. I likeee alot."
3,My Glimpse of Eternity,This book was ok - Probably like most people I read these afterlife experience books in hopes they will convince me that there is some real evidence to support believing in an afterlife. The author of this one clearly has an agenda and parts of it were thinly disguised dogma.
4,Brother's gift,My brother is internet dumb. He wanted it & promised to let me read it when he was done. I think he really loved it because he won't let me borrow it.
5,Great Paper for the price.,"I print calendars for people every year and this paper does the job beautifully. Just increase your contrast, brightness, and saturation a bit over glossy stock and you are good to go. Makes great 13x19 calendar pages and prints."
2,expected better,I really enjoyed the first season. I was very sad the second season did not have the same quality in the story lines. The acting was fine but the stories were not as sharp.
5,Spider-ific!,"I just saw this in the bookstore and I read it right there. Oh, how delightful and heartwarming. This is a great adoption story. I was adopted and I know who loves me best. I am also expecting for the first time and I want to get this book for my children so they can understand. I highly recommend this book."
1,awful awful message for adopted children,"I believe Mr. Kirk's intentions were good, but the messages of this book is horrible. A baby spider is born and wonders where her mom is. A beetle helps her out. (sounds good so far....) I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that the beetle said that if she was spider's mom, SHE would look for her everywhere. The (I hope unintended) consequence of this is that an adopted child is left wondering why their birth mom is not looking for them. Or maybe she is and she might come take them away? Yuck, yuck, yuck. There are MANY reasons why a birth mother makes an adoption plan. Please read this book carefully before sharing it with an adopted child."
5,Fantastic Story,"LITTLE MISS SPIDER is often requested when I volunteer to read with the children at my local library. They love the storyline and that the simple lines rhyme and are easy to recite. I've read other reviewers saying that they were uncomfortable with the aspect of the book that Little Miss Spider does not end up finding her birth mother by the end of the book. In the many times that I've read this book to groups of children, they always feel the story has a happy ending. Little Miss Spider loves Betty the Beetle and Betty loves Miss Spider. They have found each other and have become family. This story helps children who are adopted feel accepted. It may also be some children's first introduction to the idea of adoption and can give them an understanding of some of their friends' families. It's just an all around heart warming story."
4,"Very nice, soothing cleanser","I tried this since I liked the face cream so much. I am so far pleased with it. No reaction from my sensitive skin, so I am hapy with it! It seems very mild."
2,Not for dry skin,"As a rule of thumb, gel cleansers are not for dry skin and as a person who has been on accutane for the past 5 months let me just say that rule holds true in this instance. If you are on accutane or have dry skin in general I would stay away from this product since it just irritated me after only 2 washes. Instead I would recommend Cetaphil gentle cleanser and you will be fine. The night creme is a nice compliment if you have dry peeling skin and need relief, but pass on the cleanser.I can't speak for rosacea/acne sufferer's, so I would not deter those individuals from trying this product. No two people have the same reaction to every product, but if you have dry, sensitive skin - beware!"
1,Great but useless,This is a great idea for teaching kids about coins - info and presentation is good BUT the coins don't fit nor stay in even if you bang them in with a hammer. Kids could NEVER use it.
2,Disappointing,"This book is disappointing. For a book with Coin Collecting in the title, you would expect the coins to fit in the slots. The presidential dollars don't fit as well as several of the other coins."
2,Great Concept - Poor Design,This book would be perfect if the coin slots were designed to hold the coins in... All of the coins fall out of the designated slots. Very poorly designed.
2,Mine turned out to be cheap and unreliable,"I bought one of these because it was cheap and came with a big rebate, and now it's driving me crazy. It locks up at least twice a day, forcing me to get out a paper clip and push the reset switch.Other people on the Internet also report problems.NOT recommended."
1,Major compatibility problems,"I bought two of these routers. I have a D-link DWL-650 laptop 802.11b card, which is one of the most widely used cards on the market. THE ROUTERS DO NOT WORK WITH THESE CARDS. I can establish a connection, and see that the router is there and broadcasting signal, but I cannot get an IP address wirelessly. If I plug in via a wired connection, I immediately get an IP, so I know DHCP is on. I also know my DWL-650 card works b/c I tried it on two other router brands (Linksys and Netgear) with no problem at all. Bottom line: This router is a piece of junk. Save your money and buy something that works."
4,Works....but...,"I used this to install a std radio into my Tracker from the OEM radio. Being as the OEM radio is a huge thing, this item is necessary to complete the installation. It is flimsy and EXTREME care must be taken when breaking off the unused tabs (this is for several different models and removal of tabs for a 2000 Tracker is a must to use it). It can break easily with little effort while removing the tabs.It also may be slightly wider than it should be and minor ""shaving"" may be needed to get a better fit."
3,Not enough songs?!,"The album does have its moments and you can't deny that. However, there are just not enough of these moments - with a total 7 tracks out of the 13 track, which all 7 are superb. However, you have an intro and 3 interludes, which kind of makes the album hollow, since it is simply based on 7 tracks. The remixs are credible. With an album that had a debut single of ""Don't Call Me Baby"" and a second single ""Who The Hell Are You?"" - this album is unfortunately overpriced and even at times disappointing. If the album had another 3 or 4 long tracks the album may have been seen in a new light. OVERALL VIEW - not enough songs, but the ones that are there are gems."
3,B&D 18-volt Cordless Pole Hedge Trimmer,"A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight, but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great, but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work, but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers."
4,Works well up to a point,"I have several high hedges on my property and a gas powered hedge trimmer. The Black and Decker on a pole works well cutting high hedges and relatively fine growth without a ladder. Ocassionally, I use the gas machine when the wood gets thick. Most of the time the Black and Decker is adequate. My neighbor and son in law use theirs with satisfaction."
2,marginal weed whacker alternative,"UPDATE: it is ok on small stiff hedges and dead grass, but does NOT work well on tall green grass. It is heavy, weak, and the battery does not last that long.NOT recommended: get a corded one instead.====================================================================I hate string trimmers, so I tried this as an alternative. I am pleased.Its clean, quite, and works well on tall, thick grass. The adjustable blade angle is important, I used it mostly at 90 degrees, but some at 45 degrees.Its heavy, and its a bit awkward ""upside down"" as a grass trimmer. I'm tall, and the length is just about right for me. Still, probably get tired faster than with a regular trimmer.My assessment as a weed eater:Prosgood with tall thick grasscleanquietless damage to surroundingsConsheavyawkwardlimited battery life plus slow chargerminus 1 star for ergonomics, otherwise looks very good"
4,Pole Hedge Trimmer - Battery,"5', 5"" 165# senior citizen (male) The battery operated pole hedge trimmer is fine for my application. I use it for trimming on a regular basis, not heavy cutting. Overnight battery charge is sufficient for trimming a very long and very tall hedge. B&D should redesign it with the motor in the base handle using a drive string up to the cutter head. Having the drive motor in the head makes it very heavy to lift high overhead. Overall a good product but not great. Nelson"
3,Solid trimming tool for occassional yard work,"I had read other reviews complaining of the weight and cheap construction concerns. I'm not a body builder, but I didn't find it that hard to hold or use. Regarding the cheap construction concern - I was pleasantly surpised with how easily it cut through branches 3/8"" to 1/2"" in diameter. In that regard, it performed very well - better than my old electric corded trimmer. Also, the battery life surprised me - it lasted for more than an hour of near continuous trimming. Overall, I'm very satisified with this product as well of the other 18V cordless B&D products that I've purchased (Firestorm drill, trimmer, & broom vac) - which by the way all share the same rechargable batteries which is wonderful."
4,A very useful tool,I purchased this tool last summer and it works very well. I charged it once and that one charge has allowed me to trim 25 feet of 6 foot high hedge on three different occasions and it's still going. It is a bit top heavy but a lot easier than a ladder and a long extension.Changing the head position is simple and very useful.
1,Spend your money somewhere else,"As a Beanie collector for the past 2 yrs, let me say that Les Fox is no more an authority than my baby brother. Worthless info Crummy pics Incomplete facts. JUNK"
5,The best in Beanie Baby price guides.,It's by far the best Beanie Baby book i've seen yet. It has fully colored pictures of every Beanie Baby in creation and it has games for the youngsters.
1,The Pits,Safe to say I want my money back... This should make TY stop this nonsense. The photos are blurry and copy was worse. Lets just say it is not worth the paper it is written on.
1,Beanie Baby Handbook,"This isnt a very good book for serious collectors. It has very out of date prices. I am sorry that I spelled ""PATHETIC"" wrong in my last entry. People please try and hold back the rude unpleasant comments. Thanks! Great for younger kids."
4,Still Great but.....,I was a little dissapointing due to the lack of commentary ! This season did not even include a greeting from Matt!I understand the rush to get the Twentieth season out for business reasons and as a marketing aspect seeing that this is The Simpsons twentieth year but they could have tossed a few extras in the mix!Over all I enjoyed this season and will continue to buy the box sets.Any fan should its still a great show and even with the lack of extras you get a great season worth of episodes.
1,Shame on you FOX,"Quickly thrown together to cash in on the 20th Anniversary, this ""collector's edition"" is a real shame. No extras, just the episodes. Thanks but no thanks, Fox."
2,Not sure I'm going to buy this,"What a strange concept for Fox to skip past the next several released seasons and go to season 20. From the few episodes I've seen from this season the laughs are still there but not like they were in the older seasons.After seeing the terrible packaging for the last 2 seasons,I'm not sure if I'm going to purchase this or not, might just get it from the library. Fox needs to go back to their old style of packaging where you could actually get your disks out with out scratching them up.(post edit)After reading some recent reviews I see that the packaging issue is still there. :(I posted this before in another review the phone number to Fox is 310-369-1000, if you want to call them and let them know how you feel about the packaging. Unfortunately though, they don't respect the fans enough to bother returning calls, but if enough people call, they may still listen."
2,Not a good buy!!!,"This DVD collection has no commentary, no special features except a preview of the documentary that aired the same night the 20thanniversary episode aired, which is actually not on this season either, though this was released after that documentary aired and really, really should be here. There's no deleted scenes, no introduction from Matt Groening and frankly it isn't even close to the experience the other collections are. For the novelty of owning the 20th season at the time the 20th season aired, it isn't worth it. Booo for making this, it suckered me. Should have been way cooler."
1,only buy seasons 1-10,"after season 10 the simpsons becomes what it is today, an empty shell of its former once hilarious and entertaining self"
5,Better then nothing,"Given the fact that Fox has been slowly releasing the seasons for no reason other than no reason. So by the way they release seasons it would be 2019 or so before we would get this season. I am just happy to get the episodes. I like other miss the extras, but hey I'll take what I can get. I would rather get a season then nothing at all."
1,"NO EXTRA'S, NO SALE!","This not a review of the show, this a review of the product. I love the program. I have all the previous seasons on DVD that have been released so far, and was really looking forward to this one. However, I foolishly didn't read the reviews on it before I had purchased it. If I had, it would have saved me the trip to the post office to return it. AS others have stated, THERE ARE NO EXTRA'S! NO COMMENTARIES, NO DELETED SCENES, NO REASON TO OWN IT! All of the episodes are available to watch/download somewhere online, so why pay $35 for this? I would understand if they didn't have time to do commentary on all the episodes (though I do enjoy them), but to not include any special features is just lame. Please, don't buy this. This mediocrity is inexcusable."
2,The Simpsons Season 20. No Extras?,"I have to say I wasn't too crazy about this season when I watched it on TV, but I was still going to buy it anyway because the Simpsons season box sets usually include a lot of entertaining and insightful extras, but not this one, for some strange reason FOX has decided not to include almost any extras (except a short feature about the Simpsons anniversary) which seems strange, considering this is certainly not one of the best seasons of the Simpsons. I wonder, is FOX going to keep releasing all the other extra-packed seasons (13-19) or continue to give us recent HD extras-free so-so seasons of the Simpsons? I really hope FOX makes this a one time only, and continues to gives the old seasons, or at least gives us some extras!"
2,Worst Simpson DVD Ever!,"You can really tell this DVD was rushed and that 20th Century Fox really has no F@%$ing clue what their doing! I mean yes the episodes themselves are great but where are the commentaries that I've grown to enjoy so much, where are the deleted scenes, where are the old simpson commercials, and where oh where is the intro from always grand Matt ""Futurama"" Groening... the only thing in this dvd release has is a sneak peek to a Documentary that came out two days beforehand. I really find that this was a waste of $28 it would be so much better if it were a lower price. I'm more or less just really disappointed with this DVD. Heres hopeing their next release will more than make up for this."
4,Beating the Sicilian,The Grand Prix Attack is an attacking line against the Sicilian. Mr Lane explains all the main lines with complete games and enough detail to play it with confidence. There are times when Black has good chances and these are covered fairly.A good introduction to this dangerous chess opening.
3,Not the Best Offering,"Burnt Offerings covers very little new ground in the overall picture of the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series, but it does prove that our heroine's actions have consequences, and those consequences have consequences. The firebug plot is pretty much a comma in the main story of the Council of Vampires coming to town to discuss the little matter of the death of one of their number at Anita's hands. The can of worms opened in the tub near the end of Killing Dance gets examined and stirred around into a different sort of mess. My main gripe about the novel is that Ms Hamilton has handled as many plot threads as Burnt Offerings has in the past, and a lot better. Burnt Offerings is definitely readable, but after the events of Killing Dance, I think we all expected more than that."
1,Used to love this series,"Used to love this series. Now there is no plot, and the characters are boring."
4,"A good book, in keeping with the series.","I read a review here that said that this one was the dud of the series, and that one might as well skip it completely and go directly to Blue Moon. I disagree heartily! Granted, the supposed main plot, the fires, quickly fade to the background, and I thought the fire man would play a bigger role, but the Vampire Coucil was more important. Plus, it is traditional for the initial case of the book to fade into the background for the bulk of the book, and then pop back up toward the end.Asher was an incredible character, and I really look forward to seeing more of him. I hope he develops well. I also hope for more development of Anita's abilities, which she uses to great success. The wereleopards are going to be important, too.And the council? Well they can be summed up in Anita's words. ""Incredible power, near eternal life, and they were petty. How disappointing."""
2,Give us something new!,"I love the series, like so many others, but have lately felt let-down by the character development, or rather character degredation, of Anita. With Richard it felt like she had a chance at happiness, not the typical marriage and 2.5 kids, but definately not a nose dive into the true human monster, as she seems to be headed to with Jean-Claude. Blue Moon sounds like a big make-up session for them, and I can't wait. Also, I find Hamilton's descriptions of the weres intriguing, and it makes the vampire community boring in comparison. The weres are more like lost souls, looking for comfort, family, love, and understanding, while the vampires (with some exceptions-Willie McCoy, the new Asher, and on occasion Jean-Claude) sound like a broken record - Blood! Sex! Violence! POWER!! are their only words. I'm hoping that Hamilton will Finally tie some ends up and move on to new ones, but overall I still enjoy rereading all the books and will devour the ones to come!"
3,back but not better,"Way too much. The way I had it, the plot was too condensed. The time line was screwed up, and Edward was missing! While okay, I hope LK isn't going to start suffering from overkill (pun intended). It wasn't up to her usual stuff."
2,"Good book, but it should have follow the old charcter paths.","After reading Burnt offeings, I found myself a little unhappy with the characters that Hamilton created in the other books. I have read the first ones and found that in Burnt offerings that the main character, Anita, was made out to be a lot more delicate. She just had to plant those flowers. Ya right. She can kill a person with out remores but she has to plant a flower bed or play with butterflies as they fly by. And to boot, She had Richard acting way to harshly. I'm sure that gooing on your fiance can put a damper on a relationship, but not that much. I can see why now that she wrote the two to be fighting so much. but that deal with the next book.Other than that I think that Burnt Offerings was a good book, but not one of the best."
1,Lacking in substance,"This book contains titles and summaries for several useful CORBA design patterns. However, on a closer read you will find that it does not contain nearly the depth and breadth of the Gang of Four Design Patterns book. I would love to see someone actually provide detail for the Participants, Consequences, and Implementation sections that were so well documented in the GOF book, but conspicuously absent in this one. What an obvious rush-to-market to jump on the Design Pattern frenzy."
3,"some information, some fluff","Some of the book is informative, especially the ""meaty"" parts from chapter 4 to 6 regarding application design patterns. At the same time, I think there are too many uninformative pages. The lead-up to the pattern descriptions, 78+ pages, is too long, and some of the descriptions seem to wrap well-known concepts (""Framework"", ""Object Request Broker"").Read this in the store if you can. Buy it on company money otherwise :-)."
4,Excellent for my specific purpose,"I use this for my electronic cigarettes, the holes are larger than I need but it works.You need to assemble this item, there are poles to insert to hold up the top piece, they are very flimsy and the entire stand come apart if any force is applied.My solution was to super glue the poles in place and now it is super sturdy. I also trimmed down the poles so it doesn't stand so high.I would take a guess that this is a good inexpensive option for real test tubes but it is not something heavy duty.For my purposes it's 4 stars."
5,It has many purposes!!,"I love this product. I am using it as a holder for my vintage razor collection. It is compact, so it takes up little space. After using a razor, the water can drain from the razor. It works great!!"
1,Wrong item,The product i bought was different.There was no photo on the book's preview.I will be more carefull now on
3,Spend your hard-earned bucks on a different pumpkin book.,"Once you've seen the cover of this book, you've seen it all. All of the pumpkins throughout this book are simply variations of the same theme. If you're after recipes, you'll probably like the book okay, but if you're after carving inspiration, look elsewhere."
4,Good Cd for being the 1st,"This has to be Incubus's weakest release but i cant really blame them they were young when they produced it, and it is still a pretty decent album. some key songs are ""Take Me To Your Leader"" which is probably the best song on the album with crazy and unique lyrics and another good song is ""you will be a hot dancer""."
4,A surprise for new fans of Incubus,"Incubus always has a slightly different style on each album. This album is more to the funk metal side of Incubus, if you can even really call it metal. Four of the tracks ended up on the Enjoy EP, the rest were formerly much sought after tracks that hardcore fans enjoyed. Now released to the masses, this album from the 93-95 era of Incubus basically shows you how they started. Some would say ""What happened?"", because this album is a far cry from what you hear on modern radio today with tracks like 'Stellar'. People that only like THAT Incubus will not enjoy this album. They will feel like Incubus is trying to be the Chili Peppers or something to that effect. Some truly ignorant people might even wonder when Incubus had time to recors this album (thinking it's new). Just push those people back into their little shell of musical stupidity and enjoy how Incubus used to be."
3,"Not bad, but not the best","This cd is alright, a more funky sound then what their new stuff is. The cd has some catchy songs just to chill to, and have fun with. Some songs I dont care for and will skip over,but If your a true fan of incubus you will most likely buy this cd to add to your collection. This cd by far is not their best musically, but I must say its pretty good for being only the ages of 16-19. If your not for sure what this cd will sound like listen to it before you buy."
4,Good down to earth advice..,"I really am glad I bought this book, I am a christian and this book provides good down-to-earth advice on how to go about dating within a christian context without beeing overly old-fashioned and conservative. Its a practical book with real steps to take and was a bit of an eye opener, highly reconmended."
3,Good Book,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. I guess what I didn't like about it was the emphasis on how ""Big"" Wynn was. I got the point pretty much in the beginning of the book, but it was constantly brought up throughout it... Half the time I wasn't sure if Zack really did like Wynn all that much, only tolerated her and the ending came really fast... I think I'm kind of in the middle on this book. It's worth reading though, especially if you like Lori Foster. I'll let you draw your own conclusions!"
2,Better As A Magazine Article,I just finished reading this book last night and wanted to write this review while I could still remember what I read. Mr. Gleick throws so much information at you and most of it is so obvious that this is not the kind of book that will stay with you. There is some attempt at analysis but not that much. This book would have been better as a magazine article because Mr. Gleick could have made his point in a much shorter format. Other than giving us a lot of examples of how technology has accelerated our lives he just doesn't have all that much to say.
2,"A letdown, and an endless list of things we already know...","Faster: tends to wander aimlessly without providing any new insights into our lives or the human condition. The author claims that shorter commercials and movies must include action and explosions to hold us, that our attention spans are decreasing... Faster: doesn't help this situation by not providing an interesting read like Chaos. Maybe I would have finished it had he included a few explosions."
3,"Fun, quick, book but not the most organized","Philosophical ramblings sum it up well. I love Gleik's writing style - Chaos exemplifies it best. I thought this book was interesting, witty, clever, and creative... but it wasn't organized at all, and didn't really go anywhere (like most philosophy books). An enjoyable, quick read."
3,Good but not great,"I think that Chaos is the better book. Short, choppy chapters make the book feel like a non-cohesive whole (probably the point but very annoying). I like Gleick's style and you won't be disappointed if you've read his other books; there's some nicely researched anecdotes and stories. Ironically, if you've got some free time there are worse things to do than read it but afterwards you'll probably feel like you've wasted the time."
2,a real step down from their first,"The first self titled Goldfinger album rocked, but this one just plain sucked. They changed around their style too much and moved away from punk and towards ska. Not to say ska is bad, but Goldfinger can't do it right. They should have stuck with punk. There's a couple good songs (""Superman,"" ""SMP"") but most are just horribly put together ska songs."
1,Not what I expected....,"This book claims 'games' which it does not have. It has one side which is the normals, which only goes into massage, having fun with food, etc. The other side is heavily into bondage, chains, whips, punishment. This book gave us nothing new and interesting to try that we would want to try. Overall we were very disapointed with this book."
3,Wrestling with 2.5 or 3 stars,"Although the book starts off well and definitely captures those initial sparks of meeting someone and falling for them. The slow pace, and the footnotes put me off. The author must have felt his audience was too unaware of pop culture to get his references, but they were not obscure, nor did they require explanation. The ending appropriately explained the behavior of the characters was but very sudden and didn't provide enough closure."
5,GREAT Collection!,"Great collection, with Greatest Hits 1 2 and 3, plus the Live & Rare (which has some great tracks). All together for a great price."
4,Very Important and Necessary Read for All Catholics!,"People seem to have forgotten about the doctrine of purgatory and the importance of praying for the souls in purgatory as well as letting our trials and sufferings go to waste without offering them up for their relief. This is a great book that explains in great detail just what purgatory is about and what the Catholic teaching says about it. I was very impressed by the first few pages that actually cites rulings from the Council of Trent of the 16th century on the issue which itself cites the authority of this teaching as coming from the early church fathers as well. Clearly this doctrine is not a recent ""invention"" but has been accepted and understood from the early days of the church fathers. Everything you've ever wanted to know about purgatory and essential reading for all Christians let alone Catholics."
4,The Gentry Family in America,This is an excellant source for genealogy research. As with most older publications you will find a few errors but the overall information is priceless.
5,Disgusting!!,"Disgusting is how to describe the fact that anyone can watch this movie and still continue to eat meat, drink milk, go to zoos and circuses. This movie made me want to get a job at all slaughterhouses in the world and...well, let's just say..the people shown here should thank God that I am not He. It's disgusting to me that people can treat other creatures, human or otherwise, with such callous disregard. Wake up people. Like Joaquin says, ""Pain is pain...and in some animals, their pain receptors are much more sensitive than in people""."
1,Doesn't work,It does not work and my ipod is now dead. so i spent money for nothing and cannot use my music that is downloaded onto it
1,Does not work.,"Product does not work what so ever. Although I did order the ""USB Adapter for Apple iPod Shuffle 2 Generation"" from the same company and it does work. I guess it's just luck of the draw with this company.."
1,A waste of money,We bought this for our daughters ipod and used it on 3 different computers and it would not work. I do not recommend this product to anyone. You get what you pay for.
1,Do not buy,I bought this for my daughter for her ipod and it will not charge her device. This is a waste of time. I don't usually write reviews but this product doesn't work.
1,Did not work,"I received the item but, when I plugged it in nothing happened. Luckily it wasn't a lot out of my pocket."
3,Bargaincell USB Hotsync & Charging Dock Cradle desktop Charger for,It is difficult to say on this one since I only ordered it last night and it has not arrived yet.
1,Garbage,I purchased the charger and when I plugged it in it did not work!! Left it on charge for two days and nothing happened this was a complete case of you get what you pay for!! Garbage
1,Did not function,"I did not pay very much, for a device that connects like a charger, but the similarities end in the aesthetic."
1,Horrible,"Horrible, didn't work as it said. And you can see how cheap the product is. I would get the official one from Apple"
1,Unsatisfied,"The ad for this item was very misleading. I was under the impression that we were purchasing the actual Ipod Shuffle. In fact, that was what was shown in the picture associated with the ad. When in reality all that was included was the charging station. So we have 2 charging stations and no ipod shuffles. Needless to say we are not at all happy with the way this transaction turned out."
1,"Not pictured product, Did not charge, Fried 3 IPOD's","When I bought this product, the Apple brand name was used, as well as a picture of the original charger that comes with the IPOD when bought. The product received was a CHEAP knockoff, and the picture was later changed to this knockoff. The charger will not CHARGE any of my Ipod's, and when trying to transfer songs, it FRIED THREE IPOD's. Also, even though the add says that it is for a gen 2 Ipod shuffle, the ""dock"" does not fit my ipod, and there is a large gap when plugged in. The ONLY good thing was the pretty blue light, but nothing else. I can't even say the price was good since I now have to buy 3 new Ipod's!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Works great.,Very happy with this product. Works as well as original Apple Gen 2 Shuffle charger but also has a little blue light in it which illuminates whole unit. Cute.
3,long time to charge,"My only complaint about this item is that it takes a long time to charge the batteries. I like having extra batteries for my phone but it can take this thing 8 hours to charge them, which I feel is a little long"
1,This thing did not work!,I ordered this docking station to replace the one I initially purchased. It did not work. The seller at eforcity provided me with a refund.
2,File Under 'Young Adults' Section,"The characters are familiar stereotypes with a plot that wraps-up 'nicely' in a 30-minute sit-com style. A fun romp through establised territory for the first 2/3, after which the plot degenerates into an amazingly unabashed comic strip script (think 'Scooby Doo'and the Mystery Van!).I really cannot imagine that this work is intended for mature readers. Respectfully, perhaps this would be an entertaining story for adolescents? I believe this point should be stressed not so much because of lack of depth to the book, but more as a fair cue to readers such as myself who are lead to this book via Amazon readers' links. This is only fair as the cost of the text is so greatly disproportionate to the content for mature readers familiar with historical fiction; however, I realize the cost is related to the fact that the author is 'self-published' through Random House's Xlibris.com site which is a concept I thoroughly support."
3,Doesn't Live Up to Scarrow,"I read this book while impatiently waiting for the next Simon Scarrow novel. It would seem that this book is nothing more than a less than successful attempt to capitalize on the success of the ""Eagle"" series by Scarrow. In fact, it seems an odd coincidence that one of the central characters bears the same name as one of Scarrow's central characters, Macro.Don't bother with this book. If you are interested in life in the Roman army in the first century AD, start with Under The Eagle by Scarrow."
3,Buy it direct from Xerox,"This review is not about the ink refills or their quality, but about the price being charged by this Amazon vendor. The Amazon vendor is listing the refills at $120 -- when Xerox sells the same thing on its own Web site for $89."
1,Nice keyboard if it worked - no comma or left parentheses,This keyboad is quite comfotable and looks good. Howeve the comma and left paentheses don't wok and incedibly the r has just stopped woking as I type this eview. I've had to copy the r fom the title to indicate which lette it is! It doesn't matte how comfotable and stylish a keyboad appeas - it has to wok!!! This keyboad is used to supplement my laptop at home so hasn't even had a geat deal of use. Vey disappointing.
5,Great Keyboard For The Price,"This was a gift for my hubby who is always a logitech user, and he was very surprised and happy with it! Great Product!"
2,Keys Stopped Working,"I LOVED this keyboard until the keys stopped working. It's a great, lightweight, quiet design and has just the right amount of ""extra"" keys. Unfortunately, two of my letters stopped working half the time or more. I'm having trouble finding an alternative."
2,be careful,"I have used Dell, Gateway, Logitech and other keyboards. This is the only one that DOESN'T WORK until Windows come up. So basically, if you need to select your OS or do work on the BIOS that requires keyboard info, it won't work. Keyboard failure shows up during boot.I'm running it through an internal USB card on a Dell server because the internal ones on the Dell don't respond although being powered up and showing as operational in Windows. I also tried using one of those usb to ps/2 connectors that Logitech thoughtfully includes with their keyboards and mice, still didn't work.So I have to keep an old, beat-up Gateway keyboard around in case I have to do maintenance on the system."
2,was hard to use,"You had to bang on each key to get the letter to type. If you are at least a half fast typest , don't buy this , I had to buy another from HP"
1,failed in a month.,"The feel of this keyboard was great but in a month's time the ""n"" key failed completely and some others work on and off."
1,"Awful keyboard, scrapped in 3 months.","This is a media keyboard, so I didn't expect it a lot. I didn't buy it for gaming. I just use it to do my work and paper typing, but the unacceptable thing is that several keys' ""life expectancy"" is too short. The connection between keycaps and membrane was working in an awful status. Even it only cost nearly 16 dollars, it still need to be usable. I gave up. Microsoft made a lot awesome hardwares, except this one."
1,Hunk of Junk....,Got this in April...it died last week. I was typing along and it just quit. It was keyboard # 2...#1 came with mashed in keys. I'm now on # 3...lets hope this one lasts more than 2 mnths.
4,Good Keyboard for the Price,"This is a good keyboard. I would say it's great, but there was one major flaw with mine. If I leave the keyboard connected to the computer for too long, it seems to quit working. All I have to do is unplug and replug the keyboard and it works again. Other than that the keyboard exceeded my expectations. I am the type of person who eats and drinks around the computer. I did spill a soda on the keyboard and after soaking it in some water and letting it dry, it worked just as good as it did when I bought it. It is also lightweight and one of the better keyboards I have used."
5,great keyboard!,"soft touch, really compact, connects easily without software. multimedia buttons are also convenient. i spilled water on it twice, and it still works great!"
5,Great keyboard and great price,"I bought this keyboard to replace a very uncomfortable one at work. The price was awesome, as is the comfort of the keyboard."
1,PLEASE do NOT buy!,"I wish I had read the one star reviews before purchasing. I am a grad student, and I have to type frequently, so I am extremely disappointed that this product fails. In fact, I am unimpressed with MOST Microsoft products. Many of my keys have stopped working. Namely, one of the keys I needed to type my password for windows 7, so I could not get into my computer, until finally, after trying everything else, Providence told me to SLAM the keyboard down. I should not have to slam my keyboard to get it to work. This product is unacceptable."
1,Keys Stopped Working,The keys stopped working -- I thought I was going nuts. Turns out its a regular problem with this item. Don't bother.
3,Good for simple tasks,"Ok, This is a very good keyboard. Preatty silent to (except for the space that does normal noise :{Why I gave it 3 stars? Becouse if you are playing a game or something else that requires pressing more than 2 buttons at once it won't recognize the third button as being pressed...as I bought it for a little gaming as well I'm going to give it just 3 stars."
1,Beware! -- Long Term Review,"Mine worked great for about a month, then random keys stopped working, and no amount of cleaning or tinkering would bring them back. Trust me, it's really frustrating trying to type a document without the letter 'c!' Next time, I'll cough up the extra cash for a more reliable model."
2,Avoid this keyboard,"I've had this keyboard for only 8 months and now the ""a"" and ""t"" key don't even work and the ""q"" key only works sometimes, but for the months I have had this keyboard it was pretty nice. Overall it's a nice keyboard but will fail quickly."
1,It worked great for a few moths,"Yes, moths. That's the best you ca do whe the """" key does't work. This is absolutely great, I am worki*g o* a research paper a*d *ow I have to go get a*other keyboard from Best Buy. What a piece of garbage. It worked for about six moths before breakig."
2,High Failure Rate,"I like the layout, size, and usability of this keyboard. For the money, it seemed like a good deal for an ergonomic keyboard. However, the first one I bought failed completely at the one year mark. I decided that this was probably an anomaly. I decided since I liked this keyboard, I would try again. I've had the second one for roughly nine months and now, like other users, certain keys are unresponsive such as the 'n.' I will not be purchasing another Microsoft keyboard. A shame given that the basic design is sound."
1,Nothing Redeeming,"This book is not only dated, but cloddish in its treatment of the characters, and with an awful plot to boot. Chesterton somewhere remarked that the common person may prefer detective stories to high literature but is intelligent enough to know the good detective story from the bad. Dorothy Sayers survives, and Berkeley is (hopefully) forgotten."
3,"Good book, great price, small font","The book ""Map projections a working manual"" is reprint of USGS publication under same name by MIT. The book and its contents are great and I am happy to have this book. The only thing that I am not happy with is the small fonts of the book contents. This small font size is the specific of MIT reprint and the original book printed by USGS is in normal and readable font size. I would be more satisfying if this problem was somehow mentioned in Amazon website so that I could decide knowingly if I want to pay for this product. Overall everything else about this product and its shipping/handling were perfect."
3,"Cool Game,... Could be better","Cool game, could be better,.. a lot like the others, XMen, Spiderman, and I am sure IRON MAN,.. Fly around, shoot and things. Not bad."
3,Good Game for the Kids,"Superman Returns is a good game for the kids because of it's relatively simple gameplay and repetitive objectives, but for that same reason it is also a bit of a bore for anyone over - oh let's say - 10 years old. If you want a game that you can play without paying too much attention to it, then go ahead and pick this up. It's worth the tiny price tag. But I would suggest spending your money elsewhere for a game with more long-term playability. :)"
2,Terrible!,"I rented this game for $5 and felt completely gipped, it was so awful. The only reason I gave it two stars was because of the graphics. The gameplay was so user UN-friendly, I gave up in frustration. Thank God I didn't buy it!"
2,Very Repetitive Only for Hardcore Superman fans,The game is a disappointment to say the least. The entire game consist of beating the same enemies to advance to the next chapter. Theres no real missions in this. No objectives other than beating up random enemies.Now if your a Superman fan you may enjoy playing as superman doing all these things with his powers. The powers are pretty fun but thats all there is.I dont think they depict his strength very well in the hand to hand combat either. He must throw cars at enemies to most of the times to kill them.I am a Superman fan so Its worth the 7 bucks i spent. I wouldnt buy it if i wasnt a hardcore fan. So I'm giving it a 2 not as a superman fan but just giving the game what i feel it deserves interms of quality overall for gamers in general.
4,Great set,"For the last two years I can't buy enough of these. They don't play with any other toys except matchbox cars but that to run over the ramps they make with these babies. A few pieces do break on occasion, but hold up pretty well under my crew's rowdy play. The plastic used by this brand is a little quicker to break than the old tinker toys, but you can't find those anymore. They do work with the old tinker toys too, but some connecting pieces are tighter than others"
2,It could have been an awesome toy,"At first the pieces were extremely hard to put together,even for an adult, which can be very dangerous because forcing them into each other can result in serious injury -such as poked eye.After a couple of months many of pieces became so loose that they are not unusable and others are still very tight.Sad - because my son likes them and likes to build.Poor quality control, cheap plastic resulting in poor fit.Also - much too expensive.I have not contacted the company but will try."
5,Good SOHO speaker phone,"Looked long and hard for a good 2-line SOHO speakerphone after experiences with Polycom 2201 (feedback & caller id incompatibility) and AT&T 962 (display freeze during caller waiting id). The AASTRA 9120 fit the bill and does not disappoint. Pros - compact, tilting backlit display, intuitive keypad operation, good speakerphone, programmable call forwarding active indicator, not over complicated. Cons - Inability to determine how to store or redial caller id numbers with a 1 in front."
3,Good Phone Not Great,"Received this phone last week. Upon inspection found it to be small and plain looking, no frills. Hook up was easy. Pretty much no set up needed, time and date automaticaly updated. After a few days of use, here are my pros and cons:Pros: Height adjustable LCD screenLighted LCD screenEasy to useSide Headphone jackCons: No speaker phone button - when using a headset, you can't switch to speaker phone unless you unplug your headphones.Caller ID for second line does not automaticaly show, you have to scroll over to view.To scroll through caller ID calls, you have to go through multiple button selections.When a second line call comes in there is a loud clicking noise in the speaker and the current call goes mute for a second. Can be anoying if your in the middle of a call."
4,essential ideas,some great ideas and also models in termos of relationship building in the professional service firms
2,Weird,"I remember some of 'Brother Dave' from the late 50's early 60's that was truly funny, this was OK but not what I was looking for time to keep looking. Brother Dave was a minister, with a twist this cut is a bit dated."
5,Great...,All I can say is this show is great.. That illiterate little kid down there (hilfan90210) wasn't even born yet when Ren & Stimpy were on the air.. GO PLAY ON DA FWEEWAY YOU LIL' BRAT!!!
3,The Last DVD(sort of),As we all know when Spumco got fired after only their second season a new company called Games took over and created the worst Ren and Stimps ever and was a mirror image of what Spumco did(in other words the animation went from good all the way to what it looked like in Stimpys Big Day)The thing I really would want to see is a ending to the first disk of Ren and Stimpy in the beginning but instead be called Ren and Stimpy In the End.But mabye they will do that in the next one coming out.
3,"Sizing was weird, but overall a fun costume","The sizing on this product was kind of weird. On my fairly average sized 4 year old, the main bodysuit part of the outfit was ultra small and the boots were huge. But overall, it's cute and fun for Halloween or as an addition to a dress-up chest."
4,Super cute!,"This is an adorable costume. My daughter is so excited. And it looks true to the picture. The only complaint I have is that the ""boots"" don't fit very well. We tried several different types of shoes until we found the right fit but it still wasn't as good as we wish it could be. But all in all it's a fun costume."
1,Sizes are out of whack; quality lacking,"First off, the costume arrived with a large snag down the front. Second, and more importantly for other customers, the sizes of the various parts of this costume are way out of whack. I have a 3 year old, and we ordered the 4-6T size. The headband is so small it would only fit around an infant's head comfortably. On the other hand, the boots were so big they wouldn't stay up on her legs. Quite honestly, this is the worst mail order clothing I've ever seen because of the size differentials between the different parts of the costume."
4,Redness Relief,"This product works for me. Each day I use Eucerin Redness Relief twice-a-day, and it keeps the redness to a low level. My daughter also has facial skin redness but cannot tolerate this Eucerin product, so it is not for everyone. Give it a try if many other things have failed."
4,It works,"This product works as it states. It will cover your redness but use sparingly. You can always apply more if needed. It's great for spot touch ups and men will be able to use this product as well. No fragrance! It's goes on easily, stays put and washes off with plain soap and water."
3,jeanne,irratated my skin when I used with foundation used alone it was fine though redness was still somewhat visible
3,ssmith,"This product is okay. I have rosacea and get pink in the cheeks. It is so aggravating! The lotion moisturizes well, goes on smooth, and does not irritate my skin. It does not do a great job reducing redness. I rinse my face in the morning, apply the moisturizer, and then apply a green tinted moisturizer over my cheeks. This helps but does not completely cover up my redness. I need either foundation and/ or a redness reducing powder to adequately cover my redness (at this point, I start to look pale, and need blush on my cheek bones, the struggles of having Irish skin!). I really like that this product has sunscreen and it really does do a good job moisturizing. Hope this is helpful!"
5,I like this cream,"I like this cream. I have alot of redness on my cheeks, I put this cream on before I apply makeup. Between my makeup and the cream - I don't see the redness."
1,worse then having red skin,"this stuff is garbage, it has a weird consistancy which is just the opposite of that, it spreads on your skin clumpily. If you have red skin that is peeling forget about using this, it will collect on the edges of whats peeling and leave a silver-ish green mess that looks terrible. Make sure you don't put more then a tiny dab on too, otherwise you'll look like the hulk (unless thats the look you're going for). worst product ever."
2,"Might reduce the redness, but left me unnaturally pale",I have rosacea and therefore had to try this product. I was pretty disappointed because it left my skin looking ghostly which required me to put on make-up afterwards. There are plenty of tinted mineral spf creams and even mineral make-up with sunscreen that I prefer to use because I only have to put on one product that covers the red with a more natural color.
5,Una Serie de Mini-Biografias,"Empieza desde su Papa, el abuelo, Walt Disney hasta Charlie Chaplin.Sin caer mucho en el detalle pero si un libro informativo y rico en el lenguaje como es muy conocido en la Sra Loaeza"
2,Where is the English Translation?,"The music is sung in Armenian and the CD contains the phonetic Armenian lyrics in the liner notes. I can't find any English translation other than the song titles. Without an English translation of the lyrics, this is pretty useless for the non-Armenian speaker hoping to learn a few simple words or phrases in Armenian."
3,so so,"Not a particualarly interesting or information packed video set.If you are a die hard historian of that era or particularly the civil war, then not much will dissuade you from getting it and you may learn something you didn't know. If you want to learn about the civil war in general and you aren't a scholar, stick to Ken Burns The Civil War."
2,definitely my least favorite so far,"After reading The Accidental Tourist, Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and Breathing Lessons, I began reading Anne Tyler's books in order. So far, Celestial Navigation was my least favorite. Usually I find her characters to be so true to life that they could be anyone and everyone, but I found Jeremy to be so odd that I couldn't relate to him at all. However, I did find myself rooting for him and wanted him to ""win"" in the end. I hope Searching for Caleb (next on my list) will be better!"
5,David Leadbetter 100% Golf: Unlocking Your True Golf Potential,"David Leadbetter explains the fundamental of golf in systematic way and easy to understand. And it works. I am craving to learn golf, and this book makes it become more interesting, and makes me feel to learn more about golf. I realize that in golf there are different level of skills, and we have to play according to our level, until we become a better player, then start to learn 'more advance' technique."
4,Rapid Fire Humor,"What many dont realize is that the FST guys did a ""Hemlock Stones"" play on radio that never made it to any record or CD. It was also called ""The Giant Rat of Sumatra"" but bears little resemblance to this. I like this one for the rapid-fire jokes. If you dont like one, the next one will get you. And the ineptitude of Stones being unable to figure out who the Electrician is is pretty funny. (They make it painfully obvious.) In some ways, their best, coherent, theatrical effort."
4,love to read,I loved this book it kept me wanting to read more. The characters were wonderful the story captavating. A must read.
3,darkness of the delta.,"like dolly parton and gloria estefan before her, cassandra wilson, with the release of her _belly of the sun_, has managed to breathe new life into an all but forgotten form of roots music. where her fellow divas muses were bluegrass (_the grass is blue_) and carribean (_alma caribena_), respectively, wilson has followed the blues, and followed them all the way down to the mississippi delta. dripping with peat moss and shadowed by willow trees, wilson's voice, breezy and fluid, drifts through a series of songs that recall stilted swampland oasises, clapboard juke joints on a sunday afternoon and even the abandoned train station and boxcar that served as her recording studio.this is definitely not the cassandra wilson that produced _blue skies_ but, at the same time, it's more cassandra wilson than we've ever seen. in a sense, this represents a musical homecomming for a prodigal daughter who hit it big in the big city and has come home to discover her roots and ours."
3,"tasteful, yes, but ultimately boring.....","It's hard to fault Cassandra Wilson's voice or her selection of songs (even though I question whether the world needs to hear another version of ""the Weight"") and the playing is very professional throughout...nice percussion, appropriate guitar. The whole thing reeks of ""appropriate"" I know that Wilson is a performer with her sites firmly fixed on the mainstream, but I can't shake the feeling when listening to her that she could do better than this that the real CW CD we've been dying to hear hasn't been released yet...that this woman has amazing performances in her that haven't been evoked yet.... She can sing. The band can play. Still, there's nothing really new here. Nothing to make us sit up in awe. It's dinner music... It's tasteful, but not a lot more.... Hard to criticize someone with such talent and be taken seriously, but this CD could have been so much better with just a few risks taken.... My ears are open. I'm waiting for the next one"
2,disappointing effort,"Wilson is a good (not great) singer with a great voice who needs to step back and reassess. i have no problem with the crossover approach...the flaws in this CD are 1) the song selection, which too often is uninspired/bizarre (e.g., The Weight is simply not a cover-able song--or she didn't figure out how to add anything; ditto Wichita Lineman), and 2) the sameness/lassitude of the singing and arrangements. Even when the songs she picks are inherently good or interesting (Waters of March, Dream in Rio, Shelter FTS), her overly laid-back treatments pale by comparison with the originals and even with other singers' covers.Compare this CD with Andy Bey's last two CD's--in which a similarly rich-voiced, subtle jazz singer makes a pop-oriented career move--and you will see what Wilson needs to do."
3,$25 for cast aluminum,"At full price, this brand of German cake pans offer excellent value compared to the slightly higherpriced Nordicware cast aluminum line. Brownies popped right out but the mold does not crisp the corners.Are these the true shape for canneles?"
1,"Froze up, waste of money. Could be just this USED disk sent to me.","That pretty much sums it up. I got a used disk and after a little time on the very first day, the program froze up. Could not get past it. Very disappointing, waste of money."
3,Ok for the price,"The microscope works well but the light did not last long. Replacing batteries did not correct the issue so I'm thinking the bulb blew or the connection is bad. Either way, it only lasted about 30 mins before the bulb stopped working. Everything else about this microscope is fine."
4,"Smart Little Instrument, Even if its Magnification Claims Are Overrated","The things I like most about this microscope are its portability, ease of use, and built in lamp. It's handy for indulging your curiosity to see what things look like up close.The scope claims a magnification of 60x-100x. As others have already noted, this is exaggerated. Being of a scientific mind. I decided to test the claim myself using calipers and a fine ruler. I compared the diameter of the true field of view versus the diameter of the magnified field of view. I obtained a magnification ratio closer to 30x-50x.If you want to use this scope to do research. Consider buying a computerized USB model with image, video, and time-lapse capture. (Orion MicroXplore PC200 Digital Handheld Scope)-But if you're looking for something to give your kids or grandkids, or take with you on a trek in the outdoors, I highly recommend this microscope to you."
3,Small talk,This little pocket microscope is a useful tool for identifying e.g. deer ticks and the like. It does not do microbes very well but none of the little ones do. It is pretty rugged and is useful to me in the field. Basically tells me whether I need to take a closer look with a better microscope that I cannot carry around with me.
4,Pretty good for the price,It is adequate and lets you see pretty clearly. I gave it 4 stars because its cheap but effective. It didn't get 5 because the focal point is actually between the clear plastic guard and the lens. The field of view is pretty narrow as well. The above reviewer hit it on the head though. Take the plastic guard off to see clearly.(easily snaps on and off) Doubt it goes to 100x zoom though.In the end I'd say this is good for the money but if you want quality you'll have to pay more for it. This is cheaply made.
3,Mini microscope,"It is a little hard to get samples under it and get a clear picture of what ur trying to examine. But with a little fanagleing, u can get a really nice view of ur specimen. It works well but, it is sometimes hard to get specimen in perfect position. U must be patient and u can get a clearview. It doesn't seem to be as strong a magnification as 100x but , it definatly over 60x. Its cheap enough.. So, if u don't want to spend big bucks, this is not bad alternative for you. Good luck, hope yhis helps you."
3,you get what you pay for,"It works...no question. It is exactly what you pay for however. VERY cheap magnification. A steady hand on a still target...If you want practical use, this may not be for you. Searching for things like spider mites I found VERY difficult. The magnification is actually too high for quickly scanning leafs....even on its lowest setting. IF you found something, the combination of steadying the plant as well as the scope was a pretty big job. If the target was not directly in the center of your field of view, it was severely out of focus, and the ""center"" was off to the top right of what is actually dead center of my scope.Kinda fun...has a few uses, but not practical for anything but amusement."
2,"very small, there are better choices.",when they say it fits in your shirt pocket they're not kidding. you could probably fit 3 of these in a shirt pocket. nothing about this tiny scope impressed me. average at best quality & optics. there are better lighted handhelds w/much better optics for around the same price.
4,Easy Music to Enjoy,"You don't buy this CD if you just want to rock. James Taylor has a mellow, insightful way of expressing his loves and life experiences. As with nearly all ""Best of"" CDs, one can argue over whether some really terrific songs were left out in favor those that are not quite so good. On balance, this is a pretty good collection of pleasant and enjoyable JT music that's easy to listen to."
2,We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver,"The story itself was interesting. This could have been a great book, if someone else wrote it. I admit that it's possible the author is a beautiful writer and I'm just not smart enough to get it. All the big words and complex sentences sounded to me like he was trying too hard to sound intelligent. It was very difficult to read and I'm not an uneducated person. I also didn't like how the story is told through letters that Kevin's mother is writing to her husband. I can't recommend this book to anyone. I much preferred ""Nineteen Minutes"" by Jodi Picoult."
3,Ambivalent,"I read the entire book, but I found it rather long and tedious in places. It's well written, but the main character (Kevin) did not ring true to me. The author got inside the head of her protagonist, (the mother) and this character did come alive.I was unsure about having the ending at the beginning -- it lessened the tension and took away from the story. Nevertheless I did like the ending she provided. Others have reviewed this book in depth,so I will conclude my review."
2,better then an ambien,The review of the movie sounded so good I decided to purchase the book. What a disappointment. DULL!!!!! Too much meandering. Takes too long to get to the jist of the story. Wouldn't recommend it
4,Haunting,"This is my first review. Please bear with me... Here's my short but honest feeling about good books - which I feel this surely was. Obviously, a compelling desire to keep reading; a bit sad when its over but mainly if I find myself thinking about it long after finishing. Pondering, reflecting. musing - the book haunts but in a delicious way.I've given this very good book four stars only because I felt one character had behaved far differently than the lead-up and this would pull me out of the book every so often. Her ability to put into words and lay bare such complicated human sentiments is truly a gift. This cannot be taught - she just has 'it'."
5,"a horror novel, with no horror","this book plays out like a horror novel, with the same slow build and gradual revelation of increasing atrocity - yet at the same time it feels utterly plausible.the narrator's voice is lucid and engaging, and the book ends on a note of truly moving revelation.second-person narration is really hard to do right, and this may be the best example of it that i've seen."
4,Imperfect but not untenable,You cannot deny that this novel is compelling. It may be self indulgent and bloodies its dead horses but the plot is gripping. There are no sympathetic characters in this novel and our Kevin is indulged in seemingly implausible ways. His father is particularly one dimensional and the author is distractingly obsessed with overweight and obesity. In fact she's more tolerant of mass murder than pudginess... pretty weird! But still a good read and heartbreaking tale.
3,Disturbing,"Oh my, what to say. What an amazing writer. What a story to tell, and how well told (altho sometimes the author does go on too long).BUT - why would anybody want to write a story like this? Who would want to live in that world for as long as she must have had to, to write it? Why does anyone voluntarily want to read a story like this? It was recommended to me by a friend and once started, it was like a car accident, it was hard to look away, so I did finish it. But I did not enjoy being in the world of that psychopath, Kevin. It was ugly, it was mean, it was horrifying. I wish I could forget I ever crossed paths with this book, but that will probably never happen.I've never been SO repulsed by a story, however that in itself is a testament to the talent of the writer. But I will never pick up another one of her books."
3,Thought-provoking and somewhat disturbing,"It is an interesting book to read; controversial subject and it brings up a lot of great discussion points. Would be a good book club choice. The author frames the story in a series of letters that the main character is writing to her ""estranged"" husband. What bothers me most, and it may seem petty but it drove me to distraction while trying to read this, is that the author seemed to have a thesaurus in front of her while she wrote and was challenging herself to use every big word in the darn thing. I can not imagine anyone using such language in writing letters to someone she knew so intimately. Even, and maybe even more so, if the purpose of the letter-writing was for self-given therapy after a tragic event."
2,Disturbing,"I found the format of letters to tell the story an unusual single perspective. The story itself is very bizarre. Even for a mystery reader this was difficult to finish. Initially, I kept asking myself where this story was going then when it went somewhere it was too disturbing to recommend."
4,Book Club Book - Better than I thought!,"This book looked like a serious downer. I had jokingly called the ""feel-bad book of the year"". But after the first 100 pages or so, I was really interested in what was going to hapen. And the end was a suprise although I might have seen it coming if I have thought about it. After I finished it - it really made me think about the characters. I pondered what it might be like to have a son like Kevin. He is not what he seems. Niether is she."
2,Very disappointing,"Overly long (who edited it?), pretenious (Eva's language/voice was more akin to that of a university english professor than that of a writer of budget travel guides), contrived, unrealistic and under-developed plot all led to me being very disappointed with this book which I am surprised won the Orange Prize for Fiction.The detailed descriptions of similar massacres were pointless and in my view sensationalist. The whole premise of the book was that Kevin was born evil and yet at no point in time did the book delve into an exploration or explanation of Kevin's psychiatric profile - which might have added more value and insight into the issue of school massacres.Eve was unlikeable and her cynicism and superior rants were hard to take. I struggled through to the end which was weak indeed."
2,Marmite - love it or hate it,"What is a potentially an incredibly interesting subject was done an injustice by Shriver's writing style. I found it to be self involved, pretentious and frankly hard work. The result of this is that it left me feeling completely disengaged with the characters.The first half of the book is like swimming through treacle but the second half goes on to redeem itself slightly as the plot picks up the pace.I persevered with this book as a friend highly recommended it, so as is clear from the division in the reviews placed here I would read a sample before committing to buying."
1,Book came damaged,"I bought this book brand new, to my dismay when I received the book, there was no protection around the book, mainly there was no plastic protection wrapped around the book to keep the pages from getting bent in shipping. The package was sent in a padded yellow envelope that was obviously just thrown around and the first 1/3 of the book was bent because there was no protection for the book.The book is great but I will never buy from this seller again because they obviously don't know how to ship a ""PAPERBACK"" book.I am an Amazon Prime member and would have hopes that my paid membership would be able to keep sellers from doing this."
2,Longest letter ever,"The title intrigued me I read the back of the book and the plot intrigued me more.On the third chapter and this women doesn't stop writing to her husband. I'm lost, I had to put it down and started reading another book.I hope the movie is better."
2,a disturbing book/not worth the reading time,"Our book Club just finished this book and the overall concensus was that it was a negative book about motherhood, family, kids and the United States. We felt that there may be people like Eva, Kevin, Franklin but it is unrealistic that they might be in the same family. It is our guess that the author never has had children. We tried to find a likeable character or one that could be admired and we came up with zero. Many people in our book club didn't finish the book, as they felt they could spend the time reading a more inspiring and interesting book."
5,Great book!,"This was one of the most frightening books I have ever read; scarier than the scariest Stephen King novel ( and I have read practically everything he has ever written). I could not put it down. It was ironic that I picked it up soon after the Chardon high school shootings, but the book is not so much about a school shooting as it is about the mother's life after the event. It is told entirely from her perspective, in a series of letters to her husband, whose whereabouts are only hinted at until the end. Very suspenseful, disturbing,yet compelling."
2,Difficult read,"The book is so ridiculously difficult to read it made me want to put it down within the first chapter.This book was so highly recommended by all my friends, not sure why!"
5,The construction and psychology of an artificial entity,"Once I received my copy of the book I could not put it down. It is a very well written and absorbing book. It will give you the knowledge and insight to design your own virtual entity.Besides being a manual for the creation of a virtual human, it is also takes a deep look into the psychology of the human face and body. You will learn more about your own psychology and increase your ability to read the body language of others, as well as being able to create your online alter-ego.Get a copy and enjoy reading it.Jerry MeislikWhitefish Montana"
1,Hack of an author,"The author is so pathetic that the only ""achievement"" in his career will be a sad attempt at cutting down a truly brilliant philosopher and writer."
5,Learning Fun,I used C is for China in my second grade class. We appreciated the authentic photography and interesting details. We also enjoyed talking about the text coming from a Chinese perspective. We really enjoyed the information about dragons and the abacus. A must have for a teaching unit about China.
1,Not For New Fans,"I consider myself a newer fan of ludo and this cd is not for me, but i am not you, listen to the previews if you like then buy, if you are unsure don't buy you wont be missing much and your life musically will not end, and don't pretend to be a die-hard fan by just buying it to have it.The C.D. is an earlier phase of ludo, not my taste but i liked the newer material so just beware its not the same and it might not be for you."
2,Romance novel,"Those hoping for a thoughtful fictional treatment of the Mountain Meadows Massacre had better look elsewhere. It should, however, appeal to the lonely-hearts evangelical Christian crowd. This author clearly has issues with Mormonism.This book sits firmly in the realm of the romance novel. Historical Fiction? That's a stretch in my mind."
1,Merelyn,The clasp did not work securely and the earrings fell off. I really was unhappy with the quality of the product.
2,Play FIFA World Cup 2006 ... by SQUINTING !!,"Now dont get me wrong. This game in itself is very good, but only if you play the PC Version. I dont know what has happened to EA, why they are making the palyers smaller and smaller and yet more smaller.When you are actually playing the game, the camera is so far back that you have to literally SQUINt your eyes to get a clear picture. This is pathetic. The core gameplay is good, but whats the fun if you need to sit glued to the TV.I had the PC version and liked it a lot. So thought of giving the PS2 version a try. I did the intelligent thing so as to go ahead and rent the title instead f buying it straightaway. And boy, did I make the correct decision.I am happy with my PC version of this game ( a good game, mind you).It's just that I am terribly dissapointed in EA for making the PS2 version so lame.Try it out for yourself and see what I am talking about."
4,Good Game!,Great shipping and great game! For a PS2 game it doesn't get much better. It's very easy to play once you figure out the keys and how sensitive each button push is to do each action.
5,Fabio Biondi's orchestral Vivaldi,"No matter how many recordings of Vivaldi's Four Season that you may have in your collection, you must have this four CD set. Not only is the Four Seasons included but also two CDs of various concerti and a CD of chamber music for violin and cello. Biondi is more fast and rustic in his interpretations than either Pinnick or Hogwood. There is a real glory to the sound of these recordings. Biondi gives you Vivaldi as he was played in the streets and concert halls of the Venice of his time. AWESOME!"
2,Epitomizes the Merman I DON'T Like,"As the title suggests, Merman does her best Katherine Hepburn impression on this strange recording. I wondered why it sounded like two voices when I popped it in the player and came here to read up on the history. They should've never released this if they didn't get her voice live. Aside from her none-too-subtle vocal acrobatics throughout, there are times where she sounds hoarse and needs a good cough to release some phlegm. The charm of a live recording is that it is live - which this is not. Her voice is not reacting to the audience adoration; she just barrels through the songs as if trying to catch a train. Some might like this but I'd rather hear her less annoying (read not stereotypically Merman) studio recordings."
5,Amazon- WOW!,"OMG again Amazon rules! Okay so my newphew is three years old. He loves to watch television (who doesn't) so I taught what better way to make his christmas a wonderful one by combining something I would love for him which is enhancing his reading and spelling ability and television (an asset he enjoys). This gift was loved by all and I loved it as well not only is it a great way to bond with your kids, but as a college student I barely had money to satifsy my needs this CHRISTMAS! The price was great, my newphew loves his gift- and so did his Mother. My goal here were to combine television and reading together- hence this great product. Hence Amazon"
3,Good Toy but expected more from Leap Frog,"Great concept but I expected more from Leap Frog. I expected the graphic and sound quality to be as good or better than all the previous DVDs but that is not the case. Extremely disapointed that none of my sons magnetic letters from the Word Wammer and Fridge Phonics don't work with this toy.In my opinion, it was important to hear the familiar voice of Professor Quigly. Maybe the next version will be improved."
4,Fascinating Intelligently Written Account,"I have wanted to read this book for years but always held off because I was sure it would be terrifying. While it does contain a large amount of scary aspects, the book is mostly a very well written, very intelligent examination of one man's experience with the unknown.Strieber's experiences with missing time, bizarre implants, and the now farmiliar Grey creatures are riveting and offputting at the same time. What makes this book really stand out from most of the ufoology is that Strieber really tries to figure out what the ""visitors"" as he calls them want with us. He comes up with several interesting theories, and the book is fresh and interesting throughout, never bogging down.I would highly recommend this read for the open minded and the curious."
5,Difficult and quite brilliant,"I didn't really know anything about Ornette Coleman before this cd. So when I heard it for the first time, especially the 17 minute ""First Take"", I thought I'd never get into it or understand it. It was hard at first. But now, after a few listens, I think it's great and amazing. Even ""First Take"", which at first seemed like nothing but noise with no formula or reason, has now come together for me. And I think that's the answer for people just discovering Coleman. At first you may not like or understand it. But if you like jazz, just hang in there and give it a chance. It will all come together eventually. The booklet includes photos and an essay on Ornette."
1,Watch out,"This picture is not what you will receive. I ordered this, and got movers 1/4 the size I expected. Then when I responded negatively, the vendor offered me a refund - whoopee, three whole dollars. Not worth the effort."
5,"The definitive German-English, English-German dictionary.","Out of a sea of options for German-English dictionaries, Langensheidt has always set the standard for clarity, breadth, and depth. This book should be the cornerstone of your German library. Excellent for college / high school students."
2,Not worth it,The hinges broke off after 4 months of purchase. I tried contacting Innopocket and have had no response. Not worth the $$$.
5,Perfect fit,"I was so eager to find a pattern that would look good in my room for my books, this has such a feeling of a library, is that weird? I once visited a castle in England where there was this amazing floor which I have never forgotten, and this so reminds me of that.. beautiful. I love amazon, you always find, exactly what you want."
5,great for our boat,bought thiese straps for docking my boat. these work great and i would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick way to dock your boat.
1,A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND GOOD MONEY,"IT SEEMS THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS VERY DRY AND ONE SIDED LOOK AT THE SAS HAS GOT A PERSONAL PROBLEM WITH THEM. INSTEAD OF JUST REPORTING THE FACTS, THE AUTHOR FINDS NOTHING BUT FAULT IN THE JOB THEY DO JUST LIKE AN ARMCHAIR QUARTERBACK ON MONDAY NIGHT. IT IS VERY APPARENT THAT THE AUTHOR JUST LOOKS AT THE SURFACE OF SOME OF THEIR MISSIONS, INSTEAD OF DOING MORE RESEARCH TO FIND THE REAL ANSWERS. IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY...$50.00 FOR THE HARDCOVER VERSION! THEN BUY THIS BOOK. I SENT MINE BACK."
1,"Badly designed product, incorrect user's manual","All I wanted was a backup drive for my laptop. Apparently, that's really difficult. This overly complicated drive required me to figure out how to read up on how to partition it and then never even gave me the option. Once I plugged it in, the Wizard comes up, I followed the directions, and then it went a head and partitioned itself... to a format called DFSB (or something), which is not what the manual said it should be (should be NSFB or something equally obvious.) So I promptly contacted Amazon returns. In this day and age, design this bad should make LaCie go out of business."
1,This is the worst product ever.,"This is the worst product that I bought ever. The FM signal level that wireless receiver can get is very very low and even if volume is set maximum, hard to hear. I'd strongly recommend not to buy!!"
4,Really Good,"I love these headphones, the bass in these headphones are booming. I like the built FM radio.....awesome. It's good to have if you already have a stereo and it's loud.....the music and the bass could of course bother others...but with these headphones you could be in your own little world relaxing without disturbing others. Great product!!!!!! I recommend people of all ages to get these. The only downside in my opinion would be that when listening to the radio it could be a bit hard to get a clear reception, but overall it's really good."
5,BEST DISPATCH EVER,"This cd is constantly in a cd player of some sorts for me, i play it in the car to school, i play it in my backpack during school, and i blast it in my house. This was by far the best concert i have ever attended and to have it all documented on cd and dvd is awesome!"
5,Perfect!,"This CD/DVD is awesome! The sound is crisp and the picture is clear! Although its missing ""Hey, Hey"" it's still a perfect treat for any music fan. DISPATCH ROCKS!"
4,Big dog loved this one too!,Met my expectations and loved seeing my big guy look like a quarterback! These plush ones work if your dog is not too destructive!
3,pleasant read,"This is a nice and cheap read with the usual mathematical puzzles thrown in in a readable fashion. However, I still contend The Money Game by Adam Smith is the first and best of this genre. Burton Malkiel's Random Walk Down Wall Street is also good.I guess the primary lesson to take from Paulos is that even smart guys like him can get caught up in the irrational exhuberance of the market place. But so too did Isaac Newton at the time of the South Sea. And that was a few hundred years ago.Bototm line: some interesting puzzles as to why we do not act rationally. Tversky's ground if you are into the theoretical. If you are into the practical just buy shares and hope for the best as Paulos did."
3,curious,"(I gave this book three stars only to be able to write this---I haven't read the book).The reviewer ""a reader from Chicago"" skewers Paulos for having ignored risk, and he deserves it if true. If you don't take risk into account properly, you don't understand trading---the real issue is how to do it properly, and that's a book in itself.Since RC has proven himself to be a tough audience (and I like that), I'd appreciate his view of the investment chapter in my book on decision making (Why Flip a Coin, Wiley, 1997, available in paperback)"
1,Avoid This Book,".Self-flagellating nonsense by someone who understands math, but not markets. (He bought WCOM @ 36 and then averaged down on the position, throwing good money after bad, for 3 more years!) In other words, a confessional by yet another clueless academic enamored of the MPT/Behavioral Finance crowd, but who lacks the market savvy or just plain common sense to make proper use of those theories (which address institutional-level concerns, but say little of relevance to individual investors.)Far better books are:Nassim Taleb, Fooled by Randomness: the Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and in Life.Justin Mamis, The Nature of Risk: Stock Market Survival & the Meaning of Life"
3,A Mathematician Gets Played by the Stock Market,"The book was a wordy resentment that the author had towards WCOM after losing money. I found only certain parts filled with any useful information, and unfortunately much of the math was beyond my scope of understanding."
3,crummy electrical system,"I just got this treadmill three days ago and finally had a chance to use it today. I was so excited! About twelve minutes into my workout, the computer completely stopped working. I changed the batteries and it worked for about five minutes then pooped out completely, leaving me with the inability to track my distance, calories, etc. Luckily the treadmill, being manual, still works, and it's probably not worth the cost to ship it back when I could by a pedometer instead. Still, I'm quite disappointed that a brand new product didn't work. If I have time, I may take the handlebars apart to see if any of the wires came disconnected. Hopefully I'll still get a good workout on this treadmill, but I guess you can't expect perfection for $129.00."
2,Treadmill,Not what I expected but it will do for now.I like the company.The assembly was a little rough despite following the directions.
1,Cory Everson Manual Treadmill,Not what I was hoping for. No incline adjustment makes this treadmill unfreindly at best and possibly dangerous. It seems to be well made but the design could be improved. I will most likely have to return this item - sorry about that.
2,its alright,"it's alright but if you are tall it won't work for you.you have to bend to hold on to the handles.the timer doesn't work,so you have to use your own time piece.it was easy to put together,it's easy to store you can store it any where."
5,excellent company,This treadmill is easy for me to move. It is quiet for TV watching. A hole in the shipping box resulted in a missing bolt. I wrote to the company and received the bolt in the mail within days of the request. Probably not good machine for jogging. The adjustable grade gives a good workout.
4,Repairing the digital monitor,"Picked up one of these used. The digital monitor was intermittent in it's operation.I found the problem to be in the sensor mounted to the frame at the bottom.It has a very small glass magnetic reed switch that was broken inside the black plastic case that is mounted to the frame.It is rather fragile and could break with enough shock to the treadmill.I took it off the treadmill, pried the plastic cover off, cleaned out the RV sealer and replaced the reed switch.I used a Coto Tech magnetic reed switch RI-07AA. The Mouser Electronics part number is 816-RI-07AA. The 07A should work ok as well.They are only a dollar or so. I bought a couple of them in case I break one.I suspect this is the problem most people are experiencing and it is an easy fix, just needs to be soldered in."
1,Not Reliable,"The first few days were great. Updated throughout the day, offered concise sports news, and updated scores. Then it just stopped and hasn't updated in over a week."
2,Poorly formatted baseball box scores,"I primarily downloaded this product for the baseball box scores, as The Boston Globe does not include box scores in the kindle edition. AP Sports includes the box scores, but the formatting is so poor, it is quite difficult to parse them. It looks like someone took an automatic format translation program, and didn't spend any time formatting it to get the right results. Disappointing."
2,Disappointing.,"I bought this CD after having seen Ken Burns' special on PBS. The energy that came through on screen in the Benny Goodman segments doesn't really come through in this CD. Artie Shaw said that Benny Goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability. That shows in this collection. Afterall, where would Jazz be if Jazz musicians didn't take risks."
3,Overcharged shipping !!!,I believe the product itself is good. BUT !!! The seller charged me with $6.13 for the shipping. The post office charged them only $2.31 so where's the extra $3.82 went to ???
2,Meissen: Collector's Catalogue,"I agree with another reviewer and was disappointed by the book. There is very little information about marks, periods, maker's marks (no pictures at all) and ninety percent of the photos of Meissen ware are in black and white and are not of the best quality. It definitely isn't a collector's catalogue as most of the pieces are unavailable to the public (unless they have a lot of money). As a new collector it did not help me at all. There is a book by Jim and Susan Harran called ""Meissen Porcelain Identification and Value Guide"" which has amazing photos and gives far greater detail on the products, the background, the marks (and forgery's) of this fascinating maker of porcelain."
1,review,This was not what I thought it would be. It was disappointing...not many activities or printable items. This is not a helpful resoruce. Don't waste your money. There was nothing wrong with the service but the product wasn't as helpful as the description made it out to be.
5,THE Quintessential Course,"I have bought every one of Ted Green's books and records as soon they came out. These books remain my lifelong reference on the subject. I remember my Classical Guitar teacher in College, who was a student of Andres Segovia, and not at all inclined towards jazz guitar telling me after I lent him a Ted Green album that; ""...this is the only Electric guitarist I have ever found that has truly inspired me"" Such was the genius of his technique and understanding of the instrument. Undeniable! There is a reason for that. All of Ted's books will give you the perspective of method that will carry you through a lifetime. All his books are masterpieces for the perenial student of jazz guitar. Through his books, Ted will always be with us sharing his genius. (Chord Chemistry is also highly recomended.)"
3,Avergae,"I was looking forward to this book based on the reviews, but I was disappointed. Though the book seems to include all of Vermeer's work, it does so in a very scattered fashion, mixed with other artists' works, furthermore, obliterated by them, with the full list of works sorely missing. Paralells to similar works by other artists can be very useful if done correctly, but I found the comparisons in this book to be distracting, confusing and even annoying. The full images of paintings and their details are often separated, and I had to go back and forth between several pages when trying to examine one painting. The text is dry, poorly edited, with too much information and not enough insight. Not deserving of the high rating it got."
3,Excruciatingly Slow,"In contrast with the reviewer who wrote, ""If you are at all interested in art, or have any intrigue with Italy, you'll find this book completely captivating,"" I had the complete opposite reaction to ""The Day Laid on the Altar."" I love fiction set in the world of art and artists, especially those set in Italy. Venice is my absolutely favorite city in the world. Nevertheless, I could barely make myself finish this book. The prose is beautiful and poetic, but that is not enough to propel a novel, even a very short novel such as this one (barely 200 pages). There is little to no plot. The section on Titian made me want to put down the book and find a non-fiction work about Titian and his family. However, as this was Bernardi's first work, I plan to try another book by her. Just not right away."
2,raisin,"i am disappointed in these vynil balls, they prune and mis-shape with temperature changes, and become difficult to handle,"
2,"porn, with emotions","I'm not entirely sure why many of the reviews are raving about the image quality. What were the reviewers expecting? Poorly compressed JPEGs printed from a home printer?Listen, there's really thing spectular about this. If you're a fan of Suicidegirls, you'll love this. If you're not, you might still love this. It depends on whether or not you like goth/punk-looking girls, in the nude. If you don't like this, don't get it expecting some fine photographic works. This really is just photos of hot girls. Oh wait, I meant hot girls with feelings."
5,gotta love the sg girls,i stumbled into the sg website and am loving it. if you only buy one book a year. this should be it. if you have already bought a book this year try returning it claim somebody has already read and exchange it for the sg book. you wont regret it. and join the website too. you'll only kick yourself later if you wait
2,"A few gorgeous girls, a whole lotta ugly ones.","I'm sorry, but it's true. While I've always dug girls with tattoos, most of the girls in this book take it way too far, and a large percentage of them sport what I consider to be the worst thing to ever happen to the female body - pierced nipples. More power to you if that's your thing, but I find them absolutely disgusting. This book does more to incite anger in me than any kind of stimulation (physical OR mental), as many of the girls in this book are obviously naturally beautiful, but have tainted that with unfortunately placed tattoos, ridiculous piercings, and some of the most asinine hairstyles I've ever seen outside of a French circus. And, of course, some of the girls are just plain disgusting no matter what they put on (or take off) their bodies. Unless you are turned on by girls who look like they were assaulted with a nail gun, don't waste your money."
2,I dunno.......,"To each their own,""beauty in the eye of the beholder"", & all that.I find this a bit of a yawn - funny how all this leather/tats/piercings/etc seems to symbolize having a ""free mind"" nowadays.You see this all the time now,these daring ""non-conformists"" conforming to the hipster wannabe Ideal.Seems so uninspired and well,boring.Again,to each their own....."
2,Great picture... but bad quality.,The picture is great but the poster I received was a really bad copy. it looked like a bad print. it looks good just from far.
3,Just okay,"It lasted 2 weeks but I don't really know if it was enough food. I had one fish die out of 8 fish in a 20 gal tank. Also, there was a powdery film on all of my plants and structures. It did keep my fish alive (the one could have died of anything so I wont blame it on the food block) but I dont know if I will be using this again."
4,Satisfied with the product. I have 3 big gold fish in my 30 Gallon tan After 2 weeks of vacation the fish are alive and healthy,I have 3 big gold fish in my 30 Gallon tank and After 2 weeks of vacation the fish are alive and healthy. No cloudy water though I have a filter and pump attached to the tank. I will recommend the product to anyone with a similar set up.
4,interesting,"Herbie Hancock can Be Genius&then all over the place.He is a Great Musical Talent but some things have left me puzzled.if you are new to His work this is a cool place to begin&understand what has made Him the Artist that He is.you get His straight ahead style from the 60's then His Funk Inspired 70's style,The 80's Pop&Hip-Hop.all that combined in the 90's.some things work some don't.i have collected many of His records over the years&you feel many different vibes from Him.this is a good overview to a very important musical career."
3,Great if you have cable ...,"This sounds like a great idea, but it's not workable if you connect via a dial-up modem. The scenes don't change unless you're online, see. So thanks for a great idea, but maybe I'll keep looking."
2,A good book - now seriously out-dated,"This rests an excellent basic book for those starting on their quest and has much good advice. It is also well written and easy to follow.HOWEVER, it was written before most of the key Scottish documents (e.g. births, marriages, deaths, wills etc) became available for search on the internet. So it misses the new power of computer based research on these scottish document sites and advice on how best to do this. It also shows its pre-computer age in many other aspects.No longer a good buy - unless you don't use a computer ."
5,Very Interesting DVD,"I saw this DVD set on Scotland on TV website. It was broken up in smaller parts. Having the entire series together is much easier to enjoy. Craig looks so very young, but he wrote and starred in this series and IF you like ancient history you will certainly enjoy this set of DVDs. It is worth the price and very good."
4,Frank Rosolino,"More of a `fun` album for Frank, and all muted trombone solos, but still worth having if you`re into him as I am."
5,Good starter set for jazz beginners,"This is a beautifully packaged 5 disc set highlighting some of the greatest jazz artists of all time. If you buy this set and are really excited about the sound and the masterful artists presented then, I highly recommend collecting the 22 discs of individual artists by Burns which showcase the popular and influential music of those artists. Having all of the Ken Burns Jazz editions is of course just a start but a good start into the world of jazz it will be."
2,Maybe Ken's mom was a jazz fan....?,"I admit that I've watched and enjoyed some of this set. However, it is terribly nostagic and fails to emphasize the true significance of any of the artists. I question how much Ken Burn's even likes jazz...Most notably, though I am not a huge fan myself, Duke Ellington should have been pedistaled to the same heights that Mozart, Bach, Ravi Shankar or The Beatles typically are.Similarly, the films failed to recognize much of the social and philosophical significance of the music so commonly discussed by the artists themselves.In the end (which comes a lot sooner than expected), if you exclude the last couple of discs and call the film Jazz: The Early Years I'd probably recommend it. Unfortunately, it was kind of like a history of Western European music that fails to mention anything past Beethoven."
4,Revisionist History,"This boxed set is a ""must have"" for every collector, because of its wonderful sound. It seems to me that engineers transferred these classic recordings to disk in a way that gives them more clarity and definition. That being said, as other reviewers have noted, much of the collection is not representative.Understandably, there is too much Ellington. Burns is a filmmaker not historian, obsessed with Ellington, who, like himself, was a better empressario than musician. Ellington hired and co-opted the ideas of outstanding musicians, composers, orchestrators, and arrangers.I am disappointed that the Goodman rendition of Sing, Sing, Sing is not the widely-hailed best ""jazz record of all time"" 1938 Carnegie Hall Concert version.For jazz aficionados like myself, these are quibbles. And kudos for Burns, who undertook such a media project and produced this affordably-priced boxed set that may even bring jazz back into the consciousness of mainstream America."
2,THE HISTORY OF LOUIS ARMSTRONG,"As a history of jazz, it is hardly comprehensive. Mr. Burns seems obsessed with Louis Armstrong; even when dscussing the bop era, Armtrong pops up again. Also, as one commentator has pointed out below, for Burns jazz=black. Most great white jazz players are given short shrift with exceptions for Benny Godman and Tommy Dorsey, and of all people, Ted Heath. The Herman-Kenton era is brushed aside with a sentence and many great white trumpet players aren't even methioned such as Ziggy Elman, Sonny Berman, Bill Chase, etc. What about trombonists Bill Harris, J.J. Johnson and Kai Windig?The claim made by one that jazz is strictly an Afro-American music form is nonsense at least by today's standards."
5,wow,"These tweaters sound amazing in my custom made speeakers. i used an old optimus t-1000 speaker box. updated the woofers with a pair of 15 inch sony subs, sony 6 1/4 inch mids and these tweeters. Absoultly amazin sound!!!!!"
1,Learn in Your Car Spanish,The sound quality of the tapes made them too hard to understand; as if it were taped over many times. There were too many voices in the background making it impossible to follow any one in particular.
4,Cute and Durable,I have to say I was surprised by the durability of this costume. I was expecting a much cheaper version. The material has a faux leather feel to it and looks great. It looks great on my two year old and it fits her great. I would say that if your child is a 4T then this costume may be too small for her. I just can't see it fitting a 4T child. It fits my 2T wearing daughter great and I feel it would look fine for a 3T as well. The mask is surprisingly more durable than I thought it would be and it fits her well. It has a tendency to slip down but that is also due to my child playing with it often. All in all it's a great costume and my daughter loves it.
4,Better than I expected.,"My granddaughter is 3 years old so I wasn't sure how a 2T-4T would fit. It was a perfect fit, even over her warming layers, which included long sleeved shirt and tights. She and I were very happy she could fulfill her dream of being Batgirl! for Halloween this year."
5,"Perfect for Teeny, Unsteady Hands","I got these for my friend's 2 year old. She loves coloring, and these fit into her tiny hands perfectly. I don't have first-hand experience with them being especially washable, but I think it's a great product."
3,"Very washable, very breakable","I guess there are always trade-offs in life, because although these crayons are extremely easy to wash off of almost any surface, they also break apart after only one or two uses. I now have washable PIECES of crayon, rather than washable crayons. They still do the job, and I still steer my 2 year old to use these pieces instead of her other coloring devices, but she has clued into the fact that broken crayons are less fun (and much harder) to draw with. Unfortunately, the pieces mostly sit unused in her drawer."
1,Didn't work for me,"After a month of double dosage as recommended, no relief from ringing and buzzing at all.Yet I'm so desperate that I might give it another month for another $30!I recommend the American Tinnitis Association's website at ata.org"
5,RingStop,"It was shipped qickley and was in the condistion (New) as discribed. I was hoping that this product would work for my inging, but it didn't and I had to go back into my doctor for help."
1,Ringstop - snakeoil,"I now have suffered with a very mild form of tinnitus for 2 years. Its in the form of a very feint very high pitched almost of the scale whistle in my head, which is present 24/7. 3 months after it started I bought more than the reccommnded amount (4 bottles) and followed the instructions on taking them. There was ZERO reduction in the tinnitus, no effect on it was heard at any time. I can find no independant proof such things work and i believe the previous review thats says ringstop works is probably from someone associated with the manufacturers or a retailer of it. Do not waste your money on this or other snakeoil ""remedies"". You will have more chance of getting a tinnitus cure for your money by donating it to someone who is there to help you, not con you. Someone such as the American Tinnitus Association or the British Tinnitus Association. I'd give this item zero stars but the dropdown list does not give me that option!"
3,"works okay, not super sharp, and it's BIG","If you don't want to worry about hurting yourself shredding cheese and you have plenty of drawer space then this is for you. It does fit in the dishwasher nicely, it's solid, the rubber bumpers are nice. We're still using it but I'm looking for something better."
4,THE LORD IS MOVING IN INDIA,"With a price under a dollar, how can we not like this book? All you bargain hunters should be excited with book about how the Lord is moving in a denominational church in the Eastern hemistphere. Better than a deal on a cellphone."
5,Good movie,I bought this movie for my 6 year old because she is totally obsessed with the whole Beverly Hills Chihuahua franchise. She seemed to like it. :)
1,Horrible,"We tried watching this movie for a family film night. Everyone agreed that it was 1 of the worst on a management to the movies we have ever seen. I like kids movies most of the time, but I have no idea how this film got such good reviews. It was awful."
4,I Love those Chihuahuas,"I watched this with my dog. He loved it too.I'm not much for Children's movies, but I like dogs and so took a chance. If you want something light and fun, this is the ticket."
3,My son loves this mobile... when it's not stuck.,"My son is 9 weeks old and he loves looking at this mobile when he is in the crib. It's cute and colorful. However, he screams his lungs out when the mobile is stuck. I think that's the only flaw. The arm is just a little too short so that one of the characters get stuck by the arm of the mobile."
2,"Couple of good songs, disappointing","I love ""I'll tell me ma"", but unfortunately it was the only really good track on this CD. Most of the others are treacly versions of songs that have been done better before. If you love the Pogues, the Chieftains, and so on, most of the tracks on this album will make you shudder."
1,JUNK,"The single CD isn't worth the postage. It simply is a worthless effort. In a word, JUNK that is not recommended. You can get more for free online."
5,Understanding Presence,"Many times I would hear sr management talking about having presence, I knew I had it when leading meetings or presentations but thought some extra reading on the subject would be great. This book was wonderful, easy to ready, and provided a lot of guidance."
5,The best *KOMPAKT compilation,"First of all; I can't believe nobody has reviewed this item before, second; I wouldn't give 5 stars to anything I like, I'm giving 5 stars because this double album is simply perfect. If you're reading this I assume you know the ""kompakt sound"" so I won't waste my time describing it. I""ll just tell you that this is, in my opinion, the best Kompakt compilation ever, I own all of the ""Total"" series, aswell as Kompakt 100, kompakt Pop Ambient, etc.. and many solo releases. And this group of 12 inches singles compilated between end of 2004 and part of 2005 is the best I've heard. Not as ""minimal"" as the first records by this label, and a lot more funky. Hypnotic beats, eerie sounds, and angelic pads are all over the tracks. A perfect record for home listening (i don't know why but I'd recommend it for sunday afternoon, specially if it's raining). I'm not a DJ, just a music lover, and I write as that, but trust me, these songs would work pretty well in a dancefloor too."
1,Poor batter y design,"When it works, it's great. The problem is that almost every time I use it, I have to remove the two batteries, reinsert them and reinsert the battery cover. After I use it once or twice, it stops working until I repeat the above maneuver. I am not sure if it is a problem with the battery compartment design, or perhaps I am ""resetting"" the device by removing and reinserting the batteries.I tried calling tech support for assistance, but as usual, leaving a message resulted in no reply.I think Hawkings is a high quality company, and I don't understand why they don't want to give better support to this product. Until this is fixed, it is so annoying that I strongly recommend not purchasing it at this time."
1,Don't bother exchanging for another,"Just get your money back.I'm not exactly sure what the company was thinking when they put this product out on the market. They might as well just put a toy flip phone out and call it a ""WiFi"" detector instead this junky thing.Outstanding problems:1. 20 tries (or 20 hands) and you'll finally get both batteries in.2. The flip-top part does not stay shut, even in a world where flip-top technology has finally been mastered. My shampoo bottle has dispenser has a better mechanism than this.3. The power light flickers, giving you that warm feeling that it's 'sort of' working.4. It stops working when you carry it around with you, defeating the whole purpose of 'portability.'"
1,illiterate,"Despite having the title and presumably the tax-payer funded salary of a professor, this person cannot write English. When an intelligible sentence occasionally emerges, it turns out upon examination to be a cliche or a tautology. A disgraceful waste of trees and time."
3,"Jack of all trades, master of none","I found that this book tries to cover really lot of things. It could be a good coverage (actually, it's not bad) but when I finished reading it, I didn't get much of it, except from it's good pictures.Perhaps, it should take a more local look, not that global."
4,A good book if you like other Klutz titles,"Like the other Klutz books, Birthday Parties for Birthday Girls is written with an eye toward children doing things for themselves. There are plenty of fun activities (although some can be messy). Your basic preteen girl will be enthralled and will start planning her party eleven months in advance. The ideas work for ""last day of school"" parties, ""halfway to Halloween"" parties and ""the boy I like looked in my general direction"" parties just as well as a boring old birthday party. My favorite girl loved it, as do my four preteen nieces."
1,11-inch...Really?,"First order was returned without my knowledge and instead of getting the full price return, all I got was $0.38...second order came in at 4-inch...wouldn't use this company again."
4,confused by size,"You mentioned that it was an 11"" strainer. Maybe I misunderstood. I was thinking diameter (edge to edge), obviously you were talking length. Anyway, It is a nice strainer not quite as big as I thought it would be but useful nonetheless. Well constructed."
3,strainer,I thought it would be bigger so instead of sending it back it will work for now I like the meatl
3,Tony Hawk Review,"This book, Tony Hawk: Professional Skateboarder, in my oppinion, was a fun book to take away your boredom.This auto-biography summarizes Tony's life from when he was a hyper adventerous toddler to when he retired from his carrer and had a family. This book wasn't for those looking for a complex, involved biography; this was to the point, adding in points that would easily amuse people and adding in tidbits of information that you wouldnt find in your everyday book. This is a good book for those looking for a short simple read, and I wouldn't mind reading this book more that once.bennett"
4,Something we all need to know,Very interesting history of Auschwitz and the surrounding area. After visiting there it was great to learn more. Would recommend this for anyone interested.
2,"Ok book, flawed LIQ self assessment","While this book starts with an intriguing premise, that of some sort of leadership IQ, it ultimately fails in defining such a nebulous quantity. In particular the self-assessment questions are ridiculously contained with situations that do not apply to what in essence true leadership encompasses. Perhaps it is generational in nature, and of a bidding oratory much in common with the consultant's point of view. Do not take serious this text in the 21st century, especially in consideration of the Silicon Valley measure of leadership, which defies this sort of measurement altogether!"
5,WONDERFUL!,WHAT A BLAST! A TOTALLY WONDERFUL AND LOVELY CD OF EXTRAORDINARILY SPIRITED AND INTERRESTING MUSIC. BEAUTIFULLY RECORDED. THIS IS THE BEST!
1,Alter Ego,What the hell did Solzhenitsyn know about Lenin in Zurich? He was too narrow-minded to perceive the intelligence of the man and too neurotic to learn the history of the city back to the beginning of the last century. In his works the writer enherited Dostoevsky's exaggerated sado-masochism but with no philosophical or psychological background though. Lenin's futuristic and highly humane ideas were definitely out of his grasp... I'd better look for another author.
1,KRUPPS Electric Kettle,I really love this kettle but the reliability is horrible. This is the third one I had. It broke 5 weeks past the 1 year warranty. First broke under warranty and second just past the warranty.
3,Excellent teakettle except for the switch,I had this tea kettle for about 18 months. It worked perfectly until the switch went out. There must be a defect in the design of the switch because it just stopped working all together.
5,worth every penny,"Modestly priced, but works great, looks better. Lightweight, quiet, and boils water quickly. A great product."
2,kettle leaks at base of handle,"I really would like to praise this kettle - it fits nicely on the base, holds a lot of water, is attractive and heats quickly. The problem is that, after a few months of use, it has started leaking at the base of the handle, leaving a puddle of water around the circular electrical base of the unit. This identical problem happened to a previous identical model I'd bought and used for several years, and I liked it enough to try it a second time. I'm now sending it out for repair or replacement under warranty, and I'll report back on whether they were responsive to this request. I don't drop or abuse the kettle, and the fact that this identical flaw has appeared in two kettles in a row makes me think that it is a design flaw. It would be nice if there were a simple fix such as tightening a screw against a gasket, but I can't find one. A pity."
2,cold water stays cold!!,"We have used a Krups toaster for years with no problem--- however ,the kettle was a different kettle of fish--------------- a complete failure !On arrival in November , we unpacked the item , read the instructions and prepared to boil the water. Surprisingly , the kettle would not stay on .Called the Krups service center and was advised to ship it back for repair. While repacking a black plain cardoard disc on base plate came loose -- so retried boiling without and ""Eureka"" it worked. Called service again-- to tell them all was O. k.(There is no indication that the disc is not part of the unit)Three days later - kettle failed completely , recalled service center again, told to ship unit back to Amazon. I was not impressed by the krups service people - somewhat off hand and diffidentNet Net, only Amazon came out well -- easy to return and prompt refund ,- well done Amazon!!What a Hassle with krups!"
1,Broke within first 5 minutes,"OK first offonce you've assembled it you can't take it apart again. I got through maybe 6 reps and heard a ""snap"" sound. One of the tension bands popped off the track and then the entire compartment where the other tension bands are came apart somehow. I can't even try to repair it myself. I had the thing for five minutes. It's a waste of money even for 14.99. don't waste your money on this piece of crap. stick to the old fashioned crunches at least you know it won't break and it's free."
2,Didn't Work,"Like the previous reviewer, I prefer the Bibsters to these. My daughter is 22 months old, average size, but the neck opening was too small for her. Also, the sticky closure got caught in her hair. Thin, flimsy material, but there is a pocket, and the back of the bib is lined in a waterproof-looking liner."
2,American (China) Lawn mower,"I bought one of these and two of the reels would not engauge the cutting bar as they should. Left patches of grass all over.Took it back and bought a Scott's Classic 20"" reel mower. Twice the price, but its made in America and the quality is there."
4,Good Listening,"I needed a radio with an AM band because I like to listen to ""talk radio"".This radio fills the need very well and I appreciate that."
3,This was nice......there is a fifth one right?,"Before I started reading this book I had the impression that It would sum up all of the incidents and all the drama leading up to it. But, I was greatly disappointed. When the book ended I was thinking, did the real ending of the book fall out? Then I turned to page and saw the epilogue, so I thought, ""Okay this should sum things up for me."" But, It didn't. All it did was to leave me hanging on a string, and wondering if I misread something about a fifth book. I suggest that you don't read it unless you have prepared yourself for dissatisfation. But really, Is a fifth book coming out? Cause if it is, I'll change my review around completely."
2,Werner-- Where Did You Go?,"Werner Herzog must have really fallen on hard time$$ and thin dime$$ to have become a part of this ""Mockumentary."" Comparable to Orson Welles making a zombie vid for MTV with an aging Michael Jackson. What? No projects out there for this icon? Sad."
3,Clever,"Clever mockumentary by Zak Penn and featuring director-legend Werner Herzog on his quest to make a true documentary about the human need to believe in myth. It takes off as your standard ""making of"" fare, but then it twists into something entirely different as Zak Penn begins filming a super model and the ship encounters what appears to be the real loch ness monster. A number of the crew members are humorous and provide some good material, such as Michael Karnow as the Crypto-Zoologist who is convinced that nesse is the real deal from the get go, and Werner Herzog is in excellent form as he imitates his own obsessed megalomaniac self. The film definitely caught me off guard the first time I saw it, the fakery didn't become apparent until the plot became especially perpostrous as Penn pulls a gun on Werner, forcing him to film an idiotic model of nesse. However, it came across as a tad gimmicky the second time around."
1,"An inferior copy of Joel Rosenberg's ""Not For Glory""","When I picked this up, I was in the mood for some fun, if a little shallow, military science-fiction (my Honor Harrington fix). I got the latter, but not the former. The story progressed at a sluggish pace and the hero didn't really show any attributes that made me care whether he survived or not. But what really bugged me was the feeling that everything was just a little too familiar. In 1988, Joel Rosenberg wrote ""Not For Glory"" about the Metzadans, futuristic neo-Israelis whose poor planet's only viable export is mercenaries. The structure and 'feel' of the Metzadans was very similar to the dirigents, but also backed up by a good story. Too bad it's out of print."
4,Yellowcard Rules,"I have just recently purchased this cd and I was shocked at how great yellowcard really is. I downloaded a few songs in the past to get a good feel for them. I was just blown away after getting this EP. The song avondale reminds me of the harshness of Taking Back Sunday meets the catchiness of Saves the Day. I get chills listening to this song. The words ""... real life ain't no fairy tale. I just thought you should know."" reminds me of how my life is like right now."
3,"Fun, but not deep","This novel was a fun little romp, especially for those who have at least a basic understanding of Shakespeare's plays. I'm not sure the end of the Jessie Kaplan plot was well explained or reasoned out, it felt too sudden (I can't give more detail for risk of ruining the plot).My main criticism is that Cohen, while desciribing the Bar/Bat Mitzvah culture of East Coast Jews (Midwest and south is a bit more reserved), missed an opportunity to make a sharper critique of the situation in which the ceremony is downplayed and the party is the main event. Certainly Cohen issued a critique of this culutre, but it is weak at best and with a bit more humor and even exaggeration she could have made a point more forcefully. The main charachter, Carla, seems downright uninterested in the ceremony, except for the speech, for most of the book.Good poolside reading. YOu won't gain any deep insights into the human condition. I hope that Cohen wasn't trying for that, or she missed badly."
2,Okay Read,"This book was okay It needed more detail maybe because she wrote it when she was young that could be the reason it was written so poor, so I'm going to give her the benefit of doubt I brought part two so i can see if her skills matured."
4,Interesting,The book was really a teaser not knowing which way it was going to go so it had a lot of thrills and some chills in it. Good book!!! Keep up the good work.
3,"Dry, but thorough","This is a well written, thorough book, but is a dry read. It is more of a resource for those that need a reference or options. I was looking for something on how to write a good cookbook or do food writing, not a reference book on how to write about the mechanics, abbrevations, and whether to put a 'the' in a sentence. When I get to that level, this book will be more useful."
2,At least it is inexpensive,"Left my wall charger in a hotel, and wanted a car charger, too. After a few months, the car charger failed. However, the wall charger stills works, kinda sorta. Another reviewer suggests that this charger may be the reason I get poor battery performance with my LG phone. Interesting theory, might be true. At the price point, I can afford to have one at desk side, one at bedside. Would get a better review if the car charger still worked, as I would be less afraid to use my phone's GPS, which runs down batteries very quickly."
5,Once More,"I only had the opportunity to browse around this book. However, I imediately realized that this one was worth reading calmly. Once more Fayman explains this generally abstract subject with his grace and knowledge, making it easier to digest the material. If you have read any of Fayman's book, you know his ways of explaining things are just superb. So, without further explanations, this book it is worth every penny, it worked for me, a Physics student, and it will work for anyone who's interested in this matter."
3,Okay... minus the errors,"The book was an okay read. The storyline was enjoyable, however, there were so many errors that it became a bit confusing and annoying at times. For example, there was the switch from first person to third person during Rachelle's story and there was also the name confusion of the wife. Other than the errors, I found it to be a simple and enjoyable read."
4,you'll be hooked,"From the middle to the end of the book, i couldn't sit the book down. i read it in two days. you'll love how Leslie handles the relatives during Thanksgiving when she brings her older boyfriend to the house. At first i thought Leslie was a little too tough, but that's the type of woman that it would take to handle the complex situation of infidelity. I'm looking forward to your next book, Hayes."
4,A very interesting book,"Good book, is teaching something new to me, I am please with the delivery time.thank you"
5,you will not soon forget this movie,this is a beautiful movie with a powerful theme of morality.The sound track adds to the power and should be sold separately...so far I haven't found it. If you want to have some food for the mind and add some shades to the spectrum of grays see this movie.
2,I am the odd man out with this,"I bought this book to read with two of my friends, one a big Chuck Palahniuk fan. Seeing that Mr. Plalhniuk liked it, I figured it had a 50/50 chance of my liking it (like C.P.'s books)I got maybe 40 pages into it, and i just kind of fizzed out. The writing style he uses is a poor rendition of C.P.'s, which is probably why he liked the book so much... it's his protege. But not in a good way.I got disinterested very quickly, as i did with _Diary_ & _Invisible Monsters_. I can't get in to this book at all.But I'd still reccomend it as a library check-out, and if he ever writes another; that's where'd i go."
3,Beware: Does Not Fit Creative Zen Micro,Looks like a well made product however my MP3 player (a Creative Zen Micro) could not fit in the opening and the armband had to be returned.
4,well liked,"I recieved the fountain on time and everyone was amaized at it,I will be using it often in our church"
3,Good Music....Lousy Lyrics,"I purchased the album because the music was interesting and quirky, but you could still tap your feet (or whatever else) along with the tune. While I still like the album for the same reasons, I'm less happier with it now that I know what the artist is actually saying. It's not that the lyrics are particularly crude, instead its that they only rarely make any sense. The lyrics are not about a story, nor are they about a feeling or common experience, instead they are somebodies musings thrown out a random and sung along to the background music."
4,Not So Modest Mouse,"In an attempt to follow up their masterpiece the Moon and Antarctica, Issac Brock and Modest Mouse released Good News... ALthough a catchy album, it lacks that certain ""i dont know what"" that made the Moon album so great. in fact it may just be that Modest Mouse has gone too pop and let go of their indie rock roots. Nevertheless it is a worth album for 4 stars and it would be recommended highly."
3,REAL fan has his rant...,"A lot of people claim to be Modest Mouse fans even though they have only heard Good News or first heard float on. Even people I tried to get hooked a few years back who said they were no good are running out to buy the cds. Good News isn't their best, it is far from it. I own every CD and every LP, and this has to be the lowest of their work. I had good hopes for Good News, I managed to get a signed copy (signed by the entire band...the new band shall I say, not the same as it used to be). I still love Long Drive, Lonesome Crowded West, Moon and Antartica...Blue Cadet(don't try to find it). This cd was a dissapointment. They left their orignal sound for a pop sound. I hope they go back to what they were before on their next release. I miss the old Mouse."
2,Modest Mouse Fans Beware,"If you've never heard Modest Mouse before, then I encourage you to buy this album. Its catchy, and enjoyable, and to those accustomed to the MTV/Radio menu, extremely unique.However, if you loved the almost primitive savant Isaac Brock embodied in ""Lonesome Crowded West"" or the chaotic, yet cohesive, eruption of genius that was ""The Moon and Antarctica"" DO NOT buy this album. Simply download the following tracks: 2, 6, maybe 7, 8, 11 and maybe 15. The remaining tracks, especially ""Float On"" represent a (hopefully) temporary breakdown in artistic integrity and an utter lack of originality. Worst of all, the genuine quality that has always been a natural presence in all of Modest Mouse's music is absent from most of these tracks. There's no soul, no intensity, and certainly no catharsis. The fact is, to the Modest Mouse faithfull, this album is boring."
1,Holy s**t,"Now just to set the record straight if there was a space for no stars that's what I would give this Cd. I bought this Cd because it was on sale for $7.99. I knew what it was doing on the charts soooo. I put my dollars down. got to the car slipped it in and holy S**T!!!! Now this sux! The production sux ! The songs Suck! Quite frankly, I don't know why anyone would even listen to it. I even went to the studio Put it in the KRK E8's and It sounds like a bunch of 10 year olds that got Apple Garageband for christmas and a new iMac computer and made a record?! What the.. Wow, this is what we've come too? No Thanks! that is some of the wimpiest, whatever I've ever heard. At least I didn't pay 10 bucks 4 it. With all the great music why would anyone like this!?? I know I'm missing something but Damn! this is just plain ol' fashion SUCK!!!!! Mouse is right..."
4,pumping in the modesty,"this cd, needless to say, is very different sounding than any of the previous modest mouse albums. it is just a very well crafted and thought out album. modest mouse really put in their hearts and all of their modesty that they could conjure up- into this cd. the first three songs (#1 doesn't count as a song) are wonderful and musically advanced songs, in addition ""black cadillacs"" which definitely strikes a chord with mua. however some of the music in the middle of these tracks is so-so and has a little more filler material than any of the rest. but 'float on"" is obviously the severe highlight of this album and deems ""Good news for people who love bad news"" a most triumphant cd and well worth your hard-earned money."
1,wow you guys are special...,"ok, this cd is not unique, the reason the indie community is upset is because it's comparitively very mainstream (for all you good charlotte/britney fans that means like everything else) it's not depressing either, if you want to hear modest mouse being depressing listen to: parasites will be excited when you're dead, cowboy dan, or maybe the cold part"
1,"If you like these guys, better artists/ CD's may be...","Less known: Mercury Rev, Superchunk, Sunny Day Real Estate, Archers of Loaf, Built to Spill, Dismemberment Plan, Panoply Academy Glee Club, The French Kicks, Tiara, The Fire Theft are all considerations... depending on your taste.Of course if you don't already have Elephant (White Stripes) and either of the last two Strokes, I'd gives those a listen first.While a couple singles are getting plenty of radio play, I bought this CD and was very unhappy with the rest of the tracks... long into the time I usually ""grow into"" a CD. Finally after a few weeks I gave up. Hopefully this will save you the regret and waisted money."
3,it was okay...,"This is another one of those cds I was happy to hear a friends copy of, but glad I didn't buy. I enjoyed the songs ""Bukouski"" and ""The Devil's workday"". And I only liked devil's workday because I think that Tom Waits is a genius and they were obviously listening to him and/or this other guy who's name escapes me. I want to say something like Captain Beefheart or something. I guess I can understand the hype with all the kids liking the indie music nowdays, maybe that's why I didn't freak out about it though..."
1,You have got to be kidding me.,"Please do yourself a favor and spend the $13.50 or so on something worthwhile or donate it to me if you are desperate to throw money away. This album has very little musical quality or merit and I cannot get through it again. Repetitive tones and words can be great in some songs, too bad this cd does not contain a song that it works in.I guess with some large company backing even something this bad can be considered Great. (Echos of Ashlee Simpson go here)And finally I see they received two grammy nominations for this album............2 nominations..........for this album..........This gives me hope to win a grammy with my new album ""Recordings from a Restroom"". Obviously this is what it takes to be a grammy winning artist these days."
2,Modest Mouse - Good News For People Who Love Bad News,Not what I expected. It wasn't as 'manly' as I had hoped.
3,total mediocrity fest,"Why is that when a band gets popular, the album that did it usually sucks?Such the case with Modest Mouse."
4,Modest Mouse what a change in music!,"Modest Mouse is yet a very different band but, also a very good band. Taking a spin off of music and making it all worth the listening time. The album touches on many different subjects and when singer Isaac Brock sings about real life situations, you can relate to them. But he puts the songs as if they are in a secret code. This band is awesome and I find this album very much worth it. Everything from the music to the album makes it worth your time. I would recommend this to anyone who likes all different types of music or if your more of an old school rocker...then you need to pick Modest Mouse up."
4,Grow up people..,"The boys from MM aren't getting any younger and as we all get older and realize that life is short and we only get ""one chance"", we tend not to hate everything as much as we did in our confused, ignorant and angry youth. Yes this album is softer than their previous which I grew up with but I would be embarrased as a MM fan to hear a new album that didn't grow up with them. The natural progession for many artists is to start angry and evolve from there. I expect everyone who disses this album because it's ""not the same MM"" is probably in their teens and early twenties, still angry at a world impossible to understand but wait til they reach 27,28.. then they'll realize that it is impossible to understand and everyone just needs to relax and not sweat the small stuff.. like a new MM album. Just let the new, fresh artists play with angst and let the MM boys age and experiment kids..."
2,tragedy strikes,"Modest Mouse is one of my all time favorite bands. It was Isaac's raw sound on earlier albums like Lonesome Crowded West and Sad Sappy Sucker that made the band unique and to me and pulsating with energy. Yes, this album is polished, but it is also watered down and much more boring compared to their older, jagged melodies that were throbbing with pain and electric. One would hope that when a band makes it big they're not selling out, but I feel like Modest Mouse just got dumb with their melodies. I for one shed a tear :("
3,not good to grow on,"usually, i like a band that can make me like them even after i've listened to the same songs over and over. this album has some really good songs on it, but after listening to the same ones repeatedly on tv and on the cd, i really dont like it anymore. this is not as true with the most of the older songs by modest mouse, so they would be a better buy."
4,need more sleep than coke,"For those who haven't heard the cd, the cd is worth the twelve bucks.A few reasons:IngenuityOriginalityDeepTo all you people who keep whining about the whiny vocals: This is your CD!In addition, songs (more specifically; good songs), tend to consists of musical notes that are orgainized into melodies and harmonies that repeat themselves.To the music listners that are uneducated as well as those who bash this album for the above said assumptions: Yall should not be wasting your time listening to music.Four stars because there is always room for improvement."
3,......and then it all went wrong.,"Modest mouse is one of my all time favorite bands, and I own and have extensively listened to them all. I've loved every little bit...until this album. they have traded in their unique sound and style for record sales. this is very noticeably more aimed at the Pop community. if you really want to hear good Modest Mouse, get an earlier album, or at least any other album."
4,Worth the money even if you already have it...,"This is absolutely one of my favorite albums of 2004. I own this on CD and vinyl and decided to sell my CD and buy the DualDisc instead. I love the fact that I have a digital version of ""I Got It All"" now! A 5.1 surround mix would have been nice, but the stereo mix on the DVD side still sounds better than the CD-quality audio. The music videos are a cool thing to have, and the animations from the website are just a gimme.Overall, if you don't own this album yet, pick up the DualDisc. If you do own this on CD, sell it and upgrade to the DualDisc you won't be sorry! It's definitely worth the extra $2.I only gave this 4 stars because of the absense of a surround mix."
1,Xcellent... if you like this sort of thing,"Clearly the bands popularity and radio play are bringing in lots of new fans. Personally I don't care if people who buy Britney and Avril like this too, more power to 'em. But for me - call it my special wierdness I know - this CD's lyrics and music just came across like it was trying too hard to appeal to the mainstream.Some bands are carried to greatness by working their butts off to produce a unique sound that leads a trend (think Nirvana), some find a way to enjoy momentary fame with hip sounds and luv'd up marketing. Not to say these guys are not working hard, its just that (to me) this CD has the smell of death about it for MM. Too bad, I really liked this CD until I played it a lot."
2,Bleh..,"I'm a huge Modest Mouse fan but this cd is by far their worst.If you're looking to get into Modest Mouse, buy Building Something Out of Nothing or The Moon and Antarctica instead..those cd's are brilliant."
1,crap,"After hearing Modest Mouse on Austin City Limits I am convinced that they are the worst rock band in history. How do you describe their music? You don't, because its not music. It's repetitive droning of slurred lyrics that carry no tune and have 0 sound appeal. If you like Modest Mouse you're retarded. Its not a matter of taste, it's the sad, simple truth.Edit:Sorry if I offended anyone, I was a bit hyped up over the whole thing. I still think they suck, though(either that or thier stage setup is really bad)."
2,"Not quite selling out, but....","Dissapointing. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, like any of the previous albums. I feel the same way about this album that I did about Phish's Hoist (dating and profiling myself with that one): a super-duper creative and original band that either got tired of being poor or had a run-in with a sleazy producer. Either way, buy all the old albums before you buy this one.My dissapointment doesn't mean that this is a bad album. It has it's bright spots. I just can't get down with the four-minute songs that sound overproduced and radio friendly. Sorry Isaac. I think you are a genius, but I turned in my Mousekateer card the day I heard this album"
1,"Worthy effort, but fails to please throughout","Like the last person, I liked the fact that each track is different. I'll give the band a point for that.Unfortunately, ""unique"" in this case was not a good kind of unique. While Float-on is a good single sure, I was looking for new sounds across the rest of the CD... but the new sounds just got harder to listen to the more play I gave it.The lyrics do attempt to be clever in their irreverence, but since some are canned ideas from other authors rather than coming from the heart... they eventually got to be as enjoyable as watching book-review re-runs; if such a thing actually exists. Yikes.Maybe a thousand fangirls will tell you otherwise, but for me - I was sorry I spent the money."
3,Where's Jeremiah? Where's Modest Mouse?,"This album sounds like an extension of ""Sharpen Your Teeth,"" Isaac's side project Ugly Cassanova's last release. While there are genuine moments and the ingredients remain the same, there is a lack of cohesion which stunts the growth of the album as time goes on and listens add up. Whether over-produced or simply over-thought, Modest Mouse has certaintly taken a step in a new artistic direction. The songs are bare and minimal. Isaac over dubs his voice in two opposite tones on most of the tracks (creating a dragging and slow effect) much like on ""Sharpen Your Teeth."" I am, however, excited by some of the music on the album. Transitional and brand new, perhaps as more time unfolds I can dig a little deeper into the steering wheel while I sing along.Not the right album to start off with (most accessible: Building Something..., most talented: Lonesome... and Long Drive.) in my stupid rambling opinion. Wish I took more time with this."
4,More Mainstream,"I first listened to Modest Mouse's ""Moon and Antarctica"", an album I soon became very fond of. I bought this album and it took me a little longer to realize that I liked it. With the exception of two songs, every song is fairly good. Blame it on the Tetons and Bukowski are lyrically exceptional. The others are less impressive but still enjoyable. I have yet to hear their previous albums but I will in short time."
1,Piece of junk that doesn't work even with replacement parts!,"I have had this for two years. It ran last winter till about March and quit producing heat. This fall I called and they sent me a part from Dimplex to hopefully resolve my problem. $65 later, still not fixed. After calling twice and waiting the one time 2 hours to speak to someone, they sent me another part free of charge. This fixed the fireplace for about two weeks and now I'm back to square one!!! Good luck if you buy this....cuz I have had no luck at all with this product!"
4,Hemke Reeds,"The reeds are of very good quality although their useful life is just a bit shorter than other reeds that I have used. I think that I may use a slighty harder reed the next time that I order,."
2,Review,The cut on the reeds was really bad. I would not recomend this. When i use these reeds my sax sounds really bad
2,Not worth the buying,Was not too excited about the oil when I started using it. Really it is just a mix of oils you can buy at a natural food market or a vitamin store.
5,Love it!,"Worth the money! Smells like spa, penetrates in skin leaving it hydrated but not greasy. Ive used during my pregnancy along with the cream and did not get one strech mark!:)"
1,Does LaCie really provide customer service?,"I didn't have this drive up and running long enough to truly rate it. I transferred 150 gigs of data to the drive and it worked fine - for two hours. Then it disappeared from my desktop and will no longer mount. Worse still is that LaCie Technical Support seems to have disappeared as well. I've written them 4 times and have yet to receive a response. I'm afraid I should have headed the warnings, but an older LaCie drive I have has lasted several years. I'll be asking Amazon for help in getting a refund from this deadbeat company. Does LaCie really provide customer service"
4,Second Time Perfect,"The unit arrived and my PowerBook G4 operating Tiger OS failed to recognize it when all connections were made. LaCie customer support walked me through some testing and identified the unit as the likely problem. Amazon replaced it overnight. Second unit operated perfectly from the start to a complete backup. Based on the ease off use and solid support, I would recommend this unit."
1,Ramakrishna Revisited : A New Biography,Very good writing skills with a great deal of printing errors. The picture of Sri Ramakrishna is very badly printed. The picture and errors together make the repute of the publisher questionable.The contents are misconstrued and often out of context to represent the personal interpretations and reflections of the author rather than a historic perspective. A waste of money and time! There is really no message in this book other than some negative expressions.
4,"Great coffee, good customer service",My husband loved the coffee and keeps it to brew for special occasions/guests.
2,Cute but Narrow!,I love this shoe but the front strap is very narrow and if you have a wide foot this shoe is not for you.
3,I like Sayulita salt,"This coarse sea salt has more mineral flavor. At past I used `Himalayan Crystal Salt (Coarse Granulated)'. Though it has 84 minerals mixed with it, it lacks iodine. `The Sayulita Sea Salt' compensates the needs of iodine. The white crystals give a fresh look. Himalayan salt is mined from the ground, like coal. So, this was not always good. This Sayulita salt is more health friendly.Sayulita Sea Salt - Organic Coarse - 16 oz - by RealGoodSalt"
5,good chance to upgrade!,"It was a great deal for me to upgrade my cell phone, but I'm not sure this prmotion is still available."
1,This book is a commercial,"Agreed that they may have a great record in forecasting business cycles, but when i buy a book that is titled ""how to predict and profit from turning points in the business cycle"", i expect more in answers than them just telling me to follow their indicators. Outrageous that they make people pay for the book. book is very light on the chest."
1,"Lot of fluff, almost no content","The actual information in this book would fit on one page: inflation, employment, and output are the drivers of the business cycle. The rest of the book is just a 200 page ad for the authors' advisory service. Their service may be quite good, but you can't tell from this book since it contains no data or hard statistical analysis. Save your money."
1,For beginners only!!!!,"If you are not familiar with the concepts of economic forecasting and don't mind paying for information, this book may not be a bad read. However, if you do know how the economy and stock market operate and have access to cnn/fn, cnbc, bloomberg t.v. etc. to get your economic data, this book is not for you. It probably will not teach you anything that you don't already know. Most of your reading time will be spent learning about how great the authors think they are and how their subscription website can help. There is very little emphasis on teaching you how to interpret the easily available information for yourself. There are definitely much better books out there on the subject. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on books that will teach you how to figure it out for yourself."
4,"High quality, beautifully arranged coffee-table book, but...","Yes, it is a book of highest print quality (printed in Italy), with some wonderful photos, and very true to the movie's original dialogue(I should know, I have seen it four times...). But, it is just that....Neither it is very insighful nor is it the best example of Mr.Fry literary wit. Overall, it is a fine gift for someone, who loves Jude Law or the movie itself VERY VERY MUCH... As for the man in question himself, i.e. Oscar Wilde, this book is nothing special, because so was the movie."
1,This item is very disappointing,Causes lights to blink on and off constantly day and night Makes no difference what type of bulb ie incandescent or flourescent / Tried repositioning and adjusting the aperture cover in accord with instructions Nothing corrected the defect.
5,The Zenith of Musical Imagery,"Both CDs are examples of musical storytelling and imagery at their best. Wonderfully diverse talent, great tunes and lyrics, and a faithful representation of history. White Mansions in particular represents just how strongly the feelings remain about a war that took place nearly 150 years ago in which 620,000 Americans died, more than in all other wars combined. I never grow tired of either CDs, and have ordered additional copies as back-ups."
5,Country's Greatest Song Writer,"I first heard cuts from The Legend of Jesse James on an airline in December of 1981, checked the information magazine to find out what I was listening to and bought the album within a week. I am also fortunate enough to have the White Mansions album and later bought the CD combo. Reason; I marveled at Paul Kennerly's writing and production skills. I still love to listen to both of these over 20 years later. And, I've made it a point to purchase any album/CD where Kennerly is listed as a writer of any song. From ex-wife Emmylou Harris, to Waylon Jennings, to Tanya Tucker, to The Everly Brothers and many more, I have loved every one. But, Mansions and James stand out as they are pure Kennerly throughout. These are masterpieces for the country fan. Don't disappoint yourselves; buy the masterpieces!"
5,not just another hollywood star,"This book was amazing, soem people may dismiss it because it was written by an actress, but let me tell you this journal is not only touching and heartfelt, but it's raw emotion. This is a first person acount of what she sees and its truly amazing all the things discussed and how it opens your eyes to everything going on that you never learn about, and as said in the book, ""I have been a photographer for ten years. American press don't buy these kinds of pictures. Other countries do."" if you care at all about life and othe humans this is a must read!"
5,Insightful & inspiring,"It's impossible to read this book and complain about your life. The work that the UNHCR does is amazing in every sense of the word. Great read and gives you a small insight into a huge worldwide problem. Whether you love Angelina Jolie or not, it's hard not to have admiration for all her humanitary work. Absolutely loved this book!"
2,not up to expectations,"While sound quality was excellent, the hum and noise levels were audible during quiet passages when listening to classical music."
2,Get Altecs,"These bose computer speakers would be good if you have a real small desk. I am a rock musician and when I hear tracks I've played on that where recorded, mixed, and mastered in professional studios... I can tell you these speakers are not the best.Pros:- Looks- Very clear mids and highsCons:- Lack of bass- When you turn them up loud (not even very loud) they distort- Mids can get overdriven especially on guitarSpend your money on Altec Lansing speakers with the sub woofer."
2,Big money. Big name. Small sound.,"These speakers sound like a pair I would expect to pay about $10 for. $99 is ridiculous. All you are buying is the Bose name. I've heard Bose makes good speakers, but not these. I took mine back and got the Creative T-20s."
2,Not so much a companion...,"I bought these speakers a while back. I heard them in the store, they sounded great. I thought, these will make my high end system sound amazing. WRONG! They ultimately suck... with one redeeming quality: they look nice. Trust me, I'm a recording engineer and listen to a plethora of music, and these speakers just don't cut the mustard. With little to no low end and a slightly tinny higher end, they weakly exhibit your music, unless all you listen to is Vivaldi. I have yet to replace these little suckers, but that only comes down to affordability for quality hardware. I wouldn't say that ALL Bose speakers suck, because I have heard others (with subs) that, at least, represent a low end. But I will say that anything, and I do mean anything, sounds better than these. If you are looking for cheap, mediocre-sounding computer speakers that you only plan on listening to podcasts with, go for it. If you like music... don't betray your ears with these. But... they look purdy."
5,great buy!!!!,"10 dls cheaper than Best Buy and Ciruit City, these pair of speakers really do the job...the sound is not too loud tough..."
5,Very clean sound,"Well, for 100 bucks you can't have a hall-type of system, but if you have a small room or studio, those speakers have a very clear and defined sound to listen to music, I use them every day, and the range of sound for music is just awesome.They are also very elegant and good looking, and they are solid too,Enjoy your tunes !!!!!"
2,Disappointed,"The Companion 2 multimedia speakers have been a big disappointment. I had to put thecpu on the desk because the cord was too short. The speakers have a continuous weaving buzzing sound that aBose tech tried to eliminate by changing the power connection, but that was completely useless.The sound is good, but I have to recommend against the purchase of these speakers."
2,Listen before you buy!,"I really like the build quality of these speakers compared to others at the same price range. Also the ability to connect two devices at once was very helpful.BUT, the sound leaves much to be desired. They sound like another reviewer said... ""no highs, no lows, it must be Bose."" If you play games or enjoy listening to vocals DO NOT BUY THESE SPEAKERS! I returned them and bought the Klipsch 2.1 ProMedia speakers - which sound very very clear and the sub offers plenty of ""clean"" bass. Also, it provides a second mini jack port so you can connect other devices - like cd players, and ipods - without the need to buy an adaptor (like the Bose)."
4,Bose Companion 2 Series II Multimedia Speakers,I needed speakers that would produce really good sound at a reasonable price for my Macbook Pro. I reviewed several brands and decided to go with the Bose Companion 2. I've now used them for several weeks and I am very pleased with the sound while listening to audio and video files. I would recommend them to anyone needing speakers for a laptop or desktop computer.
1,Had a listen to them in a local electronic store.,When are people going to realize that Bose is all Marketing and no quality. I also had and Acoustimass 10 System and sold it within a month. The bass was really muddy and the highs just weren't there. Don't buy these! I just bought a pair of Ailses and they are wonderful. I wouldn't recommend these to my worst enemy. My god people wake up and look around for once instead of falling for this marketing bs
1,would be ok if it cost under $20,These speakers are terrible. The $20 altec lansings I wanted to replace sound much better. Someone on another forum said they are only good for one thing: target practice.Bose should be ashamed putting their name on these and ripping people $100 off.Enough said.
1,Over Rated and Crappy Sound,Over Rated and Crappy Sound. Sound same as my monitor speaker on my Samsung LCD how sad is that? NO base no Med's No high's Just make some noise. After reading peoples reviews and I thought with 4 stars worth a try. I hook it up for 5 M and Took it out and send it back . If the price is $10 I would have keep it but I think $10 speakers from swap meets are even better. I order a Logitech Speaker System Z623 and is only $30 dollar more and it sound 1000x better. Don't waste your time on this crap from Bose.
4,Great item !!,"These speakers are a little bit bigger than they look in the picture. However, in typical Bose style, they are an excellent investment and work great."
5,Excellent sound...as TV speakers!!,"I got these speakers for free from one of the vendors I deal with for an Xmas gift. So, of course, the price was right. But since I already had top-notch speakers on both of my home computers, I wasn't sure what to do with them. Alas...to the family room and my crappy, 27"" Panasonic tube television, which is stereo but whose speakers blow. I figured since these speakers are amplified, I could hook them up to my TV's audio out jacks. And whaddya know. It worked great. So now I have nice Bose sound coming out of my previously crappy sounding TV. What a difference it makes when watching music DVDs or musical performances on broadcast TV. So, while I can't speak as to how these speakers will sound with a computer, I can tell you that they work great with a stereo TV with audio out jacks. I probably never would've bought these just to use with the TV. But I'm sure glad I got them for free, because they're totally cool. Nice looking, too."
1,dont waste your money or time with these,got these speakers because i didnt have much room on or around my computer desk for speakers.... i liked the way they looked (although they are bigger- tall and deep- than i expected) but had a clean look to it. then i went to test the sound - and all i can say is the sound was decent - not great - not bad... until i started cranking the volume a little-... then the sound started fading in and out- it was like somebody would take the volume button and turn it down and then turn it back up. so i googled if anyone else had this problem with these speakers...and found some instances on the web. i called the bose guy to see if i had maybe done something wrong or if he had a suggestion... he said he never heard of a system doing that- return it and he would send me some more...very nice about it. but im gonna return to amazon and choose another set of speakers... bose had their chance.
2,Not Made For Music Listening,No Mid level sounds to capture true music sounds. Only highs and lows.Good for watching movies and gaming but that is all.I bought these speakers and returned them the same day due to poor performance.
5,Bosie desk-top speakers,These speakers give my iTunes life a new enjoyment (without headphones) They are WONDERFUL !
2,Mixed review...,"When I first opened the box, I was impressed. These speakers were very much aesthetically pleasing. Also, the build quality was quite nice.As for the sound, these speakers are not so stellar. My first impression was that it was almost as if Bose had tried to make these speakers not image. I have sampled numerous speakers over the years, Martin Logans, Quads, B&Ws;, Magnepans, and various other brands, granted these are not computer speakers and are not in the same price range, they sound great and image fantastically. Even my cheap computer speakers image well. The Bose Companion 2 is full of decent sounding bass, but the mids and highs, though clear, are lacking, as is typical of Bose. Also, the lack of an on/off switch is quite odd, and disturbs me.These are decent speakers, but I would recommend that you try other brands before buying these."
5,"Bose, what elese can be said?","I am extremely delighted with these speakers. Sitting at the computer, I feel like I am at a live performance, even six feet away, the sound is strong and bold. Make sure when you purchase it is Series II. There are some Series I speakers being discounted that are sub-par to Series II."
3,Never mind the audio quality....,"...these speakers stink--literally. A month after unboxing them they continue to reek, and I have finally accepted the fact that I need to unplug them and let them air out on the deck for a day. The toxic scent, which might be euphemistically dubbed Eau de Chinois, is so strong that quibbling over bass performance or midrange-this or high-end that is totally beside the point. What in God's name are these things made from? OK, in the interest of relevancy I'll say that the sound is good but that you are unquestionably paying a premium for a Bose logo, but I do like the easy access to the headphone jack, and the on/off/volume knob works well (it has a nice feel). If you are listening to music via iTunes I recommend you play with the EQ setting, I think I changed mine from ""Pop"" to ""Rock"" and got a noticeable improvement, even lightish pop songs seemed to need this boost."
2,"Not Awful, But Strange Processing Problems","I bought these, trusting in the Bose name and quality that is usually inherent in their products. However, once I put them through the paces, a fatal flaw became readily apparent.For music that is simple and not very dynamic, these speakers have excellent clarity. However, when I put on fast, hard music, the whole processing fell apart. They basically sound like they've been overcompressed and that a random envelope filter has been applied. The effect is not as noticeable at lower volumes, but at higher it is completely destructive. Listening to Chopin piano pieces, it was excellent. But try playing the Dead Kennedy's version of ""Take this Job"" and suddenly everything sounded like it was in a tin can. Muddy, overprocessed and awful.I suppose I won't completely give up on Bose, and I realize this is the cheapest thing they sell. But I expected a lot more from them."
4,"Great sound, timeless look!","These speakers have great sound quality and are very easy to setup and use, I like the added feature of a headphone jack in the right speaker. Most of all it has a classic look that will not go out of style."
2,bad,"this is not the movie to watch. the plot sucks, and there is uneven acting and the movie gets boring after a while"
2,Poor suction,We ordered the Hoover Savvy Bag/Bagless through Amazon via EKithchenandGadgets.com on 11-22-04 and received it on 12-23-04. I could never get a status on the order and I actually thought we were ripped off. The vaccum is very poor when it comes to hardwood floors or cermic tile. I find myself picking up many things it left behind. I have been using it with the bag though. It might be better using it bagless. I am very dissapointed in this vaccum. I am sorry I got rid of my Electroux after 18 years. It preformed much better even with its age.
2,Not what I expected,"This review is not as much about the product as it is the service. After ordering, I tried to cancel but the product had already shipped. OK, fine. But then I find that it came US mail, and I was at work and I was not here to refuse the package. I ended up having to send it back as a return, for which they charge $6.95. I don't mind paying for return shipping, but I regularly ship packages and this went back parcel post, I could send this weight package anywhere in the country for under $3 first class. As for the product, I had found something I liked better, and I'm glad I did because the item didn't really match how it was portrayed. They did ship quickly, so I will give them kudos for that. Unfortunately for me, it was just a bit too quick and I ended up losing my original shipping plus the return shipping."
5,"Wonderfully nostalgic, ""feel-good"" movie.",This movie shows why Debbie Reynolds became a star and why so many people came to adore her. It gives you a hint as to why the fifties was such a special time in America.
4,An excellent CD,"This was the fourth CD I purchased from this band. It is a little more pop focused than one of their typical offerings, though all of their CDs have some pretty hard rocking tunes. There are a few songs on this one that are some of my favorites overall. Anyone who like good old hard rock will really enjoy this disk.Addendum: After listening to this CD a few times through it has become one of my favorites.I rate this CD 6 stars. My apologies to the band. The operational software won't let me change the rating I gave it on my first review."
1,Reno Benteen,"As a serious Bible prophecy student I depend heavily on good Bible scholarship and Biblical commentary. When seeking these works I look for those that clearly clarify each and every verse. As well as provide as much background imformation on the suject as possiable. Since scholars often times differ on their interpretations, works that present a fair representation of divergent scholarly view are preferable. Again as a student a good bibliography is a must for study and continued growth. Last of all the author should stick to the subject at hand and not twist Biblical commentary to meet their own personal theological ideas and present such as absolute fact. Sadly, in all the above, this work fails miserably. The author tries to present non dispensational, antiquated Romanesque, post trib, replacement theology as if it were indeed fact. As a student I cannot in good faith recommenedthis volume to anyone who is truly serious about understanding the book of Revelation."
2,mediocre at best,"Some reviewers admired the dry British wit supposedly exhibited in The Gunseller. The actor Laurie should stick to acting and not writing, as this book is both adolescent and confusing. The amateurish plot meanders all over the place and proceeds rather like a old British sports car, bouncing and leaking oil indiscriminately. His blues music album is considerably better than this dog of a book."
2,The Gun Seller,"Hugh Laurie needs to go back to acting. The characters and story were hard to connect to. I thought it felt contrived and not in a ""good"" way."
4,Fun to read,"Really fun read! It is like Birtie Wooster and House got together to write this book. The book moves quickly, never boring. I find myself laughing out loud sometimes. I am glad I traveled in the UK so I understand the British terms he uses."
2,Painful,Made a novel out of a short story by adding unnecessary words. Reading it was very laborious and not a labor of love.
3,Shades of Bertie,"I was prompted to buy the book because of my huge admiration for P.G. Wodehouse, Bertie Wooster and Hugh Laurie. Having read a couple of Stephen Fry's books I was most curious! 'The Gun Seller' was well written, entertaining, intelligent and fun, although not terribly profound, which, if it were, would have not been all the fun it was! I hope Hugh Laurie writes again!!"
2,He's trying too hard to be funny,"I bought this book because I enjoyed Hugh's acting in the TV series House and his interview. However, exaggeration is a better strategy for him in acting than in writing.The beginning of the book is intriguing, both in writing and story-telling. Nevertheless, after 20 pages, the really-long-sentence-with-forced-in-humors became irritating. The book tries too hard to sound funny, which somehow interferes the flow of the story. I stopped after about 30 pages, so it might get better later on, but I can't say that.If you like books that read like a comedy show and are not very demanding for a well-plotted story, I would recommend The Good Omen by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett."
4,Pure entertainment,"Who'd have thought Hugh Laurie would be so entertaining as an author. A great story, made me laugh out loud. It feels like House's sense of humour crept in to the book. I recommend it to anyone who read Douglas Adams as a kid."
4,From commedian to craftsman- Laurie delivers,"Many comedians make the transition from entertainment to literature, with varied success. Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie's friend and collegue, made the transition with such bestsellers as ""The Liar"", delivering a wit that only a comedic wordsmith can. Laurie's debut offering ""The Gun Seller"" makes its mark with no less quality.Based in the genre of the hapless spy, ushered by the powers that be, Laurie acheives a new depth of with and perception, through characters and complexity of plot, that make this novel more than just an entertaining read.The story is addictive, the protagonist a delightful anti-hero, and the language worthy of Hope and Campbell. Its the type of novel that has you dog-earing pages so you can return and ponder the mastery of Laurie's expression and wit.If you like a good laugh, love a great book, and are a sycophant for prose of the post-modern, then ""The Gun Seller"" is for you."
4,Hugh in Character,"Hugh, thankfully, stays in character from page first to page last. I'm hoping he meant us to be comfortable with the lead - as we were always comfortable with Bertie. If so, my vote for the movie lead is Hugh Laurie."
5,The Gun Seller is a great read!,The Gun Seller is a great read. Hugh Laurie's writing style is reminiscent of P.G. Wodehouse. The juxtaposition of this narrative style with an action/spy-thriller is highly entertaining. It is also part of why this story is an excellent spoof of the spy-thriller genre while also being a good spy-thriller itself. It's a highly enjoyable novel and I'm looking forward to the follow-up.
5,I feel extremely guilty.,"I simply don't believe I've paid enough for this book. I think of the amount of legal pleasure the average twenty-odd dollars would buy me -- a couple of movie tickets and Zagnut, one CD plus a few limp dance tracks -- and I just think Mr. Laurie has given me a super bargain. ""The Gun Seller"" is like a tickle fight in a dark maze -- I was alternately excited, frightened, baffled, amazed, and panting from laughter. If Mr. Laurie or any of his representatives read this, please let me know where to send the other thirty-five dollars of my money I believe he deserves."
3,There are better books in this genre for the money.,"Entertaining enough but with a dry British humor that has only occasional and widely spaced chuckles. As far as comic caper/mysteries go this pales in comparison to the works of Donald Westlake, Carl Hiaasen and Laurence Shames. If someone hands you a copy, read it, but if you're spending your own money you can certainly do better."
3,Hmmmmm,"Well, I read the book. I loved the way it was written, very funny. But the mainstory was hard for me to find. Perhaps because I am not native english, perhaps because I didnt read the book in one time. But it really was a pitty that I lost it many times. I think it is easier when you read it at once (dont stop) and maybe being native english is a very big plus too. I liked it though. It appeared to me as being a little cheap, but that guy is a great fantasy-man. I dont think it is worth reading if you only read serious literature. If you want to read something funny on a vacation, you might find this book as a very good pleasing solution..."
5,Big as a windshield,"Nice view. Didn't work for me because my windshield is small and it blinded out too much view forward. I sent it back but it was a nice mirror. I can't offer much else than to say if size is an issue, consider the dimensions."
5,This books are amazing,My son owns the whole series and by the time he was 2 1/2 he was naming the paintings and who the artist was. He has learnt so much and it has inspired me to read up on the artists so that I can enrich his experience.The books are sturdy and he has really enhjoyed them
4,Krokus - 'Hellraiser' (Locomotive),"A surprisingly good 2006 all-new Krokus CD release. 'Hellraiser' proves that after thirty years the Swiss heavy rockers had formed is still able to assemble a worthy piece of work. Only downside for some fans might be the factor that guitarist Fernando Von Arb was forced to stay off this record due to a serious wrist injury. Disc lists just three musicians - Marc Storace - vocals, Mandy Meyer - guitar and Stefan Schwarzmann - drums. Take it from a long-time '80's metal fan, this CD should definitely satisfy most old school Krokus followers. Tracks like the upbeat ""Too Wired To Sleep"", ""Hangman"", ""Turn' Inside Out"" and ""Luv Will Survive"" are good for many - MANY spins in the time to come."
1,Review,well-known book. but it is bad printing quality. i think it is photocopied not original book!!!!!
2,Almost fell getting off of this.,"I think this thing is dangerous. I nearly feel as I was stepping off of it. It stuck to my shoe a little bit, and, as I of course still had a hold of the attached resistance bands, it was a pretty unstable situation. I have thrown it out. I will echo what others have said about the small platform, too. Even though I have very small feet I also disliked that the platform is way small. Just stand on a couple resistance bands instead."
4,brings back memories,"This 50 year collection brought back such wonderful church memories for me as a teenager in an Air Force gospel chior. We sang every one of those songs The Only song I did not enjoy was the newer version of ""My Mind's Made Up"" very disapointing. My motto is if it's not broke don't fix it. the original recording was excellent. Thanks for the memories!"
2,"Very, very weak!",The author is never concerned with the proofs. This book is for that student who likes memorizing formula and don't want to learn the subject.
1,terrible customer service from KwikTek,"I used the bungee dock line twice and the knot came completely undone, and it is impossible to retie it the right way. I've emailed and called KwikTek 3 times and have never gotten a response. I'm hoping to get a replacement, but they never respond to emails or voicemails."
3,"Tiny print, dry reading, but great reference","I love to read straight through my books to learn everything I can, but I couldn't do it with this one. It is a very detailed reference book with everything you always wanted to know about forms, including every obscure thing you didn't care to know or that's no longer browser supported. It is incredibly dry to read, and the print is tiny. I had to keep jolting myself to stay with it, and could only read a bit at a time. There is absolutely nothing friendly about this book. It is a very detailed and complete reference book on forms, and that's its value. As a quick reference book, it succeeds. As a read-through, it fails."
2,"Nice lamp, but not lasting very long.","Bought a 2 pack of the 50w bulbs to use with a Zoo Med Deluxe Porcelain Clamp Lamp, and the first bulb already burned out. It lasted 15 days. It's on a timer, and on 13 hours a day. We'll see how well the 2nd bulb does before I think about ordering these again. You would think that these would last longer."
2,"Loud, very loud",".. I found this release to be rather ""screechy"", and not very interesting to listen to. Any of the other releases, Adiemus I - III, would be better, but the first is still the best."
2,Not very well-rounded,"I would have liked to have known more about the lives of bands like Suffocation, Autopsy, At The Gates, Atheist, Gorguts, etc. I found the book to be way too geared toward Napalm Death/Carcass."
2,if you never saw the sun a light bulb is bright,"Several reviewers gave this artist and album rave reviews, stating that he was talented and an expert in several genres. I can only wonder how old they are. Clearly they have never heard the Kaleidoscope Side Kicks album. There is a group which can make the top performers in various music genres envious. It doesnt mean there arent some good cuts, ""Oh Berta Berta"" by itself alone is worth the price of the album and then some. It just means that if you've never heard better, then you quite possibly dont know better."
5,A Timely Reminder,"Chris Hedges' book is a highly readable reminder of what this Judeo Christian society that is in the press so much these days is really supposed to be. Without preaching. Mr Hedges manages to make the commandments a stinging commentary on life's real priorities in America while pointing out how far we have strayed from the true meaning of the decalogue handed down to us. Hedges points out that we have have traded faith for jingoism and wisdom for righteousness to suit our cultures fascination with power, wealth and individuality. It should be required reading for all of us."
3,Smaller than I thought .. but has good grip and cuts really well,When I ordered it on Amazon initially for some reason I thought it was a bit bigger .. but apart from that it cuts really well ..
3,yummy,they are good but for the size you get im giving it a 3 start very high priced for the size of the bags but very yummy
2,Thermostat is glitchy,"Bought this thermostat and when installed tested it agains the three other thermostats in my house and it was four degrees off consistently. I contacted Skytech and they said it is normal to be off 2 to 3 degrees. They said I could send it back for calibration. I just received this. I wasn't about to send it back. Now after programming several times, there is a glitch that on Sunday the set temperature is glitchy and continues to run past the set temperature.I like it but it has many problems."
5,cute and dainty,"I bought this cute and dainty bracelet for a toddler's Christmas present. The service was fast, the price right."
3,You don't have to have bad hair to like this one,"Jolene & Ry have always been caught in the crossfire of their two families' long-standing feud. The O'Malleys and the Corbetts have been the small North Carolina town's own version of the Hatfields an the McCoys as far back as anyone can remember. Jolene has always had a crush on Ry since he accidentally felt her up when he saved her from drowning in his family's hotel's pool several years earlier.After a long absence, divorced Ry returns to town with his teenage daughter in tow after the death of his grandpa to tear down the his inheritance - the local hotel and breakfast buffer - and rid himself of the town once and for all. He does not count on anything making him want to stay. Then he runs into Jolene again and the sparks fly as Jolene tries to get him to change his mind about tearing down the hotel and about the bad blood between their families."
3,Good Books,"The books were fine. The error was mine in that I was expecting a larger sized book,like Jeff Scharra's Civil War Battlefields 7"" x 9"" book. The books I bought were 4"" x 6 3/4""I would have preferred hard cover books like the other Scharra books I already have."
2,"Blah, blah, blah... ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","The author does know what he is talking about, but he presents the material in such an uninteresting fashion that I actually fell asleep while reading it! It also may be too difficult for people that are not ""mathematically inclined."" He should have left out some details and instead put in some more stories and colorful language so that the reader will not feel like it is fourth period calculus with that monotone teacher. It is good for learning the material, but it is very difficult just to read for any reason."
4,almost as good as E.E.Smith,"I just finished reading The Dragon Lensman, and though it was not as satisfying as the first six books of E.E. Smith's Lensman Series, it was still fantastic reading.I had started reading it before, but laid it down unfinished. Then I discovered Z Lensman, read it, enjoyed it, then came back and read Dragon.I do suggest, however, that you read Dragon first, then Z second, as Z builds on some of the events of Dragon, then, of course, read the Rigellian version.If you love E.E.Smith's books, as I do, then definitely read David Kyle's three Lensman books, written from the points of view of the other three Second Stage Lensmen."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This book was a big disappointment. It gave no helpful information and seemed very farfetched. The only good thing in this book was it showed the writer's determination to find a successful treatment for this disease. But it gave you no answers and was vague the whole way through. It mentioned different things in your surroundings to change to improve your health, such as fabrics and furniture, never mentioning what those fabrics were. At the end of the book it gives you a website. The website is nothing more than a place selling CD's and information supposedly to unlock this secret. Complete waste of money."
2,lacking information,"The book leaves big question marks.The site refered at the end of the book does not reply to those questions. If Jane and Victor realy wanted to write a book to help others would give more information.At times it seems a publicity book for a specific healer.Then the name of the book is wrongly chosen.What are these cloths and bedding and furniture? where is important info about nutrition? etc..Never the less ,if read as a novel then it is interesting to see the journey of a person at the other side of the globe with the same illness."
1,Disapointed,I agree entirely with the other reviews. This book is of no use whatsoever and Amazon should be ashamed to advertise it's features.Perhaps the author would like to comment herself and explain why she gives no helpful advice at all.A completely misleading book
2,"Great at keeping drink hot, but lid continually comes off","Loved this tumbler for the first few months, then the lid started to come off. If you fill the tumbler with coffee, it will continually come off. Once the tumbler is 1/2 to 3/4 full the lid will stay on better. I still gave this tumbler 2 stars because I love the size and style of this tumbler and the fact that coffee stays hot forever, but the lid is too much trouble for me.I called Thermos customer service and they offered to replace my tumbler with another insulated tumbler that has a screw down lid. Great customer service from thermos.I you are buying this to use in a car, I would reccomend that you get one of the thermos brand tumblers with the screw down lid."
3,"The insulation effect is good, but water leakage","I bought this mug is to carry water Convenienttly when i travel,but now when i use it ,i found when it carry water the water will leaking out.i am disappointed"
5,Greatest Mug on Earth,"This is the third Stainless steel mug I purchased. I use ice in it sometimes and if I leave the mug on my desk I still have ice the next day. My husband and I fill our mugs with coffee before going to a football game and when the game is over, the coffee is still hot. It is the greatest. I gave this mug to my boss for Christmas. She loves it."
3,Does a great job...BUT...,"I love this tumbler when I got it as a gift for Christmas. I have never found anything as nice as this. It kept my coffee HOT for HOURS! It's super easy to clean and as a very nice grip to it. BUT...the lid. Oh the stupid lid. The rubber seal gets very weak very fast. When I first bought it, the vacuum seal stayed pretty good. Now, 4 months later, it slides right off with just the slightest touch...like when I take a drink! I'm torn because I've love this thing so much but I can't see spending $15-$20 ever 4 months for it....or can I?"
1,Leakmaster,"It's so close to a great travel mug with a fatal flaw: it leaks, splashes, and spills. Kind of defeats the purpose of a ""Travel Tumbler"". It retains heat much longer than my plastic insulated mugs and has a nice feel with the rubber grip. But with the drink hole slider shut, coffee manages to splash out of the cover on my walk from the car to office. If it tilts in the cup holder turning a corner - it leaks. The top just pushes (rather than screws) in and has the tendency to pop off. I just ordered and received a Sipps Thermos so this waste of $20 is getting relegated to the closet or trash."
2,"Great cup, Major flaw","I must say that there are several things I love about this cup. For one, it keeps drinks hot and cold for a very long time. I can leave this cup in my car for 4 hours on a 20 degree morning and the contents will still be hot when I go to drink it. Second, it is dishwashable. It's hard to find a good cup that you can throw in the dishwasher.Now the flaw. As has been stated numerous times before this awesome cup has a stupid lid design. Ever since about 3 weeks after I bought the cup the lid refuses to stay on. You don't have to tip it or jolt it even. As we speak it is sitting on my desk with the lid popped off, all by itself. I've resorted to taping it down with medical tape every time I use it. That works fine except I didn't pay 20 bucks for a coffee cup that requires the lid to be taped down. Not to mention if the tape comes unstuck it dumps all over my shirt.All in all, if you are looking for a good coffee cup, keep looking."
4,loving it,great everyday commuting accessory and work companion especially during stressful hours; my husband and friend also love it for daily use
1,freezes and does not charge properly,the item freezes and does not charge propperly once it has most of its memory filled.
5,BEST Show I've Seen in a While,"Absolutely love this show. I didn't grow up in the 70s, but I still can't get enough of this show! Haven't missed an episode yet, and don't plan to! I will be utterly disappointed if they don't pick it up for a second season!"
4,Great Mug,This is one of the best mugs I have ever had! Cold things stay cold and hot things stay hot. If you leave ice in overnight most of it will be there in the morning.
3,Knights of Malta Has Plenty of Detail,"If you are interested in an indepth history of this ancient religious order and its impact on Europe and the Catholic Church then this book is a good bet for you. Sire provides tons of historical data and you can tell that this text was very well researched. Having said that, Knights of Malta was a somewhat difficult read for me. The author assumes the reader has some fluency in Latin and in French as there are no translations of certain passages of text. Likewise the writing style is more reminiscent of a college text book. I can't fault Sire in providing so much historical detail but in so doing, the overall feel of this book is very dry."
1,A lot of money for a toy.,"I am quite disappointed at the quality and power of this unit, both markly low. I thought that it would be able to send a decent signal through the wall to the next room from my computer to where my radio and home stereo is but it is a very faint, scratchy, and weak signal. So if you are not right on top of your radio, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! The short coiled cord which plus in to the output of a iPod or computer is less than sufficient for most applications. It has so much spring in the coil and the length is so short that it pulls the tiny featherweight unit until the coil has basically retracted back to its original shape. Poorly designed. Poorly constructed. Heavily marketed. With shipping I lost about $75 for something I will never use."
5,I wonder how I lived without it!,"Amazingly simple to use right out of the box. Plays all my mp3's from my hard drive to any radio in the house and the back yard. Much easier to use than a low power fm radio station transmitter hooked to your computer, and at a third of the cost. The range seemed short at first, (I initially got about forty feet) but with proper antenna height and position, attention to grounding values and finding an absolutely clear station without any station on either side, I can and do get over 170 feet in range. It's also digital with PLL tuning, which means no frequency drift. Fans with amatuer radio experience will not have a problem with this unit. Technical support is available from the manufacturer to assist the novice with range and interference questions. Best investment I've made in a long time."
4,Use the fix and be happy,"Out of the box, this unit was not very good.... Using great care, I lifted the rear label with a very small electronics screwdriver and easily accessd the turbo boost on this device. Now it is doing what I had hoped. Signal is hitting all 3 floors of my 3000 sq. ft. home and ALL of my neighbors can tune into my new station! Now if I would have only known about this b4 I purchased way too many Squeezebox's... Oh well, enjoy!"
3,C Crane FM Transmitter,"I have used the FM transmitter just about everyday for the two weeks I have had it and it has delivered as I expected from having read the reviews of those who have gone before. I did the adjustment and find the range through walls at about 30 feet max. I also had to move the unit several feet from my laptop which is the source of the programming I wanted to transmit. The static when close to the computer was bad, but the fix was simple. I do have to use most of the length of the coiled cord to separate the unit, though. Also, when I turn the unit off it forgets the frequency I was using, so I must reset the frequency each time I turn it on--a small annoyance. In all, it does the job and I am pleased."
2,fm transmitter,"I purchased transmitter and had to send the first one back, I couldn't get it to transmit over 10 feet. I received another one quickly and this did transmit up to 50 ft which was fine but the quality was not up to par. Luckly my XM RADIO transmitter started working again with a clear signal. Amazon was not the problem, they were efficient!!"
1,you told me so,"i read several bad reviews of this product but figured i'd try to save a few bucks and buy it rather than the more expensive transmitters. i mean, how bad could it be right? it's just as bad, if not worse than a lot of these reviews have described. i used the feature on crane's web site to find the best frequencies to use in my area and still could barely get a sound from my radio with the transmitter less than a foot away. what sound i did get was completly unlistenable. even if i followed the instructions on here to increase the signal 5x i doubt it would sound very good (and again, this is with the transmitter right next to the radio). now that i'm paying for shipping again to send it back, i'm not really saving any money buying the cheaper model anyway. lame :/"
1,Utterly useless...,"Bought it to send our satellite radio audio downstairs to our basement family room. Tuned it with a quality grundig receiver so I knew what the output frequency was supposed to be.the signal barely made it across the kitchen never mind down the steps.Might work if you are sending computer audio from in your lap(top) to a receiver near your lap.I paid the extra $'s because it was a ""c crane"".I'm very unhappy.There's plenty of web info about cracking the case open( voiding any warranty); and tweaking the power output up. I'm anexperienced RF electronics(radio) tech; understand it completely, but will not violate fcc regs.Pass on this particular transmitter."
3,Product has a quality control problem,I bought this product two or three years ago. It worked for a few days and then worked only at close range. I have access to an ace electronics technician who found that the mechanical movement of vr2 (that variable resistor) was loose and tightened it. It has worked like a charm ever since. This repair is not for everybody. I also told the company about it.
5,This book is great!,"I love the advice this book gives & it gives it in a fun, stylish & humorous way, which makes it hard to put down. There's tips in this book that are really valuable. Especially when it comes to social situations & how to get over heartbreak & be resiliant. Another thing about this book that I loved was it's compact size which makes it conveniant to carry around, especially when you're on vacation & you want a good read on the plane or by the pool. It was definitely worth the money I spent."
2,For younger girls only...,"This is a cute book with common sense advice for young girls. However, there is quite a bit of silly advice in here too, and it made me feel very old even though I'm still in my 20's! I think this would be a great gift for a new graduate who's starting to go out into the world on her own."
5,"Good, easy to use product.",I like this product: took a long time looking for a non-aluminum deoderant and am glad I found it.
4,fun dancy CD..,"this CD is actually not too bad.. contrary to come of the reviews.. some of the tracks are really good.. some are sort of ""meh"" but it's a fun CD to listen to. I am happy with the purchase which was done on a whim, and in the midst of many bad reviews.. It's got a great Oakie energy to it, and you can tell he got to touch most of the music on it.. PPK's ressurection and Chroma (long) are my fav tracks.."
4,Good Stuff,Although it looks very old when compared to new movies technologies but Its very nice.Regards
3,Poor quality recording,"The quality of this recording is very poor. Certain sections were so dark they were barely watchable. I owed this series on VHS years ago, and there were no problems."
5,A captivating love story,"Set in the times of the British Raj, this is a wonderful love story. The exotic places and events will certainly captivate the viewer. The actors like Ben Cross, Omar Shariff are simply great so is Amy Irving in her role as Eurosian girl."
5,Far Parvilions,"This was a HBO mini series and I was so glad to see Amaazon offered it on DVD. The quality was pretty good for as old as the movies was. Any one who like this original series, I would recommend it."
3,It's ok,"We have better leapster games, this one isn't bad but I find my 4 year old gets easily bored with it. Maybe it's just an age thing but he enjoys the Dora and Kai Lan games much more than Creature Create."
4,Seems fun given the game system,"My son recv'd this game and system for xmas when he turned 2.5. (yes young for this system but the price was right). He has played with it and is slowly learning more about it and how to make it work for him. The creature create is one of the games he actually plays. He seems to enjoy it. Given his age, the Mobigo system he also rec'vd is much more appropriate"
3,It's Ok.,"It's nothing special - my 5 y.o played it for a day or so and then put it aside for good. The game may be of certain interest for younger kids, perhaps, 4 y.o. Graphics are pretty much standard and of a good quality."
5,Perfect!,"I purchased a few Leapfrog games/educational games for my grandaughter to play with when she came to visit. She loved them! I couldn't get her to stop playing them unless I took it away. I did get her headphones to use while she was here so we (the adults) couldn't hear the noise when she played it in the family room. All in all, the 3 I chose were wondergul! She loved them ALL!"
4,Scary!,"I just had some very good friends move to Patti's area and they were the ones to turned me on to the book. I can't even imagine having to go through everything Patti did. She is one tough cookie in my book! During the read, it did become confusing at several times, but it all became crystal clear in the end."
1,"Listen to ""D. Schmidt"" below: don't bother with this one...","I am forced to give this flick 1 star Bcuz a ZERO is not an available option on this review section of Amazon.com.I wished I'd have read D. Schmidt's review before wasting $4.36 to rent this 14-minute waste of time (that's how long my DVD player took to fast forward thru this crap). I'm griping Bcuz I could've picked something else.But nooo, I had to pick this since I saw the R-rating for ""Strong Sexual Content"" <- Pahleeese! What sexual content? Where? Only in one's imagination, definitely NOT in this garbage. Oh sure, there's hugging, kissing, and I-P-L-I-E-D sexual activity (waaay off-screen, as in the next studio), but not in this!So, you now have at least 2 votes (mine and D. Schmidt's) to stay away from this one. But, if you ignore the warnings and go rent or buy this crap, well, you have been warned..."
3,Concern,Purchased for tent camping. Tried out before trip and all was well. While camping air pump died 1st night! Had to sleep on a mattress that was 1/4 full. Supplier informed us that Aero had a batch of bad pumps that went out and replaced it for me but took 4 weeks. Nice product but test more then once before you use it.
1,Don't waste your money!,I thought Aerobeds were great until I bought this one. Not only does It leak air continuously its squeaky if you move around on it. Maybe useful for those guests you don't want staying very long. I'd rather sleep on the ground.
4,Areo Bed w/ rechargeable pump,"The amazon part of my transaction went flawless.......Now the areo bed itself.....This is a great bed and is very well built and sturdy but the pump has a bad design flaw....It can only pump when the batteries are fully charged or plugged in to a car...IT WILL NOT PUMP FROM THE WALL AC UNIT!...stupid stupid stupid.......any way, the way around it is, buy a 12 wall converter that has a cigarette type female plug about one amp or so....my was 7.95 it's small enough to fit in the bag and it works like a champ....Now this unit can handle any situation!! This comment and a dollar will not buy you a cup of coffee!!!!"
1,Deception!,"I couldn't help myself but to point out that the review titled ""Sad Book"" posted by ""A reader"" is not a genuine review. It can only be an Armenian posing as a Turk who is apologizing to the Armenians while accusing the Turks. The Turkish names he used are not right, the spelling and punctuation erroneous. I advise the readers to disregard his deceiving review."
3,Passport to Heaven,"The book is written on simple level of understanding for ""Christianity 101."" I would not recommend this book for person wanting a depth of understanding about what Christ did for us by allowing Himself to be crucified for our unclean natures.OK, the book is a little too ""sugar coated"" for me. I know that much pain and suffering has gone into building Christ's True Church. Satan is real and he tries to destroy the True Church that lives inside each believer.Review by Richard W. Kelsey, PE and AuthorSearch Amazon.com to findPowerful Wisdom for Powerful Writing: Applying Ancient Teachings to Contemporary Writing"
3,Good compliment to other guides.,"Hiking California, the subject requires volumes considering all the opportunities here in California. This is a good book to have around, but mainly as a compliment to your other, more specific guide books. The hikes included are pretty well described, but the maps are too vague. California is a big state ... larger, better maps would really improve things."
5,Roomful of Rainbows,"A beautiful story with an important message. Roomful of Rainbows is one simple man's journey out of his plodding, punctual beaten down life, into self-awareness. He wakes to a feeling that there must be something other than what he's living with a wife who knows nothing but the negative side of things. He learns to hear, see, and feel life again. He also finds that with freedom comes responsibility. Robert W. Reagan is someone shielded from the harsh realities of life around him. Although well read and informed, he sees nothing on a personal level. Join him in his journey where he finds enlightenment, romance, and becomes an unexpected hero. I couldn't put it down."
1,movie not expose',"Thought we were getting footage of Maragona, it was a movie of his life. Didn't find it appropriate for young kids, but good moral lesson. Don't do drugs!!!"
2,kanji cards,"I will admit the cards are helpful, but for the price, not enough. I expected better quality and better kanji information. Yeah, buying them savse time, but making them saves money and I've found that when I write the cards myself, I learn the information better."
2,Paper flash cards? No way!,"I bought and used these flash cards when I completed RTK1. However, shortly after I finished I discovered the SRS (spaced repetition software) program 'Anki', and soon ditched the cards for good. Cards are awkward, messy, and a pain to use. Not only is an SRS convenient, but it is far, far, far, far more effective at helping you remember kanji, facts, anything. If you haven't yet tried using an SRS, I'd recommend you to go and download 'Anki' (search it on google), then download the shared RTK deck and give it a try. I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results."
2,Blazing Fast Intermittent Connection,"All my other non-USB wireless cards work fine with my D-Link DIR-655 Draft-N router. My DWA-142s both disconnect so frequently they are useless. They are 1 floor down and 20-25 feet over from the router. There is no other radio interference. (In the countryside, no other houses near, no 2.4MHz phones or other wireless routers, disconnects don't coincide with microwave oven use, powered through UPS to avoid electrical fluctuations, etc.) I do have similar intermittent connection problems with 2 other older USB wireless network cards. I have to conclude USB cards just don't get a reliable amount of power through the USB ports. I bought these hoping I wouldn't have to wire the bottom floor of my house, but I've wasted so much time trouble-shooting them and they both have the same problem so I'm giving up and returning them."
1,"not worth the money, very confussing","The answers to the questions are not correct, it is confussing, it does not give explanations on how to get the right answers. I'm not stupid but I don't agree with what this program says the answers are. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Pointless Potty Tray,"I would not recommend this product! You can just place the potty pad on the floor and get the same results! My dog actually likes to tug the potty pad out of the tray, but, when I place the potty pad on the floor, he does not mess with it!"
3,removal difficult,"I am somewhat disappointed. I bought this tray because of the generally good reviews, but I find that getting the frame off the tray is often difficult- breaks my fingernails :-). My dog used it right away, but I cannot leave it where she can get at it during the day because she tore out and tore up the pads. In addition, the instructions say it cannot be used out of doors and I wanted to put it on my terrace. I went to the website to get more information, but couldn't gain access.I gave it 3 stars because it is well made and because my puppy had no trouble using it."
2,A so-so account of Gn'R,"First I'd like to say I think Guns n' Roses were the greatest hard rock band ever; Kurt Cobain said they had no talent? Totally untrue. This book is shoddily written, especially the part about 1992, which kind of seemed to jump around. The author didn't mention that Gn'R got the MTV video vanguard award in September 1992, that's a big deal! Although Axl Rose is very interesting, I think the book would've been more balanced if there was more about the other band members. I do understand though, that Axl Rose is Guns n' Roses, in a sense. I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate being compared to Michael Jackson! I'm quite surprised that all the astrologers haven't gotten interested in Axl, being that he was born during the huge Aquarius stellium in 1962. Also, maybe there should have been more about Axl's bipolar disorder; that is a serious mental illness.Overall, the book wasn't that well-written, but if you feel you absolutely must know more about the band, it's an okay guide."
4,Good but not a lot new,"The Band That Time Forgot: The Complete Unauthorised Biography of Guns N' Roses is a good book.But for dedicated GnR fans, there is not a lot of new info here."
5,WE NEED A WORD FROM THE LORD - SING HYMNS,"THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL ALBUM THANKS TO PASTOR SHIRLEY FOR BRINGING US BACK TO WHAT IT USE TO BE LIKE IN THE CHURCH. I HEARD THESE SONGS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL ALSO,WITH MY GRANDMOTHER. THE 2 I LIKE BEST IS STEAL AWAY WITH MICHELLE WILLIAMS AND COME YE DISCONSOLATE SEEING HOW SHE FIT IN WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE SINGING IS BEAUTIFUL I LISTEN TO PASTOR SC ALL THE TIME MORNING,NOON & NIGHT. SEEING HOW THE LORD IS BLESSING HER WITH HER MUSIC MINISTRY AND REACHING THE YOUNG PEOPLE IS A BLESSING. I PRAY THE LORD WILL CONTINUE TO BLESS HER AND BISHOP WILLIAMS IN THEIR NEW CHURCH HOME. PASTOR SHIRLEY SINGS FROM THE HEART AND PUT ALL HER ENERGY AND GOD GIVEN TALENT INTO WHAT SHE DOES WHEN SHE PERFORM. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER SINGING HYMNS."
3,Ok...Is enough already enough?,Ok...I think that this one may have done it. I know that there is already a number 5 out and I would see it becuase I already know who the bad guy is and enough is enough already.This was one of those movies that they only made becuase they can still turn a profit with the Saw Brand Name.Do yourself a favor and buy Saw 1 and stop after that...
5,LOVE it!,"Im a huge saw fan, I buy all my saw dvd's on amazon, since I can't find any better prices any place else. Came brand new, packaged and sealed and LOVE it! These movies are awesome, finally a sick twisted movie with lots of sick torture, but with a continuing story line. Nice to finally watch a horror, that can put out a new movie almost every year, but the story always goes on, which is kind of nice. If you enjoy sick torture and gore and a good story, you can't beat the Saw movies! They are my favorite movies!"
5,good 4th movie in the series,im a fan of the saw series and this one was a worthy sequel to the other 3. they did a good job of tying the storyline together. i think it was better than 3 but saw 2 is still my favorite one. looking forward to #5
5,BluRay,"Another Saw thriller. What more can you say. If you like the Saw movies, you will like this one also."
3,actually decent,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by the storytelling element in this movie. While I think that the autopsy scene was a bit much, most of the movie was done pretty good. The only problem that I had was that they assumed the audience remembers every single character from the other movies. I really wish they would have done flashbacks near the end, because I was totally confused by what was going on at the end, and I felt the ending was rushed. Other than that, I enjoyed it and Jigsaw will be missed!"
1,Why Am I Watching This?,"This is the question that came to me as I watched the opening of this movie; There is something about a movie that relies heavily on showing dead bodies oozing guts, hanging on meat hooks, etc. to get the 'gore factor'; While some of the traps are somewhat interesting, I couldn't help feeling they were the left-over ones they didn't use from the previous movies...On the plus side, there are some cool story explanations for the die hard fans I guess. I felt the series was starting to slip a little in Saw 3, which I mostly did like along with the previous 2 movies. I won't speak about the acting only because there really isn't any to speak of. Or characters that aren't totally cookie cutter types. I would have to say that Saw IV is just really depressing overall in almost every imaginable way....I will never get that time back."
1,A serrated edge too far,"The problem with SAW IV is its arbitrariness and lack of cohesion. In an attempt to recreate the fiendish riddle-like qualities that worked so well in the first two movies, and passably well in the third, the filmmakers have stretched the premise too far. The story, such as it is, twists back on itself to such an extent that the chronology of events in the previous movies and those of this instalment become hopelessly confused. Add to this the annoyingly self-conscious jackhammer editing and you end up with an unsatisfying mess. I think I saw enough already."
5,Worth it!,"Have used this product in my Mazda Miata manual trans for over 50K miles with excellent results. Smoother, easier shifting, especially in cold weather, compared to OEM product. Highly recommended!"
4,Oswald Chambers book and CD - awesome content,The product was new and received it as promised. CD was a problem. Could not just insert and use. Had to call company on CD and could not get an answer. Googled the book and cd and found the Logos company software and called them several times to get the necessary codes etc to be allowed to use cd. Amazon needs to send code with book. Other than that Book content and CD are awesome.
5,another winner,"I can't begin to adequately describe this music. It's on another plane, far removed from any earthly matters. It is another example of musical brilliance caught on tape. Fred is in fine form, displaying power, endurance, and passion while spinning line after line of lyrical improvisation. William Parker is, as usual, brilliant. His bass is well recorded and is much more natural sounding than on some of his other recordings. Hamid Drake is perfect here...in sound and execution...a truly phenomenal drummer. The three musicians work together as one on this compelling performance, caught on tape at Johnson State college in Vermont.Fred Anderson fans....get this one as soon as you can!!!"
2,Poorly paced and poorly researched,"I won't give this book a paltry one star as others below have done. It's not at the bottom of the barrel, just close. The problem is that Perret is not an historian of the Civil War. He is not a Bud Robertson, Krick, McPherson or Gallagher. In order to write a good biography of Grant, you have to have a solid foundation of his military tactics and strategy. Perret doesn't have this and makes it obvious. The book is not badly written, I thought it was interesting in places. Maybe a bit overblown sometimes. There is no great biography of Grant which is surprising considering he was quite a fascinating fellow and horribly misunderstood. I think the people writing the reviews are fanatics on Grant and resent all the mistakes. I can scarcely blame them, the errors are outrageously numerous. I still think Bruce Catton's books, though 30 years old, still sparkle. This book does not."
1,MADE IN CHINA JUNK,"HAD THIS CAMERA FOR 1 YEAR, ONLY TOOK 25 PICTURES OF MY GRAND CHILDREN,WHO LIVE 775 MILES FROM ME,WENT BACK 7 MONTHS LATER, TOOK 10 PICTURES, & CAMERA QUIT. CALLED HP & GOT NO ANSWERS AT ALL, NOW I AM STUCK WITH A CAMERA & DOCK THATS NO GOOD FOR NOTHING. LAST HP PRODUCT I WILL EVER BUY."
5,FINALLY !!!,Finally a way not to spend $300 to determine ovulation. This unit works and costs nothing compared to the urine tests.I used the Ovulite for 60 days and I am expecting in October of this year.Thank you! Thank you!
1,Can't see a thing,"I bought this hoping it would help me know when I'm going to, or about to ovulate because I am very irregular.I followed the directions EXACTLY, and looked through the scope and could see nothing... no dots, no ferns. I tried it every day, and tried it when an ovulation predictor kit told me I was ovulating, and still saw nothing.It was a complete waste of money."
2,Inconsistent,"I am not going to say this product is worthless...It simply has given me very random results. One day it shows ferns, the next day none, then the following day ferns again. I would certainly not say it is 98% accurate."
1,piece of junk,I tried this one on the second day after my period is over. And it shows I am highly possible to get pregnant. Let's see how their customer service reacts...
1,Not an instrument.,Not a good first instrument. Very fragile. Does not keep in tune. Really a fragile toy not an instrument.
1,Keyboard and Mouse Pad fail,"This laptop has given me problems after 1month I got it. The keyboard and mouse pad simply do not respond. Mine is definetely a defective one. However, my complain is about Toshiba's customer service and technical support. I have not received proper answers, they kept me on hold for hours on the phone until they hanged up on me,.Took it to the tech. support three times, it worked after I brought it home for a while, then it went back to have the same problem until at one point the tech. representative told me He would start replacing parts randomly until He fixed the problem by chance becuase He did not know what the problem was. Be aware, that if you buy one of their computers you are likely to be stuck. Simply, Toshiba has the worse support I've ever seen (a surprise to me at the beginning, but will never buy toshiba again)"
1,So disappointing,"Is the problem the Toshiba or, like the previous reviwer said, is it Vista? I've had this for four days, and it has crashed three times. The first time I was reading my email. The second time I was trying to play Diablo II, a game that falls well within the specs of this system. Proceed with caution!"
2,for diehard fans,"This cd was created for the diehard Doors fan, if you are causal Doors fan or wanting to hear the Doors at their peak as a live act, you are better off with Live In Detroit or any of the other Bright Midnight releases. This is actually as the title of the cd suggests, a private Rehearsal from the most enduring band from the 60's, this cd is not bad if you listen to it in the spirit it was released, it neither adds nor detracts from Jim Morrison's legend but it is weakest of the Bright Midnight releases and would recommend this cd only if are a completeist or a die hard Doors fans that has a desire to own everything that has been released offically, which is why I own it."
1,Defective Hard Drive,"I purchased the model of this computer with a 60G drive July, and on December 5th the hard drive broke. It will not mount and makes grinding and clattering noises. I have lost data. This is not a quality product. I am now returning it to Sony (event#E26545346). I thought Sony made quality products and I paid a premium for their notebook compared to other notebooks and look at what I get. I am very unhappy. I wonder if this is more than just an isolated incident. I will never buy a Sony product again and do everything I can to stop others from buying Sony's products.So if you like your hard drive unexpectingly crashing and like to lose data then go ahead and roll the dice and buy this computer."
5,Excellent...,Excellent book...as a avid backpacker i was very impressed with the hiking/trail descriptions included...there a TONS of them...very good educational information about the dunes and the surrounding areas as well...I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to get a little more out of there dunes trip than a trip to the visitors center...while your there try and catch a sunset from atop the dunes!
2,"Great Camera, lousy software","I bought a C-740 3 weeks ago. Very nice camera, got the controls figured out, took about 100 photos. Really like the long optical zoom. At some magnification, the 740 has the impaoct of a >6Mpixel CCD because of the excellent lens.One HUGE problem just discovered though. The Camedia Master (and Pro option) software stinks! It looks like poorly done software from an asian source. Worst of all, the Olypus softrware cannot print to any networked printer. Every one of my other Windows applciations work just fine over the net. Olympus says, ""Gee, were sorry"" and that they have no plans to fix this major error.If you need to use this camera at the office or home with a printer that is not directly connected to your PC, pass on Olympus and look for another manufacturer! The problem is endemic to all Olympus cameras!"
1,Watch out!,"No ax to grind other than this case history. Bought an Olympus digi last year; one month past warranty it died; olympus service via web utterly unrepsonsive; many phone calls later they are saying things like ""try leaving it overnight and installing new batteries"" which i did many many months ago. Upshot: yours may not fold, of course, but mine sure did and the company is miserable with help, and after much pursuit on my part now is sending very high minimal repair fees they charge before even looking to see what's wrong. This is how a company convinces a consumer never ever to buy one of its products again."
5,A perfect first,"I recently just bought the Olympus C-740 and absolutely love it. The pictures are so crystal clear...once you auto focus, and the zoom is amazing. I bought it mainly for the zoom, since I like my pictures close up. It's super easy to use and printing off my PC is so simple with the USB cable. I didn't even need any software. I take my pictures on CD to the store and have them printed up, saves on the wear and tear on my printer along with the price of ink and paper. Definitely worth buying!"
2,"""Misquoted. . . ?""","I am appalled: If the aim of this book is to distill, it has done exactly that. I have found more than one misquote in this paperback. For example: under FRIENDS & FRIENDSHIP; the third quotation begins, ""Forsake not an old friend..."" and is attributed to ""Eccliesiasticus 9:10"". According to the New International Version of the Bible, Ecclesiastes 9:10 is, ""Whatever your hands find to do..."" and correlates in no way with friends and friendship. What else is wrong with The New International Dictionary of Quotations? Plenty. ""Ecclesiasticus""? Boo on you, Hugh."
1,Junior Chocolate Spiru-tein,"I was hoping my kids would like this, it has so many great ingredients. I have blended it with ice, blended with fruit, mixed with regular milk hoping they would think it was chocolate mild. They love chocolate milk so I added a scoop to their favorite chocolate milk, did not work. Then I added just a little bit to their chocoate milk (thining I could do this a couple times a day and then it would equal about a scoop). Even just a little bit added to chocolate milk they noticed and threw their cups in the sink after just one sip. No fooling them. I tried it and it is very chalky, even just a small amount in their milk was chalky. I really wanted them to like it."
1,Chocolate 5-Drawer Chest,"This has got to be the worst dresser ever made. I purchased this for my son because he was only 2 and I didn't want to spend too much money. In the picture, it looks like a nice dresser. I didn't have to worry about my son messing it up, it was a terrible product to begin with. It is made of particle board, and scratches and nicks extremely easy. To put the dresser together wasn't too hard, but the bottoms of the drawer continuously fall out, and I am having to pull the drawer out, put the bottom back on, and put it back in. I would NEVER buy this product again!!!"
1,worst product - very very hard to assemble,"This is the worst piece of furniture i ever bought. The instructions are awfully insufficient. You will spend hours figuring out n still I bet u cant finish it right. The thickness of each shelf base is a few milli meters .. what the *** they fail to disclose it in the product description. You can atmost put 3 tshirts in each, anything more will just bend those shelves to the floor. However you use, it will not last more than 1-2 months.My suggestion DO NOT BUY this crap. ignore this company itself."
4,5 drawer chest,"Overall, very nice. I think as long as you take your time putting it together, it will be great. The price is fantastic!I have a tendency to ""stuff"" drawers -- so far, so good. My advice would be to read all instructions very carefully (I actually put it together by myself) and you will end up with a good product for the money. No complaints and I would recommend for a single adult person or even in a guest room. I also purchased the nightstand and it is working very well. I may buy the matching dresser. Go for it."
2,Okay for the price,"Instructions were not as clear as i thought they should be.Resulted in me, my boyfriend and dad arguing about what the diagram really means. (We were all wrong)The dresser leans to whatever side the wind blows. We had to add screws just to keep it together. I have had the completed the dresser for a week now and still haven't put any clothes in it for fear or it collapsing."
5,An eye-opening visual survey,"Sin-A-Rama: Sleaze Sex Paperbacks of the Sixties is a full-color gallery of paperback cover artwork from ""sleazy"" sex-themed paperback books of the 1960's. An introduction surveys the industry and history behind such publications, but most of the text within Sin-A-Rama consists of excerpts from the paperbacks themselves. The covers, done in the realism style with muted shades so common in the 60's, are often quite revealing; bare breasts and nipples are not uncommon, as are a number of kinky, if exaggerated situations. An eye-opening visual survey of the sensuality marketed to popular American culture during the era of the sexual revolution."
2,discipline dependant,The clear cut discipline categories embraced by this book leave little for those searching in any specific manner. Highly limiting categories which are all becoming mute in the increasingly interdisciplinized academy and serve to equilize highly different programs. I was quite dissappointed.
3,Good but not great,"This anthology was mixed. There were a couple of very good stories in it, and some that lacked enough imagination to give more than a quick read before moving on to the next one. If you're looking for some escape fiction to pass the time, interspersed here and there with noteworthy ones, get this volume. But be warned ahead of time that the quality is not consistent."
5,Superb book on several fronts...,"Earley was trying to write a history of turpentining. What he ended up with was a spectacular essay on the natural history of longleaf pine forests, the human history of the forested south, an essay on conflicting views in forestry, and....oh yes...turpentine!Reading this as an ecologist, I found everything I wanted with just enough of the human element to flesh it out without boring me. Oddly enough, I suspect those reading this from an anthropological view have the same opinion about the natural history aspect of the book. Earley is that good in weaving his tale.It flows well, is well organized, and the research and references are stunning. Twenty-three pages of references make me wonder how he ever finished the book. (In his acknowledgements he seems to wonder the same thing himself!)This book belongs on the shelf of every forester, ecologist, and southern historian. I'm just thankful I stumbled across it on a rainy day in Congaree National Park."
2,Forgettable,"Chose this vid to see Paddy Considine's acting work. Watched it one & 1/2 times. Movie is slow, confusing & has no asset that that drew me in to the story. Consider Considine's directorial debut with 'Tyranosaur'. Though dark & vicious, it is an excellent film."
5,A short review.,I found the book complet and comprehensive and recommend it without reservation.Bon apetit
3,I have the ICP 21 Amp and 7 Amp charge controllers,"I don't know how this product compares but I have developed an opinion on this product. I have it charging a backup batteries from solar panels. I had trouble with it draining the batteries at night. It cost me over $200 in ruined batteries. I finally realized that it was draining the batteries and went to radio shack, bought a rectifier diode so it could only charge and not discharge through the ""charge controller"". The rectifier diode was rated for 50 amps but it passes any positive current without clipping to charge the battery. It fixed the problem but really... I should not have had to do that. Otherwise it works fine. If already use one of these, I highly recommend the diode to cut down on losses."
3,go with the maclaren,wheels are cheap and it is not compact when folded I would go with the maclaren instead. I have both and now we never use this one
1,Will ruin your Chicco Keyfit 30!!!,"This product is NOT compatible with the Chicco Keyfit 30, as it is advertised!I went to have my car seat inspected, and the tech found two stress marks in the shell of my daughter's car seat. We quickly realized that they are from the Baby Trend Snap N Go, from the front tabs that the seat rests on. The damage done to the car seat Is not merely cosmetic - it compromises the safety of the car seat.In all fairness, I double checked the instruction manual to make sure I had not used the product incorrectly. I hadn't. Now I have to buy a new car seat because of their false advertising!The car seat tech supervisor recommended I ask Baby Trend to pay for it. Who knows if THAT will happen..."
4,Good stroller,"I bought this stroller because I didn't want to take my baby in and out of the car seat while she was still small. I love this snap n go!! It's light weight, easy to fold up and fits easily into the back hatch of my Toyota Matrix. It has a large storage compartment on the bottom.... but it can be hard to get to with the baby seat in place. I hang my diaper bag on the handle and have not had anymore issues. My little girl is 4 weeks old and we use this stroller on a daily basis because I had a C-section and can't carry the baby seat very far. So far it has held up very well, even on uneven concrete. I am also using a basic Graco-Snugride car seat, which is not listed as compatible, but fits exactly how it should into the stroller."
2,WARNING - NORMAL MOUNTING GEAR NOT INCLUDED,"I ordered three of these from Music 123 and only after receiving them did I learn that they do not supply the mounting equipment (crews, drywall toggles, padding) that String Swing includes in its packaging. In the past I have had great experiences ordering vertical String Swing guitar wall mounts from Amazon; they came with all the equipment and padding necessary to quickly mount the hanger. This order sent me on a hunt to the hardware store.Otherwise, hanger looks good."
1,Big embarassment to all Mariah fans.,A true Mariah fan would never try to record any of her songs and try to sell as a tribute to her. This so called album is more like an embarassment than a tribute. Mariah derseves more respect than that. From us true Mariah fans who have respect we apologize for this so called tribute album.
1,Ain't nuthin' like the real thing!,"Since 1990, the music world has had the meaning of breaking records redefined by an artist that not only can write the hits, but sing them as well (okay that's an understatement; she sings them beyond astonishment). Sadly when the makers of her tribute album picked a vocalist to highlight Carey's hit, they had a big miss.The ""Tribute To Mariah Carey"" LP is nothing more than a sad attempt to capitalize on an artist who can belt out a tune like no other. No, I'm not mad at this album. I'm glad they wanted to tribute her, but why pick a unknown singer (the term singer is used loosely) who can't sing and who can't even hit Mariah's trademark notes (ie, ""Emotions"", the song where Mariah redefine high notes, the singer on this LP doesn't even come close to hitting this note).Let's hope the makers of this cd never have a tribute to Aretha Franklin, who will they pick, Britney Spears?"
1,The perfect gift for someone you hate,"I listened to the sample tracks earlier today, and couldn't believe that anything could be so horrible.To give an educated review, I decided to trek to the local used store, and see if they had it. Not surprisingly, they did -- but it was hard to find, because it was hidden with the $1.99 CD's. (Don't believe me? Go to Switched On CD's in Novi, MI and see for yourself.)So, I took it for a test drive in the store's CD player. Luckily, they had headphones, because I'd be embarassed beyond belief if anyone saw me listening to this.Beyond being a total assault to your ears, and a complete insult to anything Mariah Carey has done, this CD actually made me wish I was deaf.I'm quite certain that you could go to any junior high school, and pick a random girl out of the choir class, and STILL have a rough time coming up with something worse than this....."
5,Excellent book that gives you hope!,"This book helped me realize the importance of prayer and believing that your prayers will be answered. I also could relate to the testimonials given in the book. I shared this book with one other person and because of that others went out and purchased the book, a ""pass-it-on"" effect, if you will. This book by Quinn Sherrer has given many people hope and the ability maintain faith."
1,Still haven't received this a month later!!!,"Had to tick a star to proceed. AS ABOVE!!! No update, no explanation; only requests to review an item I have not received. Don't know what the problem is here but, if out of stock, I should've been notified."
2,WHAT HE GOING ON ABOUT?,"Does Prager really know anything about Judaism? He claims to be a scholar of the ""Torah"".He irritates when he has the audacity to tell Christians about their own Faith. He wants to tell Bible believing Christians that their Jesus would love to see Tookie Williams executed. Can y'all believe this guy?!"
5,Great Introduction,"This little number is great for an individual who has little knowledge of Judaism. Displays in a readable way the differences between Christianity and it's parent faith; Judaism. Great read for anyone wishing an introduction into a very misunderstood faith, especially looking on from an outsider."
5,Brief Introduction to Buddhism,"Buddhism is a subject that has spawned a huge and bewildering number of books, all meant to encourage the Westerner in understanding its message and way. Like the other volumes in the VSI series, this book provides a succinct introduction into a field in general, highly readable outlines. There is a short bibliography for further study, as well as a timeline; both of these help in placing the historical and religious aspects in perspective. It is also very clear in setting out the demands of Buddhism on adepts in the 21st century. As a starting point, this slim volume points theway to the Way. Highly recommended."
2,Not impressed,"Changed my manual transmission fluid with this in hopes that it would improve shifting and shifter feel. While there's been a definite improvement in shifting when warm, it performs horribly in the cold - far worse than the OEM dino fluid. For the first 5 miles it's like I'm shifting through peanut butter and gravel. Definitely going with something else next time."
2,"reads like a diary, no substantial information",This is a book to read if you want a story and not to get any information. I really could care less what she eat for breakfast. I was expecting it to be more informative and intelligent. Ms. Beard should stick to writing children's stories.
5,You'll roar! And you don't have to be Catholic to laugh!,This is English-Irish Catholic humor at its best. Pre-Vatican 2 antics that we love laugh at!
2,Disappointing,"Let me begin by complimenting the skills of this 14 year old. Very impressive to know that the author was so young. However, it is VERY obviously written by somebody who is inexperienced. I think the book could have turned out MUCH better had she co written it with her editor. I walked away with so many questions. There are 2 stories within one story and they don't mix well. The characters could have been developed a bit more. Actually there was so many characters that I wanted to learn more about but she didn't give enough of a description. Lots of fluffy words --- she definately gets an A+ for her use of adjectives. Lots of gaps!!!! Great to show kids as an example of what they can accomplish however you can spend you money on something better."
4,Pretty Good,"I think this book is really good, despite what all the other reviewers say. The story was original, the characters where well thought out, though a little stereotipical. The story seemed to flow, and kept a good pace. The world of Fairytale was good, with lots of imagination going into the landscaping and the inhabitants. The story of our three main girls, Jade, Amber and Opal, ties in with a story of a girl in present day Paris, who is dying, though it is never explained from what. These parts of the book are the most confusing, and are hard to keep up with. This all ties in to a very satisfing ending, which seems to make sence of all that has happened, and really makes you wonder. All in all, a great book, one of the best I have read in the genra. Worth reading, at least."
3,Little disappointed,"I'd always heard Pfaltzgraff was the way to go in dishes, but we only had these a few years before they started getting lines (looks like pencil marks) all over them. They look old and gross. I called Pfaltzgraff, and they said it's a reaction between flatware and the glaze and it happens all the time. They sent a cleaner for it, but you have to leave it sit for 8 hours or so and redo it every few months to keep them looking new."
3,Tales of Terror and Mystery,"There were some good stories, but I guess I've become hardened by the current terror movies and books that this seemed pretty tame. Imagine that it was scary stuff before people became used to gore etc."
2,confusion,I placed order on amazon items never shipped swanson did not have a record of the transaction waited two weeks then canceled the order. I later ordered the product directly from swanson which arrived in 3days I was pleased with the service until I received another invoice for items I did not order! Swanson customer service canceled the 2nd order but I still wonder how they were able to process a second order without my consent (Swanson claim that 2nd order made through Amazon but there are no records on Amazon)!Good product fast shipping but caveat emptor buyer beware.
2,"a few good poems, but generally pseudo-formal","The opening poems in this collection, the more recent ones, gave me reason to think I wouldn't continue with the book, for they consisted of pseudo-formal poetry at its most representative. Line breaks and stanzaic patterns had completely lost touch with meaning and content. After these poems, the collection improves, at least marginally. Every now and then a rhymed or off-rhymed piece appears, and many poems use either a loose pentameter or a free verse line of which, as Theodore Roethke would say, one can see the ghost of formal verse lurking behind it. Pinsky uses assonance and consonance to enrich his lines; concrete imagery and language are plentiful, which will please readers who look for this feature first and foremost; but few lines herein are really memorable. Still, I would single out poems like ""Shirt,"" ""Icicles,"" and ""From the Childhood of Jesus"" as noteworthy ones."
1,"Pedantic, pompous, pretentious","Pinsky's poetry is, alas, too much like his public persona: [see summary line]. When reading his poems, one feels lectured to, condescended to. As if poetry were solely about the display of ""knowledge."" But Pinsky's poetry does not pass the first test of good writing: to be interesting. His lame use of forms does nothing for his poems, and his continuous reliance on identifiable subject matter makes for tedious verse.Those who admire the discursive style in poetry might like Pinsky's essays in verse (for these ultimately are not poems but essays). Those looking for more friction and frisson within and between the lines should look elsewhere."
4,"Bloody Hill, the battle that saved Missouri for the Union","Bill Brooksher is a retired USAF Brigadier General. He writes in a style that showcases a brilliant mind and his dry humor. Bloody Hill began the Civil war in the west. It provided the Union with its first hero, BGen Nathaniel Lyon. Bloody Hill captures the drama of the era in Missouri. It is an insightful review of the intrigue that characterized the border states. Bloody Hill is a valuable addition to the sparse literature on the American Civil War in the west."
5,What I Ordered,"Hard to find chargers for one year old phones (does this make no sense to anyone else other than the phone companies that keep using different plugs for each phone?), but this one was great. Quick delivery too."
1,"Sorry, it's edited.","The continuing struggle of censership...Hey, if you don't want your kids to watch it, don't let them! I have no problem with dubs. However, the changing of lines from the original Japanese version and the edited scenes is just plain wrong. Dragonball Z is violent and has swearwords. Would everyone please accept that fact. Just because we are the richest country in the world doesn't mean we can change other people's arts.Bye the way, I wish I could have given this video a zero."
1,useless book,"The title should really read ""microsoft visual c++ 6.0 master reference"". My immediate impression is, it is going to be obsoleted as soon as microsoft releases vc++ 7.0. My questions; 1) is it really worth spending over 1500 pages just to all the syntaxes? Like the same author does in his other useless book ""visual basic master reference""? 2) Can the auther writes something a little bit of more valuable to the readers in the world?"
1,A straight up disappointment!,"Dis nigga is weak! Da only song good from him wuz the single 'pump it up'. I betcha he ain't goin' no where wit the lyriks he has. Anywayz if u want sumthin' betta, u minus well check out my man david banner, and three six mafia 'cause they come up with dat hard stuff all the time. I'm out!"
1,If wack were a crime he'd be locked up,"Joe budden please go away. You are a over hyped wack rhymer. Rah Digga said it the best when Joe was crying about not getting the respect he feels he deserves. Rah said plain and simple ""he is a B@tch"""
4,Joe Nice Debut,"Joe Budden has put out a very nice debut album. He doesnt try to be too gangster and pimp like the other rappers and just raps about his life and what he feels like. I just hope he doesnt sell out and start acting all pimped out in the next few years. Best tracks - 2,3,5,6,9,10,12,17.All in all,very,VERY nice debut. I really liked this one because, like i said before,its real, and he doesnt try to be something hes not. Right now,he is the least fake rapper out there. There was a small lack of guest appearances on this cd,but,he DID feature Busta Rhymes,who is my favorite rapper, on #9 (Fire), so its all good. Lets hope his next cds are just as good."
2,Overrated,"I'm originally from Jersey so I was predisposed to like this album. I've been hearing JB for the past two years on mix tapes and I liked the single ""Pump it Up."" But this record is just not very good. In fact, I can't really think of one good reason why you should go buy this record. The beats are overproduced and under-whelming and while JB's lyrics are not terrible but they are not really exceptional either.. JB has this nasal drone and very little elasticity in his voice and while JB's definitely got his own style it's just not all that inspired or inspiring. Just listen to one track, any track, with the exception maybe of ""Take a Walk With Me"", and that's what you are going to hear, that same nasal mumble. Def Jam made a mistake doing big cash promotion for this record. The money should have been spent on Keith Murray. JB is not a bad MC but he's closer to average than good."
5,THE BEST THING OUT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,JOE BUDDEN IS TRULY THE NEW BEST THING OUT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!HE CRAZY LYRICALLY WAYS AND THIS HIGH ENERGY ALBUM WILL PUT JOE BUDDEN TO THE TOP WHERE HE NEED TO BE AT. THIS ARTIST IS VERY CREATIVE AND TRULY THINK THAT EVERYBODY SURE GET THIS CD.
3,not bad,"its a good band; however, i was only happy with a few songs. a little bit disappointed and wasn't what i expected."
5,Jerzey's Back and better than ever!!!!!,Joe Budden's cd is hot and with his uncoming cd coming out you know you can expect the beast from the east to spit his best. Me being from Jerzey I am proud that he is from my home state. He already proved himself on mixtapes and in my opinion and he proved it he is better than one of the best selling artist today. Who you ask? 50 cent of course. He dissed the whole g-unit camp including ex-member game and he destroyed. But whatelse would you expect. So for everyone who thinks that Budden's rhymes are weak because he didn't sell millions and millions of records. I challenge you to buy his new cd which is in stores soon. But first buy this one so you won't be left out when his name is coming out of everyones mouth.
2,One of the wackest Cd's of the year by Kathi's Son,"This Joe Budden album is wack as hell and his producing unit is horrible most of the beats on here is wack by his gay producer White Boy. Don't get me wrong but Joe Budden can flow but over half his album is wack it wasn't what I expected the only WB beat that was tight is Focus. All the Just Blaze beats were sweet than a mug. There are only four tight songs on this album Pump It Up, Focus, Fire feat. Busta, and Give Me Reason. All the rest is garbage I'd rather burn this ... from a friend for 3 bucks. Joe let me give you advice, have most of your beats done by Just blaze, have one beat produced by WB and find a poroducer who can do beats. I couldn't listen to that wack material hook up with heavyweight producers. Or hook up with a real producer , Me!"
2,A true dissapointment,"If you want to use your brain do not buy this album. When ""Pump It Up"" was first played I loved it, it was a hit. I figured I would buy the album because I figured that the other songs on the album would be just as good. Don't get me wrong a couple of songs are good including ""Pump It Up"" and ""Porno Star"" but other than those two and one or two more are pretty good. Other than that the album [is bad]. It is a vastly overrated album sung by an overrated rapper. To me Joe Budden can be categorized as a one hit wonder...."
3,Enjoyable Film,"Great story, great acting, and filmed well. The story was engrossing although it lost me at a few points here and there. A couple of the plot choices just left me going ""huh?"". The film overall was definitely enjoyable. No scares, but a great atmospheric suspenseful piece.The final few minutes felt tacked on and didn't belong. It really should have been left out."
1,You can get a much better deal!!,This screwdriver does its job but you can get something similar for a lot cheaper. Keep on looking. A quick google search will lead to the same thing for only $1 or $2 shipped!! I found this out after I bought this item
4,thnx,"look like new, thnx. I have looking for this one for a month, but finally I got it.I will buy another books from you if I need it"
1,Not happy.,"They came fast, and as ordered. However, I realized I made a mistake with this order. The handles are rubber, and with over 100 pds to hold that's VERY precarious. There are no wheels on the case, which is also a hassle, but the worst was yet to come. The case did NOT hold my turntables in snugly at all. There was around 4 inches of space on my Technics, and my 10 inch mixer had around an inch of moving space. The picture showed a perfect fit for my technics, IDENTICAL to the ones in the picture. But they did not fit. It's a hassle to return, so I chose not to. But seriously Odyssey? I know it's a very cheap case, but I would have hoped it would come like it was shown, AT LEAST."
4,General Introduction...Worth Owning,"Percy Blandford writes on a lot of shop craft topics and has clearly thought about them a lot. He writes well. This is a general introduction to metalwork primarily from a smithing perspective...that is, carbon steel work. It touches on other areas but really isn't suitable to the beginning welder, sheetmetal worker, or tool and die hobbiest. It would be best for the person who wants to make historic replica items from a forge who one who wishes to supplement historical replica woodworking with some basic metal work in brass or iron/steel."
4,Buddhism for Drunkards,"Knipfel's memoir opens with one of the best opening lines that I've ever read: ""Whenever I hear the word 'spiritual,' I reach for my revolver."" I thought, ""Hell yeah,"" and continued to nod my way through the rest of the book. The book is a sort-of spiritual awakening (of the non-religious variety). Jesus only makes one appearance--riding a horse and swinging a giant flaming sword.The writing style is loose and friendly, like a good conversation over beers at a dive bar...and there are plenty of beers and dive bars in the book's brief 235 pages. ""I don't even want to think about the condition of my liver,"" Knipfel says in the introduction. After reading Knipfel's three memoirs, his liver is probably the least of his worries. Thankfully, he's still alive and kicking, and shows no signs of slowing his writing or drinking."
2,Materials are low quality,"I have had the same bad experience with these weights as Art van Law - the ""tube pockets"" in which the weights are carried are wearing through and the velcro fasteners are tearing off. I have had these weights for approx six months and use them at the gym about four times a week. After about two months I noticed a surprising amount of wear on the bottoms of the weight pockets, and a month later, the velcro strips started tearing off.Overall, the quality of the materials is extremely low and I expect the weights to be completely unusable within another month or two. Very surprising given the reputation of Everlast (truly a misnomer in this case.)"
2,"Everlast? alas ""No""","I bought these about 10 months ago and thought initially that they were well made and comfortable. However, like 2 of the previous reviewers, I have had a similar problem of wear and the weights falling out of the bottom, much to the amusement of other members of the excercise class. This is due to friction at the end of the metal weights that are sharp and cut the fragile material. Maybe it would be possible to reduce the wear by wrapping the end of the weights in masking tape. It is a shame that Everlast do not have website where we could feedback as these have not been well designed and they need to know."
2,"Movie files are ""Quick Time"" Don't Need it.....",Nice pictures. I don't have much to compare this too. The camera is complicated to master. A lot of settings. My big complaint is that the movies files the camera produces are only playable with QUICK TIME. I don't use quick time .... I don't want to use quick time. I use Media Player. You can not load these .mov files into Power Point. Bummer. It is crazy for a company these days to produce something like that. My opinion is that I would not buy another one.
5,Lovely,"This is a lovely necklace. It is well represented by the picture. It manages to be trendy without being overbearing. I was concerned when I first wore it that it would twist on the neck and not lay flat, but this was not the case. It will be a welcome addition to my jewelry collection, as I'm sure it will be to yours."
2,Disappointed with the size,"The necklace is nicely made, but the rectangles are very small and I am disappointed with this. This is probably a child's necklace rather than an adult one. Had I known the sizes of the rectangles, I would have not bought this necklace. However, as it was not expensive I am keeping it as a future present."
5,I love this CD!!,"I am a big Ray Boltz fan. My ex-boss is the one who introduced me to his music. She brought one of her tapes for me to listen to and that one tape has made me one of his fans. He is great!! Sometime I would love to hear him in concert. His songs are very moving, I can't image how moving he'd be to see in concert. I would like to find his Christmas CD."
1,Despicable Piece of Trash,"Words fail to describe this angry, sarcastic, cynical hate-laden piece of garbage. The only good thing about the Golden Globes and Julianne Moore winning is that it was the last time we'll hear the hateful garbage from that has-been actress who is relegated to remaking things like Carrie."
5,Demythologizing the Desert,"Very, very good book about author's 1990(?) trip from Algiers south through the Sahara desert into Niger, Mali and Senegal. He has apparently spent a fair amount of time in Algeria and had been to much of the Algerian desert prior to the trip he recounts in this book (actually, many of the anecdotes he tells are from previous trips). He nicely mixes in digressions on science (physics of sand dunes, ecology of scorpions, desertification) with his history and sociology. Langewiesche seems particularly keen to de-romanticize the Sahara, and spends a great deal of time chiding the French for doing so. A nice travel book which captures the terror of the desert quite well. I recommend not reading on once he exits the Algerian desert. He speeds through the final portion of the trip and has taken to heart the writer's adage that no ending is better than a bad ending!"
5,Bought in 2013 with expiration 2017,"The ones I bought came from Best Deal Supply in Jan 2013. Ordered two 3 packs but got 3 two packs which is the correct total number of batteries. They came in just a few days and according to the Energizer website, the date code of GZR expires in 2017. Tried three and found they all worked well in the devices I have. I'm happy and have already ordered from Best Deal Supply again because this about 1/3 of what you would pay at the corner drug store."
5,Energizer batteries,"The batteries arrived in a timely manner, and compared to the dollar amount for them at radio shack, this was a super bargain. These were for an animated children's book and so far, it is still working perfectly. Thanks!"
1,Fair- came not in a package,A little disappointed in the arrival of the batteries as individual batteries without the full original package. Although sealed in a selofan type package not sure these are originl or used. Doubtful will order again via Amazon.com
4,As ordered,Ordered from Trend Marketing. Newly dated batteries in packaging as shown.Came in a few days. No complaints for this vendor.
3,I would have to agree,"I would have to agree with some of the other reviews. This isn't what kind of stuff they do, its just a lot of posing and suggestive posing. However knowing Playboy did we expect any different, I didn't. However this isn't top-notch Playboy fare. A couple of the sequences have absolutely horrendous looking chicks. You can tell this was a patch job from already published scenes. There were a couple (mind you a couple) of good scenes. A shower scene in a locker room with an entire, we'll say cheerleading squad, cleaning each other (like thats what you'd see in a real locker room) and others including a nude car wash blah blah blah. If you just are looking for something else to look at, sure go ahead and get it. However if you're looking for super raunchy girl-girl action with first-class music, keep looking."
4,I would never be without this product again.,"I drink a lot of tea. Yerba Matte, Red, Green, ginger, etc. You name it - I drink it. I Purchased the 9205000 for my Mom for her birthday and she really enjoyed it. So I got one for myself!I was constantly opening and shutting my kitchen window because I was constantly starting the gas burner to make a pot of tea. It got annoying and I am sure that they gas burning in the house, even with the window open, is not the healthiest thing for you (FDA says indoor pollution is worse that outdoor).The 9205000 boils very quickly, in stainless steel, with no fumes. Plus the steel helps keep the remaining water nice and hot.The only negative (to me...) is the plastic top and screener. I would like that to be steel or, in the case of the screen, possibly even non-existent.That said, it is a good looking appliance that works well. I am looking forward to year of usage and 1000s of cups of tea!"
4,Karavans,"I've never read a book by Roberson and had only gave this one a chance because it kept coming up as a recommendation in Amazon. Honestly, the cover and blog did not grab me. The fact that it had such high reviews did.Overall, I think the book was wonderfully written, with well defined characters and setting. As a matter of fact, I was overly intrigued by the story line and had a difficult time putting the book down. On the down side, it was a terrible let down for me because the book had a fabulous conflict and climax, yet was completely lacking in a resolution. I feel as though I've read an incomplete book."
3,CoQ10,This product was fine but we needed the gel tabs instead of the powder so it wasn't exactly what we were looking for.
4,Purchased for grandson,My six year old grandson seems to really iike this pop up book. There are many tabs and items to move and view.
2,Do not buy this book,"Do not buy this book. There are so many script examples in this book that do not work, let alone there are many weak and sloppy algorithms and code logic structures the author introduced. If you already bought this book, see his script example in Chapter 13 (A Sample Authentication Implementation), try to read line by line in his Cookie class example, can you find any flaw? Well, there are many them in this tiny/simple class, but i can just ignore and pretend to think that the author did not have enough time to test his own scripts before he put them in his book...but the algorithm/logic structures of the codes that bothers me! Weak algorithm, bad code control structure can lead to a buggy application that is not easy to debug!"
3,So-so,"I liked this book and didn't! While it is well-written, far better than most novels of this ""ilk,"" it becomes quite redundant with the repetition of scenes told from four different points of view. Problem is, the points of view aren't all that different, so it is like reading the same chapter over and over again.I liked the story though and it held my attention until the end. I value Cherry's writing skills and use of words and images. It is certainly refreshing after having read so much drivel recently!"
4,Jodi Ann Paterson- yow!!,"You get about 35 minutes of Jodi- fantastic body, long auburn hair, great smile, expressive eyes. She oozes sex AND humor in her scenes. You see her dancing around campus in various states of undress, doing a little post-newscast show, playing off Playboy gear and clothes, showing off a Corvette (hard to tear your eyes off her though) and in a scene as a rich woman living her fantasies. Great camera work, music better than Playboy's usual (with one bit set to ""Blue Danube Waltz""). Yow again!The rest of the DVD is Brooke Richards- too blonde and buxom for my taste, but great material nevertheless. Who would have guessed she's a professional swimsuit model?Wish there were more Jodi- but what there is is fantastic."
3,Ok werewolf story,"Peter Slant is a werewolf hunter. At a young age he watched a werewolf with a white arrowhead on it's chest destroy his parents. He vowed to have his revenge on every werewolf he could find. As a man, he leads a discreet group around the world of werewolf hunters.This book has a lot of description to it, excessively so. I enjoyed the story but got tired of each characters movement explained. It seemed like the author was trying to make the book longer by adding way too much description."
2,dull,"I love international films and I was very excited to see this acclaimed one on the shelf of my local video store. How disappointing! I did not find myself interested in any of the characters or their stories- however tragic or deceitful. I struggled to watch it to the end and then I was terribly upset with myself for staying up. I tried to give it a chance to unfold the way the story was portrayed in the description- no such luck.I will say that the idea of examining the unraveling of secrets between two seemingly ""normal"" people in times of turmoil is an interesting one but it is not presented in the most effective way in this film."
2,Nope. Not for me.,"This is either a movie that's going to grab you and you're going to watch it obsessively for clues or it's...not.I watched about a half hour of it and started scanning and fast forwarding. I'm sure all the ambiguous scenes of cars and people hanging out on streets and empty streets have great meaning and that those that watch the thing for these clues can be shocked and amazed. Frankly, I was just bored silly. The guy is receiving tapes. He's receiving more tapes. He's getting cards. He's having dreams. Someone confronts him. He claims that he doesn't feel guilty. Big deal.The main character can't even yell at an idiot bike messenger without backing down and showing his tail. I hate these characters. I'm bored with their predicament and any tension I might feel is for a world gone mad with love of stupid movies."
1,uneven experitment in existensialist film making,This movie was and uneven experiment in one person's movie making.
1,I think the paint is dry now,"For those who like long, endless shots of the exteriors of buildings. All others should stay away."
3,ok sleeze!!,"This is ok,but if your into sleaze,I would get wildside ""under the influence"",or vain's no respect.D'moll's s/t is also a gem.This is in theranks of slik toxic."
2,"Running Wild's first ""pirate"" album is still their worst.","This album was of course Running Wild's transition album. They went from being a terrible band about rebellion through Satanic worship to a fun band about pirates and epic storytelling. Unfortunately, Under Jolly Roger is one of their weakest albums overall. Repetitive choruses, poor riffs, weak solos, and bad overall recording quality make this album a real pain to listen to. Really if you're looking for a good start to your Running Wild collection, start with ""Pile of Skulls"" or ""Black Hand Inn"". Their sound really didn't become listenable until 1988's ""Port Royal"", and didn't become truly legendary until ""Death or Glory"""
3,"fun to read, not so sure about the math!","i liked reading this book from the historical point of view. it kind of tells you the names of people who started a business and how things went belly-up for a while. the investment methods presented are very basic and fun to read. i think i can trust my math, however, i am not sure how michael added up his percentages. he has tables of total returns all over the book. looking at any one of them and for example on pages 193-194, how did he come up with such cumulatives ? if he totaled each column separately and got the numbers. then the added sums are incorrect."
3,"this is a GL5 product, not suitable for manual transmissions calling for GL4","Description doesn't state - this is a GL5 product, not suitable for manual transmissions calling for GL4. Make sure you order the right stuff."
4,Tom & Candy Green,"Good album. For the folks listening to today's gospel music, it may sound rudimentary, but this album speaks volumes to the heart. Songs have words and music, and their words were so powerful. Tom played both the guitar, and the piano, and played them well.I knew Tom & Candy, went to church with them, heard their concerts. They were very real people, living out their Christianity in the day to day world. Their testimony of a restored marriage has stayed with me forever.Tragically, Tom went home to be with the Lord early, by our standards. In a country with socialized medicine, he passed away waiting for his turn to have a surgical procdure that would have been without delay in America."
4,Another Near Miss,"You know those second-rate symphony conductors who start their careers with a combination of moxie, hard work, and a couple of good breaks? Check in on them twenty years later and they have become craftsmen enough that they are actually turning in some half-way decent performances. And yet... And yet the poetry is still not there. That is the Stephen King of ""The Green Mile."" Man, what a great story. But why isn't it singing? It can be Deep -- especially in Part 6 -- but it keeps missing the Heights. Give me something fleeting, something poignant, something almost ineffable. Poetry. Poetry isn't ""not for all the tea in China, as we used to say back in those days."" Tell me more about your sorrows, Paul Edgecombe, because I want to hear as much as you care to tell. A more talented author could have made me cry. But hey, how 'bout that Frank Muller? Is that great reading, or what?"
3,Just okay,"I've seen the movie, and loved it. I've read many of King's books and loved them. And, I read so many 5 star reviews of this book, I expected it to be another great addition to my library. Sadly, I found it to be very boring. I did not care for or about any of the characters. I found the whole thing with the mouse confusing and annoying. Who cares about a mouse? I didn't. I tried to care about the mouse, but I kept just wishing those scenes would be done. I finally skimmed through them. I was overall, disappointed. Guess my expectation of a great, asborbing, charactter driven story were too high. The only thing it had going for it, was King's ability to turn a phrase and paint vivid descritpions, but honsetly, it just wasn't enough to carry this book from mediocricy to stardom for me."
3,"An Ok Story, But Over-rated","I enjoyed this one well enough. It was extremely dull and hard to get into toward the beginning, but picked up a bit by the end. I definately would not consider it the great work everyone else seems to think it is, though. I appriciate it for what it is, and am glad King did the serialization expieriment (though I read it all in one volume.) As far as prison works go, though, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption was leagues better."
4,Much better than I thought.,I really enjoyed this book! I had already seen the movie and enjoyed that as well - I love Tom Hanks! But I just didn't think I would enjoy this story in written form. I also don't like to read books after seeing movies so I wasn't looking forward to it. But my book club selected it one month so I was stuck joining in or being left out in the cold. Originally I borrowed a copy from a friend because I didn't want to spend money on a book I didn't think I would enjoy. But it didn't take me long to figure out this one book that needed to be on my bookshelf so I picked up my own copy. This is truly a touching story that will make you look at life in a whole new way.
4,Very Good Story,"I have reviewed this book before, but feel the need to do it one more time. I just saw the movie and it was a close facsimile of the book. I was a NYS corrections officer for 15 1/2 years. When I read the book I imagined the Mile as the one that was at Sing-Sing. While I didn't work there in the electric chair days, the old area is still an active part of the jail in another capacity. So I had an idea of how the Mile was supposed to look and the image in my mind helped comprehend the book. Apparently most old death rows were set up the same. The interesting characters in the book and movie were enough to keep the long movie interesting. Rarely do books and their movies share so much in common. I've already reviewed it so I won't re-review it. I just wanted to shed this light on it."
5,"Touching, Gruesome, Real","This is the second Stephen King book I've read. The first was Needful Things. The Green Mile is a wonderful book. Although, some of the details may seem farfetched and maybe unnatural, it is possible that these things could happen and have happened. Death row is a big conflicting subject. Yet, Stephen King, lets you see both sides of the fence in this novel. The accused and the victims family. How each has to deal with circumstances as they've been dealt the wrong hand."
5,One of his best ever!,"This was one of the best of King, and I've read them all. I bought the complete book and read it all at once. He had slipped in several prior books, but this one clearly evidenced his ability to mesmerize without the flash and dash of absolute horror."
3,Should have been abridged,Don't get me wrong the book is in itself one of the more captivating books I've read in a while but the fact that it was 536 pages discouraged me at times eary on in the book. The feeling and mood of the book are rather easy to pick up form an early stand point in the book and the characters seem real many times throughout the entire book and you can almost sympathize with the character's feelings and emotions towards the prisoners. All in all the book has a lot of history within the covers and the fact that he reviews what happened in the last chapter with the first page of the next makes it easy to know what's going on in the book and helps you not forget what happened if you're forced to put the book down.
5,Powerful book.,"This is one of the most powerful book I've ever read.If your familar with the book, then you will truly love this."
3,Good plane reading,"The Green Mile is good mainly because it goes quickly. It is not particularly well written, but like any good serial novel it has a fair amount of suspense that makes it hard to put down. The story of the convicted killer who proves to have incredible healing powers and a great heart is compelling and memorable, and something you can fully appreciate after a very superficial read. It is not great literature, but it is certainly entertaining and pleasant for the short time it takes to read. I would recommend it to someone who has some time to kill and wants a feel good book to keep them company."
4,GROOVY!,"I've just finished reading and all i can say is that these books are some of the best I've ever read. The character descriptions are truly great, and beats the $hit out of Dean R. Koontz. After I ws reading the book in about 20-30 miniutes i started to think they were more written like a biography than a novel, and what an interesting biography it is. -Per"
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"This was the first Stephen King novel I have ever read, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I expected a story filled with gratuitous violence, but instead I found a story with interesting characters and a meaningful plot. There is a certain amount of blood and guts, for those that like that sort of thing, but it is not what makes this story so compelling. It was very hard to put this book down because I could hardly wait to see what was going to happen to Paul Edgecombe and John Coffey. I am also anxious to see these characters come alive on the silver screen when the movie comes out in December 1999."
5,Another Great Read,"I loved this movie and did not realize it was a Stephen King book till recently. I am not a fan of horror but after his latest release of11/22/63I went back and gave this author another look. ((grin))This is a great novel with a touch of supernatural and suspense to keep you reading. The ending was wonderful and I really like that the story was told through the Older Version of ""Boss Edgecombe"""
5,This is Easily King's Best Novel of the Nineties,"I love Stephen King, but I have find most of his novels after 1988 to be disappointments. THE GREEN MILE is the big exception. This an almost perfect novel with a great story, believable characters, and a terrific sense of momentum that carries you to the very end. It's a King book that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with his other classics, such as SALEMS LOT, THE DEAD ZONE, THE STAND, THE SHINING, PET SEMETARY and MISERY.If you've never read King before, THE GREEN MILE a lovely place to start, and will help you understand why he's such a popular writer with such a huge following. Highly recommended."
5,King's best work,"I am a really big Stephen King fan and make an effort to read as much of his work as I can. This is by far my favorite. A very suspenseful and rich storyline. There are just some books that you feel extremely satisfied after reading and this is defenitly one of them. I couldn't put it down, I read it in a day and a half and I can just about guarantee you will to. If you have never read a Stephne King book before this book will get you hooked."
5,cannot be put away once you started reading,"This is the first King's story I read. I saw the movie Shawshank Redemption first and cannot help buying another one to read. The green mile is really easy to read and to follow. Those stories are so real and those simple words expressed far more emotions that I cannot describe. I was really horrified by the section of the day when Ed Del walks the green mile by Percy Wetmore, I was reading it on the subway and missed the statoin and carried all the way to Harlem, that was about the time I can not continue after I found out why the sponge was left dry..."
4,Green Mile,Wow! What an original story. I loved it. Maybe one of Steven Kings best novels ever. It's highminded and noble. It's unforgetable.Cryptid: The Lost Legacy of Lewis & Clark
2,"Detailed theory, great as a reference",The book is very descriptive in the area of theory but less so in the area of fully worked problems in use as a classroom textbook. The organization of the book material from one topic to another could be better.The second edition of the book is about the same as the first exept for the introduction of a website about the book and a cd-rom with slides and sample programs for electronics.
1,Cool looking but thats where the cool ends.,"I bought one of these cool looking coffee makers and it quit working two weeks later.The clock went all wacky and the buttons quit working and so I couldn't even get it to make any coffee at all. A complete waste of my money, no wonder they where on sale for $14.99, its not even worth that much money. I should have stuck with the old reliable Mr. Coffee, at least they work a long time."
3,hard to handle!,"I liked the look of this item and since I drink lots of coffee, am always on the lookout for a new and better coffee maker. I received this yesterday, and put it right to work. First, let me say, it takes up a lot of room on the counter. There is a ring around the bottom of the pot so the pot does not rest directly on the hotplate. This makes putting the pot back into the maker a not very smooth experience unless you hold it just so and slide it in slowly. Also, the removable water resevoir is slippery and unwieldly and does not stand up straight in the sink to fill. Putting it back into the maker is also a little tricky, as like I said it feels slippery, and when full, is heavy."
5,Best of the trilogy,"I really liked this book. Nessa, the heroine, is a cripple and for that she is banned by her own people, including her parents! She is a shielder, a race on the brink of extinction. The shielders are hunted down and killed by an evil dominion that rules the galaxy. When her help is needed for a dangerous mission, Nessa takes off in an old spaceship and encounters Chase. The story is really heartbreaking sometimes and also very original (I loved her pet). The love story between Nessa and Chase is convincing and there is enough action in the novel too. I liked this first book even better than the second book, Shadower (which actually takes place before this one)and the third, Shamara. But they are all 3 very good!"
2,"pokemon, their so........","thunder shock and seaside pikachu... yet another chapter in the never ending pokemon chronicles. in thunder shock, ash goes to vermillion city to challange lt. surge to a pokemon battle. he wants to evolve his pikachu so he can beat lt.surge's raichu, but then he realizes he can beat him with his pikachu by using it's speed. and he wins with that pikachu like he always does. and in seaside pikachu, all of the gang go on a cruise on the st. anne. it sinks. and they (and team rocket)are the only ones still on the boat, after it sinks. but don't worry, all will prevail in the end. if you buy these movies, you will see a few hours of adorable pokemon. man, these things are so cute ... that's how cute they are. two stars for keeping the kids quiet."
5,Chinese Roasted Chestnuts,"These Chinese chestnuts are perfectly cooked and very moist in one's mouth. They make a perfect chestnut dressing for the Thanksgiving or Christmas turkey. Having ordered them twice now, we can honestly say they are a very good and wholesome product. I look forward to purchasing more of these delectible chestnuts. They make the cooking process less bothersome around the busy holidays."
2,Not very happy with product,I received the chestnuts and my family was quik to open one however the taste of chestnut tasted bad. I took the bag and the smell was wrong. I examined the bag and it was expired. I was very disappointed in this company and when I contacted them. They explained that it was a new girl and she grab the wrong box?? They credited my cc but never an apology.
5,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,"EXCELENTE PRODUCTO EL SOFTWARE ELITE ES MUY FUNCIONAL, ME PARECIO REALMENTE UN PRODUCTO DE BUENA CALIDAD LO RECOMIENDO"
5,One of the good ones,Some of the LBT DVDs fall flat with my kids but this is one they request over and over.
3,Stories from Laos,"This book contains fourteen short stories and had just average entertainment. If you want to learn about the Lao culture it will help you understand and it is a good book for that purpose. Unfortunately, the stories were not very exciting. Each one had a nice moral or a lesson to learn and put a smile on my face. But, if you are a busy person it might not be worth your time to read this book. It was not a bad collection; I just expected more."
3,Okay collection of stories,"I thought this book was going to be more of a collection of ""folk"" stories from Laos. Stories about the turtle and hare. But in actually it is made up of more short and simple stories. The book is written in a very simple term and gave a bit of insight into what Laotians value among themselves and others. It is mostly about giving to the community, being a part of the community, being proud of being a ""civil servant"". There are observations of corruption in one story. But it is worth a read, as there doesn't seem to be anything like this out there (written by a Lao author). I would keep this book in support of seeing more Lao writers in the future."
5,100% COMFORT,THIS NECK STRAP IS AWESOME! i IMMEDIATELY FELT A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE COMPARED TO THE UNCOMFORTABLE STANDARD WEB STRAP. MY PRACTICE SESSIONS ARE SO MUCH EASIER. THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING PRODUCT.
1,What Happened to Quality Control?,"I'm a pro player, play various saxes on gigs, & was looking forward to getting my new strap. I have used Neotech straps ever since they first came out, but it had been a few years since I purchased one. However, upon opening it and putting it on, it felt nothing at all like they used to. It seemed very cheaply put together, and almost like they left off the inner & outer layer of material. They were kind of spongy & bouncy, thus their claim of reducing the feel of the weight of the horn. Well this feels stiff, has very little cushioning, and will take quite a while to actually sit on my neck, as it is now so stiff, it just wants to remain straight. I am very, very disappointed in this, Neotech's quality has gone way down hill, and I will be returning it."
4,Not what I expected,"Pictures can be deceiving. This strap is basically a cut piece of foam. I pictured it a bit differently. However, it is for my son and he was quite pleased. He said it was exactly what he needed. It took the pressure off his neck."
2,Questionable Quality and Delivered Without Packaging,"I'm giving the Neo Tech saxophone strap only 2 stars because the one I purchased and received came without any packaging and doesn't seem to be as well made as the Rico Padded Sax Strap (which are both the same price). I was very disappointed with the quality of the Neo Tech Sax Strap and felt that I received an ""openned"" or ""returned"" product. Consequently, I'm not able to recommend the Neo Tech Sax Strap."
3,Pointless product,"I used one of these for years, and it is great for what it is. But what it is is a practice strap, and if you are just practicing, it makes much more sense to use a harness. A harness is much more comfortable, and if you play hard and get sweaty, this strap gets cloying around your neck. A harness doesn't.In short, get a harness for practicing and a classy classic normal strap for gigs. Unless you are the kind of music dork that doesn't mind playing in public wearing one of these, in which case I'd say why not go total dork and wear a harness onstage too."
4,Sax Strap,As advertised - shipped etremely fast 24 hours. This strap fits well and supports the neck. The latch was suprisingly strong and easy to use.
2,neck strap,"This is a great strap for an ALTO sax. It is too short for a tenor sax. There is a longer model with the closed hook which I think would work on the tenor sax, and I would order one if it was offered on this site. I think it would be very comfortable if it were long enough for my tenor."
5,VERY COMFORTABLE,"This is a very high quality,comfortable,and durable neck strap.i like how the strap is easy to adjust the length,and it makes your sax feels so much lighter!"
2,"Messy, Messy.......","Just got mine today have cooked two batches of rice (very small amounts no more than a half a cup of uncooked) both times it boiled over and got the lid and sides gooey and crusty The first time it burned the rice (Not too bad, about like I could burn it myself in a pan) the second I kept an eye on it and turned it off before it could happen again. Needless to say I will be returning this and getting one with a locking lid and condensation catcher (didn't know those were important until now)"
3,Helpful,"Coming back to the faith after many years, I wanted to find out the many doubts and 'contradictions' I supposed I had. This book it has to be said is a good start. Fr Most summarizes well and tries to keep things to a laymans level, however to be honest I got lost half way through as it got a bit deep for me, but it did answer some questions I had and stenghtened my faith. All said, the best thing about this book is that you can continue to read it even though some of the content may be for the time unclear to you, it seems to have a certain fluency to it, no doubt a gift of the author."
3,Paradise Outlaws-wheres Neal ?,"The book is about the beat writers and is also about the authors own recollections of and feelings towards those same beat writers. No bad thing for that necessarily but it is very much John Tytells personal history /involvement and memory of the beat movement.Good photos which help and Tytell is good himself on the analysis and worth of the beat literature itself.Neal Cassidy ? There are references but no pics as I recall.{Could have included an old snap or two I would have thought -the same goes for JK himself }. As Cassidy was at the very least the subject not to say the muse of the best of Kerouacs work { and was feted by Ginsberg , Kesey as well }he ought to have been discussed more. One wants to see the pics of course of what the beats looked like in later life { even if they are of old men with oxygen masks }but earlier snaps would have made a good contrast.Glad to have read it anyway."
1,PSP come on already ren and stimpy,"http://www.psp411.com/show/news/397/I want two things or three from my psp and UMD. First how about some respect?Second how stores actually stocking them besides online. I love Amazon don't get me wrong but sometime there is such thing as instant gratification.Third how about if we get actually box sets instead of just one season of this: Ren & Stimpy - The First and Second Seasons, Vol 1 (UMD Mini For PSP). There is only ten episodes. Whare are the other 22? HELLO is anyone listening to me?Finally let's get Grand Theft Audio out already. Can you imagine that some online stores have been accepting preorders since March and it doesn't come out ""November"". I thought July 26th was the release day.I love my PSP but it's totally under used."
3,ITS ALRIGHT...BUT BLONDS ARE BETTER!!,"haha good film. The only problem is not too much is shown.. I would have liked to see some sex scenes are something, but its still good."
4,"Excellent boots, great price","These are very comfortable, well-made and look great. So far I have only worn them with jeans, but they would nice with dress pants, too. I bought them in black and will probably get the brown ones also. Unfortunately, the price has gone up $10 since I got my first pair so I'll probably hold off a few days in hopes they go back down!The only down side was that they fit pretty loose from the ankles on up. In every pair of boots I have ever had, the leather generally conforms to the ankle/lower calf area but these do not. Takes a little getting used to, but nothing a thicker pair of socks can't fix."
3,"Editing Needs To Be Tighter, Some Really Bad Support Acting","So this is an Eastwood family movie, Allison directs, Clint produces, and Kyle writes the soundtrack. Sadly there wasn't an Eastwood that can edit. The film could be 20 minutes shorter and lose absolutely nothing in emotional build up or impact. Honestly, this is a marginally 1 hour movie.The good, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, and the boy Miles Heizer. Miles did a remarkably good job at his age, he was believable as a boy that age.The bad, just about every other character. Sadly they all seemed to be reading their lines.The train scenes, and Oh I love my trains, were not really all that wonderful. The train thread didn't work very well with the story line. There wasn't much of a metaphor here to really sink your teeth into.My apologies to those that really loved this film and cried. I just didn't buy it. Didn't really love these characters enough to care what happened to them. It was a very sad movie that was just way too predictable."
1,Sad...,"I thought I was getting a compilation of his previously recorded material, but unfortunately it sounds as though Teddy tried to re-record these songs post-accident...I love the guy, but his voice sounds strained, weak and too high. He should've left well enough alone...I applaud his effort but his past greatness doesn't need to be altered in any way!"
4,"Knife is long, cuts cake well, handle is thin","I bought this knife almost solely to cut 9"" round cakes into layers. It's one of the few I found that was actually long enough to do this in one pass, and 10"" gives just enough room to saw a bit that it glides easily and evenly through the 3-4 cakes I've used it on. It's sharp enough it causes almost no tearing at all, and the edges are as smooth as the crumb will allow.While it cuts well, I have to admit I do not care for the extremelly thin and metal handle. I get the feeling these are cast as one piece, so it's probably very sturdy, but it doesn't feel as nice as most of the other knives I've bought. Granted, it also costs less than some of the knives I've bought and it is nowhere near bad enoguh to make using it uncomfortable or awkward.If you need a long serrated knife for cakes this is an excellent fit. I really haven't used it for much else, but I think for most bread product related tasks it would do fine."
5,the best thing since sliced bread!,"I wish I had bought this knife years ago. For quick, easy, straight slicing, I have never used a better knife!"
4,A Keeper!,"I adore Debra Dier! This is one of my all time favorite romance novels. Sure, it's a bit sappy at times, but the romance aspect will certainly make you wish you had a man like ""Connor"" in your life. Laura's character left a bit to be desired, but for me, it didn't take too much away from the story itself. It's full of intrigue, drama, love, and even some humor thrown in for good measure. This title is no longer in print, so you'll have to search for a pre-read copy here on Amazon or in a used bookstore."
2,"Okay, but ...","I was not too impressed, but we'll see what the kiddos think when they see it in their Chrismas stocking!"
4,Works well,This is workin well for my husband's car which has no clock in it. He just wishes that it had a light for nighttime.
3,Arrived Broken,"Ordered two of these, great price, but plastic was broken on one. Nothing that a little superglue couldn't fix for now at least. Shipping too much to bother sending back for replacement, I am sure. Otherwise works fine, so 3 stars. I guess that is the catch with such a good price, not worth shipping back replacement."
3,My review,"I bought this charger in mid-August, and it worked great charging my GBA SP. However today, the charger stopped working entirely. So I suggest that if you need a charger for a GBA always look at the reviews, because the charger may or not last long as mine."
1,DID NOT FIT DS,"I just wanted a charger for my son's DS. Apparently they are harder to come by than I thought. This one is not the right size for his DS. It would cost just as much to return it as I paid for it so I am just out my initial money. Also, I am afraid to purchase another one because I can't tell if it will actually charge the DS. Pain in my rear!!!"
1,Wrong item,I thought I was ordering a ds charger and what I got was a charger for game boy advanced. Two different hook ups. Waste if money and can't use.
1,Catch 22 of brokenness,"It basically isn't worth returning because the item itself is worthless. It arrived rattling and broken, completely incapable of charging anything. Since it would probably cost me more to ship it back, I'll just settle for telling you to avoid this piece of garbage."
1,Not for DS,I ordered 3 of these and none of them were for Nintendo DS. Not worth sending back. What a disappointment.
1,Cannot be cleaned,"It was great for a few days, but it is physically impossible to clean without breaking the top."
2,Not necessarily leak proof,"Upon reading the other reviews, it seems to be luck of the draw. The one I got as a gift 1 year ago has leaked often since day 1. On some days it holds coffee no problem, on other days it will spew coffee from underneath the black plastic band/rim, running down the sides. Not to mention I almost ingested a large, gunky clot that had released from the inner chambers of the lid a few days ago, causing me to finally write this review. I will buy a more simple mug soon, one that doesn't leak and doesn't have obvious hygiene issues."
2,A too-fragile lid,"A few points to consider about the lid, besides it being impossible to clean: The top button pushes down a wide plunger to seal off the fluid from leaking out of the sip spout, but the button mechanism is molded to the plunger by a 3/16"" post, which easily broke when I accidentally dropped it in my effort to clean the lid. The result? A good travel mug, comfortable to hold, with a screw-top sippy lid with a sealing plunger that broke off, somewhat defeating the purpose of the mug's ""leak-proof-ness."" I should also say that there was some (very minor) dripping even when it was new and unbroken. My guess is that there are better designed, less fragile, options for a similar price."
4,"It does its job, now do yours","This is a fantastic product! I just received the stainless steel mug for Christmas in addition to the blue one that I have had for months now. Just like a sports bottle, it takes an extra bit of effort to clean such as soaking the top overnight in hot soapy water with a spot of bleach. I wouldn't call it a design flaw as much as using your head before asking for your money back. If you're willing to put in a little extra effort, this is a wonderful product that will keep you smiling with every sip!"
1,GROSS BUILD-UP!!!,"I had this mug for approximately two years (and it was working quite well), except I noticed my flow of coffee slowing down...so I figured the little hole that lets air in was clogged. Well once I really started inspecting the underside of the cap, only then did I realize the amount of buildup of two years of GUNK! It was absolutely disgusting. Because it was such a small area, I had to use an eyeglass screwdriver to scrape the stuff out - after about ten minutes of scraping layers of gunk out, I finally soaked it in really hot water - only for more gunk to loosen up!I have been VERY consistent with giving this mug a good wash every night - but there is no easy way to clean up the underneath and what you end up with are many layers of who knows what - absolutely nasty.I will miss my mug and the convenience of having hot coffee for awhile after the pour, and the spillproof techonology, but I will be going back to a much simpler design."
2,Don't buy it!,"I don't know why it's so hard for someone to make a decent travel mug. It's the same thing over and over. Black putrid gunk gets stuck in areas that cannot be cleaned properly...which can lead to sickness and disgust. You'll love this mug for a week, then get ready to be grossed out. Too expensive and poorly designed. At the moment, I use it as a thermos. I have to remove the lid and pour my coffee into a cup to enjoy it. The search continues."
3,OXO Good Grips Click and Seal Travel Mug,It certainly doesn't spill when it is closed so it meets my expectations on that account. I was disappointed in the amount of time it kept my coffee hot.
2,"awesome, but deadly",This mug has EVERYTHING I want in a travel mug. It seals tight to prevent leakage (even when upside down). It fits in my car cup holder. It keeps beverages hot/ cold for a very long time. It is so cool. Except when you find out there are IMPOSSIBLE to clean places. Nothing is worse than pouring a new cup of coffee only to have it smell like rotten soy milk.... ewww! Rotten smelly travel mug = bad. The lid has nooks that are impossible to reach or clean and it can not be taken apart. It's unfortunate because I really like this travel mug. Boohoo.
2,I hate this mug,This mug is hard to clean and does not keep your coffee hot. It does prevent spills-I will give them that.Oxo products are usually good. This mug is awful.
1,Awful Cup,"The OXO Liquiseal Travel Mug is a terrible product. I could only get a few drops at a time out of the cup which meant about five tries would give a decent swallow. Then I discovered that it is all but impossible to clean the complex sealing system. I just took it apart, but I can't get it back together even if I did clean it.Stay away from this item. You will regret it!!!"
2,"Works well, doesn't leak, but lid is designed poorly.","I agree with others about the leak-proof and keep-warm features of the mug, but the lid is not designed well, as far as cleaning goes. I have noticed that my lid smells absolutely disgusting, after using it maybe about 15 times. I get the feeling that there is no way to completely clean the lid, since there are areas inside of it that you can not get to with a sponge. And yes, I try to clean it very well every time I use it, and have not washed it in the dishwasher. Yesterday I tried soaking it completely submerged for a few hours, and that seemed to help a little bit. I think though, that if the smell continues, I will take my chances and put it through the dishwasher, just to try to sanitize it. If it continues to smell like is has been, I can not even use it anymore."
1,"Had potential, but design is flawed","I've been using mine for a few months now for my coffee and tea. This thing is impossible to clean and there's always a strange smell coming from the lid.I've tried soaking in vinegar, detergent, baking soda, hot water, everything. It makes my stomach lurch to think what's growing in the lid mechanism.It did keep my liquids cold/hot, and never leaked, but it is clearly NOT safe for extended use. You can clean it religiously but things will get stuck and build up and grow some nasty bacteria. Even if it doesn't make you sick, your drinks will always taste strange."
1,"Nice idea, bad design","I bought this travel mug because I needed a leak proof mug for work. I liked the idea of a leak proof mug for travel necessity as well since I take a bus and often need both hands.This cup started leaking in my bag after about two weeks. It also never kept anything hot (even when I followed proper thermos procedure and pre-heated it with hot water.) On top of all this it collects liquid inside the lid which you cannot get out nor get in to clean. I cannot imagine whats happening to the liquid inside that lid. I thew it out.I would not recommend this product. If you want an item that keeps your coffee/tea super hot and IS leakproof, try Nissan.Nissan 14-Ounce Leak-Proof Insulated Travel Mug"
1,"So close to perfect, but ultimately unusable & possibly unhealthy","I was so excited about this mug until after the first use I discovered liquid trapped inside the top (I could hear it sloshing around when I shook the top). I tried everything to get it out to no avail. This can't be healthy. Then I came to Amazon and read that many others found the same flaw. I should have read the reviews first.This is a real shame because it is an otherwise fantastic product and performs exactly as advertized. I eagerly await a new version with this flaw corrected but for now, sadly, I have no choice but to return it and look for something else."
4,Great mug... finally!,"I bought this mug a couple of weeks ago and have been really pleased with it. I have finally found a mug that does not spill and that retains the heat for several hours, as advertised. I highly recommend this mug!!"
2,"Hot, Dry & Gross","The mug doesn't leak and keeps drinks hot for hours which is excellent, but it is impossible clean. The slime that gets trapped in the cap, after several uses, is unimaginable. Pipe cleaners, cottons swabs, you name it..this thing is next to impossible to keep sanitary. If you could take the cap apart and clean the inner workings, this would be perfect, but as it is, it's a breeding ground for mold."
2,"Very good mug for 20 months, however......","I've had this mug for ~2 years and will say it is has been a very good mug. With a good design, the sealing system is good preventing leaks when tipped and keeps coffee hot for a long time. However, I recently noticed small particles when cleaning the inside of the lid (only way to do this is to fill with hot water/vinegar mixture and shake it). After doing this several times and particles still coming out, I believe it is part of the plastic inside disintegrating. It's in the garbage now and I'm on the hunt for a different brand, perhaps a contigo. Bottom line is the Oxo was a great mug for the first 20 months (4 stars), but the particles coming out of the lid are a concern dropping my rating to 2 stars."
5,Love Love Love,"Love these mugs. Use them every day. If you leave coffee/tea in them overnight, you get a sticky film (I'm assuming it's the start of mold) on the red seal in the lid. You can pry it out with a large paperclip. Just run the paperclip along the outer edge of the seal where it meets the lid and it should lift out. Wash the lid and the seal with warm soapy water. It's a little difficult to get the seal back in. It never goes in the right way at first, so don't worry about shoving it back in the wrong way. Once you get it back into the lid, if it's turned or twisted, run a large paperclip down around the center of the seal. There's a divot intended for the rim of the cup and the paperclip will run right in that divot, smooth out the seal, and help you get it right back into position. After you've done it once, you'll get the hang of it."
5,For the busy coffee drinker.,"I can't go about without a nice cup of coffee a day at work. So far, its the best coffee mug I've owned. It fits in my car's cup holder, my hand fits inside to wash it, does not have a rubber top so coffee or any kind of liquid won't get stuck there and make it hard to wash. It has a click-release mechanism to drink the coffee, and it can be removed for washing purposes. This makes my mug of choice. I have owned it for 2 months now, so even if it would break now, it has served its purpose and my enjoyment. Up until now, it still looks like new, and it looks like it will last me for a very long time."
5,I love this book,"REALLY nice garden projects, not too difficult to make if you have some type of power cutting tool. I keep coming back to this book for ideas. In fact, I've bought other book by the Gertleys just because I like their style so much."
2,insert clever title here,"This movie quite easily had the budget of the sweet kung fu short i shot in high school for my video and photo class.the long and short of it: college kids are sent out to the middle of the desert (which doubles as a haunted, indian burial ground) to search for artifacts. a native spirit picks the terrible actors off one by one. there's a twist. sorta. kinda? eh.the idea, while not entirely pc, is decent but it's execution is very hit or miss.i will say that the scalping scene was cool. one of the coolest low budget gore scenes i've seen, actually.the transfer ranges from ok to terrible. you're warned about this prior to the movie beginning. i won't fault this flick for that.2.5 / 5"
3,Super Reader,"Nadreck of Palain IV is the feature Second Stage Lensman in this novel. In the beginning it details how he helped an Arisian stop Gharlane of Eddore, and be invited to become Second Stage.The rest of the book involves the machine entity A-22 found in Dragon Lensman, the young female Lensman Lalla Kallatra, and working out what do do with both A-22, and how to stop the Eichwoor from gaining a further hold.A pair of Clouds are influential in this, both Storm Cloud and a new Lensman Cloud, with it all coming to a head at a ball, thanks to a little subterfuge by Worsel."
3,Greatest Hits (on Intercontinental)...,"For the price, you can't beat this collection. It gives you a good sampling of Smokey Robinson (and Post Smokey Robinson) and the Miracles music. Buy this, and then if you like what you hear, pursue the actual albums or better anthologies! Three stars!!"
3,A mixture of the luminous and the laborious,"There were points in this collection of essays in which I was totally enraptured and connected. I found a thrill in some of the author's descriptions and concepts similar to the exhilaration of airplane landings and take-offs. In contrast, there were parts of each essay which I found to be tedious and even unrelated. These were the boring periods of a too-long transcontinental flight when I've even seen the movie!However, upon closing the back cover, I was glad I made the journey. I arrived at my destination basically content that I made the trip. My fare was worthwhile."
4,Very straight forward,"Erik Estrada's book is the best Hollywood bio I have ever read. He holds nothing back and is very honest about rough times and regrets in his life (i.e. failed marriages, his shaky relationship with Larry Wilcox). He seems like such a terrific person and great friend, too. God bless him, Nanette, and his two boys.Also, wasn't Mr. Estrada so much fun to watch in ""CHiPS '99:? :)"
2,I really want the black out cake to work!,"I bought this book because i have seen the chef several times on the food channel plus i did read the reader reviews. i tried the blackout cake (twice) and both times the cake overflowed into my oven! not fun. i read the recipe over and over again, checking measurements, pan size, oven temperature etc. i can almost be certain that i followed it to the T. I wonder if he means 2 8-in cake pans? i am just frustrated. is it an imprint? or is it something i did? anyone have any tips, please let me know. i am a little weary of trying any other recipes out of this book as of now. hope others have better luck."
1,5 Stars if Disk B was OK,"I have season 1 and love it.I purchased season 2 and disk B has a bad track little over half way into the disk.Amazon quickly replaced the set - same problem with the second one. This is a production issue.I attempted to contact the manufacturer directly and get the disk replaced but they can not be reached.Until the manufacturer addresses the bad track issue - there is one lesson that will fail.I patiently wait.By the way, Amazon was great at attempting to resolve the issue."
3,A 3.7 RATING WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE BUT I FOUND IT SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING!,"The plot and character development is quite good but at times I found the herione so vexing that I almost stopped reading it! There's action, mystery and adventure. Gabriel is smoking HOT!! However, in my opinion the love scenes could have been a bit more detailed. Therefore, although this book is classified as romantic erotica I disagree. Romance yes, Erotica NO!"
5,Fisher Reels You In Hook Line and Sinker,"I have been a fan of Fisher's ever since her I heard her songs on MP3.com (which were downloaded over 2 million times with something like 8 of her songs in the top ten). The two standouts are ""Any Way"" and ""I Will Love You"". She was discovered by the public at large in San Diego when a local radio station liked them so much they decided to air the song ""I Will Love You"" during the afternoon rush hour. Instantly the song became the most requested song in San Diego because of it's sentimental and beautiful tone. I would love to see this artist get some attention because her music is so pure and full of emotion. give it a whirl! - Jay"
5,Simply Superior,"Simply superior, that's the best phrase to use to compare this band to others in the same genre. Fisher has crafted a sumptuous garden full of texture, emotion and vibrant imagery. Part of me whishes they have more exposure to the listening public, and another is happy that Fisher is a private treasure I have discovered and I don't have to share with anyone. I can't wait for their next release! :)"
5,Absolutely wonderful,"I already have ""One"" and ""Minus One"", the two CDs Fisher released through mp3.com, and have been waiting impatiently for this CD. Fisher's voice is magic; the lyrics are funny, sad, and human. If you like the samples, you'll love the rest of the CD."
5,Had to Buy it,"When I first listened to the cd, I thought that Fisher sounded like Fiona Apple. She still does as I listen to this cd again but not so much as the first time. Fisher is her own singer/songwriter. Each song is a real winner, ""Miseryland"" is a particular favorite of mine as is ""I Will Love You""."
3,ok Apps EXCEPT iMovie HD!! Avoid,"All works great except iMovie HD. If you try timeline editing it seems to leave some invisible footage at the end of your video. Makes editing small clips or small videos very difficult. The invisible footage does not get exported but it just feels more flaky than a fully updated iMovie 4 (as long as you remember to SAVE PROJECT before emptying trash).Would only buy for the new iDVD, so if you don't have a superdrive, iLife5.0 will be a waste of money as iPhoto will be your only useable app."
4,A nice upgrade,"We upgraded our old iLife (`04) to `05 primarily because of the new version's ability to deal with wide screen dv. Everything is just as simple as before - there are no surprises. Garageband seems like a powerful application, but nothing that is essential to our life. iPhoto is a solid upgrade that has better editiing tools - if a bit cryptic for newcomers to video editing. I would suggest adding features like the old Metacreations Photosoap; of course that would infringe on Photoshop's area and that isn't likely to happen. I expect iDVD to be every bit as good as the previous version, though I haven't had a chance to use it yet.All in all this is a solid upgrade. I recommend it for anyone with a newer (any G5 with DVD player) Power Mac, a digital camera, and a dv recorder."
5,Create incredible new media - headache free!,"I really cannot believe how much iLife does for such a small price. Read that sentence again because it would be a shame for you to miss that concept. I would pay $200 for Garageband alone. But for under half that price you actually get 5 elegant, easy to use apps. And you WILL use them once you start playing around. iLife is reason enough to buy a Mac."
1,It was highly recommended to me but I did not like it,"I did not like the movie. The best part were the interviews that came with it as a ""plus"".What was discussed in the movie is something that is around for more than 20 years and it just happened that ""just now"" the New Age decided to pick it up as ""new""...New Age is becoming more and more a commercial thing, big money, like anything else."
5,SHOULD BE REQUIRED VIEWING FOR EVERYONE,"This was my 2nd purchase of the product. I saw the movie in the theatre six times! Then, I ordered the DVD as soon as it came out. Loaned the DVD out to a lot of friends and family. Then gifted my son with the copy I had. I recently got remarried and wanted my new husband to see it too, so I ordered another. Still love it today. Everyone should watch it to feel inspired and hopeful."
1,Pap,"We are born in absurdity and we die in absurdity and no amount of pseudo-scientific, pseudo-religious horse merde is going to change that fact. But if you must, go ahead and give these shysters your money. Perhaps it will make you feel all warm and fuzzy. Or maybe it will you make you feel cheap and exploited. These people are no better than your average fundmentalist Christian rip off artist."
1,what the bleep down the rabbit hole,"The blurb that I read before buying this indicated that it was about Quantum physics and mechanics, but it ended up being about personal interpretations of spirituality. I was very disappointed in this DVD."
2,50% BS 40% Speculation 10% Truth,"The 10% truth is worthwhile enough to buy this DVD. Its a free democracy, everyone can have an opinion, even its off the maps & charts!"
5,Verrrrry Interesting,I also so the documentary and it sure sets you to thinking about things you don't normally think about. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning something new about everything there is.
1,Reason for non-delivery of this CD,"After ordering this CD I received a notice of a refund for the order. There was no reason given as to why or actions needed to back order, etc."
1,Gum drops battle for emotional dominance,"This movie fails on almost every level. Three directors should have been able to come up with something much more coherent than this. The few times that Quantum Physics are invoked by a talking head there is an instant cut-away to an absurd exaggeration of the proposed concept. There is enough psuedo-science in here to choke most laymen, though unfortunately our education system is so bad that many will be unaware-----While there are no shortage of opportunists who will profit from deliberate deception. If you don't find this belittling clap-trap the height of the absurd. . .Then perhaps you would be interested in some prime real-estate in middle-earth. The Grey aliens control the banks, but Ramtha will hold your money until the end-days"
5,Infinite Possibilities,"If you like thinking outside the box, if you always wondered, ""There has to be more to life than this?"" Then this is the movie to watch. Just go rent it over at blockbuster and see for yourself. This movie is not for the cynical and narrow minded. They can stay in their box if they like. I'm cool with that. All I know is that evolution of ones self takes stepping out of your box, so go watch it already."
4,Let's be honest,"THIS IS A MOVIE. It doesn't fit the standard of many movies because it is not just a documentary, not just a comedy or drama, but a combination. The uniqueness of this film and the presentation of it was great and the concept was challenging, but I didn't take it as complete truth being presented to me. Those who are giving reviews saying ""this isn't science"" you people need to pull the sticks out of your as ses and relax. Obviously there is no hard evidence to back up all the claims in this film, but there is truth in many of them and it makes you think. People, just relax. I wouldn't take this movie completly serious, but I highly reccomend it! Just think for yourself."
5,absolutely wonderful!,"I have seen this movie in my local video store many times but never paid attention to it. Then, Amazon.com recommended to me and I thought""Hey, why not?"" I finally watched it and now want to kick myself for not watching it alot sooner. This movie is amazing! I sutdy quantum theory, ancient religuouns, metaphysics along with a few other things. I have never come across material that puts it all together so wonderfully. Not only does it show how things are connected but it explains all of them in a way that anyone can understand. Then it gives examples of examples of everything that it talks about so you dont have a choice but to say ""oh yeah, I guess that does make senes."" This movie does not take one side of anything or any cause. It seems like its intention is have the 'observer' open their mind to more than what its used to. This movie should be required watching for college. If it werent for one slight sexual scene, I would recommend it as a requirement for high school."
1,Two parts mumbo jumbo one part science,"As fascinating as this film may seem to those interested it does all involved a major disservice by presenting sham science alongside the real thing. The sham referenced is the faulty ""science"" on water molecules and their ""reaction"" to emotional/environmental stimulus. This is not science any more than bigfoot research is science.Inclusion of this pseudo-science is the ultimately disappointing aspect of this film. Information that is sound as well as fascinating is presented alongside junk which only furhter serves to popularize the impression that science can't be trusted.Though if you are prone to accept Indigos' and the like as being worthy of serious consideration you may enjoy this film."
1,it didnt work!,"It was a real shame ,because I was hanging out to see this movie,but look out folks! if you buy DVD's from amazons they are configured to work on American DVD players and not Australian ones,so I still havent got to see it.Really Amazons needs to think about who they are selling stuff to and not sell things that arent going to work in another country"
5,spirtulal journey,This is a very thought provoking movie. If you think outside the box and have a new age belief then this movie is for you. It will take you on a journey and makes you question what else is really out there.
1,What?????????,"just don't... if you want to watch this... just don't... i have no words to describe how bad this thing is...I gave it 1 star because is the lowest rate, but in my opinion this deserves -4 stars."
1,What the Bleep!?-Down the Rabbit Hole,"While this pretends to be a scientific documentary on Quantum, it is nothing but a propoganda piece for eastern religion and the New Agers."
3,What the Bleep? Sequel,"Very interesting, but a little more than I needed to know after viewing the original set. However, I loaned it to someone who loves it because of the focus on the interviews and less on the movie.I gave one set to my daughter(for Christmas) who was thrilled to receive it, but has not had time as yet to view it. There is no doubt she will enjoy it immensely when she sees it.Both the original and the sequel are very thought-provoking and give food for thought long after viewing them. It would be a good thing if everyonelooked at them. Could change our world!"
5,Life Altering Ideas.....,"This film opens doors of the mind that would never be opened without it. It shows just how unreal the reality we live in is. Of course we all know that there is no such thing as reality, just a perception and this movie does just that....shows us just how unreal the world is. I showed it to friends and they too just had to have it. Talk about expanding the mind.... If you are into the alternative way of being, check this out for it really explains exactly that...how to be moment to moment creators."
3,My bleeping ears can't always hear over the loud background music.,I am very interested in the subject of this video. My one complaint is that the background music is too loud for the dialog much of the time.
1,Worse than Intelligent Design,"Open your mind, don't be afraid of the new paradigm coming! I have watched this movie twelve times, and I still don't know what the hell is going on. Everyone who watches this movie will experience a wonderful life-change. Most movies have violence and blood and guts but this movie makes you THINK! I suggest everyone watch this as it leaves little doubt to the next step in human evolution. Open your mind to new ideas and be prepared to be blown away! Everytime I watch it I learn something new about myself. You either love or hate this movie. If you love it, you are a wonderful human-being with an open mind. If you hate it, you are close-minded and tied down by science. This film is an eye-opening mind-blower for people willing to accept change. I also recommend Mein Kamf, and philosophy for dummies."
2,Misguided Metaphysical drivel.,"I saw this movie a few years back. It left enough of an impression on me that I remembered it, so it at least gets 2 stars for originality.But while it starts off promising, it quickly slides into a shapeless mush of pot-inspired intellectual masturbation and half-baked theories.The only people who will find themselves able to get to the place this film is trying to lead them are entry-level Scienctologists and that seriously spaced-out professor you had in college."
3,Good flick but,"Good flick, but is this movie a recruitment video for JZ Knight's school of enlightenment where she summons the 70,000 year old Ramtha person? Knight did did not invent quantum anything and the movie however educational on quantum theory and mechanics etc. cannot necessarily connect her theories with the scientific world. Making statements such as ""we are God"" is quite bold and presumtious. These so called experts do not fully understand anything that lies in our universe so take this movie with a pinch of salt."
1,Quantum flapdoodle,"Quantum flapdoodle and meta-twaddle. I see a lot of positive reviews talking about keeping an open mind. Yea, right. Keep an open mind and these folks will throw a lot garbage in it.Why is it this movie trys to gain legitimacy from modern science but the moment one applies any sort of scientific rigor to their claims, you're accused of being rigid and closed minded? Either the movie represents quantum physics as understood by the people most knowlegable about it (it doesn't) or they're making a lot of half baked claims with no foundation whatsoever (they are).Save yourself the agony. You'll learn more watching ""Rocky Horror""."
5,Excellent for what it is!,"Sure, it could have been better done, and some of the sequences seems stretched, but overall the brilliant scientists really shine through and the editor has a vision he communicates clearly, cogently, with joy and entertainment.Read the other reviews if you want more details. I loved it and think it's worth seeing once, and sharing with people who have never been exposed to it."
5,Free thinkers only,"When someone looks at the reviews here you will see a strange thing people either speak highly of it or curse it to hell which says alot about the content if you are a free thinker you will see the many truths through out the picture but if you are a closed person you will see how this film is very threatening to your idea of the Universe I myself thought it was very thought provoking and very inspiring .It teaches you what I have found out long ago, stop trying to go after everything because basically you are it all ready.."
5,Simply Amazing!,"No matter how many times you watch it, there is something new! It is somewhat interactive in that you can decide how much information you want to know... Be prepared to be amazed."
1,That Guy Loves What The Bleep,"That guy likes the latest thing. That guy likes the hipster ring. That guy wears UGG boots because there "" IN "" That guy get's the latest trend and rides it to impress his friend, That guy loves his John Deere Cap, that guys always full of crap. . .Don't automatically swallow anything marketed as indie, or hip, or alternative. . .Don't become blind conformists like your parents....Don't become THAT guy."
1,Not nearly as good as people say it is!!!,"If you've read any of the great books discussing the implications of modern physics and eastern thought, e.g. the Tao of Physics, the Dancing Wu Li Masters or God in the New Physics.... don't waste your time with this nonsense! Some new age physics thrown in with a lot of psycho bable about some chick trying to get over herself and have a relationship. Quite frankly I can't see what one has to do with the other and I was rather ticked off I paid for this thing!"
4,"What the ""Bleep"" Do We Know","Extremely interesting perspective. Riveting and well presented, in an easy to understand format."
2,After all the hype...,"After all the hype I finally managed to get a copy of ""What the bleep"". Must say I expected more. Was an anti-climax to all the hype that was created around this movie."
1,correct information,"I was impressed by the delivery but so disappointed that I could not play the DVD's on a n ormal player, this product is obviously for the American market."
1,shallow spiritual crap,A bunch of unsupported/weak new age theories presented in a dull story line - nothing you can't find in conventional religion.
1,Amusing but scientifically bogus,"This is a flashy movie with lots of graphics, but it provides a very inaccurate view of Quantum Mechanics and how it should be interpreted. I am not convinced of either the ""Many Worlds"" interpretation or the traditional ""Copenhagen"" interpretation, but this movie goes into la-la land.The interviews with scientists have been edited very selectively to make it seem that the scientists are lending their credentials to the project. If one goes to the complete interviews on the supplemental disks, one finds that they actually don't agree with the point of view expressed in the movie.The only good thing here is the interviews with the scientists who actually study quantum mechanics. The rest is just junk science.Save your money and buy a book by Graham Greene instead."
5,Exceptional way to present the ideas,"It is just amazing how the dvds relate metaphysics and / or religious ideas with quantum physics facts, opening doors for what would be considered impossible."
1,New Age Nonsense Masquerading as Science,"My subject line pretty much sums it up.This is new age quackery straight from the Ramtha School of Enlightenment, cloaking itself - very unsuccessfully - as science.What unnerves me the most is that this film is being shown to students in Public School in one Ohio town in spite of the fact that it contains very graphic sexual content, and encourages the same.Rubbish, through and through."
5,VHS Movie,Seller did an excellent job in getting the movie right to my door in just a few days. I was surprised at the promptness.
5,Just What I need.,"Just what I need, a review of grammar. The story make it is easy to understand and remember. At 63 years young my memory aint what it used to be!! The story is interesting and it makes learning easy."
3,not pretty - but real gritty,"This book encompasses many Northeast Fisheries, and while I find myself sticking to the section specific to my locale, it has some great info on tools and tactics for all types of NE saltwater fishing."
2,mis-titled,"The title is missing the word YOGA. No where on the Amazon page does it say YOGA yet that is the first word in LARGE type on the DVD. I did a search for ""exercise"", not YOGA. I have not opened the DVD yet so I have not viewed its contents having read the back label. This DVD is for ""neck and shoulder tension, lower back pain, tight hamstrings, headaches, and carpal tunnel problems."" Wish I had known that up front."
4,Great look!!!,"i don't have this doll, but just from looking at her picture, i can see that she looks a lot like lindsay lohan! A while ago, i got the mary-Kate and Ashley dolls and they didn't look anything like the real people! But, lindsay lohan so totally does! I like it how they added a new character to the my scene goes hollywood dolls, because it was always the same girls! So I think this doll makes this whole my scene goes hollywood gang a whole lot more interesting! The doll has awesome clothes and fab hair!(i'm really into the hair. lol). I really want to get her(and club birthday chelsea)for my birthday!Sicily #2 my scene fanP.S. If any one knows where i can get club birthday chelsea that would be great!"
1,DO NOT BUT THIS TOY,THIS TOY IS NOT GOOD THE BRATZ R 100000000000000000000000 BETTER THIS TOY BREAKS REALLY EASY DO NOT BUY THIS TOY IM WARNING YOU JUST BECAUSE IT HAS MORE THINGS DOESNT MEAN IT IS GOOD DONT BUY IT BRATZ R BETTER BRATZ RULE MY SCENES DRULE
2,creeepy,"Normally I would like my scene dolls, but this doll is SCARY!!!! She has the ugliest, geekiest face I have ever seen. And this is part of the terrible trend to market celebrity dolls to young children. We don't need girls trying to be like Lohan at the age of 5."
1,if only 0 stars were an option...,uggggg i HATE myscene they sux! bratz r da best!! the war will never end!! hahaha
5,Oh my Gosh,"Okay all you girls out there need to stop being so stupid about these stupid dolls! and to that little girl named Angel who wrote that one review, it looks like YOUR the one who needs to get a life when you are fighting on the toys r us website! i love lindsay lohan i think she is gorgeous and i dont know why all of yall are saying that the doll looks creepy even though that picture makes her look creepy but thats all. You guys need to stop fighting over oh no bratz is better! oh no barbie is better! oh you guys are dumb everyone knows mattel makes better toys!! oh my gosh get a life! you guys are like 10 you should be playing with these dolls not fighting over them. Anywho thats all i wanted to say."
3,see,polly pocket was made by mattel duhso thay cant copy matteloh and by the whay even if bratz onlycopid mattel one time it still counts
5,RESPECT OTHER CULTURES!,"I can tell that the last reviewer isn't you're average 'American'. Since I DO respect other cultures, I won't say anything wrong about her's. But this is an American doll meant for American reviewers. And my doll doesn't have anything wrong with it. She isn't revealing at all. So I do respect your opinion, but to my culture, Lindsay is flawless.Chelsea Churro(My Scene/Bratz Fan;Peacekeeper)over, & OUT!!!P.S.-END THE WAR!!!!!!!"
2,A Younger Andy Rooney...,"...that's what Michael J. Nelson has become. This book is a collection of essays remarking on everyday annoyances, the wife and kids, frustrations in stores and at parties, etc. The kind of thing old Andy Rooney has been droning on about for years. The book seems to be aimed at a young audience who a)loves Mystery Science Theater (as who doesn't?), b) has no idea who Andy Rooney is, c) laughs at the obvious. The humor is sometimes strained, pointless, and obvious. As with Mr. Rooney, there ARE some funny things sparsely sprinkled about. Hey, I'm a rabid Mystie, I like Mike and am glad he's found a new career. I just don't think Mind Over Matters is very entertaining."
4,An all purpose introduction to clay target shooting,"If you want to buy just one book that covers the whole waterfront for trap, skeet and sporting clays, this is the book. It not only outlines the shooting tactics for each sport, but also provides very useful information on guns, ammunition and reloading. An excellent all-around indtroductory book."
3,Ok,"A couple of dents and scratches, 2 hours to build and thought it would be taller and more sturdy. It still worked out and looks nice. I used the marker it came with to hide the 2 dents in 2 corners and minor scratches. I am content with the way it looks in my space. Paid 200 dollars for it, think it should have went for 150 at the very most."
3,well intentioned,"A do it youself (homemade) movie that had a good idea, but failed in execution. Though the Yes/Roger Dean influence WAS cool, if you don't know those names you definently won't ""get"" this movie. The effects, and this was nothing but effects, had a glaring fault: The live action layer of the composite seemed to be filmed 'hand held' or something that made the live action element shake ever so slightly. This ruined the effect of some otherwise beautiful composites. I'm sure the video makers cringe when they watch it. Add to this some bad actors and you've got a mess. But, these guys Do show some talent, in a stoner kind of way, so they should maybe study this film, see where they screwed up, and try again."
4,tough read,"I'm still reading but wanted to mention that if you have never taken a French class, it is very hard to pronounce most of the names in the book.Although very insightful finding it a hard read."
1,Chanel A Woman of Her Own,I hated the book. Couldn't read it. There were so many french words that it made it impossible to understand. I finished the first 100 pages and that was all I could take so I will be donating the book to charity.
2,Not Captivating!,I did not enjoy this book and wished I did my own research on a better author to portray Coco Chanel. It was lengthy in boring details and never developed a true feeling for the subject matter. Coco lead an extremely captivating life - so I find it difficult to believe that someone could write such a book lacking in depth!
5,Yum,"Good product, not sure what more a person could really expect from them. I will be buying more soon as my fridge died and had to be tossed with everything else in the fridge. ."
4,Great,Wasn't expecting the dubbing delay but the videos are great my son really enjoys them. THank you will need to purchase another set.
3,all worked but 1 ???????,"All of the dvd's worked but 1, the abc 1 the first dvd in the collection when we but it in the player it was just blank i tried it a couple times and same thing BLANKKKKK! U would think the manufacturer would test these before selling them but o well? Other than that the rest of them were as expected ok and full of happiness and lessons"
5,Perfect Birthday Gift,"This was absolutely perfect for a Birthday Gift for a little girl that loves Barney, she was so excited & ready to watch all of them."
3,it's what you expect from Barney,the material itself is not something i would want to watch but my 2yo grandson is good with it. my problem is the physical dvd's themselves. two of the six would not play right out of the box and the other four get hung up frequently. these are all old Barney episodes and i didnt think dvd's went bad just sitting on a shelf so maybe mine got warped during transit.
3,Not my favorite...but it's Tony Rice and that isn't bad,"For my particular taste, this album is a little uneven. Tony Rice is always great to listen to, but the selection of tracks on this particular effort left me a little disappointed. I bought it after running across the rendition of ""Beaumont Rag"" on Pandora. That's my favorite on the CD and the others are pretty much filler. Just my taste, though."
5,Great product.,"Great product, I changed fluid and added the modifier and gear oil after 60,000 miles and truly did not expect to feel a differance, but I most certaily do feel the smoothness on every level. I would use it on my other trucks."
3,"Great concept, but ...","I thought this was a great concept, especially since my 3 yr old daughter is going through a stage where she's always concerned about her friends liking her. However, the illustrations were a bit too scary for her. She started out listening to the story, but would not look at the pictures. By the middle of the book, she was asking me to read another book."
4,"""A Hauntingly Realistic Novel""","Patricia Windsor does a remarkable job at making this novel come alive. Its eerie presence will intrigue you to read futher. ""The Christmas Killer"" is better than the title."
3,Not his best work,"... Or was it his work at all? I think this was compiled post-humously and perhaps it suffers for that. There is a good range of detail in this book but the layout is not as clear as I was hoping from Chow. Perhaps it's the small form factor of the book or the woeful binding (with pages falling out since the first opening), but it has sat on my shelf for years largely unused despite my active interest and involvement in the topic, and hasn't really delivered me much other than loose pages over this time."
5,another great jamaican movie,love this movie women can do anything if they put there mind to. one love peace to the world nice movie
5,Those boys from Newfoundland,This is my all time favorite CD. It is fun and exciting. Every time I listen to it i like to sing along and dance. It is almost as good as seeing them live.
4,pink dog harness,This looks sooooo cute on my little black shipoo. It keeps her warm in the house and it is so easy to clip the leash on and take her outside.
3,Cute and handy,"I don't like putting collars around the tiny necks of my dogs, so I like things like this. This is very cute on my little girl and very practical. The only thing is when you wash it, you have to iron it. If you don't mind ironing your dog's clothes, then I would get it."
2,Doggies dog harness dress,"This dress was to large for my dog that normally wears a small, also it was different from what is pictured. Wasn't worth sending back."
3,Remarkable tale of this Alabama farm boy,"First-time author Jack Sacco grew up in Mountain Brook, and ""Where the Birds Never Sing"" is the true account of his father's experiences during World War II imaginatively told from Joe Sacco's perspective. It is a remarkable tale of this Alabama farm boy thrust into the great conflict of the 20th century. The first beach that Joe ever saw was Omaha Beach in Normandy. He had never shot anything more powerful than a BB gun when he was drafted into WWII, yet his experiences with the 92nd Signal Battalion are a catalogue of the European theater's pivotal battles and events: D-day, the Battle of the Bulge, the liberation of the infamous Dachau concentration camp, even a post war visit to Hitler's Eagles Nest. Where the Birds Never Sing is an engaging story about a local man's small role in the cast we've come to call ""The Greatest Generation."""
4,"Latterly, Quite Readable.","Lots of pre-pub fanfare here, a ""literary event"" worthy of racking up magazine sales. Truth: The book is a page-turner for Naipaul fans. I don't think any less of him. Nor do I believe Paul Theroux's achievement has been accurately presented by the big book reviewers. The ""end"" is never the end, not really. They're both still living past the pages, assessing the damage, coping with revelations that may, in time, heal. I reserve judgment. A damn good read."
5,Interweave Press Books Corrections on the Web,"After reading the reviews, I hesitated to buy this book. I was concerned about the errors people talked about. So, I got it from my local library. Then (why I didn't look before) I realized it was an Interweave Press book. That made up my mind - one of the HUGE benefits of every Interweave Press book is that they carry Corrections to any/every book that they print on their web site. It's phenomenal. While we might say that there shouldn't be errors, there are in every book unfortunately. But, the benefit of Interweave books is that they do something about it. Check out their web site, click on Crochet Books on the left hand side, and then click on Corrections. Click on this book's name, and you'll find all the corrections - complete with highlighting of the part being corrected. I simply love Interweave Books, and I love them all the more for this feature."
3,Beautiful Squares,"While this book has a lot of different patterns for squares and gives you ideas on how to use them, along with a working with colors chart, it's a little difficult to read. It's the first pattern book that I've read that had a ""how to use this book"" section and I did have to read how to use it. So if you don't mind doing a tiny bit of reading and like working in squares this is a good book."
5,I Recommend this Book,"Excellent varieties of excellent squares. The table of contents features small photographs of each block plus its page number so you can see an overview of what's to come. With so many varieties of squares, this book doesn't disappoint. It even offers suggestions for mixing and matching patterns in various ways to make attractive, eye-catching afghans. Each granny square design gets its own page in which they also suggest different color variations in addition to easy-to-understand pattern instructions. It makes for great inspiration to try your own color combinations. All in all, I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who is looking for granny square inspiration."
5,"A ""must have"" for any crocheter!","I have used this book to make several blankets! I love how you can mix and match the squares to make unique blankets. The patterns are easy to read and work up quickly. The use of different color combinations in the book inspire me in future projects. Although piece-together blankets can be overwhelming to put together, I enjoy the finished project. I refer to this book for tips time and again."
2,L-O-U-D,"This little thing is unbelievably LOUD. I took it back the first day I had it. So, I can't say it's not reliable. but that was my impression that I got from it."
1,Insulting people at customer service tried to rip me off.,"I needed to purchase a filter for this product which I did on line, but in three weeks when I had not received the filter I place a call to the mfg. I was told that the piece I ordered was not made any more that there is another product the will do the job. I ordered two filters and a few days later received the filters. Two weeks later i received a so called filter in the mail with they charge to my credit card. I called the company and told them the story but they said you did order this and if you return it there will be a restocking fee. But I told them that I already ordered the right filter and was told that the internet order would be deleted. They said they had no such written info that I did that. They were rude and insulting to me. Please do not purchase and Campbell Hausfeld products. By the way I returned it and they failed to credit my credit card. Very bad company."
4,Just what I needed,"I have a large 25 gallon compressor for bigger jobs and needed a smaller one for putting air in the tires, basketballs, footballs, etc.. The big one was too much trouble and took too long to fill up. This one sits under the work bench fills up quickly and is perfect for smaller tasks. It's a little loud but not near as loud as the big one. It's very portable and great for small tasks and light work.I never would have guessed it was reconditioned, looked brand new to me."
2,Loud and weak,"Makes as much noise (or more) than some full sized compressors. As another review said, you'll probably want ear plugs if you need to let it run for longer than a couple minutes. The noise is really obnoxious. A compressor this small and weak should not make this much noise! It doesn't really put out much air either. Unless you're looking for something to put out a steady stream of low volume air, you'd be much better off buying a nice bicycle pump."
1,Absolute Crap (Is there anything less than one star?),"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I owned one of these units for about 9 months and used it sparingly. It is now dead. Dead! After using it maybe a dozen time, the compressor died.I used it for bike tires only because it did not have the power to fill up a car tire. It takes about 5 minutes to fill up the tank and generates enough air to only fill up one bike tire and maybe a little bit of a second one. You'd be better off to save your money and use your mouth."
3,"Pretty weak, but its portable","I bought this mainly for tire inflation, and that is about all its good for. It has very little power and little air. If you want a 120 volt tire filler instead of one of the cigarette lighter compressors, its good (although some kind of handle would make it much more handy). For air tools, You may be able to use a brad or staple gun, otherwise, its pretty useless."
1,JUNK,Soooooooooo noisy I almost didn't notice it never made it to 85 psi. Luckily Amazon is Amazon. Very easy to return. Thanks Amazon!
1,Very poor performance of Cambell compressor,1st compressor arrived broken. After normal return hassle and time the second Cambell Hausefield 1 gallon compressor (supposed 110 psi available) arrived and DEFLATED my 68 psi tire from about 50 psi to flat as a pancake and thus unable to move aircraft at all until I arranged with the airport manager to bring his compressor to inflate my tire. I cannot use this compressor for anything and will again return it. What a pain and over a six week period also.
3,Works fine; for a cheaper small compressor,"Clearly you need to think about what you need it for before you decide to buy the cheaper one. I have wanted a compressor for a long time, for all kind of uses. Eventually picking this one was not the best choice for me personally. But: if you would only use this for maybe airbrushing, checking tire pressure of smaller cars and blowing dust out of electronics, you would be fine with this one.I only have big cars, and the higher tire pressure means that you need to give it a couple of minutes to get to full pressure per two tires to be able to inflate them a little bit.The only real negative for me is that it makes a ridiculous amount of noise for such a small compressor. I thing even the gigantic ones are more quiet. Especially in a garage with no acoustic dampening, this starts to hirt your ears even when only inflating your car tires."
2,Too small for most projects,Too small in size to inflate car tires only good for bikes and such. Returned and bought 3 gallon from harbor freight for same price.
4,Nice compressor for home use,"This compressor is great for home use. It takes 2-3 minutes to fill the tank (1 gallon) to 100 psi. I found that the 100 psi in the tank is enough to raise the pressure in my 16 inch truck tires by 3 psi. I was also able to get the camper tires to 80psi.Several negative observations: The compressor arrived in a badly damaged box. The shipping label says nothing about shipping from alphaomegausa, so I'm not sure where it really came from. The serial number on the bottom of the compressor tank has been overwritten with permanent black marker. This makes me wonder if its a refurbished model. The included tire nozzle doesn't seem to fit the standard tire stem on US auto tires. I purchased another one a the hardware store for $7 that works great. The one that's included is junk. Did I mention its LOUD?All the negatives aside, I give this 4-stars."
1,don't bother - much better choices,"I bought this to add air to car tires, bike tires, balls, etc. Here is my experience.... Plug in, let run for a few minutes. Both of my kids ran inside because this thing is so loud - I put in ear plugs. It reached pressure after running a minute or two then shut off. I started adding air to the car tire and after adding about 2 psi, the loud comressor kicks in again. The 1 gallon tank does not hold enough air for a car tire. After topping off four car tires, which was a 10 minute process, the compressor stared groaning like it was ready to overheat. I let it cool off and then repeated with some bike tires - same disappointment. I put it back in the box and brought it back. I just got a Black & Decker Air Station, which I love."
3,MY SCENE HAS LEFT THE BUILDING,I purchased this limo for my 6 year old daughter last November. The best part of the purchase was the free MP 3 player.I agree with K. Mackey. I have tried everything to removethe 4 bottom attachments. My daughter had to push it around without the wheels touching the floor. We are also having difficulty putting the top down. I didn't think this toy would be this disappointing. It is now sitting in the corner of my living room and my daughter pretends Barbie and her friends are having car trouble at a rest area :(
1,A BAD EXAMPLE!,"THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A POORLY MADE VERSION OF THE BRATZ LATE NIGHT LIMO.EXCEPT WITH THE MY SCENE DOLLS THEY ARE TEACHING LITTLE INNOCENT GIRLS TO DRINK! NEXT TIME, MY SCENE WILL BE TEACHING GIRLS TO DO DRUGS! AND NEXT TIME, THINK OF A NEW IDEA!"
3,"I like it, but","I think the Bratz one is more detailed and realistic. Don't get me wrong, i LOVE My Scene. But i am not sure 'bout this, because it doesn't really look like a limo, it looks like a truck. And no one can drive this limo. Other than that this limo is pretty cool!"
4,AN ENTERTAINING READ,"DAWKINS TELLS THE STORY OF HIS LIFE IN THIS EASY TO READ TALE. I FOUND HIM TO BE FUNNY, CANDID AND INTERESTING. HE USES A LOT OF WORDS AND TERMS THAT MAY NOT BE FOR ANYONE UNDER 18. DAWKINS WAS PURE POWER FOR THE 76ERS DURING HIS CAREER WITH THEM. HE COULD BREAK BACKBOARDS AND SHATTER THE GLASS AROUND THEM. HE WAS STRONG AS A BULL BUT GOT IN FOUL TROUBLE VERY OFTEN. HE CAME TO THE PROS STRAIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL. VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE TIMES. HIS LIFE OFF THE COURT IS MORE INTERESTING THAN ON. HIS VARIOUS ADDICTIONS TO ALCOHOL, DRUGS AND SEX HURT HIS PLAY WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE THAN IT WAS. I LIKE THIS BOOK BUT BE AWARE OF THE LANGUAGE AND SEX TERMS."
4,Excuse You?,"What the hay? The first dimwitted reviews for this particular album don't even address the album at all! First of all, the other ""inspired by"" soundtrack, which does contain the songs by Leigh Nash and Beth Orton and the like, is a rather good listen. But this album is also worth buying because of the great score effort put forth by Mychael Danna. The strings, and use of bansuri, help to provide a sweet, simply, yet soulful musical rendering of the movie. It's great background music for when you need to relax, do some catch-up work, or even an intimate dinner. Whatever your purpose, do listen (and hopefully buy) this CD for its relaxing---and, perhaps, inspirational---nature.Oh, and the Gwyneth Paltrow rendition of ""Cruisin'"" is on the DUETS soundtrack, BUDDY!"
1,Taste like soap,"This tastes like soap. And it sticks with you forever; drinking water doesn't help remove it. I recommend this for anyone who needs to wash someone's mouth out with soap - much less messy.I bought a pack at World Market because it was unique and out of the 10 people or so I've given a piece - only one likes it. So there is a market for this.Also the smell comes thru the package and if you hold the package too long,your hand starts smelling like it."
3,My favorite candy,"Same great candy I remember from my youth, but I was disappointed when I opened it and found it to be stale with most pieces broken."
4,DARK FUNERAL - Only Death Is Real!!,"Well, this is Dark Funeral's legendary 1994 debut mCD remastered plus 2 very killer bonus tracks, and they are indeed killer, 6 diabolical tracks in total! ""Equimanthorn"", and ""Call from the grave"" are the extra 2.. This mCD is pretty good.. Hellish guitar riffing, wicked hateful vocals, thunderous drumming, somewhat raw production, all make up for an *evil* sounding CD! If you have not heard Dark Funeral, then this may be a good CD for you to start of with, or just get their ""Secrets of the black arts.."", or ""Vobiscum Satanas"" All in all, this mCD is not bad at all, but I highly recommend you getting ""Secrets of.."" If you like Dark Funeral, also check out killer swedisn BM acts like.. Funeral Mist, Triumphator, Setherial, Sarcasm.. Well, that's all for now.. Remember, only Death is real!!!"
3,Not his best,"But still entertaining, as are all of the late Ross Thomas' novels. The plot moves from LA to Washington DC to Singapore, with the usual lascivious stranger. Nothing deep. Missionary Stew is still his best."
4,Clean Lines,"I needed a cookbook holder, and after looking at many online and in the stores, this one had the nice, simple look to it that I was looking for. It holds cookbooks of various sizes, which is helpful."
5,Best one out there,Gave to my wife for a gift and it's perfect. Very big so able to hold all size cookbooks. Keeps splatters of the books too.
5,Love this!,"My girlfriend had this and I wanted one so bad! Found it here, and the color is actually a nicer, deeper, brown wood. It's wide and sturdy, and it makes cooking from any size book so much easier! It's a bit pricey, but worth it. It's sturdy and will last a lifetime!"
5,Love it!,"I adore this product. It's very ""clean looking"" and folds down flat (I store it on top of my microwave when not in use). It takes a second to set up, accomodates cook books of all sizes... and met my expectations in full. I like using this over an easel-style stand because this one will prevent splatters from hitting your books - cooking is messy.. that's half the fun!"
5,What a surprise...,"Even though this cookbook holder got great reviews, I really wasn't sure if I would like it. Well after using it a few months now, I finally threw out the box deeming it a KEEPER!I like the fact that it's adjustable to accommodate nearly any cookbook and holds my place nicely. Even though it folds up for storage, I just keep it on the counter next to my mixer.A great choice!"
2,Pricey for poor craftmanship...,"I remember seeing one of these with a hardwood base and thought that was what I was purchasing. Alas, no. While the plastic cover and backrest for the cookbooks are the same, the base on this one is a light-weight raw wood with an ugly orangish stain. There is no finish so if you spill something on it, it will likely stain the wood and be difficult to clean. It does hold my largest cookbooks with no problem, but it is too expensive for not being finished very well."
4,All my guests admire the cookbook holder,"I really love this cookbook holder. It's practical, well made and easy to clean. I use it everyday and like to let a book stand on the counter.The only con I have is that the hardcovers - binding area - are a little damaged because the edge of the plastic where the book rests is sharp. I put a piece of fabric on it, no big deal but I wish I had noticed it sooner."
5,best thing since sliced bread,"This is the best counter top cookbook holder! It looks good, holds any size cookbook and can be folded up and stored away like a cutting board. Excellent!! and very very reasonably priced! LOVE it!!"
2,Disappointing,"Just like ""The Battle for Midway"" and ""The Search for the Battleship Bismarck"" by NG, this film stays the same tone as the two. They gather survivors from the Guadalcanal talking about the war while searching for warships in this campaign. Of course, the combat footages interweave during the running time.This campaign was fought so intensively for six months on the ground, at sea and in the air. It turns the tide of the Pacific theater. Before it, the Japanese always advance. After it, the Japanese always retreat. This film doesn't give me the feelings of the significance. In addition, it narrows the scope of this campaign and many important battles are not included. The well-known ""Tokyo Express"" is never mentioned in this film, which is another disappointment.To conclude, this film doesn't give you the whole picture of the lengthy Guadalcanal campaign. Another DVD ""Guadalcanal: The Island of Death"" is the very choice."
4,This book is a scream,"I can't speak with any authority about the truth of Janov's assertions in The Primal Scream, but I can say that is was a joy to read. Well written and packed with (sometimes unbelievable) examples from his own work with patients, it is as much a manifesto as anything else. Janov claims that his approach is 'the' cure for neurosis. What I enjoyed most about the book, and what anyone gifted with a debunker's mentality would probably appreciate, is his analysis and dismissal of all other forms of therapy. He sets em up and knocks em down. Fun reading for anyone with any interest in the ongoing psychotherapy wars."
2,Increasingly difficult to tell time,"I have owned this watch for a few years now. One of the screw lock start-stop buttons locked permanently within a few months after the purchase and no longer unscrews (I tried pliers). Consequently, the stop function is no longer available.I find it increasingly difficult to tell time with my fading eye sight, especially in dim light conditions; it does not help that this watch has white hands on a white dial!Overall, I find that this watch is cheaply made and not recommended for people with less than perfect vision. I prefer the gold model SNA414 which I also own (white hands on black dial and much easier to read)."
2,Plain...,"I couldn't get into this book right away...I thought it was okay but, it didn't have much depth! Sorry for the honest critique!"
4,LG Securedisk,I have had excellent luck with this drive. It is reliable and cheap. Have not tried the securedisk feature.
2,No photos of the plants.,I bought this book in hopes of learning which weeds are edible. The biggest part is knowing what they look like. This book does not have photos of the plants. Very disappointing.
5,Building bridges towards a healthier life....,"It's TRUE!!! My husband and I are proof that this works!!!Not only has the diet & exercise program prescribed by the Mirkin's allowed me to lose the unhealthy, excess weight (27 pounds !) I'd been carrying since the birth of our child, it has motivated me to become healthier, more active & consequently more fit. The lifestyle I've developed in pursuit of these activities has boosted my self-esteem and mental well being. I'm 53 and now have the energy to match my Fit 35 years old friends!! My 57 year old husband's (3 yr.) high cholesterol readings are back down within a normal range after having adhered to this diet plan for the past 6 monthsThe food groups we now eat are easy on the budget, fresh and attractive to prepare..and delicious to enjoy.Thank -You Dr. Gabe & Diane for the positive impact you have had on this family!Sincerely,Cheryl & Peter LamontSooke, British ColumbiaCanada"
3,Original cast Youre a Good Man Charlie Brown,"The faults with this CD are entirely my own. I have always been under the impression the original cast music was the one I liked best, however it appears I have always liked the next production of the show best. I ordered the original in stead of the next production, so the problem is all of my own making.The original just doen;t do it for me. cheers Barbara Ekstrom"
1,Original Cast Needs to Go,"For everybody who first heard the revival version and wants to hear the original - DON'T TORTURE YOURSELVES. This recording may have been great in its time but nowadays we except more fun from our musicals then just a piano and obnoxious singers - Reva Rose for example. I love the revival version and I would strongly suggest getting that one unless you are a DIEHARD Peanuts fan in wich case you may want to get this to have around for looks, but you probably wont listen to it much."
4,wrist wrap,"I was not able to find this wrap in any local stores where I had purchased it earlier. After finding it at Amazon.com, I purchased two of them.. I like it because it is not too big, but gives a lot of stability."
1,Still in draft form?,"I'm sure Mr. Miller is a nice guy, but that's not a reason to buy his book. No one should have to put up with writing of such poor quality. This is what rewrites are for! And editors! I read extensively, and I rate this book unreadable. Aspiring authors take note -- Read (or try, anyway) this book to get an understanding of how NOT to write.In fairness to Mr. Miller, I'm sure that a rewrite or two (or three or four) would have sufficed to tighten this up. As it is, though, this ""draft"" rates only one star."
4,Great Soundtrack,"I like this soundtrack. In particular the track ""Possibility"". I'm sure I've heard this song in another movie though. I've searched through other soundtracks by Thomas Newman but I can't find it anywhere. Anyway, this and the whole score for the movie creates a great mood for the movie and is great to listen to as an album."
5,Good companion,Peter Leithart's guide to the Divine Comedy has added a lot of insight and enjoyment to the poem for me. He provides a broad framework for interpretation and leaves some of the smaller details for you to work out on your own (which I appreciate). I'm using this guide with John Ciardi's translation of the Comedy. The pairing is quite good.
3,Short life-span,"At first I loved this product but barely a year later it is failing on me. I use this in my car to play audio from my phone and it has been an excellent way to have connectivity without the mess of an audio cable dangling all over the place. One end has started to fray and the left channel is now cutting out. I have aZip- Linq retractable Ethernet that I've used for years, and I'm somewhat disappointed that this retractable audio cable has failed so quickly. I feel that for the price this should be sturdier."
2,"Great at first, but broke quickly","This worked great at first. However, 6 months after purchase, the retracting mechanism seems to have failed, as it doesn't retract.Then, 8 months after purchase, the cord stopped working completely."
3,Not built well,"Yes these aren't very expensive cables but they weren't built properly to begin with. The retractable function didnt work properly and so I really couldn't mess with it much or the problem would worsen. After about 2 months, they fell apart and the audio distortion got progressively worse until they stopped sending audio signals. Disappointed overall with their build although I didn't have high expectations to begin with."
2,Not as impressed as everyone else,"I have found that this cable does not fit snugly to maintain a good connection. It tends to wiggle part of the way out rather easily.The zip cord function is disappointing. It worked for a little while, but it didn't take long for it not to function properly. After only a few uses it doesn't roll all the way back up nor does it want to stay unrolled most of the time."
1,Jammed Instantly,This product is of an exceedingly poor quality. It jammed up and became unusable as soon as i took it out of its package.
5,Simply Elegant,"If you want a simple, easy to store mini cable, this is for you. Works just fine, with enough tension on the rewind to slide in and out. Can't go wrong for the price."
3,where have your teeth gone?,"this is the tipical crack saophone user. he cant play but he does it. so, it good. but also if you want to take him as a serious guy he can be your driver.stop with drugs. die now."
2,"Good sound, cheap plastic","I have a pair of Grado SR-60s that are great for home use, so I was excited to see Grado had a behind-the-ear model when my old pair recently died. However, after only a few weeks of use, the plastic that connects the earphones snapped in half while I was putting them on this morning. Other reviews have commented on these headphones' lack of comfort; initially I was fine with their tightness, assuming they would stretch out a little over time (like other behind-the-neck models I've used). Instead the problem seems to be in the plastic used for the neckband, which is completely inflexible. You would have needed a pair of sharp scissors to get through the neckbands of every other pair of behind-the-neck headphones I've ever had (primarily Sony), so in my opinion this is a mystifying, infuriating choice from a usually stellar company. Sadly, as others have mentioned these headphones sound really great, but at $50 their construction is unforgivably poor."
3,Great for up to 6 months,"Sound and comfort of this product is great, but they only last for 6 months and there's no warranty after that. The first pair I bought stopped working (sound on right headset would come and go) after 6 months. I thought it was my fault for carrying them around in my backpack and since I was happy with it I got a new pair... which lasted exactly 6 months, this time the left headset became erratic (between sound & no sound) so I threw them away and bought a different brand."
3,Stiff Plastic & Design Flaws,"I agree with another reviewer that after about an hour, these headphones start to hurt right above where they sit on the ear. I had to take them off it was that irritating. Also, the headphones cannot be adjusted (the plastic mechanism that is).Grado designed the wiring that inserts into each side of the headphone so that when you take them off to rest them on your neck (which I was in need of doing in order to have any conversation with people)the wires directly contact your neck/shoulder area and that puts all the weight of the headphones on the very lightweight cords. I am sure that after a while, the cords at that point of contact will begin to fail. They just get bent about to much when resting on the neck area.I loved the sound but cannot handle the design flaws. 2.5 Stars out of 5"
4,alien paranoia!,"i don't know carroll or ""top dog"" so I'm coming at this from the sf side, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's got a Heinlein feel to it, ca. Puppet Masters."
5,Corporate Standard,"After reading and studying this book, I have made it the standard for our company. It has the right answers presented in a clear, concise and easy to follow manner. If a person follows the process in this book, he/she will be successful in selling, no matter what the product. It is particularly valuable in taching how to sell high-dollar and multi-sales-call products/services."
5,Live Miles,This is an exceptional 4 CD set from Miles Davis with a terrific supporting band. I feel he was on top of his game in 1961 when this was recorded. These sets are also very well recorded for live performances. I have nearly 20 of Miles' CDs and this set would be in my top five favorites.
2,Mangled & Tangled Hair,"Why can't the toy companies come up with synthetic ""hair"" that doesn't immediately frizz? My girls love playing with this toy but can barely style the hair, it is so frizzy and tangled. I have even sprayed detangler on it to no avail. Definitely do not pay full price for this toy. I was lucky to have found it on sale."
1,"""Spirited"" theory is quite general",Theory could apply to almost anyone. It seems you anticipate a child's reactions and moods and plan to change their environment or cater to them. How many people in the child's life will be able to do that? Wouldn't their expectations increase?
5,Great book,"I just met Toni Turner at a trading expo in Chicago. I found her to be a warm and intelligent woman. Her presentation skills, like her books, are straightforward and intelligent.She does mix in humor when she speaks, which I find refreshing in the stoic financial environment.In her books, which are based on trading fundamentals, she writes like she speaks. I thought I knew the basics, but now I realize I didn't. The text is well-organized and the reader's knowledge is built step-by-step. Her ability to take complicated material and make it easy to understand is fantastic. I've learned a ton about reading charts, and how to find good setups.For the price, this book is a gem. It's definitely a book every trader should have in his or her library."
2,Could be half the size,"I caution against this book. I found it quite patronizing and takes forever to get to the point. Some of the economics are quite dubious and I don't like it's continual use of analogies; this is an excerpt explaining how stock market cycles are made up of smaller cycles.""Here's an analogy. This book is made of many chapters. Within each chapter are separate sections that, when strung together, create that chapter. The sections are made of a series of paragraphs: the paragraphs are built of sentences , which are formed by words. Each word, sentence, paragraph, and section is a complete unit in and of itself. And, when looked at as a whole, they form the complete book. Get the picture?""If you don't mind paragraphs like the above (and there are a lot of them) then there are some pearls of wisdom in this book but I find the style quite distracting. If you are serious about trading this might be a good first book but I strongly suggest going on to read some more serious books."
4,An odyssey of the personal discovery of biblical structure.,"A biblical studies enthusiast describes the extensive parallelstructures in the book of Romans. The authors obvious (almost obsessive) enthusiasm levens, enlivens, and illustrates the fairly esoteric material."
3,I works just fine..,"This GPS works just fine. Delivers what is expected from it. Takes you to the destination whichever route you want to take, acquires satellites faster, sleek & light weighted, has different language options, one can comprehend visual & audio directions well.I have only one issue with it- when we have two streets to choose from sometimes while driving, the GPS at times does not speak up- remains quiet when it should ideally direct you. I believe it hangs or is slow whatever it is. Hence you may tend to get confused during such times & I would say it is not totally reliable.Otherwise you have everything you would require in it- various destinations to look up, gas stations, restaurants, calculator etc etc. The product shipped well before time & neat packaging.You may also want to know this product does not come with a cable to connect to the computer when you want to upgrade maps. Also It does not come with a pouch/bag for the GPS.I would suggest going for a higher model."
5,Kim in Austin Texas,Perfect for getting to my sales calls without wasting gas and time trying to navigate from directions or trying to read your mapquest while driving!Just don't order the car charger it comes with it.... :)
4,simple and effective,"Had a Magellan 4250 before it was stolen, got this as a replacement until I get my new car which has one built in. Very quick to acquire satellites, accurate directions, very simple voice directions. Not sure why you would spend more than this on a GPS, what more could you need?? My other one was a present, and while it was nicer with a bigger screen, both easily got me point a to b. Garmin actually is a little quicker figuring out where I am when I turn it on."
4,Great for the Price,"Purchased the Nuvi 250 at a reduced price at Amazon. Can't beat the price for the functions. Make sure to purchase the Nuvi model with the USB computer connection so you can later install updated maps. They go for around $65. Since I live in the North East US, maps of Canada come in handy. Used it in Toronto, works like a charm. The menu is simple and straight forward. Locating a satellite and calculating the route may initially take a little time but once locked, the system is accurate and dependable. Saved money by not needing additional functions like MP3, etc."
4,Does what its supposed to,"Garmin nüvi 250 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorThis is an excellent device. I have been using for the past three weeks and have no complaints about the GPS navigation. However, one thing I have noticed is that the battery life is not that great, and that purchasing the optional wall AC adapter is practically a must, otherwise the unit must be plugged into the 12-Volt port in your car - the only other way to charge the device."
5,Top Value,Best GPS for the buck! Works great from the car console; does not have to be on the dashboard or windshield to receive an adequate signal.
5,basic beauty,"This was the third Garmin that I purchased, one for me and the rest as gifts. For plug and play ease of use and a compact storage size this unit cannot be beat. The variety of features are very useful, and for a simple to use, inexpensive, dependable GPS you cannot go wrong with this one."
1,one disappointment after another,"ok straight to the facts:-Takes forever to boot up vs other model I had.-It takes a while to calculate a route (i guess a small processor in this one)-The map seems to be off by 400ft to the east. (Yes this is a problem!)-The voice only says ""turn left"", or ""turn right"" it doesn't try to tell you what street. (the other magellen I had does tell you the street. this is very useful in the city)-The voice notice to ""turn"" doesn't kick in until right at the intersection (booooooo!)--Basically: it's so bad that it prompted me to write this review."
4,garmin novi 250 gps,This device does exactly what they tell you it will do. We have had it since christmas and have had no problems. We tried to find a Kroger in atlanta and it took us straight to a empty building.. I'll bet it used to be a kroger there though.. Keep it updated and you should have no problems.. I do wish we could have afforded the one that spoke the names of the streets though.
5,excellent,"This is Beverly Barton at her best. JT, the hero is wonderful, every woman's dream! The heroine strong, determined but still in need of protection. One of the best in the protectors series."
3,Sound great but hurt my ears,"Grado makes great headphones, and they've brought their technology to a lightweight, high quality iPod headphone. The sound is really good and the weight and design is just right.The problem is: they hurt my ears. There's no way to adjust the size and they clamp down on the ears, so that after half an hour or so, you gotta take them off.It's too bad. Other than causing mild physical pain, they're great. So, if you want headphones that you can keep on for hours at a time, look elsewhere. If you listen in relatively short spurts, these will work."
4,Works good and my dog likes it,Seems to have fixed the bladders problem for my dog and she likes them so much that I don't have to hide them in other food anymore!!
2,Scatterbrained,"I felt that this book skipped around too much. It had many interesting facts but there was no flow. When the author should have stayed on one topic and developed it, he moved onto another. There was poor closure on some topics and others were not properly introduced to the reader.If you want a book with large quantities of interesting information but little organization or explanation, this is your book."
4,Very Good Biography.,This book tells you everything that you always wanted to know about Thomas Wolfe. It is well written and very interesting.
3,Wings on the horse,My daughter loves it but she was disappointed when the wings keep falling off and it is hard to keep them on. So I kept them off so she plays with it without the wings.Otherwise she loves playing with it. For the amount of money of the horse it should be put together better.
2,piece of junk,"I bought this for my 5 year old for her birthday. The wings keep falling off and so does the necklace and bell on it. Also the saddle falls off when you put the barbie on. I have many mattell toys and this by far is the worst quality I have ever seen. I called the compony and they offered a refund but how do you return a birthday present. Even though I am displeased with the quality, my daughter won't part with it."
2,not the best,"my sister purchased this straightener for me like a year ago for christmas. my hair is naturally curly/wavy and is extremely thick! i have always wanted straight hair, this straightener works okay on some parts of your hair but on the back and the ends of your hair it works horrible. it makes your hair flip out and the layers near the ends look very bad. i would only reccomend this straightener to people who have hair that is not very curly and thin. im going to get the chi and hopefully this straightener will work for me."
4,Very happy,"I have very difficult to manage hair but this straightener really helps to keep it under control. The only thing I am upset about is there was no bristle attachment with it. I really wanted to try that. But it does work really well. I have to put it at the highest setting. Be careful if you do! My hair is extremely hot to the touch. But it seems to tame it, even in the most humid conditions, and that is what I was looking for."
4,CONAIR Flat Iron,"I've had some bad experiences with flat irons and vowed never to buy another... and I'm glad I changed my mind. I LOVE this flat iron. At first I was thrown off by the handles because I'm used to V shaped handles. Now I actually like these wands better-- I don't have to hold the flat iron to my hair because the wands have an excellent grip. My only complaint is the automatic shut off... I just prefer to keep it on while I'm using it, but a press of the power button solves that."
5,great product,this straightener works great i have bought other straightener that were more expensive that did not work as well heats up fast and is easy to use my teenage daughters who are very picky love this straightener.
2,Not worrth it!,I have purchased two of these and i have bought my sister one also and they all fell apart. None of the three lasted more then 6 months. I would have rather spent the 60 bucks and got one that would have had a warranty and would last longer.
3,Very good for its price,"I chose this product because of the many reviews and purchases. I was a little dissapointed about the plastic look of the product when i took it out of the box, but the second i try it...ba-boom! awsome. My friends order one for them inmediatrly after trying mine. I'm not sure about durability but for the price this one makes an excellent job. Your hair will look super shiny & it only takes about 20 minutes or less to make your hair incredibly straight without blowdrying first. I'm very happy with my flat iron, no need to spend more in a fancy one..."
2,the flaws of this product.....,"I'm 16 and i have thick, frizzy, wavy hair. I bought this straightener a few days ago and I'm returning it because I fooled by the design and light weight feel for the iron. My hair didn't stay straight for even a whole day. This straightener also pulls out hair. Trust me, it was awful looking down at the hair coming out. I also started to have problems with turning it on right after my first use because even though I had plugged the iron in and pressed the on button several times it took a while for it to actually turn on. Sure.....60 second heat up....but like a long time for it to turn on. My suggestion is that try this product and see what you think, but make sure you can return it just in case. However, DO NOT be fooled with gold plates and so called ceramic technology. I suspect the plates to be only gold-covered metal to seem like a high end straightener."
4,Great!!!,"I bought this 8-9 months back, and its amazing. And more importantly, I am a guy with not-so-long hair.Pros:1. It comes along with a comb which is very comfortable.2. Auto power off. I always tend to forget switching it off, and it shuts off automatically. No worries.3. Comfortable grip4. Gets hot quickly.5. The comb is detachable. I just take it out and wash it regularly.Cons:1. The plastic handle is flimsy. Each handle is made of 2 pieces held together by a screw. The screw is already screwed up in my piece (after nearly 3 months of use). Right now, I have held them together by a rubber band (and it works just fine). I used to travel with this a lot though.2. It actually takes more time to cool down (approx 15-20 minutes). So if you are traveling, and use the straightner just before heading out, then you need to wait for atleast 10-15 minutes before packing this.Having said both pros and cons, I really love it. And believe me, it works well for guys too!"
1,Disappointed,My wife bought this hair straightener at Walmart and it stopped working after four months of using it only two or three times a week.
3,Dual voltage flat iron,I purchased this for traveling but find it does not work as well as my other Conair flat iron. I don't think it gets hot enough for my frizzy hair even though the description was the same as for my other device.
5,this thing works,"I have EXTREMELY thick, curly hair. This thing works. I've never been able to straighten my hair myself -- until now. Highly recommended!"
5,EXCELLENT!,"I was skeptical about purchasing this iron at first because I purchased a ConAir iron when flat irons first came out (when you had to put water in the steamer part) and it was horrible. I read all the good reviews, though, and I have to say that I am really impressed! I have crazy curly hair and this iron REALLY WORKS. I have had 5 different irons and this one is by far the best."
2,hair straightener blowout,"My daughter with very curly hair bought this straightener and loved it while it lasted; it worked really well straightening out her curls. However, after two months it just stopped working. I would expect a hair straightener to last longer than that and do not reccommend this product."
4,Conair Hair Staightener,This is a great staightener for a very reasonable price. It heats up quickly and the attached comb helps keep my hair untangled as it goes between the ceramic plates. I always get a lot of compliments when I use it!
1,BAD,"I've been through 3 of these already. The ""ceramic"" is not real and burns your hair, it dosen't ever straighten my hair without having to go over it again and again, and it's just cheap and messes up your hair even more."
2,THE Worst For Wavy/Curly Hair!!,I have naturally wavy to curly hair and I have used this iron for over a year now. 95 percent of the time this did not work for me.It has caused me a LOT of frizziness and it just didn't straighten it period! Mind you that many stylists have complemented my hair for being easy to work with. It's never damaged my hair since I use a spray that prevents it from damage. I recommend trying other irons...the wet or dry I am going to try next. Do NOT buy this please...it's a waste of your money. Save your money to buy a better one!!! :)
3,Good for beginners,"This was the first ceramic straightener I used. It's not as hot as some, but it does glide smoothly. Good bang for your buck."
4,great set of songs,"i'm not the biggest fan of Social Distortion, but this is a must-have collection of songs. these are time-less classics that you need in your collection."
2,Perfect doll,My sister gotthis doll for christmas from her god mother and she loves it she has no trouble with its clothes or anything and my mom loves it too
1,My daughter cried for 20 minutes because it kept breaking,"Let me start by saying that my daughter and I LOVE Barbie and Fairytopia. However, this doll is the biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased for either of my children. The wings fall off with the slightest touch. The ridiculous snap on outfits snap off independently and will not ""snap"" on again. The wires that run through the dolls body look like veins and are actually scary! After two minutes of holding her, my daughter burst into tears because her skirt, shoes and wings wouldn't stay on. What a terrible waste of money. I've already returned it to the store."
3,Pretty but not durable,"My 5 year old daughter loves this doll for one reason it lights up. She could care less if the dolls clothes pop off since half her dolls wind up half naked with missing shoes anyways.However, if your child likes the clothes find another doll. This dolls clothes WILL NOT stay on, they constantly pop off. The wings are the exact same way! It is like if you get the wings to stay on her top pops off and vice versa. I think the Elina Barbie with the light up wings is a much better buy as she too lights up, he clothes stay on, and her wings do not fall off."
5,Blacksmith's Manual Illustrated by J. W. Lillico,"Blacksmith's Manual IllustratedA excellent book though unusual. It is more pictures than text and very conceptually oriented. This is for serious and advanced smiths rather than beginners. Lots of ideas and inspiration but only a little ""how to"" sort of info. More useful to industrial smiths than backyard smiths."
5,Go Diego,"My 3 year old is in love with Diego! With that being said, This is a great babysitter when It is time to clean the house!"
2,Incomplete: yet beneficial nonetheless,"Overall the book brings out a variety of emotions, not all of them pleasant. There is a script presented regarding the evolution of human servitude and religious subjection. However this isn't brought to fruition through a series of pratfalls and humorous epithets but through stone cold extremes of fictional illustrada. The glaring focus placed on Millenarian Finis Dake is sometimes considered unfortunate, by those other that yours truely."
1,Totally uninformed,"Those who want to learn about slavery in the U.S. would do will to avoid this polemical and totally uninformed screed. Though it adorns itself in the veneer of scholarship, it is far from historically informed nor do the authors appear to have conducted any research at all. In sum: this is not a history of slavery at all, but a new expression of pro-slavery thought."
1,Has many flaws,"I'm afraid we have to agree with Bob F. There is no way to keep the bar from rotating during use. In fact, we tightened it so much in the attempt to keep it from rotating that we stripped the threads.Also, this will only fit a 26"" door WITHOUT THE BRACKETS. Our door is 27.5 inches, and only after we put up the brackets did we realize that we could not shorten the bar enough to actually fit it in. So we ended up snipping some of the metal off of one of the brackets in order to be able to get the bar in. I'd love to return this, but since we have manhandled it so in an effort to make it useful I'm not sure they'll take it. I also have drill holes in my doorframe now.I am so tired of poorly designed/made products. Are there any companies left that take pride in their workmanship?"
5,nice,nice solid piece of hardware. i recommend it. does not come off the door frame once installed.the foam is durable and after multiple use its still there.
2,Not the greats for kids,"Well I bought it for my son (12) and the bar is to fat with the foam around the bar. I also do not like that you need to put into the frame of the door 2 cups that help hold up the bar. I used to have one that you could just tighten between the door buck by turning it very tight. This one you can twist too, but only so much and you need to use the cups for it to hold me up. (230lbs)"
2,Author did not think.,"The author states that a resume without an objective is at a ""great competetive disadvantage"". But upon random sampling of the 175 sample resumes, only 28% have objectives. Therefore, I conclude that based on the recommendations of the author, 72% of the sample resumes are at a ""great competetive disadvantage"". If you want clear but expensive advice on how to build a resume, this book is OK. If you want to browse samples resumes, you really need to go somewhere else."
3,Not true to color,"The shelves are good and sturdy, good quality. However, I ordered the Mahogany to match my room furniture which is a dark brown with a tint of red (this is what the Mahogany looks like in the photo provided). The shelves I got were a medium brown. I'm not sure if this is the contrast of the photo or if I got the wrong ones delivered but beware if you are trying to match a particular color."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this but was disappointed. The writing was plain bad, like high school writing. Hard to get through it to the geology, which is boring and uninspired (like high school science?). Was this self published? An exciting topic like this deserves much better. See McPhee."
5,Love this receiver.....,"I have owned a sirius receiver that plugged into my cigarette lighter for about 5 years. I had the suction cup attachment mounted to the center of the front windshield. Ran my cord to the cigarette lighter then ran the antenna to the rear of the vehicle. Well the suction cup is fried and wont attach anymore. My power plug-in finally had a short and quit working. So I was reading my ops manual for my after-market stereo and noticed this SIRPAN1 receiver is a perfect match. I love it. No more cigarette lighter having to switch it on and off all the time. No more matching FM stations with your Stereo FM Stations to get the best sound. With this unit, you hard wire it into the back of your aftermarket stereo and run your antenna to the rear. The unit turns on when you start your car and shuts off when you shut off the car. Nice. And I get much better reception with this unit. Small enough to mount in an undisclosed area in your vehicle so no one ever sees it."
3,Not that great,"This book has two diet plans: Low-Carb Quick Start plan and Good-Carb Life plan. The Low-Carb plan is too restrictive, it's pretty much no starchy including starchy vegetables like potatoes and no sugar at all also means no fruits. The charts they provide to show GI and Glycemic Load of some foods are inadequate.The second half of the book contains recipes. I almost got excited about the 1 serving breakfast recipes until I looked closer and saw that almost all of them contained some kind of cheese. Being allergic to dairy pretty much limits me to a couple of smoothy recipes that I could probably substitute the milk for soy milk. I could leave the cheese off but why bother when breakfast eggs go great with cheese. I wasn't always allergic. This is a good attempt but it falls short."
2,for those who like boy on boy samurai,"i had hoped it would be so good, but it was simply boring. if you like implied romance and subtle affairs then you may like this. i did not find it entertaining, but that is not to say you will find it so."
2,CHERRIES and stuff .........,"Hopelessly foolish tale of a Samurai 'boytoy' savored and flavored by all within reach ..... minimal acting skills with lots of Swordplay [the real stuff, not between the sheets] and many a grunt in between it all.Lord alone knows why the 18 yearold achieved THAT status - cartoonish face, chilly manner and very little skin exposure.Only if you must!!!"
2,not what I had hoped for,One of the very few items purchased through Amazon that I have been disappointed with. The stain was not applied evenly so there were unstained patches at different spots. Overall these are just uninteresting and not very well made and was not the special gift that I hoped to be giving. Found the same thing in a local store for better price too. My fault for shopping at the last minute.
4,nice set,"they are salt and pepper shakers. not a whole lot to comment on. size is ok. grinder works well. if you think they are too small, go bigger size....i think i would have liked a larger pepper mill, but just my preference. price was right."
4,Olde Thompson 6-Inch Caffee Espresso Peppermill and Salt Shaker,"The finish on the product is great. I got it shipped all the way to Bombay, arrived in perfect condition. The pepper mill functions perfectly. Both pieces look great in my kitchen."
4,"My Original Set Broke, but Olde Thompson sent me a NEW set!","2nd UPDATE: After being really bummed and just deciding to buy another set, I noticed on the packaging that these sets are guaranteed FOR LIFE. So I contacted Olde Thompson, who agreed to send me a replacement set at no cost to me! I LOVE companies who back their products, and now we will have 2 great sets!I gave this product 4 stars because the original set did break, but they had such GREAT customer service.UPDATE: Oct 1, 2012. I've had this set for less than a year, and the grinding mechanism broke on the pepper grinder. It's really sad, because we loved these.Original Review: These are the perfect set for us! They are a great size, easy to work, and look great on any table. I haven't had ANY issues with this set, and we love them."
3,Mo' Thuggstress,"I think the only person who is keeping the Mo Thugs Familyalive is Felecia Lindsey-Howse. Felecia Brings the vibe toall of the songs she is featured on. She should of made""Do Your Thang"" Into a music video Like thay did ""All Life Long"".She also brings the vibe to - The Movement, Can U Dig It, andWho You Gonna Run Too. But anyways; without Felecia Mo' Thugswouldn't have made it to where they are now.Here are all of the songs she appears on - Mo Thugs Intro, Mighty Mighty Warriors, All Good, Ghetto Cowboy, Ride With A Playa, Otherside, Armageddon, Its Too Late, This Ain't Living,2 The Playaz, If I Can Go Back, Hey Young World, Its Your World,Get Up and Get It, Midwest Invasion, Last Dayz, The Movement, Do Your Thang, All Life Long, Can U Dig It, Who You Gonna Run Too.Give it Up To Dayzie Bone!!!!!!"
5,VERY pleased with this book,"I really like the content. I like the photos, I like the way it's written and most of all, I like the fact that I can understand it. I would say that this book belongs on every horse owner's bookshelf as a reference guide."
4,"Cheaply made, but cute","I bought my 3 year old one of these Barbies today, so we have no long term durability review. The boots (shin-guards?) will not stay on at all; I'm debating whether to superglue them on permanently, or try to add extra bands so they're actually wearable and yet still removable. The skirts are a little hard for her to get on and off by herself, but we've had no problem with them spontaneously popping off. The wings stay on just fine.I chose this because it was the most ""alternative"" of the Barbies available at the store (I plan to avoid the DVD and other merchandising). I'm not sure what people are expecting, quality-wise; it's cheap plastic, but certainly doesn't seem to be any *more* cheaply made than the Malibu Barbie I had 20+ years ago."
1,very frustrating toy,the parts of this doll come off CONSTANTLY. The most important part of the doll - the wings - do not stay on period. There should be a way to snap the piece into place but there simply isn't. Three days after Christmas and my daughter has given up on this toy. It's like the manufacturer made this toy and never tested the finished product. It's crazy how poorly made this toy is.
5,Cool doll!,I have this doll still in the box and never took her out its really cool when she glows with the lights off she is the best!! her hair and clothes are fairy pretty! now i'm going to get crystal!
3,Just okay,"Even though it frustrated me, my son seemed to pick up on how to use the arrow keys to navigate fairly quickly. You will also have to dig around the site for instructions on how to play the games. All in all though it is a good yet challenging way for him to practice some of the basics. The Reading Blaster 9-12 is great!! I wish that this was set up the same way."
2,Disappointing,The positive emphasis of this compilation - that any and all claims are best meticulously and exactingly examined in an organized manner - is disappointingly marred by Martin Gardner's shallow knowledge and research of the topics he seeks to debunk.
3,Twin Wheel Drops Liquid Motion Desk Toy,These are fascinating for autistic/ADHD children but - the simpler ones without the wheels seem to work better and hold their attention longer.
5,The Wild Wild West - Season Four,"I was very happy to see more of this old series. I would have liked to have seen more information about the episodes themselves, such as the title of each episode, air date, and guest stars. My family has bought several of past seasons; the Wild Wild West is a FUN series that adults can enjoy but it is also appropriate of younger viewers!"
2,Disappointing,"I loved Aled's later recordings (""Aled"" and ""Higher""). I tried this one, hoping for the same quality, but was really disappointed. It's like listening to a completely different artist, almost ... and one not as talented. I don't think I've listened to it even once after my first tryout. Maybe I'll end up selling it...."
5,I wouldn't choose anything else!,"I love these storage binders...I only started buying all my favorite DVD's recently but I have A LOT of CD's as well. The storage binder looks great and keeps my CD's/DVD's in good condition and off my floor, desk, or any other surface that they have been invading lately. I have already bought three, and I'm going to keep buying them until I catch up with my every growing CD/DVD collection! The binders are also good for storing games, without having to have a million game cases all over the room! I give them 5 stars and recommend them for everyone, I absolutely love them!"
3,Average quality,I bought three of these and two actually warp outward. I like the fact that each sheet fit two disks each side but the sleeves doesn't always stay in the binder. The sleeves does slip out from time to time. I will be ordering three more to finish with my DVD collection. I just wish that the cover does not warp out. It is nearly impossible to bend it back without damaging the cover.
3,Not as expected,The books do look nice but they can't hold as much as they advertise...or you can't close them. I ordered extra pages which was a waste since I had to remove pages from what came with it. Also it doesn't hold DVD inserts...the holders are not wide enough. So I had to fold them to fit which took up more space. ! am mostly disappointed with this product.
1,One tiny itty bitty problem,"I bought a couple at a brick 'n' mortar store and found one problem. Tilt the binder... and the discs come sliding out. And I mean, they very easily come sliding out. If you always keep the thing upright, hey, nice storage case. Unfortunately, I waited too long to return these, so now I'm shopping for a secure sleeve I can use in the binders."
2,The show doesn't translate well into a book,"Mostly the same type of humor as the Daily show, which I watch regularly and find hilarious. However, this type of humor seems a bit dry in book form. I never realized how much the funny actors on the show added to the comedy until I read this book.To be fair, I didn't make it all the way through the book. I borrwed a copy from my brother and returned it after reading about 1/3 of it and having a hard time staying awake. It did elicit an occasional chuckle, but overall it seemed like the same joke over and over."
1,"Silly, but not funny.",This can be described as silly potty humor. Not witty or funny at all. Can't believe I wasted money on this. I don't see how any clear thinking American could have enjoyed this book!
1,Inaccurate and ignorant book,"I bought this book hoping for some genuine and sophisticated humor and criticism, I love John Stewart's Daily News. Instead, I found rather shallow and inaccurate (slightly offensive) presentation of other countries in Chapter 9. First of all.....page 211, the map of the Former Yugoslavia is not the accurate map of Country's boundaries. It has Albania attached to it.... Second....Chapter 9 again, page 212, Bosnia and Herzegovina (better known as Bosnia only) was NOT part of Former Soviet Union (USSR). If you don't know the facts and don't care to present them accurately - do not write a book. Or, publish it and let everybody see how ignorant the whole project was. America (the book), would be much better off, if Chapter 9 ""The Rest of the World: International House of Horrors"" was left out completely.I wish I spent my money on something else."
3,Certainly a worthwhile effort,"This was a decent book, although it seemed to strive for the laugh a little too hard in many places, and often fell short as a result. Thankfully, it tries often enough that there are many successful attempts as well.I was expecting something brilliant, along the lines of P.J. O'Rourke's _Parliament of Whores_ (which is a far superior funny analysis of the US government's history.) I got something relatively good. If you're a fan of Stewart or his Daily Show writers, buy the book and enjoy it, just don't get your expectations in the clouds for either the humor or the accuracy."
4,Entertaining....coffee table book,"I bought this for my hubby who likes to watch this show...and he found it very amusing. I flipped through it and it was sort of like a history book that you actually wanted to read because it was funny. It has random pictures, maps, graphs and his own version of how things happened. If you like the Jon Steward show then I would definately would recommend this book for kicks and giggles."
4,"Good book, but the added notes on the paperback are pretentious","Good overall playfulness from writers who are allowed to do whatever they want. Enjoy-able, something to read after finishing a literary work. But the added notes on the paperback is not needed. It's un-funny, pretentious, needless doodling from an unknown professor."
5,hysterical,Loved the book. Great to be able to laugh at everythign going on in this country...and laugh for all the right reasons.
5,Not Your Grandparents' American History,"Jon Stewart, his staff, and his show have become national treasures. Their wit forces us to see in new ways. They have done the nearly impossible: made politics fun. They've brought many young people into the political system. The book is irreverent to be sure, but its humor is not used to mock America, just some of our leaders and our foibles."
1,Garbage,"Jon ought to stick to his ""schtick"" of trying to make a living being a comic. Typical liberal garbage, only not funny."
