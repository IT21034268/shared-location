2,Griffin Docking Station,"While the docking station fit into my radio nicely. The Ipod would not fit into the docking station. If I remove the small clip from the back of the Ipod it would probably fit, but I want to keep the clip on the Ipod."
1,Doesn't work for ipod shuffle,There is a plastic bar that doesn't allow the ipod Shuffle to seat correctly in the dock. Not sure why this is sold as an adaptor for the Shuffle.
1,product design faulty,"bought this product to assist connect ipod shuffle 2G with docking station, however the ipod does not fit on the product - due to poor design of the product. makes the product a useless buy - waste of money.Kuljit"
3,"A bit outdated, but a good book","This is the history of the Sergeants Major of the Army, as of the 9th SMA, Richard Kidd. It was written by a team at the U.S. Army Center of Military History in 1995 and has been ""copied"" by the current publisher. A new, updated version of this book is scheduled to be released next year, so wait for it instead."
4,It shows that Batman is an international hero.,"Yes, it is a very interesting story and it flows well as Batman pieces the puzzle together in his usual methodic manner. What was striking to me was that it seems the artist used Keaton's Batman for his model, something I have not seen used since the first movies comic. The action is a bit hard to follow and I never was much for magna adaptations of American comics, however it is a story worthy of any fans attention and a very enjoyable read."
5,Excellent cookie recipes,"This is a must-have for your low-carb cookbook collection, especially if you are on maintenance, or not on the severe part of the low carb diet. I have been on a low-carb diet for almost two years, losing 25 pounds in five months, then simply staying on maintenance. I started craving baked goods, and realized I was starting to slip back into a high-carb eating pattern. When I got this book, I immediately made the chocolate chip cookie recipe, and it is so good I couldn't believe it. They are crumbly, however if you put them in the freezer they taste as good as Toll-house cookies to me, and are only 2 carbs each. (Watch that you don't eat the whole batch!) The cheesecake recipes are great. I haven't tried the bread, because every low-carb bread I've made has a strange texture, no matter whose recipe I've followed. I intend to continue exploring the recipes in this book. I have learned a lot about how to bake things without the carbs, following the suggestions in this book."
1,there's a reason this book isn't expensive,"I am very disappionted with this one. I own several low-carb cookbooks that have better desserts!!! I have tried almost every cookie reciepe in this book and several other cakes. They required special ingredients that I had to special order and cost alot of money. THEY WERE HORRIBLE!!! Don't waste your money and time. If you need a snack there are other premixed easy to bake products like "" KETO"" cookies and others."
3,Robey Fan,"I am a Robey fan from her work on ""Friday the 13th:TV series."" I would recommend this CD for any true die hard fan of Robey or of ""Friday the 13th:TV Series."" If you are not a fan or do not know who Robey is, then I suggest that you try something else. There are only a couple of good songs on this CD. The best one is ""One Night in Bangkok."" I think that Robey has a great voice, but this CD does not ""rock my world."""
1,What A Piece of Garbage!,"This product is so BAD I was too disgusted to waste my time returning it or asking for my money back. First, the CD does not work like normal software CDs work. You actually have to ""break"" into it to copy and paste the files. Once you finally get the files open you find mostly blank pages with a few paragraphs in legaleese but nothing close to what you need. If you decide to buy this product, hold your nose when you open the package because it stinks!"
3,"Interesting read, I got addicted but the writing wasn't consistent.","I read the book in about two days, the 2-3 page chapters just pull you in....what can I say.The story was very interesting, but the writing not so good. The use of language is just awkward in some chapters. However, I do recommend it as a good summer/winter break read."
2,Doesn't last long,"I've had my toaster oven for just over a year and have used it just about everyday. A week ago it started having issues and now the heating elements are no longer working. The oven size is great, but there have always been a few issues with the unit that you just try to look past. The oven rack was always difficult to pull out. I would actually have to hold down the toaster oven in order to pull the rack out to adjust height. Over time the dials seem to be get more difficult to turn and set the correct temperatures. Also, I would never purchase a toaster oven with a bell signal again. After a couple of months you get really annoyed hearing it every time someone decides to have toast. I think this time I'll try a different brand."
1,Stay Away,"First off, this is the slowest toaster I have ever used. The ""ding"" bell is super annoying at the end of the endless cooking cycle and to top everything off, the thing just stopped working about 1 year and 1 month into my ownership. I would never buy this piece of junk again. (Looks nice though)"
2,Junk,"This thing quit working after about 8 months. It was still under warantee, so I mailed it off (at my expense) to be repaired and it came back working. Now, after just shy of 2 years from the time I purchased it, it quit working AGAIN. I won't be buying this brand ever again."
2,doesn't detangle hair,"I would not buy this product again, not very conditioning. Leaves hair feeling dry and tangled. Doesn't feel like a conditioner."
1,Wrong Item Arrived,"I was given the shampoo, instead of the conditioner. It really sucked, as you can imagine how it is when you wash your hair without conditioner.. Otherwise the shampoo was pretty good."
2,Doesn't really moisturize,"I expect a conditioner to prevent my hair from drying out. This is the first time I've used an organic conditioner. Although the texture is thick like a cream almost, it seems to disappear and have almost no affect when I apply and rinse it off. I then try to compensate by applying more and more, but the texture of my hair is almost the same as if I didn't even use conditioner. I'm trying to be more self conscious about the cosmetic/hygiene products I use but this particular line has been a disappointment."
2,Didnt condition much....,Tried and used a whole bottle. Smell didn't bother me - what did was the fact that it barely conditioned - my hair was always tangled after use. Switched to another organic brand with MUCH better results!
2,Doesn't condition!,"This conditioner looks and feels creamy in your hands but doesn't condition the hair. As one reviewer said, it feels like nothing and even applying more doesn't help. I was very disappointed in this product. I used it in conjunction with the Avalon Lavender Shampoo. The shampoo is very harsh and seems to strip all natural oils from the hair and scalp. Others are commenting on the great smell - I didn't detect much of a lavender scent. It smells sort of like dog cleansing products."
2,not what I expected,"I was hoping for a great organic conditioner that will help my hair to be healthy and look nice. This is not it. It is almost impossible to brush my hair after using this one (I have a straight hair, not curly and crazy) and it makes my hair greasy. Only plus-smells nice. Will not buy again."
4,Nice conditioner.,This is a nice finishing touch to your bath. I think it leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean. I still haven't noticed the thickening effect it promises but I think I still can wait a month more for it.
4,Great for dandruff-dries out hair,"I love this shampoo as a natural alternative to the harsh chemical drug store shampoos. I have found, however, that it does seem to dry out my hair after a few weeks of use. I tried switching it up and only using it every other time I shampoo but, when I don't use it, I get flakes back so obviously it's working for that purpose. I also follow up with the Avalon Tea Tree Conditioner."
2,Not a great product,"I used this in conjunction with the shampoo. It does not restore moisture to your hair, so even oily hair will start to feel dried out if you use both the shampoo and conditioner long enough like I did. I didn't notice any thickening of my hair. Moving on to another product."
4,More body,So far I'm pretty happy with this product. My hair definitely looks fuller and it feels really soft. The only downside so far is the price. It is more than I'm used to paying for conditioner but the results make it worth the extra cost.
3,Disappointing,Ordered this for my nephew and was so excited to give it to him. We put batteries in it right away and he started playing with it. Not even 2 hours later the sound stopped working! That's the main reason I had bought it because it made sound. And it only made sound after you put all the pieces in it. I thought each piece you put in would cause it to make a sound. Wasn't what I expected especially from this line of toys.
4,Great for a 70th birthday gift,"What do you get for someone this age. I thought this was the perfect gift for a surprise party, it fit the bill."
3,It's Okay!,"Quick reading, but not what I expected. I guess I didn't know what to expect. The book did have some good humor!"
1,"Lotion, not eau de parfum","I like Obsession, the problem was that I ordered, Obsession Night by Calvin Klein for Women, the photo showed eau de parfum, and I received Obsession Body Lotion."
5,Love it,I love this perfume. It is light and not overpowering and I have received several comments on how great it smells.
2,Doesn't work for me,"I enjoy the notes and appreciate the scent. I would love to wear this more often, but I can't. The combination of jasmine and gardenia is overwhelming to my palate, although I love it's masculine edge. The white florals are head-ache inducing on me.CK OB is unwearable in warm weather, and nearly unwearable on cool nights. Love it on paper, just not on my skin.Do sample before you buy."
3,Disappointment,"Being a fan of calvin klein I have to say I was quite disappointed, right after spraying it on the scent disappeared very very disappointed."
4,You get what you pay for,"Individually they were OK, but combining UV and polarizer resulted in reflections - fuzzy details when zoomed and multiple reflections when bright sources. But then you'd have to buy multicoated lenses, each costing twice what this set does."
5,A fabulous insight into harvesting our must under-used asset,"In my search for insight into better harvesting and nurturing the intellectual capital at our company's disposal, I stumbled across this book in the Singapore airport. The flight back to the states provided the opportunity to read this cover to cover in one sitting, and I must admit I can't imagine the flight going any more quickly. Stewart does a tremendous job pointing us, as corporate managers and executives, towards practical advice and insight on how to truly get more out of the asset most companies ignore. I had just finished reading Net Gain by Hagel and Armstrong, and their virtual community message ties very nicely with Stewart's examples and advice on extracting and nurturing the intellectual capital in our firms"
2,Steamy 80s Soap Stars star in Movie,"First, I am a Jack Wagner fan; so, I liked the movie just for that reason. The movie stars two Aaron Spelling soap stars and the movie is much like a cable soap opera. The combination of no chemistry between the stars, dark sets, cheap jazz music, and steamy night scenes make for a great made for tv type movie. Not for someone who is not a fan of either star."
3,Spirited synergy,"An energetic option to traditional Irish formula, Kila often has more in common with multi-genre pals Afro-Celt than less ambitious neighbors, though the pace rarely escapes a lively chemistry for something even more meaningfully broad."
2,Too many problems,"Within the first 5 months, I had to send my computer in for overheating...now it's out of warranty, and I have not been able to use it for about 7 months now due to a bad motherboard. While these are regular occurrences for a lot of laptops, I feel like I should've kept the laptop I had for 3 years (with no problems) and just bought a desktop instead. I am definitely disappointed in this laptop."
2,Beware! Not a complete translation,"Indeed, the title of this book is very deceiving, and the previous review didn't comment the fact that this book isn't the complete Man'yoshu, but a selection. Of course, you may say the title numbers the poems, and if you are an expert on the subject, you know that the Man'yoshu has over 4.000, but not everybody has the information, and the subtitle (The Complete Nippon Gakujutsu Shinkokai Translation) will very quickly lead you to error.That being said, this edition has its virtues. It is a polished and careful translation, with introduction, maps, biographies and nice indexes. Nevertheless, if you abhor of uncomplete translations (it is my case, and I was mistaken in my purchase - should have checked more carefully) check the net for the only English version there is: Mr. Honda's The Manyoshu : A New and Complete Translation (by Hokuseido Press)."
2,Garbage,"Bought this in a combo, and worked okay for a little bit. The first issue I had was that the blade chuck (or whatever you call it) came loose after one battery discharge. This meant that I had to take the plastic casing off of the tool to tighten the screws...not a big deal...but a pain (they loosened again, but i used some loc tite to prevent a third dissasembly). Six months after purchase, the tool started to make horrible grinding sounds, and would not operate. From what I could tell, the main reciprocal gearing had become stripped, and the tool would no longer work. It has since been trashed, and been replaced (for now) with a Ryobi cordless and a Dewalt corded that have not had any issues as of this posting.I would look elsewhere for this type of tool, unless you would be using it very lightly..."
3,Pretty good tool but blade holder isn't that great,"For the price it's a good tool. Of course the price wasn't much when I bought it. It seems to run a little strong and you can have trouble starting a cut. The blade holder leaves a lot to be desired. I also had trouble with the screws that hold the blade holder on vibrating loose. I'll have to take it apart and reinstall the screws with Locktite screw Locker. I think this may be the case with inexpensive tools. you very often have to semi-rebuild them. But as I said before, for the price, they're almost giving them away. I recommend it for the price, just heed what I said. There's two screws that hold the blade holder to the reciprocating shaft which is under the rubber boot at the front. You'll have to push that back and use locktite on the screws and put them back in and you shouldn't have any trouble."
3,Month of Meals: Ethnic Delights,"This cookbook had some very delicious recipes, especially if you're on a special diet. However, it lacked nutritional analyses, which are very important for me, a diabetic. I returned it in hopes of getting the third edition, but I found out from the American Diabetic Association that this cookbook has been discontinued as most of its recipes are in another in the series of Month of Meals cookbooks: All-American Meals. The third edition of this series of cookbooks have nutritional analyses."
4,great grooves,"Talvin Singh is a master at his craft, and it's evident on O.K. Elegant tabla rhythms mix superbly with electronic music to create a sublime ambient sound from the Asian underground. If you like ambient music, or Eastern-influenced electronica, you won't be sorry you bought this album."
2,not worth having,"anokha was brilliant (as are the parties), but this isn't. talvin is a vanguard, but he doesn't put together a solid album. much like other trailblazers, he spends more time conceptualizing than editing. most of these songs should have wound up on the cutting room floor instead of the album."
3,Ultimate?,"Boring and uninspired music. If you like dull monotonousness music, well, have at it. Put it on the sound system when it's time to get rid of the guests."
2,Slackin in some areas,"Yo Gotti in the past can spit some raw ish but on this one, I dunno what happpened.....The production seemed too generic, the rapping was pretty average and generic and not that impressive at all, and doesnt carry much replay value....To be honest, id pop in a Three 6 Mafia cd rather than this one....Album was slacking on so many levels, now theres some tracks that listenable, but the rest make it hard to enjoy this album, nothin special bout it at all...This album waz overhyped I believe and flopped horribly.......Gotti can do much better than this.....Wouldnt recommend anyone to chek it out.....2.5/5"
1,Bad quality,"The size is very small. The procelain finished was poorly made, I could see the metal inside, I returned it."
3,my son loved it but it broke,SO THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TOY MY SON LOVED IT HOWEVER THE ARM BROKE THE FIRST DAY WE HAD HIM I AM STILL WAITING ON THE COMPANY TO TALK TO THEM BUT BY THE END OF THE NIGHT TWO ARMS WERE BROKEN I DONT KNOW IF IT WAS DEFECTIVE BUT OTHER THEN THAT MY SON LOVED IT AND JUST LAUGHED AND PLAYED DEFINATELY NOT FOR YOUNGER FOLKS THOUGH
3,Snowball the Polar Bear,"I finally got my Fur Real Luv Cub Friend and I named him Snowball the Polar. My name is Ashely Thomas and I love my polar bear! I love it a lot! I give this 5, 4, 5, 3 stars! My bear and I do EVERYTHING together! I am only 6 but I still know a lot of things with this bear!"
4,HasBro Luv Cub,"Someone I know has this bear. I just had to order it! When it arrived I thought it was defective because I didn't know it had an on/off switch. I requested a refund, which was granted. When I realized there was a switch, I notified the seller to cancel my refund and they told me ""Thank you for being so honest. Keep the bear."" I was so impressed! As for the bear, it is lovable and cuddly and in perfect shape!"
4,Look past the loopholes to the love story inside...,"Now granted, most people are going to take this movie at face value and say how over the top and inconceivable it was, but this is truly a beautiful love story, dating back to the days when people communicated and love grew through letters and knowledge of one another. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves have such wonderful chemistry and great interaction together that it makes this movie easy to watch and love. Yes, the impossibility of it is there, but where the magic of the movie is is the story of two people learning each other, interacting through distance, and eventually growing to love one another. A great movie and love story for years to come."
1,Spaced Out Reviewers,"I usually trust Amazon reviewers on movie reviews, but this time ....NO WAY! This silly, totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment, hoping the movie would liven up. Sadly, it didn't. To those who rave about the film...you must be in another dimension or something. Thumbs DOWN."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed with this film: it had such great potential but the story was fuzzy and the lack of clairity makes it fall flat. Too bad, the actors were well balanced."
4,let's spend some time at the lake house,This is a very entertaining love story with a great twist. Very well cast. Even the guys will like it.
3,lake house,"why does a film like this that almost makes no sense at all get such good reviews? I guess that part is not factored in or people have not seen enough films. Well, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves once again worked well together and did a great job in this film. So she's in 2006 and he's in 2004 and they keep trying to meet. Thought what they do keep impacting each others lifes and they send letters to each other through the mailbox at the lakehouse which he is living in at the moment. It's confusing but if you do what others do and just pretend to not notice it and just deem it cute, then you will enjoy it no doubt. I liked the film in general but the plot is confusing. I even wonder if Sandra and Keanu knew what was going on half the time."
4,Confused! SPOILERS,"Um, I dont really understand what happened in this movie. Was he supposed to die in 2004? I thought she saw the accident in 2006. Maybe I wasnt watching closely enough. I know that when the accident happened she had short hair. Had she just cut it.LOL, I have no clue what the crap happened in this movie. But it was sweet so Ill give it 3 stars AND Keanu Reeves is hot so Ill give it another star!"
3,A strange love story,This was a good but strange love story. A little confusing so wehad to watch it a few times.PBN
1,The house is the most fascinating character in the movie,"This movie proves once and for all that Keanu Reeves cannot act. His wooden demeanor does not create any empathy for the character he plays. And Sandra Bullock obviously has not recovered from the making of CRASH. She wanders through this film with her eyes glazed over, still exuding the ennui of an L.A. woman who has nothing better to do than get her furs out of cold storage. She supposed to be a doctor??? Not very convincing, I'm afraid. Even Jack, the dog, has more stage presence than these two, managing to steal more than one scene from the principals.What could have been an light piece of summer fluff got carried away by its own psuedo-serious message."
4,A VERY SWEET LOVE STORY,"The chemistry between Reeves, and Bullock is amazing in this film. The story is a bit too convoluted, but on the whole, has a lot of heart. Bullock shines as Kate, and brings out the best in Reeves."
4,Lake House,"Good movie although a bit redundent with the mailbox. Stars were awesome, can never go wrong with those two."
2,Clunk,"A clunker. I enjoy romantic movies like ""Somewhere in Time,"" but this didn't do it for me. Sandra Bullock and the beautiful scenery kept me going. VERY predictible. I kept waiting for the plot twist. There wasn't any nor much of anything else."
4,"Cool book, especially for Dan Fans","For a number of years I've been a fan of Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins. Dan Marino was a great quarterback, and we all hated to see him retire. The NFL clearly will never be the same without that flame throwing #13 to excite us all. His last years weren't near as good as the rest of his career, and Dan never won a Super Bowl either, but undeniably during Dan's hot seasons he was the most feared QB ever to play the game. Is Marino the best QB ever to play the game? Maybe not, but when it comes to all-out great passers in the NFL, Marino has to rank high on your list. Beckett's Great Sports Heroes is a good look into Dan's record breaking career. There are some good articles and nice pictures. Nothing really deep into Dan's life here, but Beckett still has produced a good enjoyable read on one of the greatest, those who are fans of Marino like me, and even those who aren't, will find an entertaining read."
5,CORRECTIONS,"Ok, after reading all the reviews, I feel a bit of an obligation to correct some of the entries, especially since the ""most helpful"" one is blatantly wrong on this respect. The movie, it is generally agreed, takes place in Guatemala. this is not specified, though, but it is evident throughout the movie that this is where it is happening. So dont believe that it was in south america, or mexico, or anything like that (though it was filmed in Mexico). How many mayans are there in South America? So I hope that this entry helps. And its not my opinion, but the opinion of my college professor.Oh yeah, and its an AWESOME movie."
2,"Only the war part of ""love and war"" is interesting","This book contains 3 virtually separate stories. The story of Stephen and his comrades-in-arms in the trenches and tunnels of WWI were intriguing, vivid and well-portrayed. The love story with Isabelle was stilted, not well thought out and frankly boring. The future glimpse of 1978 is even less interesting. Elizabeth's quest for her father's past is brief and dropped as quickly and inexplicably as it is begun. The quest for the past for this part of the story seems to be some sort of faulty segue into her own life which is, of course, in some sort of modern chaos. In short, 2/3 of the book could easily have been left out or severely shortened and the book would have been a much better read."
2,Disappointing,I expected much more of this book. The first 100 pages read like a trashy romance novel...which is NOT what I was after. I have been extremely disappointed in this book.
4,Birdsong,"An excellent novel and very moving. I'm at odds with some of the reader's reviews however. I think the fast foward to the seventies and Elizabeth's voyage of discovery about her grandfather worked very well. It is a journey many British people have made or are just starting to make. After reading the book I found that two of my great, great uncles died on the Somme. I found their names on the Thiepval monument (like Elizabeth)... the first of our family to make the trip out there and trace my fingers around the carved names (funny instinctive reaction). I felt connnected to the past and my family history. Anyway, a really good book."
4,"Powerful, moving story","Having recently read ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", it was with some reluctance that I picked up another book that is primarily about the First World War. What swung it for me were the reviews, which were full of phrases like ""deeeply moving"", ""incredibly visceral"". However, I am gald that I read the book, and would thoroughly recommend it. Faulks has basically written a novel about the horrors of war. He has tried to mix it up (with varying success) by introducing incidents/characters before and after the war. However, the main guts of the book is the central character's struggle to survive during the slaughter in the mud of Flanders. This is were the book is at its most compelling. Faulks does a superb job in capturing this nightmare. The claustophia of the ""underground"" chapters is particularly well done. ""Enjoy"" is the not the right word to describe my reaction to this book. ""Respect"" is closer to the mark."
4,Birdsong,"This is a wonderfully graphic account of the First world war and it's awful death toll.As distinct from the 2nd world war when major cities were bombed almost out of existence,the home cities continued to live a civilised existence whilst unbelievable slaughter continued unabated.I Just loved this book."
4,There is a connection,"It has been quite a while since I read this book, which I found excellent and rivetting. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is a personal one: I like a book to have just a little more lightness in it, if only for the contrast (sort of the way the technique in painting of chiaroscuro emphasizes both light and darkness). However, that is just a personal thing, as I say, and it really should have...well, there isn't a 4 and 3/4 star category...There is a connection between the steamy sex in the book and the war. Aside from the fact that steamy sex is always a good read, I think the author intended it as metaphor: sex and death. However, this sex was somewhat depressing in its intensity, no doubt intended to parallel a very intense war. But that's why I choose to withhold my imaginary ""quarter star."""
3,Horror story,"The war scenes were so horrible, I had to skip some. But it was interesting to find out more about WW1. Who knew about the tunneling? Strange way to set up a war novel - bookended by a love story at the beginning that comes to a screeching halt and then the war and then some stuff tacked on at the end about a granddaughter (I guess, but I lost interest, so she might have been a grand-neice.) If you like amazingly detailed and movie-like horrible war sceens scrawling through your mental picture, then you'll love it. I appreciate the war-writing, but didn't really like it much, as a whole. It did make me think of my own grandfather, who fought in that war, with more empathy."
3,"Mediocre love story, memorable depiction of war.","This books is a darn good read most of the time. The descriptions of trench warfare are fascinating and horrifying and will make you remember this book for a very long time. However, the love story, the women who appear in the story and the sex scenes are very cheesy, bordering on the laughable at times. Alot of male fantasy shtick. If you are looking for a great love story and World War I story, read Sebastien Japrisot's ""A Very Long Engagement,"" which contains an interesting and BELIEVABLE female character and a touching love story that works. I would describe Faulks' novel as conventional and overrrated."
4,birdsong,I have read many books about WW1 and this is one of the best. It will stay with you for a long time. Looking forward to the Masterpiece Theatre series coming up in the spring.
3,"Part I & II captured me, however...","I couldn't bring myself to finish this book. Part one was a brilliant love story. It was hard to switch gears to read Part two, until I realized it was a brilliant war story. However, I couldn't bring myself to swith gears again for Part three! It reads more like a book of three short stories than a complete novel. True, I didn't read the ending, which may have brought all 3 stories together, but by that time I was mentally exhausted! I think the author asks a lot of his reader - too bad I couldn't live up to his challeng"
1,"Um, Mr. Faulks? A ""Novel"" Requires A Plot!","Lovely descriptions, (and decent steamy scenes), but for heaven's sake, where's the story, and why do I care? A handful of lovingly described events combined with inconsistently developed characters does not a good plotline make. It's a boring mishmash."
3,Powerful,This book has been the one that I have thought about more than any other over the past 15 or so years. The description of the roll call after the Somme attack is simply heart rending. Very powerful writing from a man who can describe the bond between men forced into the abnormality of the trenches.
5,The best.,"The best movie soundtrack, period. I have collected quite a few and there are always a few songs that I could do without. Not here. From the beginning to the end, you may not be able to fight the urge to dance a jig or sing out loud. If you loved the movie, there is no question that you can't do without this CD!"
5,waking ned devine soundtrack,"Beautiful! Was as lilting and harmonious as hoped for. A must have for celtic music fans. Very uplifting. Good instrumentals, as well as vocals contribute to a well rounded album worth owning, even if one hasn't seen the movie."
5,Waking Ned Devine: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,Was delighted to finally find the sound track for the movie Waking Ned Devine. Music is great!
3,no wings,"I ordered these quickly thinking they had wings just by the photo of the pad on the package (I'm lazy and didn't read the description). But they don't have wings. They are still fine, but not what I had envisioned."
4,Ute razzle dazzles in this superb collection,"What an awesome French record from the German songstress!! While this is a little more pop than what one might expect from Ms. Lemper it is still a very brilliant and gorgeous record. The duet with Art Mengo Parler d'amour is a standout as is the title track, a luscious ballad; there is a cabaresque track, Mes deux amants, and Ute even gets funky on track #6, La vague a femme. A must have for Ute fans, although if you are only into the more classical, theatrical material you may not enjoy this one."
1,GRANDMA MOSES,"Well into her 70s, Rhina Espaillat-Moskowitz is a prodigy in that she continues to write the same sentimental poem over and over again, with the same thumping pentameters and forced rhymes. Her poems are often stories borrowed from the imagined pasts of her Morano ancestors, who fled persecution in Spain for the Dominican Republic, and then persecution in the Dominican Republic for the USA. Always, always, they are noble souls. Yes, always.Though grandmotherish in tone, devoid of vision, and musically challenged, she does pull some of the poems off in this collection. For that I will give her one star, one which I hope she will wear proudly."
4,bauhaus burns like flame,bright bright burning band bauhaus. They took a stand against the serpent of mass destruction. eat me eat your self to destroy the very thing you have set out to defend. In listening to this i have become it.
3,Too verbose poorly organized.,"It is a great and very interesting story. I would recommend it to anyone interested in great construction projects. The author obviously spent a great deal of time researching the subject, players, times, and much more. Too much material was included which detracted from the story. The diagrams and pictures of the important characters should have been inserted into the chapters particulary to clarify the technical descriptions of the construction processes and designs. All in all its a good read and a remarkable story."
2,Poorly abridged audiobook,"This audiobook focuses on the biography of the Roeblings. A narrator does provide brief synopses of the abridged sections. Unfortunately, this only whets the appetite for these sections that would provide greater detail on the actual constitution of the bridge."
3,"Okay, but Ray Harryhausen has nothing to worry about","Sinbad - Legend of the Seven Seas is a little less rushed than usual for a DreamWorks 2D animation, but it still never quite works. The plot feels a bit too TV and the mixture of traditional hand-drawn animation with computer graphics isn't exactly successful, with the CGI coming off as the loser - generally fine for the creatures, though like Sinbad's ship they often seem to lack any real weight that prevents them from properly integrating with the rest of the film. Okay if you're in an undemanding mood, but Ray Harryhausen has nothing to worry about."
3,Amusing and entertaining,"Fairly amusing and entertaining movie, with the only disappointment being the changing of the title character from Arab to Greek. DVD features were good."
4,Pretty Good,"This movie has several big name actors in it but I don't remember there being a big deal made about this movie when it came out. I only got it because it was cheap, but I'm glad I did. It was much better than expected although not top notch."
4,Unique and Stiring,"For all you film score buffs, check out ""Elizabeth."" It is an interesting and intriging blend of original compositions and classical pieces. My favoite tracks include the ""Love Theme,"" and ""Nimrod"" right into ""Requiem."" If you enjoyed the film, you will not be disappointed. My grade: A-"
4,beautiful,"i saw the movie Elizabeth while in high school and i was captivated by the first overture played at the beginning of the movie. plotline, great movie, and historical inacuracies aside; the soundtrack is excellent in capturing the mood, time, and epic that was the Elizabethean era.i would recommend watching the movie and adding this soundtrack to your collection."
3,Good Background Music,"When I got this cd, i expected it to be more like his work with Brothers Creegan, but it is 98% instrumental, sounding like he is just messing around with music. Good music, but more something that i would play in the background, while doing something else."
4,The Legend,"The box set was great because it had lots of songs, including all my favorites and some songs that are harder to find. However, I prefer the voice of an older, more gritty Johnny Cash."
4,burned into your head,"I agree with the Wilco comparison but even more, if you like the Jayhawks but with a little more ""dirt"" then listen to this album. But don't stop there, definately check out American Lo-Fi, their more recent album - it only gets dirtier and better. Near perfect songs: She Shot me Down, and the duo of songs for thieves: Stolen Cars and Stolen Bikes. And if you need a fix of the sweet longing, then by all means, put the headphones on and hit the play on Carolinah so as to really feel like you're in the studio. Near great album."
3,Not sure it does what it claims.,"I am skeptical of this. We did not see any change in my husbands levels. I would like to for him to try again to double check. But, it is hard to spend money on something you aren't impressed with."
4,great class,"If you are interested in the political history of Vermont, this is the definitive book on the subject. Well researched and easy to read, it gives a broad overview of the events and individuals that have shaped the history of the Green Mountain state. This is also one of the best sources for locating more in depth material, with a comprehensive bibliography included. Ironic that this book describing the politics of the most left-wing state in the Union is written by one of the most prominent Republicans in Vermont, the senior State Senator, Bill Doyle."
5,super pack of knowledge for yard care,This is indeed an everything you need to know book about your lawn and your yard care. Highly recommended if you want to know about what to do with your yard problems. Easy to read and understand.
5,na woman's work book,I am thrilled with the price that I paid for this workbook that I had a hard time locating locally. It arrived promptly and was in great shape for being used!
1,used book not always an asset,"I was looking forward to working the steps with this workbook. I had seen this product before and felt that it was the right way to do step work this time around.I didnt realize when I ordered a used step working guide that someone else had chosen that very book to write their step work in. God bless her for writing steps, but to sell your step working guide with your step work written over the pages is not the right thing to do. It is very disappointing to me. I wanted a clean slate, not a distraction.I will have to make sure that I buy an unused step guide from now on."
3,A Book On Biblical Interpretation,"This book is primarily about the way the story of Thomas in the Book of John has been interpreted over the centuries, both by the church and by artists. A lot of attention is paid to whether people thought Thomas touched Jesus or not, and how this fit in (or didn't) with their theological beliefs. The book then takes a bit of a sidetrack by looking at artistic depictions of the event and how they were influenced and the significance of small differences between them (although this might be of more interest to the artistically minded than it was to me).This book did not add much to my knowledge of Thomas, nor to my understanding of doubt. What it does do is give a good example of how the Bible, particular passages and stories in it (and probably other writing in general) are interpreted based on culture, historical understanding and tradition and competing philosophies."
2,Doen't fit 15.6V model 1510,"Not realizing that there is 1500 15.6V Dust Buster model and a 1510 15.6V Dust Buster model I bought two of these for my two 1510 models. My mistake, the pre-filter description does not say it fits the 1510 model. Am providing this review only to alert other so that they don't make the same mistake. Otherwise, the filter seems fine as other reviewers have indicated."
1,"Wrong part again, I wish these company's would inclide better informatiom, hope I can get my money back...","Wrong part again, I wish these company's would inclide better informatiom, hope I can get my money back...Why is it so difficult to get the right part?"
2,"Loved them at first, but ...","These spoons are lightweight, but very strong. Dishwasher safe and non-staining ... I use them for jelly making and even blackberry juice didn't stain the spoon.**UPDATE** After using these spoons for a while, they are not holding up well. The tips of the spoons are chipping and some of the pretty luster of the bamboo is gone.Since I purchased several of these spoons, I have purchased 2 other brands that are far superior to Joyce Chen. I really don't recommend these, but they are functional."
1,It does not work in cars,I drive a Toyota Coralla and bought the Sony Travel Speaker for driving back and forth to work in order to listen to audiobooks. The speakers did not produce enough volume for to be able to listen easily. Now it sits in my trunk.
4,Pretty Good,"This is a good product. I really like the simple yet elegant design. The sound quality is surprisingly clear. Don't hope for too much bass out of these (as is expected for the small speakers). I do not recommend these as the primary source of sound for your music player in your living room. For that you definitely want to invest in something bigger. I think they're most ideal for times when you want music on the go, but don't want to use headphones. In my case, I use it while I'm working as a bus driver (can't wear headphones while driving). Some people have said that the volume isn't very high on these, but on my ipod it's more than enough."
4,A praiseworthy compilation.,"""My Mother's Southern Desserts"" is a praiseworthy compilation of recipes from Jim Villas and his mother, Martha Pearl. Her repertoire of sumptuous sweets is organized by holidays and special events. And each recipe has a side-panel, in which Martha Pearl pens an engaging bit of background on the dish at hand. Being both Southern and a dessert lover, I perused this volume with a growling stomach. A handful of dishes that I wanted to bounce up and bake included Chewy Peanut-Chocolate Chip Drop Cookies, The Delta Queen's Pralines, Chocolate Pecan Pie, and--believe it or not--mango ice cream! The book's layout is superb: Simple red dots and lines seperate the recipes' titles, comments, and lists of ingredients. And there are 16, full-page color pictures at the center of the book. Southern food lovers will crave this work."
2,ok - not so great,"I bought this because I love to read cookbooks and lived in GA for a number of years, so like to read accompanying stories (i.e. Pat Conroy's cookbook) about life in the Low Country and surrounding areas. I recognized familiar cakes but none of the recipes excited me enough to try them. Mrs. Villa's musings are definitely from a time gone by (thankfully) - the Old South is no more. So, spare us the cake called Succession Cake about recognizing the days when GA wanted to separate from the Union, otherwise, I'll have to come up with a Yankee version of that cake - General Sherman's Pie in the Face to the Confederacy. 21st Century Yankee Cook"
1,Don't buy this item!,"I bought this item with great expectations for my 2 yr old grandson's b-day. I was extremely disappointed with the performance of the toy. The train would not stay on the track. After it threw my grandson off of the train for about the 4th time, we tried it outside. He had difficulty steering the train straight and the handlebar housing kept pulling away from the train body. The train startup I thought was very jerky and moved way to fast for the track setup. I returned it to the store last night, of course losing my freight exp. [...]"
2,Not as humorous as I expected,"Being a lab owner, I bought this book as a gift for another lab owner, and was quite disappointed when I received it. It's still a cute book, but I didn't find it to be nearly as funny as I thought it would be."
5,Jesus was a Jew,"This is groundbreaking material that points out that Jesus was born a Jew, was referred to as a Rabbi in the Gospels. With this in mind Phipps brings certain 2 millinium old Jewish traditions to light in relation to Jesus.He makes a convincing argument that we have every reason to believe that Jesus was married and very little reason to think that he was not."
4,Nice Sized,"Nice spatula - renewable resource, environmentally-friendly material. Not much else to say - it's a spatula, folks. All good. Recommend."
1,Dont Buy These--Poor Quality,"I just recieved these in the mail today and the quality is awful. I bought 2 sets and on one set both the metal side holders where detached right out of the box and on the other, 1 side was detached right out of the box. Also on two different coasters the little rubber things on the bottom had one missing. The glue was there but the rubbers, like the side metal holders, were detached. The glass is nice and the white flower pattern is pretty but it will likely not function well as a coaster since it is obviously not durable. If it comes this way out of the box than I doubt there is any durability for long term use. Waste of money--don't buy is my recommendation."
5,Europe In America.,The video tape was in mint condition and I loved watching it. Brought back memories from the 80s when Europe came to the USA. Now if only we could get them back here again. lol
5,Easy take-along treat - Awesome!!!,A favorite around here! With both kids and adults -- especially excellent as someone else mentioned if you eat them from the fridge -- Yum! The vanilla cookie/cracker with creme de cocoa filling are also excellent!
1,Cheaply made jewlery,"The dolphin bead dangle belly ring looks really cute. But only after a week that I'd been wearing it, the dangle part broke off. Bottom line is it looks great on-line, but when you receive the item, you can tell it's very cheaply made."
3,"Very quiet, but not enough memory.","I felt that this machine was VERY slow until I put in a total of 3gigs of memory---now it works as fast as XP. The desktop memory meter says I'm at 50% memory usage, so 2 gigs would have probably been enough.As stated in some of the other reviews, with the on/off button on the top edge of the front panel it is too easy to turn the machine off while moving or tilting the case. Also, it would have been nice if HP would have included a disk copy of Vista.3 USB ports on the front and also firewire. The built in card reader on the front is also very nice. A very quiet machine and it looks good. I'm not a gamer so the graphics look fine to me, but my kids say my $550 laptop has a better graphics card than this.Overall, with the increased memory, I'm quite happy with this machine."
2,Fine,"Works fine. It did arrive with some rust in certain areas. Not a big enough deal to return, but disappointing when you spen that much..."
1,Bread & Breakfast Baking Low Carb II,"This is not a book; it is more like a pamphlet. Most of the recipes are available for free on the web if you look for low carbohydrate sites. Also, the ingredients are difficult to find, even in a health food store. I would return the book if I was willing to wait in line at the post office."
3,Thorough but Frustrating,"For vocabulary and grammar, this is one of the best. My biggest complaint is that the authors throw entirely too much vocabulary at the reader without providing a glossary with the lesson. This leaves you spending a lot of time leafing through the glossary at the back of the book (a big waste of time). Moreover, there are many words introduced that not only aren't translated, but don't even appear in the back of the book. Authors should have been more careful on this point. A cardinal rule of language pedagogy is that you either introduce chapters heavy to new grammar or heavy to new vocabulary, but not both. And make it easy on the learner. This book, while good, is not great for these reasons."
5,Amazing show!,This show is hilarious! They really did a good job with a low starting budget. The actors are all great and very unbelievable trailer trashy!
1,Thumbs Down,"Bland and contrived, the poems in this collection represent all that is wrong with 90% of formalist poetry. For poetry to work, whether free or metered, it must maintain some element of spontaneity and surprise. Juster's poems never achieve this and come off as uninspired exercises."
4,Track 7 is not the right Track,"This album is pretty good, but track 7 ""Kid's World"" is not a Nations by the River song. I've already complained and suggested that they remove it, but no one has done anything about it. You'll notice that the original song is much shorter than the one available to download. What they have here is a classical piece that sounds a little like Aaron Copland...which is nice, but not what I ordered."
5,Excellent!!,"I bought this cd being skeptical of the reviews, peoples have been making about this album. I must say I was pleasantly suprised. Mutter is divine. Her phrasing, and vibrato are very unique, and blows the standard Perlman, Oistrakh, Kremer, and Szyerng versions out of the water. Though I think Orkis, sounded to mechanical, and uninspired in his playing. Overall this album is a real treat, not to be missed."
3,Somewhat self-indulgent,"I agree with the reviewers who gave this set one star...the tempo shifts, contrasts in dynamics, and overuse of rubato are wwaaayyyy over the top. For me, what saves the performances are the technical proficiency of the performers.I still prefer the rock solid Menuhin-Kempff performance, also on DG."
2,6 skis my %&@,try to force even 5 skis into this and the plastic tabs that serve to catch the thing shut round off and then are impossible to close. hmph!
4,Very portable and attractive,"I have the model from last year (Metalica). I don't understand the reviews about this stroller being hard to push and steer. I take my daughter out in it with a dog in one hand and steering with the other. Perhaps those reviewers have the wheel locks on by mistake? (There are locks on the front wheels and the back). This stroller is fantastic if you don't carry a load of stuff with you all the time, want something lightweight, looks good, and is easy to maneuver. The only drawback for me is that the sunshade is too small but for $15 I bought an extender. Maybe this years model has a better one."
1,Hard to steer,"Although this stroller is light, it is very hard to steer. It seems to stick when you try to turn it. It is nearly impossible to steer with one hand. The adult cup holder is weak and flops over when it's holding a cup (therefore it is useless!)"
5,Its good,The album has alot of flow and some good lyrics. Most anyone that likes reggae would enjoy this album
5,Believable fiction about a serious problem,"After I had bought and read this book for myself, and given it to someone to read, I went and bought two copies for a therapist friend to give to religious women patients who had abusive husbands. Written from a Christian perspective, Sadie's Song allows the heroine to wrestle with the question of how God could let her be so miserable. Or is God waiting for her to take the first step out of the seemingly hopeless situation? Among the book's many virtues is its honest portrayal of abuse in a seemingly normal churchgoing family. There are no angels or devils here, just people making wrong choices and sometimes pulling back from the brink."
5,Big surprise,"I got this album solely after the single Rocket Brothers came out on MTV. I had a good feeling about it for some reason, but had a tough time getting the thing. I mean, Kashmir is still a pretty much obscure group in most parts of the world; try Googling them and you'll get very little.But the album is DAMN GOOD, trust me on this. If you like soft rock, this is the kind of music for you. Kasper Eistrup's voice is, thankfully, not the nasal kind and you get the feeling he's really, really honest about what he's singing.Favourite tracks include Melpomene, In the Sand and Sad Poem of Old Friend. Get the album."
2,Very disappointing,"As a huge fan of Steve Haskin's column on Bloodhorse and a yearly attendee to the Derby, I was really looking forward to reading this. Disappointment is an undetatement of my first reaction to the book. How can this guy write such good stuff weekly, yet fall woefully short in his book?"
5,Perfection!!!,"This is exactly what I needed. I have a very old hard copy of The Game of Life and was afraid of it falling totally apart. This mobile version allows me to replay it as much as I need, have it on the go in my iPod, and play as I sleep! I love this technology! I hope other great books are made available this way. With this technology, you can actually have a mobile university!"
4,Great one day read,I'm a big fan of ms.winters. This book was really funny. the romance was there but not enough to hold you over till the next screen. I rated this book a four due to the ending as much drama as this book I looked for more at the end. If you have not read the first two book I strongly advised that you do. (1)A Forever Passion Marcus Hart's story. (2)Love on the Run Bree Hart story. Enjoy the whole Hart clan
4,Pretty Doll,"This is a pretty doll. The face and the hair and the wings are beautiful. I think I got a good deal for my money; however, the bodice of the doll is painted on. I thought it had regular take off/on clothes, but the bodice of the dress is actually painted on."
1,Does not program at all,"I tried to program the doll with several DVDs remote controls, and not a single one worked!"
3,This was a good book,"After two miscarriages I desperatley wanted answers, this book did help some but really didn't offer me any answers. If your miscarriage is due to chromosomal abnormalities this book will not really help - if it was due to a specific condition this would be helpful."
3,Manhattan Project,"The DVD transfer of this OLDER movie looks great in a upconverted 780P source. The story line may be a bit outdated, but cast does a good job. If you liked the old VHS or DVD release, this one is well worth the cost."
3,manhattan project movie review,"good movie, good development teen romance..teen boy genius..teen girl smart too...end of world predictaments..."
2,Revolutionary?,"I'm not sure what's so revolutionary about the material used to construct this basketball. When I purchased it, it felt as light as a foam ball and bounced like a tennis ball. At first I simply shrugged and pumped it some more but because of whatever this 'Zi/O material' is, pumping the ball even slightly makes it start to bounce like a super ball. The grip on it is satisfactory however but I am extremely disappointed by the super-light feel and bounciness."
5,Feminist Theory Review,"I think it's high time the classics were brought back. Too often these feminists classics have gone out of print, and not available to younger generations. It's as viable today as it was in 1984."
5,Autobiography of a modern genius,"Though he's better known now as a filmmaker, Julian Schnabel was also one of the leading figures on the American Art Scene in the late '70s and '80s where, for better or worse, his gigantic canvases and infamous arrogance typified the last years of Warhol's New York. You either love the Schnabel of that period or you hate him. Luckily for me, I thought he was a genius and therefore I enjoyed his autobiography, Cvj. Covering his childhood in Texas, Cvj doesn't carry all of the insider gossip that a lot of readers will probably be looking for but it is a rare and fascinating glimpse into the development of one of the greatest artists of modern times."
4,"ah, summer","a pretty good recording of a summer evening with an abundance of cicadas and crickety insects singing, and it's under 6 bucks. you can't lose. and it's kind of hard to find recordings of cicadas. buy it."
4,Arrived by scheduled dates,My brass swivel eye snap hook arrived on time and was not damaged. I would definitely buy another hook or items that interested me from Papa John's Toolbox.
3,Finding the right cup,"This cooler/warmer works really great at your desk, the trick is finding the perfect cup to conduct the heat or cold correctly."
5,Wings of the Dawn,"Wings of the Dawn is another excellent Guy Howard book, written about the Southern Missouri Ozarks region. Text is about the people during and after World War II, several particular families and the hardships they endured. Very enjoyable reading, some of the locations named are fictious, however, they match up with some real life towns in the area of Branson-Forsyth, Missouri. This is the area in which Mr. Howard preached the gospel for many years. Good readin'"
2,Not as Plump as shown.,"They are OK, but not as plumb as shown. The chocolate coating is somewhat disappointing, not what I expected."
1,not what I expected,"I expected more protein options from this cookbook. It has some great salads but that's it. I like red meat and there are only 2 recipes for lamb and veal. No beef recipes at all. I'm allergic to seafood and I don't like chicken so there aren't many recipes I can try. ""Zone meals in seconds"" has better variety and gives you suggestions to swap proteins for variety."
1,don't buy,"it doesn't work...i thought i could get some use out of the transmitter, but it is scratchy sounding and hardly works---if at all...stay away---spend a little more money and get a better one..."
1,Unsuitable,Very bad experience. I bought it for my 80 GB video IPOD. But it was not suitable for that. So I just threw it away.
3,Doesn't fit Nano or first Two Gen Ipods,"I guess I should have looked more closely, but I bought this to go with my new Nano, which it doesn't fit. Also doesn't fit my second gen Ipod.I have no idea how it works, but this might keep you from ordering one and having to return it.Griffin has a Nano ITrip coming soon (11/20/05)"
1,waste of money,"i was using the tape player for my ipod. but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck, i was forced to go to the fm transmitter. i had expected it to be as clear as my radio, b/c afterall, it feeds off radio frequency. i was very very disappointed. it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter, static can increase or decrease. i know it wasn't because i had weak radio frequency b/c the other stations were perfectly clear. so i blame the transmitter. i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it. i'm glad target took it back."
1,Does not fit an Ipod NANO save your $$$,"I bought this as a xmas present for my sister who got an Ipod Nano....this device will not fit it. SO do not mistake the title where it just says Ipod, it may fit some, but it doesnt fit all of them! ..because none of them fit a Nano that I have seen on amazon & the only other one that says it fits a nano...does not.! what a headache."
1,Don't waste your money,"Do not buy this fryer. After 6 uses the lid hinge broke on one side and the lid would not stay closed. In order to use the fryer we had to lay a heavy object on the lid to keep it closed. Additionally, the plug in the back of the fryer falls out easily. I can't tell you how many times I had to move the fryer over a few inches and the plug came out--I didn't realize it happened and we had to wait for the oil to reheat, causing a delay to the meal."
1,Never gets to temp,"I really want to like this device, it is well set up, easy to clean, but just doesn't work. We have used the unit 3 times and each time, after leaving the unit on for at least 30 min, temp always maxes out at 330 degrees and takes 10 minutes to recover after frying 2 fish fillets.2 of the feet came off within 10 minutes, so i added stick on feet."
5,i love it a great price too,works perfect great price had one previously so i bought my mom one and she loves it it is very easy to use and very easy to clean
1,Does not stick,The darts simply dont stick to the board. They slide and fall down. Had to return it. My colleague has one he bought from big5 which works awesome.
4,"Mr Bean is perfect, the DVDs not quite","I'm sure this DVD set is incredible, and it most definitely will beat the only current existing Mr. Bean related DVDs, which include ""The Best of Mr. Bean,"" a funny, if not cheap ""best of"" reel where Mr. Bean simply reminisces about classic bits, and the Bean: The Movie DVD, a movie which I liked very much, but was sort of a rehashed film, and the DVD was sparse. The VHS including deleted scenes is better. Anyway, this DVD set is great for including the documentary and the other bits and pieces, but nonetheless must lose major points for not including a Rowan Atkinson commentary on the episodes! Grr! What a mistake! I'll still buy it, though, and you can't beat Bean when it comes to laughs."
4,Yes there is missing footage!,"Both the previous reviews are correct. Yes it is an ITV production, and yes there is footage missing from the DVD set. Ones we have noticed: 1) the turkey weigh-in, 2) the dog being let loose at the funfair out of the ticket booth, and 3) we thought there was more around the chair purchase. Still worth the purchase, but why cut-out these segments?"
4,Silliness at its most fun,"It is an absolute delight to have a dvd series that all ages can watch together. Mr. Bean is fun for everyone, my kids enjoy it as much as we do."
2,Mr. Bean-VHS Is Better,"I received my set of ""The Whole Bean""(DVD format)the other day, and was very disappointed. Not only had this format been edited with scenes removed, but its claim to being CLOSED CAPTIONED is false. The VHS cassettes are whole and complete. And, they're CLOSED CAPTIONED for people like myself who have a hearing impairment. My suggestion is stick with the old way(VHS) until they can do the new(DVD) properly and entire."
2,The Turkey bit??,"The bit where bean buys the chair was never in the english broadcast, but...The turkey scene was!The chair bit is not on any PAL release that i know of (english vhs tapes, austrailian version)the turkey scene is.This box set is edited if that scene is not there."
5,Fantastic Comedy,"This is a great collection of Rowan Atkinson's ""squigley man"", Mr. Bean. I have seen these epsiodes many times, and they are still funny everytime I watch them. The DVD set is great - having all of the episodes together plus some extras. One of the best features of Mr. Bean, is that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages. I disagree with those who say the episodes are missing parts - they seem to be the way I always have seen them before. I would recommend this to anyone who loves great comedy."
2,NOT COMPLETE!!!,The title of this set is a lie. It's not the WHOLE Mr. Bean. Some really great scenes have been edited out. I give this a 2 because it's really a disappointment that they cut the scenes down so much. One example is when he goes into the store to buy the chair. They totally cut that scene out.
1,RUN AWAY,"The tunes on this CD are not being paid on a bagpipe, but on some sort of synthesizer. I didn't even recognize some of the tunes they are so poorly ""played."""
3,Memories 2,"Finishing the Series was actually very sad for my family. I hated how they ended the series then and still hate how they ended it now. But I would recommend it to anyone who has the rest of the series. Finish the collection, then cry for more. :("
5,ZAO IS DA SH*T,"Zao is the best, no matter who their singer is although their old singer was my fave. I saw them in cleveland at peabody's and they were so cool. I went backstage afterwards because they are so nice. They are the best band and the best people ever! BUY IT, BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!"
1,Save your money the new X-men game is here,This was by far the worst game I've ever bought. If you don't believe me please just rent it and see for yourself. I loved the comic as a kid and though the movie wasn't great it was Citizen Cane compared to this pile. The character movement was difficult the missions were repeative and the game was just generally boring. Seems like they rushed this game out just for the movie.
3,Only mono (3 pin),"This is only for mono headsets. If used with a stereo headset, you'll only have sound in your right ear."
1,does not work,"this product does not work properly. The earpiece works; but microphone does not work.It did not work with my 2.5 headphones being used in Nokia phones. Seller sent me a replacement, but even that doesnt work."
1,DOA,"Ordered the product as a cheap alternative to a similar cable for Turtle Beach, through a process of elimination discovered the microphone half of the cable was dead on arrival. One half works fine, so I can have EITHER audio or a microphone, but it defeats the purpose of the product if I cannot have both at the same time."
5,Excellent,"I was looking for something a step beyond the normal study, or those things for the masses. This hits the spot. It's for those seeking a deeper experience than most. Everyone can get something from this, but if you've been studying truth for some time, it will help you advance further down the path as opposed to leaving you feeling empty. Excellent CD, made me want the book so I can highlight! REcommendation: if you listen in the car, have a notepad you can pull over and jot things down on or a tape recorder so you can transpose to notes later. It's that good; there are parts you want to remember and work with."
5,Practice tennis balls,"Excellent practice balls, they don't loose their bounce or pressure. Also, they are pink, easy to identify in a bunch of yellow-green tennis balls."
3,Real Options Finally Deliver On Their Promise,Accessible to practitioners but occasionally superficial with some flaws in structure and content real options.
1,...,"This book has WAY TOO MANY errors. The amount of errors and the types of errors this book contains is unacceptable. If the quantity and quality of the errors weren't bad enough, the explanations (if you can call them that) are confusing or incomplete. This book also has many omissions (parts that the authors promise will be included in parts of the book are MISSING!!!). It would be extremely difficult to use this book as a practical guide to real options with all of its errors, omissions, and confusions.I can safely say that I have NEVER read any book with this MANY errors and omissions ... and I have read quite a lot of books on finance, economics, and math.By the way, I and other readers do NOT pay full price so that they can get a ""rough draft."" Readers pay for the final product and readers can reasonably expect a product of higher quality."
1,"Maybe a classic in the making - but a long, long way to go",I am pleased that some other readers believe they can spot all the errors in this book - but are they sure?If you are thinking about buying this book first have a read the particulars in the forums listing the many errors in the book. My advice - recognise the value of the real option you have to delay purchasing this book and wait for the next edition.listing the many errors
3,Be Careful,"I was very excited with my purchase. Never having a deep fryer, I was looking forward to much enjoyment. Unfortunately, I put in too many chicken wings and it boiled over. It went down into the ""works"" of the fryer and we couldn't take the fryer apart to clean it. So ended up tossing it out as now it was a fire hazard. I realize it was my fault, but I don't think it is an uncommon mistake. If you're careful, the price is great and potential as well."
1,The Companions,I tried to read this four times before I deleted it from my Kindle. It is the most boring thing I have tried to read in a long time.
4,Heavy duty...and heavy,"Sturdy, strong bracket that is easy to adjust. All parts included. Instructions acceptable. Bracket is heavy, was a 2 person job for me. Lots of extra parts for different mounting options. No instructions for height calibration. Needs something like extend the bracket to full height and tighten brackets at 10 feet. Not easy to level the rim via the bracket. But for backyard use and installation by someone handy with tools, there are no major issues."
3,A Different Kind of Cook Book,"This is a good book, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. A lot of the recipes were more complicated than I was wanting. It also listed a lot of fast food options which are not ""recipes"". I was hoping for a lot of quick/easy/healthy recipes. It did offer some good tips for eating healthfully and some neat quick snack ideas. Still, my favorite healthy/diabetic cook book is ""Diabet Meals In 30 Minutes -Or Less"" by Robyn Webb."
2,I'm so dissapointed,i don't like it it taste like to much water in it i'm from the island of Philippines i know the real taste of coconut juice inside so i canot compare the real taste of coconut juice sorry
4,Yummy but expensive,This coconut water is great and Id recommend it to anyone who can afford it. The mango flavor is subtle and it goes down smooth right after working out. This is a pricey brand of coconut water. I've seen it cheaper in Whole Foods and YES Organic Market. Only buy this if u have the money to spare or flavor is really important to you.
1,Barely could drink it!,"I have a bout of gastritis and learned that coconut water is the natural way to help relieve those issues while fasting. I tried it and it worked great but I tried two different brands, Zico and Vita Coco. I loved Vita Coco and hated Zico - the more I drank it the more I hated it...will not buy again!"
2,DEFINITELY an acquired taste,"I've never tried coconut water before, but heard it had a lot of potassium. I have a chronic disease that requires I supplement a lot of potassium so I thought I would try Zico. YUCK! I can't describe accuately what it tastes like, but it is not something I can drink plain. There is a taste that hits your tongue the minute you drink, but does not linger after it hits your tongue. The taste is not strong, so I just added it to iced tea, and cannot taste it at all in that. That's why I gave it 2 stars, for the potassium, and I can still drink it, just can't drink it without adding it to something else. I think adding it to juice would work fine, too."
2,Zico versus Naked and Vita,"So far I am not happy with the flavor and taste of Zico coconut water. I can only compare this to the Naked brand, which I enjoy, and the Vita Coco brand that I also like.Zico has less ""freshness"" to its taste, and the lingering after taste reminds me of the canned coconut water with bits of coconut that you find in the Asian section of the grocery store. For whatever reason, the smell is not crisp and fresh also.I have a hard time drinking the Zico straight, though it is fine in smoothies. I give the product two stars only because I can use it in smoothies."
1,Negative Stars - Seriously! ZICO? AMAZON? What are you doing?,Bought the 12 pack thinking it is a great deal. The taste is VERY VERY BAD and BITTER. I don't know what to do with the remaining 11. There is no easy method to return such grocery items on Amazon. Bought other brand from Whole Foods and tasted delicious.
5,Liquid Cocoa Puffs,This my friends is perfection among coconut water. I love all of Zico varieties but this one is the best.
1,Awful,"I usually don't write reviews, but this coconut water was nowhere near the quality of their normal product. I would not drink these if they were free. Very disappointing."
5,Hydrates better than sports drinks AND tastes better!,"Many popular sports drinks have a lot of sodium and glucose as well as other electrolytes and stuff. Their flavoring frequently is nasty.ZICO Coconut Water on the other hand is water with a pleasant coconut flavor and a natural blend of sugars and nutrients found within green coconuts. There's far less sodium than in other sports drinks, lots of potassium, and it can also be mixed with fruit juice to add some nice flavor to complement it (mango and orange are good additions).After raking leaves for a few hours in the hot Florida sun, this stuff not only tastes better, it seems to hydrate faster as well, I feel refreshed and ready for more work quicker than with the regular sports drinks."
1,Want to like it but don't,"I've been drinking ZICO brand coconut water after yoga for a few years. My favorite flavor disappeared after ZICO sold out to Big Business, and my next favorite flavor since the sell out never seems to be available. So I tried pineapple because it was available and I like another brand of coconut water with pineapple, but ZICO definitely did not nail this flavor! I will choke down the rest of the nasty pineapple case and switch to something else...have lost faith in ZICO since they sold out."
1,Not sure what the fuss is about. I didn't enjoy it at all.,"I wanted to try this out because I've heard a lot of good things about Coconut Water and it sounded sweet and tasty.However...it's surprisingly bitter and not...very good at all. I am basically forcing myself to finish the bottle. Adding a spoonful of sugar has actually helped it a lot. Regardless, I highly recommend tasting a bit of it before you buy any large amount. It's probably an acquired taste, and not for me."
2,Doesn't taste like coconut water at all,"Doesn't taste like coconut water at all, I don't recommend this item. you can get another product with great taste."
1,From concentrate,If you like fresh coconut milk I would highly recommend you do not purchase this product. It is nasty - there is an odd taste to the product.
1,Coconut and Lime - O.N.E.,"Ok I agree that coconut water can be an acquired taste. However if one chills the coconut water and adds FRESH I repeat FRESH lime juice to it the taste is fantastic.I consider this essential to natural hydration without chemicals, colors etc.Update:O.N.E. is definitely better tasting, we switched."
1,its really good for you...,"This product is really good for you healthy wise. But if you cant swallow it, its a waste of fricken money!! it tastes like a tangy spoiled milk to me. I bought this for my sister. She and I have heard its really good for you and did the research to follow it up. I know not everything good for you tastes/smells pleasant, so you just put it down the hatch because you know its what your body needs to run at a optimal level. But I cant do it with this. And Ive drank all sorts of nasty smelling health stuff. I just cant get over the connection to spoiling milk. My sister is drinking the rest of our package. But Ive noticed that shes been drinking hers with lots of ice and she doesnt do it every day because its so awful. We will not be buying this again. I hope this helps some of the customers looking at this product (even if my opinion is of the miniority)."
2,Weird salty/sour flavor,"I love coconut juice but I don't love this. I should also mention that I love pina coladas too. Though I understand that pina coladas are made with coconut MILK and not coconut juice, I thought there would be some parallels.First of all, this drink has a strange salty flavor. Secondly, it's not sweet. It SMELLS sweet and pineapple-y, but the flavors just don't coordinate with each other and don't match the smell."
1,"This is coconut ""water"" not ""juice"".",I misread the label. I was looking for real juice - not some water-down passion fruit flavoring. It's like buying fruit punch when you actually want fruit juice. And this is expensive coconut water.
1,YUCK!,"Save your money. Zico Pure Coconut Water is a nasty tasting drink. You don't have to forfeit flavor for nutrition. If you can stomach this stuff my hat is off to you. I would rather drink Gatorade, Vitamin Water, Propel and other sport/replenishing drinks that offer electrolytes AND a palatable flavor.This gross drink does not offer anything more then other healthful drinks. It smells bad too."
1,PURE PREMIUM? I THINK NOT...,Heloooo people do you read the ingredients? Zico is made from concentrate!!! I drink Vitacoco because it has one ingredient NATURAL COCONUT WATER. Zico is a no-go....
1,This is not good,"The taste is bad.. plus it is from concentrate so I dont think it has the same work outrecovery effects.Now dont get me wrong Zito had a great idea on being able to take the drink to the gym orbiking, but I much prefer the new Vita Coco new screw top, they have much better flavorsONE is pretty good but not as good as Vita coco and this one is about as good as thosecans which are terrible."
3,Not for me,"I tried VitaCoco, O.N.E. and Zico--Zico is my least favorite. I could barely taste any coconut flavor, it was like drinking water from the tap. In addition, on the can of Zico it's stated that the coconut water is made 'from concentrate.' None of the others are made this way. Zico states on the can to SHAKE WELL, obviously b/c the 'concentrate' settles and needs this extra step taken. Other brands do not. My advice is to taste test as many brands as you see fit, as some people seem to like Zico's taste. No matter which brand you choose, there are benefits to any kind of coconut water; but to my mind and my tastebuds, I prefer the other brands."
3,Cheapest for a reason,"I prefer coconut water to Gatorade or other sports drinks for re-hydration; in addition to being natural, they are packed with electrolytes and their taste is no better, no worse.Zico, however, is form concentrate. Calling their product 'Pure Premium' seems very misleading when other products are actually pure and this one has been modified. If you're being frugal, this product works fine, but personally, I'd spare the extra few bucks and go with Vita Coco or One."
3,Its OK,"I have had tried other coconut water before. Zico was introduced to me when I was training for Marathon. So I wanted to give it a try. Having come from a country where fresh coconut is abundant, Zico's taste does not quite taste like a real coconut. Having said that its not bad. But other similar product ""Vita Coco"" tasted more close to the real ones."
3,Maybe it's me,"But some of them were awesome - refreshing, clean flavored, and delightfully thirst quenching in a neat, new way. Others tasted faintly like rotting garbage - which rather ruined the experience pretty much, uh, totally... I drank most of these anyway, and eventually went through the whole 12-pack and survived. Could be just me, but due to the times I didn't like 'em, I doubt I'll ever be buying them again."
5,Zico in the bottle is great!,Love the taste...love this product. Reorder over and over.It is refreshing...and curbs your appetite when you are really thirsty and not hungry.Different taste in the box...UGH!Get the bottle.
3,I prefer Vita Coco,I realized I prefer the taste of Vita Coco. It might be because Zico is from concentrate and Vita Coco isn't.
1,taste as bad as spoil water,"i am a huge fan of coconut juice. Living in florida for almost 20 years. i tasted the best source of coconut juice which is directly from the tree. But it's hard to climb the freaking trees. I love Vitacoco, because the taste is the closest to the real taste of coconut. Not recommend zico at all because they have bad quality control, taste horrible."
3,It was a good deal but not likely to buy again,"I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself."
2,100% Natural... from concentrate?!,"Yes, it says ""Made from 100% Natural from concentrate and added chemicals"". Taste like combined un-natural stuff (chemicals), not even close to ""Foco Coconut Juice, Jugo de coco"", which is cheaper and more natural and better taste. Though I gave 2 stars because of the packaging. Decent and looks nice."
5,Best coconut water out there!,"This is by far the best tasting coconut water out there.I tried powered version, o.n.e. and Harvest Bay. Zico tops everyone.I use it during my workout with energy bites. Body doesn't feel as tired after the workout."
2,Fermented/Toward Vinegar,"Maybe because I grew up in the tropics and know real taste of coconut water. I bought from a local grocery store. Tasted like the older coconuts with the thicker white meat, where the water is beginning to ferment. Subtle vinegar taste. But I guess it's not the real thing (direct from the young coconut). Maybe closest to the real thing? I don't know if there's a better one out there. But have tasted sweet coconut water from those asian markets that sell the whole shell but then again there is the debate of the shell being treated with chemicals so they don't brown. The inside itself is not affected so I heard, and that what matters is how you open and pour it. The real deal is the natural organic coconut direct from the coconut tree. If you can find one. Good luck."
1,"Awful, Tastes like milk that frosted flakes have been sitting in...",I found the taste to be really awful compared to what I have had out of REAL coconuts straight from the tree. It tastes like frosted flake milk: artificially sweet. Would not recommend if you like natural tastes.
4,Addicted.,Tastes nuttier than Vita Coco. I usually drink it before I go to bed after a night of boozing and drink one in the morning. No hang overs.
4,Reminds me of Thailand,"When I visted Thailand, a woman offered me a coconut. I nodded and she whacked it open with a machete with all the precision of a samuari, stuck a straw in it and handed it to me. It was decidedly different and unlike any other coconut product I had before. I enjoyed several of these while I was there, and some European tourists asked how was it as we floated by in the canal at the Rose Market. I gave them the thumbs up, but for people used to the ultra sweet and syrupy soda pop drinks and juice sweetened with high frutose corn syrup, they'll likely find the taste vile. It's very light and refreshing and if your taste buds aren't conditioned by overly sweet drinks, you'll probably enjoy this.I gave it 4 stars because the contents say the coconuts are from Brazil and I found the ones I had in Thailand a bit more tasty."
2,Uncontrollable flavor and tastes...,"I understand this is a natural product and can have seasonal shifts.. however, there must be a way to test for sugar, salt, and element content to determine it's taste and flavor.I find the product to have HUGE quality swings from carton to carton. Some sweet, some bitter...I actually got food poisoning last summer from a zico bottle and it was well within the expiration date. This wasn't pleasant...I will no longer be purchasing the zico 1 liter thai coconut water... I may give the brazilian coconut water 1 more chance. Otherwise it's VitaCoco 100%"
2,Used to be good...something changed,"I subscribed to this product after reading the reviews and deciding this was the best bang for my buck. The first shipment tasted fine, I was pleased with my decision. The last two shipments though have tasted off. They taste kind of like bread or cardboardy I guess. I don't know what happened but I just cancelled my subscription. I thought maybe it was just a bad batch, so I waited for the next shipment but it was bad too.Perhaps my first shipment was the bad batch :-s it's a shame, I really liked the first shipment and I'm trying to use coconut water to wean myself off soda. Oh well."
1,"Far from ""natural""","This coconut water is completely disgusting. I normally buy brands like O.N.E. and Vita Coco, but it has been hard to find them in stock recently. I've seen Zico, so when it went on sale at a local store I decided to try it. I didn't take the time to check the ingredients because I assumed it was like the other brands, pure coconut water.First off, this is ""from concentrate"". They defend this on their website, but don't be fooled. It affects taste, quality, and nutrition.Second, they add ""natural flavors"". There is nothing ""natural"" about a ""natural flavor"". It tastes fake and has a nasty aftertaste.This is by far the WORST coconut water on the market and I hope they will listen to consumers and actually make it ""natural""."
1,Disgusting. Tastes like sour milk. Not sweet at all.,"Coconut is my favorite anything. So i was excited to finally try for the first time cocnut water. To my dismay and utter disappointment. It was truly disgusting. I thought it was actually taste like cocnut, but alas it does not. It taste like sour milk mixed with tap water. Take it from a cocnut lover...find a different product!"
4,refreshing,I have tried various brands of packaged coconut water but ZICO comes the closest to the real thing. It used to be procured from Brazil but now they put a sticker covering that and now its from Thailand (i think)
4,This stuff is great!,"What this is: coconut water - not coconut milk - flavored with chocolate.Coconut water is taken from green coconuts - they haven't had the time to form the meat or milk yet. Plain coconut water is cloudy-clear, and doesn't quite taste like coconuts. It's packed with electrolytes, and doesn't carry a lot of calories. I like Zico's plain coconut water better than most of their competitors plain product.This chocolate flavor is excellent imho. It's not horribly sweet - kind of like a dark chocolate drink.Price compare: the local chain store (with the bulls-eye logo) has the plan or flavored bottles at about $2.50 each, so this is a good ten bucks cheaper (as of 22jul12) than the local market, and I don't have to drive over to get it.Among the big benefits for me is it provides a good helping of potassium, about as much as a banana, and is not loaded with sodium.About me: I don't see anything special about delivering what you promise so I very rarely give ""5""-star reviews."
5,So much for so little,"A ton of coconut water, fo so cheap. One of my favorite bands, came well packaged in this shipment! Get it."
3,Not so good!,"Something is missing! No longer tastes like pure coconut water, maybe its being mixed with water but the taste has deteriorated.....I will be shopping a different brand..."
4,Lotte vous conseille...,"A ne pas rater, tout ceux qui aiment Renaud, l'éternel Renaud, l'immarscessible Renaud seront ravis par sa prose envotante et malheureusement stérile."
3,needs a better discription,this magazine came in decent packaging was decent ... it could have been better... and the magazine came with a huge crease right on the cover... not cool!
4,High-quality seed mix,"I have a female ringneck dove. I got this mix for her as a replacement for another pigeon and dove mix, as the one I had used previously had whole peas that I worried would be a choking hazard.The seeds are clean and smell fresh, and my dove does well on this mix. As is typical for doves, though, she has her favorite seeds and will pick them out first, tossing everything else out of her dish in the process. (She is especially partial to the safflower seeds.)Overall, I would definitely recommend this seed mix."
2,Boriing,This story is a typical run of the mill mine story. I purchased this Dvd because I like Mimi Rogers and she usually is a good actor. This is a B movie that will put you to sleep if you are the least bit tired. Not really worth watching.
5,Wonderful CD,CD arrived quickly and was in excellent condition. The case was slightly cracked but that could have happened in transit.
1,The man doesn't take his own advice,"I took Riedler's course over 30 years ago. Even became involved as an assistant in the course. Unfortunately, he showed his true colors at one coarse. He was dumping his first wife at the time and shared how his lecture partner, a previous student, was his new love. At the same time he verbal attacked one of the assistants, whose wife was in the session as a student. He said the assistant was paying all attention to the ""pretty"" woman in the session. Luckily, there were mental health professionals as assistants who quickly pointed out how wrong he was and how the ""safe"" atmosphere of the session was destroyed by the accusation. Even the wife of the assistant said how wrong he was.He is a fake. Do not give him any money."
4,Richly textures,"In the preface it is said that this is a book to be read, re-read and read again. Just so. The stories, characters and nuance are rich and deep. Enjoyable the first time, I wonder how much more will be seen the second time through. Strangely, I look forward to reading it again."
3,MONICASALMASO,"THIS IS NOT ONE HER BEST RECORDING, IS FINE TO LISTEN tTO BUTAT THE END NOTHING STAY, IF YOU'RE GETTING TO KNOW HERBUY OTHERS RECORDINGS FIRST. nelson"
5,Best American Girl Movie Yet!,"I have viewed this movie twice in the span of three days and even though it does not follow the books (what movie does?) I believe it is the best production so far. The girl that played Molly was excellent and looked exactly like the illustrations in the books. When not comparing the script to the books, this movie gives a very good look at what it was like to be at home when someone dear to you is involved in a war far away. The range of emotions experienced by Molly, Emily, Jill and Ricky were wonderfully captured. The changes in the role of a mother/woman during those times was exemplified by Mrs. McIntire and the patriotism that was so evident during that period of history wonderfully portrayed.I would highly recommend this movie to both adults and children."
1,No movie on DVD --- How disappointing for grandchild at Christmas,"In November I ordered the American Girl movie ""Molly"" from Jonathan Zuchowski for a Christmas gift. My grandaughter lives in another city and by the time she viewed it our return possibilities had expired. How sad she was and so was I that she was unable to view her ""favorite"" of the series. There was no picture on the DVD. I have always had such good experience ordering anything online but this was a total waste of Christmas money and joy for a grandchild. I will have to buy the movie again for her but am a little apprehensive to try the Amazon list."
3,I Give Up,"The problem with expressing an opinion on a complete set of Gustav's symphonies is that it is a task that requires months/years of close listening. I lived with this set for about 2 years, and simply did not like it. His original set with the NY Phil on Columbia (now Sony) is much, much better.These recordings come late in his life, and his outlook seems to have changed significantly, but not for the better. His tempi are consistently slow, and seem to reflect a jaded, disillusioned outlook on life. Gone is the youthful, impressive, happy attitude, here replaced with a gloomy, grey, old fart vision.On the positive side, it is always reassuring to have sure hand at the rudder guiding you through such treacherous waters. On the bad side, I do not appreciate being growled at and told to sit down and finish my cup of coffee.I absolutely do not recommend this set. A more edifying set of performances worthy of your life force is easy to come byMahler: The Complete Symphonies ~ Bernstein."
4,Indespensible when you need a comprehensive histology source,"This is a well organized text/atlas of histology that includes a modicum of histopathology as well. In my experience as a PGY-3 pathology resident, I don't refer to it very often, but when I do I find it to be indespensible. I have not come across any histology book that is quite so comprehensive. In addition, it serves as a fairly good quality atlas. My only criticism is that I would have liked to see more charts and tables with regard to immunohistochemistry and special stains."
1,Pretty sure this is a knock off version....,"I love the real version of this product-but the one I got--the label was not even attached...cheap box..cheap metal on top..blurry photo on the label, smell is not like the real stuff-watery looking."
3,Realistic about the situations,"Hi, I did When Rain Clouds Gather in my 11 Grade, im From South Africa! This Book Stimulated my thoughts about what happened here in this part of the world, the stuggle and the Lack of equal Rights! It also made you wonder, how many African Children Didnt get an Education or an Good Education! This is a Book that i would advise you read, its Honest, tells it as it happened, or in some case in Africa, as it still is happening!"
4,"Swell, if you don't need carbonation.","Tastes like you're drinking a handful of liquefied apple flavor jolly ranchers. A little too sweet, but good. The low price and prime shipping from Amazon is a big plus too. It's hard to give up carbonation though."
4,Energy Drink,"Tastes surprising good. Seems to refresh your body, or at least cure your thirst. Also quite a conversation piece when giving it to someone."
3,Another quick read,"Easy reading - not very deep. A point of view of the European experience leading up to the present political environment with a generalization into a direction for the future. Good background on the creation and importance of the EU for us folks across the pond. The second essay posits five maximums leading to the conclusion that the ultimate goal of the political process should be to help people redefine their identity into a larger context. Harris, in ""Civilization and Its Enemies"" traces the process of redefining individual identity over history. His work builds on the work of Fukuyama in ""The End of History and the Last Man."" I though Harris' history and argument more persuasive. As such I did not find Cooper as enlightening as I had hoped."
2,"Reads with dumb IR undergrad vibe (pretentious, uninformative)","I read this book a long time ago. It reads like what you might get if you asked a typical IR undergrad's thoughts: short, confused, abstract, littered with unnecessary and oh-so-intellectual neologisms. And the book literally has no point. He does not describe how he came up with his 3 categories of state (pre-modern, modern, post-modern), how we move from one state to another, or just his neo-Whiggish assumption the post-modern (European, of course) state is the inevitable end-product.A waste of time, another piece of waste-paper in the contemporary IR debate. Put it beside the rest of the one-track-minded garbage of Huntington, Fukuyama and Kagan.. (And I think of the Cold War generation of IR writers and intellectuals, Raymond Aron, George F. Kennan, Walter Lippmann, we really are being poorly served!)"
1,"CRITICALLY FLAWED, but great support from Logitech","Mine broke in just two months of use, even though I was extremely careful with them. Just as other reviewers here have already said: THEY WILL BREAK. I taped the snapped headband and continued to use it, but a week after that the battery refused to charge any longer. I'd expected Logitech to make better stuff than this!However Logitech wowed me with excellent customer service. I called the support number given on their website for warranty service (866-291-1505), and they offered to replace it with their Freepulse Wireless Headphones. All I had to do was fax them my receipt, didn't need to return the broken one.Silver lining: The broken headset's USB-to-Bluetooth adapter can be used with the new headset instead of using the headphone-jack-to-Bluetooth adapter it comes with."
4,get the one for ipod if you have laptop with bluetooth,"this headphones is same as the one for mp3, that does not support AVRCP (prev and next buttons are not available)if you want AVRCP, you need to get one for ipod (the white/grey with ipod audio adaptor), it can be used on desktop and laptop with bluetooth + a2dp support (passcode 0000)since the headband is broken easily, reinforcement is requiredcut a plastic strip from plastic card (unused credit card is OK), use a scotch tape to hold the plastic strip close to the headband (the location where is likely to break: middle toward your head), apply Krazy glue slowly till the gap is filledafter the glue is dried, wrap it with nylon packaging tape nice and neat, and tightthen your headphone is safe from breakingconclusion: if you know how to reinforce the headband, get it, the price is simply a steal, and the sound is good too"
2,I was careful!!!!,"I love these headphones, walking around with my Ipod on my desk and being able to skip tracks or pause the music when I have to talk or listen to somebody is great! Now the bad news, despite being very careful with the headphones, they do crack no matter what. I have two pair of these and despite my delicate handling, they both have developed cracks in the middle of the head/neck band. They still work and haven't separated entirely (maybe the glob of gorilla glue is stopping further separation) but when you read about them breaking...they do."
2,"Very Good Writing, the kind of book you can't put down","The other reviews are pretty right on regarding the contents of the book. The only criticism I have of Wambaugh's writing is that he intersperses quaint/trite little comparitives like ""more complicated than Lebanese politics"" so much in the story that often it distracts from the intensity of the story, and leaves you wondering just how much more of the compelling story was written with tongue in cheek."
1,Tattered phrases; interminable progression,"I began thinking this book was a parody of a detective novel and then found I just had to finish it to find out exactly what drove Mr. Wambaugh to fall so far from the excellence of his watershed book, The Onion Field. I never discovered his motivation, but stand convinced that this work is over-researched and poorly presented with a combination of well-worn detective book phrases and redundant event coverage. I cannot recommend this book to any serious reader."
4,PART 1 OF TWO PART SAGA,"I cannot be too critical of Mr. Wambaugh's book because the movie based on the book drew my attention to the murder mystery. The case is interesting because so many questions are still unanswered and there is no clearcut version of what really happened to Reinert and her children.The real failing of the book is not telling the whole story, which is not Mr. Wambaugh's fault because it took another ten years after the trials of Smith and Bradford for the final act to hit the stage.If you become interested in the story, read Echoes, watch the TV-movie which appears on Lifetime several times a year. Finally, you must read the final chapter of the story: Principal Suspect, which provides the conclusion of the legal proceedings but leaves one major question of the case unanswered.Both books and the movie are worth the time spent on them."
4,"Compelling Reading of a Tragic, Tangled Story","This is a chilling story of deceit, ego, and murder. Author Joseph Wambaugh captures much of the tangled story with vivid effectiveness - a tangled story where the truth proved rather elusive. Susan Reinert was a high school teacher and divorced mother of two in Philadelphia. Tragically, her lover, department chair William Bradfield, and the school principal were ruthless and unscrupulous. Bradfield was an egotistical womanizer, while the principal apparently dabbled in sadism and weapons. The tragic result, apparently, was a family of three murdered. Reinert's body was found; her kids merely disappeared. In time, her associates were charged with the brutal crime. The book makes for compelling reading, but the mystery was never entirely solved, and the book may leave readers wanting more."
1,Unsatisfying True Crime,"This account contains too many poorly drawn victims and perpetraters, all of which the author claims are beyond stupid. It makes for frustrating reading that, without at least one intelligent central character, lacks tension and suspense. Instead of an intriging chess match of worthy and fascinating opponents, it reads like a dark version of a Keystone Cops/Three Stooges caper that grows very tiresome about half way through the book. I am surprised so many readers found these people interesting and that the author who is so obviously contemptuous of the all his subjects (the manipulated as well as the manipulators) could sustain his interest long enough to write this book."
5,Lingering Contrails,"History of the 94 Bomb Group, 8th AAF in WW II. Slate wrote the complete history from beginning to end. His mission by mission account is complete and accurate, yet he maintains an easy narrative, interspersed with personal ancedotes from combat crew members. He knows because he was there, as a pilot. I believe it is the best acount of a Bomb Group I've read and I've read many. Also I was a tailgunner in the 94th"
1,Estoy desilusionado,"Leí esta novela porque quería leer algo sobre la guerra sucia y me quedé muy desilusionado con este libro porque aparte de las pocas referencias a la dictadura, la trama se basa en las vidas vacías y patéticas de los personajes, que en mi opinión habrían sido tan desagradables aun si nunca hubiera una guerra sucia. La novela no logra formar la relación entre su pasado y sus acciones al día. No puedo recomendar este libro y me da pena porque muchos cuentos de Valenzuela me han agradado mucho. Sin embargo, esta novela me dejó vacío por lo que no hizo."
5,Tarzan Movies Vol 1 & 2,Good customer service. They came quicker than I expected which was great because it was part of an anniversary gift to our son-in-law who was totally excited over these. He said they were great. I bought one new and one used. No problems with them.Thank youL. froml Calif.
2,Not for me,"I have tried listening to this cd several times now but the strident sound of tenor Jonathan Ansell spoils it for me. Did the record producers not hear this as I did? Bohemian Rhapsody is an interesting choice for a group like this as was Circle of Life. However I am afraid there have been better groups before them (Amici, Il Divo & Blake)and I am sure if it wasn't for the hype and emotion associated with reality shows like X-Factor this group would have never been heard - which would have been a good thing."
1,Non protective fender,I have a '92 seadoo GTX on which this fenderwill not fit Properly and tends to fall off.I also own a seadoo 3D and it will not acceptthis fender at all .A waste of good money .
1,Jet Ski Disappointment,I own four jet skis and I am always looking for ways to protect them from the dock and wave action. I was hoping this product would be helpful. Unfortunately it doesn't work!
4,Honestly - this is the #2 source for you.,"This book has some great advice in it along with some excellent cover letters. The resumes are very professional in appearance, but the layouts really aren't that interesting. This is definitely an excellent second source to have on your shelf! You should only need two books on resumes (this one and the one I've listed below) to get the job you're looking for.Let me tell you, I have just read through four resume books specifically aimed at teachers (this book, the one listed below, Resumes and Cover Letters for Teachers, and 101 Grade A Resumes for Teachers). If you want the ultimate book, you should take a look atExpert Resumes For Teachers And Educators (Expert Resumes). Between these two books you should have all your bases covered!"
5,Outlines outside forces which tend to drive couples apart,"Plenty of titles provide marital advice; but few so clearly outline the outside forces which tend to drive couples apart as William Doherty's Take Back Your Marriage, which tells how to stick together in a world which pulls people apart. Family therapist Doherty says today's divorces are the result of conflicting demands on time and money - troubles which can be overcome by determined couples. This tells how."
5,Free At Last,"Received item as described, fast delivery, will purchase from vendor againThank youM Haynes"
3,A Re-release with bonus tracks,"I have the original F**k You CD, I noticed that the band added some more tracks from the newer CDs. I liked the original F.Y. CD. One has to remember that Overkill was not one of the biggest bands in the Eighties. These Guys torn it up Underground, in small venues. The sound quality matches this type of arena. Remember these guys are not a bunch of pansies singin' girly songs. These guys put out some good METAL. Explore and enjoy!"
4,Triple Play,"""Triple Play"" is the first Jake Hines mystery by Elizabeth Gunn. The series is set in Rutherford, MN. James Wahler is found on a softball field brutally murdered, dressed in an old softball uniform, and has metal cleats on his shoes. Later, Frenchy LaPlante is found brutally murdered wearing the same type of uniform that Wahler was found wearing. Jake Hines and the Rutherford police department, along with the state BCA, investigate. They know that there will be a third victim if they don't solve the case soon. I really enjoyed this book. Elizabeth Gunn has written a very good debut novel."
2,Rip-off,"This just costs too much for what you get. I think, originally it cost about $12 but now is selling for $50+. I was very foolish for purchasing it."
2,Too few long pieces,"Like everyone else I remember Lincoln Logs from my childhood. This set has so few long, or even medium pieces that it is very limiting in just free building as opposed to the ""set"" that is pictured. I suppose we'll have to go to all the yard sales to try and supplement. Should have done that in the first place instead of spending this much money on this set. Disappointing."
4,it's a razor,its a good razor not all the stupid tilting and not a tri blade or quad blade just a double blade simple razor
4,fantastic product,My husband and I use these cartridges and we have for years. I have tried many other womens razors and keep coming back to this because it gets a closer shave. I just wish the company would continue to make this product. I gave it 4 stars due to the price I had to pay.
5,Finally found these,"Been looking everywhere for these.Tried other razors,don't care how many blades they want to add to them they just don't give you the same shave as these blades do.Best shave I've had in along while.Will buy from seller again."
1,Pathetic,"This book is simply a rehash of the source code so don't bother spending 60-some dollars when there are better books on the subject. With almost 900 pages, you might think you're going to read a detailed technical presentation of the TCP/IP Linux source much like Wright and Stevens did for BSD. Well, look somewhere else, like the Linux source, because that's all this entire book is with little, if any, added value."
3,slightly off center,"I really enjoyed the first two books inthis series, but I found the third a bit disappointing. I would have liked a little more on the other brothers, as opposed to the heavy focus on Mikhel. I guess I'm a prude also, because I found the love scenes between khyiel and thierry a little too descriptive for my hetero tastes. It would have been better if it were a little more balanced by Nikki having a hot affair with someone, anyone! Anyway I'm glad that she did take the chance with that type of writing although I'm sure she lost some readers over it. I like where she's going with mirym and the rest of the cast. I'll be reading the next book with high hopes."
1,Instant Persuasion,"This read was just plain common sense tactics and approaches. Unfortunately, the book reiterates common everyday ""people"" manners that I believe most already have attained. The approach revealed is is nothing short of old information."
5,A pleasant surprise,"This is undoubtedly one of the best bluegrass instrumental albums - if not the best one - I have ever listened to. Well, perhaps not strictly bluegrass but anyway the music is very enjoyable. This was the first Butch Baldassari album I purchased but surely not the last one. Thus, warmly recommended. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Almost perfect,"Let me begin by saying, I absolutely love this product. The only reason it does not get a 5 star in my mind is the exact reason why some one gave this product one star. Its so sleek that unfortunately the only way to control the system is through the remote.. so if you loose or break the remote, you are pretty much done with the speaker system.Other than that, the system is just a wonderful addition to any apartment or house or kitchen (in my case)"
2,mixed bag,"I got this CD because i had heard ""Un Enfant de Toi"" (a lovely but sad song about a man whose wife died in childbirth) and I continue to really like this particular song, but the rest of the CD was a disappointing."
5,Tbe T3 Domed Duality Iron is awesome!,"I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to try the T3 Dome iron prior to purchasing, as a friend of mine has one. After trying hers, I could not wait to get home from our weekend trip to order my own. I love it!"
1,Awful,"This is the worst ""hair iron"" I've ever used. I originally bought it based on magazine descriptions/articles, especially the one about this hair iron being used on Jennifer Aniston's hair, by her hairstylist, and a picture of her great hair next to the product. I used it and no curls waves or even correct flattening. AND I do know how to use hair irons. This is the most amped-up talked about hair brand of hooey. One of my degrees is Marketing, and all I can say is these people did a pretty good job of making a big deal about nothing in the hair world. These products can also be bought at Sephora--which speaks highly of this company. I wish I took it back, now I'm stuck with it. Do yourself a favor and get a CHI CHI Nano Technology 1 inch Ceramic Flat Iron--a real hair iron, those people don't even need to over-advertise, their product speaks for itself."
1,"Horrid, Absolutely Horrid","No stars, if that had been an option!Having had an interest in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot phenomena for the last 30 years I thought I would rent this from my local Hollywood video. I was so incensed at how bad it was I was tempted to take it back and try to get my money back.Lance Henrickson is generally a good actor, but he couldn't even save this abomination.The cinematography was horrid, the props were horrid, and the plot/story line was horrid.Do yourself a favor. Skip this one."
4,Sasquatch,"Pretty good movie... Bigfoot has not been featured in movies recently and it's nice to see that they stay true to the myth unlike Beneath the Lock Ness where it doesn't. The acting of the leads is good, but there's the odd one that not that great. One does not really see the creature much in the movie until the end. There is an interesting visual concept going in the moviethat keeps the viewer disoriented and wonder what they just saw of the creature if anything at all was shown.. over all a good indipendent movie from Canada."
2,Not a bad film but......,"I have been waiting over 2 years for this film's release. It wasnt bad, but being an amateur researcher on the actual legend, I wasnt all that impressed with it for several reasons:The editing was bad, the creature itself at the end was nothing like eyewitness descriptions, it wasnt even the same makeup they used for the glimpse shots of the creature in most of the film. Original footage shot was combined with reshoots. It could have been better, but what do you expect when you film a movie in 12 days? Thats not a typo either. The film WAS shot in 12 days."
5,A thoroughly interesting book!,"Down here in Brazil it's ard to get your hands on an un-translated sci-fi novel, so I was specially gald to have borrowed this one from a friend. It's an entertaining story, that you can read in a week or less. It deals with the final future of mankind and the last 50 pages provide an equisite and unpredicable ending. As the spaceships soar over Earth's skyscrapers for decades, I found myself as anxious to find out more about them as the book's characters, who lived in the city below. A truly great read."
3,Childhood's End (Not a book I would pick from the shelf).,"'Childhood's End' is a science fiction novel where the world changes drastically. The Overlord's come to earth and take over all humanity. The humans accepted them, mostly because they were kind and giving them a better society to live in. The Overlords may have offered the Humans all one could wish for, but there always is a reason to be nice. There were some who had their suspicions.I did not like this book because I'm not a Sci-Fi fan. The book is based on Arthur C. Clarke's imaginary mind. As in its not what the generation of today believes in but what scientists predict based on their hypothesis. It's pleasant in the beginning of the book when earth is a perfect society, but I hated the later half to the end, because of all the evil. I would not recommend this book."
2,Sadly diminished,"Although I have enjoyed many of Arthur C. Clarke's books, this is one that made almost no impression upon me. Perhaps I've gotten used to the conventions of the genre which this book in part set up from scratch, but knowing that a book was groundbreaking in its time and now simply reflects standard cliches does not make it any easier to enjoy. The aliens, despite their initially mysterious behaviour, turn out to be all-too-human and banal; the touching but rather juvenile faith in the UN and other world institutions that permeates most of the book reeks of 1950s transnationalism; and the mystical aspects of the book are rather amateurish and anti-intellectual. Compare this to Theodore Sturgeon's To Marry Medusa and you will find Childhood's End seems like an appetizer in comparison to the literary feast that Sturgeon presents on a similar topic. Unless you're eager to explore the antecedents of modern sci-fi cliches, I can't honestly recommend this novel."
4,Very cool albeit slightly depressing sci-fi classic,"This was my first Arthur C. Clarke book and it definitely will not be the last. It is a chillingly humbling story about the ""invasion"" of Earth by some alien guardians with a secret mission. The story is very creative and brings us through the limitless galaxy of Clarke's imagination and curiosity. Some of Clarke's vision came true, such as our ability to determine paternity and much more efficient air travel. The book serves as a reminder about the ""smallness"" of Man and the possibility that exists beyond the minuscule world we are aware of.As alluded by the title of the book and this review, the book is melancholic and quite depressing. I certainly hope that Clarke's other books aren't as negative. I think that when and if intelligent alien life were to come to Earth, it would indeed be the end of mankind's childhood phase."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"I have not read this book before and I would have to say, I would have preffered to have this in actual Audio Book form. I was kind of hoping this would be more like an Audio Book but with actual actors portaying the different characters. This, instead, had loud sound effects (cheesy 40's style) and no real descriptions of the scenes like a narrator would have given. I felt more like I was listeneing to a movie more than anything. If you like older radio programs, you will probably like this. It is too bad that this was my first experience with this story though. I imagine that the full story and narration is amazing. This was so short, I was left feeling like I had missed most of the meat of this book."
2,I found this book to be rather dull.,The beginning was somewhat unclear and vague. The plot seemed dull
5,Paved the way for Independence Day...,"By far one of the best ACC book's I have read.Very thoughtful & provoking work by the master of science fiction. Kalleren, Stormgren, Jan and George really come alive.Clarke poses the real question of if the stars are really for us, and can be rivalled to a thinking man's Independence Day, but, in my opinion, a lot more engrossing."
5,Innocent look at a First Encounter,"Clarke has returned to the ""First Encounter"" theme several times and from several points of view. They all have one thing in common though - the workings of the alien races are at first utterly mysterious, a puzzle for humans to solve. But slowly, over time, we learn the true purpose (always something other than what is generally conceived).At least he does not fall into the trap of an INDEPENDENCE DAY or any of the numerous copies in which Zoogoo from the planet Glowboh tells us mean Earthlings to stop our atomic testing or we will be destroyed. Perhaps Clarke is trying to say that the difference in cultural perspectives are so great as to make it difficult to understand the workings of such higher beings.This is a rather innocent book that has retained its charm. Of course, the weak points are character development, the strong points being the plot line itself and the ultimate realization of our destiny."
4,Great Speculation!,"""Childhood's End"" was a well written (yet short), entertaining (yet fantastic) and thought provoking (but somehow sterile) novel. I would have preferred that the storyteller focus on two or three characters as opposed to touching lightly on ten or so, but the novel stood strong based on chronicling the ascension of mankind toward a ""universal mind"" and a tempo similar to a t.v. documentary. And though the group mentality of man as presented in the novel seemed unrealistically fatalistic (and passive, considering the threat), its difficult for me to criticize the depiction. Who knows what the collective psychology of earth would reveal given the fact --not the assumption-- that we are not alone in the universe? At this point, Clarke's ""Childhood's End"" is as accurate a guess as any."
4,A New World,"Arthur. C. Clark has one of the most intriguing visions of the future. In his novel `Childhood's End' the human race is no longer alone, alien like creatures, the Overlords have come down to earth to guide this humanity. The sudden arrival of the Overlords changes the day to day life of every human being. The new way of life is for some time considered `splendid'. For many chapters Clark keeps the reader in suspense,which sometimes alters the reader's view on the rest of th e story. Nevertheless, shortly he reveals the secret side of the Overlords. After this part, the book's pace is accelerated rapidly often leaving the reader puzzled but free to interpret the scenes the way they want. Despite the ending Arthur C Clark can easily be credited for one of the most remarkable science fiction book, he has a very original way of portraying characters and their contribution towards the plot."
5,One of the best classic science-fiction books,"I remember now why I loved this book. It seems like a typical science-fiction book fromt the 50s - you know space-ships arriving from another planet, Overlords demanding that the human race live peacefully, yada, yada, yada. It could easily be another telling of the movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" However, it is much more than that. Keep reading until the end, and you'll know what I mean."
2,Just another movie!,"When I saw the trailer I was thinking that this movie will be a good movie because the sobject is very interesting, but the movie waste it!... It's not a Sci- Fi movie, it's not a drama movie, it's not a romantic movie, it is in middle of all so i you can expectations with this movi don't be so critic."
1,Another Earth - Another region,"Blue ray,DVD and Digital discs received as ordered. Big problem; I can not get them to play on my DVD player, as they are not suited for play in the UK. I did manage to use the digital copy and watch the movie on my computer. I just don't get this market segmentation and discrimination nonsense. I wanted to pay for my viewing but I can now understand why people buy pirate copies.As for the film; it sort of left me cold. Brit Marling did hold me captive for most of the duration, even though the plot failed to exploit the concept of parallel worlds sufficiently. Over all a bit indulgent but firmly focused on this earth.Perhaps if I had watched it on blue ray, or even on a large screen, my experience may have been different. I still have a still of this as my computer wallpaper."
3,"Not what I expected, but it was still OK...","The acting was excellent. The story idea was undeniably thought provoking. I'm happy to have this among my collection. I was prepared for a serious sci-fi adventure loaded with special effects, and the only special effect is the other Earth. In terms of holistic filmmaking -- they nailed it: The character development was believable; the diegesis peculiar but interesting. It's not often that a film can be measured strictly by artistic merit alone, but all of the Human elements came together seamlessly. I desperately wanted to know more about the 'other' Earth and was angry that the story did not attempt to physicalize that longing until the last 5 seconds. Scholastically, the film deserves a 5, but subjectively, I'm disappointed."
1,simply awefull,"SOME MOVIES ARE SO BAD I SIMPLY THROW THEM IN THE TRASH.....AFTER 60 MINUTES I BEGAN TO FAST FORWARD, DOUBTING A 3 STAR COULD BE THIS BAD......IT IS, BE WARNED..."
2,The anti-enjoyment science fiction movie,"Ok, for a darkly introspective, sloooow movie about a deeply miserable main character, this was ok. This is a story about a girl who kills a man's family in a car accident and spends the rest of the movie fighting her own guilt and trying to make his life better. That's it. If you know that going into it (and are still interested) it might be a good movie. But if you're expecting a movie about ""Another Earth"", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then. There are NO special effects other than ocasional shots of the other earth in the sky above ours. Calling it science fiction is a little misleading, unlike the title which is very misleading. It'd be better described as a long, drawn-out, dark episode of the Twilight Zone."
3,Learned how to play on this guitar,"This guitar is perfect for learning! Its not put together all cheap either, its a real guitar. It does tend to go out of tune pretty fast, maybe within a day, but that makes it good for learning how to tune, I was an ace at that before long. Its a good guitar for learning and has gorgeous sound for something as inexpensive as it is."
4,When Every Day Was Fourth of July/Long Days of Summer,"These are two worthwhile movies-i have a personal biasis as my mother grew up in this neighborhood in Bridgeport during the time and after and knew the families involved including the Coopers.I spent the first 3 and a half years of my life in the neighborhood at my grandfather's great 3 story house with elevator,stained glass windows and marble.I knew many of the adults and children portrayed.These two movies have fantastic historical and family values and I recommend both"
3,Fuzzy photos,This camera works reasonably well but the photos are kind of fuzzy. Also there's a big lag in the time between pressing the shutter button and when it actually takes the picture. We're already looking for something to replace it.
3,New York City ain't got nothin' at all,"This is a track by track cover album by The Queers of the classic Ramones album. The songs are even in the exact same order. The songs are played well enough, but the question is why listen to this instead of the Ramones original? The arrangements are not much different from the original versions, so not much new is added. The most notable change is a different vocal arrangement on ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker"". It's hard to say who this might appeal to."
4,Must Have,"This is a rare and unique album of the Queers covering one ofthe greatest Ramones records in it's entirety ""Rocket to Russia."" Generally excepted as the second greatest Ramones record, the Queers offer up a great rendition of this classic album which is the third installment of the series. Screeching Weasel did the Ramones first record, The Vindictives covered ""Leave Home,"" now listen to the Queers take the Rocket to Russia. A must have for any pop punk fan."
2,Rent a video of the cartoon,"This film was simply terrible. I had high hopes for it, too. Gadget never fell in love in the series, and the Gadgetmobile never talked (though that was the coolest character in the movie). Dr. Claw (or is it just Claw now) was the worst character. My favorite, though, was his pudgy little henchman, who looked EXACTLY like the one in the cartoon. I had to applaud that one."
3,Great Cast Wasted In A So-So Movie!,"I liked the Inspector Gadget cartoon so when I heard they made it into a live-action movie I went to a movie theater to see it and despite having a great cast that includes Matthew Broadrick, Michelle Trachtenberg, Joely Fisher, etc, the plot of this movie was kind of rushed and uneven and just disappointing!"
1,if I could give less than one star I would!,When I received the package there was NO movie in the case. it was just an empty case VERY UNSATISFIED
3,Okay movie,"The movie was okay, nothing great though. We rented it for our kids to watch. There was one part they had to turn there heads. Its hard to find wholesome entertainment."
5,Go Go Gadget!,"This Movie is the best dsiney movie I have ever seen. This movie is the best and well done for the good reviews. This movie is deffiently a Family movie for all ages but (parent should see it before son or daughter watch it) This movie is about Officer Brown turns in to inspecor gadget when he gets himself in to a car accident. When he is first Inspector Gadget he loses mind and forget about every thing. He has an Evial enemy I frogot his name. But he makes Inspector Gadget look bad. And at the end Inspector Gadget Finds a New girl friend. Brenda Breafford (Joley Fisher) th main chacters are Brenda, Penny, Inspector Gadget, Brain, This movie you got to see."
1,Go Go throw my money away,"After watching this movie i felt that it put to shame the original cartoon. Having too weird of effects, it seemed too fake. I felt bad taking my little cousin to see it because now he thinks that the cartoon is like this too. I thought the cartoon character could ""act"" better than Matthew Broderick. And for heaven's sake take that annoying voice from the car. Inspector Gadget is not from the freakin ghetto."
1,Go Go Gadget ripoff,"It uses every over-the-top reaction,every cartoony sound effect,every corny slapstick and every dumb joke soo much that it's not funny.It tries waay too hard to be funny to a point that it is not funny at all. It has little to do with the cartoon and the moments that are true to the show is just a slap in the face. The movie's Dr.Claw is nothing like the Craw from the cartoon. He's more like a sidekick to him. The acting is crud. The editing is trash. AND YOU THOUGHT THE LAST AIRBENDER WAS A BAD MOVIE!!!!! I give this trash a 1 out of 10."
2,Go-Go-Gadget Remake!,"I was very excited to hear that this movie was coming to theaters! I have been a fan of the cartoon show since my youth. I must say, I was disappointed in this movie.First, one of my pet peeves is deceptive trailers! A good portion of material from the trailer was either left out entirely or rushed through as a flashback or afterthought. This movie has the air about it that budgets ran dry and rather than scrap the movie altogether, it was rushed to production.Disney needs to raise the bar on their live action movies. This was as much of a disappointment as Snow Dogs. If you are going to produce a movie based on a book, comic book, television show, etc., from a by-gone era, it would help if a fan of the material was involved in the production in my opinion.See this one once, but save your money on the video. Maybe they will release the old cartoon on DVD. I would buy the whole series!"
3,Inspector Gadget,"The sound does not work for the first 5 minutes of the film!!! I was considering sending it back or selling it on Amazon to getmy money back, but the rest of the film is in pretty good shape!"
1,Inspector Stupid,"This movie sucked and wasn't even remotely funny. Matthew Broderick is one of the worse actors out there and made this movie even worse. Stupid plot, stupid comics, stupid stupid stupid. And I used to like to watch the old cartoon series too. If you want a stupid movie thats actually funny, go watch Meet the Deedles."
4,What a good book,"What a good, well written and thoughtful book from a boxer. He captures a great deal of his times as well as of his professional career."
5,BE-BRATZ DOLL,"MY GRAND DAUGHTERS ARE STILL ENJOYING THIS DOLL, THEY CALL THIS DOLL COOLI HAVE BOUGHT TWO OF THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR MY THIRDGRAND DAUGHTER IF SHE COULD USE THE COMPUTER."
4,The way that modern Blues/Jazz /Rock should sound...,"I was fortunate to hear this CD when it first came out, and LOVED it from the first! Warren recorded this approximately 14 mos. before the first rumblings of Gov't Mule were heard, and anyone who has any sense of musical appreciation could tell that he was going to be one of the underappreciated talents in Music today. The CD was released without much fanfare, but grew in poprlarity throughout the ranks of the Allman Brothers Band faithful quickly, and still remains one of my favorites to this day. The blend of Warren's tough, bluesy voice and the solid aggresive slide playing; coupled with the great musicianship of his backups created one of the best fusion recordings I've ever heard..I was lucky enough to see Warren perform the music live, and was just blown away! If you like great slide guitar, with a funky/bluesy twist, you will like this CD. Check it out.... I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
5,Great Solo CD From Allmans/Mule Guitarist/Vocalist/Songwriter,"TALES OF ORDINARY MADNESS is a great CD by Warren Haynes, even if it doesn't quite measure up to his work with the Allman Brothers Band and Government Mule. Even though some songs drag a bit, the majority are strong, solid blues-rock with heavy soul and funk influences. The CD has a feel similar to the Band, Delaney & Bonnie, and Joe Cocker's MAD DOGS AND ENGLISHMEN. Haynes' advocacies of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, make this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
5,"Great for delicates, light fragrance","I've used a number of products for hand- or machine-washing lingerie, including ""Forever New,"" Woolite, and others. This washing powder is my hands-down favorite. It dissolves completely even in cool water, doesn't lead to greying of whites (like Woolite can), and has the most wonderful, light fragrance. I usually prefer unscented products, but there's just enough fragrance lingering on my lingerie that it's a pleasure just to open the drawer.I also use this powder to wash cashmere on the delicate cycle (in a lingerie bag to prevent stretching). Great results there, too!"
1,Chunky Salsa,"Whew! These things shred my face to pieces! Small price, but still a waste of my mula. :-("
2,"This blade disagrees with my skin in a big, bad way.","I inserted some Wilkinson Swords in to my usual sampler pack rotation. One blade in each of my five most used razors for five days. Each of the five razors produced the same results with my usual technique: Razor burn, butchered face, and general redness and irritation. I removed the blades from my rotation as soon as the five day trial was up. I will not be using these again. As is with all shave products, though, your experience may vary. I have very sensitive, dry skin. Astras and Derby's work best for me. This probably isn't a bad product, just not the right one for me."
4,Love this,You can't find this in stores anymore. I would have given it 5 stars but the price was expensive. The product is worth 5 stars tho.
3,Good Product with Reservations.,"A little daunting to master, but once you find the right place to hold it it works well. I think my silicon tipped tongs work just as well, but it's a nice tool for your wok arsenal. Doesn't handle larger chucks of protein, but shellfish and strips of meat and poultry do just fine."
3,Another Greatest Hits Album ?,"Yes,it is another Greatest hits album from Jerry's old record label trying to still cash in on there former artist.The only reason I bought this album is because of the Bonus DVD.It has 8 music videos of Jerry's first albums.So if your a hard core fan of jerry's and have been waiting to get his videos on DVD, this ones for you.Other than that Its the same song's as his former Greatest hits album."
4,Fantastic Season,"Just an awesome season of Angel. Things hadn't gotten too overly weird yet, and the addition of Fred to the regular cast was perfect. The growing relationship between Angel and Cordelia was awesome. The only problem that I had with this season was the way they handled Conner. I came away from this season loathing the angsty kid and wishing his mother had never staked herself."
5,angel,"The product was delivered in great time and the product was perfect for my daughter's birthday present. The source of the advertisement was clear and precise. Now my daughter informs me she would like the Buffy episodes, so I will need to slowly over time get this series."
4,Perfect acoutic-based pop for those closet Duncan Sheik fans!,"If you were a fan of Duncan Sheik tunes like ""Barely Breathing,"" then AM's splendid debut (produced by Sheik's team) will be right up your alley. AM's acoustic-based pop is right up there with that great Sheik single from the early '90s, but there's much more to this music than one-hit-wonder infamy. Check out his beleagued blues on the lovely ballad ""Running Away"" or his uptempo positivity on tracks like the Weezer-esque ""City Syndrome"" and his first single, the infectious ""Mainstay."" Tunes like ""Troubled Times"" show his softer side, but it's AM's uncanny ability for writing perfect acoustic-pop hooks and his soothing voice that really sell this wonderful debut record. Many of you haven't heard of him yet, but if he keep churning out tunes like these, then trust me: You will."
4,Bought as a gag gift,"I bought this for the amusing cover. The insides are a collection of Jeff Foxworthy's redneck jokes. The cover is the funniest part, in my opinion."
4,nicely made,I like the grill cover. It is quality made. the only one drawback I don't like about it is the tie strings where they are located. they should be more on the side in the middle.
2,not a favorite,"It's been a while since I used this DVD. I purchased two others at the same time, and this one has just collected dust. If I recall, I did not find it to be ""low impact"" friendly."
3,Good in theory...,"I had trouble getting into this DVD. I liked the idea, pre-set workouts for your body type, but I guess I didn't realize that it was a weekly schedule, with you doing one workout each day. I have a hard time believing someone serious about getting in shape is going to waste their daily workout on a 7 minute upper body routine.I scrapped the idea of following the schedule and just customized my own workout. I still had difficulty with the routine. Each time a new segment begins, there's a little intro, Jessica introduces herself and the girls... I don't like that. I want to keep moving, not break for an intro every 10 minutes.Overall, I enjoyed the workout itself, but I wish the segments flowed together better...."
2,An excellent book of a bygone era...(10 years ago it would be 5 stars ),"As Jean Dragesco says in the final conclusion in this book: ""This book is quite probably the last to be devoted to high resolution obtained by the methods of photography"". Oriented exclusively on film high resolution solar, lunar and planetary photography it's competely outdated. The info on seeing conditions, types of telescopes etc is excellent and still usefull though. The era of film planetary photography has passed... TP 2415 (the best film for planetary photography) has been out of production for years... from the film developers mentioned in the book Agfa Rodinal can't be found anymore, as Agfa has gone out of business. If you are interested to see how the old timers could achieve really impressive planetary photographs on film this book may be of interest to you, but the price of 75$ seems too high, if you want to take real high resolution images yourself by modern means (I don't use the word photographs)look elsewhere."
4,"Nice, but quiet","I bought this CD about a year and a half ago and play it all the time, but I do have to turn up the volume, especially in the car (which is a lousy place to listen to serious music anyway). I still prefer Bonney's ""Deh vieni"" to the other recordings I have, including Bartoli and Upshaw. I love the ""Sull'aria,"" something omitted from a Nozze Highlights CD (also featuring Bonney) I also own. If you like Bonney, you'll probably love the recording."
2,Squeeze too much stuff on a DVD and the picture degrades,"This DVD taught me that if you squeeze too much stuff on a dvd, the picture degrades. All three of the movies on this DVD have terrible resolution, which diminishes any opportunity for enjoyment. The resolution competes with the silly plots and terrible acting so I don't know what's worse."
3,"i knew going in that this would be a cheese fest,so i found that i liked it somewhat","ok sure the transfers aren't very good,the movies aren't very good,and wellat least the price is right. i knew that this disc(yep,all three movies on one,one sided disc) wouldn't be very good,and the fact that i had only heard of one of the movies clued me in to the fact that i had grade a cheese in my hand. the point i guess is that i expected very little and so was happy with what i got. if you are looking for grade a movies and transfers quit buying these cheap sets,you know that they aren't going to be that great and to expect it to be great is really not very smart on your part. relax,unwind,and just sit back and watch,if you drop all the beefs about them you might enjoy these movies because some are so bad as to be funny."
3,An inside look at Kasparov,"This is not a great book, but it is a good book. Waitzkin gets to spend time with Kasparov before and during his last (5th) match with Karpov. There is a little biographical background about Kasparov scattered through the book. Most of the book concerns the time of the championship match. There is also a chapter on the Linares tournament that followed.Some things I found interesting about the book: (1) the behind-the-scenes view of Kasparov's preparation for the match. (2) the political turmoil in the Soviet Union. Kasparov was working to end communism. (3) the descriptions of the games without moves and diagrams. (4) amusing anecdotes about the chess world. (5) a little bit of an update on Josh Waitzkin.Warning: There are no game scores or analysis in this book. It is all talk. That was fine with me._Searching for Bobby Fischer_ was a much more interesting book to me. I recommend you read that one. If you love _Searching for Bobby Fischer_, you will like _Mortal Games_."
4,"A basic, yet fun set","From the viewpoint of a Lego collector, this is a very basic set, and quite small in size. From a child's perspective, I'm sure entire worlds are just waiting to be explorered here though. =)It has nice features, including a ""mirror"" that shows Potter both with and without the Sorceror's stone in his hands, just like in the novels (this is a sticker that changes between the views depending on the angle of which you look at it). The Quirrel figure is very nice - featuring Voldemort's face on his backside (very authentic feature, and quite nice).As a cost-to-features rating, though, I felt the set was just slightly overpriced due to it's limited scope and size."
2,Boring,"For a novice person this video might be ok. I had never done pilates before this tape and I did not find it challenging enough after I did the workouts a few times. I got bored watching a single person on the screen with someone else describing the exercise in the background, no music. There are a lot of workouts to choose from. I did like the fact that there were workouts for times when you don't have a lot of time to spend working out or you can workout for a long period. I did not like the way the video was set up, the segments did not flow together. In between each segment the screen would fade to black and the single woman would reappear and the annoying voice would start again. Overall I thought the video was boring and I had a hard time wanting to complete a workout."
2,Uninspiring,"When someone makes a video, I look for inspiration, passion, and dedication. This video appears nearly clinical with correctness, but I did not think the model expressed vitality or muscularity. Another point is that the verbal instruction did not feel inpiring. Am I the only one, or did anyone else think it's impossible to put 35 workouts on one DVD? There are a lot of DVDs on Pilates. I suggest checking out some of the others."
1,BORING,"i practically fell asleep while watching this tape, the girl doing the exercises isn't even saying anything while she's doing it. It's a voice over! also she's all alone in a blank room. All the exercises are basically the same. I would suggest Mtv Pilates. It's a lot more fun!"
4,Try it everyday for 2 weeks,"I've never tried Pilates before but I excercise regularly. With bikini weather here I decided to try this DVD because of what I'd heard that it does for your abs. It's true, the 'workouts' on the DVD are usually only 7-12 minutes long despite what the menu options say, but I've found that doing atleast 4 'workouts' a day has made a huge difference in the way my abs look. What's great about this DVD is the number of 'workouts' included for each level of training. I've been using it for a month and I'm only yet beginning the intermediate level. I can see that I'll be using this DVD for quite a while."
5,Great Overall Fitness DVD,"Overall a pretty good fitness DVD with lots of variety. I was impressed with the simple interactive menus, cause I am completely techno ""dummy"". The disc comes with just about every available time imaginable. I had heard about how Pilates makes you stronger and create a longer svelte type muscles, not those bulky overbearing masculine looking muscles. After 8 weeks my abs look and feel incredible. My girlfriend bought the DVD herself and found out highly beneficial."
3,not exactly what the title promised-but still good,"I do have all the dvd features on my player, but there is still in no way 35 complete workouts. The routines do run in loops. The moves are carefully demonstrated-the beginner modifications are doable and safe. Not to personally attack the announcer but it's very annoying to hear her pant and count out the reps of the hundred, and since each routine includes that it's a lot of panting. I recommend pilates for dummies or ana cabans videos over this."
3,Not what I had hoped for...,"I find that while this DVD offers many workout scenarios for different levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced), it does not particularly offer beginners much as far as detailed explanations of the movements is concerned. I also find the ""voice over"" format a little impersonal and annoying. I think this is a great DVD for those who may have been exposed to Pilates through either taking a mat class or having some other previous experience, but feel that a better DVD for ""raw"" beginners is ""Pilates for Dummies"" with Michelle Dozois. Much more detailed explanation for beginners. Also I highly recommend the book ""Pilates - Body in Motion"" by Alycea Ungaro...this combined with the ""Pilates for Dummies"" DVD is a great way for a beginner to get the basics down and to progress further along as well. But this is strictly my opinion."
5,Not a Halo controller,"This is an awesome item, great range, no lag. But this is a normal green attack controller, just like Logitech always used to sell new for less than the Precision controller. Don't give in to the idiots selling this item just because it's green, go to Logitech's website and pick it up for half the price."
5,Missing no one except Katia Skanavi,"I was pleased after reading the list of performers to see that Gould's machine-gun jiffy-pop piano ""playing"" is not included. I would like to hear more of Skanavi tho."
5,All Good,"I happily join the general consensus. This is a unfortunately obscure group and overlooked album once relegated to the 99c bin in times past, at least it is not out of print at present. Hard rocking, sort of like Stone Temple Pilots but ultimately very hard to classify, genre-crossing, with a dose of Glam Rock. Even Shoegazer fans will be pleased."
1,"If I could offer less stars, i would.","The information found in this book can easily be found elsewhere throughout the internet. I was very displeased with the quality of the book itself, minimum amount of recipes (seemed like there was only 1 or 2 recipes with 20 different variations), and lack of nutritionals associated with each recipe."
3,Interesting.,"It's interesting but it's not earth-shattering. I've had mixed results with the flavors, I'm not big into the artificial sweetener aftertaste and unfortunately had that with every batch. Some good ideas though! I guess it was just written before so many newer sweetening products were available."
2,Home Made,This movie was not good at all. The camera work looks like it was made with a sharp viewcam. The acting is garbage and the plot is empty. You can even see the cameraman's shadow in some scenes. All the people do in this movie is talk smack about how they run things. It is truly wack! I bet you I can make a better movie than this with my own camera and my friends as actors!
3,very good camera work from the cinematographer George Cotayo,"The story had no sense, acting is very poor, it shows that the producers/director didn't know how to make a movie but the cameraman's work is very good. ok to rent but not to buy."
2,Poor picture quality,"I am an avid collector of classic movies, and the quality on this DVD is very poor. Not like I rememered"
3,Good Antec fan but there are better options.,"It should be noted that the currently shipping of these fans is the clear type (not black as pictured above in listing). The same fan is available from here with a three speed control which this one lacks. Antec recommends in the manual, a ""low"" setting for the add-on fan for the 902 case...this fan will only run on high. I wound up buying the TriCool Blue after receiving this one. Next time I'll read a little closer on the item descriptions."
2,color is off crom most antec fans,it has decent cfm i would say about 75 to 90-cfm at about 25 to 28db but if you own a antec 900 or antec 1200 it is more like a light blue and dont match colors of the antec cases other then that it has decent air flow
3,Have these movies been remastered?,Can somebody out there please tell me if these movies were remastered? I would only buy this set if the picure quality has been improved.
1,NO Remote!!!,"I ordered this card from Amazon and did not receive the power pack edition as advertized, but instead the standard edition without the remote. I returned it and promptly received a replacement from Amazon, but it was again the standard edition. I will give them one more chance to get it right. If not, then this is a classic case of bait and switch."
2,much less compared to PX 100W,"I purchased it based on my extreme satisfaction with the sound quality of the PX 100. A higher number means a better product, right? Wrong. The sound has virtually no bass compared to PX100 and overall sound is tinny. I immediately returned it & ordered a second PX100. The only thing going for the PX 200W is the same smart fold design & accompanying case that comes with a PX100."
3,Come on...,An ok book but nothing worth cooking a feast over. It smells a bit of justing being there to bring home some $$.
5,Excellent and Inspiring,"There are various articles and booklets about the talented writer, singer, and song writer, Jewel Kilcher. CHASING DOWN THE DAWN is different because it consists of full color snap shots of her life from her perspective. Stories from her childhood in Alaska all the way to her shows right before the book was published are presented in a hypnotic, poetic prose. It is almost as if she is sitting in a chair telling her story to a good friend, who happens to be you. Everything from growing up in Alaska to surviving constant tours, her mother and father, people that left impressions along the road of life... The story is very inspiring, and I highly recommend it to any Jewel Kilcher fan."
3,Money Making Secrets of Internet Auctions,Very limited basic information. Much of it seems dated already. I cannot imagine any serious eBay seller learning from this. I have been using eBay for auctions for 2 week and could add a lot of information based on my brief experiences.
5,Great for a beginner - LOVE IT!,"This is perfect for me! My previous workout routine was come home, cook, sit down and do nothing. By the blessing of Weight Watchers I only need to lose a couple pounds but really need to tone and this is really working for me. It is easy to follow and the instructor is great - not cheesy at all. The exercises are simple and she explains them well. An advanced person might not be so in to it. The pre made workouts (like for a strapless dress!) are great especially if you don't know where to start. It tells you which work outs to do everyday. Beginner Brides this is a must have! I'll probably still use it after my wedding!"
3,"Good workout, gets boring after a while.","I bought this DVD after using SELF video's, and was a bit discouraged to see that:1. I have to waste time choosing different segments2. The strip tease at the end is cheesy.Other than that, the video wasn't bad. I just didn't feel that there was enough intensity in this video and a lot of moves were shown for a short period of time. The music was enjoyable, and the instructor was easy to follow but this video would have been better if there was no start-stop-start segments. After a few times of using this video, I put it down and haven't picked it up since."
2,ehh,"I couldn't really get into this one. I didn't find the moves to be very challenging or innovative. It would probably be a good gift for someone new to working out. It is definitely full of 'pre-wedding' verbiage, which I found kind of annoying."
3,No Instructions on XMas day,"My daughter wanted this magic kit more than anything. When she opened it up her eyes lit up -- just what the holiday should bring. But, there were no instructions in the kit. We couldn't do any of the tricks. We sent a note to M&D; asking for instructions -- hopefully they will come soon.Pros: very solid, lots of tricks, good price.Cons: no instructions"
3,It COULD Be Fun...If It Were a Little Easier to Figure Out!,"I bought this set for my 7 year old for Christmas. He really does like it, but we still haven't figured out how to do all of the tricks! The instructions a vague, at best, with little to no illustrations (which you really do need!).Every so often he'll come downstairs to show me a new trick as he figures them out. I gave up trying after a half hour of the ""invisible box.""I'm sure someone here has them all figured out...perhaps you could post some videos and show the rest of us?Finally, don't let my review deter you from your purchase. This is a really well-built set for a decent price. If you are more talented in the magic department than I, you and your child will love it."
5,wow magic did i buy that?,"i don't remember buying that..... but if i did..... I was probably drinking ""Dos Equis"".-the most interesting man alive"
4,For a 6 year old boy,"Was given to a 6 year old boy. I knew he would need supervision and help with the tricks, but he still loved the set. He wanted to put on a magic show right away. I wanted to get a non-fighting toy and I think this was a good option. It is very durable for a child's magic set."
2,Magic Kit,The magic kit arrived broken. It was not obvious and unfortunately it was a gift and I was unable to return it. The wood was thin and I can see why it would break in the shipping process but it was very disappointing. Some of the tricks worked and that part was fun but it hasn't been played with much since the Birthday party.
2,not a smart purchase,This game is okay but nothing special. I would not recommend buying it. It is too basic and not worth the money.
1,Buying another replacement (again),"Here I go buying my 6th replacement part for my X10 system in 4 years. I use this stuff maybe a dozen times a year to power various pool accessories, ie. my pool waterfall pump and my spa light. My pool installers didn't include hand switches for these items, only the X10 setup, hence the continual part replacements. Next time one of these fails I will rip it all out and just install hand switches. Overall, these are good when they work, but they burn out regularly and are expensive to replace."
4,Blue Cheer - 'Beast Is Back: The Megaforce Years' (Megaforce),"Never even knew about this CD,until here recently. A 1985 reunion between two original Blue Cheer members, bassist / vocalist Dickie Peterson and drummer Paul Whaley. They had guitarist Tony Rainier play on this one album. I was a bit caught off guard. I mean,this CD is better than what I expected. Title has several reworkings of older tunes, like ""Summertime Blues"" and ""Out Of Focus"", but also good newly penned tracks like the rocker ""Ride With Me"", ""Girl Next Door"" and ""Heart Of The City"". So even though 'Beast Is Back...' is half new, half old material, it's still a worthy pick. Good revived late '60's heavy rock. Check it out."
1,Unconsionably poor handling of order,"I purchased a GoPhone and refill card by email. I subsequently received email advising delay because phones were out of stock. I then received email advising that order had been shipped. I received a box by usps, containing packing materials and a phone CARD ONLY. I called and was subjected to about two hours ofnonsensical answers, mainly insisting that I had only ordered the refill card. I have copies of all these emails. Finally, I received a letter advising that the $49.99 charge would be removed from my credit card. Have since bought cell phone from other provider. Sorry, I could not focus on the product because you failed to ship the product. It was a positive experience after all because it taught me never use AMAZON again. Hope this was helpful, however, so long as you hire idiotic people you will only be able to provide inept service."
4,X10 LM465 Lamp Control Module,Smarthome.com makes same thing but theirs has dimming capabilities with memory. They need to make them dim off and on too. Still works great and I could not live without my x10 products.
1,Disapointed,"Came in time, used but looked new, but didn't function..I don't know why, such a simple device?To cheap to return.."
2,"Great idea, but needs work.","I played this game recently, and at first, it made a ""cute"" impression. The graphics, although slightly fuzzy, were nice and gave a good, retro-space look from the 50s. The music was also pretty tight, as was the dancing, if not ridicously funny. But the main problem with this game was it's control. Response was awful, and the supposed tutorial was just a version of the manual plastered on your TV screen.After figuring out the controls though, I got a general hang of it, but not 10 minutes into the game, you hit some incrediablly complex combinations that are just way too much. One major problem is that the voice acting of the aliens is terrible. Granted, they ARE aliens, but they weren't real good at pronouncing the words clearly enough to be understood, so you knew which way to press.All in all, I don't recommend this game. With shaky control and bad directions, it's a good idea, but flawed. Looks like just a screwed-up import if you ask me."
5,A range of emotions,"This is a book that makes your emotions run the full range from one extreme to the next. The Author really makes you feel what it is like to be in this women's skin. Once you get sucked into the main character's (Gamsi) life, it is hard to put this book down."
1,Barbie Goes to Hogwarts,"My 9 y.o. son got this set for Christmas, along with several others. His first reaction was ""there's a lot of pink!"" This set (along with the Diagon Alley and Hogwart's classroom sets, which share the garish color scheme) seems to be a shameless pandering to little girls, but somehow I don't think even the most diehard Barbie girls envision Ron Weasley's room done up in pink, tangerine, and turquoise....The other sets in this series, with the more appropriate grey color scheme, are wonderful and my son is having a great time with them. This one will probably be given away as he's embarrassed to have it. My advice: don't buy this one unless a child has seen it and asked for it!"
5,Classic Shirley Jones and Florence Henderson,"This disc was a joy from start to finish. Most of the Bell Telephone Hour stagings I have seen are corny, but the musical performances on this DVD are very impressive. Shirley Jones' singing is very nuanced and intimate. She seems to be having a great time. Watch how seductive she is in ""I've Got a Crush On You."" Florence Henderson is equally wonderful. You can tell how much fun she was having, and how much fun it must have been for the live audience. It's amazing how many songs are on the program, even though it is only 66 minutes. I wish there was more!"
3,Excellent Mozart; Disappointing Beethoven,"I absolutely loved the Mozart, and I think Pollini should record more of him, but I bought this mainly for the Beethoven ""Emperor"" Concerto. His edition with Claudio Abbado is out of print, it seems, and this was(a reissue of) the only other recording he's made of the Beethoven Concerto that I am aware of.The piano is UNFORGIVABLY LOUD in the Beethoven. The performance is exactly what I wanted(even better than the legendary Fleisher cycle on Sony Classical), otherwise, but the piano is so loud in parts that one cannot hear what the orchestra's doing.I am a huge fan of Pollini, and few can approach his mastery of all things Beethoven, but I just want to violently SHAKE the person that ruined this recording by mixing the piano in so loudly."
3,Could be better.,"These styli fit my old Palm Tungsten E2 and my newer T/X. I bought them because I thought I had lost my stylus to the Tungsten.The styli are noticeably lighter in weight than the original stylus. The pin is not useful for the T/X, because the stylus works just as well for resetting. It did help reset the E2, but I actually don't like having the pin, because the tip of the stylus needs to come off to use it and that tip keeps unscrewing.The pen is a nice feature and it works. I think that is its best selling point. Nice to have a pen with me when I need it.Overall, I would like a stylus with more weight and I'd prefer it if the tip didn't keep unscrewing on me."
3,Good but not reliable,"I have gotten this product twice, which should say something about its reliability. The idea of a stylus/pen combo that fits my E2 is terrific, and when I am out and about, it comes in handy. But at home and in the office, I have a stylus from an old style palm that I use. These are the reasons why:1. The screw-off tip of the stylus end comes loose always. Its rattling makes the whole device feel unstable.2. The pen works pretty well, but after using it several times, the ""cap"" tends to get loose, and I have lost more than one.3. And this is the biggest complaint I have: the rubber tip of the stylus pops off, usually without my knowledge, so I can't find it to put it back on. This makes that end of the device worthless, and I have to replace the whole stick. This is probably why they come in packages of 3, but it would be nice for it to last a lot longer than it does."
2,The Reluctant Tuscan,"Having read several thoroughly enjoyable books on the south of France, I thought this one on Tuscany would be similar and would tempt me to read more about that region. Well this didn't happen, I found it shallow and very light. I learnt nothing about Tuscany or the way of life there, it lacked pizzazz, and I found it hard to finish. I kept on wondering when will something happen, I'm still waiting. I expected something along the lines of Peter Mayle whose writing is rich and amusing as well as witty and informative, but I was sadly disappointed. Not one I would recommend."
4,DELIGHTFUL!,"Definately entertaining; a light hearted recitation of the trials and tribulations of ""going native"" in beautiful Tuscany. How the author struggled to change his life style from the intensity and stressful rythm of Los Angeles artistic industry to the relaxed approach to living in an Italian village (though not without incident)."
2,Not worth the wait . . .,I have been a big fan of The Association for a long time but have never had the chance to see them in concert. I was looking forward to this DVD for that reason. This was a poorly shot and recorded concert. For a group that has so much to offer especially with their unique vocals it looked and sounded as if it was recorded by my 13 year old son using an old camcorder. Hopefully they will release something in the future that has a greater production value as well as decent sound quality.
3,"Great Reference, but Cryptic Directions and Needs better Maps and Pictures","I received this book from a friend that knew I liked to hike. It is a great reference and I have learned about a lot of trails I never knew about (hence the 3 stars). However, the directions to the trail-heads are very cryptic and if you don't know the area very well you are out of luck. Also there are not any color pictures which would be helpful to decide whether you want to take a certain trail. My advice is to keep looking for a good hiking trail reference for Northern California."
5,Excellently priced and very comfortable,The price and dimensions were why we bought this but it came fast and was a great solution the moment it sprang out of the pack!
1,An awful baseball game - No fielding!,"I dont understand all the 5 stars for this game. This game was hyped up to be the best and it is really lacking as my review and most of the views by game sites on the web state. First of all, the graphics are good but not great. There is edgy crowd graphics and skippy fluidity of movement around the bases sometimes. Now for the real killer...gameplay. I can't recall one baseball game that doesnt have an option for you to field except for Microleague Baseball back in the late 80's. Thing about that game was that you are the manager, solely...so I can understand this. In this game where it is a new hi tech baseball game to not have an option where the player can move players to field the ball is absurd. I STRONGLY recommend not to waste money on this game if you can't stand playing a baseball game that is as far as real as baseball is."
1,"be patient, dont buy this game","man oh man...this is one of the worst buys ive ever bought for a system...i couldn't wait for a baseball game for the DC and really wanted to love this game...but its just so awful. i dont usually review things online, but i really felt cheated. sega should be ashamed."
1,Big Disappointment,"Please refer to the review of WSB2K1 game ... before you purchase this game. I didn't. This game lacks many promised features (i.e. homerun derby, batting pratice, pitch selection via VMU, color commentary). Also game play itself is poor. The computer controls all fielding. The game is primarily hitting and pitching. The announcer reminds me of the old Sega Genesis Sports Talk games - choppy, repeatative, and meaningless."
2,World Series Baseball 1990,"In two words, ten years late. the graphics are edgy and the rosters aren't correct. They have Bonds on the Expos, and Griffey on the White sox! The control is alright, but the graphics take away from that. Don't buy it, and save your money for someting worth the money, like Bases Loaded 2 for NES"
5,This Game Is great!,The graphics are so real! The players have their actual stats! It also is a great pitching!
1,Stay Away,I love baseball games and this game is just bad -- How can you have a game where you don't even get to field? What was Sega thinking? Graphics a great but that does not make up for all the problems in game play. It is almost impossible to pitch anything but a strike right down the middle of the plate. Hitting isn't that bad rather interesting but very hard to get the hang of. My suggestion wait till ESPN Baseball come out is has to be better.
1,Worst game ever!!!!!,"This is simply a horrible game that makes you want your money back!!!!!! The computer controls your fielding until the ball is caught. Most of the time your man doesnt even move until the ball hits the ground. It made me so mad I almost took the CD out and set fire to it. Im pretty tolerable of game glitches, but this is pure crap."
4,"Give it a chance, willya?","... For the record: -- Pitching is hard, but fully controllable and pinpoint-accurate once you get the hang of it.-- Batting is very hard (just like in real life) but with a lot of practice you can get pretty good. I've got several players, including ""me,"" with .500+ averages after 10-20 season games.-- While the fielders can be frustrating and stupid, the system works pretty well for me. It's all about timing. Though you can't control them much, you do have control over where they throw the ball and how fast they get it there.-- Base-running is also glitchy, but not a deal-killer.-- The announcer? Okay, he's annoying as hell.Bottom line: rent it and give it a fair shake. You just might like it."
1,The game is horrible!,I bought this game after waiting for it for months. You cannot field on the game (the computer fields for you) and there is no home run derby (which sega promised). This game lacks in so many different ares. Go buy All Star Baseball 2001 for N64 instead.
1,This Game B[ad]!,"This Game [bad]! Sure the graphics are phenominal. But, if you cant field, aim you pitches easily, bat easily, or do things fast, then whats the point. Don't buy this!"
2,Baseball 2K1 Disappoints,"Since this is the ONLY baseball game available for Dreamcast and we had to wait until August to get it, I am amazed at the disparity between the best features and stuff missing in the game. While the graphics can be truely spectacular (they got Nomar's batting routine down quite well) and what got the 2nd star, there are action features that have been on other platforms for years, such as fielding, that are missing. My kids old version of Backyard Baseball on a 486 PC doesn't stall as much as the Dreamcast does with this game. The ability to take an extra base, throw out a runner trying to steal and getting the pitch where you want it seem always to be subject to chance when playing with multiple players. On the whole, I wish we had bought a PlayStation last Christmas (they have competing products in this market segment!)."
3,Pretty Enjoyable,"World series Baseball 2K1 is a half-way decent game. It has its ups and downs. For hardcore baseball fans like me, it is a very enjoyable game. This game has superb graphics, many players look fairly close to what they look like in real life. The computer (with artificial intelligence) provides some competition for beginning players, but as you get more experienced, you may find yourself beating the other team 25 to 2. It is cool to see your players have amazing stats, though. You, however, have no control over fielding whatsoever. Some plays are made correctly while others become jawdroppers. You can player multiplayer in the exhibition mode, but not the season mode. This game definitely needs improvement, but it can satisfy some players."
2,Horrible game great graphics,"This game has great graphics,dont get me wrong. The gameplay is horrible and stupid. My advice dont play it."
5,Makes you keep wanting more!,"I am pretty new to the world of graphic novels and comic books. My favorite super hero has always been Spider-man but just recently I started actually reading the comics. This is one of the first ones I read, and I've got to say that it is excellent! It is pretty easy to follow as long as you know at least a little bit about Spider-Man, and the main villain in this book is incredible! He is very sinister and just seems completely unbeatable. It makes you keep wanting to read to see how Spider-Man wins (because let's face it, he has to win, he's the hero). From start to finish, this book had my interest and I hope you enjoy it."
5,Wow!,"This is the story line that got me excited about comics again. I loved the fact that Peter finally grows up while J. Michael Straczynski writes the story. He added so much more color and depth to the character. I've always been a fan of Spider-Man but was always upset that he was such a static character. He never progressed, he never matured, he was a perpetual teen-ager, until this series. I was extremely upset when they 'reset' the character after Michael but I thought I would give it a chance. Well, I'm still upset and I can't stand the 'new' Spidey. Michael's vision is the new cornerstone of my Spider-Man collection and until further notice, I'm not buying more. Get this series. You will love it."
4,I use it constantly---,"I examined both this book and another similar work at my local bookstore and found this to be superior. For me, the best feature is its detailed index of nearly every hamlet, village, town and city in Great Britain and Ireland. My only criticism is that counties are not included as part of the identification in the index, e.g. I would have preferred, Windsor, Berkshire and not merely Windsor."
5,Great Book,"I didn't want the book to end. Like his previous book, Divided Roads, Mansour has written a book that is both entertaining and thought provoking. It was fun and interesting to follow the five main characters and observe how their relationships develop and change as they experience a variety of challenging and life changing events. I highly recommend this book."
4,Great for art/ design students,Got this printer for my graphic design school needs because sometimes you just need to go bigger than 8.5 x 11 at home. The print quality is not professional but good enough for your everyday poster and photo projects and you even have border-less printing. Ink is a bit much but buy in bulk and this printer is a good buy.
2,FORGET USED PRODUCTS THAT SAY LIKE NEW!!,MY BOYFRIEND NEEDED THIS PRINTER TO REPLACE HIS OLD ONE BECASUE HE IS NOT READY TO GOVE UP HIS COMPUTER. HE IS A PHOTOGRAPHER. UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN NOT FIND A BRAND NEW PRINTER 1280. SO HE BOUGHT THIS ONE. SAID LIKE NEW.. WORSE THAN HIS OLD ONE. NOW HE WILL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER COMPUTER AND PRINTER ANYWAY.. NEVER BUY A REFURBISHES OR LIKE NEW!!! IT IS A WASTE OF TIME.........
2,"buy the 2200, you will save with ink costs","I bought this printer 2.5 years ago and wish that I bought the 2200 at that time. As a graphic design student, I print a lot with this printer and find myself using $60-100 a week of ink that I buy at a discounted price. My classmates that have the 2200 report that they typically spend about $20 to $30 a week on ink (as they come with separate cartridges for each color), their print quality is better, and the 2200 seems to break down less. My printer is now broken and not under warranty and the repairs cost me $167.00. Most of the people that I know that have the 1280 have had to repair or replace it within the last 2 years. If you expect to be printing a lot, my advice is to spend the extra cash on the 2200 and you will make it back with the savings on the ink. Another piece of advice is to buy it at costco. If I bought it there 2 years ago, I could get a brand new one today, no questions asked."
1,I'll not buy EPSON again,"EPSON has taken selling consumables to the max with this printer. No matter how much time you spend and how carefully you set up your print, the 1280 will find a way to trash it. Print borderless and it will crop the heads off your subjects. Spend too much time to set up the print and the nozzles are clogged. Then if you're not out of ink or paper, and you can get it to load without scrapping the paper, get ready to calibrate your project all over again because this printer can't place a print in the same spot twice."
4,Excellent photo quality prints,"This printer prints out amazing true color prints that are sharp and photo quality. It however take me some time to get to this point. If you are serious about making color prints invest in good monitor calibration software without it you're going to be at the whims of an uncalibrated monitor which makes it virtually impossible to match with the output. (I bought Spyder2 for $150). The printer does take some maintenance, including either regular printing or head cleaning. The prints are not cheap. Using premium Epson paper and inks, results in beautiful prints, but if you're planning on knocking off some 4X6 family photos, I would not recommend this printer. I use the printer mainly for 11 X 17 and 13 X 19 enlargements."
3,Good & Bad,"No reliability issues yet. I've had this printer about a year. I wanted prints that last a awhile longer, prints that look great, and <gosh> I didn't want a whole lot of trouble or expense to accomplish this.PLUS+++ Produces the best looking prints when its working properly & all the set up is in order.Bad--- Gulps ink.--- It is not unusual for me to go 30 days without needing to print photos. As a result I have to clean prints heads, align, etc. (uses ink and paper for the tweaking, ie more waste) before using. I guess the ink clogs in the nozzles. On one occasion I used half the ink ($$) in the color cartridges before the printer was ready to produce decent quality prints. I can't recommend this printer for anyone unless they do a lot photo printing on a regular basis."
4,Great Game,I thought totally Angelica is a REALLY fun game it is Challgeing but it's more for 7 and up crowds I never beat it I'm stuck on the last level which is a fantasy world but its still fun
1,Review from a parent!,"My daughter is 6 and enjoyed playing this game, however, anytime she wanted to turn it off we had to write down the lengthy code and then type it back in when she wanted to get back to her last level. This is a definate problem for parents because the code contains hyroglyphics, numerals and letters...trust me, it would sometimes take me 5 minutes to input the code. Also, you have to keep a new code everytime she gets new points and the code changes completely. Much wasted time for the parent and child!!!!"
3,Not age appropriate,"I feel this game is a little complex for young children. I do not feel that ""Cynhia's Shuffle Puzzle"" a mini-game is appropriate for children. The children get frustrated and don't want to play the game."
5,This does TOO work with the Canon Selphy ES30 printer!,"I dont know why Amazon says this catridge is not compatible with the Canon Selphy ES30, but I'm here to tell you it most certainly is. I almost passed on it until I googled for more info. It DOES work, if you dont want to spend the money for the 100 pack you will be happy with this 50 package, it is perfect for my printer. (Canon Selphy ES 30) Maybe amazon needs to check that info, but it works, I promise."
3,good pictures for the price.,"I have had this printer for years and is still working good with each ink and paper i order! will buy another when this runs out.\\\\ However i did not need to replace ink and paper i ordered until return policy ended, I ordered wrong photo pack put it in and broke photo pack, my fault just pay attention when ordering."
4,Good product,"Have had this for well over a year now,and still works perfectly with frequent use. Plan on another for the camper."
2,Did not work as expected,"I purchased this item to replace the ""Houdini"" that I had previously. I was not unhappy with the other product, just wanted to try something new. I found the Vacu Vin difficult to work with. The tool is difficult to position on the stopper and it is nearly impossible to tell when the vacuum has been adequately created without releasing the stopper and starting over again. I returned it and exchanged it for the Houdini which is much easier to use----you definitely know when you've created the proper vacuum with the Houdini."
5,works perfectly!,"I bought this hoping it would help keep our opened bottles of wine fresh for a few days until we could finish a bottle. My husband and I like to drink a glass of wine in the evening, but we don't usually want to drink the whole bottle in one night. This product has worked perfectly for that use! I haven't kept opened wine with this for more than three days, so I can't say if it lasts as long as the manufacturer claims, but for three days it has been great. We are not wine connoisseurs by any means, but we can tell if wine is spoiled.I really like the way the stopper clicks to let you know you've pumped all the air out. This is what made me chose this pump over theMetrokane Houdini Wine Preserver."
5,Very Nifty Gadget,"This device is perfect for anyone who finds that they don't consume an entire bottle of wine at one sitting and would like to preserve the wine for as long as possible without it ruining. Wine can be an expensive luxury and there is nothing worse than having it turn to vinegar due to improper storage. This device is amazingly simple to use and works perfectly. Simply insert one of the rubber stoppers into the open bottle of wine, place the pump over the top and pump about 5 to 6 times until you hear a distinctive ""clicking"" sound and you are done. All of the excess oxygen in the bottle has now been removed and the wine is vacuum sealed. When ready to re-serve the wine, simply press the nib on top of the stopper to release the vacuum, remove and serve. It couldn't be any easier or simpler. Well worth the price and you may want to consider purchasing the extra stoppers if you tend to have more than a couple of bottles open at any one time."
3,"Good seal, but can't keep wine completely fresh","Ethanol (alcohol) reacts with oxygen to form acetaldehyde, which then becomes acetic acid, a.k.a. vinegar. This is why wine tastes like crap the day after the bottle is opened. This Vacu Vin product is easy to use, and forms a tight seal on wine bottles. The seal prevents more oxygen from entering the bottle, effectively limiting the ethanol to vinegar reaction. Unfortunately, the reaction still proceeds somewhat, because when the bottle is sealed, there is still oxygen-containing air in the empty space.So all in all, this product does limit the ethanol to vinegar reaction, but in order to really eliminate it, you would also need one of those CO2 sprayers to fill the empty space in the bottle."
2,Screw this product-just reuse the original cork and save yourself some money,I expected this thing to seal my wine up properly but it didn't really last any longer than any other rubber stopper or the cork that came with the bottle. It works I guess...just not that well
3,Alright,"I wasn't extremely happy with this, not sure if I'm using it propely, but will keep on using it until i get it together"
5,i'm less of a drunk...,it keeps my wine fresh & it's easy to use. i no longer feel like i have to finish a bottle so as not waste it.
4,Works well.,"I needed something to help preserve the flavor and quality of my wine, as one bottle often lasts me over a week or more. The Vacu Vin draws the air out of the bottle with only a few pumps and the plug they furnish holds tight until you want to use it again. I would recommend this."
5,This works like magic,"I had a similar item made by a different manufacturer before that was ""accidentally"" thrown away by a family member, so this was a replacement. This works so much better than that other item. The other one would lose vacuum after a day or two, but this one maintains vacuum for over 5 days. I even had one bottle (of a very good wine) that we left from weekend to weekend and the suction remained in tact. The clicking noise is really a great feature to let you know when the vacuum is at the right pressure. Overall an excellent item."
5,"Straight forward, easy to use and it works!",Out of all the products I have ever tried... this is the best yet. And as long as you take proper care of it there really isn't much to break I've had mine for years and just got this one for a friend.They also have food containers now which i think i may try out.
4,Especially if you daydream about a European lifestyle...,"... this title will indulge you richly. It was categorically cinematic - each page plays out like a scene in the mind's eye. Having just read some not-so-light novels, I was surprisingly just as interested in this light read, and rather enjoyed myself."
3,Breezy Fun,"Had I realized this book was by the author of the wildly popular ""A Year in Provence"" I probably would have passed it by, but as it was, I didn't, and the retro jacket caught my attention. This book probably exemplifies light reading to me, an airy comedy with a likable hero and love interest on the run from picaresque international villains. The plot revolves around an unemployed Englishman living in the south of France who gets unwittingly involved in a mastermind's attempt to corner the global truffle market. The book will hold more resonance for those who have traveled in the south of France and are interested in gastronomic delights, but even the rest of us can enjoy the silly story as it floats by."
1,just a toy ...,"Not what we expected , finger holes don’t seal well, and it doesn’t play in tune ... Mouthpiece is uncomfortably thick ... Still searching for the high octave... Disappointing at best !!! i’d return it if i hadn’t already put my mouth on it ..."
2,Xaphoon,"Very disappointed in this instrument. If I could return it, I would. It has a very awkward fingering position, the mouthpiece is nothing close to a typical sax or clarinet, and is not removable, so don't believe that you'll be able to use any other mouthpiece. I play sax and repair them as a side hobby. I thought this would be a good one to use as a carry-all, and not have to do much of a learning curve....... not!!! I would not suggest this for any type of ww replacement/filler. Not user friendly."
3,Shipping & Handling Charaged over charged,Beware!! This light weight little pocket sax (Maui Xaphone) shipping and handling charge is more than $11 when other suppliers' charges are within the range of $3.99 to $8.Anyhow it sounds not too bad.
5,Therapy,"I am very ill. Occipital neuralgia (toothache in the brain), MSA (degenerative brain disease), and no cures. I was a guitarist, percussionist, singer, and a flute player. The past 4 years of my life have been located somewhere below hell. I suffer from level 10 headaches daily, as my brain slowly dies. Please don't cry for me. I OWN A XAPHOON!!Just opened the the box and played this tool for happiness and found hope. It is without any doubt the most wonderful thing to happen for me in the past 4 years! TheXaphoon Pocket Sax Black Finish Key of Cmoves the pain into the background of my life. What a joy. I am using this instrament as a tool. Thanks Amazon!! ish"
4,Rise of the Footsoldier.,"Different than your Snatch,Lock stock and Layercake, almost on another level really, while there is nothing wrong with those movies at all,the intensity of this movie and that is based on a true story. I didn't think the English were so Barbaric, from Hooliganism(I have a strong distaste for Anarchy) to Gangsterism,This Brutal and Gritty British Tale will make you feel you were there."
3,I agree with Bad Johnny,"No reason to reiterate everything he said, just read his review. Decent 3 star movie, although kinda long and I'd like to see someone count the number of times they used the word 'c*%t' - as after the first billion, we get the idea, they are foul mouth bad boys."
2,Pass this one by,"I had high hopes for this sprouter. Unfortunately the design is flawed. The reasons are as follows: 1) the trays do not stack well, 2) little seeds get stuck in the drainage holes even though there are red plastic caps that should prevent this, 3) the red plastic drainage caps come off and are easily lost, and 4) unless you have a cool location, mold grows easily on the sprouts rendering them useless.My advice is to pass this one by and use a Mason jar. I'm currently using two pickle jars with their original lids. I simply poked holes in the metal lids and paid nothing for something that works better than this $40 Biosta Sprouter contraption. Too bad since they have a good idea that was poorly implemented. It's a miracle they can sell any at all."
5,A Diamond in the Rough You Need!,"Unlike other various hits collections, this CD actually presents original hits without any type of hatchet job editing. Though many of the tracks are readily available elsewhere (""If I Can't Have You,"" ""Boogie Oogie Oogie,"" ""Just What I Needed,"" and many other dance-related songs), where else could you find Flash & the Pan's cult rocker ""Hey St. Peter"" or the elusive #1 hit ""Too Much, Too Little, Too Late"" by Johnny Mathis & Deniece Williams? Rockers ""Don't Look Back"" and ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light"" are presented in their full uncut glory."
2,"Great, BUT NO ANSWERS!!!!","This book is great in the aspect of it helps you to think critically, BUT it does not offer any answers to the case studies you are working on, so there is no way to know if you are on the right track or not. I was EXTREMELY disappointed when I recieved this book and saw there were no answers in the back of it."
4,"Nice and sturdy, but bigger than I had expected","There's nothing wrong with these nets. They're sturdy and will last and last. However, I wanted something to catch the critters the cats schlepp in through the cat door, and for that purpose, they're a bit oversized. I'd recommend getting out a measuring tape and making sure you want nets of this size. Also, they don't come with a pole."
3,Poor Customer Service,"The product itself is fine, but the company who sells it is the problem. When I didn't receive the item after two weeks I emailed Douglas Net Company twice, but received no reply. After tracking down a phone number on my own - it is not posted on their Amazon page, look for yourself - the man was very nice, but could not provide a tracking number or any other information about the shipping. When it still hadn't arrived a week later I called back and he again was very nice and agreed to send a replacement, which I promptly received in 4 days. I rate them poorly because of failure to provide tracking information, which is pretty standard practice these days, for failing to reply to emails, and for not providing contact information on their Amazon page. I would not buy from them again."
2,"nice characters, really slow story line","the lead characters were very well developed, esp the heroine. they both were charming and surrounded by other characters who possessed the same qualities. my biggest gripe is that the story moved at a snail's pace. a good editor could have tightened this novel up and it would have been much more enjoyable. as to the plot line with the villian, no real explanation as to the animosity there. great history lesson though."
2,Misleading pricing,"It looks good, but they charge $5 per item for shipping! Reasonable if you are only buying one, but I wanted to buy 20 - that meant $100 shipping!to me, that doesn't seem like a 'shipping' charge but a way to boost the price without giving Amazon their cut"
2,Not Good,The capsules are moist and slightly sticky. I have to wash my hands after handling/taking them.It seems to be a quality control issue with the capsules themselves as I had also found broken empty capsule pieces in the bottle. It's apparent that the capsules are too permeable which causes the stickyness. Recommendation: Do not buy. Thank you.
5,happy mom,"My son reads like a maniac, so it is always a challenge to find him books he hasn't read yet! He loves the whole Boba Fett Series. For Star Wars, this series is not really complicated. Some of the other ones are very thick books and the concepts get really deep. The Boba Fett's are quick enjoyable books."
4,"Out, Out Darn Water Spots","Mr. Clean auto dry system is easy to use and really brings out the maximum shine on your car.The only problem I have encountered is in trying to find the product. Target and Kragen used to carry Mr. Clean's Auto Dry system but no longer, so I was extremely happy to find it on Amazon.com ..."
1,Rubbish,You are better off with a sponge and a bucket . There ain't a quick fix to washing your car without going to the local car wash!
3,From an exchange student coordinator,"I am an exchange student coordinator for students that come from very different cultures from the United States. This book was somewhat helpful to me in discovering different ways to explain to families concepts such as ""unspoken rules"" or how to treat an exchange student within your household, as well as cultural differences.This book does help families understand their undetected cultural biases in a way that I haven't seen in other publications.Not all host families work out and I intend to use this book as a resource for families that are having challenges arranging to life with an exchange student.I have directly supervised 9 students over 1.5 years and indirectly with hundreds more."
3,Good for the price,"The quality of these coasters was somewhat below my expectations, but overall they're a decent value. One of the posts on the stand was slightly out of place, but the coasters still fit in well enough. They make an annoying clacking sound when you place a glass on them, though."
5,Wow I am amazed!,"This lego sets is amazing! I cannot believe that the can actually form a big lego piece like this! that is so cool. Your Buddy, ??????????"
1,Lost much with departure of original B.Siege bass&drummer,Earlier tracks showed genuine individualistic creative theme that was driven particularly by the brilliant percussion and independent bass lines. This CD; struggling to find his own position.
4,Robbery at the Pharmacy,"One day Jess and Liz are at the pharmacy when one BAD clown strolls in and robs the place..at gun-point!!It is an upsetting experience for the girls,especially when their good friend Joe is accused of the crime!!Elizabeth is sure Joe is innocent and that some total jerk is framing him,and she decides to do some detective work,hence the title ELIZABETH THE SPY."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This does not contain any original recordings. If you buy this, you'll regret in 3 minutes."
3,A Thoughtful Little Memoir,"This is a thoughtful memoir that highlights an interesting world many readers will be unfamiliar with. A quick, easy introduction into the Caribbean and what it means to be human during a period of colonialism."
2,Book not worthy of Subject,"I admit it, I'm a huge Beck fan. So I was disappointed in this effort. The book relies on all the old magazine articles and websites as its sources. It would have been more effective, and interesting, had the author interviewed Beck himself, his family, band-mates, and music critics. For those who are interested in Beck's multi-talents, check out the book ""Playing with Matches."" Though not a book directly about Beck's music, it does give an interesting back ground on his artistic influences, namely his grandfather Al Hansen. One final note, while I feel that the writing was vague and magazinish, the photographs were excellent."
1,Not that Tough,"I bought this toy for Christmas last year and by February I exchanged it at the store because the sounds quit working. That wouldn't be a big deal except you need the sounds to know when the picture is taken, thus keeping the camera still and keeping the pictures from being too blury. The picture quality is ridiculous. Now the second camera is broken. My daughter was 6 at the time and treats her toys very well. I thought it would hold up better, given the title and the commercials showing it being dropped down stairs."
3,"Kids love it, but the pictures are awful","I would give this 1 star if not for the fact that my kids do seem to enjoy it. The pictures are horrendous, most of the time, you cant even make out who/what the picture is of.I will say that they are super durable, having been dropped dozens of times over the year weve had them.I wish fisher-price would have thought enough of our kids to make it even 1 megapixel, so the kids could enjoy thier photos more."
2,"Durable, but the quality is not that Great","We gave this camera to my 3-year-old for Christmas. She loves the camera. It is easy for her to use, and the buttons are easy to understand. The double-eye view finder is nice and the on-screen view is nice, but the pictures are just not the best quality. Most of them are too dark or overexposed. As much as she loves the camera, I am still not sure if we will keep it or return it for one that is cheaper, and takes better quality pictures (not a kids camera). Fisher-Price didn't put much effort into this camera. It's sad."
5,Great purchase!,"With a working flash, a double view finder, a larger (than the older version) display, easy to work controls to scroll, delete and turn on and off, it's approx. 60 picture internal memory, the durability and attractive look for a toddler; there's only one more thing that you could ask for and that's a bit better picture quality. The pros FAR outweigh the con. To me, it was just a bit pricey, but I think we have gotten what our money paid for! My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES this, and out of everything it has already become her favorite gift, the strap never leaving her wrist! She LOVES seeing her pictures, and taking pictures of everything, including little piggy-toes, the wall, or the dog's tail! LOL.This is a big hit in our home.... Though where I bought my new version of this item, it was $69.00, so shop around for a good price. :)"
4,Fisher Price Kid Tough Digital Camera - Pink (New Version),I received the Fisher Price Kid Tough Digital Camera - Pink (New Version) and everything was as promised. This is a Christmas present and has not been used yet. I sure it will be great.
1,Not worth it,I bought this book thinking I'd learn some stuff about knife throwing but I had already learned a lot of the things mentioned online or through experience. I'm not saying the book is 100% useless but it definitely wasn't worth it.
3,"Perfect Point TK-017-3B Throwing Knife Set, 3 Piece (7.5-Inch Overall)Perfect Point TK-017-3B Throwing Knife Set, 3 Piece (7.5","Great book for the novice. You can do just as well by going to ""You Tube"" and watching the free instructional video's in which everyone has a different opinion and style on knife throwing."
4,Good buy,This book was brand new! The only problem was is that it took a very long time to get ing the mail!!! It took approximately 1 month to arrive!!
1,Not for New Zealand or Fiji,"I purchased this product especially for my trip to New Zealand and Fiji. Product did NOT Work At All, very disappointed with this item. Had to borrow someone else adapter for my laptop and cell phone. Left the product in Fiji, didn't bother bringing it back, what a waste of money."
3,instruction error,The instructions recommended a different adapter head to be used in Buenos Aires. We only took the one that was recommended. The one we were told to use in BA did not work. Fortunately we were able to use the adapter without the extra piece and it worked.
4,Does the job,"Not great quality, but what I expected for the price. I'm a flight attendant and travel internationally quite a bit, so extra adapters come in handy rather than always having to charge one thing up & then switching the adapter to another device. I'm happy with them."
4,Basic converter,Bought this for our trip to Europe and it worked fine. There's nothing special about these adapters but be careful because you can't use grounded plugs and all it does is convert the plug so you need to make sure the device you plug in supports the different voltage (most new devices do and it's written on the device or adapter).
5,Living the Life,"Heh, if you don't have this game yet, buy it. It's fun, you know that, and when the sequel comes out on Xbox wouldn't it be nice to know what you're doing in Hong Kong instead of Japan? Living the life of a Japanese teenager in the eighties might not sound super exciting, or even semi-exciting, but you're not exactly a ronin cramming for enterance exams here. You practice in the dojo, collect information on Chinese cartels and play old acrade games! And drink coffe in a can! And feed a kitty! (Check out the Penny Arcade archives, that comic's a good explantion of the game.) Come on, even being a fork-lift operator is fun! It's not like you have to do it from nine to five like you'd have to in real life.You know you want it, it's (relatively) (inexpensive) now, so make yourself happy and get it."
5,Amazing,This game is absolutly amazing and really thats all i have to say about it. The game play is great and the graphics are stunning as well as the fact that the story line is probally the best ive ever seen in a game.
4,NOT BAD,THIS GAME HAS SO-SO GRAPHICS. SO WHO CARES IF THE GRAPHICS COST MORE THEN 1 MILLON DOLLERS. THEIR POP-UP GRAPHICS . FOR THE GAMEPLAY IT'S AWSOME. THE DUDE WANT'S REVENGE ON SOME OTHER DUDE FOR KILLING HIS FATHER(WHO WOULDN'T)...
2,shenmue,"yes i have had this game for about a week and i have allready completed all three dics. I give this game 2 stars becouse in the book it said to have the object of the game by april 1987 and you start in dec.3,1986. Now don't get me wrong the game is great and the game play is great,but any game that take's 6 years to make sould take at least 2-3 mounths to get threw.If the people that made this game plan on have more dics to buy that's great they would get more stars but only god knows how long that will take,look it took 6 year for this one if it take another 6years for the next by then you will have no clue on what's going on in the game."
4,Where are discs four and five?,"Shenmue was a great experience. Even if you're a total lunkhead and can't follow the plotline, there are so many ways to pick up additional clues without leaving the game itself. The 'practice' system of improvement is stunningly realistic, if a bit boring at times. I'd love to wait through and see the seasons pass (there was a guy in a Santa Suit on the streets at Christmas). On the other hand, the game, while great in plot, mechanics and stunning visuals...was painfully short. I flew through the discs and finished in no time. There's a lot I missed, of course, but still, it would be nice to have more subquests."
3,A game worth playing.,"I can remember waiting,almost painfully in anticipation for this mysterious game to come out. I can recall reading in magazine's such as Game Pro that in Shenmue you will be able to follow anyone you want in their day to day life from morning to nightfall and on top of this it would pretty much be like playing an interactive Kung Fu movie. Plus you could connect to the internet and download additional content,and your hi score's from mini games would be posted for the world to see!Did Shenmue deliver this?Yes.............And no. All this and more was their but it failed to pack the punch it promised,but don't let that keep you from trying this Dreamcast classic out. What makes Shenmue so unique is that it was a forerunner to modern gaming,yet retained a curious little individuality about it.Shenmue was an experiment which bridged together last gen gaming with the current gen. A hype machine that didn't fully deliver,yet showed us the future all the same.Check it out."
5,This game was awsome!,"I loved this game!!!! I was so wrapped up in it that i ended beating it in 2 months (shenmue time) you were supposed to have finished disc one by around april, i beat it by the 5th or 6th of December, then disc two, finished that in a matter of (shenmue timed) days, disc 3 left you hanging though. I'm yearning for the second, which is due out this fall. The time system was excellent, fight sequences were extremely fun. My favorite part was the 70 man gang fight, i've never had so much fun! In real time, i beat this game in about 5 days, i was totally sucked into it. I have yet to find an equal match to this game, graphics-amazing, gamplay-good, story-awsome. overall one of the best games, ever."
2,"NOT THAT GREAT, SLOW PACE AND bad CONTROL","Well I thought I was getting sooooooo much more after all the hype, but honestly this was just plain boring. Pretty to look at, but shoddy controls and not enough fun stuff to do. mostly running around talking to npcs[non player characters]and opening doors looking for npcs. YAWN!!!!!!!!Yes it looks pretty but unless you like long drawn out storys and watching a game more then playing skip it ....."
5,Very good graphics helpful for kids to learn,"I learned about this book from readers of my websiite. Several people bought this book and also the mini version through my links to Amazon... although I did not have even this book in my recommended book list!I thought that there must be something about this book so I ordered it also. I was very pleased when I received it since my daughter loves it!The dictionary has a good amount of Polish-English vocabulary divided into thematic sections. It has also a graphic which is pleasing to the eye, especially for the children since they neeed nice graphic to understand the text! This book has a larger selection of words than the mini-book version, so it would teach children a richer vocabulary. But the mini-book can be easier to start. So, I recommend the whole series."
2,was looking for more hot sex,"This book has seen it's share of hype lately so I thought I'd jump on the bandwagon and read it. If you want a book loaded with lesbian safe sex then this is the one to get, however keep an open mind about this for everything the author states as facts is not necessarily true. Safe sex is important but a lot of the information about stds is unfounded and already obsolete. I was hoping to find more hot and dirty sex tips and such, this book was rather bland and offered up a selection of commonplace and intuitive practices. This is a good selection for the neophyte who is paranoid about lesbian safe sex but I would look elsewhere for some truly informative literature."
1,Not worth it!,Pictures were horrible and it's mostly adds for porn sites. Would not recommend at all. You could learn more by watching a porno. Don't waste your money
2,The first italian long feature cartoon,"The first italian long feature cartoon (1949, italian title ""La rosa di Bagdad"" - The rose of Bagdad). The masterpiece of Anton Gino Domeneghini, with beautiful scenery, dialogues and characters. Winner at the 10th Venice Film Festival in 1949. The music (by Riccardo Pick-Mangiagalli) is elegant and fascinating (Julie Andrews was engaged as the singing princess in the american version!). The animation techniques, even though a little bit primitive and clearly influenced by Disney's films, are really attractive. Absolutely not to lose!"
3,Go easy,Some things to watch out for: Belt alignment needs to be closely monitored and don't rush sanding by taking too much at a time. Works well on those wide boards where your belt sander would leave an uneven surface.
1,"Not really stainless steel, watch for the plastic inside bowl","I was delighted to find this product as i thought it was stainless steel. It was meant as a gift, and so by the time the box was opened it was past the 1 month return policy. While the spinner operates smoothly, etc.. the inner basket is plastic... NOT stainless steel. I would expect that when something is advertized as stainless steel, there should be mention of an inner plastic spinner bowl. I would otherwise have stuck with my $10 spinner from walmart, as the food still makes contact with plastic. This was clearly a miscommunication problem by amazon... and a costly one for me."
1,Poorly designed. Made to fail quickly.,"Do not waste your money on this spinner. Stainless steel is great, but all the parts that do the work are made of cheap plastic. The gears started failing in 6 months and the handle broke at 9 months. The bowl is now a very expensive doggy watering dish.I've had an OXO stainless for 2.5 years and is still working fine even though the top is cracked from being dropped once (or twice;-)."
3,Gory True Crime Book!,"Hadden Clark is a very sick man. The book was very detailed in explaining his pedigree history. He was not born inbred but rather in upscale Connecticut suburb of New York City. He probably had a lot more chances than most to accomplish something with his life. His crimes are unforgiving towards females in general. His family history and relationships seem to cover up any notion of his crimes. What made him this way? Well, that would be asking what made Charles Manson such a criminal. We know Charles Manson came from insanity and prisons while Hadden Clark's personal relationships are never really developed particularly with women. He reminds of Ed Gein who inspired Psycho. Whatever the cause of his crimes, Hadden Clark should never be released to the public."
3,IT'S OKAY.,The binding and cover of this book were not in good condition but the pages were just fine. What I've read so far has been very interesting.
2,Hannibal Lecter better describes Hadden Clarks brother.,"This book was nothing like I expected. Seeing the cover, I beleive that Hadden Clark was a cannibal, but after reading the book I didn't buy it one bit. After all the only part in the book that actually shows any cannibalism on Hadden's part was when he drank some blood and it was'nt even human. Don't get me wrong, he's still a sick son of a xxxxx and so was the rest of his family, except his sister, but if the author wanted to compare someone with Hannibal Lector it should of been Hadden Clark's Brother Brad. Personally I would have made the book about his brother."
2,A Nobel-Prize Winner Wrote This?,"I'd never have guessed. It was too short and slapdash to be all that useful. I don't really know what one was supposed to get out of it. If I had no formal physics training and this was all I read I don't think I'd be all that informed. The major concepts the book covers have been covered better elsewhere. As for modern physics, there are better ways to learn (Physics for the Rest of Us, Schroedinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality, Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed, even the book Einstein himself wrote as a primer for relativity--while flawed--was decent). As for the classical stuff, there are simply too many primers better than this to really list."
5,Physics explained by a Curious Character!,"Judging by the sheer number of biographies and other books, Dr. Feynman was indeed a most curious character. His voice, New York accent and humorous and direct delivery make this lecture series a joy to listen to. Physics has never been so clear and enjoyable!"
4,Six easy pieces,"Feynman is easy to understand even for the physically challenged. This book is a great place to start for those just getting into physics. Feynman applies this science to things in life that I, even as a first year physics student, began to get a grasp on as the book progressed. Other books I had started to read on this field were boring and it was easy to lose focus. I would find myself pages ahead but realizing I hadn't caught anything of what I just read. With this book it was interesting enough where if I didn't get something the first time I actually wanted to go back and double check. Six Easy Pieces really is pretty easy."
5,I learned a great deal of home improvement information,"The other books I have purchased by this author were excellent so I bought this one also and am very happy with my purchase. Renovating our home has been a MAJOR expense and project so we wanted to make sure that we did everything in the most energy efficient and cost effective way. There were countless tips and methods to greatly reduce our utility bills with the renovation work that we learned in this book. We had a house builder do the renovation work we couldn't do ourselves but we still used this book to in a way give advice to the builder to do the renovations so they will cut our electric, heating and air-conditioning bills. Our builder was quite surprised at how much we knew about energy efficient renovations. But we can't take the credit since it was all learned from this book. Highly recommended book if you're want to learn how to greatly reduce your utility bills."
2,not sized for 13,I just recived these and cann't even put them on I'm a 13 EEEE even the area where you put you're foot is very narrow
2,Beeping sound is annoying,This thermometer beeps the entire minute until it reaches the peak tempurature. I've been using this for over 2 weeks to help me track ovulation. That means taking my temp as soon as I wake up everyday. So every morning I use this and try to discretely take my temperature while my husband is still asleep. Needless to say that doesn't work since this thing beeps rather annoyingly the entire time. I'm off to get a new BBT thermometer today.
1,SLOW.... and inaccurate,"This thermometer is SUPER slow. I had it all ready on travel and needed to check my 6 month olds temp rectally. Unfortunately 1 1/2 - 2 minutes later, nothing. I was so frustrated I tried to break it in half! I couldn't so that's a positive point to this thermometer. When I tried this product on myself it did take a long time (2 minutes and that is a generous estimate) and it was 2 degrees low (taken orally). I contacted the company and they found they were having the same problem. Maybe it was a bad batch? I purchased it in May 2009. They refunded my money (thank you), but I was still in the market for a good digital thermometer. I trusted the positive reviews on the BD Thermometer but wasn't happy with the product myself.If you want fast, accurate and reliable try the Vicks Digital Thermometer Speed Read. I have one and am planning on ordering 2 more!"
2,Takes forever to get a reading,"you may think this is a minor concern, but all other digital thermometers we have had take much less time. Other than that it seems fine and accurate"
3,Good concept poor execution,"This games graphics and music are amazing(i wish more games were as colorful as this) the gameplay is a good idea but they couldve done it a lot better, you kind of have to give it the benefit of the doubt though cause its a new idea but still it couldve been better"
3,It gets boring fast...,"I played this and the one on the Xbox, trust me if you have not played it yet it is not worth your time. But if you are a fan or a dreamcast collector, get it. The game has unique points but it loses its flare in one day. I give it 3 instead of 1 because i know it is not a terrible game to most people, but to me it is terrible since i play fighting and RPG games. I did not buy this on amazon.com."
4,This game stands the test of time.,"I've had my Dreamcast since launch day, yet never played this game. It's pretty good. The graphics are fun looking and the gameplay is simple yet fun. Since I just played it I don't have the ""nostalgia goggles"", I have to say that this is one of the better games for Dreamcast. It's in a genre of its own and I would recommend this to anyone."
3,Campy Fun,"Was not a great monster film. But it was never meant to be taken seriously. It's a good campy throwback to monster movies of the 50's and 60's. This is this first movie I ever saw Mary Elizabeth Winstead in and one of the main reasons I bought this DVD. Adam West has a turn as a ""mad scientist"". He does a good job of it."
2,2 MONSTER ISLAND in pan & scan scam,"Being like a Harryhausen film I expected at least 5 monsters. There were 2 stop motion types (tho 2 of one and a few of the other), and a dumb creature from the monster lagoon (ohh not again).Ohh, plus one dummy spider for 1.5 seconds that doesn't move.The stop motion is as good as any.You can see from the clips in the behind the scenes it is cropped from the original widescreen! What a mistake for an effects intravoganza (or any DVD unless having 2 versions).I am over the age of 13."
2,"Good coffee, durabilty not so good","There is no denying that this maker produces a good cup of coffee or that it looks cool, however we had a problem with the pot developing hair-line cracks around the bottom. This allowed liquid to seep into the base where the electrical parts are. We thought we may have just gotten a bad one so we contacted the manufacturer who sent us a replacement without any hassle. Unfortunately we've had the same problem with the replacement ( though it did last longer than the first - I think it's been about 1 year ). The handle also recently broke off which makes it pretty much unusable because there is nothing to grip while removing the top part or while pouring. If anyone is wondering, no the pot was not handled roughly or abused. We will not be buying another!"
5,The best of the Harry Potter Lego Sets,"My 9-year old and 6-year old sons received several Harry Potter Lego sets for Christmas and the Hogwarts Express is by far the best of the bunch!! Although all of the Harry Potter Legos are realistic to the movie and books, the Hogwarts Express is sturdy and therefore more fun to play with than the other sets. Definately worth the money for the Harry Potter Lego fan."
5,Legos - Harry Potter -- need I say more?,Got this for my son for Christmas. He had it out of the box and put together before the day was over. It's got all the great little pieces that legos now come with these days.
1,The Ungiving Tree,"The actual story of The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein , is wonderful. I had read it as a child and hoped to read it with my son. Unfortunately, after waiting so long for it to come I found that it was not a story, just an activity guide for people to do with their children AFTER reading the story. I think that this was misleading, and all potential buyers should know that you need to purchase the book somewhere as well. Who knows, it could be a fantastic activity guide. I will find out after I find a copy of the book and read it."
1,Very Poor Tech Support...,"Had trouble with PalmPad Remote and could not get any one to help me. 800 Phone#, chat line, tech support. Very very bad customer support for this product. Would NOT recommend!"
2,"So narrow, and small","I ordered these for a figure show and I received them promptly, I was hoping with the wider toe they would be wider, but I couldn't even get my foot into them, I may have to reorder two sizes bigger than I normally do. The plastic strap isn't forgiving - at all."
5,Contains a lot of good material,It was the only text book I had to use for a History of Philosophy course. It has all your first philosophers and many good works by them.
5,Not a run and gun game....for once!!!!!,"This is one of the best games that has been released for Xbox. Battle Engine Aquila is truly revolutionary; there is simply no other game like it. The best aspect is that you know that you aren't alone on the battle-field; you are part of a whole. However, if you want to simply take on the whole Muspell army yourself, you will summarily beat down. You have to use your forces and realize that you are support for your team, and nd not the other way around. This game is the first of its kind, and is most definitely worth the money. BUY THIS GAME!!!"
4,Good tool,Works great. Over all good quality. The guard at the tip should have been steel not cast. It broke wholly but there is no effect on the tools operation.
4,"Good, nice and cheap","I've used this with a Palm TX and am very happy with the results.Pros:It does protect the device screen and I don't see a big difference regarding the brightness.It's very cheap.Cons:Cutting the protector to the right size and applying it correctly is kinda hard and time consuming. I would recommend to do it when you are bored and have nothing to do.I'd also recommend to disable the password protection if enabled, before applying the protector. It has happened to me that the calibration gets messed up and it's very painful to enter the password to access the device."
1,This is a waste of money,"Mr.Clean Auto Dry is a product that has the capability of being a major success, but the reason i rate it one star is because the fact that you have to wash it in the shade. If you wash it in the sun your car is going to look like crap. Next, lets say you run out of soap and filter and you need a refill. Would you like to pay at least $30 for 3 more washes with the Mr.Clean auto dry car wash? Finally, if you don't sponge EVERY PART OF THE CAR YOU WANT CLEAN and then use the auto dry feature, it will turn out like crap. Don't buy this product. You will waste your money."
2,Works ok... expensive to use,"The filter does not last as long as advertised making this an expensive tool to wash your car. It is cheaper, faster and more effective to go to a do it yourself car wash. The soap doesn't seem very strong and there is streaking when dry. I threw mine away (P&G does offer a gaurantee, so save the box)."
2,I should have known...,"Since I had trouble finding this product, I should have realized that it was no longer made. Can't get anymore filters except on ebay for a ridiculous price. Guess I will just use it like a hose nozzle that I can put soap in to help wash the car and RV."
2,Not what I expected.,"I got this book to get inspiration for designing a home that would promote a healthy athletic lifestyle. It didn't give me what i wanted.The book has some nice photos of some nice homes, but they are not in anyway inspirational to a fit lifestyle. Nothing new, nothing great."
5,First thing I bought on Amazon.,I was just trying out buying things online and I sort of wanted this. I still have it and it still looks new. Great buy.
3,cheap,"the glasses went great with my daughters halloween costume but i hate to say that one of the lenses kept popping out. you get what you pay for i guess. service was great, received quickly!"
2,no,"At first glance these sunglasses look really good, they are highly reflective though not chrome like it looks in the pictures. However when putting them on they are awkwardly large, and I have an average sized head/face. The frame wasn't straight either, it took some bending to get them to sit level on my face, and the whole time I was worried they might snap. Also the nose rest isn't made well, even with some bending of the pads they still sit low and fall down the bridge of my nose easily. Overall, not worth the $4, you don't get what you pay for with these, you get less."
3,Eh... Fair.,"I ordered from Gravity Trading, after hearing so many bad reviews about Private Island.The glasses came a little warped. They had no case, and that was a downside. The lens were smudged up, they came with a warped frame, and the part that lays behind your ears isn't long enough, so I am constantly having to push the glasses back up to my eyes. Not to mention it was missing out not guard completely.Besides that, they came much better than I had imagined. They were indeed 100% mirrored, good quality, no obvious signs of wear (besides the frame and nose guards), was UV400, perfect darkness level. Overall, worth about what you pay for them. Fair."
4,"Look great, but are large.","The shades look pretty bad ass, but they are much too big. You can bend them a bit to make them fit your face a bit better, but they're big for sure. For $4 I'm not going to complain too much about it though."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This is the biggest rip off ever!! You aren't giving much $$ for them, and it is still a HUGE rip off! These are the cheapest EVER!!! The frame is tiny and flimsy, and will barely stay on your face. My pair broke within the first 24 hours of getting them in the mail. The lenses fell out WHILE I WAS WEARING THEM!!! Do NOT buy these!"
2,I got what I paid for,"I had a pair of gunmetal 80s purple aviators for a year, loved them and they were stolen. Got another pair wore them for a year. Needed a new pair and I saw these, for $3.60 and my 80s purple sunglasses were $10.00I ordered them they got here and they are so dark I can't see anything. Definitely can't drive in them. Really tough to adjust the sunglasses to fit my face.Order came right on time and packaged nicely however."
5,Perfect,"i literally just received mine about 2 minutes ago. my first thought after i pulled em out of the box was that they were very very light weight glasses. the metal used for the frame is like a cheaper kind of copper or something that was painted over with chrome. theres a small chip in the paint so thats how i could tell. its on the inside so you cant see it with them on. they fit perfectly on me (and ive got a fat head lol) the mirror is 100%. and yes, they are UV 400 protection. (at least thats what the small sticker says.) the joints (or whatever they are called) are kind of stiff at first, so be careful when you get them out so that you dont bend them, after a few times they will break in. my over all opinion; great look, great feel, great quality for the price. i definately recommend these. my only complaint is the chrome paint chips fairly easy but you can touch it up. just be careful with them and take care of them and they will be definately worth the money."
1,Scratches on sunglasses,"This sunglasses arrived wrapped by plastic sheet inside a thin small cloth bag. No foams or hardcover for protections, and I found two 1-inch long hair thin scratches on one of the sunglasses.Initially hoped they're only streaks and attempted to clean them with my newly purchased Monster ScreenClean kit, including a special MicroFiber cleaning cloth and Alcohol free spray. But, streaks stays after repeated tries then I realized they are really scratches :("
1,Scratched,I recieved this product so scraatched and beaten up that I wasn't able to use them. Would not recommend nor buy again.
1,Junk,"These are VERY small and low quality (of course, get what you pay for). Don't buy unless you have a small face to go with the small budget."
2,Costume Glasses Only,"They look exactly as pictured. Very cool. Very cheap though, and too dark to wear and be able to see. They are a bit large for a woman."
4,Worth it,"These just don't cost enough to complain... They are cheap glasses, but the lenses are so dark and the frames are comfortable for the price. Yes there are better glasses out there, but not for this price. They perform and look like much more expensive ones. I am very happy to own two pairs."
2,Not for me..,Although the frame is very attractive the lens are too dark. You will not be a very defensive driver using these. Maybe for a short stroll through the park....maybe not.
1,Not so good,"Buy these from Private Island on Amazon instead of this seller. They are much better quality and are packaged properly for lens protection.These sunglasses came in a large carton, with little protection material. They were floating around the box in a plastic baggie.I ordered two pair. Both came with scratched lenses and a damaged frame hinge. I don't know if it was because of the way they are packaged. They may be just poor quality from the manufacturer."
2,Shoulda known,"These arrived, looked pretty cool. Felt damn flimsy. Lens popped right out the second i put the shades on my face. These are novelty glasses, not something you should wear longer than 30 seconds."
1,Horrible,"I Had Bought This Product Because I Thought These Were Very Stylish... I THOUGHT... When I Got These Cheap Glasses They Came With Nothing To Carry Them, And Also The Metal Was Very Cheap Aluminum And Very Bendy...DO NOT BUY THESE"
4,Sweet aviator sunglasses,I received my sunglasses in very good time once my order was placed. They arrived in excellent condition and no defects. They are actually lighter in weight than I expected them to be so a big plus there. I can't wear them while driving though b/c they are a bit too dark. I love them otherwise.
4,Be real,"I have had these glasses for months now, and sure they can get scuffs, but they are almost 100% UV protected. They look very similar to real aviator glasses too.The lenses are 100% reflective, you can't see the eyes behind the. They look great too.Give em a try"
4,"NOT BAD, REALLY NICE AND AWSOME",i got them in as little as 4 days. When they arrived it was not much wrapped but it was in good condition. the mirrors are just perfect. exactly how you imagine in Bad aezz mode. loving them alradey. great and perfect. only thing must be careful is they need very very good care guys ok. if not they WILL brake.
2,Up to u,"""Aviator Sunglasses Silver Frame Mirror Lens""This item is look good and cool in the photo.However, I think it is suitable with its price."
2,They looked cool...,"Pros: Shipping was no problem, it was delivered as promised, within a good timing. Customer service was nice.Cons: The First pair of sunglasses were defective, the glasses were wrapped and the glasses seemed very very cheap. So I called there 1-800 number and they sent me a another pair. It was weird that didn't ask for there defective product. When i got the second pair, they had a big ugly scratch right in the middle of the left lens.Worst 4$ ever spent."
2,aviator sunglasses from private island,the glasses i recevied had a few scratches on the lenses that were visable from the inside of the glasses an the nose pads were all bent up i had ordered some before from this dealer an they were perfect no scratches nothing they fit snug idk what happen this time but i dont think i will be buying any more glasses from this dealer do to the condition that the glasses were in this last time
2,"Cheap, Stylish Stunna Shades","For the price, the sun glasses seemed like a bargain. Unfortunately, you pay for what you get...I can safety say they're the cheapest sunglasses I've ever purchased."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED!!!!!,"THEY MAKE IT SEEM THESE ARE ACTUAL ""AVIATOR"" SUNGLASSES THEY'RE NOT THEY CHEAP KNOCK OFF PIECES OF CRAP DON'T BUY!!!!!!"
3,Fine for the price,"These guys were like 3 or 4 bucks shipped so no complaints, but note that they are BIG and they don't really curve around your face. They don't look a lot more expensive than they are, but they serve my purpose (comedic relief)"
2,"decent for the money, wouldn't buy again","lens quality - poorframe quality - acceptableframe initial bend - poorglasses arrived bent totally ridiculously so they didn't fit my face at all, it wasn't in issue to re-bend them as the frame is made of a reasonable material, although it didn't work out of the box. The lens quality is quite poor as it darkens the incoming light very significantly (it's difficult to see my radio during mid-day in Arizona) and at the same time doesn't feel like it's blocking much light.Overall if you are wearing them for style they take some work to get right but work fine, if you are using them as actual sunglasses they're not the best"
1,They arrived scratched,"they arrived scratched and i was very disappointed, so be careful when you order them, they are not expensive so there is no point in returning them at all when the shipping will cost you as much as these sunglasses cost..."
3,sunglasses,"These sunglasses are really cool but very dark lenses. Good for the snowy slopes of Aspen. If looking good is important to you, these are right up your alley. If it's not too sunny you may want to try Maui Jim's sunglasses, they're perfect for average sunlight."
1,This Item is a crap!!,"The item have the quality of a corner store. Also the item arrive broken, this is the worst buy in my life!"
5,Fave Sunglasses,"They are my absolute favorite sunglasses! I have had aviators before, but these top them all!"
1,WORST EVER,"HORRIBLE PRODUCT i REPEAT DO IT GET THIS AT ALL, i got it and the left side of the ear part was messed up was for the right side. Is completely cheap and flimsy"
2,"Great price, good look","Lousy functionality, in my opinion. They filter out much too much light. I work outdoors and the first day I wore them I had to remove them because I couldn't see what I was doing. Not bad in full sunlight but when one gets in any kind of shadow it's way too dark. The same with driving wearing them."
1,Way to cheap. Better to spend a few more dollars,"These glasses were cheap in price but even cheaper in quality. it's not even worth it, the lens were warped where the tinting didn't stick and the arms are sharp at the ends and hurt your ear"
3,Still waiting,"Everything was fine,the order the purchase and the contacts afterwards...but only one thing is missing...the product...I am still waiting as i have been told, but it has not arrived yet, after a whole monthThanks"
4,Musclesglasses Quality!,"Received these (ordered 2 pairs) for my 6 year old son and my husband who are both huge 'Epic Meal Time' fans. They are great quality and look just like the aviators the Musclesglasses wears on the show. May have to order some more as both our 2 year old and teenage daughter keep borrowing these to wear out. From a performance standpoint I think they are kind of dark. Great for very sunny days, but not so much for cloudier ones. I have to take them off when driving through a tunnel or under a bridge. Huge cool factor though! Great product overall."
4,does the job,"These sunglasses look great! I'm looking at maybe purchasing a few more. With that said, these are definatly cheap sunglasses so don't buy if your looking for something that can take a beating!"
4,ok glasses for money no case included,The mirror glasses are what you would expect for $4.50. The pics show a case but is not included. They make me look hot.
2,Pretty&Cheap,"They're pretty, but flimsy. Very light construction. The lens is not really mirrored, so if you attempting to hide your eyes, forget it. It would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap Chinese knock-off. Gave them two stars simply because they are good looking, but cheap--and they feel that way on your face."
5,on a freshness scale of 1-10 they're an 8.9,"There pretty good shades, you cant see past them unless ur standing in a beam of sunlight, but even then u can only barely see a lil bit behind the mirror side, only bad thing is that one of the lenses came lil chippedbut thts no biggy cuz i also bought the 3 pack so i hav 3 more in perfect condition each wit their own lil pouch....its tiiiiiiight, not the best but 5 stars for the price and mirrorquality"
4,You get what you pay for.,Glasses arrived in a small box.They are very dark.The only problem I have with them is the nose rests are not even causing them to be off-balance.One side pushes harder against my face than the other.
3,A Nice Cheap Introduction to Aviators...,"Copious amounts of awesomeness.These glasses are a nice 'introduction' to Aviator Glasses. They're cool, they look cool, and they'll tell you whether or not you like the style, for 3 bucks. They are cheap, though. Mine had a scratched lens. And I could never quite bend it to the right shape to not sit a little askew (infinitesimally), on my face, or have perfectly matching-pitched ear bars. They're also SO light, that if you have them pushed up on your forehead, they'll fall off the instant you look up.But now I know I like the awesomeness, and they can be a quick backup in a pinch. Like trying out a new style for 3 bucks. Yar."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"The price of these sunglasses, and the ability to be shipped free in two days with prime shipping, was very appealing. When I received them they were too large for my head (and I don't think I have a particularly large head), so I bent them to fit better. This worked except they have a tendency to become crooked and need to be constantly readjusted to look right. Still, $3 is quite a bargain and I was not expecting anything much better. They do look fairly good as well, even thought they may be just a little too big."
2,You get what you pay for.,"For a couple bucks you can't expect these glasses to be of any quality. And they are not. They arrived with some rust on the frame and the lenses are wonky, they don't sit evenly on my face and they are painful to wear. In short, these glasses suck big time. Live and learn I guess..."
3,Nice cheap stylish sunglasses.,"These sunglasses are pretty cheap - both in price and in design. However, you get what you pay for. They look great, the mirrored effect works, however the frame is reallly really pliable and the slightest bend will cause the lenses to pop out. The pad arms aren't easily adjustable and it seems that it cant take too much adjusting else it might break off.Overall, i still like these for a cheap pair of great looking Sunglasses."
1,Horrible,These broke after like 2 seconds. What a waste of money it was to buy these glasses! Wish I hadn't.
4,good!,good product. looks nice. fragile. but they work well and protect the eyes nicely. recommend for a cheap version of aviators!
1,Get what you pay for,"Awful purchase. Glasses were cheap, flimsy, lop-sided, and generally uncomfortable. They don't even really off up much in way of sun/glare protection for your eyes. Don't buy."
2,Too Many Poor Quality Photos,"For me, there is too much poor photography throughout. Some photos are the quality to be expected, however, too many are out of focus, or have too little depth of field for the purpose of the photo, many contain a lot of noise/grain, some apparently are images that were originally small, then printed larger, creating a poor quality image, many were photographed with poor lighting, some could use color correction for the lighting (i.e. on some photos they failed to adjust the color temperature of the photo correctly leaving a few images shot with incandescent lights looking unnaturally yellow - which brings up one more problem: using a single incandescent light as the main light source, which not a good idea when trying to create a beautiful photo, and this was done more than once)."
2,Random Acts of Good Writing,"I had never read anything by Koenig before, hopefully there is nothing else to read by him. He has taken a very good concept, human actions after most of the earth is destroyed by aliens, and reduced it to an almost incomprehensible story. Here and there in the book he actually made enough sense that you kept reading thinking that he may have finally settled down only to be disappointed a few paragraphs later."
4,laser level,"This item is actually quite easy to use, the laser is bright. I was surprise how good it is."
4,Skip Senneka is wrong!,"Skip Senneka suggests Monteleone is ripping off DaVinci code, and nothing could be farther from the truth! If anyone is ripping anyone off, then it would be Dan Brown, who is travelling the same terrirtory as Monteleone has been writing about for 13 years. Monteleone INVENTED the religious thriller with his NY Times bestseller THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB more than ten years ago. EYES OF THE VIRGIN was published in hardcover a YEAR before DAVINCI CODE appeared. To suggest Monteleone is cheap rip-off hack is grossly unfair to a writer who has paid his dues and writes a very good book."
1,Good Game? I don't even think so......,Like war games?? me too. not this one. this game ...!! it will give you around 3 mins. of enjoyment after you figure out how to even move! the graphics are terrible! they're to jumpy to snipe a guy at almost point-blank range. don't waste your money on this thing. there's much better.
1,And what?,"In a paper, it is always important to state why what you are discussing is important. This book is not a paper obviously, but it fails to state why what its talking about is important, and thus it is in essence, seemingly pointless.Essentially while you read this book, you will read one or two sentences making a point, and then several pages of information supporting that point. The problem is, with all the different names and jumps to different time periods, nobody is going to remember all the information supporting the point and the author never goes back to the point being made, so soon you'll forget why he's giving you all this information.I bought this book for a college course, and dare I say, I refuse to sell it because that would be a crime against humanity. Instead, I should opt to give it away and provide my sympathies for whoever will have to read this in the future."
3,Watch band,Band was exactly as described and the shipping was quick. Item arrived a lot sooner than expected !!! The only thing I expected for the price was to receive the spring bar pins so I wouldn't have to re use my old ones.
4,Makes you want more,"I liked this book. It was a quick introduction to writing a book. If I have a criticism, it left me wanting more. So I guess I'll buy Dan's book on self publishing. Of course, this is really a marketing tool."
3,"Terrific, but ......................","I am a life-long Pat Boone fan. The contents of this CD set, which span his early career, is a stroke of genius. It also allowed me to discard many vinyl albums of these songs.My gripes are 1) why repeat certain songs several times throughout the set, and 2) why mix hymns and Christmas music within Pat's ballads?.Over all, I do not regret purchasing this set and encourage other Pat Boone fans to do the same."
2,5 lb. Hershey Bar,"K-mart had this 5 lb. Hershey bar in their flyer this week for $19.99! Weis markets in PA had it on sale for $36.99, regular price $39.99. Shop around before spending close to $100. for this!"
3,Inexpensive Classic Western Entertainment,"Source prints for these television series episodes range from poor to good. Some are very sharp with good density but have noticeable surface noise (SN). Also, you have to contend with a constantly reappearing Platinum Disc Corporation announcement in the screen lower right corner. Obviously, heavy compression is used to squeeze twenty episodes on a disc.But, considering you can find this two-disc collection for $5.00, it is a worth buying. If you own a High Def screen, you are going to be disappointed by all the flaws. This is a classic example of ""you get what you pay for."" In case you don't know, Platinum Disc only exists in name. It was purchased by Echo Bridge Entertainment. HD screen owners should pass on this."
5,good chime when entering the house.,"This product shipped fast and works good when the door opens it sometimes scare me on the way in the house when the chime sounds, so far I havent set to the alarm but works good. Cons too easy to remove from mount."
1,Didn't work on my door,"I attached the alarm as instructed, but it didn't work. It would make noise when i pushed the button, but other then that, it didn't work. I offered to mail back, but they stated that they didn't want, it but I never received my credit. I still have the product in case if you guys still want it back. But I do want my money back."
2,"Warm, but not durable!","These boots are so warm, but only lasted me one season! They are now seperating from the soles and i can put my hand from in the boot right out! :("
2,Reurned and waiting for creditt,I returned the boots as they were a gift that was not wanted. I an waiting for the credit back to my account and was also surprised at the healthy restocking fee. I don't think I will use Amazon again for attire or apparel items.
1,Bearpaw demi boots,The pair of boots that I received were way smaller than the size indicated. So I had to return them. If they were the right size they would of been a nice boot.
2,"Nice warm slippers, but not durable","I bought a pair less than a year ago. They are nice, warm, lightweight slippers and I liked them. But after wearing them for 6 months, the seam between sole and the upper part of the left one got split and it is never fixable. They are not very durable for daily use in a cold place like the mid-west. Very disappointed."
4,Comfy and Cozy,Love my new Bearpaw's boots! They keep my toes nice and warm. I don't wear them out too much in the snow or ice because of the flat bottom. But great to slip out of my snow boots and into my Bearpaws once I'm inside.
3,"Uh, . . . . just OK.","HA!I saw a recommendation of ""The Wealthy Barber"" in a recent newspaper article. OK, so I buy a used copy, read it, mark it up, and send it to my son who needs some help in the world of finances.Actually, it has too much 'story line' for me. I am more of a 'stick-to-the-point' type of reader. I like info that is direct, yet easy to understand. This was written with TOO MUCH time-wasting storyline for me, but maybe my son will be able to get through it and learn something.If I was to do this again I would go to library, get a copy and make a determination as to whether it would be a suitable text for my purposes.ZekeBaja, Colorado"
1,Too many mistakes,"Having used 4 other test success books this one is quite bad. The first chapter on subnetting is awful and has some very simple mistakes. I suggest looking elsewhere. I'm using the MCSE Study Guide from Sybex which is good (some mistakes still), the NTServer 4.0 Networking Resource kit manual and the Transcender exams."
3,Steel Cowboy VHS,"Steel Cowboy VHS-(Not to be confused with Concrete cowboys of years later and worst) has James Brolin in it, Besides that, the movie is decent, it doesn't have good acting of course, But the Truck* 1- White Western Star* is a Neat Truck. Ok Trucker movie,but not good and not the best.(Convoy)"
3,Shipped past expiration date,"I have to admit that to date this film pack has given me no problems regarding the quality of prints it produces. I am happy with that. My only disappointment with this purchase was that the package I received from Amazon was about two months past the expiration date printed on the package. I am aware that the package is probably good well past the expiration date, but this puts some pressure on me to use up the product before it goes bad, rather than holding it for occasional use as I had originally intended."
5,Great Quality Prints at a Fair Price,I have printed about 125 or 130 prints so far with this product and have been quite pleased with the results. The prints are colorful and vibrant and the colors seem true to the subject. The photo packs performed flawlessly in the printer with no paper jams and no other problems. To this point I am very satisfied with this product. I will add more to this review as I continue using the product in the future.
2,last box made pictures look green,"So far I bought 4x50 packs, and the last one produced really green pictures (from 3 different cameras), hope the new pack will not be the same, there are no alternatives for paper."
2,Boring. . .,"Even though this movie was produced by the same people that produced Anne of Green Gables, the two cannot even be compared. There was nothing inappropriate, it was just a boring story line. It is very hard to connect with the characters. A little disappointing. . . and boring."
4,A good place to begin,"I bought this book after beginning the home buying process and have realized a few mistakes I have already made, according to the author. This book's greatest help and heaviest emphasis is on choosing a good, qualified agent which is the info I was searching for, in an easy-to-read format. I recommend this book as a place to start for first-time home buyers."
1,SORRY THEN HELL,"CAN NOT USE BECAUSE THE BATTERY PACK ARE OUT OF STOCK, AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN AVAILABLE????nIce to look at."
5,Highly accessible,"Neruda's early work is both accessible and evocative in ways that are not always literal. It is a shame that it is so difficult to translate. I recommend a bilingual edition to non-native speakers to ensure that you are on track, but remember: translators of Neruda often are not."
5,must see for kids,I think all kids must this at some point it's for all kids of all ages and young adult can see
5,Best Anime,"This timeless anime is filled with great suspense, character development, and humor.It's funny yet engaging at the same time.One of the best Anime of all time."
4,Can finally watch first season again!,It is impossible to find videos of this season anywhere! Even Crunchyroll only goes back to season two.For any nay sayers about an official collection being released. There is an article on Crunchyroll.com about the release of the official collection.
4,great anime,"Really glad they're finally releasing this series on DVD, can't wait to buy the second one!Had to wait quite a while but managed to buy it when Amazon had it proceed at thirty bucks"
4,Christmas Spirit,This CD is a delight for the Christmas season. The reggae music compliments each song and always brings a smile to my face. I originally bought the audio tape on a coastal island city and have started each Christmas season with these songs ever since. I would recommend this CD to any one who is looking for a reggae twist to the standard songs of the season.
4,Fire Sights,"Installed on a post 64 Win 94 top eject. They work great, though requiring a careful installation. File sight dovetail to get exact fit and mount perfect center. Any little marks you make on these aluminum sights can easily be blackened with Birchwood Casey ""Aluma-Black"". You will want to protect the sights - especially the front, when transporting."
3,Swirl Glass Coasters,"I have owned these for a while and I am still enjoying them. However, I do not like how the swirl pattern is starting to wear off..."
4,Heaven's War,"First off, let me state the few things I found wrong with this graphic novel:1. The artwork is mediocre, and really not so hot. I'd like to see it redrawn. It's better art than I can do, but the story deserves better.2. You really need to have read Descent into Hell by Charles Williams before reading this novel.Other than that, it was excellent. This is a graphic novel not just to look at, but to really think about. The climax and conclusion are eucatastrophic (to use Tolkien's wonderful phrase)."
3,Not a High Gain Antenna system,"I bought this to replace a wusb11, mainly because the Linksys site and product description state it has a HIGH GAIN ANTENNA. While it preforms well and was a snap to setup. I could see no difference between the two, reception wise. I could have bought a wusb54g and got the same results for less money. One other thing is that is is quite delicate when used without is's stand. I do like this item but it is quite pricey."
4,Work a lot better than CompUSA USB Wireless G,I'm connecting from a house to another house and that's was working with a recent integrated Dell Laptop where the antenna is the screen. I had to get rid of the laptop and use my desktop computer. I went to buy a USB Wireless G with the name of CompUSA on it and it was so bad that I couldn't even detect that the network was there! So I bought Linksys Wireless-G Portable USB Adapter and it's now working a little bit better than with the Dell Laptop. The only complain is that the installation doesn't give you the choice to not install a software in extra of the driver that replace Windows XP for the administration of the wireless network.
2,Even though American girl is so lovable this was just not......,"I love American Girl don't get me wrong its great for girls! These movies just dissapointed me. I mean it ruined the charm of the book and the play-pretend doll. I think young girls should use there imagination about these things instead of seeing it on TV. Also, the coolest part of American Girl is the books, kids will sstop reading them and just say "" I'll just watch the movie"" We really should encourage them to read and not watch! This ruins all of American Girl and please lets savor the old fashion charm."
5,Excellent representation of characters,My daughter owned an American girl doll since she was six. She is now eight and this was a perfect time for her to watch. Great role models for young girls. I'm so happy we've kept her young and withstood the introduction of Hannah Montana. This is the way to go to preserve their innocence while giving them snippets of this country's history.
4,Solid Viewing for TWEEN GIRLS,"These movies while very simplistic share pertinent real information about history. They teach lessons on being honest, being yourself and doing the right thing. This is a far cry from the Disney genre. Definitely more wholesome - but welcomed for my 9 year old. It turns her American doll into a real person. These are also great to use if your children have any sort of assignment on historical fiction. These remind me of my youth watching Little House. Give them a try - even if you don't have the expensive dolls!"
4,Good Clean Entertainment,I love watching this series in reruns in the 80's when I was a kid. I already own season two so this completes my collection. Good fun for the whole family! Arrived in time as promised. Would suggest making shipping faster for the price charged though.
5,A Good One,If you like the Monkees get this dvd i just got it and like it i just wish the sound was better but its not that bad. the box is a odd size but i like it because i collect dvds and i like the odd ones.i would like to season two out soon.I hope they keep it looking the same way so they look the same.
5,Easy to use,This product is easy to use and yields very nicely minced garlic. Close the twisters loosely--no need to push them tightly closed. Then gently twist without force. Twist until the minced garlic is fine enough for you. And enjoy it!
4,This book was long and slow going.,"I found most of the descriptions of the characteristics of the various classes, based on surveys in France during the 60s and 70s, to be dull. However, many of the insights were surprisingly relevant, decades later and a world away. To me, the postscript, one of the most brilliant essays I've ever read, is more than worth the effort of slogging through the many boring parts that precede it"
3,Droids & Clones,My grandson Loves his two battle packs. As his grandmother I fulfilled his wish but I don't see this toy as educational & I have little idea as to its durability. But he is very happy with it.
2,Too Many Tiny Pieces,"Your kid will think the picture on the box is great and he will attempt to put the toy together. But don't be surprised if he enjoys the droid figures and plays with them apart from the ship. And if you have a dog or crawling babies at home, be careful of all the small pieces which can easily lodge in their throats."
1,Absolutely ridiculous!,"There is no reason why anyone should buy this book, unless one likes poorly drawn stories with ridiculous plots. Of course this is the kind of book people don't really buy for the dialogue...Having that in mind, the pictures have to do the job, which is not the case here. The drawing is primary, not even high-school-sketching-on the back of your notebook quality. We are not even talking about a nave quality which can be very hot, we are talking of BAD artistical skills. To finish if off, the stories are not exciting,in fact you get irritated that you have to flip page after page trying to find something interesting.Buy Belore, buy Noe!"
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"No May Bailey, no Grace Bailey and a substitute Honey. Why did they even bother?This movie is the equivalent of a really bland afterschool special. I bought this dvd based upon how superb the series had been. I wish I had my money back. If you like the ""Wind At My Back"" series then PLEASE don't watch this because there's something missing.....(most of the original cast)."
2,Love the Wind At My Back Series but...,Little disappointed with this DVD as some of the characters weren't in it and one of the main characters has been replaced. Not quite the same!
2,The Devil and Daniel Webster,"This book was not what I wanted or expected. I was looking for the short story. What I got was a play.What I was looking for was a small booklet with just one or 2 short stories in it including ""The Devil and Daniel Webster. I did not want a huge book as I was just going to use the one Benet story in my class. I returned all the copies I purchased and was satisified with the quick action taken. The next time I am looking for something I will check with Amazon again."
4,A great plot! One needs to look for a deeper meaning.,"Cat has a great plot and wonderful action. It was the first of his books that I have read so I can't atest for the content of the novel being Heinlein or not. However I can say that it shows a amusing insight to the behavior of people, and the expectations that we have for one another."
3,Science fiction,"This was the first of Robert Heinlein's books I've read. It was well written but I had trouble following it all the time. I much preferred his ""Door to Summer."" But all in all a good read."
2,"A Good Start, but A Let-Down in the End","The Cat Who Walks Through Walls starts out well. For the first two-thirds of the book it is a sequel to The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress, Heinlein's best post-1960 work. But, in the end, it turns into a sequel to The Number of the Beast, a rather weak book. It would have been nice if Heinlein had resisted the tempation to end the book the way he did."
4,"Excellent, with unexpected twists","I'm frustrated with people who ""liked the book except for the ending"" - although that was also my first take. What everyone is missing is that this is Heinlein's send-up of the classic man-meets-mysterious-woman-and-together-they-save-the-universe space opera (which both Richard and Gwen Hazel wrote!). As for the ending, Heinlein, like his characters, dislikes the Heisenberg/Goedel unknowability implicit in present-day physics, and says there must be something beyond it. Then he makes his point, by leaving Pixel (Schrodinger's cat) and his protagonists in a 50:50 live-or-die situation...and ending the book there. Right, the ending doesn't satisfy; neither, says Heinlein, does contemporary physics. Then see To Sail Beyond The Sunset for what comes next, both for the characters and in science."
4,"Tough going, but worth it","I've been at it for weeks and I'm still not all the way through this one. It's probably the hardest read I've encountered in over 20 poker books I own. The info is there... in GLORIOUS detail, but it's tough getting through it without brain paralysis at some point. They talk about playing all kinds of hands I'd rather just discard, especially in a low-limit game where many other players are loose."
3,James Earl Jones reads the New Testament,I use these CD's to listen to the Bible when I drive - about 1 hour per day. James Earl Jones has a beautiful voice and I chose the KJV because I am the most familiar with it. I find I have to turn the volume up very loud to understand what he is saying. I find I have to concentrate too hard on what he is saying to grasp even the simplest subjects. Perhaps I should have chosen another translation. The narration is great but I am somewhat disappointed.
5,Enjoy the audio bible,"I really enjoy listening to God's word while driving. I keep the case in my car and turn it on everytime i'm in the car. Since i've been listening to the WORD in my car, i am a whole lot less stressed while driving and has noticed that peace carry over into the work place. Nothing but GOD!"
5,Usefull remote option,I purchased this to replace the same after a power surge blew it out. I love this option to set up remote turn on for lamps.
3,Decent,"This works rather well for my needs, though there are a few ways in which it seems cheaply made. The tassels seem to come apart (and the stuffing comes out of them) very easily, and happened not only on mine but on the one I gave as a gift. If you intend to give one as a gift, make sure that you sew some reinforcing stitches on the end of the tassels to keep them closed. I also had to move the ""button"" to which the ring-holder loops, so that the ring holder would be pulled snug and not loose as a wet noodle.Otherwise, the fact that this is silky and has multiple compartments makes it suitable for holding jewelry."
1,zippers poor quality,"(Gold Color)Nice fabric, but offers very little padding/protection for fragile pieces and both zippers broke on the 2nd use."
3,It will work,the item was not as luxurious as I expected. The ring roll is almost flat. The strings must go around too many times.
4,NiMH 1800mAh rechargeable Duracell batteries,The batteries arrived with in a few days and were partially charged. They are used for back up power source for a digital camera and seem to work very well. Duracell seems to be a brand that can be relied on.
5,Great for Game Systems,"I use them exclusively for Xbox 360, Wii controllers, Rock Band Instruments, and TV Remote controls. What can I say? they're batteries... They do the job and have an acceptable amount of time between charges."
2,buyer beware,"It says item ""packaging may vary"" However the product varies too! The package shows 2650 mAh batteries. What you get is the cheaper and weaker 2450 mAh batteries. I complained about it & they offered to refund the shipping charges. I refused that offer and countered with a better which they accepted."
2,Battery power rating is not as advertised,"Nice rechargeable battery but with catch.The product image indicates that the battery power rating is 2650 mAH, but the product I received has the power rating marked as 2450 mAH."
4,Better than disposables,It seems to me that I get more use out of the Duracell rechargeables than the disposable alkalines. In the long run I believe I will save money.
1,review of duracell rechargeable AA batteries,"When I view this item on line it was advertised as duracell rechargeable AA batteries with Duralock even though the photo did not show duralock.The item received does not indicate ""Duralock"" anywhere on the packaging or the product. When I go to the Duracell site their batteries with duralock are clearly marked on the product.I feel that I paid a preminum price for a duralock battery and got Duracell standard battery.Next time I will purchase else where."
5,Love rechargeable s!,We go through a lot of arteries at my house. It seems like everything takes arteries these days. I'm glad to have rechargeable s so I don't have to buy new ones all the time!
1,These are not Z.Z. Hills Greatest Hits - steer clear!!,"The title of this CD is blatant false advertising.These recordings were made for the Malaco label in the 80s, and sound generic, synthesized, dull and have nothing to do with ZZ's greatest achievements, mainly his 60's and early 70's output.Although the singing is great at times, you just can't get that great southern soul feeling when the backup tracks sound like they were played on a 40$ Casio synth.Try and get some of his older stuff instead."
3,It could have been so much better!,"I am a big fan of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and seeing that Patricia Heaton hosted the show is why I bought the DVD ... That being said ... I thought that Patricia Heaton was more of an announcer than a host. She hardly spoke and seemed a little awkward and uninterested - which was surprising for a pro like her!""The Village Idiot"" was quite a disappointment, to say the least. Taylor Mason was refreshing and talented. Michael Jr. was pretty funny. Thor Ramsey was a delight.Overall, this show was a B ... It would have been a lot funnier if the host participated more (like Sinbad does in ""Thou Shalt Laugh 3""). If you are looking for a few good laughs, this DVD will provide that."
2,a little sick,"The last image of a grown man in his near to dead mother's lap is more than a little disturbing. Gets an E for effort. I know what they were trying to do, but really, it comes off as a bit disturbing, Oedipal even."
3,An interesting rummage thru a medievalist's clutter drawer,"When we think of the Middle Ages, we often tend to think of them in terms of cathedrals, crusades, inquisitions, and plague. But common sense tells us on further reflection that of course there was plenty of ordinary getting along in life, too. This book is a miscellany of everyday items and institutions that were invented or came into widespread use during the Middle Ages.Professor Frugoni provides details of many gorgeous medieval illustrations, showing things like eyeglasses, forks, and clocks. She also quotes at length from manuscripts for the same purpose. We flit from one invention to the next, in no seeming order--not that any is really needed--and get a brief explanation of where it came from, when experts think it came into use, and some enjoyable examples, both written and pictorial. A very handsome coffee table book and an interesting few days' browse, too."
3,"Does the job, but ...","This does the job, but there are 3 weaknesses to the switch, IMO:1. the adhesive strips on the back won't hold it to a painted wall,2. the switches are 'on' to the left and 'off' to the right, and3. the battery falls out when it falls off the wall, so you have to reprogram it."
1,Good luck!,"With X10 products you need some measure of luck. When they work, they are excellent. Change what's plugged in near the transmitter or receiver, it might stop working. These switches worked pretty well the first day but not after that. In the future I might use it in a different way and with luck, it will work.Update: It works now."
2,I didn't get it,Making your relationships better by not working on them?? The emperor has no clothes. I read and re-read the keys to self improvement without effort. I enjoyed the seminar discussions but didn't find the information applicable or practical. I much preferred the Five Languages of Love by Gary Chapman. Both books came as a special set from Amazon. I can recommend that book.
3,"small, plastic, light -- do you really know how high 39 inches is?","This is a good tripod. However, I didn't appreciate how small it really is. I cannot use it without kneeling down."
5,Sony Tripod,I was very happy to find this tripod on amazon at $30 cheaper than the Sony Website. I'm not a professional photographer/videographer so this works great for my uses. Easy to set up and compact.
1,The Perfect Height?...,"...Only if you're a smurf. It's too short to practically operate standing up, and very unstable. I get less camera shake holding it in my hand. It's basically useless."
4,Sturdy funcional Tripod,"PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS (as hate large reviews)- Very sturdy!- Super lightweight- 39"" (99cm) TALLEST- 14"" (35cm) SHORTEST- Comes with a useful case- Easy to assemble and viceversa- Black elegant design- Perfect for amateurs- Good value- FAST SHIPPING/DELIVER :)Got it if you're starting, is a good buy for it's price and function. Tho keep in mind the hight 39"" (99cm)."
3,It was nice.. until it broke.,"I got this for my tutorial shooting. Granted, i didn't pay for a professional stand, but still.. the center guiding tube (the middle of the tripod) broke off after several uses .. no matter. I'll go buy a professional stand, but still... Kind of disappointing.also, this is rather wobbly. I wouldn't put my Canon Vixia G10 on it..."
3,"Light, but solid and compact legs, the head is not good","Like many other reviewers have said, the construction is solid. It is much lighter than a typical 60 inch tripod, so great for hiking and backpacking. However, the head is not the easiest to use. My chief complaint is that it is a 2 handed operation, and there is not a quick release plate. This means that you have to manually screw your camera on it every time you use it. And you have to fiddle with the tri-axial knobs to adjust your composition, every time you set it up to take pictures.Given the price, it really is not a bad product. But the product itself is just a little too far from being great."
5,Doggy platypus,"This platypus is great fun -- my South African Dalmatain LOVES it.......and it DOES, as claimed, ''improve eye-paw coordination"" !"
3,Choking hazard,"The egg babies are almost a waste of time. My dog, who rarely destroys a toy, had the stuffing out of them in minutes. She loves the toy. But the eggs are so dangerous that I can't leave them out for her to play with, unless I am supervising. If I left them on the floor, there would not only be stuffing everywhere, she would probably choke to death on the material. I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED in this toy."
3,identity confusion,"My dog who has figured out other toy/food puzzles had trouble with this one. She mostly just thought it was a stuffed hedge hog. I had to show her each time where I was stuffing the eggs in to it in order for her to have fun pulling them out. She really loved the Hide-a-Bird puzzleKyjen Hide-A-Bird Puzzle Plush Intercative Dog Toy, Largeand had no confusion about it being a stuffed toy."
3,"Cute, Fuzzy, but miss the mark!","This is a darling little stuffed creature along with the eggs. However, my dog, who's pretty intelligent, cannot get the eggs out of the fish. The opening that the eggs are to fit through is far too small even for human hands. The eggs are great alone cause they squeek and are easy to play fetch with! However, the purpose of challenging the dog to retrieve the eggs from inside the fish has missed its mark totally!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I wouldn't call my bulldog puppy an aggressive chewer, but within a day he managed to chew off one of the legs. He punctured the squeakers in the ""eggs"", so those are now garbage. I loved the idea of this toy and I didn't have very high expectations because they end up chewed and destroyed, but this was just bad. VERY cheaply made. I will not be buying this toy again."
2,Not great,"I have a small dog (15 lbs), and she can't get the eggs out. I can barely get them out myself. The hole is too tight. She does love playing with the eggs by themselves, and the empty hedgehog by itself, but it wasn't worth the cost. She has plenty of other squeaky balls and empty stuffed animals, I wanted something that would keep her busy."
2,Destroyed in a day,"I have a Siberian Husky who is too smart for her own good, and I thought this would be a nice, time consuming thing to keep her occupied. Not the case. She destroyed her adorable platypus in less than an hour. I mean, annihilated this thing. Stuffing everywhere. I am giving this product two stars because for some reason she loves the squeaky eggs. No idea."
2,not for labs :(,"When I saw a platypus toy on Amazon I thought it'd be a great toy for my lab. Unfortunately, it occured that my dog was about to swallow eggs! I was scared and collected eggs and put them into a place where he can't find them. I think that this toy isn't proper for larger dogs with wide muzzles. Instead of eggs I stuffed this platyfus with dog treats and then my lab was extremely happy to find some food in it. However, it is not the aim of this toy that's why I'm dissapointed."
5,good for dogs that are not extreme chewers,"I had a malteese/yorkie cross, He loved the hedgehog and played with it for a couple of years before he chewed it up. We now have a Schnauser/poodle cross. He ate the nose off and ate the stuffing out of the head in under an hour of getting the toy!"
3,Great for awhile,"My little miniature Labradoodle loved this toy and caught on right away how to get the ""eggs"" out. Unfortunately she also after about a week got all the stuffing out the of toy. However, she still loves and plays with the ""eggs"".I call them potatoes. She will run around with them, and since they are not really round, they bounce around when she drops them. She will chase them for hours. You do get five with the toy. As she destroys each one I give her another. But when all five eggs are gone I will not be buying this toy again."
3,hard for my pup to get the eggs out.,"I think this is a great toy with a great concept. My dog, however had a hard time getting the eggs out. I think the hole is just too small. It might be easier for big dogs to use, I have a Yorkie. He does love the platy. He rough houses with it as if it were another pup, so that's a big plus. If you have a small dog, the squirrels in a tree is good, in combination with the eggs from this toy. I wish my dog was good enough to get the eggs out, cause this is a great toy."
3,First arrived damaged,"The first platypus arrived damaged (the paw was split at the sides), so I returned it. My foster dog wasn't interested in playing with it at all, but my children loved it. I'm going to be sending this to a friend to use for her dogs as I'm not longer fostering dogs, hopefully they'll get some use out of it. The price was right when I bought it though, so I'm not too upset about it."
4,Plush Duckie,"My dog just loves it. She goes nuts over the squeakers. The only set back is there is nothing to hold the ""eggs"" in the duck cause you have to use 2 at a time. Other than that plush toys are really good a durable."
2,Stuffing comes out too easily,"My dog liked this, but tore it apart way too quickly. Not only do the ""eggs"" come apart really easily, but when they are out of the turtle, stuffing within the turtle is exposed (in other words, you can feel the stuffing loose inside the turtle--it's not sewn in). Not a durable toy at all."
2,Destroyed in 5 minutes!,"I thought this would be a great toy for my 33lb dog, but after about 5 minutes he not only had the eggs out, but he pulled out all the stuffing & squeakers out of all 3 eggs. In another 5 minutes, he had the stuffed toy ripped apart & was pulling the stuffing out of that also! Definately not for chewers!"
3,Cute but smaller than it looks,I thought it would be bigger and the extra eggs is great. My dog would chew up the things inside and then there was nothing left to the toy that was fun to her. Now she can enjoy playing with this and I can refill with the extra eggs provided to make it last longer.
2,It's ok,My lab does not try to take the squeaky balls out he just likes to play with the animal itself and carry it around. It's not a very big toy I was honestly expecting bigger but its small/medium sized. I have tried to encourage my lab to play with it and take the squeaky balls out but he could care less.
4,Quick and Easy,"Shipping was very quick and simple hassle. I ordered this for my boss because it's cheaper than going to Staples or Office Depot, even with the shipping and handling! No problems, no hang-ups!"
3,and why was this a prize winner?,"Somehow the reader just doesn't care about the individual characters portrayed in this novel (though the census ""facts"" make you wonder if it's non-fiction!). It is only after-the-fact, in retrospect, that the people come more to life. Perhaps I'm in my own little world, and the subject matter is far from my life's experiences. The quoted conversations just didn't ring true to me."
3,Recommend--My Assigned Reading,"I was assigned to read The Known World for a college literature class not knowing anything about the read. Upon reading the first few chapters, my mind began to wander trying to keep each new character separate from the next. Though other reviews say Jones's big downfall is the extensive list of characters, I would disagree. The book, tough to read without discussion, was unique; the sentences though not always flowing and clear, set the reader up for flashbacks while brief mentions of new characters allowed the further readings to connect. I would recommend The Known World, along with close reading and the paperback version with an attached Read On that contains a character list for reference."
2,The Known World,"Although I appreciate Mr. Jones' efforts in his novel, ""The Known World"" I found the book to be disjointed and confusing. I felt he had too many characters and the lack of a linear storyline didn't help matters. One of my friends, with whom I have an on-line book club with, suggested that Mr. Jones could have done a series as opposed to a single novel. We were particularly interested in the female characters; perhaps focusing on a smaller group of people, such as Fern Elston and her students, would have been more interesting. I thought the story premise was excellent, but we never did learn why Henry bought slaves, after having been one himself, or what he thought about it. Mr. Jones is an excellent writer with vivid character portrayals, but much got lost in the translation. This novel could have been so much more and it wasn't."
2,Disappointed,"After reading such rave reviews, I found that I was totally disappointed. The only interesting fact was that black people also owned slaves.I found it very hard to find and keep up with a storyline. There was too much jumping back and forth in time from different characters."
3,Book Club selection,This was a book club selection in the pulitzer prize catagory. It was well received by the members and there was a lengthy discussion on the content. The great thing about book clubs is you will read a book that you normally wouldn't pick up and find you really enjoyed reading it. This was one of those books. It was an education for all.
2,Just because slaves had bad English doesn't mean they can't think,"I actually have not finished this book, but I believe I am going to give up. I've read about 150 pages, and really am not curious about what happens to any of the people. The characters don't have much depth. The author has them act like he makes them speak English--poorly and incompletely--a bit puzzling. As a historical novel set in the time of slavery, I think it may have some value, as the life of some slaves is probably depicted fairly accurately. But people come and go and you don't get to know them in depth at all. If I feel that I should revise this review in case curiosity wins out, I will. I really think there are many more engaging novels out there."
2,Not That Good,"There were some interesting facts about slavery and it was a good premise for a book. However, there were way too many characters and since they were not fleshed out it became confusing as to who was who. Would not recommend."
3,The Known World,"At first, I had trouble understanding this book, because the large amount of characters, and the organization of the story, but as I advanced throughout the chapters, my understanding of it became clearler.Overall, I enjoyed the reading of The Known World, I really got involve with Henry, and all the trouble that he went through out his life to become what he learned so well as he grew up, to be a master. I don't think it is wrong for him to dream about that and actually become one, after all, that's what he learned all along while living under Robbins' protection (ownership). I see Herny as a ambitious man, that happen to be black, and in his journey to succeess, he took the choices he thought might bring to him what he has been dreaming all these years while he was slave."
3,"Fascinating Story, Stylistic Issues","Jones tackled a subject that most people would be reticent to address: Blacks owning black slaves before the Civil War. The story of Henry Townsend and his family and property was compelling and heart-wrenching. However, anytime one of the minor characters was mentioned, Jones would remind you of his/her background. I found the repetition tiring. But I applaud the courage it took to write this book."
4,Very good but don't expect it to be easy,"I really enjoyed this book. I had a hard time with his writing style at first but found it easier as the story went along. I felt this was a wonderfully challenging book. So much I did not know about the 1800's. I would tell anyone to read it and give it a chance. By the end of the book you will be flying through the pages. However, this book took more time for me to read than almost anyother book I have read!Enjoy."
3,I like the song but the bppk is a waste of money,"I really liked the song, and i would sing it along with my duaghter, but this e-book was a waste of my money unfortunatly!"
5,No more jumping on the bed,One of my daughter's favorite. Her playdates all like the book too. They like to say it with me. No more jumping on the bed.I highly recomend because kids will see how the monkeys get hurt and cry with the booboos. Keila is 27 months old
2,The title is misleading....,"If your looking to ""win People Over"" then you need to invest in NLP persuasion based books. I have had this book for a while and it just sits on my shelf and i almost never pick it up."
1,pee-wee was that you bertie?,the book was half english half spanishwe don't speak spanishthis book is useless to us
5,Amazing,"This man has done wonderful things with his amazing talent to create not only beautiful music, but faith affirming worship within these songs. The lack of lyrics leave room for an imagination of finding what each song means to you and creating your own lyrics to it in your head. Lyrics that dictate how the music makes you feel and how it can change your life. Every single one of David Nevue's albums, Overcome, Whisperings, Adoration, A Delicate Joy, Revelations, Sweet Dreams & Starlight, Awakenings, O Come Emmanuel and While The Trees Sleep have done nothing short of change my life. The lull me to sleep, they keep me focused to study, they calm my fears, sooth my frustration and elate my praise and happiness. To listen to David Nevue play piano, is to listen to the Soundtrack of Heaven, if there ever were one. He is and will live on to be, my favorite and most loved musician and pianist."
4,Quiet,The unit runs very quietly. It was easy to install and my plumbersaid it was a good value- from his experience. Hopefully the servicelife will be long and event free.
1,Term and condition,"Term and conditionThis product has ""6 Year We Come To You In Home Parts & Labor Service Warranty"". Does someone see ""term and condition"" of these service? Some phone number? How many days do you need waiting to fix your problem? Answer is only ""NO"". It is trick."
4,Product Great So Far...,Product is great so far. It is very quiet for a garbage disposal. The only reason why I didnt give 5 stars is that I had not expect it to be big. It took up a good bit of space under my sink cabinet. So make sure you measure your sink cabinet space before purchasing the product.
2,Reading this book on a Kindle was problematic,"I love reading books on my Kindle Fire. This is the first book where the Kindle format proved problematic. To follow the details of the fire, you really need the large illustration of the circus tent in the book.In addition, this is unfair but I recently finished reading The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration by Isabel Wilkerson. That book follows and tells the stories of three people and their families. In Circus Fire, O'Nan tries to weave in the stories of so many survivors of the fire that it gets confusing."
5,Almost a novel,"Well-written and impossible to put down. It is a true story and the book is a history; however, it reads like a novel. I especially liked the addition of what happened to the survivors years later."
4,Good book on fundamental analysis...,"Don't be put off by the rather cheesy title. This is a very good book on fundamental analysis. The author has a very readable style, assumes no prior knowledge of accounting or ability to read financial statements. The only pre-requisite is a healthy dose of common sense.The book is very readable and very suitable for a beginning investor. Intermediate investors will find much of the material familiar, but will find some new things to pick up.The only negatives I can find about the book is that it is somewhat disorganized. I also would have preferred the author focus solely on Value Investing (and make the treatment more complete by discussing and building discounted cashflow models)."
4,"Not much archaeology, lots of sorrow","Martin's characters take the reader into small town life in Cortez, where their destinies wind and unwind. The story steps carefully from past to present, revealing Sarah's own sense of being buried, just like the Anasazi girl whose skeleton she has found in the ruins. Her road trip with Tom John is the best part of the book, the archetypal journey to self. Sarah's sorrow (MS), her husband's sorrow (his affair), Tom John's sorrow (he's getting up there in years), Oma's sorrow (not being able to stay in her home), Sarah's family's sorrow all reflect off each other like sparkling shards of some shattered mirror. Everybody has to be somewhere, and as a reader, I'm glad the characters of this story are here in my neck of the woods--the Four Corners, Mancos, Cortez, Lewis-Arriola."
5,Ready to experience the road in Spain,"Very good atlas, even found my friend's village high above the Ebro."
2,boring,"The book is narated in a rather monotone, unethusiastic manner. It seems to be filled with Colin just narrating a chronological list of things he did with no insight into what these things meant or why he did them."
4,Excellent,An excellent read that gives good insights to the person and the soldier Colin Powell.There are plenty of good stories about Powell himself as well as the people he has served and those who have served him. It gives an insight into a person who (already at the time of the book) has had a tremendous impact on the Armed Forces as well as American polictics in generel.We can only hope that there will be a sequal.
5,Deep Thoughts,Great to hear that true values are still an element out there to guide us. Colin Powell has clear concepts to share.
1,Thumbs Down,"Did not receive my order of Fundamental Concepts and Skills for Nursing from sackingsfan 851, but this person got my money. What a rip-off."
5,No other nail gun is even close!,I am a roofing contractor. I have tried a few other brands of nail guns but none can come close to the quality and durability of the Hitatchi! There is nothing else to say. You can not beat this gun. It won't dissapoint you!
1,"Please ......look away! , look away !","No don't even look at this. If you are thinking about buying this i wish you the best of ""luck"" while you go on an adventure that will change your life 4ever.Leprechaun is pretty well ok movie, it trys to scare you. The rest of the movies are just pieces of crap. It goes from Crap 2 The biggest piece of crap you will ever witness in your life.C'mon a Leprechaun in space. Now, if that isn't stupid i don't know what is, and how he gets there still amazes me. How does he get in the space shuttle? A space Marine pisses on his leg, which from that piss travels into the marine and later pops out of his crotch during intercourse. Wow!!! i'll just leave it at that . WOW!!!!!"
3,Alright movies,"I sold this set and then purchased them again within a few years. I really enjoyed the one set in space, even though people consider it the worst film of all time. The only parts I liked in the set was part 3 and 4. The first two some consider a classic but I cant really remember them too all. The one where he goes to the hood was bad and probably the worst dvd of the set. Still a good buy because if you buy 1,2,3,and 4 they might cost you the same price of the boxset."
3,Great Way to Collect the Series!,"The first five leprechaun movies are all here in one solid set, ready for you to collect. There is a sixth movie, leprechaun back to the hood, that you would have to buy seperatley to collect ALL the leprechaun movies. There is really nothing special about this set to make it shine as something remarkable. It is just a box with the first 5 DVD movies. The movies don't really have any special features other than one or two have the trailers. This box set is just a way to collect the fist five movies in the series and is a really great way to do so. Even if you don't like these movies, no one can deny how cool the box set looks just sitting there. Look at that beautiful green face!!"
5,A Powerful book from the next generation of revolutionary poets,"In the legacy of the greats like Amiri Baraka this book stings with purity and passion. Truly African in its subtext, amazing in its delivery. A refreshing book from an often silent generation of African-Americans. The intelligence behind this book gives our nation hope that the next mental genius are on the rise and fully articulating a new reality for humanity."
4,The Ties That Bind (Arabesque),Great timeliness of order and mail to my home. Book was in good condition.
3,"Bad acting, but...","This movie had some terrible acting but managed to keep me in suspense until the end. There were actually some humorous parts in it, although I didn't know if they were intended to be funny. There's some blood, but not too gory. Worth watching, in my opinion, just don't expect much."
4,Scary...,"Whoa! This book is SCARY. When I say scary, I mean scary. Don't get this book if you don't like scary stuff. Then only thing is that if you don't get it, MAN, you're gonna want it! Okay, okay, maybe I'm exaggerating. Maybe it's only a little scary. Still, get it."
2,Not the worst sound ive heard,"Cliche stuff, sounds the same as alot of other stuff out there, only decent song is What u Got? The version with Mr Cold guy, cant think of his name right off hand. They're definitely no Rage Against the Machine, not even close. And i dont even like RATM all that much either. Fairly disposable, much like the rest of the music industry. CDs i would recommend: Cold:Cold; Fireball Ministry:The 2nd Great Awakening; Queens of the Stone Age: Self Titled..... These 3 albums are very underrated, throw your reveille back into the dusty box"
1,Worthless rap-metal trash.,"About as awesome as Saliva's first album, and about as genuine. Not a single bit of originality. Mixed some emo in, which we all love about as much as a root canal. Pathetic, droning crap which isn't worthy of the garbage compactor you will throw it in after listening."
3,Anthologies,"Sometimes anthologies are just too short. In the case of Lora Leigh's Reno's Chance, this would definitely be the case. Not nearly enough storyline for the two characters to develop their relationship or give background into the Tempting SEAL series. I was a bit disappointed and felt like this story was an afterthought that never really came to fruition."
3,Interesting to say the least,WANTED: ONE HOT-BLOODED MAN by Pamela Britton - I was unimpressed with this story. I think it should come with a health warning for the unprepared - there is a fairly lurid lesbian scene which I did not appreciate reading. I understood that the person was confused and had been raped. However that was just taking things way too far.I also did not appreciate the way that the first two authors kept on using lewd references to female body parts.Read the last two stories they are well worth it. The first two should be consigned to the bin!
3,"Yay, John Femia","The only reason I bought this video is because of John Femia (he played Tony), of whom I am a great fan. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film is otherwise. It certainly kept my attention all the way through, although it was heartbreaking at times. All in all a good movie, certainly worth watching."
2,"Light, but no power","The gun is easy to handle and gets into tight spots, but does not have to power to drive and set a 3"" nail."
3,Average,"Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach (Fourth Edition) by Hill and Jones is used in my BUS 499 Business Strategy class at Hannibal-LaGrange College. I would consider this book to be about average. It has many charts and graphs which I find to be helpful. I believe a better job could have been done when explaining difficult material. The Closing Cases help relate a ""real world"" aspect to the material."
3,Not too bad,"I am currently a student at Hannibal LaGrange College and we are using ""Strategic Management Theory"" in my Business Strategy course. This text is easier to understand than other texts because key terms are in bold lettering and their definitions are easy to follow. The only part I don't like is the graphs and charts. Some of the graphs are hard to understand which makes the material seem more difficult than it is. Also, the coloring used on the graphs make them hard to read. All in all, this text is appropriate for a course like this."
3,sometimes confusing for me...,"This book is used as our text in my senior level business strategy class. I found the book easy to read. However, understanding for me did not come as easily. Concepts discussed were vague. Although they were well defined, their relationships were not as obvious. The graphs that were provided did not help me to understand some of the ideas. However, the charts were good at putting the ideas and different classifications together."
4,great,This shower comb works wonderfully with my natural hair. Has a nice grip while wet and the waves helps to detangle hair more. I found this product actually rips out lesser hair then the denman brush while in the shower. Highly recommend!
2,knots,I thought this product would be good for me - I have hair below my shoulders and get knots frequently. this product is cheap plastic with rough edges. I would not recommend.
1,you get what you pay for,The Winsome Wood Shelf is cheaply made and serviceable but the lack of quality control is obvious in the gaps and ill fitting parts which cannot be easily overcome by even the most expert construction. Not something I would purchase again. I'd have done better for the money at a thrift store.
3,What I expected,pretty nice I guess - I cannot remember how much I paid for this - it is used for a unseen bedside table - so not a big deal
2,Great Music,"Great music but one of the paper lables were used on the cd and made it worthless to me,as will not play."
3,no stability control,only if you have perfectly neutral step would these be good for you. pronation at any level will make these uncomfortable for running. they look exactly like the picture and are nice and light with nice ventilation.
2,Didnt Fit,"Buying shoes through the internet, unless you already know the size of your foot and that that specific shoe will fit you, is really a waste of time. These were too tight for my foot and I didnt wear them much."
1,Should not be called a backpack,"Not sure if it is really Prada...it is way too small; even for a child that is 10. I got it for pre-tween, and it's like a little pouch. You can't even wear it on your back like a normal backpack...the straps/handles are not like a regular backpack. If you are looking for something for school or even to walk around the mall with, this is NOT it."
4,It is what it is...,"Excellent cast in a movie that reflects life - sometimes humourous, sometimes disappointing, sometimes sad and sometimes strange.Although Elle MacPherson cannot act, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ben Stiller and Eric Schaeffer are convincing enough to take up the slack.I agree with one of the other reviewers in that this is a consistently funny and touching film."
5,Eric Shaeffer is a hidden genius.,"You have probably never heard of it before, but this movie was certainly a sleeper hit. While supporting himself as a cab driver in NYC, Eric Shaeffer wrote this film. Starring himself, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Elle MacPherson, it is the story of 2 best friends, Joe and Lucy, who are both going nowhere with their love lives. They made a pact in college that if neither had found their soulmate and gotten married by Lucy's 30th birthday they would jump off the Brooklyn Bridge together. The big 3-0 for Lucy is right around the corner, so it's time for them to both get on the ball. They set out to find their special someone and hilarity follows. The soundtrack is provided by Marry Me Jane and makes for a wonderful backdrop. An absolute must-see."
4,Great Product!,This one one of my most favorite toys from when I was 6 years old to now. It's lot's of fun to play with.
4,Heart breaking,This book is hard to read due to the amount of detail but it is the detail that truly opens your eyes to these horrible acts of man.
4,Different view,"Very enlighting....It gives the reader another side to look from, some one who had no clue what was happening. Ms Olga makes you understand why the Jews walked to their deaths without a cry for help,a show of force,or just stop doing anything....but its hard for her to answer the question, ""How can someone be so mean and hate someone so bad to do the things they did."" I would like to read something written by a German at one of the camps to give his/her point on the camps....."
2,Depressing,"Auschwitz stories are always depressing, but this one is very dry, so it was hard to get involved as I would have liked to with the characters."
5,The Undiscovered Star Trek,"Watching the TAS DVDs was like watching a long-lost Star Trek series. Rarely do I have a chance to discover Star Trek episodes I've never seen. I was very skeptical about TAS, but I was surprised to discover a thoughtful and creative series. More importantly, the voice performances of the TOS cast makes this series an authentic extension of the Star Trek Universe. It's great that the stepchild of the Star Trek franchise which few people have seen now has a spot in every Trekker's collection."
5,dr spock?,"Just one sentence, look in the liner notes of this STAS and instead of Mr Spock, it is written as Dr Spock, the child psychiatrist.I often thought it was Dr Spock when I was a young lad, to find it is Mr Spock.Enjoy... :)"
2,Not what I was expecting,"I like watching Star Trek with my Trekkie boyfriend and I thought that this would be a great gift for his birthday. When we watched it I fell asleep on the couch because of boredom. He seemed to enjoy it, but I haven't figured out whether it is out of politeness or if he meant it. He doesn't ask me to watch it with him and I haven't seen him watch it since that night.So basically, I'm disapointed. The animation is great, considering when it was made, and the characters from the original series did the voice-overs. But it's just not the same as watching the ""real"" Captain Kirk navigate through space....Dare to NOT boldy go where I went with this DVD. Unless you'd like to just have it collect dust on your DVD shelf..."
2,Some good episodes but overall not so good,"I think people giving this set 4 stars is more for nostalgic value than anything else. For years I thought of these (in my mind) as great episodes because I remember them that way from childhood than I obtained a VHS copy and they weren't exactly good. You can tell they did these on a shoestring budget, James Doohan does almost every voice on the show and the animation is so so. Buy it if you are a die hard Trekker but I dont think many kids would have interest in these today."
4,Set up a pain... pay off great,"I got this as a way to monitor my children while they are in their room without having to sit at their doorway all the time. Granted you can't see every hair on their head, you can see enough to keep them safe.I have a Belkin router so it was a pain to set this up, but after six hours on the phone with their tech support from India I finally got it working without them."
4,Works great for most purposes; can't see detail,"I use this to keep an eye on my dogs who stay in our downstairs hallway during the day. The camera's resolution is indeed low, but I can see my whole hallway illuminated with only 3 75 Watt recessed ceiling lights, and I can see that both my dogs are there and whether they are sleeping, playing or eating. The camera was super easy to set up and has given me zero problems. It picks up my wireless router that is two whole stories up with no problem. It works fine with IE6 or IE7, which is all I use. If you need to see detail like the expression on a person's face, this won't do it. But for most purposes it is just fine!"
1,Linksys wireless webcam,First off it was very hard to figure out how to operate it. Then when you try to view it from a different computer or location..you cant... The website that controld the remote viewing capability has been shut down. Why even but this?
1,HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"Spent many hours trying to set this thing up. Tech support is a joke. They are clueless. The problem is that the software version being sent with the camera is an old version that barely works--and they have no updated version. After many hours of talking with tech support, product did not work as advertised. Amazon should drop carrying this item. Spend the extra 50 bucks and get a camera that works."
1,"Difficult to use, poor quality","We used this camera a few times, but it's not really wireless (needs to be plugged into a router) and it does not work well for motion detection.It is very difficult to set up.It has poor picture quality."
1,No Vista Support,Unlike many people writing reviews of the product I haven't even been able to install the software as it doesn't support Windows Vista.
2,Needs improvement,"On one hand, this was very easy to set up and use. But there are major deficiencies. The built-in web server is a bit flakey causing it to appear ""off"" sometimes, then mysteriously coming back. It also doesn't seem to work with Firefox, only IE. I haven't tried other browsers. The client program is somewhat useful, especially the motion activated record feature.The camera itself is woefully insensitive under normal room lighting conditions. Daylight outdoors is fine. But under low or normal room light (i.e. at night) images are very dark compared to other very cheap web cameras I have. Outdoors at night with a spotlight it is completely unusable. At this price I would not buy it again, or recommend it unless it were improved."
2,If it only did what it said it can do..........,"It sounded so easy.....The installation was not as plug and play as you would hope.It located the cam perfectly when the ethernet wire is plugged in.But according to the instructions, you remove the cable and power down and power up the cam and its now ""wireless"".Not sure what the issue is but mine never would locate. I think there are so many variables that could be in error...ports, DCHP vs Static IP, and on and on. None of which are clear in the CD installation.After reading the many reviews of others having the same issue, I decided that i didn't want to spend hours on the tech support line (just hearing it is in India is enough to make me not even call.)I'm returning this item and saving me some grief. I'm usually more ambitious, ready for an installation puzzle, but this is too much.On another note, even with the wire plugged in, the picture quality and frame rate was kinda sad."
2,Only ActiveX? Are you kidding?,"Linksys seems to be living in the last decade. This camera can only be observed remotely with an ActiveX capable browser, in other words, Internet Explorer.What this means: NO Macintosh, NO Firefox, NO Flock...To make it worse, the ActiveX control has an expired certificate, which means you can't install it without tweaking the default security settings in the browser.Come on Linksys, you can do better!!!! How about Flash based video, or quicktime, or Windows Media Video? ActiveX is a thing of the past."
2,Barely does the job,I bought this cam to be a nursery cam. I have it mounted over the crib looking down directly into the crib. As was mentioned previously the picture is not great and you do need a lot of light which means as a night time nursery cam it is worthless. No audio of course. I have a separate nursery monitor for that. It does not work with Vista. I have read where the WVC200 software when loaded on a Vista machine will work with this camera but I haven't tried it yet. I think it is a great idea but all in all the cam is just a hair above worthless.
2,poor image poor features,This poor camera needs very bright light to see anything.The software features are almost universally despised. A simple operation like embedding a snapshot into your own web page is not possible. The recorder software doesn't work on Vista. Not compatible with most web cam programs.
3,Why the 10 Commandments Matter,"*** Not since Moses brought the Ten Commandments off the mountain have they been so much in the headlines, or so it seems at times. Many people are making a stand for the right to display them in public, but are they also willing to display them in their lives? Does it matter whether or not they do either? Exactly what are the Ten Commandments? Examing what the Decalouge entails at more than face value, Dr. Kennedy explains what they mean in practical terms so that everyone who cares about living out their faith can display the Commandments in their day to day life. ***"
1,riped off,"The set of 39 books i recieved had 6 books that were double,making the set 6 books short. I am extreamlydisapointed sincerly yoursrichard giomi"
2,watch out for quality here,"When I first got this sander a year ago,1. first thing the conveyer belt fell off and tore itself to pieces.2. 220 grit sand paper just doesn't stay in place on this sander's drum. Just today, 2 wraps of new 220 grit paper self destructed. The clamps just don't hold.3. I can never get hold of performax (WMH? tool group) for any technical assistance. It's one of those ""I am either on the phone with another customer or away from my desk"" but they never seem to come back.4. The sand paper is expensive especially in precut rolls so I am going to get bulk rolls so losing a wrap is not so painful.5. The alignment of the drum to the coveyer doesn't stay put very well.6. You can't use just any dust collector to collect the rather fine dust. It plugged up my first one but now I have a cyclone and it is satisfactory.BUT, NOW I am addicted to the wonderful concept of wide sanding (no tear out anymore), so I will keep on trying to get around these problems."
5,Great sander!,I almost never need to sand wide boards so this is the perfect machine. The setup took no time at all and the tracking belt worked fine right off the bat. I can't say how durable it is since I just got it but I'm really happy with it. I wish that I'd bought it a long time ago!
1,Obviously I didn't pay enough attention to the editorial review.,"OK.... to clear things up: This is a DVD w/extras and not a CD-ROM like the Listing titled suggests. You can play it on your home DVD player and also pop it in your DVD-ROM drive and learn the lessons provided.The whole DVD is an interview with the photographer. Nothing more. He does talk about techniques he used to obtain certain shots but all of the shots are stills that are shown on the screen.Obviously I didn't pay enough attention to the editorial review. This DVD is merely a paper book on disc. I already have tons of books. The appeal to me was that I thought I would get to see Bill working in the real world with real models. He did not capitalize on the DVD format. There are no live shots whatsoever of him staging, lighting, posing, or shooting any models. This has been a complete waste of $40."
1,Review of cookies,"In the stores it is $1.98; far too overpriced and didn't realize it. The product is a good product, of course. Thanks."
4,Before you go to China....,This documentary show a segment of tourism in China today. It shows the changing family life and widely divergent cultures of American tourists and the Chinese who are supporting the travel cruises. I travelled with the same ship/crew on the Yangtze and was suprised by how accurately the personalities were shown. This is an excellent look at China's youth and the new capitalism in China.
3,Not bad,"Takes being a little patient with these guys, but once you get used to the bad sound and slow pace, it ain't bad. They're really funny."
2,Disappointed,"I watched pieces of it on youtube before purchasing it, and they were very funny! When we watched the dvd that i gave to my dad for a Christmas present, we were all disappointed. those were the only funny parts! the video quality was pretty poor, and it was very short. not to mention, the meal they cooked was nothing special and they didnt even explain well how to cook it. they did seem like they loved what they do, but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, which is upsetting!"
3,Good read,"Being a musician, I was interested in what the author had to say about my profession. Most all of what she tells us is true. Musicians are just people like anyone else. They just have over inflated egos that help get them through the horrible business of music so that they can get to the joy of making the music. I never got the feeling that the author loved making music and was just obsessed with the business part. But then, she was in New York where there is little joy for musicians because the business overshadows the joy of just making music."
2,Screwing around with reeds,"This is at first easy to read & quite amusing. After a while one notices the lack of logic in the clunky sensationalist prose - and quite a few clinkers like ""Schubert's Manfred overture"" which make one wonder how many of the other details are bogus too. The sex 'n drugs are also not very inspiring, but some of the sleazy stuff about living conditions etc rings true (for a non-American in Europe...)"
1,Bed and Tell Memoir,"Celebrity memoirists, all their books are bed and tell,These ladies love to list the men who've fallen to their spell!The princes and the counts whom they can count among their exes,The notches they've collected in the duel between the sexes.And now they all are publishing, these voluble ex-lovers,And what was once between the sheets is now between two covers!One can't just own a spiffy car, one also has to drive it,One has to show off publicly what once was strictly private.These literary ladies all unbounded and uncaged,List youthful improprieties, though now they're middle-aged.When Mother Time has let you down and left you uninspired,At least let total strangers know that you were once desired.Hemmed in by dull propriety, a woman has to flout it,So spend your youth with gorgeous men - then tell the world about it!"
5,A must have,"This book takes you from start to finish of a full body Thai massage routine. The descriptions and pictures are very detailed and easy to understand. This book gives all the information from the setting of the room to contraindications for the novice or experienced practicioner. He also gives the tradition and a knowledge of Thai culture. I have recently been to Thailand to study massage, it has changed my bodywork practice for the better ( I'm a massage therapist/ yoga teacher) and it is because of this book and its author."
5,a better supergirl,This story finally takes supergirl out of the shadows of superman. she isnt his neice or some lame thing like that she is her own character and it comes out great. The story line is really dark and also deals with Linda danvers not just Supergirl. The artwork is also amazing Gary Frank's drawing are amazing.
1,Not one of David's better comic book stories,"Supergirl has always been a second-rate DC character. When the orignal Supergirl died in Crises on Infinite Earths, it was a merciful way to put that character out to pasture. This new Supergirl is not any better, just a variation of the same character,with somewhat different origins. Why Peter David is writing this....I don't know but he can certainly work on more interesting comic book heroes then this."
3,ordered 2 units and 1 broke in the first 2 days,For a product that's supposed to be used everyday I wasn't impressed that one broke so fast.
1,Not as in picture,"Mine had a plastic knob, same part number. It was stripped doing a hard caliper piston. I had a hard time to remove it from caliper after that."
2,No ceramic,"The set was advertised as ""Ceramic"" . Well, after a few months the ""ceramic"" peeled off in all the items and was left with metal, hopefully stainless.The item itself is not bad .. brush does its work and the razor is as good as all Mach are. But, I am bothered about the misleading advertising."
4,About bad taste isn't the same as in bad taste,"I bought this album when it was only available as a British import only because no American company had the balls to release it. Not as startling today, but remember that this was released in the days of Journey, Styx and Toto. Makes its point with gigantic exclamation marks. No subtlety here."
5,nothing better,"This album changed my outlook on the world, and reminds me every time I listen to it that questioning what you're told is never wrong. Unfortunately, Jello's bandmates have decided to talk trash about him, calling him a terrorist due to his views despite the fact that the Dead Kennedys would never have existed or been noticed if it weren't for his provacative lyrics. Buy this album and find out what punk rock is really about."
1,Alternative Tentacles,Manifesto is a terrible record label. It is a great cd if you get it on Alternative Tenacles.
5,One of the best,"I haven't listened to the CD version, but my old vinyl is just about worn out. I have to agree with another reviewer who mentioned that one of his favorites, ""Police Truck"" is not on the CD. That's a disappointment. It was on the vinyl, and is a classic. Listening to East Bay Ray power chord through so many songs is worth the price. From top to bottom, one of the ten albums I'd take with me if stranded on an island!"
5,This is the greatest punk rock CD EVER recorded.,"These guys were truly a great band. It's too bad that the rest of the band hates Jello now. I probably would go see them in concert. It would be SO AWESOME to hear California Uber Alles and Chemical Warfare live. Jello has such a weird voice, and it really adds to the effect of this strangely, yet well put together rock masterpiece. The lyrics are incredibly intelligent, and thought provoking. This album perfectly fits the political situation of it's time. I swear, this IS the best punk rock CD ever recorded. Definately reccomended.If you like this, you'll also like:CrassSubhumansEarlier Anti-FlagBad ReligionPennywise"
4,West Coast Punk 1980,"Dk Rules. This is one of there best. The album features many classics such as California Uberallas,Holiday In Cambodia,and my all time favorite of DK Drug Me. Great Californian Political Punk. Jello Biafra rules."
3,Really not that Bad!,"I've not read the book yet but the movie isn't that bad, especially the actress who played the main charater Rebecca, she's really working hard to interprate the original narrator of the novel, she looks pretty and innocent, yet intelligent, I will definitely read the book later if I have time...."
2,MOTH DIARIES IS MEDIOCRE,"THE MOTH DIARIES looks nice, creating Gothic atmosphere in a modern setting. Ultimately, though, it's a hollow and uninspired film. Is Ernessa a true vampire or does Rebecca create her fears to eradicate herself over guilt she feels from her father's tragic death? The movie's failure to support either scenario results in an uneven film resulting in a disappointing conclusion.The cast does well, but the romantic subplot with Rebecca and the handsome professor has no real impact on the film. MOTH DIARIES is another example of style over substance."
4,What I've been waiting for,My games usually have a large scale conflict between kingdoms as the backdrop for the players. The moment I held this book in my hands in the local book store I knew I wanted it. It is essential for any DM that will be working with large scale conflicts. I found it quite fun in the following few weeks to gather my group around a tactical map of the area and plan out which units will be moving where and what will be the best defense against the enemy hordes...
5,An Eye-Opener,"His later books have refined and expanded upon these themes, but The Selfish Gene remains a pivotal point in Dawkins's highly accessible exploration of the nature of our existence. With the battle for pure science raging in American schools, readable works like this might become the best chance for opening up the wonderful world of evolutionary science to everyone. Read The Selfish Gene if you haven't yet, or re-read it if you have."
2,A book that explains everything wierd,THe book is wierd... it explains a lot of nonsense things and he does not knoe how to write a book.. He talks to much about examples and it takes him 10 pages to get to his points. I disagree with a lot of stuff he says in this book. i dont think selfish is something we born with. we learned to be selfish. Dont buy this book!! Just borrow it from your friends or the library.
1,Worst movie,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad acting. Rampant cliches. Crazy logical inconsistencies. Moronic storyline. Annoying music. Really bad acting. This movie puts the horror in horrible.The actors are relatively good-looking, though."
2,Trying to be Conan Doylish?,"This is one lousy attempt at recreating a post-Victorian ambience. The formula is taken straight out of a Doyle mystery novel - the dark and stormy night, the mysteriuos package, the anonymous notes. And then you get b-list American actors trying to act serious and menacing and sophisticated. For the record, kids from different socioeconomic levels usually don't mingle. Rich kids don't invite poor kids to their estates."
4,a lot of fun,I am just sorry that the series is no longer available at stores that they discontinued it altogether and now wehave to be paying much more if we find it on ebay and on ebay it is usually used item
1,"Too much opinion, too little description of what happened","Extremely disappointing. I bought this book hoping to find out how Moses became a genius in making the law being passed the way he wanted, how he did political transactions with others, how he maintained his grip over people. The author glossed over all of them. This is not a book for aspiring people who want to learn something from Moses--but more for academics who want to evaluate his legacy."
5,A Master Work.,I cannot add anything to the reviews above describing the book. Suffice it to say that it is probably the best combination of compelling narrative and factual research written in the 20th century. It has been recognized as a Masterwork and the recognition is both accurate and appropriate.
5,Extremely informative,A well-written first person documentary. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the war in the Pacific. The fact that Leckie was himself involved made it all the more interesting by really bringing this book to life.
4,"Good Set, Lousy Storage","We bought this set for our 4 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He's been playing with it non-stop for a week now. This is a good set for any kid that wants to make vehicles, since it contains four sets of wheels.The one thing that prevents me from giving this 5 stars in every category is that the tub it comes in doesn't have a lid! Why Lego would give you a tub with no lid is beyond me!"
1,Horrible movie,"Don't get me wrong most zombie movies can be cheesy but funny in that sense, this was jus bad, if u want a good zombie movie get the horde or dawn o the dead remake"
1,Avoid this garbage,The first couple of reviews must have been written by folks involved in the production. What horrid and inept film making. In an era where lower budget Zombie flics can actually be GREAT there is no excuse for this sort of crap. AVOID IT.
5,The best of the bunch,"I bought 5 different books for my family's trip to Orlando and found this one the most helpful. I only wish we'd bought it earlier...we picked it up a week before leaving and read it on the way down. But I wish we had it in time to take advantage of the author's information on the Disney hotels which was very through and gave you real direction about which resort is best for different kinds of people.The author's information about the theme parks was very helpful and saved us both time and money at several points. Her restaurant tips were also good. She steered us to what turned out to be our favorite place to eat fron the whole trip - The Prime Time Restaurant, which incidentially, was totally panned by the Unoffical Guide. But we enjoyed it so much we ended up eating there twice."
2,ok to use for a short bath,"there's gotta be a better product out there, this was ok but my hands would get tired of holding it since I had to keep pressing to keep the water going."
3,Looks great and probably is if it fits your faucet.,"Got a new farmhouse sink and thought this would work great for bathing our little Yorkie, but the attachment would not fit our sink. Doesn't fit the typical aerator on a kitchen sink."
2,OK,"Unless you just have to have this brand for what ever reason, your local drug store has same quality. Nothing special about this product."
4,Enlightened reading for young and old alike!,"My 14 year-old son breezed through all 12 in just a couple of weeks. He thoroughly enjoyed following the Earthens, Rainbows and Supernaturals throughout all of their adventures. Not since Harry Potter has a series kept him so enthralled. As both a mother and a child psychiatrist, I appreciate the Rainbow Chronicles&#65533; wholesome quality and theme of peace."
1,Woodward is lacking direction and missing the focus,"It would seem that Bob Woodward lacked the courage to investigate the Clintons that he had somehow mustered to bring down President Nixon. The impeachment proceedings that we are seeing today are evidence of the kid gloves that Bob used in the background investigation for this book. If I had wanted to read a book describing Clinton's greatness, I would have chosen one entitled ""How to lie under oath and get away with it."" This book was disappointing. I had expeceted much better investigation from someone who had been described as a great American for his work with Watergate. I believe now that the motivation for the Watergate investigation was his hatred of both Richard Nixon and the Republican party at large."
1,IT SUCKED,"In the space of one page, Dean Ing turned a great book into one that sucked so badly that for the first time in my life I was temped to throw a book into the garbage pai"
5,Guardians of Makuta,"The Manas are easily the most expensive Rahi. ..., it's unlikely that kids will be able to afford these. But parents can!The Manas are both crab-like creatures of Mata Nui. Building them isn't that hard (took me about 45 mins. per Manas) but little kids may need help from their parents. By building the different ""legs,"" you can then attach them to either side of the control box and continue building. When done it is quite pleasant. The remote controls are easy to use, but the book doesn't say how to use them. (Yellow and orange buttons. Push both forward and your crab moves forward. Push both backwards and your crab moves backwards. Yellow forward and orange backward will spin it right. Orange forward and yellow backward will spin it left.) It's a lot clearer when you have them.The only thing that's bad about it is that it takes 12 AA batteries. BUY RECHARGEABLE ONES!"
3,"Good lego design, bad form.","The design on this toy is classic lego technic, and in my opinion, the bionicle series is the best Lego technic toy series yet, being fun to build, but also fun to learn the saga. The series can even help teach how to fit parts of a system together. but this particular toy ruins the classic lego feel by adding a remote control. With the elctric addition, the toy's price also shoots up, making it unreasonable compared to most of the other Bionicle toys. This toy would have been much better without the remote."
4,Something wrong with the moter,"I found this set is quite a fun to play with the remote control. The fight between two crabs is exciting. Two crab can even combine to form a big breast. Howver, the building process is not so impressive as the set is not very complex. I found a problem with my set that the two motor for a crab doesn't seems equal in speed and power. Both crabs' left motor is considerably weaker than the right one. Not sure a QA problem or a isolated case."
4,"Conception : ""Parallel Minds""","**** - FOUR STARS==================This is an excellent Metal release. Very powerful, and very melodic. A must purchace for any Metal fan. I hear Iron Maiden influences throughout, and some Fates Warning / Queensryche / Angel Dust as well. The vocals are what makes this different, and overall, a unique experience. He sounds smooth, like F. Mercury {Queen}, but with a more Metal edge, very ineteresting indeed....I love the melodic guitars. I've been a Maiden fan since the early 80's, and these guys make a great Smith / Murray duo attack. Some of the coolest solos I've heard in years....I'm also convinced that Conception are not just another 80's clone band either, they've got their own style, and even though it's got an 80's feel, it's still fresh...If you like old-school Metal, and enjoy excellent musicianship, Conception's ""Parallel Minds"" is the purchace you've been looking for. I only wish I would have bought this ten years ago.."
5,great movie and love story,forget about the other review. if this movie does not touch you heart and soul. your dead
1,Still disappointed,"As a parent who has adopted two Korean children, I was excited to purchase this book, but came away with an empty stomach. Trenka reveals herself as selfish and arrogant and I'm not surprised that she had relationship tensions with her American family and adopted sister. I questioned her sincerity when she let money and vacation days come between her when her birth mother passed away. Her real struggle appears being a Korean in a white community. She seems only to find peace within herself after her birth mother has died and she's marries a white man, returning to Korea to show him off to her half sisters. The author should have written this memoir after she reached a level of self-awareness as well as learned the meaning of being humble, a respected trait in Korean culture. Adoption does not give entitlement."
4,not perfect but very worth reading for anyone connected to adoption,"I find it interesting that three of the negative reviews for this book all use the same language but the writer/s claims to be the parent of Korean children, a Korean with no connection to adoption and a Korean adoptee. Um...okay? If you are going to write an angry review it would be advisabe to pick an identity and stick with it ."
1,too dry,Just didn't like the mascara. Might as well wear nothing just from the way it looked. The mascara seemed a bit old.
3,Not Impressive,"The mascara goes on smoothly and without clumping, but it does not make your lashes particularly thick or longer. The Cover Girl Lash Blast mascara is a much better product that you can pick up in the drug store for a cheaper price."
3,too much fragrance,"I was able to deal with the huge brush and I do admit that it really plumps up one's lashes, but the excessive amount of fragrance in the formula made my eyes water. I had to exchange it for my old standby - Lancome Definicils."
4,Nice price for a nice model car.,"It was agift so I cant tell you how it turned out, but I know the real version turns my head severy time one goes by."
2,not the best...,They seemed to be cute but my kids didn't like them. The feet on the handle made it difficult to hold and they rusted in the dishwasher. I had to throw them out after a couple of months.
2,Ugh ...,"I finished the book, so it can't be a 1-star review.But the ending was so unbelievable & contrived as to leave me laughing at the end. In hindsight, 2 of the 4 plotline threads seemed totally unnecessary. (Why exactly was Siran Malveaux key to the plot ... other than to provide one requisite sex scene?)"
1,What a waste of paper,"One of the worst books I've read in a long time. Without giving it away, I'd say the ending was the equivalent of using the old tactic of a character waking up and finding out it was all a dream. An implausible and ridiculous plot that doesn't make sense even when it was all tied together in the end. Don't waste the money on this one."
3,H.R.T. in Action!,"This story sort of drug out but was still interesting.The role of the hero is played by Jeremy Waller.He is an F.B.I. agent who has been accepted in the H.R.T.(Hostage Response Team).This is an elite commando unit of the F.B.I.Waller has some rescue missions in Puerto Rico and Yemen.Another personality in this story is billionaire Jordan Mitchell theCEO of Border's Atlantic.He has come up with a new mobile phone that cannot be tapped.Another lead character,Senator Beechumconsiders this phone to be a dangerous weapon that can be usedby forces of terrorism.Because of this opposition Senator Beechum becomes a target of Jordan Mitchell.Waller enters the frey to stop the forces of evil(Jordan Mitchell).Waller does battle with Jordan's army of hired guns.It makes for an interesting read.All of the above named characters combine tomake this a readable book.Be sure to read it."
2,Disappointing,"A slow, tortuous and seemingly endless film of two young German lovers centered on the ups and downs of their relationship while on vacation in Italy. Did I mention that it's ""Draggy""? Truth be told, it was very difficult to sit through this insipid mess which is devoid of drama, suspense or even human interest. Be forewarned before buying or renting this one."
1,"More than Bad, it's evil.","Here Mayo compounds mistake upon thoughtless mistake through flimsy psychological speculations. Given the hindsight of history, precision denunciation of Mayo's work (carefully preserving the slightly tainted results of mostly accurate contributors to this school of thought, such as those of Douglas McGreggor) should really be a full-time activity for someone in Cambridge, MA (where Mayo worked). Such efforts would probably prevent another Enron-type business blow-out."
3,ok for my brother but not me,"my brothers and i each 1 bionicle. I got Lewa because i like his axe and ability to fly. My other brothers got Kopaka and the kicking guy whoever he is. my brother really enjoys this guy so i think other people will think he's COOl, get it? hes the toa of ice ha ha."
4,Solid prep book but practice tests could have been better,"Overall this book provides very good strategies for people who would rather study themselves than take a course. Joe Blog is an asset, and understanding him really helped me to root out wrong answers to alot of questions. However, the practice tests contained a few flaws and I felt some of the questions were unlike those on the actual SAT. Definetly a solid prep book, but consider the collegeboard one for better tests (although this book does provide explanations to all its questions unlike the collegeboard book)."
3,Apple Cutter,"Not as good a product as I expected. Does not cut potatoes very good, and opening for apples/potatoes is smaller than most of the items I wanted to cut. I'm not really thrilled with this product."
4,An excellent sourcebook for any superheroic campaign,"I've had this book for almost 10 years. It is a sourcebook for fans of the Justice Machine comic book, but also for any superhero RPG. This book reviews the history of the early JM comic, and I enjoyed reading that story material. This book provides a complete world setting (read: parallel Earth) as well as dramatic associations between that Earth and your normal campaign setting (read: secret underground city). It has dozens of detailed characters and some adventure material as well.Mechanically, it is a sourcebook for the original 1984 edition of Heroes Unlimited (q.v.). However, by ignoring a few out-dated sections (4 or 5 pages total), it is fully compatible with all the other Palladium material."
2,Goofy music,"Utterly bizarre. The music is cute in an irritating sort of way. Can't imagine paying good money for it, though."
4,"Not better than the first, but still impressed...","I actually heard this album before the first one. I was super impressed with floetry's creative and imaginative style, lyrics, and realistic and deep subjects. Then I was implored to check out the first CD and loved it even more. I don't know why they broke up, but they shouldn't have. Floetry is definitely a group that R&B world slept on...will always be one of my favs!"
3,Its ok but no floetic,"Dont get me wrong this album is good, but its just not great. I find myself skipping more tracks on this album than the last one were i bascially could listen striaght through. I actually hatd their first singke with common and i'm a hugh fan of his so its pains me to say that i hate any songs that he is attached to. 2 standout tracks are closer and imagination. Imagination sold me on buying this album even though i heard their other tracks and wasnt impressed. buy it if your a fan but if your just getting hip to them wait til the next one were they'd hopefully get their floactism back together. sorry sista from london but this just wasnt cuttin it for me,m even though i love ya to def."
5,Flotastic,"Floetry! You will not be disappointed. To find this style of music commerically is hard so my friend you have found a gem.Floetry have released an album much better than their first Floetic although that one is still worth a mention but that is another review altogether.You will not be disappointed. This a great CD for sitting back and taking it all in. Put it on while driving, sitting outside while watching the world go by or when you have a special someone over for some background music. Just beautiful!"
4,For rainy days and Mondays,"Fans of Lauryn Hill, India.Arie and Erykah Badu might want to give this smokin' British duo a try.Marsha ""the Songstress"" Ambrosius and Natalie ""the Floacist"" Stewart are the super cool ladies behind the unusually named ""Floetry"", and their sound, as you may have guessed, is a fusion of neo-soul and poetry.This is their third album, coming after Floetic (2002) and Floacism ""Live"" (2003), the first single from this album being being ""Supastar"" featuring Common. Songs to watch are ""Blessed 2 Have"", an upbeat hip hop track and the jazzy ""Closer""The UK version includes an excellent cover of Bob Marley's ""Waiting in Vain"", a smooth reggae/soul mix that makes getting this version worthwhile. There's another track ""I Don't Know What 2 Say"" which is also a nice bonus.This smooth neo-soul album is great for romantic evenings, or rainy days and Mondays.Amanda Richards, January 19, 2006"
5,Wow!,"I bought this album nearly over a year ago, there is rarely a moment that it is not near or in my CD player.The rhythms and sounds are extatic! But her voice is truely intoxicating. I think I'm in love!All of these other reviewers are dead on with how great this album is."
2,Fragile dishes!,"I ordered this product as a gift because it was the only one of this type with one-day and gift delivery to another address. Unfortunately it arrived with one of the dishes broken. Though probably ""dishwasher and microwave safe"" they are also ceramic and did not survive UPS handling.I suggest one of the metal types unless you are willing to take the chance of having to return them."
5,Martin & Lewis Collection - Vol. 1,I would like to tell everyone that this collection was the best of the best.I have been looking for a long time for a collection of Martin & Lewis like this one. It has given me many hours of enjoyment everytime I watch them.I recomend this collection to all Martin & Lewis lovers of all ages.
1,Too long for such a simple book,"The book doesn't teach you much on the strategy on MTG. It's just too simple. For the thickness of this book, I expected more from it."
3,Strange Incredibles,"Any live recording of the String band is worth hearing, but this late recording just makes you wish Robin and Mike had taped more of their early shows...this is OK but lets just say its a little short on magic. The best tracks are the opening ""Cousin Caterpillar"" which rocks out in fine style and the closing ""Ithkos"", which was always most suited to a live setting anyway. In between is a variable bunch of songs; Robin tries hard to inject new life into his classic ""Firts Girl I loved"", but the bossa-nova sort of version here will send you running for the original to remind you what a great song it is. Parhaps the clearest indication that the band's time was running out is that Gerard's instrumenmtal pieces sound fresher and more lively than almost anything else here. One for completists, I guess."
5,a workout that makes you smile,This is a super-fun workout which will get your heart rate up and keep you smiling. The live drumming is a fabulous addition. I really wish there was a Volume 2.
2,Academic Mumble Jumble,"This is not a book for the general public. In fact, it is not a book at all. It is a collection of papers written by Deborah Tannen and her students, most of which have not been published in peer-reviewed journals.If you have done a few years of graduate-school level study, you may be able to slug through some of these papers. The information density is low, of course, as is typical in the ""academic writing frame"", and the language dry. I personally find ""Chapter"" 2 definitely worth reading, and ""Chapter"" 1 & 6 marginally so, but the book overall is worth neither the price nor the pain."
5,WOW,As Modesitte does we get to see things from the other side. He tell us how we got there. Never saw this coming.

5,Eye-opener - great book for my life!,"I read this book about six months ago, when I was really depressed and knew something was wrong. The title of this book caught my eye because I had a sense that indeed I did become happy when something bad would happen. Sounds insane, but I had realized this was my truth. So I read the book, and the stories given helped me learn that I was not alone in these behaviors. It opened my eyes to look at my own life and choices to see how bad I treat myself and how I'm caught it this destructive cycle. This book helped me understand what I was doing and let me feel that there is nothing wrong with just me. I was not alone!! I highly recommend this book, and I tell many others who asked me how I've overcome so much this past year, that if you are depressed and know something is wrong in your life, this book is something you should read. I'm even going to read it again, because breaking the pattern of creating my own unhappiness is hard to break."
3,GREAT,"This book was truly great. The value is in the pictures, many rare which are being published for the first time. You see great ships like the Mauretania and Aquitania in dazzle paint, or the Queen Mary after the Curacoa incident. The facts are a little off in some parts, but overall is excellent,"
1,poor design leads to plugged outlet,"This probe, which is sold under various names, has proven pretty useless for me. The outlet for the bait in the probe's tip, if you happen to over- or undershoot the tunnel, gets plugged with soil. Removing the soil involves disassembling the probe, which generally gets jammed with the bait in the process & requires quite a bit of force. I would recommend using a simple garden stake & a trowel or shovel rather than bother with this thing.(I have heavy clay soil. This probe may work better with other soil types.)The bait is effective."
4,Serious tricks for the serious magician,"This is another great book by Jean Hugard densely packed with card tricks and other sleights - over 120 in all. Some things to consider: (1) these are not simple tricks, and will require significant practice to master (i.e., they are not self-working card tricks); (2) the text is sometimes difficult to follow and may require multiple readings. Otherwise, this is a very valuable resource for the serious card manipulator."
5,MBA in a book,"Substantive, quick & to the point. More than a very good checklist. Mini case studies provide concrete examples of concepts. Focus on just one or two concepts or underlying examples & this book is a winner. A great reference which I plan to consult every six months to maintain focus & not drop the ball in some other area of operations."
3,"Fair, but not that great","If you are interested in how a particular space suit patch was designed, fine. If you are interested in how they got to the moon, look elsewhere. The 5-point type on the descriptions is particularly bad - you need to buy reading glasses along with the book."
1,Where's the Value,"Perhaps Dick Lee is a guru of CRM and a valued consultant, but the book is not. I was disappointed in the fact that the book claimed to unfold secrets to Mr. Lee's success, but found nothing more than a few basic thoughts. There was no insight into any CRM planning, such as how to initiate contact with a prospect, nor any steps on how to conduct such a venture with a client. Any points that Mr. Lee brought up that might be insiteful, were left unfulfilled. I was expecting more than an advertisement for a seminar. I have no doubt that Mr. Lee is a wonderful consultant, and having worked for American Express, and with 3M, (both companies touted in preface of the book), I am a believer in his work. I have seen CRM have tremendous results. If you are looking to implement CRM there are a number of books to choose from, but this unfortuately is not one of them."
1,It is so basic,"These books are not worth the price. I have worked on CRM implementations for two years, and I usually study to improve my knowledge on CRM.[...] I decided to purchase both Dick Lee CRM books, steps I,II,II,IV. I studied them and [...] they do not provide solid tools to face real CRM projects."
4,Exceeded expectations,Common sense approach to planning a CRM effort. Focus on change management within the organization is unique approach. Theory of Constraints is a fundamental tool to process re-engineering.
5,A Great Resource No Matter What Deck You Use,"With its table of correspondences to the Crowley and Rider decks, and its introductory material on how to use Tarot as a tool for insight into the here and now, this book is a great resource not only for Osho Zen Tarot fans but for everybody who wants to get more out of their Tarot readings. Owners of the Osho Zen Tarot deck and its accompanying handbook will appreciate the in-depth explorations of the meanings of each of the cards. And in fact, even those who are not so much into Tarot but simply interested in understanding the ups and downs of life and its lessons will find many insights and much encouragement here. And finally, the little pop-out cards in the back are wonderful! Very nice quality, glossy paper makes them very nice to use."
5,One of my all-time favorites,Hysterical black comedy. Brilliant performances and nuanced acting. Feels more like a small independent film. Great film. One of my all time favorites.
3,Less alluring upon re-watching,"Ever since originally viewing this in a theater upon its first release, I carried the impression of an impressive entertainment. Yet, recently re-watching it on DVD left me somewhat disappointed. The tale itself is thin, the dialogue a little thread-bare and the sets just a tad on the low-budget side, often looking like a TV show instead of a big Hollywood movie. This got great reviews in its day. It just hasn't held up so well, in my opinion. Angelica Huston comes off best and Annette Bening least here. John Cusack falls somewhere in between, a little too wet behind the ears here to really bring much grit."
3,AN INTERESTING NEO-NOIR MOVIE.,"""The Grifters"" is one of the earliest Neo-Noir films that appeared in the early 1990s, and it helped to pave the way to films like ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""The Usual Suspects"", because the Film Noir genre was a little under the radar in the early 1990s.""The Grifters"" has a talented cast that includes John Cusack, Anjelica Huston and the beautiful Annette Bening. Perhaps the best interaction between characters are the hate-envy relationship between Anjelica's character and Annette's character, they hate each other and they are capable of some dirty tricks to make disappear the other.""The Grifters"" gets better in the final 30 minutes, a lot of interesting revelations are made, and the characters reveal their real intentions."
1,Vastly overrated,"Sleazy things happening to three sleazy characters neither I nor my girfriend could muster any feeling for. The highlight of the movie for me was ""the lady or the loot"". I'm a fan of John Cusack and I've liked Frears' other films. I simply could not see what the fuss was about this movie."
2,"Beautiful performances, bad idea","I don't usually take the time to review movies well beyond their release dates because, let's face it, who cares? I like film noir as much as anyone, but his is just well-performed drivel.SPOILER ALERT: So we're supposed to believe that, after having spent an entire movie establishing her love for her son, Huston is is willing to first disavow herself as a mother, then kill her son accidentally and then simply take the money and run? Right. Because they are grifters. Right. This is the laziest example of moral calumny you will find in a movie.There is nothing worth knowing or experiencing here. Move along."
4,It works,This jacket works pretty well protecting the camera from sand and water. I haven't tried to dive w/ it but inside a pool the water didn't touch the camera
3,Problem with condensation,"I recently used my camera with a SPKWA Marine Sports Pack during a trip to the Pacific coast of Colombia (it's a zone of tropical marine rain forest), where it was both hot and very humid (rain and marine mist and tropical humidity). While the case definitely protected the camera I was very disappointed by it's frequent tendency to get condensation inside the casing, in particular inside the clear lens window, making it - on too many occasions - impossible to get a good photograph. On such occasions it thus became not much more than a carrying case."
4,Peace of mind,"I bought this item just prior to a trip to the Bahamas, and right after I purchased the camera. We vacationed on a boat and traveled around in a dinghy, and it allowed me to carry and use the camera without worrying about getting it wet or sandy. I also used it for underwater photos while snorkeling in shallow water. However, the case does cut off the optical viewfinder, and it was difficult to see the screen in the bright sunlight/water/sand glare. That is the only problem I have with the case. All of the other functions of the camera worked fine, i.e., the zoom, changing the settings, reviewing photos, and accessing the menu. I shopped around before buying, and Amazon had the best price."
5,This is one of my three year old daughter's favorite CDs.,"My daughter and I love to listen to Sue Trainor's Under Tables, Out Back Doors CD. The lyrics tell fun stories and are easy for kids to remember. Our favorite song is the Bear Missed the Train; we find ourselves singing it often. This is a great CD and we highly recommend it."
1,Horrible,"Most horrible Electronic Thing I have ever bought, uncomfortable and too much distortion, they hurt your ears after 20-30 minAvoid them"
3,On the road again,"Reacher is back on the road and the series is much better off. Great action sequences are separated by good scenes and detail, that never the less, cry out for some editing. Reacher is tough enough, the writing needs to get leaner. Great atmosphere, you'll burn under the Texas sun. Keep 'em coming."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered 3 books....purposly from the same supplier, to try to reduce the shipping charges. The supplier did not consolidate the shipment, which was very disappointing.Also, two of the books TOTALLY fell apart while I was reading them! Not sure if the glue was dried out or what the problem was but it was annoying and embarrasing. Was on vacation in LasVegas at the pool when reading these books....people noticed and commented. It was not a good advertisment to purchase used books thru Amazon!"
3,"I liked it, but not as much as the others so far.","I read this because it was part of the series. While I don't think it was really, really good, it still was a good read. I'm attempting to read all of the Reacher books, so naturally I was gonna read this. It's one of those cases where individual tastes may vary."
4,Great Read!,"I'm a huge Jack Reacher fan and this novel WAS a good read but the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it didn't portray Jack Reacher in his notable rough and tumble persona that leaves the reader with baited breath wanting more, which usually happens. Yes, he has a moment in a seedy Texas bar along a deserted road where he kicks the you-know-what out of 2 hick characters but that was it. Reacher wound up being more a soothsayer than butt kicker and that was sort of a let down. I love it when he puts his military training to work on bad guys with lightning speed. There should have been more of that in this book and that would have earned it 5 stars."
4,Likable,"Good solid mystery with a tough guy, a cute kid, a troubled woman and a couple of other typical type characters but what the heck - I liked it."
3,Went a little too far,"Lee Child is a wonderful writer, but frequently he tries too hard to create the ""perfect character"" or the ""perfect twist"" to his plots. ""ECHO BURNING"" is a good example of a book that over-reaches itself. The characters are too heavily drawn, the plot is convoluted, and the details just don't quite ring true. Jack Reacher is a good, solid character, but he can't possibly be the ""super-hero"" that he is written as. Lee Child's grasp of the military as a way of life and as a career leaves something to be desired. There are gaps and false notes from time to time. The plot is way too far-fetched to be believable but it does hold the reader's interest.Child's treatment of the story and the characters in ""ECHO BURNING"" makes for a good read and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book and will defitely read the next one."
4,One of my favorite reacher novels so far.,Reading them in order. This was one of my favorites. The plot flows well. A fast read. Hard to put down
1,It gets hot in Texas,How many times should an author inform the reader that it is hot...I quit counting after the first fifty. What tripe!
1,Way Too PC For Me,I am in agreement with the others who found this book tiresome for its PC content. Makes for a tiresome read.
3,Ridiculous,"All of the Reacher novels require you to suspend belief somewhat. But this one is simply absurd from beginning to end. Nothing that happens is even remotely foreseeable, the whole thing is disjointed, and when you find out ""the truth"" it is the mirror opposite of every clue that has been uncovered along the way. It reminded me of reading the original Sherlock Holmes books: while the reader is stuck snooping around with Watson who literally doesn't have a clue, Sherlock is off uncovering the true mystery, and at the end of the story, reveals all to Watson and the reader based on clues you never even saw.Anyway .... I like Reacher, and I have enjoyed the series, but this one just seemed absurd."
2,Echo burning - slow to start,My least favorite Reacher book so far. It was very slow going with all the long distance driving around Texas. I like some action along the way - didn't seem to have much of that to me.
1,Ditto.... waste of time,I am a Lee Child fan and have read all his preceding novels to Echo Burning. This book never gets off the ground until the last 100 pages. What a huge disappointment. Skip this one.
1,Texas Trashing,My teenage son and I both started to read all the Reacher series. but when we got to this one we had to struggle to finish it. This one sounded like it was written by La Raza. Everything was from the Mexican point of view. It made all white Texans sound like idiots and bigots. We will not be moving on to book 6. Just sayin.
4,GOTTA LOVE REACHER,"lIKE MOST FANS OF REACHER WE WOULD LIKE AT LEAST ONE BOOK A MONTH!!NO MATTER HOW BANGEDUP HE GETS HE'S GOOD TO GO FOR THE NEXT BOOK.REALLY THOUGH, TOM CRUSE AS JACK?? HE'S NOT EVEN 6 FT TALL!!TOUGH GUY RUSSELL CROWE IS YOUR PERFECT JACK REACHER!!! MY VOTE ANYWAY."
5,Echo Burning,"Lee Childs Reacher series is a very good portrayal of a man on the go, and running into strange situations at every turn in the road. The books are well written and keep my attention."
4,Jack Reacher,"Not as good as some of the Jack Reacher books but it was still good. Didn't take long to get through it and enjoy it. If you like Jack Reacher you will still like this one as well. Good book, great condition, will continue to buy from them in the future if they have what I want."
1,Do not think about buying this one.,This item never worked. The glue was not strong enough to pull out dents. You will not pull even a minor dent out with this kit even though you follow instructions very carefully. I was really disapointed.
1,Worth Every Penny Only If It's Free,"However, since it does cost more than a penny, it's grossly overpriced. After repeated application on a minor ding, two things remain on the vehicle; the glue and the ding."
3,Ding Review,"It pulled out 'part' of the dent, but I still have the remnants of a careless ""hit and run"" driver hitting my car in a parking. I would NOT recommend this product."
1,dont work on motorcycle tank dent,The item was as advertised but would not remove any part of a dent on my motorcycles gas tank. Might work on others.
1,Doo Doo,"Once you get the Ding King delivered here is what you should do. Carefully unwrap the package making sure not to damage the outer cardboard box. Remove the inner box containing the Ding King and walk over to your nearest trash recepticle. Gently place the Ding King in said trash recepticle, close lid and go back to the best part of your purchase. The beautiful cardboard box it came in. Seriously this is the biggest waste of money there is. I am embarrased for even purchasing something that started out as an info-mercial. Does not work at all. Maybe if you drive a car where the sheet metal is the same guage as a soda can. If you have anything thicker, take your money and throw it out the window. Junk!!!!!!"
3,Only a partial success,"If the dent is only pushed in on a soft section of the car the Ding King might do the job, but if the mental has crimping or is in a stiff area the Ding King either doesn't work at all or leaves evidence of the dent. The hardest part of the job is removing the hot glue from the car."
1,Ding King is a scam !!!,Ding King is a scam. I tried it around 10 times and it didn't work! I do not want to say more. Just type Ding King in Google and you will find some articles about it. See them your self.[...]Ding King is a scam and they should get prosecuted
1,DKM ... ... (knock off the River Dance ...),"They have milked the irish background thing a little to much (so they are irish, big deal so am I, doesnt mean I have to like Celtic music for ""ethnic awareness"") and their sound has just gotten so ridiculously silly too... they sound like the Sex Pistols when they did that joke pirate song ""friggin in the riggin"" accept these guys take it seriously and so do their fans...plus all the right wing banter/patriotism/skinhead etc. is just dumb and makes the music even less enjoyable...I gues this just proves that being a proud ""irish american"" is basically trying to side step the ""boring white american"" category you belong in..."
2,know the feeling of eating too much sour candy?,"thats exactly how this album feels! you know, some irish songs and influences are good, but this is ridiculous. when 95% of your lyrical content is irish at least keep it interesting.(spicy mchaggis jig??? what the....?) so i say if your even interested in this cd or something 95% irish, get drunken lullabies or swagger by flogging molly instead, if you dont already have them. id also recommend the new murphys cd ""the warriors code"" if you want faster irish music done good. i give it 2 stars because its not nearly as bad as some of the other stuff out there. oh yeah rocky road to dublin kicks arse....thats about the only reason to even put this cd on. easily the worst DKM album"
5,More Folk from the Murphys,"If you liked the first three albums from the Dropkick Murphys (that includes the Singles Collection), you'll love this one. Classic Murphys, with a more folkish sound. They've added several new band members and they make it all the better."
3,Not bad but could use some originality,"I like these guys but, I'm disappointed that they completely ripped off the Young Dubliners version of Rocky Road to Dublin."
4,A good place to start learning what is safe and healthy.,"My review is based on the 3rd edition of this book. This book was required reading in my early childhood education program. It is a great introduction to what is safe, healty, and nutritious for children. A simple straight forward approach to information about children that every parent and/or caregiver should know."
4,Sasha has the brightest costume of the series,"She looks a bit more like a gypsy than a genie to me but the hot colors in her outfit really pop. She has a wonderful Bollywood look overall.her extra outfit doesn't look as great but since she comes wearing the outstanding one, this is not much of a drawback. the little fortune telling bottle is a cute extra but the necklace that doubles as box handle is a throw-away as even kid's jewelry but it does add to her overall in the box appeal"
1,CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT!!!!!,"I like Sasha because she is black just like me and not only that, she is T O T A L L Y CUTE! She's dressed as a genie and she has mystical powers. I have been waiting to get this doll ever since it came out and I sooooooo hope it's worth waiting for - and I mean it!"
4,DM Guide II,"This book has several good points. It has some new material and a few new things for players and GM's alike. It's one irritating thing is the number of ""after you buy the canned game book spend 4 hours reviewing it"". It could have had a lot more things to help those of us with a creative mind that like to generate our own worlds. It is, overall, worth the money."
5,"Like it, Love it, or Hate it...","I'll be blunt. Sheryl Crow is one of my favourite female artists out there today. I understand why others might not like her style (or her voice for that matter) but to each their own... As for this particular song, it really blew me away. The harsh edge she brings to the lyrics, the raw energy she gives into this performance makes this song appear all too real for me. The 'screeching' (as some may call it) is overwhelming at times, but that's what I love about it. It's meant to overpower you... and it made me happy."
3,there is better stuff out there,"this ep is three songs. the 1st is i dont like the drugs as it appears on album. the last two are synth and techo REMIXES which does not make them bad, they are quite good but if your not down with remixes or you dont need one album with three version of, essentially, the same song then this is not for you. the backwards snare is cool on the last song and there are some interesting ""tricks"" they use to make the song a little different but all in all, there is better singles out there than this"
4,Great if you speak the language,"Someone recommended this artist to me and I had a hard time finding his music anywhere, so I tried Amazon.com and found several of his cds.I do not speak this language and was disappointed to find nothing I could understand. The music sounds spiritual and very soothing. He's obviously an important artist with a lot to say. I wish He had music in english. He probably does, but this cd doesn't. For those who enjoy his music and understand what he's saying, I'm sure you'll enjoy it tremendously. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. This is not to put him or this kind of music down at all."
5,it works,"I've had this for a year, and it has always worked exaclty as it's suppose to. No problems whatsoever."
2,COLOR BROWN IS NOT REAL,"BUY brown belt and I am very dissatisfied with the product because it THE PRODUCT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE PICTURE OF THE AMAZON, TO THE BEGINNING BECAUSE THE COLOR ME LLEGO MAS IS A DARK BROWN TO THE IMAGE OF WHAT IS THE SECOND TOMMY LOGO ON ANYTHING NOT APPEAR IN THE IMAGE OF THE MIO HAS THE LOGO OF METAL AND THE IMAGE TO SEE A SAMPLE LOGO D AMAZON WEB. There is no doubt that the material is excellent BUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRODUCT ARE NOT. Please note this comment to buy a belt of brown"
2,Belt Buckle Falls Off,"This belt looks nice, but for $20+ it should not fall apart on day 3. The belt buckle is hardly secured, and the strings holding it in place have fallen off with little to no use. The leather loop also falls off, very annoying."
2,Song from the Analogue era!,"I've been an a-ha fan since the first time I heard ""Take On Me"" on the radio. I have bought and thoroughly enjoyed each song on every album these guys have made. Except this one. Who's idea was it to make a CD with half the album dedicated to reliving the 60's. At any moment I was expecting the next track to be ""White Rabbit"". These songs could have easily been sung with the a-ha chemisty we all know and love. But the psychedelic channeling of John Lennon, Jim Morrison, and Grace Slick just doesn't work for a-ha. The whole love affair that Paul has for the 60's sound works for his other band Savoy, but completely fails for a-ha. The first 6 tracks are the a-ha signature sound, but the last 7 tracks are just a ""long strange trip"" to the 60's. I understand that a-ha's sound needs to progress and evolve, but this CD is de-evolution. That's why it's named Analogue. Guess we'll just have to chalk this album up as a bad one amoung seven good ones. Hope the next is better."
1,A blueprint for disaster,"This book tells you how to use inbreeding and linebreeding, and it teaches you the basics of Mendelian genetics, but these help to manage one or two traits at a time.The problem is that genes don't assort one trait at a time! Genes are linked to chromosomes. While we were all busy inbreeding and linebreeding to 'fix' the desirable traits of breed type and conformation, something else happened, and now we are producing a steady increase in unwanted traits that we call genetic defects.Time magazine has an interesting article on this problem..."
2,I wouldn't exactly call it erotic fiction,"It wasn't horrible, but I'll probably donate it to the library.It's as sleazy as a Jackie Collins book, but not as well-written. The plot wasn't bad, but I've read it a thousand times in a thousand other books.Further, the sub-plot of the protagonist's best friend has little to nothing to do with this book; indeed, the two might have better been fleshed out as two separate books.Finally... I can't help but wonder... have the author's parents read this?"
2,20 in a dozen,This is your typical book you buy when you jump on a plane for 5 hours. Halfway the trip you are so bored that you will probably leave it on the plane.
2,Poor child must wonder...,"Poor child must wonder what E.L. James has that she doesn't. (""Nothing"" turns out to be the answer, except for a movie contract and about quarter of a billion dollars.)"
4,great but plain,"I Don't Like The Drugs(but the drugs like me)certainlly ain't one of Mansons strongest songs and certainlly sounds different then most of his stuff but the song has some cool things to it like Dave Navarros guitar over a pimped out David Bowieish rythem kind of reminiscing of the song ""Fame"".Halfway through the song theres a catchy hook ""theres a hole in our soul, that we fill with dope and were feeling fine"".All in all this song is good but plain and this is coming from someone who likes every Manson song recorded."
3,"easy to clean, but doesn't work very well","This only gets 3 stars because it is so easy to clean. It barely holds any oil or sauce, so you don't get much basting done with it."
2,The pages fall out!,"Warning- for occasional use only-- the pages are poorly bound and fall right out. No matter what the content is, if a book doesn't stay together, it's time to move on. I want to have a book, not pages and pages."
1,It's impossible,"It's impossible for anyone who does not know the Cyrillic alphabet to cope with this dictionary, as for some reason it does not devote any space to showing the English translation of the Cyrillic letters. Also, the print is fine and pale.I concede that this is one book I should have looked at before purchasing. As they say, let the buyer beware."
4,HOW BAD WAS IT?,"The year 1816 is known in the US for days of bitter cold in the Northeast that summer. Europeans suffered major crop failures only one year after the Napoleonic Wars. The author examines this year and how the eruption of a volcano the year before may have influenced the climate. The book uses a mixture of science and history to better understand what occured.This is one of the few works of its kind I have ever seen. While far from fascinating, it does shed light on a period only dimly understood, and is a must read for anyone greatly interested in climate change or historic volcanoes."
2,Scam,"George Michael may not have invented soulless music but, as this CD proves, he has certainly perfected the art."
1,This is garbage,This is the epitome of lame 80's music! Everything about this CD is pathetic!! I hate the '80's just because of the ambigious cheese that Wham represents. Thank god they are no longer around.Listen to some Pantera if you would like some real music.
2,He went there alone,"Some people can take me with them into their self absorbed, depressed indulgences, having spent most of my twenties in that space myself (and occasionally still) However, Howe Gelbs' Hisser is too self indulgent and lacking in musical originality to allow me to do more than ask ""Why, Howe?"""
5,Made great hummus from scratch,I don't really like garbanzo beans and found a recipe for traditional hummus using these beans. They cooked easily and the hummus was great.
5,Affordable Great CD,"I'm not a classical music buff - I don't know the difference between one orchestra and another and many times I think of classical music as that which helps me fall to sleep (I enjoy classical music, but I don't know it very well.) I purchased this album for Symphony No. 3 in C minor for organ that I wanted to hear and this was the cheapest album I could find with that on it. Surprisingly, I ended up really enjoying the entire CD. I keep it on rotation in my car's CD system and friends (who often have no interest in classical music and who ride in my car) often ask me ""who is this?"" and have commented that this music often feels like it could easily be the soundtrack for a movie.I would recommend this for those who are just getting into classical music as I think it has become one of my favorite CDs. I can't tell you how it would compare to other recordings, but for my purposes, it's just fine."
1,It's good but at the same time disposable,"I was impressed by this stapler when we initially had one. However, it broke down after a month. We thought that maybe we just bought a lemon. The second piece we bought also broke down after a month of regular use. And we just normally staple an average of 10 pages or below."
5,DUH!!!!!!!!!!!,"Many people believe that this book THE OMINOUS OMNIBUS is actually the anticipated book twelve in A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS.Reality check not only do the people at AMAZON say underneath the product description that it is a complacency of books THE BAD BEGINNING,THE REPTILE ROOM,and THE WIDE WINDOW but it also says A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS:THE OMINOUS OMNIBUS (BOOKS 1-3)So all you people out there assuming its book twelve make sure you pay attention to details!"
5,"Really nice, smooth, and large","This is a top quality mouse pad worth the money. I use this on my logitech M510 infrared laser mouse and this pad really improves the tracking of the mouse over the bare desk top that I would otherwise use. The mouse glides smoothly over the surface and removes all jittery movements that I was getting off of my glossy desk surface. The mouse pad is really large, which I like because I rarely run out of surface space when working between my 2 monitor set-up."
5,Excellent low-friction pad,"This is the smoother surface of the fUnc mousepads. It is only single sided, with a rubber type backing that helps keep the mousepad in place, which works very well on my glass topped desk. My G500 glides effortlessly across it, while still giving just enough tactile feel for precise movements (and aiming in games). The surface is large enough so I never run out of tracking room, but not too big as to take up half my desk. Tracking for the G500 sensor has never been an issue on this surface. The mouse's feet are the originals and have not worn down after 6 months of intense use. It is also very, very thin. As a gamer, I recommend this for any user looking for a solid mousepad."
4,As advertised,The toaster performs very well. All the features are well thought out. The lifting lever is especially useful. The only negative I have is that it is larger than some people would like. The size is fine for a spacious kitchen but more difficult if space is limited.
4,Seiko Arctura men's watch,"This timepiece is a sturdy, functional unit that was as advertised and a very good value. It was received quickly and in perfect condition."
3,Not Bad. But Not Particularly Quiet,"A shortcoming with the Bionaire Tower Fan is that it is fairly noisy in operation, which may be fine in some situations, but is not so good in a quiet office environment, which is where I had intended to use it.Because of that, I bought a different fan for the office and have moved the Bionaire elsewhere, where it gets occasional use and where the noise is less bothersome. In its new role, it is adequate for the occasional use it gets, and the timer is useful.Overall, the fan has been reasonable, but if I were buying again I would choose a different design."
5,Wisdom in words,"This author has is able to write about that which is ultimately indescribable in concepts, with great clarity and yet leaving the reader more awed. He opened wide my vision of what is possible by his vision and understanding and also inspired confidence in my innate capacity to realise it. Gratitude."
5,Great Product,"I love this product , my Periodontist recommended them to me after my last deep cleaning , and scaling this interdental excels at getting into the recesses and back teeth. They are super easy to use and highly effective.I will be a loyal user to this product."
4,"Beautiful, loving words, in well crafted works.","The works are sincere in their emotion, tender in their descriptions, and positioned well by the editor. It is a wonderful idea to allow, so openly, the world a chance to view black love."
3,Manual card shuffler,Shuffler didn't work smoothly. Multiple cards sometimes get jammed in the rollers of the shuffler. A dissappointment.
4,A Great Introduction,"Gunnar Karlsson's book is a great introduction to Icelandic history. It is wonderful for the curious reader. However, as a scholarly work, it is lacking in precise details. In comparison to Knut Gjerset's History of Iceland, it is an easier read but with less information. While Karlsson touches upon a vareity of topics, he does not delve into them at great depth. However, this book would be great to find a topic that the reader would like to research or learn more about just because the nature of the book gives such a broad overview."
4,Great soundtrack,Saw the movie and loved the soundtrack. I was very pleased with the ease of finding the soundtrack on Amazon and the delivery time was excellent.Thanks
4,great album:a must for any obscurity fan,"I originally picked this album up in a Philadelphia record store not knowing what to expect until I got it home and played it. I was surprised how good it was. When I found it on CD I immediately picked it up. I'm glad that it is now available. Go get a copy, throw it on the stereo and enjoy. Special sneak performance by Phil Collins."
3,Another good package,"This is the second remixed CD from the Verve Remixed series. These tracks are still well mixed but I do find a few tracks which are quite noisy (a bit over-the-top). Still, I think there are enough good dance tracks to keep this CD in your stereo for sometime. If you are asking for more, then try getting the 'Complete Verve Remixed Box-Set' which comes in a package of four (3 + 1) CDs."
2,Volume 2,"The first ""Verve/Remixed"" focused on Divas, mostly those of the Jazz genre. This disc deviates from that enjoyable formula by expanding to female pop singers, male vocalists, and instrumentalists.VERVE/REMIXED 2 consists of 14 newly remixed songs. Disc packaged in clear jewel case; total running time: 72:08. Booklet does not include information about the original recordings (not even songwriting credits).There are once again two remixes of Nina Simone recordings. There are also two Ella Fitzgerald recordings remixed. Several instrumental tracks are remixed - I don't get the point of that, but they are included here.This sequel is not nearly as good as the original."
3,Good but not Great,"I really liked the first verve Remixed album the best. It was a bit more commercially oriented and had more uptempo tracks. Not to say that there aren't any uptempo tracks on Verve 2, but the tracks are more obscure. As a DJ I can really only use the Sarah Vaughn ""What Lola Wants"" for its commercial appeal. There are some really nice downtempo tracks which can be handy for late night trippin' in the clubs."
5,My Favorite Album When I Was 12,"Hey,This was my favorite album when I was 12, and I still like it, so hey! it must be good! It's melodic uptempo punk, and it's great fun!"
2,Not a good game at all; kids might like ramp though,"My pet peeve is when toy designers think of a gimmick and then design a game around it. The game should have a good premise first (i.e. Monopoly), and then you add the 'extras'. This game is all gimmick. The rules don't make a whole lot of sense, the game pieces don't stay on the hill and always fall off. My boys liked knocking the marbles (""kryptonite"") down the hill, trying to see whose marble would make it down first. The game held no interest whatsoever. If you want a marble run, get a real marble run. If you want a game get a real board game. This is neither."
5,Great book for any Animator,I bought this book not knowing what to expect. What I found was a book full of valuable resources and tips to help out any aspiring or current animator. The book was simple to understand coupled with the tutorials at the end of each chapter makes this an essential for anyone interested in computer animation.
2,skimpy,"This thin tome is good for little more than getting a ""feel"" for Maya.Maya does not lend itself to this kind of feel-good book. It's beautifully designed in a world where literally every other may book is ugly from cover to cover. But the nice layout comes at the sacrifice of desperately needed content. There's even an incorrect step in the crucially important particles section."
2,"This was mated with the X-10 PowerHouse Controller, which did not work.","Well we tried using this with fluorescent bulbs, which came on, but would not turn off. Then we tried using this with 4-watt LED bulbs, it did not work. Then later I doubled them up to see if it would work with 8-watts of LED, so I guess this receiver only works with the older incandescent bulbs."
2,You get what you pay for... :( Disappointing product.,"I bought this product because I love my JLab headphones, but unfortunately I was very disappointed with it. Sure it get's loud, but it sounds like garbage if you turn it up past about half-volume. There's absolutely no bass at all. It sounds very ""tingy"" and the poor AUX connection to your mp3 player causes a lot of static. The slot where you are supposed to insert your mp3 player does not suit my ipod nano very well at all, and the rubber cover that is supposed to hold your ipod snug in the slot doesn't even fit my ipod. Maybe it's designed for an older generation ipod, but either way it's useless for me. I guess you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a good quality ipod dock, spend the extra money and get an iHome. Don't buy this product because unless you enjoy your music sounding really crappy, you will be very disappointed."
3,"Fun for a kid, a little flimsy","While this toy is by far my 7 year old son's most valued treasure, I am, as a parent, disappointed in its overall quality and durability. The plastic housing is not very strong and we've had to ""operate"" on it a couple of times to put it back in good working order. I have it set aside right now in order to try to glue the two pieces that form the outer stem of the ""screwdriver handle"" together to make it more sturdy. It is splitting at the seam, not ""broken"" per se, just showing wear after only about 3 weeks of play time.The light is nice and bright, it's a good size for little hands, but for a boy who is loath to part with it, it could definitely be made in a more durable fashion."
3,You get what you pay for......,"It's a cheap toy. I just wanted to say ""I have a sonic screwdriver"". I can say that now. It's a cheap-ass looking you....but whatever. It's a toy."
2,not very illuminating,"I can't really add much to the other reviewers,but this is quite frankly not worth the money.It is too small and has only one led for illumination.I was hoping for a real flashlight for this price.It has to be pretty darn dark to get much value out of this as an actual flashlight.The on/off switch is very flimsy,as well,and I can see its future imminent failure.It is already hard to keep on.I suggest buying the full size replica,instead.You get almost as much light out of it (although not white light) and it makes the noise!"
4,Doctor Who Sonic Screwdriver LED Torch,I would not say that the toy is educational but if you are a Doctor Who fan it does not matter. The torch is fun but if you are looking for a full scale prop of the new series just know it is an inch or so smaller that the original prop.
1,Awful edition of a beautiful book,"This book would have deserved a better treatment: sloppy printing (blurred focus; misaligned, pale colours) and a careless translation in prose make this English edition incomparably worse than the wonderful German original with its graceful drawings and elegant rhymes. The first book ever I refused to accept; I sent it back to Amazon...Let's hope for a better English edition which does justice to this beautiful Art Nouveau classic!"
2,a bit thin,"There's not much to this book considering what it's priced at. The illustrations are so-so and the story is quite simple and not written very well. As for my 3 year old: she liked the pictures but I felt the story didn't really capture her attention. There are better nature/seasonal stories out there that fall into the ""classic"" catagory."
5,I WOULDNT EAT THIS GARBAGE BUT...,"THIS IS MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE CEREAL. I TRIED EDUCATING HIM ON THE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFO ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN (PLEASE READ THE 2ND REVIEW!) BUT HE'S A 53YR OLD GROWN MAN MAKING HIS OWN DECISION. I HAD 2 GIVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE IT ARRIVED QUICKLY, THE PKGING IN PRISTINE CONDITION, THE CONTENTS R FRESH, IT HAS A FAR OFF DUE DATE + COST ME NEARLY HALF WHAT I PAY IN THE SUPERMARKET. BV IF U HAVE MORE SENSE THAN MY HUSBAND, PLEASE DONT EAT THIS STUFF!"
4,"Good, but it needs to get better","I liked reading this particular Sweet Valley University book. Everyone is going undercover at Verona Springs, Bruce and Lila have no idea what is going on, there is more to Bunny's fiance Paul than meets the eye, and Jessica is hilarious as Perdita from Argentina complete with accent. I only wish that Tom would catch on that Dana and Scott are keeping him and Elizabeth apart and I also wish that Todd Wilkins would get back into the picture and get back with Liz. I don't care what anyone says, Tom does not deserve to get back together with Liz, not after the way he treated her when she told him about his father George. Tom just needs to know that Dana is the reason why Liz never got that letter. Once that mystery is solved, then Tom and Liz can be friends, but Todd needs to be Liz's man."
4,it's not the best but it is okay,it is not the best svu book i have read but it has potential and one more thing i think liz should not get back together with tom watts.
4,Love it!,"This is one of the easiest coffee makers on the market to use, and it makes a great cup of joe, too. The timer works great, and is something we're certainly thankful for in those early morning hours.The only thing that threw us off at first is it seems to need more water than what you think - when you pour water in to the ""2 cup"" line, you really only get one good sized mug out of it. So remember if you want to brew 2 mugs of coffee for morning, to fill the line to the ""4 cup"" mark. It's not a big deal at all, just something to be aware of.Happy brewing!"
1,Which Pandemonium?,"I've been looking for cd releases of a band from Alaska named Pandemonium. In '83, they released Heavy Metal Soldiers. In '85, Hole in the Sky. In '88, they released The Kill which included a metal version of Radar Love. I'm back to waiting for Metal Blade to release cds..The album being sold here is from a group described as being part of the ""early eighties Holland Hardcore scene."""
3,From the 80's...literally,"I knew this was a learning system that was created in the 80's, but you think the company would update the contents - like the instructional video is in VHS only. I don't know anyone who has a VHS player, including myself. Yes, there is a written instruction manual, but it's something like 200 pages long! When I contacted the company about getting a DVD version of the instructional video, they said they don't and will never have one."
2,Not too sturdy,"Nice, but not that sturdy. The glued parts came undone easily. These are ok looking in person, but I'd consider them more for decoration or very very light use than something daily. I replaced them with paper coasters for what its worth."
1,Many errors in text,"Palinski is full of errors, confusing and sometimes contradictory explanations. It seems to have been written by someone who is unfamiliar with Oracle, and just blindly compiled material from different sources.I had to check every topic by referring to other documents and manuals.In the beginning, you see this book is like college text, not for working Oracle person. I have more than 15 years experience in Oracle and did not find it useful."
2,It has been done better.,"This is a pretty familiar tale of a father who has his previously unknown child dumped on him by a long-forgotten one night stand. The story is both predictable and somewhat boring, but the worst part is the music. It's not really terrible, but it's very simple and some of it was obviously written for the Breslin girl, who is obviously not a musician in any way. That said, the ACTING in this movie is pretty good. Abigail Breslin, especially does a great job in that department. After all, she is an actress, so that's what she does. However, when they were casting the part, it might have been better to put someone in the role who actually had some musical background, as well. There are some very good acting performances by several of the supporting players, too. Unfortunately, even really good acting can't raise the level of the poor material enough to make it very interesting."
3,I like the music but thought the story was a little lame.,"I enjoyed this movie primarily for the music. When you bring in a child, it's either going to work really well or not so well, and unfortunately this was just a little too obvious as it tugged on the heartstrings. i think the trouble was in the writing, not the acting. Pleasant, but not a stunner."
5,Long Time Favorite,"I read this book when it first came out, in the eighties, and read it so many times it finally fell apart. I remember this book so vividly years and years latter. As an adult it will be interesting to see what I think about it now. I would really encourage any young girls in grade 5/6 to read this book. My mom told me that my aunt had gotten curious about this book, that she saw me reading over and over, and carrying it around with me. So when I had accidentaly left it at her house, she read it, and really enjoyed it. Anyway, read it, enjoy it."
3,My Husband...Rock Hudson,I look forward to reading this book. I just cannot do so at the present time.
1,Lame,Not worth the money- waste of money and I wish I wouldn't have bought it! Wish I would have done more research but I love Rock Hudson!
4,PMP Exam Prep 5th Edition,The book arrived on time and good conditions. This was a cake walk and I will order from this source again.
5,"Simple language, great content","This book (or equivalent :-) seems to be obligatory supplement to PMBook for PMP candidates, especially when english is not the mother-tongue.I don't know other PMP preparation books (apart from very dry and hardly-readable PMBook), so I cannot compare, but this one seems to have everything you need."
4,Thanks,"Thanks very much for the prompt delivery of the book.RegardsSesha GadiyaramP.S- I believe this book was delivered by priority mail or using a service that costed around $8.When I ordered this book, I do not remember requesting any priority delivery or a service that would charge a relatively high postal charge."
2,I passed but not sure this book helped,The PMP test I took covered topics that are not addressed anywhere in this book. I spent most of the exam marking questions for review and then taking my best guess. Rita needs to do the following to make this book worth buying:1. Cut the arrogance and sarcasm2. Actually cover topics that appear on the exam3. Provide practice exams that are worded similarly to the tests---the test questions in this book did not even resemble the grammatical structure and syntax that I encountered on the real exam.Bottom line: buy another book
2,Overhyped,"The tips in this book are useful, but the book has many problems:-incomplete or dated coverage: I took the test this morning (I passed) and I would estmate that close to 10% of the questions were on topics that got no coverage at all or dated coverage.-errors: although the website states that addenda are published, there are mistakes and omissions in the book that no corrections have been published for yet.-marginal presentation: I did not feel the book was organized well. Furthermore the index is quite poor. It took longer to use than it should have.-pompous attitude: While I didnt remove any points for this I think if you are going to continually mention how PMs should be fired for project failure or mistakes you should at least get the content of your book correct.-too much crosselling: again no points removed but it is annoying .If you can live with the errors in the book add a star. The tips are useful but I don't think it comes near to living up its hype."
4,"Excellent Book, need some improvement...","GOOD:I found this book to be one of the best out there for:->Makes you think practically in terms of real world PMs.->Tells you a whole lot of responsibilities of a PM outside of what is stated in the PMBOK.->Exercises at the end of chapters are really goodNOT SO GOOD:I think the book can be better organized. Its hard to tell if she is talking about tools, or inputs etc for the knowledge area / process group. So one has to refer to the PMBOK to know or use your own head of course.Overall, highly recommended and the book is to keep after the exam as well."
4,A necessary read for the exam,"Yes, Rita's style can be off-putting at times, but since Rita helped develop the PMP, knowing her style of questions is VERY useful. Combine this with the Andy Crowe book and you'll get a great preparation. I've used this combination in PMP study groups that I facilitate and it's worked out very well.Don't forget! The test is changing in June 2009 - don't get caught with an old study guide!"
2,There has to be better alternatives,"I would recommend anyone interested in this book first read a chapter or two in a bookstore as I did. The writing style of this author is unbelievably off-putting. As other have mentioned, the style is arrogant, patronizing, and amazingly condescending. I am looking elsewhere as I am not going to give any financial reward to to this author with my purchase. Clearly, based on other reviews, some readers are not offended by this style and if you can get past it, or it doesn't bother you, I'm certain the book will cover the material you need to pass the exam. As for me, I'm going to look at Andy Crowe's book as it seems to get good reviews without the offensiveness of Mulcahy's style."
3,"not good for preparing for PMP exam, try something else",this book is very confusing and hard to understand. It is written from a scientific point of view. I used an exam simulation program at pmsimulation.com and passed the PMP exam. This worked so much better than studying from a book.
1,The vampire diaries,This story is ok but I have read much better. I actually don't like the Elena character much in this story which is weird for a main character. Stick with the tv show- much better story lines and characters. Save your money get it from the library if you really want to read it
5,I liked IT!!!!,It was cool!! I like Elena and Stefan!! I hate Damon. I liked the story and characters... This book is the best one of the series.
4,Reading with Tequila,"I'm really getting into The Vampire Diaries, despite my initial misgivings with The Awakening. I really like how this story is turning out. I like how all of the characters' motivation is so clear, at least it seems to be. I can't wait to find out what happens with Stephen, Damon and Elena. I'm also really enjoying Bonnie's ability. The evilness of Caroline and Tyler brings a normal problem to a supernatural situation and I felt that worked very well.The Struggle had a better sense of finality than The Awakening. It feels like a full story, left slightly open-ended to allow for another book to follow. Instead of being separate books in a series, these books seem like all parts of the same book. I read this book immediately after The Awakening and it seems as though these books are best read one right after the other."
3,---,"A bit better than the first, and I liked how it started up exactly where the first book left off. It didn't reintroduce characters, which I like because reintroductions are annoying.But until I reached the last twenty or so pages, I had been wondering when something was going to happen or if the story was just going to drop off into nothingness in preparation for the third installment. Thankfully there is closure right at the end, so keep going even though it seems like nothing is happening.The dramatic parts are still short of exciting. There needs to be more description before, during, and after these events, because at times I was confused at how Stephan would be one place and suddenly another. At other times the action was just too pathetic and I was rolling my eyes instead of craving to read more.So again, decent story, but needs a lot more backbone."
2,Attempt to return was rejected,"Bought the software to use with an 851 router. The router software was so ridiculously buggy, I never even bothered to open or install the VPN client software. Just returned the router (for a full and complete refund - thank you Amazon).However, the VPN client return was completely rejected by the vendor Galactics, since it didn't have the original (non-Cisco) box. The CD was never removed from the sleeve, and the protection label never disturbed, so it should have at the worst received a restocking fee. Will never do business with Galactics again."
2,Arrived damaged.,"I read reviews about other compact refrigerators arriving damaged because of poor packaging through amazon, and I thought I wouldn't mind a couple of dents in it as long as it functioned correctly. I got this for my dorm room and it would have been the perfect compact fridge... if it worked. When the package arrived, it was ripped up in several places and there were stains along one side. I opened it and found 4 slim pieces of styrofoam supporting it. It turns out the stains were from leakage through the cooler because it got all over my floor. Now I have a huge mess to clean too. I'm sure I would have loved it if it worked because it could fit a lot, and would have been perfect for several quarts of milk and a waterfilter along with a few bottles and cans."
5,Fun for the whole family,My 5 yr old daughter's favorite book. The focus is alliteration. Each letter is originally illustrated and has an interesting description.
3,Pretty fast read.,"This is definitely not one of Brown's best works, but still manages to hold your attention because of the fast pace of the book.I felt it had a lot of references to her earlier works, and somehow lacking in originality. Also, the ending was too insipid and boring, no great suspence or mystery in this one."
5,Terrific!!!!!!,"Thumbs Up!!! I loved The Switch. It was fast paced, suspenseful and full of surpises I had not expected. I could not put the book down (those are the best kind). The characters were awesome; I felt so involved in Gillian and Melina Lloyd's life. I love all of Sandra Brown's novels. She's a wonderfully gifted writer (who also happens to have my maiden name)! I can't wait for the next one!"
2,Once again disappointed,I have been a huge Sandra Brown fan over the years but have been greatly disappointed by her last couple of books. I remember when I could not put one of her books down but with The Standoff and The Switch I had to struggle to finish the book. Where is the Sandra Brown of old?
4,Suspenseful,"I have been a big fan of Sandra Brown for years and I have read most of her books. If you like her recent books best--if you thought ""Unspeakable"" was one of her best then you will like ""Switched"". The romantic tension between the main characters was very good. The story line was definitely suspenseful, full of twists and turns. Although I was able to figure out one of the surprises early on, I still couldn't put this book down. Really a four and one half star book and a must read."
4,The Title Tells It All :),"Somewhat predictable, but the characters and storyline keep your interest.As children, identical twins, Gillian and Melina Lloyd, loved to switch places....it was fun and they wanted to try it as adults for one last time.....it turned out that this switch was a deadly idea.Patients at the Waters Fertility Clinic some how ended up murdered or had their children kidnapped/stolen after birth.Gillian Lloyd's murder after visiting the clinic for artificial insemination makes the police and her family become suspicious that there is more going on at the clinic than it appears.Love, lust, murder, revenge, and deceit all wrapped up into one. :)ENJOY!!"
1,Don't bother...,"I read every single page until I reached 350 and then I read the last five pages to see if what I assumed from the very beginning were true, and I was right. I knew from the beginning that Melina was the one murdered because Brown referred to her as ""she"" through most of the book. Only when I got to the middle did she start to write ""Melina"". It was silly that Gillian drove to Melina's house to spend the night. Hart was not much of a character. I can't comment on the entire book because I was so bored with it, I didn't finish it. And usually I will force myself to finish it whether I want to or not, but this one was taking way too long to get to the end. I was bored from the beginning. However, I won't give up on Brown. She is a fantastic author and many of her books are wonderful. Many of them I can't put down. However, compared to her other work, this book was probably written in the space of a few days. Not very well thought out."
1,who switched the author,I waited for this book all summer because of the author. The book was a monumental disappoinment. Sandra Brown's other books such as Alibi and Unspeakable were great. The Switch has inane plot with a terriibly simple premise. The plot is so trite and improbable that it is beyond description. I recommnending strongly passing on this book and switch to a new author such as Clancy or Margolin.
2,Another Brown disappointment,"I have loved Sandra Brown's books in the past, although her two most recent attempts have left me wanting more. This book continues to disappoint. I skippped through much of it because Brown did not flesh out the characters enough to make me care about them. I thought they were boring. I did not care about them, and there was hardly any romance. I didn't understand why they even wanted to be together. I hate to beat up on Ms. Brown because I cherish her earlier books and often reread them. I do understand she is writing more mainstream fiction now and when I read the plot on the book jacket it sounded excitng, but it ended up a lackluster waste of money."
2,Not one of her best...,"I've read nearly all of Sandra Browns books and have always enjoyed them. Great writing, well-paced plots, great romance and wonderful characters. So I was very disappointed in Ms. Brown's latest offering: The beginning was very clunky, the characters were flat and -- unlike Brown's previous novels -- their personal histories and the interactions between them were very poorly developed. There really was no mystery to the plot at any point, making this poorly written tale rather tedious to read. Was this realllllly the Sandra Brown whose stories I have loved so much?"
3,Avenge through Revenge,"The story of identical twin sisters, both beautiful, young & smart, but exact opposites. One is a responsible career woman, while her sister is the renegade wild child. When one twin is murdered after a secret night of passion with an astronaut, who is regarded as a national hero, the other will stop at nothing to find the truth & avenge her sister's death, even if exacting revenge means breaking the law. An enjoyable, fast-paced read."
1,Wish I switched to another book earlier.,"Boring, predictable and excrutiatingly difficult to get through. Come on, Sandra, the past has proven that you can do better than this."
4,Please read before considering harmful drugs,"Breggin is a genius in my opinion. He knows all too well the detrimental effects of psychiatric drugs on the human body, mind and spirit.Psychiatrists and doctors are much too quick to hand out drugs that don't FIX ""disorders"" such as PA, GAD, insomnia, etc. They seem more interested in getting patient's in and out of their office's quickly rather than taking the time to deal with and get to the root of the real problem(s) which are usually fear-based issues.No drug on the face of this earth ever CURED anyone of anxiety, panic, insomnia...Breggin points this out and gives good information on alternative therapies."
4,A little bit of perspective please!,"I found this book to be important and fascinating as a clinical social worker, wife, mother and friend. Obviously psychotropic meds can and are helpful for a number of disorders which need addressing. However, it appears that we as a society have become totally hooked on the idea that everything from anxiety to pre-menstrual syndrome can and should be alleviated with medication. And don't get me started on the number of children being prescribed psychotropic medications for all kinds of things. Do we even prepare people for the fact that it is nearly impossible to wean from these drugs without horrendous side effects? These are the most prescribed medications in America today. We really need to take a look at this and develop more holistically based alternatives."
4,Grinder,Nice item that lives up to it's reputation. Easy to assemble side hold handle and relatively easy to change disks out with tool provided.
1,Reviews are for wrong film,The four reviews shown here describe the 1981 movie directed by LingYun not the 1989 movie directed by Tommy Fan (Faan Sau Ming)!Check out the entries for this title on IMDB and the Hong Kong Movie Database!
5,Greek Charming is a good family movie.,I had watched Geek Charming on the Disney channel. It is a good movie for family viewing. There aren't enough of these. I have no interest in watching the other movie though.
5,A great tribute to Howard,"Conan was always one to protect the helpless. He never killed for the sake of killing, but had no qualms about dispatching anyone who was an enemy. Attack one of his own, though and you are in trouble. Kern is such a man. Loyal to a fault, able to overcome his fears and loved by his brother Cimmerians, he is a great succesor to Conan. A stranger among his kin, with his white hair and golden eyes, he is like Conan in a way as Conan was a stranger among Aquilonians, who he became king of, Kern is a great leader.The setting of the story is Cimmeria in the time of Conan the King, who is mentioned in the book. If we are lucky he will make an appearance in future volumes. I will not spoil it, but suffice it to say, Cimmeria has a new hero! I can hardly wait to read Volume 2!"
3,rubbing elbows,Good history of days gone by in a place near where I lived in Southeren Florida.Most of the places i frequented and rubbed elbows with hoods and goons and didn't even know it
4,Agiltiy book review,"This is a good book to develop quick feet and agility. The only disappointing chapter was the one on dot drills. I would have liked a few more drills rather than make the letters and numbers. Otherwise it is great for cones, hurdles, and agility ladders. Good purchase!"
5,Review of The Scalpel's Edge,"Concise,well-written and highly readable, this book has rapidly become an underground classic for surgical residents. It addresses issues of vital concern to those contemplating surgery for themselves or their relatives."
4,Soft and Warm but Hard for Mom,"The Swaddle Me Traveler is very soft and warm. My only complaint is that it's a little difficult to get a squirmy baby into. It was a little hard to get his legs in the leg holes and then put him in the car seat, strap him in, and then wrap him the rest of the way into the swaddle. I didn't use it as much as I might have because it wasn't always as easy as I would like. But in the end it wasn't that hard to use and when I did bother to wrap my baby into it he was comfortable and I was happy with it."

4,Biggest MuDvAyNe fan ever speaks the truth about the new cd,"O.K. im gonna be as honest as i can.With 2 of the greatest albums behind them,BOATTE and L.D.50,i was expecting the world from this album.But i only got a country.Dont get me wrong its a great album and all but its not mudvayne at their best,if you wanna buy a ...c.d. by L.D.50.If your more into singing than screaming by TEOATTC.Actually buy em both.But make sure you get the cd with the DVD cause 2 of the best songs are on that disc."
5,Wow,"After hearing all of LD 50, I wouldnt have expected something like this. Has its heavy points, but is overall a softer, more mature and equally creative album. If you liked LD 50, you shouldnt be disappointed, if you havent heard these guys, check it out. Tracks:Silenced: 5/5Trapped in the Wake of a Dream: 3.5/5Not Falling: 5/5(Per)Version of a Truth: 3.5/5Mercy, Severity: 5/5World So Cold: 5/5the patient mental: 4/5Skrying: 4/5Solve Et Coagula: 4/5Shadow of a Man: 5/512:97:24:99: 11 seconds of silence, was there really a point to this?End of All Things To come: 4/5Key To Nothing: 3.5/5Overall good CD, suprising"
4,Beautiful,"I think that people writing these negative reviews need to realize that as artists who are particularly good in their field, they have the right to experiment. Maybe they didnt want to follow up with an LD 50 2, huh? Maybe they wanted to make some music that was just a tad bit more melodic. They are artists. They make music for themselves just as much as they make music for their fans."
5,Mudvayne has released a cd better than LD 50? yes they have,"When i first heard ""Not Falling"" i wasnt sure if i liked it, but once i heard it again i was hooked. That was my reaction with most of this cd, dont go in expecting LD 50 and you will end up satisfied if not more. This is a much more mellow album but will not dissapoint those who like heavier music because it is still there just not in large quantaties. It is very much like the transition between Disturbed's ""The Sickness"" and ""Beleive"". If you werent overly dissapointed by ""Beleive"" than it should be the same here, even though this is much better than both Disturbed cds. Lets just face it, Mudvayne is here to stay and thats a good thing."
1,Mudvayne Sold Out!,This CD is much worse than L.D. 50 i don't know what the other people are talking about it is better. Yeah it evolved it evolved into crapy trendy music. They are trying to be something they are not. Mudvayne was the last hope for metal with this slipknot/stone sour & murderdolls and Machine Head selling out we had nothing.
5,THIS CD IS AWESOME!,THIS IS DEFINITELY MUDVAYNE'S BEST CD YET! I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO EVERYONE. THEIR BASS PLAYER IS AWESOME! THIS IS DEFINITELY A CD EVERYONE SHOULD OWN.
3,Not durable enough,"Bought thèse for my toddler. Worked great, but developed holes in both shoes after being worn once à week for 3 months. Should last longer at this price!"
1,What the...?,"I was walking though a store one day and saw this game. Since I LOVED the first Red Faction I figured this game would be right up my alley. So I bought it... brought it home... installed it. NO MULTIPLAYER!? NOT EVEN LAN!? Lemme tell you... a FPS without a multiplayer option is like a bathroom without a toilet. If you are a person that plays FPSs for the multiplayer (as I do), do yourself a favor and skip this game. With so many better games out there including Counter Strike 1.6/Condition Zero/Source, Day of Defeat, Half Life 1 & 2, Far Cry, Battlefield Vietnam/1942, and Unreal (and I'm sure you'll be able to think of TONS more) you should just save your money and just keep playing the first Red Faction. Heck... even the original DOOM/DOOM 2/Final DOOM for PC had at least a multiplayer LAN option. THQ... what we're you thinking when you made this game?"
2,Red Faction II,"I like action games, but this one is really from the older generation. Most likely it should be filed in a shelf and played when really bored!"
3,Red Faction Left Me Seeing Red,"The game on the medium setting was a good challenge even for a seasoned gamer such as myself. The final battle for the game was a huge pain -- enough to make me play something else until I was ready to give it another go.The in-game tutorial was a little fuzzy on things you were supposed to do. Also, while the game is linear -- it didn't do well leading you through the missions. I often started missions not knowing which way to go and getting bombarded an infinate spawing of troops which led to my demise on several accounts.While overall it was a good game; it was a short game -- my Amazon account still hasn't updated that it was delivered yet. I completed it in under 12 hours of game play, and I believe I am being generous. If I had spent more money on the game than I had, I would have felt really cheated when I finished -- so it was a good buy for the price.I was happy and suprised that Red Faction 2 worked on Windows 7 after a patch and an exe fix."
4,Great!,"It is pretty great having Ghibli music to listen to all the time with such a unique feel! I love it!Nothing replaces the original obviously but it's still great quality, very relaxing and utterly enjoyable. :)"
4,Surprisingly good!,I can't believe this movie didn't get more recognition. It's an excellent WWII film and I throughly enjoyed it. Nice combet sequences and decent storyline.
2,Too intimate to be considered 'epic',"DARK BLUE WORLD[Tmavomodr Svet](Czech Republic/UK/Germany/Denmark/Italy - 2001)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Hawk Scope)Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital Surround EX1939: Two Czech fighter pilots (Ondrej Vetch and Krystof Hádek) flee the Nazi occupation of their homeland and travel to England, where they join the RAF and are torn apart by their mutual love of a lonely young woman (Tara Fitzgerald).Despite its ravishing widescreen visuals and glorious aerial combat sequences, Jan Sverák's wartime melodrama is a little too restrained for its own good, even when the two main characters become divided by Vetch's unethical behavior. Performances are solid, but Sverák's intimate direction works against the film's epic sweep, and the result is neither one thing or another. Hádek looks like a Bel Ami porn beauty, which is a huge plus, and Charles Dance makes a brief appearance in the role of a pompous RAF commander."
4,Great Lesson on How to Use Digital Effects,"All the positive reviews are accurate. One aspect that especially struck me, however, was the restrained yet powerful use of digital special effects. For the most part, everything looked real -- mainly because the director didn't overdo it. In fact, I didn't even realize how much digital imagery there was until I watched the special features on the DVD.If digital effects are done right, WWII has a great future in the movies. If they're overdone, or done shabbily, then those of us who want the brave men who fought the war to be honored have nothing to look forward to except Bruckheimerized garbage."
1,Displeased,I didn't think I was buying a toy...the glass lens are loose and the magnification is less than useful..Had I known it was a toy I would not have bought it..
4,Very complete except for technical information on hubs.,"Would highly recommend this book as a first time purchase, is excellent as far as technical information as to building the wheel, but lacks specific information about building and turning the hub for the wheel."
2,I would pass on this book,"This book is a two volume set in one book. Unless I was learning to be a wheelwright using 19th century technology (Volume 1 - first half of the book) or was learning to be a wheelwright using 19th century technology (Volume 2 - a large part of the lead in to Vol 2 is a condensed version of the data from Vol 1) I would not recommend this book. Vol 2 does go into the building of wagon bodies and fith wheels which could be of use to modelers or restorers, but having said that, I think there are much better sources for primary data available for general wagon construction.This book is a reprint of information published over 100 years ago.As an historical reference to ""how it was done back in the day"", the book is interesting. Depending on what you would need the infomation for, this could be a very good reference. For my needs, I found it lacking."
3,almost really good,"This is fashioned after The jean Van Hemme comic series. And that was lifted from a book but embellished into separate issues. Bourne flix work the same story. This version suffers from TV ism which is too bad because Dorff makes a strong Xlll and people are pretty good overall. But the shots are wrong. Just poor cinematography which makes everything flat & overall predictable. The sequencing is low key, with no tension. The weird sepia tones add ziltch to the story. That was sort of a fad to make everything brown. All the same. Doesn't do much when you want to build suspense. Scenes don't end making a statement but jerk into the next one. It gives the plot away twice killing any chance at suspence. That is just poor scripting. But you get the idea which is a good one and could be great if only..."
5,Rainbow Chronicles,"""Rainbows light sky and earth. Can they join people, animals, and shape-shifters to steward the planet? Different narrators tell the Earthens story in twelve Rainbow Chronicles, each light-filled high fantasies with a contemporary American twist, global perspective, and cosnis attitude for middle-graders and adults."" Sounds rather new age-ish to me."
2,I recommend to change the title what CRM looks like.,"I have got this book with big hopes. I did not expect a magical touch to understand what CRM is, it was much lower than my expectations. Especially the jargon throughout the book makes it difficult to read."
5,the book to have for Pilot job seekers,"This book goes beyond the average ""job hunting"" book.It explains in Detail the specific steps to be hired as a pilot.I would buy it again."
3,Duel in the Sun- Soundtrack,"One of the best soundtracks from the '40's. Although credit is not given, it sounds like the original Boston Pops recording. Unfortunately, recording technology of the period leaves much to be desired. Still, I treasure it."
1,Weapons of Legacy book,"Great! Thanks so much for your great price, great shipping, and integrity.I got this for my grandson who is pleased as ever!"
2,weapons of legacy shows how inflation hurts,this book is a deffinat doin't waste your timeit features items that grow in power over time butalso handy cap the character toosuch as by taking skill points / hit points/ penalties to hit etcmaking the weapon impracticle later on at higher levelsor to dangerious to have at mid levelsand the new rules reguarding such items were not so detailed orgrand that they couldn't have added it to one of thier lessor sources without creating a hard back rule book for itthe only redemming factor is the mini adventures that accompany each item with write ups on thier verious current locals/owners
4,"""Caddy"" yes, ""drainer"" no.","It doesn't make a good drainer as the liquid has nowhere to go but as I didn't purchase it for that purpose, I'm okay with that. It's an attractive caddy and a good alternative to the traditional space sucking flatware tray."
3,Quilt how to book,"Easy to follow directions and good pictures, but I am not fond of the results. fabric selection is very difficult and I am not a fan of not knowing what the quilt will look like!"
3,too big...rubbers,"These Tingley rubbers are larger than the ones I usually buy. I like to buy them locally, but they are not easy to find. So I bought them on line, and these were way larger. So I am back to searching for them."
2,Rubber shoes,The rubber shoes are extremely difficult to put on over the shoes.We ended up cutting a slice in the top.
5,Great fit and does the job,"I bought a pair of these two years ago to wear over my work boots when going to the horse stable, and I am still using them. They fit very nicely over any boots or shoes, and they keep them dry during the Winter and Spring here in the Midwest. Very easy to clean--when I get them muddy, I just rinse them off. They are also easier to get on than the tall overshoe equivalents."
5,Very Entertaining!,"Moon Over Hong Kong was great fun. Silly ? But of course. The music really added a lot and I was very mesmerized by Peter Michaels ( who plays the recruiting officer) and his persona. All and all this is super fun if you don't take this world and yourself too seriously. You do see quite a bit of Hong Kong and glimpses of New York in the rain. Then two night clubs a sleazy porn theater, streets, secret meeting places to hand over a secret assignment where the men are a bit more then meets the eye. It has a definite ""out of the box"" feeling and at the same time I sensed a desire by the film makers to borrow and steal as much from the traditional Hollywood spy genre as much as possible, this dichotomy of being an out of the box product and trying to borrow from the most traditional source and mix the two is to my opinion what gives Moon Over Hong Kong it's charm."
5,Great Scale especially for the price,"We priced and tested many scales. We saw this on Amazon and thought it looked like a pretty good scale. Well, we received it about it 3 days ago and let me say for the price we don't think you could find a better scale. It is made well and accurate (if you stand on it correctly). And for those over 40 the dial is easy to see even without glasses. :) So if you looking for a good scale at a reasonable price you can't go wrong with this one. While it is not the cheapest scale you can buy, it is does offer good quaility and is offered at a good price. (We paid $29.99)."
2,Mediocre translation and mediocre poetry,"Tasso's wonderful story of adventure and romance is rendered poorly by translator Esolen. While everyone realizes that prose translation is a difficult task, when the literature is written originally in meter, the task becomes daunting. Should the translator attempt to capture the meter of the poetry -- the song -- and give less attention to a strict rendering of the words? Or should the translator render the story as accurately as possible and be less concerned with the ""song""?Esolen has chosen a middle road strategy that leads to both a mediocre rendering of the story and a mediocre use of English poetry to capture the song. Esolen's translation reads slowly and has a many, awkward, stilted, English rhymes. I would advise potential readers to seek another translation."
4,Shucks! This book is the best!,I must admit that I was skeptiacal at first when I saw Mr. Wernick's book on this here wesite. But by Job! He done a great job. This is a good'un. I erspeicllay liked the way he explains all the ailements of playin bluegrass. In just three weeks I was playin and hootin and hollerin with the kinfolk. You should just go out and buy this book. You here?
4,A good book for the beginning Banjo player,"I have a couple of Pete's video courses, and have spent a good bit of time on his website. The man knows his stuff when it comes to banjo, and is a good teacher. This is a worthwhile book. One thing as mentioned by another reviewer is that the tabs are handwritten and the fret numbers are above the strings instead of on them as is now the custom. I bought my copy used for a few dollars and it did not have the cd or record with it which was not stated in the description. However, I mainly was buying it to add to my collection of banjo books as a reference so it was not a big deal."
2,And some not,"While ""lost souls"" had the unmistakable feeling of secretly discovering forgotten objects and finding traces of urban structures in the middle of a desolate summer field with your best friend while sharing chocolates from a lesser known ex-soviet republic, ""some cities"" has the feeling of your friend coming over to play gamecube and later call up people on the speakerphone seeing what's up, what's happening, maybe hooking up.The evocative splendor of appropriately lined tracks 1 to 6 of ""lost souls"" is nowhere to be found here, yet is replaced by the efforts to sustain it of tracks 7 to 12, but with more giving up and less trying.Is this a really bad album, does it deserve TWO stars? Well no, not if you don't rate it compared to it's first-most predecessor."
4,Doves Haven't Forgotten Themselves,"Doves have released three albums that are all quite different from each other, but nearly equal in quality all-around. With ""Some Cities,"" Doves seem to be taking a more direct approach to the music. And why shouldn't they? They meandered enough musically on the last two fantastic albums. This album is tighter and more concise than earlier work, and upon first listen you might think this album is devoid of any excitement. But keep listening, and you'll begin to realize that you've been had. Despite taking a more direct and tighter approach, this album stills sounds big and bright and expansive. That's a very weird feat to accomplish sounding both smaller and more refined AND expansive at the same time. That makes ""Some Cities"" a wonderful addition to Doves' catalogue, and one of the best records of 2005."
4,"The best , most consistent effort - less groove more GUITARS","I've always liked the DOVES singles, but had trouble with their often hit-or-miss full-length albums - frequently, they mistake texture/atmosphere/groove for good songwriting - now comes their third CD, and it's an absolute killer from the first track to the last - chock of full chiming guitars, wall-of-sound sonics, and hummable hooks, this is their least ""dance"" album yet, but ironically by far their best - how can you deny the instantly addictive rock rush of the title track, Black & White Town, Sky Starts Falling, Snowden, and more - this is how radio show sound; pity it doesn't, unless you listen to Indie 301 or KCRW."
3,Ok can be fun,"I received this a few years back and gave it to my daughter so we now play it every x-mas eve, being x-mas story fans that we are. The game would be better if they came up with something else to charge you for besides rent, buying houses and motels, it seems half monopoly and half Christmas story."
3,Good movie,"I bouht this when I was in Iraq, I like it but it was not that great! enough to keep me entertained in Iraq!"
3,A strange book,"I had loved Palliser's ""The Quincunx"" and ""Betrayals"", but found that books far less interesting and original. One couldn't recognize Palliser's style... However, the way he depicts a cold, indifferent Northern city (probably Glasgow) and its inhabitants is interesting."
4,"The essential primer on surfing, told with insite and style.","Kampion is the best at describing and explaining surfing and surf culture. I was transported through the years and distances of my own life, flashing on classic images and the well thought out perspective that the book offers. If you ever wondered where your watery roots originated and why it is the way it is, check out Stoked."
3,"Revisionist Historians Everywhere, Cringe!","I don't like revisionist historians. You know, the nutjobs that say the Holocaust isn't real. This film kicks them squarely in the balls by proposing Franklin Roosevelt got polio from a werewolf bite. It only gets weirder from there. I didn't particularly like the comedy of the film, but I appreciate the obvious passion that went into making this odd little bit of cinema. There wasn't a big budget, but there's a vast abundance of heart in this movie. If you want a movie to kick back and watch with a few friends and a few drinks, and you're not too strict on how the events of World War II are depicted, grab this title and prepare to have a good time."
3,Great hardware poor software,"This is a fantastic piece of hardware, but the software bundled with it is rather disappointing - the download manager doesn't work as well as it should (won't download very large files, often won't show a reason why your torrent isn't downloading, etc.), it restarts the whole system whenever you change the smallest setting (e.g. you enable torrent seeding, it disables all your wireless network, reenables it after a few seconds). Also, I was unable to rename the default volume and share - it seems they have to be named ""MYVOLUME1"" and ""MYSHARE1"". Was also unable to delete files from it without enabling user-level authentication.I'm really looking forward to installing OpenWRT on this, then it'll be a great system."
3,Almost very good,"Galgut is great at setting a mood and establishing a sense of place. But where this book falls apart is in the area of characterization. The people in this book do things and I wasn't sure why and to be honest, I didn't really care. I guess this is a writer of great promise - all the reviews said so - but to me, The Good Doctor was just something I did instead of watching tv for a couple of evenings."
4,Lid/top needs improvement.,"I agree with the other review that the top is hard to seat correctly and becomes almost impossible once any oil from the dressing gets on the soft seal. I bought this to replace the Good Seasons cruet which I felt also always had a less than perfect sealing cap. Otherwise, love the polycarbonate bottle."
2,Where was the proof reader?,"I read this book mainly because I went to school with Sam Consiglio (the book is about Sam) and the author lived down the street from me. The book is very poorly written as far and grammar, spelling and in some cases even the character are mixed up by name. I am amazed that a lot of the crimes were commited so close to where I lived and I was never aware of any of it. It was an interesting read in the fact that this man got away with so much before actually finally getting a conviction. I also wonder what actually is true and what actually is fiction? This book has surely peaked the interest in my fellow classmates that have connect on facebook."
1,really sucks,This is the worst parady I have ever seen. No one can be that stupid! Don't rent it! I got a headache 20 minutes in and had to stop watching it. what were they thinking and the writers should be shot.
1,"Really, Why?","Why would someone make this movie? Waste of money, time, and it hurt my brain. Now I'm going to watch some old Bill Nye shows so I can be happy with myself again."
2,Dated Survey of Contemporary Artists,"Though dated, the book contains a historically relevant survey of contemporary artists. Each artist gives a short explanation of their work. Makes a great reference model for artists seeking ideas for the difficult task of describing their own work. Collectors will appreciate the listings to check the backgrounds of artists. Color as well as black and white pictures are spread throughout the book and give the words a visible reference."
3,I don't know if this works at all,"I don't really have a mood problem, so I don't know whether this drug is actually meant for me. I got it because I read that it was good to elevate mood. I can't say that my mood was ""more elevated"" than without this drug. I noticed one day that I would smile super often, however, I had a really good reason to be happy to begin with! I'm certain I would normally have smiled all day in that situation. I cant say definitively that I think this works, which means that you might not want to expect too much when you take this. Then again, how many people get duped by placebos?"
2,Uncomfortable.,"Just don't feel comfortable in this item. The material isn't very giving. Cost is prohibitive, also, so think twice before buying."
4,Stooges at their Zaniest,"Of all the Stooges movies this is my personal favorite. It is well-made and contains lots of gags and lots of Stooges. And the storyline, which takes the Stooges around the world, isn't that bad either."
