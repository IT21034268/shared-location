4,Travel Time Jess,"I love these watches in style and use. Only one complaint.... the mesh band cracked and broke the wiring which damaged one of my favorite travel jackets. Other than that band problem, it is perfect for my use and looks great on my wrist."
1,looks wonderful....,"but when i went to use it i found that the handle has a problem... since this was at an airport it was not a good thing... it seems that the hole to make the handle go ""click"" when it is extended does not allow the handle to then retract... since i've got it home i have fixed the problem, but really, this shows some shoddy workmanship and quality contro;... won't be buying from american tourister again"
3,THE SOUND OF SUMMER,"If there's any artist who exemplifies disco, it would certainly be the late Donna Summer. From the mid-seventies through the early eighties, the disco diva dominated the airwaves and dance floors around the world.This 80s compilation consists of the radio-edit versions of some of her biggest hits. Summer had a dynamic voice and proved she could do more than grunt and breathe heavy. Her musical accompaniment was also strong--we lose some of this in the shortened versions. This 10 track collection affirms Summer's success was more focused on dancing than being great songs, with the possible exception of SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY, the video-friendly paen to the working woman and her powerful cover of Jimmy Webb's MACARTHUR PARK.Donna Summer remains iconic to disco but you have to like disco to fully appreciate her contribution."
1,thursday's child,Thursday's ChildThis wonderful made for television movie has long been out of print. The quality of this DVD version is very disappointing. It seems it has been made from an old video copy. The color is poor and the video seems out of focus at times. This could not have been mastered from an original source. Too bad as this is a great movie.
4,Correction...,"I had previously commented that the product was not as described, which upon rereading the description was not correct. In fact the description did indicate that a jewel case was not being sold with the product, odd but it was stated.My apologies."
1,Wrong Edition,"The description clearly stated that it was the Sixth Edition that I was purchasing, but I was sent the Fifth Edition which is significantly different. It also took a very long time for it to arrive. I had to cancel the workbook I ordered with it, as even thought I had ordered it in advance it still had not arrived 3 weeks into the school term. The return process appears to be simple, so if I get a timely refund I would give them the one star credit for that. I also have to say this is the first time I have been disappointed by Amazon. I have received good service here in the past, and won't be signing off on them for one bad order."
1,One star is one star too many....,"Out of all counseling and psychotherapy books avilable, this Corey book is the WORST!!! Corey exemplifies dead level abstractions all through out this book. This book wasn't even good for heurestic value...it made no sense. HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!"
4,This text has become an essential counseling theory work.,"Corey's text is an essential text for those wishing to enter the counseling/therapy field. It is well-written, easily accepted by students, and covers the most important psychological theories in mental health. There has been an expansion of the family therapies chapter and chapters on ethics and counselor characteristics are outstanding. This book is used throughout Counselor Education and Mental Health training. I recommend it highly as the best overview for beginning and graduate students in the helping field."
1,An awful book,"I have had little choice but to utilize this book during my graduate studies in psychology, and just emailed the university staff.From all my books during undergraduate and graduate studies, this book is by far the worst I have had to use to-date. It is very unclear, vague, badly organized, and oftentimes does not offer complete listings or definitions in neither text or index. I am very disappointed, and therefore recommend that its usage be avoided wherever possible. You are guaranteed to incur high levels of frustration!"
5,Been to airports and back,"My 21"" Ilite (available for under $90.00) has crossed the Atlantic twice (along with multiple trips IAD-Honolulu, IAD-LAX, IAD-ORD). This carry-on iLite functioned well (spacious; wheels rolled smoothly; the iLite has several handles which provided grips for lifting into overhead compartment). On several flights, I chose to check in the luggage, and the iLite's blue shell provided much easier identification in a sea of black luggages. When scuff marks on the blue iLite showed, soapy water and a toothbrush provided the clean-up solution. This iLite is holding its own and has more miles to fly."
2,Scholar Book,"Not your average common read, needs an amplified version for people like me who just don't get it. I was very bored with the reading however pressed my way through"
2,Disappointed,"I have other Oxo items that I like very much, but these Stainless Steel Measuring Cups are a big disappointment. I also experienced the handle bending easily when packing in brown sugar. They will be in my next yard sale."
1,yin yang butterfly,This is my third attempt to notify a2zbktsintl how disappointed I am with the lack of response to my email. As noted before the book I ordered was to be hard bound and in good condition. What I received was a paper back book is very bad condition. I cannot believe this seller has five stars. I have never been disappointed with purchases from amazon.com and would like some sort of response. MJ Lowes My order number is 105-7572216
5,"You'll laugh, You'll Cry","Annie knows Stevie is ""full of the devil,"" but her mother (when she left home for good) got Annie to promise to ""take care of your brother."" If you've ever had to take care of a younger brother or sister, you'll feel like laughing--and often like crying--as you hear Annie tell her story. A short book, but full of emotions.The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
2,1001 Spoilers,"If you hate reading spoilers, don't read about any movie in this book unless you've seen it already. Duralde gives away FAR too much in his synopses, which are in my opinion completely unnecessary anyway. It is his commentaries that are the interesting element here, and motivate us to see the films. Why he chose to reveal plot turns, and thus needlessly deflate our enjoyment of the films is beyond me."
4,"Pretty good, but no 5 stars","If you've seen the movie, then you've basically read the book. They fit closely (Tidyman wrote the book and the movie screenplay), but there are a few differences. Shaft is a good character, with his own ideals and views of life. He's not quite as hard-boiled as other private investigators (Mike Hammer, Jack Hagee to name a few), but he has his moments.This book is a good read if you are a fan of mysteries, but especially if you like the private eye genre, then it's essential. Tidyman's description rivals other great authors of the genre, his dialoge reminds me of Elmore Leonard at times.The only thing that doesn't give this book the fifth star is that it has too many slow moments, and takes a while for the book to get going."
2,The Saboteurs,You can tell that this book was not written by W.E.B. Griffin alone. It is not his style of writing which is uniquite and holds you attentive so that you do not want to put it down. I was quite disappointed in the book.
1,What a Disappointment,"As a long time reader of Griffin, I would say this is his poorest by far. I have read and re-read the Corps and Men at War series several times and always feel warmed by the characters each time. I felt let down by this effort. I can only hope that Butterworthless wrote this while Dad was out of town. The characters are barely tollerable much less believable, the plot very loose and the ending should have taken another 200 pages. I really he hope he gets back on track."
2,Peter Thomson,"I'm a great fan of Griffin, but not a great fan of authors collaborating with others, even their family. It seems too much like wanting the sales without the sweat. In this case the plotting is good, but the flow, rythm and tricks of the trade that Griffin brings are lacking. It's proof once again how good Griffin's work is and how sadly in this book he is missed. Too bad."
1,sad and weak,Griffin has been one of my favorites for years. This book however is a sad disappointment from such a wonderful writer. Why did he even bother to publish it?Clumsy throughout it leads me to believe Griffin did not really write this book.
2,Going downhill,"Though I've enjoyed most of Griffin's earlier work, The Saboteurs is really pretty bad. These newer works of Griffin seem to be published without an editor ever having glanced at the pages. It seems that Griffin thinks as long as he can fill the pages with his alcoholic characters pouring drink after drink, his fans will continue to buy his work. That's it for me, I'll never buy another of his books.W.E.B., Truman wasn't sworn in as VP until January 20, 1945. Who's doing your research?"
1,Not Pleased,I was very disappointed when I received this bood to discover that it was not written by W.E.B. Griffin (William E. Butterworth) but was written by his son William E. Butterworth IV. I have really enjoyed W.E.B. Griffins writing style and couldn't even read this one as it was entirly different.
2,Griffin disappoints--Sack Son,"I was mightily disappointed in this latest book, purported to be written by my favorite author. Where did he go? The plot was improbable, disjointed. The characters were forgettable. The theme, Our Patriotic Mobsters And How They Helped Us Win The War, is only of mild interest. I should have known that something was wrong when I looked at the author's pictures: a pair of unhappy collaborators if I ever saw one! I hate looking for another author! Come back! Please!"
5,A Treat in Every Book,"I first saw these books (Love in Every Room, Down a Garden Path, and The Blessing of Friendship)in our church's bookstore several weeks ago. Every time I turned the pages it was like watching Anne of Green Gables or seeing pictures of Tasha Tudor's homestead--a treat for the eyes and the soul. The Scripture and symbolism contained within the pages creates, with the pictures and cute handwriting, some very beautiful and inspiring books.For a birthday gift or even a Christmas gift--for ANY woman, young or old, single, married, whatever--Karla's books are a blessing. I'm a young single woman who just received the three books mentioned above as a Christmas gift. Talk about a surprise blessing!"
1,Waste of money & time,"Throughly cleaned Bumpers with lacquer thinner and then with alcohol. Bumpers looked GREAT for three (3) days, then Forever Black began to pop off. Certainly NOT woth the money & time involved!"
3,It works as intended.,"It makes bumpers black and tires too, but sticks to paint, but won't die interior or exterior leather. The product just sits on top and can be scraped off. It sticks to the paint better than trim so be very careful."
2,Faulty Disk,Although the software works to clean up the hard disk. It is not useful to prevent unwanted spying on your Mac.
2,A Waste of Time,"The fact that I had to read it for class did not help me appreciate this book. I did not like the main character, Jonas, or any of the other characters. I was utterly bored, even with the few interesting pages this book provided. I did appreciate the messages that (my class and) I got out of this book (such as how differences are important). The ending, though some may enjoy being able to make up their own, annoyed me. I had many unanswered questions by the end of the book. It bothered me that Jonas, knowing the cruelty of his lifestyle and that there was a better place, would leave his impressionable sister there. Jonas is willing to save the baby, but not his own sister? Having read The Outsiders the year before (which I had enjoyed immensely) I had high hopes for this book. Reading this book made me return to my previous opinion that the teachers who choose which books the class is to read enjoy torturing their students."
4,The Giver,"The book I am writing about is named ""The Giver"". It is about a boy named Jonas, living in a Utopian world. This book is a good book because it is a different and weird community. This is a different community because they only celebrate your b-day up to 12 years, and the Elders pick your job for you. Jonas' community has bikes and no cars. When Jonas turns 12, he receives the job called the Receiver of Memory. After he gets it h wants to change the community. I think you should read this book because you get to read about a community that has weird rules and it is kind of a weird community."
2,Not so good...,"I felt the giver had ver interesting ideas, but they were expressed so slow and boring. It ruined a lot of the book."
4,Great Book that no one can miss,"In the 5th Grade I read THE GIVER with my class. It was a story that took a while to understand, but once you did you didn't want to put it down. The story is about a boy named Jonas living in a perfect society, no crime, no poverty, no nothing. He has no idea of his birth parents or siblings. All he knows is that from now on his life is living there and consuming the starnge job of Reciever. This is a kind of book where you have to be mature. There are a couple of parts that have to take a serious person to sit and read with no laughing. So, I strongly say to read this book"
3,"My Opinion Of ""The Giver""","Personally, I didn't really care for ""The Giver"". Yes, it is a good book, with a good plot, but what spoiled the book for me was the way the characters acted. When I read a book, I like to have more than one character be three-demensional. As I read this book, I grew increasingly fustrated at the behavior of the other characters actions. The only characters that seemed to have any remote form of demension were The Giver and Jonas. In my opinion, if the other characters that were mentioned on a regular basis, perhaps the book would have been more enjoyable to me. However since that was not the case, I cannot find too much that I enjoyed from this book."
3,"Interesting concept, but lacking in execution.","Taking a look into a possible future eutopia is always interesting. The writing style didn't really catch me, but the concept made me want to read on to see what would happen. An ok book, but I can imagine the conversations one could have with young adults while reading this book."
4,This was an enhancing story,"I did not actually READ this book. I listened to it on Cassette, but even so this book had me hanging till the end! It can be a little boring in the beginning and you have to be able to understand what is happpening in the characters world. This book gave us a little insight of what it may be like in the future. I found parts of this book a little disturbing and it sent me wondering about our world. If you read this book, be ready to ask questions and also give yourself time to figure out some what is happening. let the facts sink in. This book is a little complex, but I still loved it. [the casette was VERY good so if you do not like to read try listening to this book. I had seen this book at bookstores before but never took much intrest. Now that i listened to it i changed my mind.]"
3,The Giver,The Giver is written by Lois Lowry. The book is about a boy called jonas. he lives in a community where are very strikt ruels.for every year there are ceremonies. in the ceremonie of 12 jonas gets the Receiver of Memory.i find the book very interesting because it is very exciting and crazy. the book wasn't very difficult to read and understand.
5,The Giver - my first english book ;),"I think, that the book is very funny, because its an utopia ..But I got very sad, because I didn't understand a lot of words and I wasn't sure if i'm good enough in english .. because i thought, that this book was only for children .. and I have been learning english for 5 years and I thought, that I'm not good enough .. :(!But it was very nice to read that book, because i like those unrealistik thinks .."
2,not the best,"ok i can understand why this book got a newberry metal, it had a good plot and it is worth reading but i found that i didn't really like the characters and i thought that it was alittle too improbable even for a sci-fi book. as i said before you should get this book and it is worth reading at least to give you a new idea of what life might be like in the future."
2,Meh,"I had to read this book as part of a Young Adult literature class, and the attend a lecture by Lois Lowery. I can honestly say, that I wasn't that thrilled with the book. I felt like I'd read it before. I hadn't, but I read a book that had similar ideas that was written in 1938 by Ayn Rand entitled Anthem. Anthem takes place in the future, in a world where individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. All decisions are made by committees and individualism doesn't exist. Giver is essentially about a society that has eliminated pain and strife by converting to ""Sameness,"" a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives."
4,The Giver,"I read this book as a freshman in high school, which was last year. Most of the novels I wind up reading in English class wind up being boring or not to my interest, I thought it was going to be the same when my teacher handed it out to my class, but I was wrong this book kept me reading and reading as no book has before. I would have given it a 10 if not for alot of the parts of the book had me confused and I had to go back and read it over again. Overall I really enjoyed it and recommend it to all Freshmen. Thank You-Ryan Cox"
4,Exellent,I think this book was exellent it had so much power.This was a very interesting book because it had a way of getting you to think.I deffinetly would recommend a part 2 for the story.
4,"Imaginative and thought provoking, but lacking detail.",The Giver is entertaining. It makes you think about moral and philosophical questions. However I feel that many of the characters' personalities were not explored enough. The ending also left too many loose ends and did not give enough closure.
4,The Giver,"The GiverThe Giver is a very well thought out, original novel. Written by Lois Lowry, it is filled with interesting ideas in every chapter. It's a pretty simple read but with a sci-fi feel. It's hard to know if it took place in the future or the past. When I read it, I was full of questions as was the main character Jonas. At the beginning, Jonas is an 11 year-old boy with unique qualities unlike any of his friends or family. When Jonas attends the annual assignment ceremony, he has no idea what job he will receive for the rest of his life, but he could never imagine the one that he is selected for. All in all, The Giver is a remarkable one of a kind book and I highly recommend it."
3,great book,One of my favorite parts is when they go elsewhere. It is a good book but it gets a little boring. I wish she would have had a longer ending.
1,The Giver was not good literature,"The Giver was not good literature because it wasn't full of feelings, there was not interesting details, and there was not a surprise ending. The Giver was not full of feelings because Johanas' community had no feelings. Also there was nothing to explain if there were no emotions. Another reason why The Giver was not good literature is because there were no interesting details. Nothing was really explained in The Giver. Also in the interesting parts the author didn't really go into detail. Lastly, The Giver was not good literature is because there was not a surprise ending. The ending of The Giver was horrible. The last words of the whole story were ""But perhaps it was only an echo."" That is why The Giver was not good literature."
3,BORING,I had to read this book in my english lessons!My opinion of this book is that it is very boring because many parts are difficult to read (I'm from Germany)!There is no action in this book! The topic is very interesting but its too short and there are not enough descriptions about the community and there history!The Open-end is a big mistake. I want to know how does the story ends!An other penalty point is that the story is written in a long-winded way.This book could be better.
4,The Giver,I liked this book because it was unlike any other book I have ever read! The story is about a boy that grows up and helps his community. Some of the reasons I liked this book are that the setting is in the future and some of the ways of life that they had were prety funny to me. I recommend this book for ages 10 through adulthood.
3,It started well...,"I realy liked the beginning of this book. As it goes on, however, it begins to get slightly repetative and than has one of the worst endings I have ever read.I recomend this book if you don't have anything else to read,all in all it was OK."
4,Excellent read for youth and adults alike!,"A friend's daughter was required to read this book for school, and the mom was so struck by it she gave it to me. It is haunting, compelling, hard to put down. A lot to think about. This book should make us question where we are going and also make us take a hard look at the past. This current weekend of Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday was an excellent time to read this. As the book addresses much about memories, both painful and pleasurable, this is an opportune time to reflect on our beliefs, actions towards others, and what we want for our children. An outstanding book, The Giver is wonderful for young people and adults. This book will stay with me, as some other books in my life have done, constantly challenging me to think and feel when I recall the story. Top-notch!"
5,Perfect!!! Really Exciting and just plain Amazing!!!,"I totally reccomend this book. I had to read this book for my English class and at first I thought it would be really boring, boy, was I in for a suprise. This is one of my favorite books and this book actually teaches you a lesson-- Indivuality is very important and similarty is just plain boring. Accept people's unique traits, because that is what makes the world go round!!!"
5,"A dystopian novel about justice, community, and humanity","Jonas has a great life. He's never hungry, sad, or in pain. He never has to make difficult decisions. And all of his needs are taken care of by the community. Or so he thinks before he is selected as the community's new Receiver of Memory. With the help of his elderly friend, Jonas uncovers the mysteries of the past and faces a terrible decision about the future.The Giver is a completely unique novel about love, beauty, the value of life, and the things that make us truly human. It won the Newbery Medal in 1994."
3,"Good themes, albeit with a slow pace","Mr. A's 8th grade LA class liked this book's themes and symbolism; however, the perceived slow pace turned some of us off, and the ambiguous ending was not appreciated by all. While some of the vague or generalized elements reinforced the book's message, we thought it also took away from some of the excitement that comes with a detail-rich book."
3,"A very interesting, fast paced book.","The Giver,a fiction novel, was written by Lois Lowery. The main charcter is Jonas. There is never weather bacause of climate control. They have a very strickt society and rules. In this book , Lois Lowery was vey constient, she kept the same conflict and didn't change everything alot. I think this is a apporiate for sixth graders not older or younger. This book was very interesting and fast paced."
2,my opinion? Blah.,"I first read this book in seventh grade, for a book report. I had mixed feelings about certain parts, but ultimately hated it. It was too sci-fi for my tastes.I read it again recently, and I still don`t really like it. It`s too confusing, too scifi-ish, too many twists and turns.So, my opinion: unless you absolutely have to read it (like for a school report or something), skip this book."
1,READ THIS,"I thought this book was ghastly. This book is based in a utopia where the government is perfect and everyone lives in harmony. A boy named Jonas has become the receiver of memory, his journey is filled with joy and pain. But the only pain there is s having to read it. If you have a choice don't. The author did an awful job writing it, there was almost no action and it had a linear plot. So do yourself a favour and don't read it."
4,It makes you think...this was a wonderful book.,This was a great book. I recommend it to anyone who wants a challenging read and likes books that are thought provoking. I highly suggest keeping a dictionary at your side while reading this book.
5,The Giver was great because it viewed life from many angles!,I loved The Giver-it was an amazing read. To really better understand the book and its ideas you need to read it a few times. But even after just reading it once it leaves a big impression and makes you think about your life and how different it could be. Another great part of the book is that you could get a great idea of it and its points at any age. I know this is a book that I'll keep and read periodicly throughout my entire life. It totally deserved its Newberry Honor and I would recommend that any parent buy it for their child-and also read it themselves!
3,The Giver,"The Giver is a thrilling book about a young boy who finds about what life is really like. Jonas, the main character, is choosen to be the Receiver of the community. Jonas, the main character finds out what life is really like. Jonas learns that his father is a killer and his friends is soon to be one. Jonas learns the true value of life. Jonas doesn't like the way they run the comunity. I think that this book is intresting becasue it has a lot to do with sience fiction. In this book, Jonas receives memorys from his The Giver. I think that this book is cool because he uses the powers that he is given. I also think that it is intresting becasue it has to do with the future. It is a wonderful suspense because Jonas the main character plans a daring excape. This book was thrillng, funny, and fantastic, that is why I like this book a lot. I think that this book should be read by all ages and in all libaries."
4,the giver,"What can I say, the book was well thought up. it seemed so real that is how wounderfuly written it was. i hope for a second book. the book is based on a time why after all of our genirations. were there is no war, color animals what so ever no pain or true feelings. That is all Jonas has ever known that is intell his twelvth year. when he is chossen to be the next reciver of every memory of time, color war love, loss, true emotions."
5,This is an awesome book,"A friend recomended this book to me. At first i wasn't very interested, but when i started reading it i found myself not able to put the book down. When i finished this book i told all of my friends about it and to read it right away. I even told my communication arts teacher about it and next year the class will be reading it. This book makes you stop and think about what the future will be like. Read this book and i can guarantee that you will fall in love with it!"
3,ehh,"i read the book a while ago and it had good parts and bad parts but overall it was kinda chessey, i woundnt give it to any of my friends"
3,The Giver Review,The Giver was kind of hard to understand in some parts. The community they live in is very different compared to ours! I think you should read this book.
5,Giver a great book,"I had to read this book for a class that i am taking and now i wished i had reda it earlier. I am not so big on reading but this has got to be one of the best things i have ever read. The fact that they book is not only about sharing memories and the importance of that but it lso deals with conformity and all the problems that can occur through onformity. The book describes very well and very creatively what would happen if we descnsitized every body in the world and basically turneds them into drones. The fact that people in this story had their fates chosen by others kind of scared me and made me think, what would we do if this happened to us? I really found this book to be interesting and at times some what confusing but it all became clear again within the next few lines. So in conclusion i will stop babbling and say that this is a great book and i haighly recomend it to anyone who is into strange or unusual things...."
4,A Suspenseful Story,"The Giver is an excellent book. It contains thrilling events, suspense, and leaves the reader curious of what is soon to be discovered. The Giver flows with details describing every motion or breath taken by a charater. I like this book, The Giver, for several reasons. For instance, the book always comes up with something new. At the end of each chapter, there is some suspense. Furthermore, the book makes me think of how good our life is and how perfection is an error. Finally, the detail is helpful when attempting to virtually picture the image. As you can see, The Giver is a splendid book, and I recommend it to anyone."
1,Not recommended for children,"Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually the 12 year old boy,Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price.Parents should be cautioned it has detailed murder of an infant and any sane minded parent should not let their children read such a disturbing story I as an adult was shaken by the contents of this book and makes me wonder how Newbery awards are granted ?????"
1,DON'T READ THE GIVER,IT IS ABOUT A KID NAMED JONAS AND AN OLD GUY WHO GIVES JONAS BAD MEMORIES. THE ENDING IS SO WEIRD. THE BOOK MAKES YOU THINK TOO HARD. IT IS BAD.
1,HOW DID THIS WHEN THE NEWBERY AWARD??,I would have to say this book is one of THE worst books I've ever read! It was totally ridiculous and I hated the ending(If you could call it that.) I felt like throwing the book across the room when I got done reading it. TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! I Loved Number The Stars but this piece of trash doesn't even come close! I'm glad I didn't buy this(got it from school library.) I would have been VERY mad if I did. Don't waste your time with this one!
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS!!!!,"THIS BOOK SUCKS!!! HOW DID IT WIN A NEWBERRY?!?! IT HAS A CRAP ALL ENDING, AND A CRAP ALL MIDDLE, AND A CRAP ALL BEGINNING!!!! THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNT IN MASS QUANTITIES!!!!This book makes me a sad panda."
4,A good choice,"We recently read this book at school. First it was a little bit difficult to understand, but later we really enjoyed reading it. Although the story is very unrealistic, the novel is interesting for ""not fantasy-fans"", too.The novel is about a boy called Jonas, who lives in a world without colours, feelings, music, animals, etc. One day Jonas is selected as the new receiver which means that he gets all the memories from the past. And now everything changes. Jonas gets to know all feeling and colours and he wants to make all people share these memories. But that sounds easier than it is...Start reading the book and you will never want to end!"
4,Good,"It was avery sound book about a utopia and how it would be like. It was mostly in suspence but at times I found it dull and contrary. It semmed to repeate some aspects. It told about the comunity and how it was like. Jonas reiceived all the sads memories that were prior on the burden of the Giver. He was the one that got the job to have all the memories, happy, sad, etc. If you like science fiction you will absolutly love this book."
3,My first English book,"I read ""The Giver"" with my class in English lessons. The book handels about a young boy who lives in a community in which no color and no feelings exist. Although this was my first English book, I've ever read, I've had some difficulties at the beginning, but in the end, I've understood almost everything. A big complimente to the author for her open ending. So everybody can imagine his or her own ending and Jonas'life in future. That's the very interesting thing of the book."
2,Lots of questions,"Although I like suspense and thrills, this book left me with too many questions and really left me unsatisfied. They never really focused on one thing or went into description on what I thought were some very important issues. It is ""The Truman Show"" and ""Pleasantville"" combined."
2,Ok,"It was an easy read. It took me a couple hours and I'm a slow reader. It doesn't go in depth as much as it seems. If you want a better book that gives you the same feelings try ""Brave New World"" or ""1984"""
2,Interesting,"I had to read The Giver for my Magic andRitual class. The book was not without itscharm, but for me, living in that world wouldbe a personal hell. I would go insane!The fact that the persons in that bookhad no choices, independence and among manyother things they couldn't even mature at their own rate. That book goes against every thingthat i believe in, except the fact that thekid had enuf guts to run away.As for the technical side of the book, itwas one of the most poorly written books thatI have ever read. The plot jumped around,you couldn't follow it. Too muchresponsibility was left to the reader.All in all, i would not recomond this book toanyone."
3,Yo read The giver...Please and Thank You,"I would recommend The Giver to children 13 years old or younger. The book explains to the kids we're so lucky that we are allowed to decide on our own. It also has a couple life-lesson morals in the story. For example,"" Choices are important."" The Giver tells us to be determined and never give up, even if things don't go your way. You can never live a perfect life because something or somone can get in your way. That is why I recommend this book to chldren 13 and younger. Read The Giver."
4,To give or to recieve???,"Try to imagine a world without feelings, without color, without decisions. Welcome to the world of a 12 year-old boy named Jonas who lives in a futuristic community that has eliminated all of these things and much more. He can't love his own parents, listen to music, or even decide what he wants to do with his life; all these things are forbidden to him. He has never experienced any of these things until now, but how can he keep these beautiful and wonderful things to himself? How do you explain love or a beautiful sunset to someone who can't see color or express feelings? He decides that he can't go back now since he has experienced these things, he must do something to change the community forever."
5,What a book!! Less YA More Adult!!,"This book had me going with the word...""Start"".I had never given thought to this book and passed it off ""For Kids"", labelled and put it somewhere in the back of my bookshelf. Till, I wanted to read it and I am so glad I finally found the need to!The Giver is set in an era of Sameness - in short a world that has no colour, no memories of the past, all that it has is sameness and a sense of serenity till a boy of the community named Jonas turns twelve.The community has a rule that anyone who turns twelve is asigned his/her profession - and Jonas is the chosen one to ""Receive Dreams and Memories of the past"" by the ""Giver"". The Giver is an old man who has all memories of the world.The crux lies in what Jonas learns and what he must do to gain or rather attain his individualism.An Excellent Read!!"
4,The Giver Review,I think the book The Giver by Lois Lowry was a great book to read! I think it was a great book because it kept me reading the book and wanting to know what else was going to happen in the book next. I would rate this book a four and a half star book. If somone asked me if i would recomend this book to them i would because i think anyone would like this book if they are a good reader or if they arnt. The book is about a young boy named Jonas that lives in a community protected by the rest of the world. When Jonas turns 12 years old he is awarded the job of being that leader of the community. His training of learning all of the information he needs to know is a painful experence for him but after it is all done he feels really good. I dont want to say anything else and spoil the book for others that are going to read it.
4,review - a bit confused,"I am a student that was assigned to read The Giver for class. The first night we recived the book I read it in whole. I couldnt seem to put the book down, the details pulled me in, and there was an element of suspense that wouln't let me go. As I was reading, I decided that this book was one of my favorites. As I reached the end of the book, I was unbelivably dissapointed. This book, which was full of detail, had just left an ending out to the open. Had jonas died? Was he dreaming? What happened? It seemes no one quite knows. If you love a book with a great ending, dont read this one."
5,Changed my life,"This book changed my life and it was sooo exciting. Will be reading many times more. Great book, very cool"
4,"Good ideas, interesting read.","Recommended by a friend, I enjoyed this philosophical book, akthough I found the ending puzzeling. The idea of a utopia with no problems caused many problems was intersting. It is not a must read, but an interesting read just the same."
4,A adventurous thriller,This book would be a great book for you if you like adventures and fiction. Here is a little about the book. Jonas is a young boy who goes to an old man named the Giver. He gets ideas from the Giver about what the world is really like so he decides to take his little brother Gabe and hisself on an adventure to see the real world. If you want to learn more read the book yourself.
5,The giver,"The Giver was a good book because it was so weird. The setting was very diffrent from other books with the common theme.It has some what a unpredictable climax because of the characters feelings during the plot.Also it teaches a life lesson because behind all those words, it teaches that the future is not good to know but,that you have to wait and see."
5,The Best Book I've Read Yet!,"The Giver is really one of the best novels I have read yet. Just by the way that the author imagined a world where everyone is the same, they eat the same, they wear the same clothes, and they have no real emotions. You can even imagine this fantasy world can exist within our everyday life.Jonas was a boy living his life in the normal way like anyone would in his town, only just to find out on his Twelfth year that his life is about to change forever. It shows in it's realistic-fantasy way that he was experiencing what we all go though around his age. Our lives change just like his did; normal in the beginning and then it seems like our lives are in chaos near the end of the change.I couldn't put the book down after I first read it. I really do give this book five stars!"
2,The Giver and censorship,"Censorship represents the amount of confidence a society feels. When a society feels threatened they will attack the ideas in books before the ideas attack the society. The Giver by Lois Lowry is number 14 on a list of 100 books that were reported by the American Library Association to be the most frequently challenged books from 1990-1999. Some of the books this list should be banned, but some of them are not that bad. The giver stresses that a perfect world is one without books for enjoyment. This book also has some suggestive material that I felt was very scary. In conclusion, books aren't great for all readers."
3,LSMS,"To demolish civilization today, you do not have to destroy books by burning them, destroy them by telling people to stop reading them and before long; no one will know what books really are. Our imagination will be nowhere. Censorship of books is much like destroying our thoughts and leaving us nowhere. In many schools today, The Giver, a book by Lois Lowry, has been banned. In this novel, there is apparently, censorship in the society. Even though you may think that this book is nothing like reality, it really is. We censor things like their community does. We don't want our nation to see certain things and neither does the community in The Giver. This censorship may be for better, possibly for the worse. We will never know some things because of censorship. Some things are better left unsaid. This is the reason we censor books even though some minds may be yearning to know these things. Burning books is one way to censor things and telling people not to read is another."
3,The book was very slow in the beggining.,The Giver was very boring and slow in the beggining. It was also confusing. The book got better in the training of the reciever. I do not know why they can't see color. I rated the book a because I did not get the meaning of it. It is confusing because Jonas starts to see color and hearing music and everyone else can't.
4,A book for everyone,"Lois Lowry's novel ""The Giver"" was written in 1994. Being a great book, ""The Giver"" won the prestigious Newbery Medal ""for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children"". It is about a future-world in which feelings and emotions have been abolished. Only the ""Receiver of Memory"" has them. Jonas, a twelve year old boy, is to become the next Receiver. During his training he finds out about the dark secrets that underlie the apparent harmony of his world. The novel is devided into 23 chapters. The language used by the author is often very easy to understand and not to formal. All in all it is a book for everyone."
3,A very special book,"The book ""The Giver"" is a very good book.Lois Lowry has been awarded some prizes.It deals with the future where everything is controlled by the Elders.The main character,Jonas,is elected to be the next Receiver of Memory for the people. He is the one who received all the memories of the people like color,pain etc.But when Jonas finds out the truth about the system,he flees out of the community. Lois Lowry has shown this action in a good way,she shows Jonas`s feelings and imaginations not only in a positive way. I like this book because it shows,how the future could be.It is very exciting to read it but it also has its boring parts.But I really can advise everyone to read this book to find out some own impressions."
4,Comfortably Numb,"This twist of fiction, fantasy, and human nature is one of my favorite books for those reasons. Jonas, the main character, has to abide to the rules of elders who dwell in his community, Receiver of Memory. Along his way, he encounters a strange thing that he personally has never expierienced. He also expieriences love, courage, danger, and hope, all in the eyes of a baby."
4,The Giver Rools,"Well the Giver,I found a very good book Because You Put Allot of Things That Don't really happen in our kind of communnity. But in some countries have a comunist community like jonus's. The only thing that i don't like about the book is the ending,you could have told us if jonus and gabe died,frozen or even made it to elswhere.You did a great job on the book and you put allot of detail into the book."
1,Pretty boring and non exciting,"This boring novel is filled with sci-fi. Only few parts in the book are exciting. Even though strange, it has earned many awards. The author that wrote this book is very talented. It is filled with sadness. The best part in the book is when Jonas (main character) learns what the word released means. Released is when a person is killed that is not reacting good in the community that they live in. In his community there are no automobiles, alcohol, money and many other different things. Instead of driving cars they drive bicycles. There are also no jobs. Instead of money people get things free. Goods are supplied to all households. Over all I don't reccomend this book."
1,The Giver,"We thought The Giver was a poorly written book. Out of five stars we give it one star.This book is about a boy named Jonas who lived in a perfect community where it's colorless and it has climate control. In the community when you turn 12 you get assigned a job. Jonas got assigned the job of receiver of memory. The receiver of memory holds all of the community's memories.Jonas goes on an adventure with a baby in his family unit(the baby's name is Gabriel).We thought The Giver was a bad book because it had a lot of complicated things that the author could have explained better. We didn't like the plot. It built up too slowly and ended too quickly.The book had too much stuff that didn't sound realistic. For example, they had to share dreams at breakfeast.We felt you didn't get a lot of feeling for the characters.In conclusion we thought it was a poorly written book."
5,A wonderful story,"The author of the review ""A Horribly Written Work of Fiction"" obviously is not thoughtful reader. To rant about how stupid it is to give a 12-year old a job in the story is just ridiculous.It appears that this author is just mad because they read it in school. They are wrong, as this is a well-written and very deep book. Lois Lowry is telling us how a society without any emotion is not a perfect society. It is an exciting, quick-paced adventure, and the ending is excting and leaves you to think about what you have just read."
3,Scary Old Man On The Front Cover,This Book was ok because it would get good then it would lose your attention. I liked when Jonas found out that his dad killed the babies because he thought his dad was a pretty good guy until then. I wish his community was more like ares instead of it being based in the future because his community was way to strict. When they became 12 they got a job and started working and learning to be that person of the community. When Jonas gets called up for his award and job the whole auditorium gasps. He gets scared because he thought that it was a bad job. The job of the giver. Then he is walking into a building and going to where you recieve your training. Well at the end of his training he gets a message sent to him from the givers head to his head without talking or anything except with a touch.
2,The ending sucked!,The whole book was great. It seemed to me that there would be a part two but the ending made no sense. Even the author herself said that you can interpret the ending in two ways. But both meanings to the ending sucked!Pretty much the author ruined a good thing in the end. Dumb broad
1,Boring,This book was pretty boring to read. I think it dragged on too long about how he felt in the book. It was pretty much about his life in a community where they have any color. It started out boring but the ending was ok....Otherwise I hated reading this book.
1,I really did not care for the Giver.,"The Giver to me was not a good book. You could not leave in the comunity,and the life style was boring. This book was not my favorite. A little advice - don't read this book. I think the book Green Eggs and Ham was a better book than this book. This book would have been alot better if it had more action. The comunity had alot of dumb rules in it."
1,Gosh,"Well I read this book when I was in 5th grade, exited that it would be a good book from reforences my mom had.I absolutly hate it!!! it is confusing, sad,and for me was an unnessisary read. I loved the authers writing stile and I liked number the stars I just don't think it a good book and would HATE to have to read it again! I would not recomend it for any one under 7th grade thinking about it that would have been abetter time for me to have read something as nerv-rakking as that,when I was reading the book my Mom picked it up to read a few pages and stumbled upon the very sad part where they kill imperfect babys"
5,The best book I have EVER read.,This seriously is the best book I have ever read. It is so different than any other book. And it portrays what life would be like if we didn't have most of our blessings.It shows how one man changed one boy to change the entire world.The emotions you'll have while reading this book are overwhelming. It is so beneficial.
2,It was confusing but an okay book.,A confusing book. It was okay besides that. She might not have made the community as spoiled as it was. Every time they gopt hurt or something they were healed instantly by a pill. It was pretty bad.
5,"This book was GREAT, EXELLENT, SUPER!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is the best book I've ever read! I think that everyone, adults and children, should have the chance to read this book. At first it may be a little confusing but once you get into it you can't put it down! I've read this book three times and each time it is just as good as the first. I highly recomend this book to anyone and everyone. IT'S GREAT!!"
4,A Creepy but Good Book,The book is somewhat creepy through the idea of Sameness but delivers the message of individualism and courage. I would recommend this book to everyone who thinks you need to be society to be part of society.
4,The Giver,"The Giver by Lois Lowry was a great science fiction novel wonderfully written. The language and symbolizim that was used made the book even more compelling, and the way she contradicted herself in some instances. The book also made you think if even some of the things she discribed in her book were even feasible. The ending made the you think about lots of things and what they ment, the clifhanger at the end left a lot of things unclear but my general opinion was I loved it. The Giver was a book that could grab your interests and leave you guessing ,I think that everybody should read this book ."
4,The Giver,"It was a really good book. Very interesting and hard to put down, I absolutely enjoyed this book! I recommend reading this book."
3,What the Giver gives you.,"I felt that the Giver was a good book that showed kids the importance of emotions and their historical backround. I enjoyed the easy reading of Lowry's novel because I was never lost in it. It was also cool that the book took place in some ""other"" world that isn't like ours."
3,The basis of the story opens up many concerns on FREEDOM of CHOICE.,"The Giver was recommended to me by my granddaughter as her favorite book. I found the early chapters a bit confusing as to how the community structure was evolving in such a foreign way. It mystified me if this story was a human, animal, or unknown species. As the story unfolded I felt for young readers could be frightened or mislead by the structure and rules of the community, on how the community tolerated inhumane rules and violations of human dignity perpetrated on all ages. From the killing of young babies, the elderly, and the match making of couples in order to marry, as well as only allowing 2 children per family unit. Where did democracy, freedom, and individual choice disappear to, especially after all the past wars fought to protect FREEDOM for ALL!"
3,Pretty Good,"This book is a good, easy read, probably able to be read in one sitting if there is sufficient time and determination. The plot is interesting and mysterious and draws the reader in quite quickly. If you're into these kind of books, this is the one I would recommend reading first, since it is the simplest. The book has a solid main character who is relate-able to young readers, so I would say this would be a better book for middle school age rather than high school and beyond it."
3,An alright dystopian novel,"The Giver was an alright dystopian at best. The book itself is an easy read and considered a middle-school level read. For an adult, this is a quick and easy read. The novel itself is short and leaves the reader on a cliff hanger of what is to come in other novels. The book is no more, than an introductory for people those who want to get into the genre of stories and novels under dystopia. At best, this book will hook you at first, but to reread this simple novel is not worth the trouble. It is a good one shot read and a good start for late readers who are starting to read in middle school at the grade level of seventh or eighth grade."
4,kinda boring,beggining is kind of bland and non descriptive but starts to get interesting a little bit later. the setting sounds communist and dull and not really intruiging until later but still a good read
4,Thrilling page turner,"If you want a book filled with suspense and surprises read The Giver. At the end of each chapter ,the author, Lois Lowry leaves you questioning and wanting more. I liked this book because it gives you a shocking look of what the past or present looks like. After a few chapters it seems like you really are in their ""community"". The book was little slow in the beginning because I didn't understand it, but then it really picks up and you can put it down. I recommend this book for all ages."
4,lydias review,"In the story ""The Giver"" by Louis Lowery, they try to make a utopia, but it ends up becoming a dystopia. The main charactors are a boy named Jonas,who is 12 years old, the Giver,and a little boy name Gabe. They live in a comunity away from everyone else where they dont have feelings and everyone in equal. I don't like this selection because they're trying to be perfect and when they were doing that, they killed people for no reason, like if they're old or if they dont mature fast enough. Also they dont have love or familys.by... Lydia Barrett"
3,The Giver,"The Giver is an interesting book. The part I liked about the book was when it talked about Sameness. Sameness was an amazing town. Everyone in the community got along, there wasn't any fighting or any body getting hurt. Also I liked Jonas because he used his gift or shall I say memories which is his job for a good cause. For example, when Gabriel couldn't sleep at all Jonas gave Gabriel a memory to help him dream good dreams that helped him sleep. There was also something I didn't like, like the part in Sameness,where children was put in groups by their age and everyone in that group had to look exactly alike. They had to wear their hair alike and the same exact clothes. I wouldn't won't to do that. I think that was a cruel thing to do to children. I really liked that in Samness no one goes hungry. In the world we live in there are lots of people going hungry.So over all The Giver was an excellent book and I would probably love to read it again!!"
3,It was OK.,The Giver was an OK book. It had some good parts and bad parts. I liked the middle of the book better than the end. The end kindof kept me hanging in mid-air. You kind of have to interpret your own ending. The way the writer described things was very vivid and easy the imagine. I like the way she made up her own world it basically made the whole book.~*~ Lawren ~*~
3,My Opinion,"The book was alright. I am not going to say really anything bad because I have never wrote a book myself. The book was kind of confusing but not much. The meaning of the book was ok. It was kind of wierd how every one there was the same. The people there did no wrong and if they did they would be hit with some kind of stick. So the book was alright there was nothing wrong with it. So ""The Giver"" is a good book to me."
4,"9th Grader, Just finished book","Let me tell you this, this is a great book. I believe that the ending could have been better(and yes, i got it). A real great fantasy story. I loved it but it only gets a 4 dut to the ending."
4,Deep,"I really felt this book is a must read for people of all ages! The main reason is because I believe that within Lowis Lowry's THE GIVER, everyone can find something to relate to. For example, Jonas, the main character, is very worried about his future life, like many people are. From another view, Jonas also seems to feel left out, a feeling many younger people and adolescents can relate to. Another aspect of this book that I feel should strike a chord with anyone and everyone who reads it, is how wonderful it is to have variety. Just as had happened in the book, everyone ended up with the same birthday, not being able to see colors... dressing alike etc. Thank God we don't have to worry about that! I feel that people, when reading this book should focus on the feelings that Jonas experiences when being the Giver's tutoree... so to speak. He goes from confusion to understanding- from sadnees to overwhelming joy. The spectrum of emotion that Lowry reflects is amazing!"
5,wonderful,This book captures the minds of the reader and sets it off into the unknown. The mind body and soul of the reader switches off into the world jonas is living. you never want to put te book down . You feel as if you are in the book watching the whole story take place.. I luv it!! -camie
4,Interesting by Rollie,"The book The Giver by Lois Lowry is very interesting. I think that the book makes sense if you think about it. It is trying to tell us, without actually telling us, how much we take feelings, pain, weather, and colors for granted. In everyday life we may say, ""It's a beautiful day today!"" But we never do much to show that we care about any of it. I bet if we got feelings, pain, weather, and colors taken away from us we would miss it a whole lot. This book captures your attention and is a must read!!!"
4,my review of the giver,The GiverThe best part of the giver was when the giver gaveJonas the memories to remember all the things that happen.The part of the book was whenJonas father killed the young child that was in a difforent community thats why i gave it a 4 stars.The other good part of it was at the start Jonas had a memory of him on a hill with a sled and he fell down and hurt himself and at the end Jonas and Gab and him saw the sled at the top of a hill.
2,The Giver : A Weak Attempt at Allegory (with a Bad Ending),"The book was tollerable and even enjoyable until the conclusion. The book falls apart at the end. If you want a true, classic and socially enlightening book, then read THE SCARLET LETTER by Hawthorne. Lowry's weak attempts at making the boy Christlike include: a red apple (a color only seen by the boy), discovering christmas, and saving a baby from death. If you are looking for a happy ending, you'll have to fill in the blanks..."
3,Not really for kids,"Many kids including me only think this book is so so, but the adults in our school love it. Go figure"
3,A Great Story BUT not for kids,"The Giver revealed an intriguing worldview, as it gave the reader something ""different"" to debate. I thought it was slow to start. The realease of the lighter twin was extremely graphic and grosteque. I think this book should not be read for fun or even in schools. This book is for adults. I don't like how this book is being pitched to school children as early as grade 6!"
1,The Giver,"I thought The Giver was bad. It was boring, and there really wasn't a point. Are assignment for school was to read one or two chapters a night, and it was really hard for me to fulfill the assignment. My mom and my sister tryed reading it, and they only got through three chapters, and then put it down."
3,Overall I liked this book.,The only parts in the book that I did not like were the begining and end. The begining was to confusing and I did not understand it until about chapter six. The ending was okay but that was not the way that I wanted it to end.
1,Identical twin,I am a Identical twin. I don't like the book for this reason. I do not like the how they kill a identical twin boy. thank you
1,wish i never read it,"i dont think I've ever read a book this bad. it is very disturbing. i mean, who thinks of killing babies as a normal thing in any situation ?! not to be a prude but the whole bathing thing is just gross . it's also the worst ending I've ever read. this book is sooooo boring! i had to read it for school and i almost fell asleep reading it and i never do that. don't read this book. don't look at it. don't think about it. you would seriously regret it. i would give it negative stars if i could.XOXO HR Cali"
3,Depressing,"I know this book is for teens so maybe i shouldn't even review it - but i thought it was too depressing for any age group, especially kids. The utopia that this society has created is just weird and flat. I thought the characters were like robots - including the main characters. The ending bothered me - i don't want to spoil it, but i thought after such a flat world and existence that the main character should have at least found what he was was looking for. This is not a story that you walk away from feeling good."
4,Too many questions-not enough answers,"This was a great book and it made you ask a lot of questions. The problem with that is that there aren't any ANSWERS!!!!!!!!I know the author wants us to use our imaginations but at least give us something to build on. Nobody knows. Is it a communist government? Do they live in a Biodome in the future? Or, is it something more like the INVASION OF THE HUMAN BODY SNATCHERS????Too many questions, not enough answers!!!!"
3,"Good book, but sometimes a little bit overdone.","I am a high school freshmen and we read this for freshman english. I told my mom that we were going to read this and she didn't seem very happy. I asked her why and she said that it was a good book but didn't think that we should be reading it in a christian school. Why you might ask, is because they like to over do their community just a little bit! Almost to much! Anyway, my suggestions are to read it but remember who you are!!!!!"
1,The Giver,"To me reading The Giver was just a class assignment. I am not what you would call me a ""reading type."" If I had to say some good things about it I would say that it had a lot of feeling. To me, The Giver was a wierd book. But it was interesting in some parts of the story. Like when he tells his parents his special dream, that part made me laugh. The Giver was an alright book to me, but to someone else it could be the greatest book they have ever read."
1,Great Book to Read Into,"Jonas is a kid that seems to have a normal life. However as he starts to grow older he realizes that his town isn't all that great. He notices differences that he's never seen before. His perfect little town seems to come to start losing its appeal when he learns more about the ""outside."" This is a great book for children to read, and a great book for older kids to look into the ""hidden"" meanings. I encourage people of all ages to read it.-MM, Sunapee High School."
1,Clear Agenda,The messages in this book promote socialistic ideas. Suggesting that imperfect young and the imperfect old can be removed from a culture is a scary idea. The thought of a sinful society ever being able to realize a non hostile environment where all people get along is misleading. The thought that a birth mother is an improved model over the traditional family is another lie. The whole book will leave most kids confused about the real world we live in.
1,The Taker of Time,"1,000 Monkeys + 10 Typewriters + infinte time = The works of Shakespeare10 Monkeys + 5 Typewriters + 30 minutes = The GiverPossibly the worst book I have ever read. Its only purpose is to take up your time. If I want to read fiction I'll read C.S Lewis or J.R.R Tolkien. I wasted a whole day on this book! And, if the author is trying to teach me something, I sure didn't pick it up. In the process of reading this book another thought came to me. If the author really put thought into this book, where there is everything from baby killing to a person burning up, then perhaps she needs a bit of R&R.; The Giver reminds me of what I think of after a real bad day. I hope you can see what I mean."
1,"Dull, but pretty good","The Giver wasn't really my type of book. It was good in a lot of parts like the dream he had about Fiona. I am a violent kind of person and I think this book could have used a bit more violence, but over all I rate this a one. Sometimes I wonder what the ending meant."
1,I can't believe this is a children's book,"that is recommended for students to read! It is ghastly! It starts out by sucking you into a mystery that you just can't figure out what is going on but with the ending you are left with a ""WHAT?"". My children were shocked to find out one of the main characters is a baby killer. What makes this book great? The others comment about the similiarities to the movie The Village but at least that movie has some good to it and has a message that doesn't leave you hanging!"
2,The Giver Review,I recently read The Giver in class. I personally didn't enjoy it. I thought Lous Lowery didn't do a good job of sticking to her story line. In some parts of the book she would say one thing the community did then the next chapter she would say something tatally opposite making the book not flow and make sense. Ialso thought the ending was to sudden and didn't answer any questions i had.
5,Great quick book!,Its an amazing book for all ages. I read it as a kid and forgot about it til recently and really wanted to read it again to see if it was as amazing as I recalled it to be. And it was! Must read for all ages.
2,The Book is ok!!!!!!!!,"I think the book is ok, in the begining it is very boring and confusing, but in the middle of thr book it gets very good.I really hate the ending of the book..........:("
4,The Giver review,"The novel &#65533;The Giver&#65533; is about a community without colour, war, love or pain. Everything is the same and under control by &#65533;The Elders&#65533;. There are no choices and everybody is assigned a role in the community. When Jonas becomes 12 he is going to receive special training from the Giver. The Giver translates Jonas all the memories and the pleasure of life. There is no turning back for Jonas. As he discovers the secret of the community, he wants to go to Elsewhere. I suggest that book to readers who like to be left wondering and thinking, because if you read this book, that&#65533;s you will be doing by the end.*** www.....de.vu ***"
3,The Giver,"Jonas, a 12-year-old boy and his family are living in a very odd environment. Jonas is selected for a very special job in his community. Jonas decides to run away, will he make it past the security guards? To find out all these facts and others read this book. This is a laid back relaxed book. I recommend this to sixth grade and above...This is a three out of five star book."
2,The Giver,At first I think this book will be a funny book but it isn't. It's a very hard and sad story. You have no own opinion and you miss all the beautiful events in life. The people in the community live in a prison from which you can't escape. For me the book is very interesting - but sometimes a little bit boring. It's a different style than other books have - that's one important reason for me to read this book.
2,Poorly executed and abrupt,"Felt like the first half of a longer book. I might have liked it if it weren't for the childish writing style. It reminded me of a the way a 10-year-old tells you about his day-- ""First this happened. And then this happened. And then this. And then this.""Just not really good overall. As some of the other reviewers suggest, read 1984 or Brave New World, or countless others instead. One might argue that this book has more of a metaphysical leaning but those concepts weren't really given the proper treatment. The lofty ending might not have been as bad if the first 90 percent of the book weren't so matter-of-fact."
3,Pretty Good-- 3.5 stars to be exact,I read this book about a year ago and I thought it was good. I thought it was very interesting to see what the author thought the future could be like (for instance how the married couples are assigned to each other by their interests instead of falling in love). I liked the small twist at the end and would recomend this book for people who like science ficton as well as anyone who enjoys an easy-to-read and interesting book.
4,*Think of Life*,"When you think of life , be happy you have someone who loves you or when you love someone.When you think of life,be glad that you have someone to take care of you, a shoulder to cry on. Read this book and see things in a whole new way."
4,"Dull world, interesting book.","The Giver is a very interesting book. Lois Lowry does an excellent job in creating an utopian world that takes place in the distant future. However, as Jonas the protagonist learns, this world isn't perfect. The communities are hiding a secret, even from themselves!With an intriguing plot, setting, and characters, I was able to read the book in two sittings, unable to notice the passing of time. When a book is able to do that, we all know it's good."
5,Gets you thinking...,Lois really gets you thinking about what life would be like if we were all the same. He creates an inspiring world in which every one is the same and you do not have to make any important decisions. I deeply enjoyed it.
3,No Ending,Great book but no real ending to the story. I am so dissapointed because I want to know what happens.
3,"nice vocals, but the music style is too emo for me","I'm sorry. I think that people were a little too ""star-happy"" about this cd. I think they gave the album a little more credit than it is due. I can appreciate that Melee is good at what they do. Hence why I gave them the 3 stars. The lead singer has an outstanding voice. But alas....he is bordering on being another whiny emo kid through most of the songs. And the music....yeah the band itself is in synch and has put in their hours of practicing to get everything just so. But....I just can't hear this type of emo/indie music with a ""fresh ear"" anymore. I feel like it's been done a million different times, and it just all sounds the same to me.For that reason, I am not as generous with my star rating....and I am probably going to give this cd away to someone."
1,"I agree, this deserves 0 stars","I have to agree with the folks that panned this book. I don't know what the reviewers who applauded it were looking at.Sadly this is another example of what we see too much from Wrox, a hastily written, superficial, badly edited ( I would say not edited at all. I can't believe the number of typos and grammatical errors. ) book rushed into print to try and cash in.For shame, Wrox."
5,An Excellent Book Which Delivers What Its Title Promises,"An excellent book to learn C++ database programming using MFC and ATL. The examples are clear and the code compiles and works! I am a professional Visual Basic programmer who uses ADO in building Visual Basic interfaces to Access, Oracle and SQL Server databases. I have C++ experience, but little C++ Windows programming experience. I highly recommend this book if you want to learn C++ database programming."
1,LOGO WARNING!!!!!,"I've got no problem with the film and this Good Times version probably is the best looking version around. However, with the GT logo throughout the film, the disc is a completely worthless ripoff. In full screen."
2,Another Rom stereotype,"One illustration in this otherwise innocent tale clearly depicts Gypsies as ""wood people"" who, the text says, will ""take"" children if they wander into the forest. It is unfortunate to see such blatant stereotyping --- in an age when the Romany (Gypsy) population of Eastern Europe is the target of more hate crime than at any time since the Holocaust. It's too bad that so many children's authors remain completely insensitive to the slavery and poverty suffered by the Rom. Discerning readers can help by avoiding books that include any kind of sterotyping.---Alyssa A. Lappen"
5,What will really make us safe?,An eye-opening and thought-provoking read. Schneier gives us the analytical tools we all need to think both calmly and wisely about what really makes us safe. He also helps his readers understand what effective security really looks like. (And it's not always what you think it might be.) Highly recommended.
3,errors,"movie had funny parts in it but i can only say that even though they bought mozart back with them, why did it change to beetoven in the end"
2,Schlock-fest,"Oh man is this dumb. Where to begin. Frankenstein's daughter returns home after completing medical school. She is very interested in his work, but he wants her to have nothing to do with it. Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant create the monster during a thunderstorm. Not thirty seconds after the creature comes to life, it kills the doctor.Now the daughter (Lady Frankenstein) wants to build a creature of her own to destroy the creature that killed her father and a couple in the woods. She wants the assistant's brain and put it in the body of the good looking(?) retarded garden guy.Well she seduces the retard, kills the assistant for his brain and makes her monster. The two fight at the end and everyone dies, including the Lady. Bought it on sale, what can I say?"
5,Skip the sleep clinic -- make an appointment with Dr. Seuss!,"I should write this review under an alias so I can keep getting credit for helping grownups who can't get to sleep ... all my other clever professional tactics aside, this book is the clincher. I get sleepy just taking it off the shelf, and I have to turn my head away as folks leaf through the pages. If you're lucky enough to have a youngster as your excuse for buying this book, bravo -- and if not, well, put it by your bedside anyway. You won't be awake long enough to regret it. Sweet dreams ...."
4,Good one.,All of Dr. Seuss' books are great but this isn't one of my favorites. A little long but enjoyable.
5,Very very cool!,"Bought this book to read to my 2 y.o., but I have to admit I read it by myself as well :) I just LOVE it! One of Dr. Seuss BEST!!!Strongly recommend it!!!"
1,Don't buy this!,"If your dog is a strong chewer at all, don't buy this toy!! My medium-sized golden retriever chewed through the rubber ends on this in less than 5 minutes! He enjoys other Kong products, but this one's a bust, don't buy it."
1,Did not serve the purpose,This toy is supposed to be chewed. It is a dental stick. My 6 month old lab chewed both ends off the first week. I had to take it away from him because he ate pieces of it. It was a waste of money and not safe for even moderate chewers.
2,Puppy said it sucks,He's the expert - not me. Has chewed a total of about 30minutes over the past 5 months. ALL kong products so far - my 3 dogs think they suck. Except the fuzzy lamb.
3,Sadly Disappointed.,"I was really excited to purchase these. OXO has always provided me with quality kitchen equipment that works fabulously. Unfortunately, these spoons did not live up to that expectation. The writing on the spoons quickly wore off after only having them for a month. Now I cannot verify that I am, in fact, using the tablespoon. In addition, one of the spoons fell apart. I am sadly disappointed, but not get willing to give up on OXO products yet."
3,I guess it's my fault for choosing plastic,"Since I've bought these two or three have melted while I have left them near my cooking area. Yes, I should put them away and yes, I should've opted for metal but I didn't think about that at the time. So, next time I'll opt for stainless steal."
4,"okay product, great customer service","I've had these spoons and the measuring cups for less than a year. We registered for them last year and received them as a gift. In just a few months, the labels on each of them had worn away. I had heard that Oxo had a lifetime satisfaction guarantee on all of their products and I confirmed this by looking at their website. After calling customer service and answering a few questions about the product, they offered to send me replacements FREE, and I didn't have to send the old ones back. I now have two new sets. I'm sticking with OXO products in the future :)"
3,Good set of measuring spoons,"The OXO Good Grips 6-piece Measuring Spoon Set offers an easy to use clip that allows you to remove one or more spoons at a time. When not in use, the clip keeps the entire set together. The spoons are not the most stylish ever (actually I prefer a standard stainless steel set), but they do get the job done. The lettering/numbering is just simply painted on. Plus, the spoons are rather thick. Stainless steel spoons usually thinner because of the material, but these OXO spoons are thick plastic. So getting them into tight containers or spice jars can be difficult, if not impossible."
5,Great cooking utensils at a great price,You really good a good value with the Oxo good grips line. The spoons are made well and nothing scratches our circulon pots. The plastic is strong and nothing melts on the stove as easily as other brands do.
2,Eh.,"I received these measuring spoons as a wedding present, and liked them for the bright dots that showed the measurement. Unfortunately, those bright dots wore away very quickly and I found the spoons to be bulky and the hanger to be awkward. I have small kitchen drawers, and these measuring spoons never lay smoothly in the drawer and often keep my drawer from closing or keep it from opening. Overall, I would suggest a set that nestles more closely unless you plan to hang them somewhere. Of course, the spoons work fine, but they are certainly not the best I have ever used."
5,A great help in the kitchen,"These are so nice. They are heavy plastic, color labeled, and raise labeled. My last set broke easily and lost their labels. I see a long and bright future for these in my kitchen."
3,Bulky Plastic Junk,"Pros:Spoons clip to plastic ring that can be used to keep them togetherHandles have good gripCons:Poor build qualityBulky (takes up a lot of drawer space)Bottom Line:Get something that is less bulky and nicer made. There are many imperfections around the rubber handles, mainly where they meet up with the spoon and where the numbering/lettering is for the spoon size. See my photo for a comparison of a set of metal spoons vs these spoons for how much drawer space they use up. The handles on these are fairly flexible, and they just don't feel good to me. Do they do the job measuring? Sure, but all measuring spoons are on equal footing for that task."
5,LOVE LOTTY,"We asked dear old St. Nicholas to bring our daughter a bright, soft (she is incredibly soft) and cute plush toy for Christmas. Our five-month-old daughter is in love with Lotty. She loves to pull at Lotty's antennas. We also will put Lotty on our daughter's tummy and let her play that way. My only fear is ... that we will wear Lotty out with all the love she is getting, LOL!!!"
1,This Soundtrack SUCKS!!!,"The song ""Heckler"" by primus is the only good song on this soundtrack! But if you want that song buy Primus's album ""Suck on this"" and you'll get other good songs along with it, rather than a bunch of [stuff] that you'll never listen to. There isn't much you can say about this soundtrack, so I will leave the rest up to your imagination."
3,mesh ring,I loved the look of the ring. It is very comfortable. The problem is that the mesh comes apart and there are sharp pieces that catch on everything. I dont know how this can be repaired. I would not buy it again.
4,Chick in his prime,Chick Corea owned the 70's when it came to both jazz and fusion. This recording is a wonderful example of how much latin and Spanish music define him during this era. You'll even hear those influences in his Return to Forever projects. Too many tunes to review every one but all are great compositions and exemplify why Chick gained his well-deserved reputation as a master player and composer.
5,"Phoebe,you did it! Thank you!","I first saw her movie when I was 8 and now I'm doing my master's degree.As a truely loyal fan,one thing I always feel sad is she's in too many 80's sex-comedy stereotype movies and be in few good movies(except Gremlins 1,2) because I know she's a talented actress who can do something better than kissing or giggling.When she got married with Kevin Kline 10 years ago and having 2 children I didn't expect to see her in any movie until I saw Princess Caraboo.I wonder if only last decade she's more selective with her role or took such a wonderful one like Princess Caraboo,she'd be the brightest actress now. Princess Caraboo is what Phoebe fans long to see and so does everyone.This movie makes you love her even more. Thank for the BEST and MOST BEAUTIFUL performance you give,Phoebe.You may not know how much you make fans happy but I'm here to tell you. Thank you!!"
3,Ok. Not the Best,"I saw the ENGLISH version of this concert live in Denver at the opening night of the Pepsi Center, Denver, Colorado, USA. I am glad I did not see the concert at the Stadium in Paris. It lost some of intimacy compared to the Denver concert. It helped that I was fourth row center stage. The sound recording was not the best on this DVD again compared to Denver concert. Great voice especially in the French sections but even then she was a little weak compared to Denver. Maybe just the shere size of that Stadium.The additional sections on this DVD a GREAT though. The studio recordings of "" Lets Talk about Love "" and her French Album."" S'il Suffisait D'aimer "" were truly the best part of this DVD. EXCELLENT. Nice to see the behind scenes and commentaries. I re-play these sections more than the concert."
5,Highly Functional - Best Utensil in my Kitchen,This spatula has a perfect design - its grip is terrific. It makes it easy to turn pancakes etc in a pan. Its perfectly sized. It's stainless steel. It hangs easily. What more could you want. Highly recommended.
2,where's the handle?,I was disappointed that the product I received does not match the posted photo. The comb I recieved does have the rotating teeth - which is great for untangling hair but it's awkward to use because it has no handle. The teeth completely line the comb. The comb shown has a handle and then a line of teeth. I would prefer that design and was disappointed not to receive it since I ordered 3 of these combs.
4,old school memphis,pretty decent album for being so old.alot of the content on his songs theyre still rappin about today.its very rare but i have one for sale as well as many other out of print rap cds.EMAIL!
2,kaleidoscope,"Delivery took a long time, I damaged the cd when opening it, because there was a very slim cover on the cd. Difference between package and cdcover was not visible. Complaint, but reaction from seller very low. CD's damaged by customer will not be replaced. Reaction from me, returning customer, gave no reaction at all from seller. last cd I bought there.Music is overwhelmingly good, by the way."
2,Great Album Ruined By Tape Hiss,"No doubt this is a 5 star performance. Armstong's vocals are sublime, as is Peterson's piano playing. But be forewarned, this remastered cd has an overbearing amount of tape hiss! I don't know anything about the modern technology that goes into these ""remasters"" but it is hard to believe there wasn't something that could have been done to reduce this horrible tape sibilence while preserving the overall sonic quality. I have never heard this 1957 album either on vinyl or its original cd issue; all I can tell you is that if you are at all bothered by tape hiss, you're not going to derive much enjoyment from this remastered cd. Too bad, because it is a nice performance (if a bit light on Louis' trumpet solos) from what is my favorite Louis Armstrong period - the late Fifties."
4,Meeting of jazz masters,"The songs are standards, done by many other musicians. Performances are - as expected from these musicians - good. It's relaxing, nice, enjoyable, mostly slow tempo. But I'm not sure this is among their best work, I think both have been more sparkling and imaginative elsewhere (Louis plays W.C.Handy, Plays Fats, and Peterson with Clark Terry etc). Sound quality on the Verve Master Edition remaster is decent, but with more hiss and less soundstage than Verve's best of the period."
2,Sizing is a big problem,"The fabric itself is acceptable but not great as you could see for the price tag of ~ 100usd, so the price after discount is even still a bit high compared to its quality.The sizing is a big big problem, size S is way far bigger than same size of any other's brand. Recommended to buy two size smaller than what you normally wear."
1,"Wan, boring, inexplicable","What is the appeal of Andrea Bocelli? He's cute, he's blind....but can he sing? On the basis of this CD, I'd say he can't. He carries a tune adequately, but the quality of his singing is enervated, listless, thin and monotonous. Asking around to some people who adore him, I've found that his fans are mostly those who don't like real classical or opera singing -- Bocelli's brand of light crooning does the trick for them. If you like that, too, this CD may be for you."
5,Bocelli's talent is heaven-sent!,"Sr. Bocelli is one of the rare artists who realizes that he is not the sole source of his gift. In celebrating sacred music, this is the voice of a believer, and unlike a pop tune, reaches another place in the heart of the listener. The 4 ""Ave Marias"" alone are a wonder to behold, each unique yet heart-felt. ""Mille Cherubini in Coro"" will be a lullabye sung to new generations for years to come, and ""Gloria a te,Cristo Gesu"" welcomes the Jubilee Year with gusto. This is an album to treasure in a weary world!"
1,Very Traditional Roman Catholic renditions of religious arias.,"This is a VERY traditional Roman Catholic CD, for, like, Latin Mass lovers, so be aware of that. Amazon carries another, better, edition of this CD which you should check out before you buy this one:Sacred Arias [Special Edition with Bonus DVD] The Ave Maria is especially moving."
5,sacred arias,This CD is MAJESTIC. The Sancta Maria is a beautiful arrangement from Mascagni's intermezzo to his opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Ave Verum Corpus by Mozart is equally beautiful arranged. This was probably difficult to accomplish since both compositions were created for strings and orchestra. The rest ofthe selections are also enchanting. This is a flawless CD. A Must. I encourage anyone to acquire it.
1,Probably one of the worst math textbooks period,"I am an undergraduate student taking PDEs now and this is our textbook. Please don't listen to others who gave this a good review. This book has no concrete organization. The exercises are horrible. And they assume so much. Instead of convincing us that a mathematical step is valid, they ask us to trust them, because the proof is too advanced. The problem with this teaching style is that there is nothing, no logical understanding, to grasp onto, which is what students need to retain something in their brain! Please if you are a professor using this book, just take a little time during class to ask your students what they think. I guarantee you wont be using this book again."
3,alright,"this is an alright CD.....Sonny's voice is tolerable...""Note To Self"" and ""Ride The Wings...."" are good song ""Emily"" isnt the greatest song, but its alright.....Sonny's voice isnt all amazing like people make it seem....its alright, its really high pitched, but its alrightoverall...listen to samples of it before you buy it...."
2,this isnt their first cd,"This is the second release from FFTL and in my opinion this is worse then their first recording. Before this cd they released their 7 song EP ""aesthetic"" and had a different singer. If you are a fan of this cd, definatly check out their ep, the guitar player Matt does most of the singing i believe, and they have a different person doing the screaming. I give their ep a 4 or 5 star rating."
2,Meh,"While this album has its good moments I would have to say that they are heavily outweighed by the bad. I would have to say that my main complaint is the singer's voice when he sings. His screams are decent but his singing is just, eh. This record isn't exactly a masterpiece of its genre."
3,Working to identify immediately with the new screamers,"""Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has A Body Count"" is a Record describable as Semi-acoustic Indy-Punk with massively strained vocals and enough rhythmic background projection to smash your skull through 4 layers of drywall. The Record's title made me characteristically roll my eyes due to the fact that we all had angst-filed childhoods, but the record is actually very solid all the way around for this style of music. Released In June of 2004 on Epitaph Records, the band includes: Sonny on lead vocals, Matt on Guitar/Vocals, Travis on Guitar and scream, John on bass and scream, and Derek on Drums and scream. Check out the band's website at www.fromfirsttolast.com. All content copyright www.maximumink.com."
3,"a good prospect, not enough songs though","I think these guys are better than the first reviewer wrote, but we all have our own opinions thats why we like different bands. But for a first full length cd, this band sounds a bit lost with some of their riffs but thier drumming and kick bass is tight. A couple solid songs are Kiss me im contagious, and secrets dont make friends. well i'd say anyone who likes the used, or story of the year wont be disappointed."
3,Not impressive,"There are about 3 really good songs on this album. The rest of it is pretty lame. This band has the potential to be good, but they don't relly pull it off."
5,Anyone who thinks this is about drugs is missing the point.,"A deeply insightful work, a superb novel by a man known last and least as a novelist. Uplifting, liberating, inspiring and empowering. The most perfectly realized utopia of the whole genre, not excluding Huxley's ""Island""."
4,Detailed ride of addiction,"This story is a detailed account on addiction, which just goes to show that addiction today is the same as it was 100 years ago. It gets into the nitty gritty of addiction: the beginning, peak, end, the highs, the lows, and the recovery. I was really skeptical about this book; it being written by Crowley (a well known occultist), but this story doesn't really touch upon the occult, it sticks to the subject matter and the nature of human will. A good book overall, I Highly recommend to anymore dealing with substance abuse or knows someone dealing with substance abuse"
4,Very good overview of designing scalable .net enterprise app,"This is a very good overview on how to design scalable .net enterprise applications.The book covers most aspects concerned. We get coverage of how to choose the operating system for each layer in a scalable application. We further get input on how to choose the right cluster architecture, database and storage design, application design (including a thorough overview of web services design).The fact that Sten Sundblad has written the foreword witnesses the quality and importance of this book.The first 8 chapters are dedicated to theory. In the ninth (and last) chapter we also get to follow some use cases from UML modeling to finished code. In between we get info about how to set up the application environment and choosing storage design. Focus is always on scalability design, something many developers might need to spend more time on.For me at least, this has been very interesting and educational. Hopefully you will fell the same."
4,Howls of Laughter,"I first came across this CD about 5 years ago and I have laughed each time I have listened ever since. It was only when this CD was stolen that I realised how much I missed not only the tunes of each track - but also the humour and wit of the lyrics. As a woman, Christine's lyrics say all I want to hear about relationships and life. Biological time-bomb could have been written about all my friends now in their 30's. And the thought of anyone writing a love song about Prince Charles has me in stitches each time I hear it! If you want laughter with tunes - this CD is a great listen."
2,Too soft and won't stay on,"The pencil loses its sharpness REALLY quickly, I mean within a single use. And the line bleeds quickly too so within an hour I have dark patches instead of lines underneath my eyes. The only reason for 2 star instead of 1 is the attached sharpener. But with a pencil that gets dull so quickly they really needed to attach a sharpener."
5,A beautiful and practical guide to holistic parenting.,"I give this book as a gift to all my expectant and new mother friends. It has chapters on child development, imagination and play, health, and education all from an integrated, holistic perspective. It is filled with beautiful color photographs and illustrations, practical advice and how-to information on making toys, children's games to play, etc. As a student of Waldorf Education, I recommend this book to all parents of young children who are interested in learning more about the Waldorf philosophy. Helpfully, the author of the chapter on education compares different educational philosophies including Rudolf Steiner (Waldorf), Piaget, John Dewey, Maria Montessori and others. A valuable and enlightening resource -- highly recommended."
4,This Score Rocks!,"Wow! I recall thinking the music was pretty cool in the movie, but hearing Carlo Siliotto's score by itself is a revelation! A welcome return to good 'ol fashioned orchestral film music -- classic, melodramtic themes laced with darkness, sadness and heart. Very Morricone in parts, very noirish, but very much its own voice... finally, a current comic book movie film score not afraid to have infecutous themes! I had forgotten that Siliotto had scored ""Fluke"" - love that score too. Let's get this guy scoring more Hollywood movies pronto! CD Booklet kicks butt too,lots of notes and cool art. Sweet CD!"
1,Horrible Edition of a Classic,"Whatever you do, do not purchase this edition of ""The Professor's House."" As stated in other reviews, it truly appears that they (whoever put this together) never once considered hiring an editor or going through the work themselves. There are no chapter headings, weird paragraphs, symbols replacing foreign letters, and grammar and punctuation errors all over. I regret getting this edition."
2,The Tao Ain't Happening In This Movie,"If you take this movie as a spoof and plot rip off of ""The Forbidden Kingdom"", and your 13 years old, than you just might get some enjoyment out of it. Though is not anywhere in the league of FK. The movie is a poorly written, acted, low budget, teen flick. The martial arts and special effects are mediocre. Save your money and buy FK."
1,"Two units, two failures","I'd be happy with this cleaner if only it didn't cease to function. The first lasted under three weeks of thrice-weekly use. The seller replaced the unit and the replacement lasted about 6 months.The failure mode is like this: the unit works normally for a period of time between say 1 second and 2 minutes. Then 5 is added to the timer several times until the value on the display is over 20 and the unit switches itself off. So it seems like the controller is going crazy. No matter, the cleaner is useless to me."
1,Bench came up a bit short for me,"Although I do believe that the price was fair, I certainly don't think it was a 200+ dollar bench as it was stated to be. The quality is too poor for that. It's flimsy, made of very thin plywood. Definately wouldn't let a larger person sit on it, I would be afraid it would break."
2,Terrible Quality DVDs,"This is a great show, and it is a crime that the quality control on production of these DVDs has failed the creative team behind this show. I don't even have an HD tv and I was painfully aware of the fact that these DVDs were produced using sub par compression techniques. Just pop it into your computer and you can see that they've compressed 4 Eps down to 4.35 GB!! That's less than a DVD-5 can hold. This is DVD production malpractice. I'm going to be really cynical and saw that I can only surmise that this is a ploy to force people who want decent quality to purchase HD versions of the episodes. This season is not yet available to purchase on BluRay, but it /will/ be..."
3,Legal Drama,Great legal storylines and trial action. I began losing interest in Season 2 because the main character remains aloof and cold to most of what comes into her life. She shouldn't be so put together and so analytical. But I still enjoy the legal storylines and how the main characters prevail in the courtroom.
2,Not amazing,"This product is definitely not worth $12.99 . It fits my NB-1L battery, but it doesn't charge unless there is some kind of weight pushing the battery down into the charger. It's very light and does not seem to be of very high quality. I'd say it would be worth 4 or 5 bucks."
2,Too big,"I normally like Oxo products but this one is unwieldy even when I'm cooking a pound or two of spaghetti in a big pot. It's hard to describe why; it just feels bulky and awkward. Also, we store utensils like this vertically and its fat handle takes up too much space. Every time I use it or put it away, I regret having lost my normal-sized spaghetti spoon."
1,Mr.,After my usual reviews of products on Amazon I bought this product based on what customers said and my need. I must say that I'm not satisfied with this replacement battery as I am still getting messages saying that my battery (although fully charged) is out of juicy!!!! Not sure what to make of it.
5,Well-crafted homemade music by a funny guy,"As my most recent acquisition of REK's music (now at 7, but looking for ""Gringo Honeymoon"" and other earlier stuff than this one), it's already a favorite. My preferences lean towards acoustic music (yes, I'm kinda old and am declining in my need for adolescent screaming into a mike). This is just a perfect album with well-crafted, interesting lyrics and beautiful harmonies. REK is known for his humor, and this album has its share, and it's just fun to listen to. Glad I have it, and will listen to it often, especially when I need a boost."
2,Are You All Stupid?,"For 1 thing, Tanner runs like a retard who has forgotten to wipe its arse.2nd of all, the graphics are of sub-par PSone game qualityAVOID WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT!"
2,this suck,the look is great but the game play suck i current belive that i payed 52$ for this game this suck
3,Driv3r is O.K.,"driv3r...well let me start by saying this is not a very fun game,1.you can lose cops on your tail very easily. 2.retarted cars (well...most of them). 3.BORINGthe controls suck...but overall this is an o.k. game"
3,A Game That's Really Hard to Put into Words,"Well, this game is slightly fun due to the realistic graphic vehicle damage. The missions, although, are a different story. So are the music and faulty controls. The music sounds like a toddler banging pots and pans together to make noise. The controls are confusing and unbelievably hard to learn. Also, ESRB made a huge mistake rating this game mature in the first place, as it doesn't even contain blood, drugs, sexual content, or even one single swear word like all the other ""m"" rated games. Overall, this game shouldn't even be considered a game in my opinion. Go ahead and buy it if you want to be bored out of your mind."
2,Dont bother,"Its just trying to be GTA, with none of the pizzaz of the other game. I thought the best thing was to drive around miami and see how close they got it, which unfortunetly wasnt that accurate. Being from South Florida I can see where the mistakes are... dont bother wasting your money. Just go buy San Andreas."
2,Disappointing!!!,"I had high expectations for this game because it took so long for it to be released. I figured the extra time was going to be used to perfect the game. Apparently it wasn't.The graphics are nothing spectacular. I was disappointed.The only thing that seemed to be different about the cars was the way they looked. All of the cars seemed to drive at the same speed, which wasn't fast enough. A sports cars should fly down the road, but in this game a sports car never went that fast.The handling is horrible!! It is an effort to turn a corner without hitting something.The on foot missions are weak.In all fairness, I only played the game for one hour, so I may grow to like it more, but so far it is not worth buying. Rent it first, if you like it then buy it."
1,stick to the complete season release,"while this is a ok release, even my kids agree that the ones with scrapy doo are just no good. it was the introduction of scarpy doo that spelled the end of saturday morning cartoons. why this hated little dog was added to the show i'll never know, but it says something that the live action movie used this little runt as the bad guy. no one i have ever met likes scrapy and my boys will not watch any of the movies or shows with him in it. as for the other shows on the disc you can find them on the complete 1st and 2nd season releaseand the othe one from the new scooby doo show in the late 70's may be on the scooby doo dinomutt show release. scrapy is just the worst cartoon ever created and almost did what no one has been able to do, kill off scooby dooand it's worth noteing that the new what's new scooby doo does not have scrapy(we used to call him crapy when i was growing up) in it!!!!!!!!"
1,it's the old scooby doo,"I thought it was a newer scooby doo movie, but it turns out it's a few old scooby doo 'winter' episodes. Not that I don't like the old scooby doo's but the pic of this makes it look like the more current version, which I really enjoy."
4,Rock group Love's drummer shares insights,"Michael Stuart-Ware is drummer on two of Love's albums and here shares his insights on the rock group in a coverage of the band's recording and performing career. Love's frontman Arthur Lee has enjoyed much limelight but the group was far more than just his backup group: there were many incarnations and powerful musicians in the band, which Stuart-Ware explores in chapters packed with 'you are there' first-person experiences. LOVE: BEHIND THE SCENES ON THE PEGESUS CAROUSEL WITH THE LEGENDARY ROCK GROUP LOVE is a lively survey of a long-lasting, popular rock group which has played for decades."
1,"If you have this kind of money to play with, who needs comp?","I'm not sure if I'm reading the same book as the one read by all the 'positive' reviewers here. What I was hoping for when I ordered, was some insight into how someone with a relatively small (at least in the casino's eyes) bankroll could find places to exploit the comp systems at the casinos. Instead, I found the book was 90% geared towards 'high-rollers' who would be able to play blackjack for hours at $100 per hand.In my casino experiences, if you have the bankroll to play at that level, a) you have enough money that comps don't matter and/or b) the casino will make certain that you get the 'attention' you deserve.There was nothing that I found useful for the smaller player. Things mentioned are common sense to most players."
2,for kids only,"This is by far one of the worst games in 2004. I say this because it's barely any fun. You can't go into a single building, too many invisible walls, non- realistic, bad gameplay graphics, horrible shooting controls, things appear out of nowhere too quickly. For instance, I was being chased by cops, I took a shortcut, and a cop fell right on my car. Also, unlike Grand Theft Auto, only cops come after you, no S.W.A.T, CIA, the army, only cops. I only give this game a 2 because kids who aren't allowed GTA Vice City, this is mildly fun for about five minutes."
4,Retard3d,"This game is hilarious me and my father love it to death. but the people in it are dangerously RETARDED they run in front of cars and they drive into buildings killing themselves. it is a just for laughs game, therefore it is nothing like GTA but it is not a waste of money because it is crazy and funny.LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A sense of presence,I have enjoyed using this CD as background music for my massage therapy. Many people have commented on how well-recorded it is. There is a presence of sound that is rare among any CD. His playing is clear and meditative. The music is soothing.
2,I like everything OXO Good Grip - EXCEPT this,"This is awkward. It is sturdy and easy to grip, like all OXO products, but it doesn't fit into a utensil pitcher well. It is hard to get out of drawers because of the size and the shape of the handle. I rarely use it and that surprised me because normally I'm a pretty big fan of this company's products."
2,Item received is not as shown in the picture. Can't use it as it is delivered.,The picture shows a male and female hose fitting along with two hose clamps. Those are NOT included with the 1101 adapter that I received.You must have the two fittings to be able to cut your existing PowerBleeder hose then be able to use both your existing adapter and the universal adapter #1101. The PowerBleeder doesn't have a compatible fitting that this will connect to!
2,Madman Across the Water,"Except for the title track I hated every minute of it....After Tumbleweed Connection,which I still own and consider to be E.J.'s best album,it was a huge letdown.....There are some E.J.songs I've liked from other albums,but none since Tumbleweeds that I can play right to the end..."
1,Suck Face,"I can't stand this guy's music! I admit I bought his albums up to 1974, but got rid of them shortly thereafter, and never heard them again, mainly because they were all over the radio all the time, and I got sick and tired of hearing Elton's flat vocals and Bernie Taupin's stupid lyrics. Can you tell I'm not a fan?"
5,Great album--but correction on editor,"John, Taupin and Buckmeister at their best.However, Steve Gdula has it wrong about the origin of Madman.... Yes, the song was recorded for Tumbleweed Connection but was not released with the album, until the remastered version with extra cuts.And it surprises me how many find the drek of Elton John's later pop career (ever actually sat through embarrassments like Rock of the Westies?) superior to his early work.Some excellent and enjoyable work in albums like Don't Shoot Me... and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, but there's a sense from Honky Chateau on that Elton John and Bernie Taupin were purposely dumbing down their work so they could make the big bucks.Certainly understandable, but a shame to see them stop exercising their artistic muscle."
4,Finally......,"Finally available in stereo and with bonus tracks. This originally came out when I was a sophmore in college in 1972, and at the time I was pleasantly surprised, since A. Clarke was no longer the lead singer. After my first listen, that was fine with me! I just rec'd. my copy from Amazon (just releaaed on August 20), and couldn't wait to listen again. Melody, harmony, musicianship, Abbey Road Studio sound, well produced and great memories......and my favorite Hollies album."
3,Difficult to clean,"This Potato Masher from OXO does a super job of mashing potatoes but has a few disadvantages over the traditional wire masher. Since the tines on the nylon masher are very narrow, the potatoes get easily clogged. The small tines also make it difficult to clean. OXO also makes the traditional wire masher out of stainless steel with the OXO grip. That's the one to get."
2,Bulky and hard to clean,"I am usually a big fan of OXO, and this gadget does turn out decent mashed potatoes and guacamole, but it is hard to clean unless you IMMEDIATELY put it in water to soak after you use it. The bars are too high and too close together, and if it does not soak, the potatoes or avocados will make a crusty hard film that is really hard to get off - even a spin in the dishwasher doesn't really help. It's also really bulky - if I could do it again, I would choose a different potato masher."
2,Better off using a fork,"I purchased this because I didn't have a potato masher, but I find that it's too lightweight to do the job. The plastic skids off of my vegetables constantly and barely mashes them at all. Am tossing this one in the garbage and buying a metal one. I suppose it'll work fine if your vegetables are super smushy already, but otherwise, skip this."
2,COMA IS A MEDICAL MISFIRE,"A&E's four hour reworking of Robin Cook's COMA suffers from unnecessary padding like the bizarre psycho stalker subplot) and a lack of strong leading performances. Lauren Ambrose and Steven Pasquale don't have a lot of chemistry or conviction. Ellen Burstyn's looney curator may be her worst performance ever and name stars like James Wood, Richard Dreyfuss and Geena Davis collect paychecks. Makail Salomon's direction uses too many pointless detours and chase scenes that are more annoying than suspenseful. Ultimately, COMA seems an unnecessary retread, making the original seem a classic in comparison."
4,An Enjoyable Thriller,"Not many mini-series are created anymore, and that is quite a shame. It's a very unique and interesting way to tell a story. It takes more time to watch than a movie, but it can give you quite a payoff in the end. A&E's ""Coma"" does just that. It keeps you on your toes as the suspense and paranoia build and build with every waking minute. It definitely delivers the chills and thrills as you continue to watch. Trust me, this won't put you to sleep."
2,Hard to follow,"I enjoy tai chi but when working with an instructor on video/DVD, it is so much easier for me if they let me ""mirror"" them. Meaning we move opposite sides of the body, they move left, I move right, so we face each other. I have the DVD and after trying to use it twice (and I am not new to Tai-Chi) I couldn't be bothered any more."
1,NOT A GOOD INTRO INTO TAI CHI,"I feel a bit releived after reading some of the reviews on here. I thought I was too uncoordinated to get this down, but the left to right on this DVD is REALLY confusing. Once I get messed up, there's no getting it back. I DO NOT recommend this for anyone who is just starting out. It's not easy to pick up the flow. He goes from showing you the name of the movement and how to it, to telling you to mix them all together by name. I'm sorry, but when I am learning a movement, I can't remember what to do after only being told once. I am paying more attention to the movements and doing them correctly than I am to the names of them! I'm just left frustrated and wondering which DVD I should start with instead!"
2,I find this presenter hard to follow.,"I have several T'ai Chi dvds and truly enjoy the practice. I found this presenter hard to follow, and had I realized he was the the presenter on the dvd, would not have purchased it. There are other presenters out there who are a lot easier to follow and present in a way that I can truly understand and learn from."
2,Not a well thought out DVD,"My wife got me this DVD to help me get back into a routine. I did T'ai Chi some 10 years ago and was looking to get back into it. I don't like the way this DVD is set up. The instruction moves too fast and (though it's a minor complaint) the moves are not mirrored to your position in front of the TV, like the better Yoga DVDs are. The way the video is shot doesn't really show the proper positioning of the forms, I didn't like the fact that the moves are bunched together in groups of 5 and there is no warm up to speak of.I would not recommend this to a friend."
2,Horribly Shot,"Besides what other reviewers mention about the confusion of ""left"" and ""right"", the camera work is also terrible. It is often shot from a mixed angle that makes it almost impossible to grok what is going on without watching the video many times. Instead of mirroring what is going on (whether you are confused about the left or the right), you have to try and study what is happening. You don't get a mirror image of what you are doing because of the peculiar angle much of this was shot in. It's quite frustrating. This isn't the first poorly put together Gaiam video I've seen. Those guys really can't get it done right.I gave it two stars, because the instructor seems quite good. Unfortunately the technical aspects of the video forfeit his effort."
1,PAID FOR - NEVER RECEIVED,Notified them that they used the wrong address for the type of shipping they used. But never received it. Paid for but Not received. Will Not shop here again.
4,"nice, quite, delicate book","nice, quite, delicate book; its good break after criminals, thrillers or historical novels. I spend a lovely time when i read this book"
4,Very Good Condition,This book was in the condition as stated. It was definitelt worth what I paid for it. Thank you very much.
3,It was an OK season,It just didn't live up to the standards of the previou seasons...which was kinda expected especially after loosing almost all of the main characters.
3,Being Human,"I really did love this show, until the characters started changing and the story line took off in a different direction. Bring back all the old characters. They were great. The new ones are ok, but don't think I""ll be watching this show if it continues on the same path."
3,I love this show but ..,Now that you gotten rid of the 4 original cast members its really weird to watch .. may have to watch it again in its entirety
1,Madacy Should Be Ashamed,"Some of the titles in Madacy's new Drive-In double feature series are decent-enough quality. This disc, however, is unwatchable. The ""Beast"" transfer is washed out, with video and black levels far out of spec. The transfer itself appears to have come from a bad 3rd generation VHS. ""Brain"" is equally horrific... out of focus most of the time, with the framing too tight and off center, as if the producers simply set up a video camera and shot the image off of a television set. The TRAILERS included for both films are actually much better quality than the features. Save your money."
1,"Other reviews said it right - inconsistent quality, wrong length","I should definitely have heeded the warnings of others. I ordered a pair of the 517s and upon receiving them, was rather dismayed that indeed the length was way off. Upon measurement, the inseam is 31.5"" instead of the 30"" that I ordered, and what the jean claims to be. Back to Amazon it goes. Such is the QA of a global brand. People have been fired for way less.The search for the perfect fit continues."
5,Absolutely Awesome,"Living only two towns away in LI when this murder(s)occured, I could not be more aware of all the hype, changing scenarios, gossip, etc. that went down, as we all talked about this for about two years after it happened. This book brings to light one very startling fact by a juror who makes an incredible discovery/comparison. It settles my mind for sure. The book is awesome and I highly recommend it for all the first hand info, direct testimony, etc. I could not put the book down and read it in 3 days, and with my busy schedule. I actually did not want it to end. It is also the first time one can read about the extended family (aunt, grandfather) which I always wanted to read about but never came across. Like Butch stated not too long ago - ""no demons, no ghosts, just cold blooded murder"". And drugs at the bottom of it for sure."
2,Yawn Fest,"The first part of this book kept me reading, when it got to the trial it turned into a big brag fest about the author, who was also the prosecutor. It turned into all about him and what he did, like he was patting himself on the back it wasn't about the victims at the end but all about him."
1,An empty glass,"This film is a sorry excuse for a documentary. 90% of the time all there are segments of random events that Glass is involved in, wether it is a phone call, plugging in his VCR, walking down the street while talking about things unrelated to his music, and other times where nobody is really saying anything. This film seems like the material that ordinarily would have been left on the cutting room floor. I was very much let down by this film, since I am a serious Glass fan. I expected much more than this drivel!! Total joke!"
4,Excellent Acting!,I saw this movie to see Colleen and Megan in a very different role from 'Anne of Green Gables'... well I was not dissapointed... lol The story felt very real... it was sad and depressing... but liked the end. The acting abilities of these two women sure impressed me though... especially Megan's performance in several scenes. I gave this 4 stars only because the sound of the movie...it wasn't very good and sometimes I had to turn up the volume to catch what they were saying. I loved the music playing at the beginning! :)
5,Can't Serve Pie Without It,"Unless, like us, you try to serve it with a regular knife and then have to scrape the leftovers onto your plate. Not very attractive when serving guests. OXO tools are well built and easy to use and this server is no exception."
5,dmw,this an encyclopedia that is great to have in your personal library. it can be of great use as a research tool for younger children and teens alike.
1,what,wow 5 episodes? and the packaging.. isnt even the same as the first season.. why are they shorting us with these?i couldnt imagine the 2nd season actually being only 5 episodes.
1,Sad!,"I'm so sad about this book. I was really looking forward to reading it. However, the writing was so distracting because of incomplete sentences and poor punctuation, I could not get thru the first chapter. This obviously British author either tried to reinvent proper English (mistaking it for his 'literary style', or he never bothered learning it in the first place! I wish I could have gotten further into the story to at least be able to comment on it, but his grammar style was just too distracting. Needless to say, I am just happy I didn't spend good money for this book."
5,"Read, then act on this!!!","This book spells out easily and completely the way to take charge and improve your health now. If you never start, you will not begin to reverse the years of food, chemical, and environment poisoning that your body has become accustomed to leading to the onset of the major diseases and ill health conditions that his generation is experiencing in proportions never before known.In conjunction with other Wheatgrass and Ann Wigmore books, I feel better without medicine or pharmaceuticals of any kind in only a few short weeks. I lost 15 pounds the first two weeks without strenuous dieting. My craving for sweets has disappeared without any thought or struggle. Understanding these simple practices of biology is made easy through these books fromthe Hippocrates Institute."
5,MUST SEE!,"No film portrays a more urgent and accurate picture of what is needed in today's activism, especially concerning the planets less than favorable state, than Franlkin Lopez's END:CIV.BUY THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IT!"
5,CHEVERISIMA,"ESTA CAMISA AL IGUAL QUE OTRA CAMISA QUE ME LAS TRAJE,SON CHEVERISIMAS,COLORES LINDOS,PRECIOS BUENOS,IGUAL LOS PUEDES UTILIZAR CON UNOS JEANS O CON UNA ROPA FORMAL..RECOMENDADA.."
3,"It Works, But.......","I have been searching for the ""best"" bore claner to remove carbon and lead deposits from stainless steel bores and revolver chambers. ""Best"" to me means complete residue removal with minimal amount of brushing & rubbing. It's like searching for the perfect car wax. All cleaners that I have tried to date fall into two classes, petroleum based or detergent based. The former are toxic (to humans & the enviroment, no doubt), have a strong odor, require ventilation and have a tendency to run all over the place. The S&W cleaner is in this category. Also, one should wear rubber gloves using this solvent. If I am outdoors, I would use this cleaner, as it is effective (I would rate it - very good, but not ""best"", in my opinion) and it dosen't leave your firearm smelling ""funny"" as some other petroleum based cleaners can do. However, for cleaning indoors in a small area, my preference is for a detergent based cleaner, which has no odor and can be cleaned up with soap & water."
2,Far too small!,"This is too small for a betta. It will sit on the gravel all it;s life and will not be entertaining. This small bowl will also need FREQUENT water changes, which is a pain for you, and stressful on your pal. Putting something in this chamber is not only obviously stupid, but cruel. All animals need space, and with just a few dollars more, get at least a 3 gallon tank, it will be entertaining for you and your pal will be greatful."
5,Small and handy bag!,"I bought the Tamrac bag because of its size. I don't like to carry unnecessarily bulky items so the bag was perfect for my Canon Rebel XT dSLR. I can fit the camera and the lens in (side by side) and the front pocket is great for the charger, memory cards, spare battery and my Canon pocket user guide. Other cables fit perfectly in the side pockets. The bag is also very sturdy.This bag is a great buy, definitely recommended!"
5,Incredibly thought provoking and original...,"This book is one of the most thought provoking, challenging books I've come across in many years. Simon tosses off ideas like a Border Collie shaking off water. This is not a book to be skimmed, or to be taken lightly, but a slow careful reading will certainly pay off. I read this book for insights into product design, and it did not disappoint."
3,"It's SCIFI, but JET LI is REAL.","This movie dissappoints me, but it's because I'm an Asian. I've seen his great real action in many other HongKong movies, and also known he was one fo the yngest champ in a martial art contest in China. It proves he's real. This movie is just like any other American SCIFI movie. But it tries to appeal it's more like a martial art movie with Jet Li's action. Unfortunately, it doesn't work to me. If you wanna see nice SF, then you'll be satisfied with this movie. If you wanna see his real martial art without any SF, then you should get ""Shaolin Temple"" which is the eariest movie of Jet Li."
5,The One,"I really enjoyed this movie.It had very good special effects and a nice story.Sure,It doesn't beat The Matrix in term of originality,but it's still a movie you should buy if you're a fan of Jet Li or if you like martial arts."
4,AWESOME,"i haven't bought the DVD, but idid see the movie the day it came out. it had awesome action scenes and an even better plot!!! i rate it four stars because it copied the matrix a little. BUT<<< Doesn't every new action movie copy the matrix in a way? They always say "" Best action stunts since the matrix"" ANYWAY this is a good movie and if ur a fan of the matrix or if not, you should buy it. i am"
4,Worth Owning,The One is a really good action flick. Not too much on story though. While this movie is nowhere near as good as Kiss of the Dragon it has some really cool special effects and is worth owning in my opinion.
2,If all you're looking for is a**whuppin' martial arts and...,"wonderful special effects then you'll love this movie. However if you'd like some story with your movie then you're going to be a bit dissapointed. The One was beautifully done and the idea is great. It's just that the story is just a front for the action, not the action being a part of the story. I love Kung Fu movies and I love Sci Fi. I was hoping for a skilled marrying of the genres a la the Matrix. I would watch it again as a special effects/martial arts flick, but I wish I hadn't bought it."
3,Theres Not Just One You !!!,Its seems no one cant beat up jet li maybe he should fight himself?One of the mnay jet li films I didn't like for one the whole idea of fighting himself was kinda retarded.It was cool to see something new from jet li the man himself but the movie didn't display alot of action just focusing on Timetravel and differen't events.Don't get me wrong its good but from the movie I expected to be better then it is.
1,crap crap crap crap crap,big rip-off of The Matrix. has an interesting plot and does nothing with it. 1 star for The One.i rule
2,The One,"At first, The One seemed to be a pretty good movie. It had Jet Li in it and it had awesome special effects. But the ending was horrible! The title of the movie is called THE ONE! shouldnt there be only one in the end? they were tryin to change the ways of Hollywood by making a open ended ending and its good that they tried... but in doing so... they messed this movie up so much! ppl told me that this movie [was bad] and while i was watching it... i thought it was pretty good... but now... i see wat they mean... knowin that its the same ppl that made matrix.... i think they thought they could get away makin another movie like it and make big bucks off of this and try to put in a sequel... these greedy [people] ruined the entire movie!!!"
3,"Lame Movie, Hilarious Ending!","The production values are high, but what they produce is crap. The ending is so bad it's awesome with dialogue like: ""I am Yu-Law...I don't need to know you, YOU need to know ME! I will be The One"".Even the fight scenes aren't entertaining. The only saving grace is that the core idea of the story is cool (i.e. killing all your alternate reality selves results in ultimate power), but in the end it's basically just a merging of the TV show ""Sliders"" and ""Rumble In The Bronx"".Honestly, I would have paid to see a 90 minute version of the last 28 seconds of the film where the evil Yu-Law kicks the crap out of thousands of convicts that attack him atop a pyramid on a prison planet. No story, just silly, over the top action."
2,Not as described,"Returned because it came with no markings at all, although the description and picture clearly indicate both english and metric scales on beam. The locking device (on the side that can't be seen in the picture) is a big, yellow, poorly molded, rough-turning PLASTIC screw. Description should really say, ""Beechwood and plastic construction."""
2,Not as advertised,"Although there is not much information about the product, reviews lead you to believe that it is the original movie soundtrack which includes some dialog from the movie. It claims to be exactly like the original vinyl record. Well... it is not. Reviews claiming that it is are false and miss guiding The sound quality also leaves much to desire."
2,uneven grind & messy,"I bought this machine a couple of years ago due to the great reputation of KitchenAid products, (I own 3 others) however, this grinder is mediocre when it comes to performance. First of all, every batch I put in, large or small load, is very unevenly ground. Powder at the bottom and large mostly whole pieces at the top. It doesn't seem to matter how long or short a time I pulse it. Also, the fine powdery grains fly up and under the the edge of the lid making a mess all over the base and the countertop while the machine is running. Either the lid is poorly designed or just a bad fit. And, I don't reccommend it for use on spices, what a mess. I have since purchased a different brand of grinder put out by the Food Network. It works great! Very evenly grinds everything you put into it. And the lid covering the grinding chamber is screwed on so no more leaky mess. I love all of my other KitchenAid appliances but this one is a big disappointment."
4,NCIS eighth season,It appeared to be more complex and held my attention better. Tony seemed to mature a little and after all these years he should get rid of some of the nonsense. Overall I liked it very much.
2,the fifth disk,the fifth disk wont play the rest were fine. i bought this set new and was disipointed with this i expected better
5,NCIS,I love the series. The DVDs in this series have all been in great shape and I've had no trouble with watching them.
1,"For the price, this gun shouldn't have broken so easily.","My son has had it for about a year and treasures this gun. One time, he lets his friend use it and the thing is now busted in half at the stock. His friend wasn't being rough with it, and clearly from inspecting where the gun has snapped this thing is not made for durability. Even before this incident, the cylinder for the caps wasn't seating very well."
3,Christmas present,"It had some kind of sticky stuff on it that I had to clean off, but it will serve its purpose."
3,Not as many plays as I hoped for,"The description of this purchase said the volume included about 6 or more of Ibsen's works. However, upon recieving the book I discovered only 3 of Ibsen's works were included. I was buying the book for the main play of ""A Doll House"" but I was looking forward to having the other plays as well. Nice printing, just not as many plays as expected."
4,Just Bill,"Bill Morrissey is one of the best folks I have ever seen on stage. His music is the BEST, period. I know he has had some good shows and we could say ""not his best"". I have seen both. However you can't take a thing away from Bill, because he is as good as it gets. This CD is solid as the rest of his CD's. How I wish I could see him again. We miss you Bill !!!!!!!"
1,NO GOOD,Had to send item back would not even programme anything! amazon does not even cary it any more so do not konw if I just got a bad one or what. I guess i will never know. bummer though sounded like a nice remote
2,"Ok, but there is better",This is good for the price but unfortunately it won't work with my Dish DVR. Won't even lear the codes. Want a great universal Remote? Try the Logitech Harmony 510. A bit more expensive but worth the money.
4,Very good grinder,"This is a excellent coffee grinder..the only thing I would want different is one that adjusts to fine, med,. course grounds..You can mostly figure how long to run it to adjust the texture of the ground you want..Also very nice modern looking design.."
2,Buy this if you enjoy tedious cleaning,"What were they thinking? Most kitchenaid products are attractive, well designed, and work in just the way you want. Although this one does a reasonable job of grinding (how hard can it be?), it creates such a mess that you will wish you hadn't because the cap doesn't fit tight. Even the most careful grinding spreads powder everywhere, especially in the hard-to-reach places of this device. The only reason for the second star is that you can remove the bowl (fortunate, given the mess it creates). Give this loser a pass."
5,Wonderful Grinder,"I have owned a number of grinders in the past and this one is by far the best. I grind everything from coffee beans to flax seed and it does a wonderful job on each. If I am doing herbs and I want to grind more than I can use at one time I put a sandwich baggie over the stainless steel container, grind and then just turn it around and dump right into the baggie. This method keeps everything nice and clean and I just use what I want and just put the rest it in the freezer or refrigerator for the next time.I won't reiterate some of the positives of others but just add to a couple of likes and a dislike.The blade can be replaced if needed.Strong motor - 200 watts of power.The only minor thing that I dislike is that it could come with a little longer power cord."
2,Mess Maker,"My wife must have nearly one of every red Kitchen Aid products. All function will and are built to last. But the only one to make a bigger mess on my counter is the stand mixer when it has too much flour and is run on high. I grind 1/4c. beans and it escapes either during the grind if I don't have the lid fully pressed or when I release the lid. This beauty is built to last and does look good on the counter. My last Starbucks grinder failed because of a frayed cord(from wrappping around the cylinder). The Kitchen Aid grinder has a high quality cord like my Porter Cable tools. Unfortunately it will last forever. Messy, messy, messy."
3,Little messy,"I have to agree with other reviewers that this grinder does make a little mess if you are not carefull. Basically, the coffee powder stick to the cover and when you remove the cover and put it on the table, you have coffee powder on table. So I always put the grinder and the clear plastic on top of a paper tower for easy cleaning after. I havent try the Cuisinart coffee grinder so I can't say anything about it, all I heard it is good and compariable to the KitchenAid. I bought this from Amazon. Now I wish I had bought both of them from a local store, go home try them out and return the one I don't like."
2,Messy and can't grind spices,I bought this because KitchenAid ususally has wonderful applainces. I would not trade my food processor or stand mixer or dishwasher for that matter for anything. This grinder however is horrible. It is messy with inevitable cleanup of the counter necessary after every grind. i finally bought a new one of a different brand and made the kitchenaid my spice grinder but it could not grind smaller quantities of spices and still made a huge mess putting spice dust everywhere as the seal on the lid is not perfect and it has a wierd static effect where everything clings to the side. I would not reccommend this at all. It did however do a decent job of evenly grinding the coffee i put into it which is why i gave it two stars.
3,Grinds great but is messy,"All the reviews had one major complaint, that it is messy. I tried grinding coffee beans and also the spices. End result was the same. You get finely ground product but the grains do come out and get in to the edges. It is definitely a design flaw. Yes it is small, cool looking and grinds great but cleaning is mess. Also you need to keep the top lid pressed to run the grinder (which I am sure yawl know). So if you do not have it pressed firmly(all the way down) then chances are that the grains are going to sneak out. I am going to return this and buy something more practical."
5,Great shaving cream,"I'm a 28 year old Asian male who has sensitive skin. I shave every couple days with a Merkur razor and Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream. I've tried many shaving creams such as Nivea, Aveeno, Gillette Gels, Polo Sport, and Neutrogena Shaving lotion and none of them have out-performed this product. I also like the fact that is unscented so it doesn't clash with my aftershave, deodorant, or cologne.This particular product is more expensive than most shaving creams, but you won't need to use a large amount of it. It doesn't irritate my skin and leaves my face smooth. I've always had a close clean shave while using this shaving cream with a single blade safety razor."
5,country boyz kill,"tommy is the hardest rapper out memphis besides fly, bone is fake, tommy is original, and he may be country, but i guarantee he would bust anybody head from chino, cali, esp. you marquis ekanem"
2,WAT?????????,"I heard soooooo much hype about this so i bought it (stupidly without listening to any samples but the title song). It was horrible, and im not saying that b/c i totally support Tom DeLonge's work (Box Car Racer, AVA). This album had only five good songs (respectively---) 1)Make You Smile 2)When Your Heart Stops beating 3)Lycanthrope 4)155 5)No, It Isn't Every other song stunk Unless you feel the need to collect every album made by Blink members, dont buy this before listening to some of the sample either on YouTube or on Amazon. Im seeling mine on Ebay its a disgrace to my collection"
3,A Bit Disapointed...,"Ok, to be fair, (+44) have released a decent, solid rock CD. But the problem is that on tracks ""Weatherman"", ""No It Isn't"", and the one minute song ""Interlude"", (+44)'s music can be very boring. You can clearly see that Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker are missing Tom DeLonge.But on the other hand, they've released some songs that wouldn't sound out of place on blink-182's self titled cd, such as the Synth Rock anthem, ""155"", or the album's namesake, the track ""When Your Heart Stops Beating"".I would say overall, (+44) are decent, but they can't match up to Tom DeLonge's new band, Angels & Airwaves."
3,"Great at first, then it turned an unattractive yellow","We have our computer on our kitchen bar area and I wanted an unobtrusive mouse pad that blended with the white countertop. This was perfect for the first few months but gradually turned a yellowish gray color that just looks dirty now. Since I didn't use cleaners on it I assume the discoloration is caused from exposure to direct sunlight, so perhaps it wouldn't happen for everyone."
5,best bluray 3D video ever,"I've watched many 3D videos, 3D games and this is the best one that really brings the sea and animals right in front of your face like in those disney theaters.I watched it using 82 inch 3D TV and dynaudio speakers. The video is sharp and color is so vivid. The music comes so fit with the animals. The only complain is that it is only 40 min long.Overall, i recommend this movie and it is the best to showcase your 3D TV.BTW, i got it from Groupon for 13 dollars only."
2,max under the sea,"This dvd was not as good as I thought it would be. the quality of the film was ok, but not what I thought."
4,Vibrant 3D Video of Sealife,Excellent video. Amazing views of fish and coral. Well narrated by Jim Carey. Vibrant colors. This video really shows off the attributes of 3D television. My family thoroughly enjoyed watching this video.
2,So-So Quality and More or Less Boring,"It might be better to see it on the big screen, but compared to other 3-D DVDs that I have, this DVD has a cheap visual quality. Some of the scenes are good, but overall this is boring. It did not even hold interest for my grandchildren."
5,3D HD Imax--it doesn't get any better,Imax under the sea. The colors are fabulous. Imax lives up to its reputation for excellent filming. Under the sea in 3D is almost like being there.
3,it's ok..,it's ok..but not great 3D..it has some 3d issues around the corner of the picture in most of scenes and create eye strain.
3,loved the sealife,"This was a very well made film, except that there was so much more that could have been and should have been included, like clown fish and lion fish and a miriad of sealife that live in these waters. Jim Carry's narration was outstanding, and I hope to hear him do something like this again."
4,Beautiful,This is peaceful and the colors are beautiful. I saw it another doctors office and got it for mine.It doesn't repeat like some do. It is less than an hour long.I would like it if better if it repeated.
3,Imax Under the Sea 3D,"Very nice film done in IMAX in Under the Sea that captures some of the unique sea creatures in 3D. However, they should film more about the Coral Reef fish which is more colorful and desired."
3,IMax Movie,"The movie was interesting, but I thought at the time I was buying a 3D movie. OK for viewing if you only have HD TV"
1,"Poor 3d, bad script","Wow, I really wanted to like this movie, and bought it off of the reviews. But sadly this is just a bad movie in almost every aspect. There are moments when the 3d works and things look good, but 75% of the time you find yourself straining to focus and unable to see what is going on. It is one big eye strain. My wife had the same terrible experience with this movie. On top of that, the script and Jim Carry's voice over is horrible. I have a 2012 LG 55"" passive tv, and other 3d looks fabulous on it (such as Prometheus). I wish I hadn't bought this movie, and I'm at a complete loss as to why so many people seem to think this is a good 3d movie."
1,not what I expected,"I ordered this item because I thought it was advertised as 3D blue ray. I does not appear to be. I emailed the seller, but never got a response."
5,Absolutely the Most Stunning & Beautiful Underwater Photography,IMAX: Under the Sea [Blu-ray] The underwater photography in this IMAX Blu-Ray film is absolutely beautiful. I love it as does my Sister. I am getting this blue-ray as a Christmas present for her. I highly recommend this informative & entertaining film.
5,Just like swimming in the ocean!,Movie is very life-like. Just like swimming in the ocean. Worth every dime. IMAX and Amazon came through again. Thank you!
4,"great 3D effects & good in 2D also, educational, just overly priced & too short","I enjoyed the movie. I bought it mainly to show off my 55"" Vizio 3D 1080p Full Array LCD LED HDTV 480Hz & this is definitely the movie I would show off to friends & family coz of very good 3D effects & awesome also in 2D=so crisp & clear images, eye popping on 3D-like an open window looking thru, & they go close to your eyes. It's just a bit costly for a short movie. I wish also it was longer like 2hrs-would have been nice for the price. I like it a lot & will watch it several times just like my other favorite Blu-ray 3D movies I recently bought also such as: The Ultimate Wave-Tahiti 3D, IMAX: Deep Sea 3D, Legend of the Guardians 3D, Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs 3D, Tron Legacy 3D, & My Bloody Valentine 3D"
3,Very Interesting,"Well actually because it said IMAX I thought it was in 3D.So, I was dissappointed because its not...It was interesting to watch, but it would have been lots better in 3D"
4,"Realistic & comfy, but didn't include mixing stick","I guess I should have checked first but I started the process (opened the capsule and put the drops in) and then realized there was no mixing stick as mentioned in the instructions. I struggled to find something appropriate to use and ended up having a hard time. One tooth set well, the other I may need to redo. The fangs look very realistic though, they are slightly more yellow then my teeth but I use whitening stuff. So far they are comfortable but I haven't worn them for any length of time. My teeth & mouth are very small and the fangs appear to fit just fine and look appropriately sized. When ordering I was worried the fangs would be too small but if they were any bigger they would look too big in my mouth.I would recommend these to females and children but men may want something bigger/more dramatic."
5,Best fangs I've ever tried!,"These fangs are awesome. Relatively easy to mold to your teeth, clip in and out just like they say they will. I wear them a lot and they're still going strong! Can't eat with them of course, but you can sure bite with them! :)"
2,One reason to buy this CD.,"This is Hawaiian music done very well. Darnall is a master arranger and player of string instruments. Most songs could be background music. However! Over the Rainbow is pure genius. Unforgettable. I would use the word, haunting. I think Judy Garland would approve."
4,Flax Grinder,"After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase this product for grinding mostly flax seed...works great with alot of power tho a little messy...ground seed slips over and out the sides while grinding and is all over the inside of the cap, and some on the machine itself, when done. Easily cleaned so if and when this one ever konks out, I would purchase another one, without hesitation."
4,Does a fair job,"I like the way this product looks and I like the large container, since I make large pots of coffee. However, it does not grind beans as well or quickly as other products I have owned. The blade is further from the bottom, and maybe that's it. I don't know why, but I have to grind the beans for close to a minute to reach the consistency I like. My last grinder, a smaller, cheaper product, was more efficient and lasted about ten years."
4,all men cant be dogs,i saw this one over the weekend i love this one it was so good. love almost all the actors i just didnt see no reason why the son was there just a waste of a check.
3,Engagingly bland,I found the play to have a slow start and once it got going to be engagingly bland. Some viewers may enjoy it. I found the play to be so-so. Sorry
4,Impressed,I rented this from Amazon online & I liked it. The actors were good and not over the top. The play also had a relateable scenario. I would definetly recommend it.
3,"the good, the bad and the ugly","james last's music ranges from beautiful to idiotic in this compilation of 'hits' from his previous albumstake the wonderfully played 'the importance of your love' followed by stupid disco version of 'the street where you live'.apparently james last shared the same band members as bert kaempfert during the 70's, although continued to make separate albums - in germany, and some of the numbers quite similar, although kaempfert never went to the disco-jazz like james last appreciably"
4,A wonderful story of love and loss.,Kristin Hannah's always good. Truly human emotions related so eloquently. A journey that brings characters to realizationsabout themselves and others.
4,Just watch Toonami if you want Dragonball Z,"Dang, if you want to watch DBZ just watch Toonami. Yeah I watched the uncut version and trust me it is not all that It is the same there are just a few things you can spot but not anything major. Any way if you want martial arts anime wait for Real Bout High School on DVD."
4,nice looking bag but...,"I really like the flexibility of this bag. For those days when I'm traveling light I can cinch it down to a messenger style and for those other days I can just leave it uncinched and put a ton of stuff into it. The shoulder strap is very comfortable. However, the pink sketch color picks up dirt very easily and I don't think I overly abuse the bag. The care instructions say to spot clean but doing so does not remove all the dirt. Also, after less than three months of use there is a tiny rip that has formed on the bottom of the bag. For looks and functionality I give this bag 5 stars but for endurance and maintenance I give it 1 star."
1,Extremely Poor Quality,You get what you pay for. This unit's remote is very fragile. Keys constantly stick. The unit has trouble reading just about any disc and is very tempermental. Very cheap feel to the controls. Save your money./
4,Great insight on the dynamics of boys.,"This book was funny and easy to ready. More importantly it was extremely insightful. I loved it. As a single mom, I need really appreciated the candor and no-nonsense approach the author took."
1,not recommended as very one sided,"i started reading this book and became very distraught as the information the book was implying that I am in for all sorts of trouble and my baby will be emotionally unnavailable if he goes to day care before 3 years old. And this is what ig got in the first 30 pages. I also found as I am a single mum, it had little to no consideration to me (2 pages), and most children these days are brought up by separated parents or single parents, and generally the mother is the sole carer. Luckily for me my mum is a psychologist for relationships and children and clearly expained all you need to give is love and good base foundation with clear rules and be available for your son, and also agreed that this book should not be taken as gospel nor correct and it is very one-sided. for a best selling book, i thought it was terrible"
5,"Shorter than the previous 3 discs, alas...still great, tho'","Only twelve ""inimitable songs of Burns"" on this disc, but what songs! The bawdy ""Ode to Spring"" is a welcome inclusion, and ""Where are the Joys"" finishes things off. I treasure every CD in this series, as will fans of Robert Burns and song lovers everywhere."
2,"Good philosophy, poor execution","In this book, Mr. Eichenberger espouses practicing for emergencies to happen and gives some very useful tips on how to accomplish this. However, his advice on how to deal with specific emergencies leaves a lot to be desired. In a few cases, he does not provide correct and accurate information. In others, his recommendations are in poor sequence. Other than for the brand new pilot, I think this book is merely a reiteration of what most pilots already know. He didn't have many stories and learnings from them either. AOPA Pilot's Never Again series is a much better learning mechanism."
1,"Save your money, folks!","Yet another collection of so-called ""Best"" erotica that only seems to be the best in Susie Bright's opinion. To be fair, there might be one or two inclusions that are acceptable. However, it seems to me that this series has run its course several years back and should be given a rest. Where are the true artists of erotic writing? I see no excerpts from M.S. Valentine or Don Winslow or indeed, any recognizable names in the erotic literature field. Does Ms. Bright collect stories from her friends and neighbors? I think this is yet another prime example of overkill. I have loved and read erotica for 25 years and find nothing much positive to say about this book. I would instead recommend to those readers who like a variety of voices, check out Joyful Desires, A Compendium of Twentieth Century Erotica. It is money better spent."
3,Just ok.,"The 3 songs that he wrote when he was in the Doobie Brothers were wonderful, but I don't know what happened here. This album sounds mostly experimental. I was kinda hoping that he would go in more of a soul/fusion direction. At the same time, he's a hell of a musician. Your fellow bassman, Mike Hoelen."
5,"excellent but extremely hard to find, unfortunately!",We know Tiran from the Doobie Bros. Saw him play with Peter Lewis in L.A. I am trying to find a CD. Help! Anyone who knows how to obtain a copy please E-mail me at steroid@mscomm.com Thanks....
3,loved the two cuts from the doobie bros albums but..........,I was hoping tha Tiran porter would come up with some more songs when he was with the doobie brothers. He wrote two songs that were amazing.so when I heard he had a cd out I ordered one that same day hoping to recapture some of that magic that was on takin it to the streets album. but with the exception of the first song I was dissipointed. I guess that when you are sorrounded with such talented people like tommy Johnston and Patrick simmons the blend on tiran is just somthing the cant be recreated without them. You dont know me but Iam still your bro ti.....later
4,Yummy,"These are super cute, but definitly not the height I am used to, but still comfy, just took some getting used to..."
5,Prepare to get caught in the rapture . . .,"I liked this book . . . and I'm an avid reader of non-fiction! The book has such a real-life appeal with Rochelle's descriptions of the New Orleans nightlife, the tastefully erotic interludes, and characters on the edge . . . their actions are believable if you ""think"" about what the author tells you about them -- yet you'll shake your head in disbelief that they can't see what's in store for them. Bourbon & Bliss will definitely stimulate memories of sultry New Orleans for those (of us) who have experienced Body Heat in the Big Easy."
2,Has never made my hair look fuller,"I have thin fine hair and had read a good review of this somewhere so I bought a bottle. I followed the directions to a T, but my hair didn't look any different, but i kept trying thinking maybe one day i'll see that it plumped my hair up for the day, but it never happened. I've tried it 5 times, and it's only supposed to coat the hair for the day, it's not a treatment, but still i have yet to feel like it's doing anything."
2,It's ok but,"Smells nice, very expensive for what it does. You could find products that do as well or better for a better price."
3,Informative but feels like something is missing,"I have this book and Mother of All Pregnancy Books- both by the same author. I have to say with some disappointment that these books seem to be almost the same book.While the author does a good job of trying to cover all the subjects from trying to concieve, to the trimesters, to complications, to special circumstances, to labor, to post partum. It seems everything gets touched on and nothing gets really discussed in depth. I find that after reading on a subject in this book, I am left feeling like I want more on the subject. This is a decent book for overview and probably works well for women who just want the facts and to move on. It really is a good book, just not for my particular needs. For myself, I wanted to read a book that really talks about pregnancy, more personal and feeling. I found The Pregnancy Book by Dr. Sears to be much better. I even found What to Expect to be more indepth into what I wanted to know."
5,"Well organized, and rich in information","This is my favorite pregnancy book. I can find what I am looking for when I have 30 minutes to browse through a favorite topic or 1 minute to answer an immediate question. And it's packed with good information about fertility, pregnancy, preparing for childbirth, preparing for a child, ... Lots of varying opinions are represented and validated - the book is very open to the wide variety of choices a woman may want to make about her pregnancy."
4,Great romance,"When horse rancher Lourdes Quinterez finds a badly beaten man in her barn, she and her family take him in and nurse him back to health. The injured man cannot remember who he is so Lourdes gives him the name of Juan Guapo (Guapo is handsome in Spanish). Although his past is a mystery, Juan is a good man at heart. He and Lourdes soon give in to the passion that is sparking between them.Those of you who have read the Lone Star Country Club series will not be surprised who Juan turns out to really be, for the rest of you, I won't give it away."
3,Review of Sandman Vol. 8,"This is good, but likely my least favorite Sandman so far. It has some of creativity present in the other volumes, but, really, it represents a significant step downward from the peak of inspiration the Sandman is famous for. The format of this volume is the 'story collection' used in earlier volumes, yet, here, to weaker effect. Overall, a decent disappointment."
2,The construct is more important than the tale,"Interesting structure to a series of tales told by travelers stuck at an Inn during a storm. Cantebury Tales was the inspiration and Gaiman employs many levels of stories within stories and even eventually brings the story full circle, which is cheeky. However it seems that the stories were given little precedence and therefore come off very weak. Now part of this is expectation. Fables and Reflections blew me away and may be my fav of the series so I expected this as a series of individual stories to be just as good. So with it being just average I was overly disappointed. There are some good moments and the few appearances of Death and the Endless are captivating. However they are not enough.One note: the end of this book overtly hints at the plot of Kindly One's so if you want to be surprised, read this after that one. I wish Gaiman hadn't done that, myself."
1,NOT SACD!!,"I bought this because AMAZON stated as follows:Product DescriptionJapanese only SHM/SACD paper sleeve pressing. Please note you will need a dedicated SACD player to listen to the disc.Well - this certainly led me to believe that this was a SACD disc. Which, it is not. It's a standard CD and I am no happy at all. I would never have purchased this had I known this was not accurate.What a complete ripoff.EDIT - after a little more research, I guess, officially it is SACD. Come on. Claims to not play in standard player. Don't know about that. Clearly, this disc sounds inferior - even if it were standard CD, I'd be very disappointed. Again, I'm reviewing the sound quality, not the music. All of my ""real"" SACD are advanced resolution and as such generally have superior sound. If this is advanced resolution...... I'm not buying it. If you want this for superior SACD audio, then please, don't bother."
1,Giving this Book Zero Stars...,"Is a *serious* overestimation of its usefulness.Schnobelen claims to have been highly-ranked in several religious organizations (Several of which didn't and don't exist, and at least *three* of which he claimed membership in simultaneously).Several of the other organizations he claims to have joined never even *offered* the services he claims to have obtained.Additionally, Schnobelen is a known disseminator of the 'Satanic Conspiracy' myth.Don't give this book, or this author, a second glace.As someone once said, 'It's not a book to put aside lightly; it should be thrown with great force'.Nothing more needs to be said."
4,"A little known, underrated gem!","Along with English artists like The Move and The Small Faces, Terry Reid was an artist who should have received massive airplay and success in the States, but it was not to be. This album was outstanding for someone so young. His talent and passion could not be held back, even by the absolutely shameful and shoddy production by Mickie Most. After 30 years I still put my vinyl copy on the turntable and play ""Speak Now Or Forever Hold Your Peace"" as loud as I can take it. Truly one of the great rock songs of any period. If you like the singing of Robert Plant, Steve Marriott, Billy Squier, or younger guys like Chris Robinson of Black Crowes, but like something more sensitive and soulful, give Terry Reid a shot. You won't be disappointed. Thank heavens it's now on CD!!"
2,Overhyped product that doesn't deliver,"I reviewed most of the juicers on ... and many other major sites and decided that the KitchenAid was the best product on the market. After receiving it, I changed my mind. Although it promises to be an easy cleanup with a ""special tool"", it is way too hard to clean up. The pulp basket contains a ridge that makes it next to impossible to get out all of the little strains of pulp. The special tool is great for getting out the big stuff, but not the little stuff. Also, there is a TON of juice left over in the pulp that gets thrown away. This is a result of the poor design, which filters the juice through the pulp before exiting. The product had a nice design and looked good on my counter-top, but it did not deliver. I would recommend buying Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer that is available on other sites."
2,Just Not For Me,"I was looking for something more personal, this was more preachy. I since have purchased another daily devotional that I enjoy very much."
2,Morning and Evening: Daily Readings,Disappointed for lack of table of content. I don't remember if the caption for the book stated if there were not toc or not.
5,Very Nice.,The cover is very nice. The pages are like Bible pages paper. There is a ribbon bookmark. It's a nice little size.
2,Disappointing,I am disappointed with this devotional. It is poorly set up and seems to ramble without much to be gleaned. Oswald Chambers work is a much better example of what a great devotional should be and this does not come close.
3,Disappointed,"The threaded rings that hold the glass to the fixture are terrible. They do not fit properly and are very cheap. If I had known this, I would not have purchased. It's something you would expect from a $20 fixture. Fortunatately, we had threaded rings from a fan light that was no longer in use that fit perfectly. The correct size rings are around $1 a piece. I expected better quality for a $100+ light fixture."
1,unreliable seller,This order should be cancelled. The owner emailed me about 3 days after the order and said they did not have the book. Not a good experience with this seller. Will most likely not use them again.Florence
4,God Save the Baco's?,"I bought these for my friend in the UK who asked I bring them next time I came. I don't know how available they are over there, but when I was looking for them, seems like a lot of Brits want Baco's. Turn about fair play -- I buy Branston Pickle when I'm over the pond. I hadn't had Baco's in years, so I kept a jar for myself--yummy. Makes salad more fun."
3,good but not great,From my experience Haynes manuals try to cram too many models into too thin of a book. This makes for a handy manual to have around the garage when performing routine maintenance but be prepared to refer to internet sources for more detailed model year specific information. I would have preferred a Bentley manual but couldn't find one for the '75 2002.
4,TEMPTATION,THIS WAS AN AWESOME DRAGON BALL Z VIDEO. VEGETA LOOKED GREAT AND HE KICKED CELL'S BUT. IN THE END IT WAS VEGETA WHO TOLD CELL TO ABSORB ANDROID 18. THIS WAS A GREAT VIDEO AND THE CELL VS. VEGETA BATTLE WAS AMAZING. GET THIS DRAGON BALL Z VIDEO.
5,Nice for shower surround repair,"Like some others, I purchased and used this item to repair a crack in the floor of my 10 year old shower surround. The crack was actually about 5 inches long, but only about an inch of the crack was broken all the way through so that water could leak. I mixed up a small batch, then applied it to the entire length of the crack and about 1 cm. wide. After letting it set and dry for about 18 hours, we started using the shower again. So far the repair has held up great, even after a week of seeing two showers a day. The color is a slight off-white, but it's about as white as you're going to get with an epoxy. After drying, the surface of the epoxy is glass-smooth and very hard, so I have no real worries about dirt or cleaning agents discoloring it."
1,Not for me!,"I seem to be in the minority here, but I think this is gross. I'm thinking that having decided no more meat, maybe I'll skip the ""fake"" meat as well. This one for sure. Now what the heck am I going to do with a case minus one?!?"
3,Good book,This book point out many important topics. Our instructor recommened us to use it and it does help. Only bad part about this book is that it has very few practice questions.
2,Doesn't help,Did not help me at all in my pediatrics class. It is easy and fun to read but it was not in depth enough for my pediatric exams (I used this book for 2 pediatric exams). After reading this book and not getting any results I bought Child Health Nursing by Mary Hogan and that book was a live saver. After reading that book I scored above average on my pediatric final and on the NLN pediatric state test!
5,Very good third season.,have no complaints about this dvd. It played and was delivered on time and well packaged. The season is also good. Has some episodes where it felt like watching a soap opera.
5,The natural heir to the X Files legacy.,"Fringe is leaps and bounds ahead of any other television sci-fi in all departments - writing, acting, pacing, etc. If you love sci-fi and have yet to give Fringe a go, you're missing out."
4,Good as ever,"Series at times gets stranger but it's still the best series on TV. Very character driven, surrounded still with episodes on interest."
1,don't like this season,"I guess the one good thing I can say about season 3 is, now it makes sense why Walter wanted Belly to remove pieces of his brain. I don't like Walternate, and my guess is that he didn't like himself, either. I miss Walter on these alternate episodes, and I hope season 4 will be back to normal. I also miss Olivia.. I don't like Fauxlivia at all.Well at least there is a line Walternate won't cross. But things are just too predictable and boring."
2,Crowded,"So now she has her ex-boyfriend, all the memories and knowledge of her alter-ego and Mr. Spock inside her head? Must be getting a bit crowded in there.Honestly this show is getting a bit silly."
5,Third season different but still terrific!,The series has veered off in new directions but its still as interesting and innovative as ever. Definately worth watching.
5,NOT LOST! Fringe learns Lost lessons.,"The good thing about fringe is.... it's not Lost, it does not lead you somewhere and then let you down... they talk about the other side, and then go there, they show both sides of things as ""real people"" although I would like personally the over there to be a bit more villainous, they do take their time on reveals like is Peter from over there.. yes it took them awhile after the viewers knew it to reveal it to the characters. Same with Alt-Olivia we know she is from over there but it takes awhile to show that to the people that count. The show had lost it's momentum in the second season with the creature episodes but found a home with mythology heavy shows and has kept it up... Good job Adams for not killing fringe like Lost."
4,I was an X Filer. Season 3,Tribute to Twin Peaks was awesome. I felt there were elements of Fringe that took me back to the TP days and this was affirmed. Totally cool!
5,Anticipation,I love how this show keeps you coming back for more. This episode is the first time Peter try's to enter the machine.
3,Okay I'll be nice,"I have to say that this episode is good, which is a nice break during a bad season. I thought Olivia pulled off Bell's voice very well, but I do hope Bell finds another host soon. I'm really not digging the story line this season, but this episode gave me hope that it might get better. I don't know,maybe they need some new writers for fresh ideas."
4,"Interesting premise, but losing its novelty","Similar to what is happening to Supernatural, Fringe has moved away from stand-alone stories to a broader super story. In the case of Supernatural, it's angels and demons, and in this case it's alternate universes. That's all well and good, but it comes at the expense of the mysterious single show stories. Everything now revolves around the central story as if all other fringe events have now disappeared. Overall, it's an okay series, but I find myself a bit disappointed with the larger story."
5,fantastic series,"We watch these on tv, and then order the seasons when they come available. These are great shows. Kind of wierd, and sometimes gross, but always interesting. The best thing is that I can follow the logic. I usually can't when science fiction is involved, but these are pretty easy. If you don't have the whole set, you can get the other seasons pretty cheaply through Amazon. It is well worth your money. You can watch them over and over and never get tired of them. We don't watch much tv because we don't find much to watch. We don't have cable, just our few local channels. So these are great to see several times. Liquorish"
5,The most awesome TV show ever.,"If you don't like this show, you either don't have taste or don't like TV shows. This is the most excitement you'll get from hours and hours of television ever."
5,One of the most unexpected season finale cliffhangers,"Without spoiling, all I have to say is this episode was stunning and heartbreaking on many counts. Peter's use of the machine led to the events depicted in this episode, set 15 years in the future. All characters are affected. It continues the ongoing themes of choice, destiny, fate and hope.Questions are answered. New ones arise. The ending will have fans questioning all summer: ""Where does Fringe go from here?"" At this point, I really don't know, and can't wait for Season Four to find out!"
1,Jumped The Shark,"I enjoyed the past 2 seasons of Fringe. However, the current ""Total Alternate Universe"" theme in EVERY episode this year, is both annoying and confusing.Fringe is on the Fringe of loosing this fan!"
5,"Very helpful information, easy to read book!","This is a very easy to read book, full of lots of easy information to obsorb. This will be very good information and a great resource for me in my new career."
2,Preachy as all heck - okay storyline.,"While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.) The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin."
5,Beautiful music,"We had an old cassette tape given by a friend who said it was ""happy music."" She was right! However, tape has an annoying habit of breaking. Eventually ours did. So one day I looked and found that it was available on CD through Amazon.com. Thank you!"
5,Sin City,"My Husband was very happy wiht the gift, of the DVD Sin City, I perfer shopping at amazon.com, rather then at the store, much more to choose from and no pimply sales boy trying to help me, advising me of all his special DVD'S. shipping is easy and the trip to the mail box is without a car, so gas is also a hugh savings."
5,Sin City: Re-release,"This version is 10 times better than the original DVD, it has many more special features, included scenes previously cut out from before (hence the title's name). You need to buy this DVD if you liked Sin City and were unsatisfied with the first release!!"
1,May be good for die-hard geeks,"I can't believe this movie.The dialogues consist of endless one phrase pre-killing warnings, like ""You just made the greatest error of your life"", ""You will regret it!"" and so on, after which the actor/actress throws a ""meaningful"" dramatic look at the bleeding victim and pull out their big gun/sword/bazooka...The women have of course their own bazookas stuck in their leather G-strings and their hair always has wind in it and they are really really badass.Everyone's voice is low and dramatic and it becomes kind of monotone and makes you want to sleep, especially whith the movie being always so dark.I found it terrible and predictable. But if you like computer games with women fighters you probably will enjoy this."
2,"Looks Good, But Isn't Good","So I saw ""Sin City""; another in a long line of films that look good, but aren't good. Yeah, I know there are sexy women and lots of nudity, but for these types of films a story would be nice. And while I respect Frank Miller as an artist, I am not really a fan of his work. Also, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have done much better in the past. See ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" for what I mean.I used to really respect Rodriguez as a director, but ever since he got caught up in the 3-D craze, he really hasn't made anything that has excited me since ""Spy Kids 2"". I'm referring to ""Spy Kids 3"" and ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"". Even his standard films like ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" have suffered.Rodriguez is currently working on a sequel to ""Sin City"". I can hardly wait (sarcasm)."
1,Wait for the Special Edition!!!!,Do not let the slip covers and giveaways fool you! This is the rushed version of the DVD! In a short time the 2 disk S.E. will be here with more extras than you will know what to do with!
5,An unrivaled mix of animation and reality,"I can say without doubt that normally I do not like animation [cartoons]. I will avoid them [animation] at all cost. They are a stupid waste of time & money!!! -- But then I saw ""Sin City""!!! I also don't waste my time & money on spooky movies, monsters and scary stuff [all stupid]!!! But then I saw ""Sin City""!!!This movie is one for the ages. To its detractors I say ,,, you just don't get it!!! The Directing is ""creative"" and ""magnificent""; the acting ""superb""!!!Frankly this movie, Sin City, reminded me of ""Spawn"", which is another movie for the ages!!! One in a class of its own!!!If more ""animated"" movies were of this caliber ,,, I would be forced to change my opinion of CGI, Blue-Screen, animation [cartoons] etc... WHICH FOR THE MOST PART ALL SUCK!!!-peace - Sin City is in a class of its own - GREAT!!!"
3,Too long,"In Sin City you will get to see violence in such an explicit way, it isn't shocking anymore. After a couple of action sceneswith Mickey Rourke you'll just look at the violence as if it is fun like Tom and Jerry. When you reach that mood the cartoon based movie is definetely nice to watch, especially with so many colourful characters being there. However Sin City shouldhave been at least 30 minutes shorter as Rodriguez needs to use his brilliant trick with the violence for 3 story lines. After the second story line his trick I would have liked to see something else, but this is where the movie let me dow a little. (SARR)"
1,Stingy studio-double-dipping,"You already know that this is going to be the first of about 3 dvd's released for this film. With virtually no special features, the only one of which is a behind-the-scenes featurette which was available for FREE at Best Buy, this is the studio at it's greed point. You know there will be a super-ultimate-limited-for-the-fans-only 10 disc set coming just in time to piss you off because you've already spent money on this craptacular bare-bones disc.Count me out."
1,Review of the DVD...,"When a studio releases a quickie bare bones disc then a special extended edition later it's called ""double dipping"". They expect Sin City fans to shell out once then when the cool edition comes out to shell out again.This practice is becoming increasingly uncool. Tell them you aint gonna play by passing on this disc and picking up the special edition when it comes out later this year.What can you expect on the special edition? Well, if it's anything like the two ""Hellboy"" releases, everything that's on this plus a little bit more.Worth the wait? Up to you."
1,Awsome Movie - Pre-Announed Double Dip DVD,"This is a Great Movie, but the director announced months ago that this movie will be a double dip. A 2 disc SE is coming. Be sure that you wait if you want the extra stuff"
4,pretty good...better than i thought,"When Sin City came out to the theaters I really wanted to see it but I waited, even though friends told me it was good. Well I borrowed it from a friend and finally watched it. Let me say, I was not disappointed. The movie told a interweaving story of three or four characters...and it was very engrossing. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because of all the narration, it was alright but could have delt with a little less of it. The black and white added to the ""old school"" feel and overall it was wonderfully made."
1,First movie I've ever walked out on,This was the first movie that I've ever walked out on. I was fooled in to thinking that this was a great movie. I watched about ten minutes and just left. What I didn't like was just the bad acting and the long drawn out boreing begining. I can get over the cartoonish style as I loved 300 but this was just a horrible movie.
1,nauseous,"A star is far too much for this pathetic movie.I wanted to leave after 5 minutes and then i hoped it would finish( it never did).It was like a butcher's stall; this movie is just about people cutting each other apart. Violence is omnipresent and valorised.The roles are stereotyped: all women are whores in sex-gear, and all men are brutal, pitiless drug-addicts that spend their time killing each other. It's not realistic: Dwight jumped from a building and didn't get hurt.There is no point because the movie is just a massacre so it's not entertaining or interesting.This movie is only a waste of time and money."
5,What a Power Punch,"This movie packs a punch. From the opening you are grabbed by the colors and then the action which never lets up. Mickey Roarke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owens turns in stunning performances. I love the old cars, and how you never show exactly how they made the grapics. Rosario Dawson in black leather looks truly a marvelous creature to feast your eyes on. The Blonde chicks who plays the silent killer is awesome. The preformance by Michael Clark Duncan, Jessica Alba, Brittney Murphy, and Bernicio Del Torro are good, but are quickly forgotten. I've seen this three times and do plan to buy it. ""Yes"" it is pretty gory, is aimed at adults, ""Yes"", it does have hyper violent moments, and ""Yes"" even the good guys with questionable morals become good guys, but none of this detracts from it."
4,Punching Our Buttons,"This is an outstanding film - one of the best in a so-so year for movies.But I totally agree with a reviewer below - ""staged releases"" of DVDs in standard, and then later, ""deluxe"" editions is a blatant attempt to milk the property for every drop of revenue that can be had.Oh, well. The only thing we DVD consumers who love the special features can do it either wait and not take the bait, or take a complete pass. With a movie this important, though, it's awful hard to hold back..."
5,Like Stepping Right Into the Graphic Novel,"All I can say is, Wow. I went into the film knowing that it been a graphic novel but not reading them. I was amazed at the photography and editing. The way everything in a shot is black and white except for Clive Owens' red sneakers. All the little things really do make a difference, in the feel and look of the film. The acting is great, let me tell you you'll never look at Elijah Wood the same way. I've now just picked up Frank's book and can really appreciate his artwork in image and storytelling even more than if I hadn't seen the film."
5,Outstanding Adaptation,"This film is simply the best adaptation of a graphic novel in existence. The ""cool"" visuals and over-the-top action sequences are complemented by classic noir themes and (especially during the ""That Yellow Bastard"" segment) subtle and intelligent symbolism. The characters are processed and amped-up representations of their film noir archetypes, and the actors play their parts perfectly. Mickey Rourke's performance is undoubtedly the highlight, much to my surprise. The DVD is lacking in aspects such as special features, and I had trouble playing it in a certain DVD player of mine, but that might have been the fault of the (rather old) player. It worked fine in all other players I've tried, so this shouldn't be a deterrent from buying it. This is a great film and well worth owning for repeated viewings. Due to the violence subject matter, it won't be for everyone, though. Keep the kids away."
2,wweak,"The film was disappointing in every way. Pathetic , weak, unrealistic, garbage. I knew better and didn't finish. Good luck with this one."
2,Ain't all that.,"If you're into black and white comic strip stuff with gruesomeness and cute techy show-offs, this one's for you."
2,Not worth seeing,"The photography in this movie is amazing and very true to comic books. However, not having read these comics, the plot didn't make sense. My husband had the same reaction. I could appreciate the gratuitous nudity, but the continuous violence was a turn off. Overall, I wish I'd stuck with just watching the trailer."
2,"Without care, ""scholarship"" becomes corruption","This book is an affront to the ideals central to the Qabala. It diverges greatly from the principal teachings of this system, most notably the Sepher ha-Gilgulim and the Sepher ha-Bahir. It has taken some of the ideas introduced by the Golden Dawn, a system which, I might add, does take proper responsibility for the material it is propagating, and mutates it into something convenient and simple. The Qabala is about disciplined study, not dime-a-dozen charlatanry"
5,"OK at first, better with age","Different than their first album, and has a more upbeat sound of it's own. It's been in the CD changer for a couple weeks now, but took time to grow on me."
2,Absolutely Disappointing,"I have no problem with a group experimenting, being creative, or going in a different direction...but this CD is completely void of anything memorable.Silly, unfunny, incoherent, jumbled, uncreative...all would be words to describe this CD. I loved the first two releases from them, but it seems their creative energy has turned into some kind of mumbled, electronica pop with no soul.Critics love the single ""We Used To Be Friends"" and that should tell you something right there.Trendy hipsters might elevate this release to classic status because of their lack of objectivity and general willingness to go along with whatever's popular and cool - but anyone looking for a memorable, long lasting, quality CD should look elsewhere.I'm sorry but this CD garbage, truly disappointing considering how promising and good their first two releases were."
3,Welcome to the Mediocre House,"I was expecting more of 13 tales from urban bohemia, and that is not what this album is. Actually, its more of a dance album than a rock n roll album. 13 tales is one of my favorite albums of all time because of the obvious influences of some of my favorite old singers/songwriters (Mick Jagger, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Lou Reed), but with monkey house, they clearly did not have the same influences or even the same creative force which made 13 tales so memorable and varied. Basically, you can tell that the guy who produced Duran Duran albums had a large say in the production of this album and I find that sad. I do really like Plan A, though, and I listen to it about 10 times in a row and sing along then take the album off. I would not recomend this album unless you want some 80s sounding synth-pop to dance around to. But if you don't have 13 tales, get it quick."
2,Directionless Dandy's,"I liked 'Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia' and alot of their earlier stuff, but I must say I'm a little disappointed with this new electronic direction they're taking. Other than one or two songs that I like, 'Welcome to the Monkey House' seems to combine futuristic-type beats alongside guitars, perhaps a sign of a band wanting to experiment a bit (and perhaps a sign of the recent electroclash trend) Personally I like the Dandy's which played high-energy rock and with swagger. Who knows, maybe this CD will grow on me, but as of right now, thumbs-down."
1,Just Sad...,"I've really liked the Warhols, and listened to every recording faithfully since their first. This album is unlike their others, but is that, in itself, a good thing? Some people seem to want to give them points for ""doing it differently"", as if that in itself were of value. Well, to this listener, the only thing that matters is whether it actually sounds good sonically and lyrically, and whether it actually moves me at all. To me, all three questions are answered with a resounding ""No"". This recording does nothing for me except make me turn away from this band, and perhaps wax nostalgic for the time when they constructed and played music that really made me feel something, songs like Genius or Morpheus or Big Indian. Am I living in the past?Perhaps I can't see the greatness of this record, in the way that I can't seem to ever get into the majority of Radioheads' music? I guess I just don't ""get it"". And that's ok..."
4,Great family movie!,This movie was a really a nice surprise! Bindi Irwin did a great job and all the characters are played very well. My five and two year old daughters LOVE this movie and watch it over and over. I think I like this free willy movie the best out of the whole series.
3,ok,I love this because my dog (lab) can't destroy it. Its nice to hide the treats in it. I do not like the outside ridges because they are super messy to load up and clean. My dog was not really into licking the stuffing out so it was just rolling around making a mess. We basically just use it as a heavy duty ball now and sometimes hide treats in the middle part
2,"Great idea, just not durable enough for my power-chewers","My two border collies need creative toys to play with while I am away at work, so I've tried lots of things. This ball looked promising, and it worked great.... for one day. Then it was torn in half, rendering it useless. I wish it was tougher , but if your pooches aren't crazy with their chewing, this could be a great toy for them."
3,Might work better for someone else!,"The product is what it claims to be. Sturdy, with places for peanut butter, and a place for treats. One of our dogs will take the time to work out the treats, which is what we wanted. She likes to carry it around and chew on it. The part that really doesn't work for us is the cracks for the peanut butter. They get dirty nasty. And she won't/can't lick them completely clean. It does go in the dishwasher and come out nice, but our dog likes to pick this up and drop it over and over. We will keep it for her to play, but no peanut butter."
2,Peanut butter on the outside works,My smaller terrier type dog likes it ifI put peanut butter on the outside. Ican do that with an old bone. Cleaningis a real hassle. Not filling with mucnthat is fun.
4,great busy toy,"I bought the Large size for two of my dog's friends. She is 60 lbs, her friends are too. I bought the large but was surprised to see how big it was. The one my dog has must be a medium which is way more appropriate for her size. The large is almost too big for her to carry. I can't even imagine what the XL would be like.Over all it is a great toy, very durable for the hard chompers."
2,Nope,"Our pup did not like this.The size of the opening makes it difficult to find the 'perfect' treat or food. Available options were either way too small (regular food) or too big (hard bones).We tried breaking up a bunch of bones, but in the end it was too much trouble.Bummer, because we usually like this brand a lot."
4,A Little Dynamo,"I now have no excuse not to take pictures. The Epson Picture Mate is easy to use and the finished product is as good as or better than any photo lab. The one complaint that I hear and read about is the lack of a monitor. Since I review most of my pictures in the camera's monitor (Nikon coolpix 995) or enhance them with my computer, I hardly miss the monitor at all. If it prints too slowly for anyone, I suggest that you press the print button and go about your business. When you return, you wil have some of the finest quality (use the epson paper) longest lasting prints that you can obtain anywhere."
1,Not worth the time or money,"This picturemate has been a total disaster. After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow. Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again. Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image, but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!"
5,"So far, so good","I have only had the printer for a week. However, I have printed off approx. 20 pics and they look great. The built in LCD is very easy as it includes a wizard to walk you through steps to print as soon as you put in your card."
1,Major Problems: Won't work with both of my computers,"It's a neat little printer. It did print out several packs of pictures before developing a problem with printing at all. No longer ""recognized"" by my laptop, and this after uninstalling, downloading their latest drivers, reinstalling (3x so far) and still no luck. Called their nice tech support who sent out a ""new"" (refurbished) machine and it, too, is not 'recognized' and cannot print from either my desktop or laptop. I'm 'calling it a day' with this frustrating little gem. I'm looking for a good replacement."
2,Good prints for 48 hours then Black fades,Ok I bought this for the supposedly long life of the ink. Then my dream were shattered by all the disclaimers. I have to live in a glass bubble to get those results.Then I noticed that the black when first printed looks absulotely great compared to my Canon 5000 but after 48 hours the black faded? I'm using Epson ink? Whats up Epson you optimize your ink for store sales?Now I know why there are so many lawsuits to you over yoru claims.Very Disatisfied!
4,Works as advertised,"My last receiver was a Yamaha DSP A1 and that was quite some time ago. I just recently got this one and the sound that it reproduces is excellent. I like the ability to calibrate the output to the speakers based on location of the listener. That is a really useful feature. What I didn't like is its video processing capability. It isn't that great, but I just wanted the receiver for the sound so I am OK with that."
3,Sound is good but...,"I would have given this unit a 4.5 because it sound is powerful and has plenty of plugins for all of your components. The plugins aren't the easy wiring kind, but the biggest drawback is the manual is very difficult to follow and if you have to call the tech support expect to wait a long time to talk to someone. Once you do get someone, you have a 50/50 chance of getting someone that won't want to rush you off the phone. I had to call twice is how I came up with a 50/50 chance. It is a powerful receiver. But unless you are very good at setting up this equiptment, (I thought I was) you should get a surround sound in a box. it's already together, just plug and play."
1,HUM in power supply,"I've loved this Reciever, till about a month ago a low 60hz HUM appeared. It's constant on all inputs (when signal is availble on digitals) and is the same level regardless of volume. I eliminated the ground loop possibility. It's just under 2 yrs. old. I've replaced it with a Denon. I've yet to hear back from Onkyo on support, but will probably cost me shipping and take many weeks for repair. Anyone interested in a refubished unit about 2 months from now?I expected better."
4,Fully HDMI,"I really love the sound this thing puts out, and I like having all of my video and audio going through one component. My only trouble is that I bought the 705 thinking that I could go from coax input to HDMI input wqhen I finally sprung for the HD cable box. No such luck. The one thing I forgot to check was the coax input on the 705. There isn't one - my bad.The receiver is great, and I'll finally spring for the HD box, but the instructions for programming the remote are bad. It took about 35 minutes for me to get everything working properly. Seems they left out a step or two in the instructions."
1,Huuuum noise,"I have a TX-SR705 with the terrible HUMMM problem. The noise started 2 weeks ago, about a year after I bought it. I hear a low level hum in all speakers on all channels (DVD, CBL, AUX, GAME, etc.). Seens to be a huge sistemic problem with +/- 1 year of operation in a lot of units."
2,Replacement order dvd was found to be defective; Just like first one!!,This was the second dvd that was replaced due to the first dvd being defective and upon further investigation of this 2nd dvd replacement order - I found it to be a replicated/burned dvd; which will not always play well on all dvd players! Beware of purchasing this dvd - make sure it is an original !! Very bad customer service experience!!
1,Useless,"Tried to use it with different size cans and was unable to adjust it so it could fit and start opening the but was unable to do it, other people tried too. I would give this product NO stars. I bougth it because I've had other Hamilton Beach products and they've been OK."
2,Not for me.,I had one of thse and it failed. I got another and it did not last long either so I bought this third one that I have trouble using so I bought a crank one which works better.
1,Hamilton Beech 76500 cordless can opener,"I purchased this because of the Hamilton Beech name as a matter of fact I ordered two because they were so cheap. JUNK,JUNK. My first one could only open 3 lg cans before it had to be recharged, then it broke. The second one operates the same about 3 lg cans then recharge. I would probably never buy another Hamilton Beech product....."
1,couldn't get it to pierce the can,"This is a good concept, but, I could not get it to even line up to pierce the top of the can. It would run fine without a can in it. What's the point? Ended up purchasing a counter top model for $12.00 at a local vendor."
2,Hands Free Can Opener,"It works ok for the price, but is a little difficult for me to use. It takes a little ""pressure"" to push the blade piece down onto the can and is difficult for those with bone/joint/muscle issues-disabilities. I also did not realize that the can opens from the top, not smoothly from below the lids. So at times, I have had ""splash-overs"" from the liquid on the can. Would only recommend it for those who want a ""hands free"", but do not have any medical issues with use of hands/wrist. This item is definitely not for the ""physically impaired""!"
5,Only can opener I use,"I've used this opener for over 3 years and it is the only one I use. I have arthritis in my hands and it certainly helps. Many, many uses before having to plug it in to recharge. I have given it as a gift many times. Can't go wrong with this item!"
4,Not good for arthritic person,I have arthritis. It is too difficult for me to press the handle down. Device works well.
3,hard to get started,My wife has to get me to get this thing goingf every time as she can't get it to start on the can
1,Hamilton Beach 76500 walk'cut cordless can opener,"If I could, I could rate this ""no"" stars. I thought that the persons who wrote that this product was useless must not have followed the directions. But after I received mine, I will agree with them. I could not get it to work. I had other people try it and they were not able to get it to work. I bought two, so I returned the one I had not opened. I tried everything according to the directions. Nothing worked. I know the battery was charged because I could turn it on when it was not on the can. I wasted good money on something that was useless."
2,Disposable Can Opener,This must be considered a disposable item. It did not even last a year before it broke. I like to buy items and keep them forever so I would rather pay more and have it last at least 5 years so I am not wasting time at the checkout.
4,Great can opener,"Love this can opener, its small compact and also very handy! The battery seems to last as well I bought this about a month ago and it still hasnt had to be recharged!"
2,Not fun!!,"I bought this item because the reviews said it was fun, and did a good job. I find it very difficult to puncture a can and get it started running. It seems that the design makes the leverage all wrong. Then when I do get it to start, it often cuts out. I am not really happy with it and expect I will have to find another can opener to get the job done."
3,Cute! Broke after 3 months. . .,"Cutest little can opener you ever saw! Worked great, easy to use, kept a charge very well. Only thing wrong with it is it broke (blade jammed inside the unit) after only 3 months. I'd love to have another one, but don't think I'll throw money after it. It was nice while it lasted!"
3,"Nice, but a little hard to use","I had a rechargeable can opener for a number of years and loved it. Black and Decker no longer make the one I had. When my old one died, I looked for another, and this was the only option I found. It takes up little space, which is good. However, It is hard to get the can opener to attach to the can. Sometimes, I just can't get it on the can at all. I have some arthritis in my fingers, which is why I wanted an electric can opener. This falls a little short of what I was hoping for."
1,It broke within 60 days!,The can opener is not very practical. It requires charge often and broke within 60 days with little use. It was sort of an interesting shape requiring an interesting hold to use; possibly leading to cuts. I would not recommend this product. Stick with a standard plug and use can opener if you ask me.
2,Disappointed,This device does open cans but it is difficult to position to get it started. It was purchased to replace a 25 year old opener that was easy to use one handed and required no strength to make it work. This one requires that you are able to push hard with your thumb (which I cannot do due to joint problems) in order to operate. If you ave 2 good hands it is fine. I need something else. Keeping this and my husband uses it.
2,Get something that will last - not this,"I have very limited use of my entire left arm and hand and carpal tunnel in the other hand. I wanted a can opener that was easy to use and that I didn't have to hold onto. After practicing on three cans, I found it very easy to use. We are still in our first charge after a month and five people using it all the time.However, after 6 months, it will no longer hold a charge. It will not cut cans anymore. I'm guessing the plastic parts were unable to hold up with regular family use."
3,Nifty kitchen gadget but requires thumb strength,"I bought this can opener for my 84-year old dad. I tried it out myself and thought, ""Nifty, he should like this!"". I showed my dad how to use it last night and we spent a half hour trying all different hand positions to find one where he could press the thin actuator lever down without any success. I think I will keep this for myself and buy him one that sits on the counter so he can push his whole weight down on its lever. I would not recommend this gadget for an older adult."
5,Works like a charm!!!,I bought this for my wife because she wanted something that was easy to use. Worked like a charm right out of the box. Used almost daily
3,It's Okay...,"Works okay, once you have it attached to the can. Since I don't use a can opener very often, I use my old manual one unless I am opening a very large can."
1,URELIABLE,"I wasted alot of money on various test strips and blood collection devices -as well as time talking to customer support. If you want an accurate reading on your cholestorol, DON'T use this."
1,Wish I had not bought this DVD,"Despite our love for W&G DVD's (such as Wrongful Trousers...), this was a HUGE disappointment for our 7 and 5-yo children. Dry humor, no action, hard to follow...just not fun. The entire DVD is nothing but a documentary format in which cute animals drone on and on, which after any of the W&G episodes, is just plain b-o-r-i-n-g. While we loved the W&G DVD game, this was a mistake."
4,The secret life of clay?,"I haven't got the exact product listed, but all indications are that this product includes what is available in Australia as ""Creature Comforts Episodes 1-6"" AND ""Creature Comforts Episodes 7-13"". Which is to say, for Australians, Season One you may already have got from the ABC in 2 DVDs, and Season Two is not here as of mid-2007.Season One Episodes are:The CircusThe GardenPets at the VetsThe SeaWorking AnimalsFeeding TimeThe BeachIs Anyone Out There?The Pet ShopCats or Dogs?What's It All About?Being a BirdMerry ChristmasI found the characters adorable and the special features information fascinating. Not laugh-out-loud hilarious all the time, but more deep and sensitive and wise than you'd ever expect a clay snail or a seagull to be."
4,SheeBee,I loved this DVD!! Very British comedy - no laugh out loud moments...just lots of chuckles. I enjoyed it very much.
5,Voice supremacy,"The Killers voice is never better than on these tracks. The pitches, snarls and growls are fantastic. Listen carefully to Don't Be Cruel. Jerry Lee runs circles around Elvis ... and Elvis is of course GOOD!Some people have a grievance about the strings. Don't worry, the strings fits like a glove to this music. It's magic. I toured with Linda Gail filming but never got to meet her brother, as much as I ever wanted to press the hand of the best voice I have ever heard ... and he shines on this record."
1,It broke after 2 hrs,The mouse broke in 2 hrs of usage. The computer shows it as unknown device after two hours of gaming. I got a G5 which is much better.
5,Best Gaming Mouse tever,"I bought this mouse because I used it once at a local gaming store and it was very nice and accurate. I recently had a Logitech MX518 which was a very nice gaming mouse and just falls short in my opinion to this Razer DeathAdder. The name pretty much describes this mouse. I am playing Call of Duty World at War, and the shooting is so accurate I hardly miss. I have a logitech gaming mouse and a Razer Barracuda headset and they all light up the exact same blue, it looks pretty cool. Buy this mouse for sure!"
5,yay,i would highly recommend this mouse. its ecellent for gaming and for just surfing the web. my husband (in IT)liked it so much he bought himself one.
2,poor quality,"Poster is poor quality. If you touch it with damp fingers, it takes the color off the photo and leaves a reddish mark."
2,Inconsistency Dooms Stepfather 3,"A poor script as well as an over use of blood hamper what little hope given to this film from Robert Wrightman's 50/50 performance. The film suffers from inconsistency: meaning that the good parts, like the beginning, are good and do get your hopes up, but you will only have them crushed moments later bad some bad blood effects or unfitting dialouge. It had the potential, and Wrightman gave a decent attempt at the stepfather character, but the supporting cast and writing simply aren't up to the task."
2,the 900 days;,"Having made 2 trips toSt. Petersburg in the past 3 years, both guides highly recommended this book. It is incredibly well written, both the background leading up to the atack as well as the hardships over the next 2+ years. The fortitude and heroism portrayed give a much better understanding of the Russian people and what they endured."
5,the definitive work on the siege of leningrad,"i've read a few works on the Leningrad siege but this one has been the best so far. i gnerally read professional works of history by historians which is what this book definately is. at the same time it reads almost like a novel in terms of development of characters, from stalin to the every day citizens trying to survive under unimaginable conditions. i would definately recommend this book for those wishing to learn about one of the most horrific episides of WWII"
2,"Fair, but lotsa mistakes","I've long had a crush on Eleanor Powell, and I have the copies of all of her movies and I know well the author of the best biography of this fabulous dancing star. But this soundtrack is seriously flawed and I cannot find out who makes it. Track 2 (""Feelin'"") is sung not by that leggy Powell, but by June Knight and Robert Taylor. All other songs credited to Eleanor Powell were actually sung by Majorie Lane. Ms. Powell lip-synched songs in all movies she starred in from 1935 on. She sang a couple of short ditties before 1935. After track 15 of the 1940 movie, the finale -- a reprise of the ""I've got my eyes on you"" song -- is completely omitted. Audio quality is not good. This is a sloppy production. Someone is degrading the reputation of one of the best musicals ever made and it's insulting to the fine cast and crew, in particular to Fred Astaire, George Murphy and that fabulous and divine creature with the best legs God ever put on a woman."
3,Goten and Trunks dominate,"The first episode and a half weren't that exciting. Kids ""fight"" in the junior division and it's really not that exciting until the finals: Goten VS Trunks. It's a great fight between the two and definitely worth seeing. The menu is animated and has lots of options."
3,Galactic empire novel.,The Galactic Empire series was written after the Foundation series as a prequel. This particular novel is typical Asimov and does not really stand out more than any others in either series
3,ascetically pleasing - NO privacy,"BE WARNED - ZERO privacy! It's completely see through. It does add a bit of depth or texture to the window, so I gave it 3 stars for that. I don't care about the privacy in the area I have it, so it's not an issue here. This window 'dressing' is one step above having nothing. It suits my purpose and I did know that there would be ZERO privacy, LOL - i'm not upset, just giving you the heads up :-)"
1,Doesn't fit regular sized tubes of toothpaste,It simply doesn't support regular sized tubes of toothpaste because the device isn't wide enough. Don't buy it unless you have only narrow tubes.
3,Heavy Canon logo,"The ""Canon Powershot"" logo, on the open and closing flap of the case, is heavy/ bulky."
3,Nice product,Provide good protection to the camera. Only the price is a little high. I think 3-4 would be OK.
4,Finally,Canon Finally think in all the customers... I have a Powershot A630 and it's like a glove for the camera.. but just have enought space for 3 extra bateries (and you need 4...).
4,Nice Little Case,Nice compact case. Good padding to protect camera. Pocket will fit 4 batteries but they can fall out. Overall a good product for the camera.
4,Snug fit,"This turned out not be the best case for my needs, so I purchased something else. However, my Canon Powershot A620 fit in there just fine and so did the batteries."
2,not good enough,"You can put only your digital cam, not enough space for your reserve batteries.. After 2 months the writing ""cannon powershot"" in front of the case will be ereased.."
2,Nice if you need a really small case,"There's very little room here for anything other than your camera, so if you need to carry anything else, go for something better (Samsonite makes some decent, inexpensive cases with multiple zip pockets).The extra pouch on this thing doesn't have any closing mechanism (zipper or velcro), so when you take out the camera, anything else you're carrying (batteries, etc.) will rattle around loose and fall out if you're not careful. Can't tell you how many times I've dropped my extra batteries.Also, there's no carry strap, which most other camera cases (even small ones in this price range) come with."
1,Not compatible with Canon A630,"I got this case along with A630 since the product description mentioned that it is compatible with the A630. However, this case is just too small and the camera does not fit into the case. This product is not compatible with the A630."
4,Great Case,"Fits camera real well. Storage compartment could be a little larger, but the price can't be beat."
4,side kick for a A510 or A520,"If you have a A510 or A520 & you hate carrying it in your hand, rather have your hands free, this is great. One draw back though, its a belt loop not a swivel, I'm very active at work or off so I prefer to have a swivel on it. Last, its a must have for now till something better comes out, it protects your camera."
4,Camera Carrying Case for Canon A550,The front storage pocket is just big enough to carry a couple of extra AA batteries. The camera fits snugly inside but is easy to remove for use.
4,Neat little case!,"Fits my camera nicely. Small enough to carry camera within case in my purse. Has small pocket on front for extra digital card or batteries. Other features I like: It's a soft flexible case, has a hole in case for camera cord to go through, and the cost was a good value."
4,A good case,"I bought this for a Canon A550 as a basic protection case. It fits that bill perfectly, but it could be padded a little better, and I would like to see a ring or two on the case to attach a carry cord or strap. The front pocket under the flap is just the right size for a second set of batteries, or (as I use it) for the USB cord."
5,Very nice ...,Case fits my Canon A540 digital camera very well. Nice price. Nice quality. A good buy.
4,Charlie Trotter's Desserts,"This is a great book to draw inspiration from , but the recipes are not always accurate. I have enjoyed the book for over a year. The pictures alone are worth the price. The book may be better suited for those who are professionals and not the home cook."
1,FORGET IT!,"I was so excited about this book, and I ended up returning it. I think there was only one recipe that I wanted to make. This book is way too complicated - and I use Pro Pastry Chef all the time! The ingredients alone... sheesh! Buy a Rose Levy Berenbaum book instead."
1,Smaller Than Previous Filter,"Until the cold/dry weather gets here I won't be able to make sure this unit functions properly. This filter is smaller than the filters I've ordered in the past 5 years from another supplier by over 1"". This concerns me as it may not work properly.I will say that the vendor has offered to accept a return on the filter, however, at my expense. I will probably go back to ordering from my previous supplier next year."
3,Pre-Fame Cindy Lauper,My favorites were track 1 & 7. Remember them when I was a teenager in Puerto Rico. Wish I could find the lp. Thanks for the memories
3,"You're Not Sick, You Just Miss Ethel!","I recommend finding the Merman-Decca release of 12 Songs from Call Me Madam, whereupon you can hear the greatest Berlin interpreter, Merman, singing the songs she made famous on the Broadway stage. However, having the original orchestrations is some consolation for the substandard, though competent, Daly renditions."
3,Eyebrows changed shape!,"I have been taking the vitamins for a bit over 1 month now. My hair has stayed the same but on a random day I noticed that my eyebrows changed a bit. My eyebrows sorta grew or darkend a bit, I am not sure which but the shape I usually get with the help of a brow pencil is kinda natural now. I am still waiting for results on my hiar. I think my skin has always been good so am not certain if the pills have any affect."
1,very dangerous,I took natures bounty hair skin and nails for two years it worked great until I noticed a huge growth on my skin and it was very infected it was not cancerous I went to the doctor and he send me to a surgeon and five different doctors had told me that it was a chemical in the vitamin to preserve it that caused the growth I had surgery. a year later I tried it one more time just to make sure after two months I had the same growth and infection this time I went to a specialist and he told me the same thing that it was from this vitamin. This vitamin works fast but it is very dangerous over the counter vitamin. If it is not prescribed by your doctor don't take it
4,COMFORTABLE but sometimes slips off your feet while sleeping,"Bought these for my wife and here are some of the comments she's made:Pros:Very comfortable super soft plush material and keeps your feet warm.The inside of the sock has remained soft after about a year of use and washing in the machine, and my wife still uses her first pair.Cons:Have a tendency to slip off your feet while sleeping and may end up down at the bottom of your bed under the covers.The bottom will eventually get hard on the outside from walking on carpet and where you step down on it. She hasn't had any issue with slipping because she walks almost strictly on carpet.A little bit pricey for one pair of socks BUT they will last a long time before you ever need a replacement.Overall she highly recommends the socks to anyone looking for a soft, durable pair of socks even at the slightly high cost."
3,On the small side,Nice construction but a little small - unless you have very dainty hands. I bought the large and it wasn't large enough. It was way too tight.
1,Intech Ti-Cabretta Women's Golf Glove,"I usually wear Footjoy gloves, but thought I would give these a try as so inexpensive. I only wore them 3 times and had a large whole in the palm. Footjoy are far better you can wash, bleach and they last a long time"
3,See the Movie,"If you've seen the movie, skip this book purchase, unless you can find it in the library. I thought, mistakenly, that the novel would add even the tiniest bit of detail, information, or insight that the movie didn't as most movies are cut up versions of novels. This book was the script to a T. As a matter of fact I suspect the actors read from this book while in front of the camera. There is nothing new to be gained here. I'm giving my copy away to someone who hasn't seen the movie. That being said, I actually enjoyed the movie/script. It was funny, thoughtful, and the characters were likeable. I also like to read books that tackle religious beliefs and sexuality. Unlike a lot of gay films out there Latter Days ends on a high note."
2,"OK, but ...","It's not bad, but it certainly doesn't merit the enthusiasm shown by some reviewers. It's basically a conventional romance plot, with characters whose motivations are completely unbelievable (it's never explained why either of these guys has the slightest interest in the other except that ""they just fell in love"" and are drippingly hottalicious). If this were a heterosexual romance it would be completely unremarkable and hardly anyone would pay attention to it. I fail to understand how changing one character's sex makes anything special out of what would otherwise be a tired potboiler. People should demand something more interesting, and more inventive, from fiction."
5,Dragon Tales Original Television Soundtrack,"It's about time that a cd for children is made in the style that adults could enjoy as well. The music is hip-hopping, hip swinging & fingers snapping rockin tunes. The music makes you want to get up and dance!!!!!"
2,School books,This book convinced me I will never buy a book for school again. I pay $80 for a book and never open it.If you go to class you never need a book.
4,Solar Radiation and Global Warming,Comprehensive but not conclusive. Doesn't the sun (solar cycles & CME's -- coronal mass ejections) impact global weather patterns (warming & cooling cycles) much more than manmade pollution? And doesn't geothermal activity (underwater volcanic magma releases) affect the melting of the polar ice caps more than atmospheric temperature? I thought 'A Crude Awakening' contained more relevant data regarding civilization's peril.'Solar Rain' and 'Brotherhood of the Sun' are also worth investigating.
4,Non-biased and Balanced???,"Remove the anti-conservative, anti-business sentiment that runs throughout the book and it would be non-biased and balanced. He presents a good argument for needed change, but tends to rant a bit. For the record, I know many liberals who are denying climate change - it's not limited to conservatives.I also saw today where Al Gore and his gang drove 5 cars 500 yards from his hotel to the location where he premiered his movie. What a bunch of great environmentalist hypocrits."
5,global warming for dummies...,Tim Flannery is able to break down the science that goes way over my head and present it in a way that should be able to make anyone understand the clear and present danger that is going on around us...if you really want to understand why scientists are so alarmed without being buried in scientific formulas and data..this is the book to read...read this book then watch Al Gores documentary and I think you'll have a grasp on global warming..I know I do...Mr Flannery is still optimistic that we can change our ways and save ourselves and for that I am grateful thought the tipping point might already be upon us.
2,Disappointed,"I bought the book on the basis it would be an objective and well structured argument explaining how scientists had negated natural influences on climate change - Milankovich cycles, solar activity and plate tectonics - and isolated the anthropogenic influences.However, I discovered the book is written in a mildly hysterical tone common to environmental activists. If you want to read a scientific account of climate change and how human activity is affecting the climate, read the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report."
3,Not the same,These sneakers are OK....don't know if these are original or knock offs...fit is not the same as the Keds I remember!
3,Buyer Beware!,"I purchased a white pair of Keds tennis shoes recently. When they arrived, they looked wonderful and fit like a glove...I just loved them! After a week or so, they needed washed, so I put them in the washing machine with a load of whites and used cold water and a name brand laundry detergent. Imagine my surprise when I removed them from the washer to air dry, and discovered they were now a light blue color! Evidently the dark, royal blue foot liner 'bleeds'. It looks like I have a blue pair of Keds tennis shoes now..."
5,Sneakers,"These shoes were just as I expected. They do seem to run about a half size small, though. They do seem well made. Thanks!"
2,Wrong color,"They sent the wrong color LEDs, I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked."
5,"Hard to find size , found",Wife had liiked for these particular sneakers for months. the 4.5 size was imposible to find in stores. We will increase our purchases on the internet and especially at Amezon in the future
4,Comfy easy canvas shoes,The quality doesn't look as good as I hoped - you can see the glue and a space where the base is attached. I bought these looking for something that might hold up a little better than the cheaper canvas shoes I usually buy at Target - hopefully they will last a little longer otherwise they may not be worth the price. On the other hand they fit just right and are very soft and comfy on my feet. I like the color and the lining and stitching look pretty good.
5,Great casual shoes!,"Sure, Keds aren't made like they were back in the day, but for the price you really can't complain. I got these to wear casually since I didn't want to shell out double the amount for similar shoes, and I love them! There's no arch support, but that's nothing some insoles can't solve. After a few months of wear [even to dances and the gym], my Keds still look pretty new. However, beware people with wider feet! These shoes are a but narrow in the toe area."
2,All right if you're slumming it,"Eh. I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap, but I should have paid more attention to the reviews. The quality is way low with these shoes. They're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they're packed in sardines. (And I have really small feet - I'm a women's 5.5) Now that I see them on my feet, they don't even look that cute. Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem: androgynous, passably okay sneakers that aren't good for running or walking for long periods of time. If you pay 20 bucks for them, you will receive a pair of shoes that are reasonably comfortable for 20 bucks (read: not very comfortable at all) and your footwear will be boring, un-expressive and nondescript. Whatever. Buy a pair if you're slumming it or into gardening or something, but otherwise go get some combat boots or something. These shoes are boring."
2,Keds have become VERY POOR quality..,"Do not buy! The Keds quality has become garbage! Much narrower, cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price!! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart. Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end."
2,Not like Death Note at all,"The acting was terrible and L's character had no opportunity to be the eccentric genius he usually is. It lacked the thrill, suspense, quarks, and story line of the previous two movies and the series itself. But if you love Death Note this movie lets you see two more hours of L..."
2,Yawn...,"While I am glad to see another book about the 5th Marines in Vietnam, the saying goes, if you don't grab a reader within the first few pages...well, they tend to quit reading or throw the dang thing against a wall. As painful as the ordeal was, I actually read it and my opinion remained unchanged to the bitter end. I mean no dishonor to the valiant Marine snipers the author writes about. Every single Marine Sniper who served in Vietnam is a hero to me--not just the infamous Carlos Hathcock. Sadly, the author's writing disability gets in the way of the stories he recounts. To me, 13-Cent Killers pales in comparison to earlier books by some of the Marine Corps finest--other true heroes, including the author himself."
2,Doesn't anyone read these before printing?,"I seldom write reviews, but this book cries out for it. The actual ""13 cent killer"" part is ok, except the author repeats himself throughout the book. But the book constantly puts in the author's personal opinions about the war and the people running it, and he makes potentially libelous remarks ... without citing a shred of evidence to back it up. If he wants to write a political commentary on the Vietnam War, with supporting evidence, a bibliography, etc., more power to him, but defammation unsupported by any cited evidence is inappropriate."
3,Cheap marking guage,"This is an inexpensive marking gauge. It works but if you plan on using it often, I would recommend getting a better one."
3,functional,"Saw marks on the body, the head of the phillips screw is stripped out and the thumbscrew is poorly molded.Pros - works fineCons - poorly made, not really a tool to be proud of"
1,Disappointed,"When I received the gauge the brass slide with the pin was jammed in the slot, i will never buy this junk again"
2,Valuable in All Walks of Life,"Sure, the game is great (dare I use the word ""masterpiece""?)...but does this strategy guide have any greater significance? This question put forth by myself to my inner self and my peers and we began a weekly reading group of the book for the last several years, and ALL of us (save a guy none of us like) found deep, deep meaning within these pages. Is it perfect? Well, no. But it's close. Darn close."
1,waste of money and technology,"looks good, but has only 2Watt power. Way less then build in laptop speakers..complete waste of money and technology, but looks good though."
5,Qigong,I've been practicing for only three days and I can feel the difference. My metabolism is working better and when I am practicing I can feel the Chi in my hands is a unique experience and the instructor is great!.
4,Good house album,"This is a good album of house music. I'd say most of it is more hard house; it also reflects a disco influence. The beats are big and the grooves are good. (It's a little like Mills meets Daft Punk.) The album is mostly pure ""instrumental"" - some tracks contain brief sampling or female vocal accompanyment. The tracks are not mixed, which I generally prefer - you don't get to hear his mixing, but I think the tracks just sound better this way (except for things like Jeff Mills Live at the Liquid Room). If you're into house, this is worth getting."
5,Awesome!,"This was an awesome CD! Every song was a hit! This is a must have for Beatle fans everywhere! So in honor of John Lennon, buy this CD. Cheers!"
5,It blew away everything that came before.,"The most important album in history, and while it might not be The Beatles best (Abbey Road or Revolver), that says more about the greatness of the group than the weaknesses (if any) of the album."
5,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,All in perfect conditions. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is one of the best lp of the history...Thanks for all and best regards
3,"Pretentious, self-indulgent dreck","Sgt. Pepper may be the most ""important"" rock album of all time. It may be the most influential. But it's far from the best. In fact, it's among the Beatles' *worst* albums, substituting pretentiousness for playfulness and creating the sort of pseudo-profundity which has impressed a generation of high school seniors."
3,A Historical Document ... And Overrated,"As history, Sgt. Pepper merits 5 stars. As pure music, I don't agree it's as important. The songs are silly (""Lovely Rita"", ""Sgt. Pepper"") or hopelessly retro (""When I'm 64"", ""Mr. Kite"") and only occasionally deep (""A Day in the Life""). Granted, it got people think differently about how to make albums. But the punk revolution reversed most of the so-called advancements (and brought back 50's style production). The album is not that much fun to listen to. I'd argue the White Album is a better Sgt. Pepper because its songs are so much better."
2,Observations,"Just a few observations on the album and the reviews.On the album: The music alone simply cannot account for the popularity of this release. It isn't that consistently good. I've noticed that everyone who says it's great tends to overlook its obvious flaws (Within You, Without You anyone?) The popularity of this record has more to do with its release being at a memorable time (the war, summer of love, psychedelia, etc.) than the music. Nostalia sells.Finally, sorry, it's not a fact that everyone loves the Beatles. And yes, it is up for debate regarding the appeal of their music. 2 stars"
5,The first and best and concept album of all time,This is the most influential album by the most influential band of the century. It is a must have.
1,Dr. Pepper is better,"I just bought this CD and I dont' see what all the hype is about. My teacher always talks about the Beatles but they have no lyrical skills, my cousin Rodney is a better song writer than these clowns. I think they should remix these songs with 50 Cent or Snoop, then they'd really get some fans behind them."
1,Yuck,"Sounds worn and dated. Sounded good maybe when you were on drugs in the sixties but now, it's drek."
5,"Dear Music Fan From Under My Bed,",You are a dumb uncultured cynic for giving this one star. It is obvious to everyone (except you) that this is creative and original music. Go and listen to your Madonna and Culture Club CD's!
2,Be Honest About It,"With all due respect to nostalgia, if one is honest about it there are two (yes, two!) good songs on this album: Sgt. Pepper and A Day In the Life.Given the artist and the time that's lapsed, this piece has become bigger than life, and it's really unwarranted. There is a try at psychedelia with Lucy, but it's really only the title that invokes anything psychedlic, and the rest of the album is just filled with average offerings: Mr. Kite, Fixing A Hole, Getting Better, Help From My Friends...zzz. We also have to suffer through George's Within You, Without You.Look, the cover art is neat, but don't confuse it with the music. 2-stars."
2,For the Archives,"There is some history that is still relevant today and there is other that should be recognized as influential in its time, then filed away. I own this on vinyl and have framed both the cover and the record as decoration. I never saw a need to replace it on CD, for the simple reason that songs like ""When I'm 64"" and ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" are badly dated, not really standing the test of time. On the other hand, another 1967 release, ""Are You Experienced"" by Jimi Hendrix, is still challenging musicians today. This cover is also on the wall, but the CD is in the player. Big difference. 2-stars at best for Pepper."
1,car crash victims don't sing and play the bass,"Hi, my name's Scott, I'm 12 next spring I have been studying all Beatle litterature and theirown sleazy CDs and I have come to find without a single shotgun doubt that PMC was really killed beyond reecognition after the infamous carcrash that took his life on wednesdaymnornnng at 9 o clock.Listen, grandiose naysayers and other friends, you just can't go on pretending he's still the same today as he was buried on high farm in Scotland 'all those years ago'. Get over it 'Fans of the Past Age' - the man is really no more, he is exit, finito, passed on to the merry pastures, he's friggin dead.See why Heather Mills was so upset when she found out she married an imposter.Cheers Bob, here's to ya!Scott"
1,overated,Simply overated! Imagine and Plastic Ono Band are better albums.If you want humor spend your money on a George Carlin CD.
2,Falls Short,"It was disappointing to discover that this CD falls short of all the praise it seems to get in these reviews, but with songs like When I'm 64, Within You Without You, Fixing A Hole, and Benefit of Mr. Kite, I just have to be honest.Some of the other songs are good (A Day in the Life) but one song doesn't save an album. Some Beatle albums are better, like Help, but this is only about a 2-star CD."
2,#1?,"""Rolling Stone poll says #1 album of all time."" Who cares. Rolling Stone isn't much of a definite authority on anything, and the fact that they rank so many Beatle albums in the top 10 shows their embedded British bias.As for Pepper, it hasn't dated well except for its reputed impact on music, which wasn't as big as often supposed. The future of music was already being defined by others, including Jimi Hendrix.The title track is good, and so is A Day in the Life. Each song gets one star. That's it."
4,overa it,"Look it, JL = r.i.p, GH = r.i.p JPM = r.i.p since he was killid beyond recognition in a carcrash in 1966, so that only lives RS.too bad really?"
3,One of the most over-rated rock albums of all time,"It's been called everything from the Greatest Rock Album of All Time to the Soundtrack for the Summer of Love (1967). It's also been called the first ""concept album."" But if you take away all the ""hippie zeitgeist"" that accompanied its release, then it, like other Beatles albums, is just another collection of songs. John Lennon even admitted as much, saying that, other than the ""theme"" song and the reprise of same toward the end, the album's songs could have ended up on just about any other Beatles album. No ""concept album"" here. And inspiration? ""Good Morning, Good Morning"" was stolen from a corn flakes commercial. ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" was lifted almost word-for-word from a circus poster. ""A Day in the Life"" was two song fragments that would have ended up on the cutting room floor had they not been ""joined"" together by George Martin. All this and a song about Meter Maids, too."
2,Sgt. Pepper,"Often incorrectly highlighted as the Beatles' most influential album (the early albums had demonstrably more impact in the future direction of popular music than Sgt. Pepper), this album offers several interesting tracks, but equally as many weak offerings. OK, but not as inclined to be played today as the group's earlier work."
4,Sgt. Pepper's vs The Velvet Underground & Nico,"Before Sgt. Pepper, no one seriously thought of rock music as actual art.To clarify, the Velvet Underground's Andy Warhol produced album came out six monthes prior to Sgt. Pepper's. So, I guess it wouldn't be very accurate to say that no one seriosuly thought of rock music as actual art before the Beatles made this album. Also, who is it that considered rock music as actual art after this album? Like Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes it seems like a rock band as pop art wouldn't be very distinguishable from the real thing."
3,"Not wholly satisfying, but worth it...","I have trouble saying that anything (with the exception of RUBBER SOUL) is as satisfying as the Beatles 1 album. How can it not be-with hits like ""Let it Be"", ""Hey Jude"", ""Get Back"", and ""Penny Lane""? It may register higher than the White Album. SGT. PEPPER is their masterpiece, but it is a flawed masterwork. And it is not quite as good as it should be. ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" is great and so is ""A Little Help"" and ""A Day in the Life"" will make you laugh, weep, and be distraught. However, the entire thing is not very adept at what we want, so it can't be put before the ""Let it Be"" fillibuster."
1,Don't Fall For It,"""Before Sgt. Pepper no one seriously thought of rock music as actual art. That all changed in 1967..."". Says who? To hold this album out as ""art"" any more than other leading albums of 1967 is simply biased.First, this isn't rock music. Some of it is pop, and the rest, well, is ragtime, Indian, etc.Second, the real ""art"" was being released by Jimi Hendrix (Are You Experienced) and Cream (Disreali Gears) in 1967, which have certainly stood the test of time better than ""When I'm 64"".The song ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is great. So is ""A Day In the Life"". You can get these on the Beatles greats hits compilations. And those are the only two songs you need out of Sgt. Pepper. Mathematically, 2 songs out of 13 is worth less than one star. Sorry."
2,What Do They Have in Common?,"The Beach Boys, Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Marvin Gaye....all have albums that rank higher than Sgt. Pepper on VH1's Best Ever Poll. I guess it just depends which poll you pick?...."
1,INNER GROOVE,"When my family used to play this sick old record I really had to laugh and enjoy myself tremendously as the recrod hit the inner groove ""we never do see Alice underwear"" or whatever ghibberish it said.CHANCES ARE a 100 out of 99 that the INNER GROOVE is skipped altogether from CD reelases which is a very sad affair!!The record itself is a narcoleptic misconception but I could listen to that inner groove for hours!!"
1,all will be revealed in time,"S.P.L.H.C.B.I remember reading in a 1966 London Newspaper the following header:Senior Policeoffers Lack Heriditary Control Ban.AND THE RECORD WAS JUST NOT MADE YET, SO MY THOUGHT IS THEY WERE ON DRUGS READING ANEWSPAPER.the only good songs with lyrics are flying and the meany theme.Bravo, et all!"
1,just wondering,Thanks for reading my review. I have only one short consideration.What wood this disk have sounded like WITHOUT intoxicating substances? You TThank you!
5,"Incredible album, incredible","This album is very incredible for a few reasons. One, it's so diverse in it's songs, yet the album flows excellently (hell, it goes from ""Within You Without You"" to ""When I'm 64"" and doesn't skip a beat. That's not easy.) Two, it blew away every notion about what rock and roll was and what it could be. The rules broken on this album are lost on todays youth (including myself) because rock bands today have drawn so much from this album. The Beatles revolutionized rock on this album, and thank God they did."
3,"I am not sure I have anything new to say, but . . . . .","Not one of us can avoid ""Sgt. Pepper's"" infiltration into the fabric of American cultural life, whether we like it or not. Nonetheless, there is nothing about it that can compare to ""Revolver"" or ""Abbey Road."" It is an entirely unchallenging piece of music. Yes, the album is enjoyable as second-hand listening. As such, it is a soundtrack, a mood-piece, the embodiment, in fact, of the late 20th century version of happiness and joy: pure, dreamy pop."
5,Great Album,"If you've never heard the Beatles before, this album will sound a tad strange. However, it grows on you, and pretty soon you'll understand why this is some of the Beatles' best work"
5,Beatles at their silliest,"Sgt. Pepper is the only Beatles album that fully captures their sense of humor. Although the movie ""A Hard Day's Night"" was wickedly funny the music in it wasn't especially. Now comes Sgt. Pepper with songs and music that cracked me up... Good Morning, Mr. Kite, Lucy in the Sky, She's leaving Home (""fun is the one thing that money can't buy""). It's as if Richard Lester himself wrote those songs. The Beatle's comedic talent that eventually found its way into their music was in its own way as outrageous as ""Seinfeld."""
2,Sgt. Pepper,"There are three really great songs on here - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Sgt. Pepper (reprise), and A Day in the Life. While this is great, the rest of the album doesn't really rock.If you haven't heard this, don't expect the sound of the early Beatles that made them so popular. When I'm Sixty Four is like some ragtime number. Getting Better and Good Morning, well, are being used as commercial jingles now. Within You Without You is almost universally agreed upon as the weakest point of this album. Fixing A Hole, Lovely Rita, and the Benefit of Mr. Kite are OK, but kind of mediocre.The summary is that this album starts strong and finishes strong, but there's a huge valley in the middle on tracks 7 & 8 (Mr. Kite and Within You Without You) that is tough to get over.Biased Beatle fans give this 5-stars, which is fine, but it's really a 2 or 3 star album."
3,Yawn,"Sorry folks, but this album just doesn't age well. Rubber Soul is much better, as is the White Album. By working so hard to be the hippest thing on the planet in 1967, the Beatles produced an album that defines its own moment but now stands as an anachronism. I'd rate this one right up there with the Moody Blues' Days of Future Past. The self-conscious ""artistry"" of each of these recordings dates them horribly."
2,get something better,"this cd is ok, but i'd recomend KoRn much more than this especially ""follow the leader"" or the self titled album ""KoRn""."
5,YOU MUST HAVE THIS CD!,"It is not because I want to fit in with the majority that I say this is my favorite Beatle album and one of the best over-all of all time. It's because there are so many good songs on it. Out of the 13 tracks on this album, there is only ONE that I don't like (How many other albums can you say that about?), which is George's heavily Indian influenced ""Within You Without You."" The others are simply great and fun to listen to. One person on this board has said that songs such as ""Lovely Rita"" are ""silly,"" or that ""When I'm 64"" is ""hopelessly retro."" These are two of my favorite songs on the album BECAUSE of those qualities. Songs like these help you forget all the sometimes drab realities of life and just have FUN. Another of my favorites on here is ""Sgt. Peppers Reprise."" I usually don't like reprises, but this one just makes you want to get up and dance. If you own no other Beatle CD's, go out and get this one. You won't be disappointed. :-)"
2,The most overated album in rock history,"I guess if you appreciate music this album is a let down. If you prefer listening to Pink Floyd's ""Ummagumma"" ,with all of it's ""groundbreaking"" soundeffects over something with more musical integrety-say ""Exile On Main Street"" then I'm sure Sgt. Peppers will be right up your alley. I would take any Beatles album from '65 up over this collection of corney carnival tunes. After the first three songs it's all downhill. The most overated album indeed!"
2,Sgt. Pepper,"If you like light pop music along the lines of Fixing A Hole or When I'm 64, this album is for you. If you are looking for good 60s rock music, look elsewhere. A Day in the Life and the title track are good, but they don't save the album. Sgt. Pepper sounds more dated than any other Beatle album, with the possible exception of Rubber Soul. 2 stars"
2,Sgt. Pepper,"VH1 did a poll of hundreds of music luminaries and Sgt. Pepper ranked #2 of albums released in 1967. While this ranking seems a little high, there are a handful of good tracks on here that can be picked up on one of the greatest hits albums to avoid the filler on Sgt. Pepper. 2 stars."
5,Great CD,"Haven't listened to the Beatles in some time. I live in Las Vegas and family is coming to visit and we are taking them to see ""LOVE"". I have seen it once before and it is fantastic. I bought this CD and Magical Mystery Tour to get ready for the show. I simply forgot how good they were and the CD is a classic. My favorite song on this is......impossible to choose. Sorry for the people who didn't grow up with this group and missed all of the excitement.Buy this!"
1,Cant Match Pet Sounds,"This was the Beatles effort to out-do Brian and The Beach Boys on Pet Sounds. While I still think it is a good album, sgt. pepper doesent come close to the production on pet sounds. And the Beach Boys are/were the best sounding vocal group of all time."
1,What's the point?,"In this day and age, is there really any need for this sort of pompous twaddle. I mean, wasn't that sort of pop music just a dead end?Save your money, just buy a copy at a garage sale where they never lack for copies of the LP."
2,Over-rated,"For many years 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' topped nearly every single magazine Best Album list, which amazed me since 'Revolver' and 'Rubber Soul' were far superior and were usually relegated to much lower positions on these lists. But lately, music critics have realized that this is, in fact, not even close to a top-ten album.By Beatles standards, this is the second worst album they released (Abbey Road finishes dead last). While I admire the experimental recording techniques, the bulk of the songs are twee and silly. Plus, there are NO rockers on this album! At least the Stones indulged in some rock riffing on their own sub-standard psych record 'Their Satanic Majesties Request'.For some GOOD psych, research The United States of America, Love, Silver Apples, Tomorrow, Red Crayola, Hollies, Amboy Dukes, The Creation, Smoke, The Move, The Action and West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. These bands have what the Beatles failed to deliver."
5,The Pinnacle Of 20th Century Music,"This in the greatest musical masterpiece of all 20th century music, regardless of category. The only other competition comes from the Beatles themselves, as Abbey Road, Revolver, and Rubber Soul are also phenomenal in their brilliance."
5,The greatest of the greats!,"Frankly, the album has obviously secured itself the ""classic"" title. Honestly, how could it not? While many feel it to be over-rated and pretentious, the impact it had on pop-culture, and the impact it continues to have, is simply massive. It is a fair assumption that there will never be another band like the Beatles, and by extension another album like Sgt. Pepper. While this is rather sad, it's also for the best. Anyone who loves the album shouldn't have a problem with this fact, as they can simply put on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band; thirty-nine minutes of music that changed the world."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ANY GOLFER,"I keep this one right in my golf bag. I'm convinced that any high handicapper could take thirty days to practice the thirty simple yet very practical drills shown in this guide and lower their score by thirty strokes. I go out onto the course now with at least a half a dozen mental images that help me to get right back on track after a bad hole. A great book, a great help. A book that gave me the confidence to finally file for a handicap rating at the local club...One I wouldn't be embarassed by."
4,uNiQuE & sPuNkY!,"I thought that this book was a lot of fun to read. I enjoyed all the characters very much, but my favorite was Mab (a pinkie-sized fairy). She was so spunky and truthful, what's not to love about a mini teenage girl that speaks her mind? The story itself was tragic, but with characters such as Mab, Barbie, Griffin, and Todd, it was a very exciting and colorful book to read. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in modern fairytales and likes to be entertained."
5,inspiring,"This is such a beautiful book. Francesca Lia Block appeals to Y/A in this book, and demonstrates the growth of a girl and self-confidence with her vivid use of the english language and symbolism. If I was ever to have a daughter, I would want her to read this book."
4,I was a Teenage Fairy,"'I was a Teenage Fairy' was a really good book. It's really adventurist and the little fairy in the book is cute.The fairy is 13 years old and has an attitude, but changes it through the book.Francesca Lia Block is a good writer and she makes me want to read another one of her books!"
5,loved it - magical,francesca lia block is one of my favorite writers - her stories are so magical and beautiful. this is a great choice for any teenage girl
1,help finding a mate for gay friend? DUMB BOOK,Really did not like this book. The story is about helping find a boyfriend for the main character's guy friend. This book went into the garbage can. 0 stars
5,EXTRA EXTRA READ ALL ABOUT IT......,I have been reading the Jennie McGrady series since I was 12. Along with the Helen Bradley also. I find both series very interesting. Patricia Rushford writes beautifully. I only wish I had her talent. Not too long ago I got to meet her personally. She visited me and my family to come talk to my school about being an author. Along with writing books. She is a wonderful bubbly person who has an excentric personality and energy to do anything. I found that she is a lot like her characters. The first book I ever read was #3. It was addicting. I had to start from the beginning. So I did I have now read every one except for her latest McGrady book. I know that I will also enjoy this one as well. So please read her facinating books. All of the series!
5,super great... forceing my dogs wait till santa comes!,i got these in about 4-5 days after payment.i gave them one each when i got them. and put the rest away for Christmas...well my dogs didn't stupid they go up the the closet and sniff every time i open it lolso i assume they loved them
2,poorly written cliched romance,"I picked this up in hopes that it was written by one of my favorite authors, but was hugely dissapointed. The writing is just not very polished at all. It was written in the sixties, so might be seen as a vaguely interesting artifact from that time, but there are much better books that can give you the flavor of the sixties. I believe that this is a first book, as it seems to hit many of the cliches of romance. The characters are okay, but nothing special, and the plot is so cliched as to be embarrasing. I honestly cannot recommend it."
2,Very Very boring workout,"It is not a bad workout, but they repeat the same move too many times.I know some of Jillian and Billy Blank workout are annoying because they change moves too many times.But this one is just too boring to follow.What's up with her asking the man to move her step. She workout and has tons of muscle, can't even manage to move the step? come on..."
1,QC is lacking,"$99? I don't think so - maybe $20. I think you can find most of these for free on the internet. Contracts may be ok - but the format is soo ugly its tough to work with - no indents on 3 4 levels of content. Try reading finding secion 1.A.ii when 1, A, and iii are all the same format. Some of the pages have the first line cut off when they photocopied. Lot's of other things but my copy is getting sent back."
5,great,"What a great way to get everything organized and running smoothly. This book is the thing that saved me from mayhem and ithank God and the writer for its existence. I've always had trouble with understanding contracts and the thing that stoped me and my company from faster speeds was the paperwork, not the excelent coding my employes did. A great book with great explanations, a definite buy"
2,Somewhat disturbing.,"I started reading this book because the title itself seemed interesting.. The idea of the book seemed good.. The begining was interesting enough, but far too soon did I know who the killer was, and.. well let me sum up the book for you:A female had pepper spray sprayed up her, and her face set on fire.A girl was raped on a stage during a rave.A number of peoples heads are cut offI'm not saying the book was terribly written. It had a few good points, it was an interesting style of writing. It was the extreme vividly explain killing, he went way overboard on explaining each way someone was killed, and the whole pepper spray was a bit.. disturbing."
5,My son loves this!!! Colourful!,"I bought this last week. Assembling was very easy, hardly took 15 mins. My son now sits only on this since it's very colourful. Excellent for kids 1.5-6 yrs. He plays in this, writes, colours everything on this now. Some times he drags this all the way to living room to watch tv sitting on this chair. He likes to sit on this more than $2000 worth of sofa set. I recommand this to all kids of similar age."
4,Well built and worth the money,"I got this product today and was first impressed by how sturdy it felt. Assembly consisted of screwing on the legs. My only complaint is that the stools are more suited to younger kids -- they are kind of short. However, my 6yo told me he loves it.I believe this table is best suited to 3-5 year olds."
3,Parts are great.,"If you are reading this review, you have probably already formed your own opinion of P P & M long ago. I am a big fan of these early, Warner Bros. P P & M albums. With this album, they continued their move away from pure folk music toward jazz-influenced vocals. It has some excellent tracks (Love City for one), but it also has a few weak tracks. I think that most of the other Warner Bros. albums from before their break-up were better, overall. Be smart, like me, and buy them all! PS: I hate it when people slam Peter, Paul and Mommy, their children's album. I love it, and had children primarily so that I could play it for them!"
5,You never know what is going to happen next,"In this book ""Shattered Mirror"" the story is in great detail, but at the same time it was easy to follow and understand. In every twist, your adrenaline is rushing with such intensity that you never want to put the book down. I was so into this book that i read it in one night. It was so extreme that i had shivers up my spine as i read it. i give this book a 4-star rating for the great details and the interesting plot."
4,Entertaining Story by the Vampire Queen Herself!,"This is a great story of forbidden love, a vampire huntress falls in love with a vampire now if that isn't breaking the vida law then I don't know what is. She also puts her life on the line a number of times to avenge her ancestors on a horrid yet intoxicating vampire named nicholas. This is a story of action and love hate relationships a great novel the best winter read on a dark night it will let you escape into the dark gothic mists of rhodes latest most intriguing novel."
1,Maybe I got a lemon...,"After reading the great reviews of this phone I bought one and had nothing but trouble. The battery made poor contact with the phone contacts, so I added tape and seemed to solve that one. Then it started going dead and I had to unplug it, pop out the battery and essentially ""reboot"" it. THen sometimes if you got more than ten feet away from the base the static was total. Eventually my wife ordered me to give up on it.Too bad tho, like the ergonomics, the sound was excellent, and when it worked it was a great phone. Maybe I got a lemon.Amazon however handled it great, giving me my money back!"
4,A *must* for every Windows BASIC programmer,"As good as Daniel Appleman's book is, I guess most publishers and authors felt writing a competing book wasn't worth the effort. Thanks goodness neither the author, nor Wrox felt that way.This book is not a replacement for Appleman's book. But it sure is a lot easier to read and makes a great companion. It's better organized, allowing you to search for API entries based on the type of task you want to overcome.This is the author's first effort, so it's only 360+ pages. Not bad. If I were to offer one complaint, it would be that there is no companion CDROM. At $40 (retail), it's odd for a computer book not to include one."
4,"Good, but not for beginners","A lot of people have mixed feelings about this book. But i think it really depends on your level of programming. If you are a absoloute beginner to the Win32 API, then forget this book, it'll just get you lost. If you have a little experiance in the API, (for example, i had used the API for a few BitBlt functions), then this is a good 'next level' book. If you have no idea what i mean when i say 'BitBlt Functions' then this book probably isn't for you. This book is a good reference and fairly useful when troubleshooting API problems, and it also goes a bit beyond the Win32 API which can be informitive. I enjoyed reading this, and escpecially building the encryption program that this book helps you compile along the way, but as i said before it really matters what skill level you are at."
3,Reasonable introduction,"Don't expect to be spoon fed with lists of handy API calls! You have to go out and find them yourself. But this book explains where to look, how to declare your calls and the pitfalls to avoid.Some good examples but could have doen with more of them"
4,Funny yet concious without lousing there lyical approach,"The bizarre ride to the pharchyde there first album was good. On that album it sounds like they had fun and thats what hip hop is suppose to sound like. People might think them being from Los Angeles they have to talk about guns or gang life but its everything just the opposite. If you like creativity, good beats,and a rap group with a sense of humor then pick up this album."
5,Hip-Hop Album of the decade,"Anyone who likes the hip-hop sound with a little bit of mellow atmosphere to it, then this is the album for you. A CD that truly never goes out of style. A definite buy to add to any hip-hop fan's arsenal."
4,GOOD Solid Disc,I really Enjoyed This Disc.it had alot of Styles&Flavors going on.Tight Raps&Grooves through out.A Very Underated Group.this Disc is Still Good.
4,A great guide.,"I am a first time dog owner and DogSpeak was a big help in understanding dog behavior. This book was GREAT! The writing was clear and simple and I got the sense that the trainer really knew how to read dogs. Some may argue that the tips in the book aren't exactly revolutionary, but they don't have to be! The basic techniques in this book, along with my own persistence and patience, are what helped me train my own dog. I highly recommend this book."
2,Revolutionary?!?!,"Despite the author's statement, there is nothing revolutionary about this book. In fact, many suggestions in it are falling by the wayside (paper training, ""corrective jerk"") as we learn more positive, fun ways to work with our dogs. Although it contains great suggestions for selecting a dog, other books have better all-around advice; for example, ""A Simple Guide to Puppies."" For true enlightenment on dog communication, read Patricia McConnell's delightful ""The Other End of the Leash."" Leave this one, with its aggressive approach to training, on the shelf."
1,waste of time and money,I should have read the reviews a little closer. This is not a Bon Jovi authorized documentary. You can find better discussions on YouTube. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Smells like an old man,bought this sight unseen after the reviews were great...This cologne reminds me of a middle lower class man who is in his mid to late 50s who wears an Hawaiian shirt. Doesn't smell classy or sophisticated at all. Way to strong smells obnoxious..
2,"Hello, Sue are you there??","What a major disappointment. Glad to see that I wasn't the only one who actually went to the bookstore to see if my copy had a chapter missing.Go figure. The characters were weak, the plot never took off, Kinsey seemed like a moron, and let's not even talk about the ending that never was. Since I really enjoyed all the others (well N was a little weak) I guess I can cut Sue some slack. Sure hope this was a temporary lull."
2,P is not perfect,"Having read all the other letters in this series, I was eager to get my hands on this one. But I was terribly disappointed. The plot was less than creative. The amount of material provided on the medical profession slowed it to a snail's pace. The sub plot, which dealt with two handsome brothers was far more interesting but under developed. Perhaps because ""O is for Outlaw"" was such an excellent novel that this suffers in comparison. I recommend allowing the 'P' to remain silent and wait for 'R'"
3,P is for Pages Missing?,"This is the first time I can say I was disappointed in a Kinsey Millhone book. Sure they're all kinda light, but they're always fun and manage to hook you early on with enough suspense to keep you turning pages. Here I was just left bored. Her main case took a back seat to her secondary story line which I thought became trivial and left neatly tied up with Kinsey not even seeming to deal with what happens. Did I miss something here? And the resolution to the first case slips right on in at the end which offers a murderer, but just a hint at the reason. Believe me, I get it, but it just all seemed too pat. Additionally, there's no wrap up at the end which at least brings the case to a final resolution. I hope ""Q"" is for quality plot lines."
2,P is for Petered-Out,"Sue Grafton is a good writer and Kinsey Milhone is still an interesting character, but the series seems to be losing its momentum. The title is somewhat misleading since there is very little peril or tension for the main characters. The insurance fraud subplot is a stretch: Kinsey is a PI, but she doesn't think to check the investigator's references or story? The ending seems rushed and doesn't really give a sense of why the killer acted as he/she did. It's a book that's a good summer diversion, but not fulfilling enough for Grafton/Kinsey fans."
3,"Great beginning, middle but not-so-great ending.",The beginning grabbed me...in fact the book grabbed me. I couldn't put it down and was very intrigued with where the poor Dr. vanished to and then who the murderer was. BUT...I was really dissapointed with the ending. When I read books I have a movie of what I'm reading playing out in my head. When the climax came at the end I turned that page and the movie reel snagged. I re-read the last few pages and although I tried to guess at what the author was saying it would have been nicer if it was spelled out nice and neat for me. My brain works hard during the week and my book breaks are my vacation. No one likes to work during their vacation! I also didn't like having to guess at what the author was thinking. Write for the masses...those of us whose brains are on holiday and need all the help they can get!
2,P is for PATHETIC ending...,"We have read all of the Sue Grafton Alphabet mysteries. Up until ""P Is for Peril"" they were all very engrossing and we could hardly put them down till we were finished. This one is the first of the series that we didn't like very well. We had trouble staying with it. And the ending was unlike any of the previous books. It was as though Sue Grafton forgot to finish the story. We hope and pray that she has not forgotten how to write! ""Q"" should give us the answer.It is rather scary what Sue says in her statement on the copyright page. Is she joking? We hope so. Her previous works were excellent. We pray this book is not the first of her works that a new reader may pick up. We would hope they would want to start with ""A"". If they do, they will get hooked as we were, and have many great books too read...till this one. This book is definitely not up to par for Grafton.Corrine and Ray"
2,Not Impressed,Ummm...I'm an avid Grafton fan and have dutifully read all of this series. I was not impressed this time--sorry to say. There were too many characters and too many plots. The most interesting was the sub-plot involving the 2 brothers. I think that would have made a most interesting book. I was surprised/disappointed at the ending. I'm still wondering whodunit.
3,P is for Puzzled,"P is for puzzled, as I think most fans will be when they reach the end of this book. I have read and enjoyed all the alphabet books, and have really enjoyed Kinsey and her eccentric band of friends and relations. But there was far too little of that in this mystery. The story of the missing physician Dow Purcell was fairly uninvolving. The people in his life were people you cared little about, and the solution, or lack of one, at the conclusion of the book is very puzzling. Although I think I understood what Kinsey ""was looking at all along"", it surely could have had a much clearer ending. The secondary story line involving the Hevener brothers was far more interesting, and also left quite a few ends dangling. I expect Mariah Talbot to turn up in Q is for Quarry. Lets hope it's a better addition to the series than this. The book would normally rate 2 stars, one star is awarded because I still like Kinsey."
4,I can't get on board...,"the disgruntled Grafton fan train.I found P is for Peril to be engaging, and a fast read. I liked the whole idea of Tommy Hevener (time for a new romance, younger guy, good chemistry) so the twist that Grafton adds to make him a bad guy was unexpected and added to the plot.I do agree with many of the other reviewers that the plotting of ""P"" is a little light and Kinsey isn't at her best when she's not really interested in what she is doing. I liked some of the new characters - particularly Anica & Mariah Talbot (Sue G...perhaps a break to make one of them the heroine of a book not in the series?) I always appreciate more of Henry, but not enough of Sue's other usual regulars in the cast. Finally, I liked the guessing game you can play with the ending, although I'm a creature of habit & missed the ""respectfully submitted..."" piece.Still looking forward to ""Q"" and glad that Grafton has kept Kinsey alive, well, and cynical as ever!"
2,Peril's no pearl,"If you told me this book was written by a Grafton wanna be, I'd believe it. I can't remember an alphabet book in which, when the murderer was revealed, I didn't say ""Oh, yes! NOW I remember that subtle clue."" No clue here. I can't remember an alphabet book in which the ending didn't contain a muscle workout for Kinsey in a truly perilous situation. Not here. Further, part of the plot contains a very complex corporate structure involving fraud. The structure makes no sense whatsover to anyone who knows even the basics of business. This simply wasn't a good book. If it were ""A"", there'd be no B."
2,P is for Phantom Ending,"I love Sue Grafton, although in her last 3 or 4 books I have figured out who the killer is by the middle of the book, Ms. Grafton seems to have taken this complaint to heart and decided she would not tell us how this one ended at all. Considering she left everyone of her readers hanging on an abrupt assumption leaving us no choice to make up our own ending. This reader feels that makes all of us co-authors and entitles us to partial proceeds of the sale of this book. It's a good thing I am not Kinsey Millhone, because if I was, I would use my normally exceptional detective skills, hunt down Ms. Grafton and beat her with this book. Kinsey and the readers that love her deserved much better. I tried to call Kinsey to get her take on this, but her answering machine said she was busy on a new case...out looking for the ENDING TO THIS BOOK"
3,"I have to agree, not the best letter of the alphabet!","I was very eager to start on ""P"" is for Peril, to catch up on Kinsey. I am glad the library found me a copy and I didn't spend the money buying the book if that tells you anything. I think I became interested and could actually tell what was going on in the last quarter of the book. I'm surprised Kinsey was led on by Mariah....the brothers....the old bat who hired her...Crystal and her daughter... Oh well. By the way, how old is Kinsey going to be when we reach ""Z""?"
3,P is for Paperback,"A mystery hound, I go through two or three each week, buying most of them in paperback lest I blow the rent money on my book habit. I make an exception for a handful of favorite authors and series, including, until now, Sue Grafton's alphabet murder series. I should have waited for the paperback. P is for Peril drags, the plot limping along, bogged down amid lots of tedious health industry terminology. The wit that characterized earlier books in the series has gone flat as well. As others have noted, the book ends abruptly; it left me with the sense that perhaps the publisher was clamoring for a draft, with the whole project uninspired and behind schedule. Perhaps Ms. Grafton has hit a mid-alphabet slump. In any event, I am not going to be quick to throw the hardcover Q is for Quarry in my cart."
1,ending? what ending?,"Until i read the reviews on amazon.com, i thought i had purchased a defective book, i even went as far as returning to the book store that i purchased it from to look through all the other ""P"" is for Perils to see if pages were missing!!!!! i am a huge sue grafton and kinsey milhone fan, but i was major dissapointed in this book. i brought this book on vacation with me because i wanted a ""light"" and enjoyable read, and i got it until the ending. Sue, you have let me down (too bad you can't refund me my money!!!)."
1,upset,Although most of the reviews stated this book would leave you withunanswered questions I at least thought I would be able to finish it. It only downloaded 514 pages of this book :(
1,P is for....,"PLEASE...somebody who pretends to have understood the ending, explain it here. Start your review with a disclaimer not to read any further if you don't want to know the ending. Those of us who seriously thought we'd gotten a book with missing pages at the end would like your insight. If you're one of the reviewers (a minority to be sure) who thought the ending ""subtle and clever"" you should point out what clues the rest of us missed.Until I hear from you, I'll have to conclude that this book had no ending. It was a murder mystery that (at least for me) didn't answer any of the ""who"" ""how"" and ""why"" questions."
4,Grafton is back in top form,"After a disappointing O is for Outlaw, Grafton writes another great chapter in the Kinsey Millhone saga. The story was thoroughly enjoyable, and included all the characters.The ending was different. This time, Kinsey does not ""sign off"" in a postscript chapter, and the last page was vague. In fact, I even compared my book with a new copy because I was convinced mine was missing a chapter. Aside from the unsatisifying ending, the book as a whole was excellent."
4,Great Reading,"I think P is for Peril is a very well-written book. It's a mystery and I haven't read that many mysteries lately, but I liked this one. The main plot is that Dr. Dowan Purcell has been missing after he left a nursing home. Instead of being hired by his current wife, Crystal, Kinsey Millhone is hired by Fiona, his ex, to find him. Then there is also the part about Tommy and his twin, and Kinsey finds out about their dark past.This is the first Kinsey Millhone mystery I have read, and I think she did a great job. Grafton gets you into a book and you just want to know what's going to happen next. Now that I have read this book, I think I will go and grab one of her earlier ones before reading Q."
1,P is for Pathetic,"I like Grafton's books. They are not as heavyweight as Nevada Barr or Sara Paretsky, but I have read them all and am currently enjoying U is for Undertow.My advice is to skip P is for Peril. It seemed pointless and boring. Another reviewer wrote that she had just switched publishers. Maybe that explains it. Something in the process was definitely missing for this one. It gives the impression she shouldn't have bitten off the obligation to write 26 books in the series. Thankfully, the later books have improved."
3,"DETECTIVE FICTION, OR TRAVELOGUE?","I enjoy the Alphabet novels, but this one struck me as a bit flabby, and I went back and checked. Sure enough, A Is For Alibi ran to 368 pages, which was about right, but this manages to stretch things out for 513, which is about a hundred too many. I noticed that every time Kinsey climbs into her car we're exposed to a detailed account of her journey, and every new house she visits receives a detailed description. This adds nothing to the plot, but slows down the action. I can only surmise that Sue Grafton's publishers have prevailed on her to increase the size of the book. But for whatever reason, she'd be well advised to cut out the padding, and revert to writing crisp plots, as she used to."
4,Great Entertainment!,"I've read every one in this series of mysteries over the years. I always look forward to getting the latest novel. (...) Over the last number of novels Grafton has taken her novels more to the realmof suspense than mystery. Earlier novels invited us to follow along. All the clues were there, we just needed to be observant. Now the novels don't really allow that. It's always fun to read and I've come to almost think Kinsey Millhone is real. The stories aren't as good as they once were. But the writing and character developements is still as good if not better than previous novels. As long Sue keeps on writing, I'll keep on buying"
3,Where's The Last Chapter??????,"I am an avid fan of Grafton's A-O mysteries, and couldn't wait to dive into ""P is for Peril."" I found the story satisfying enough, if you don't count Kinsey's sudden, albeit short-lived, transformation into an air-headed bimbo. (At times I didn't recognize her as the self-assured, no-nonsense character from the previous 15 books.) I was blind-sided, however, by the abrupt ending of the book. I read the last chapter twice trying to make sense of it. Then I returned to the beginning of the book and skimmed through each chapter trying to find what I must have missed in order to understand the ending.When a writer puts out a series of books like these, there should be a few constants the reader can hang his/her hat on. The wrap-up at the end, (""respectfully submitted"") is one of those constants, I think. I was SURE I got a defective copy that was missing the final chapter. I even took it back to the bookstore to exchange it for one that was complete......no such luck."
4,Missing Ex,"Kinsey gets a call from Fiona. She is Dr. Purcell's ex-wife and is concerned that he has been missing for nine weeks. Fiona believes he ran-away from Crystal his present wife. Everyone has their own idea of what had happened to Dr. Purcell but no facts. Kinsey finds herself in danger but continues until the mystery is solved. You will like the intrigue of this book. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
2,Phenomena II is fantastic music...,"Great songs, great voices, mixed together in a project. Well, i really don't know how to explain what i feel when i listen to this cd. It's just amazing music. Here, in Brazil is almost impossible to find this cd. Thanks amazon.com to have this available..."
1,Saw II,"Saw II-Same Formula. Sorry but Despite it's Drama and it's So-called Horror, I don't mind gore when necessary in a Horror movie to get it's point across. but The Saw Series which By the way I have only seen up to 3 I think. Is plain torture porn, I don't like torture to such extremes, It's all it is,that and Hostel . there is no value in such a movie. And then the guy come on? oh well. maybe my bias would make others think I am crazy for not liking the movie, but I apologize it's not my type of movie, watch/rent it and see if you like it."
2,Announce your spoiler,"The person before me typed a massive spoiler for the movie and didn't feel the need to tell people. Nice job kid. My view of the movie was this. I really liked the first Saw, and HATED this sequel. This movie was more of a teenage slasher movie with grossout, nasty killings without thought behind them. Just ways to maim people. The first movie wasn't just about that, there was plenty of story to keep it going. This just didn't have it. Not recommended."
3,"Oh yes, there will be blood","Not nearly as good as the first, but more successful at the box office, Jigsaw is back again with another set of games for his hapless victims. This time the main player is a cop, trying to find his son, kidnapped by the twisted and terminally ill Jigsaw. The sequel, with a new director and co-writer, tries to out do the original with its tagline 'there will be blood' and is successful. It is a lot more gory than the first and has a very good twist at the end that I doubt anyone will see coming. There are more players in this 2nd game, and the way Jigsaw traps his victims is a lot more creative. Overall, still a good movie, which will appeal to fans of the first. Most will be rupulsed by the gore and the torture scenes, but those with a strong stomach will enjoy this movie and want to add it to their DVD collection."
1,Boring,"Saw 2, was a mistake, i am upset that i wasted my money renting it. saw 1 was the best, you did not know what to expect, and it was actually scary. i was immune to the Saw 2, i did not flinch once."
3,Not the quality that I expected,"The quality of the product was said to be like new but the cover is torn around the edges, although all the pages are not bent and in good condition. Other than the conditon of the cover I am very satisfied with the purchase. The delivery was quick and I really enjoyed the book."
1,Non-operational most of the time,The printer doesn't work when one of the inks is empty. This is ridiculous considering that for an average user this situation could happen every month. The product is practically unusable. Do not recommend for home or small office use.
2,Lasted a little over a year before croaking,The unit lasted about a year of VERY LIGHT usage. The blank ink just stopped printing.
4,"Brother MFC-5440CN Network Inkjet Printer, Scanner, Copier, and Fax","Very easy to use! Big enough to handle all the functions, yet compact enough to put almost anywhere. Well worth every penny and would recommend it as a ""smart buy""."
1,"If you like buying ink a lot, this is the printer for you","I'm sorry to have to write a negative comment, but the Brother co. deserves it. Most of the bad reviews above are true. I will add one more: it is a pain to print envelopes with this printer, IF you can print them at all. I visited the Brother website to get help with the issue, but no luck, Their suggestions did not fix the problem. The stories about the ink cartridges are true, as well as the constant self-cleaning. I did like the fax/scanner capabilities, but I will never buy a Brother product again.Sorry Brother, you should have fixed the problem before putting this thing out there."
2,becoming me,I was a bit disappointed as I was led to believe that this book would be in very good condition. The binding was cracked and it appeared to be a very used book. Fortunately I bought it for myself so it is not a big problem.
1,Stupid....is a bad word,"The Stupid Family....I think that is a horrible title for a story about any family. It's bad enough that parents call people stupid in front of their children, stupid driver, stupid human, stupid people....but to further carry out STUPID in a child's book....oh gosh....doesn't make any sense to me! The word Stupid in itself is awful and shouldn't be used. My 5 year old who is in all day kindergarden had a project this week...to turn off the television and to read books. I took my daughter to the library today and we did a scavenger hunt of 8 authors....Harry Allard was one of those authors. Viola Swamp was easy to understand...but the Stupid Family isn't. How can people give praise to a story that makes fun of stupid people. Stupid is a very hateful word. Kids shoulnd'nt use the term STUPID at all."
3,Don't see a problem...,"I have found that The Stupids isn't necessarily a BAD book. It really points out to children the things that shouldn't be done, and any sensible person will know to tell their children not to go around calling people names just because of the book. I would also say that this book should be read for age groups of no younger than 2nd grade...so that they can understand the nature of the story and the context in which to take The Stupids. I hope this helps people. :)"
5,Classic,Tom Russell's Poor mans dream is an outstanding album. I could name favourite songs off it but i'd just be naming the whole album. no one can hear this and not have a few heart strings tugged at. A mix of amazing lyrics and harmonic melodies make this one of the best ever recorded.
3,"Good, not great","As a dedicted acoustic music fan I was hoping for more from Linda Lavin's latest attempt at a collection of folk singers. (See the ORIGINAL, ""On a Winter's Night"")Sadly, in my opinion this volume does not live up to the original. Good stuff and we are glad to have it but our recommendation is lukewarm at best."
2,Not a good example of history for students,"While the language isn't boring the the ideas are great in Youngs second edition of this biography, I am not happy at all that my students have been assigned this book to read in a linked course. I teach a study and learning skills course linked to an American history course at a university in the USA and this biography must be read by the students. With all the time spent in the colleges and universities and now in the media about how historians need to cite their sources, this biography is a sad and sorry example. Nothing is cited, even the direct quotes have no citations! Yes, Youngs does discuss his sources at the end of the book but that is not the same as giving credit to the sources where he drew his quotations and facts from. The publisher, Longman, should be ashamed for allowing such poorly cited scholarship to be printed for used in either courses or the general public. I would have given this 1 star but the writing is engaging."
4,"Its sweet, but the legal [stuff is boring]","I like this movie alot. Its a great movie, the combat scenes are realistic. The legal stuff is boring though. It ranks high for me because Im an MC ROTC cadet and my respect for Jackson and Jones. Of course, with out the legalness there would be no movie. I recommend buying this movie. Get it used though and save some money."
4,Service Rules,"I commend the men of the Marine Corp.This movie goes into detail of a ""coverup"" and an honorable man is trashed but proven innicent by jury of his piers."
3,Courtroom Drama,"A good portion of this is set in the courtroom. Samuel L is a Marine officer tasked with guarding the US Embassy in an Arab country. An attack occurs and he is put on trial for violating the rules of engagement. He enlists the help of his friend and former lawyer to find the truth and defend him. Everything in this movie is JUST good (acting, storyline, entertainment value), not great."
3,"good start,so-so plot","movie ok, enjoyable but not worth buying. rent, rent, rent.dvd is in crappy widescreen only - rent the vhs version if you aren't fond of watching only half your tv screen."
2,Completely unbelievable and inaccurate courtroom drama,"Although the acting is top notch in this movie, the unbelievable and inaccurate storyline overshadows the performances of Jackson and Jones. A commanding officer in the situation presented would never act as Jackson does here, moreover a marine as hotheaded as Jackson would never rise to such a command, much less the rank of colonel. Moreover, the courtroom scenes are ridiculous as they in no way resemble the procedure of an actual courtmartial. Improper argument during opening statements, questioning an ambassador as to how he would give orders to troops if he were a military commander, constant cussing during testimony etc. It would never happen. Moreover, it is unbelievable that the National Security Advisor and ambassador would conspire to frame a soldier and destroy evidence in this way. There is too much to risk and little realistically to gain. It makes the movie hard to enjoy. Don't bother."
4,"""People die; sometimes they're innocent but in a war innocent people DIE!""","A contemplative movie in which many questions are asked: Is Yemen a training ground for terrorists? Is Colonel Terry Childers a blood-thirsty murderer?! Or is he a hero defending his soldiers, and complying with the rules of engagement? What are the rules of engagement?An intriguing story, magnificently performed by a wonderful cast namely; Tommy Lee Jones and Guy Pearce but leaves many unanswered questions about what is just and who decides what is just.If rules of engagement were obeyed, which assumes we can define rules of engagement that don't tolerate double standards, many war crimes would've never happened. Sadly enough, we are living in a crazy world of double standards and self appointed superior nations that one should doubt the existence of rules of engagements nowadays."
1,How dare you !,A soldier gives the order to shoot on a crowd of civilians (including kids)...lots of dead.And it seems like the director want us to care about the guyUS army self justification at its worst?
1,"thin, very thin","Besides the distraction of an action sequence, the movie's premise was ridiculous!How can a trial, not to mention a decorated serviceman's life and freedom, depend on whether or not a video tape is recovered or not? What ever happend to ballistics, satallites, DNA... - coming soon- Rules of Engagement II-The Video Tapes Revenge!"
2,I'm being generous,"First of all, I have to say that this movie started out quite well. The Vietnam war sequences were intense and stunning, and it immediately grabbed my attention. The film, however, then starts to get shaky after the Colonel (Jackson), is charged with murder for opening fire on a seemingly unarmed crowd of innocent protesting Yemenese civilians. From this point the film turns into a half-baked courtroom drama, then leaves the viewer with a very premature ending. I think it would have been a better decision on the director's part to actually show how the head of National Security was brought down, rather than just writing about it in the end.If you're looking for a great war movie, get ""Saving Private Ryan"", and if you're looking for an intense courtroom drama get ""A Few Good Men"", or ""A Civil Action"""
2,Stone's Lone Stab at Comedy,"It seems like every great director attempts a comedy at some point in his career. Stone is no exception, and with THE DOORS, he makes an unfortunate foray into feature length hijinks.Don't get me wrong...the film does have some funny moments. The scene where Kilmer follows Pamela Courson home and hangs out in the window is a classic. Pamela sees him and asks why he followed her, and with impeccable comic touch, Kilmer says ""Because you're the one."" Quite a sidesplitter!Unfortunately, the jokes get old after a while, and by the end, you're almost wishing that Stone had taken a more serious approach to the material. Even Morrison's wacky Indian sidekick ends up looking forlorn.My advice, if you want to see a great musical comedy, check out SPINAL TAP. As for Stone, he should leave the one-liners to Woody Allen and stick with heady dramas."
5,Doors fans this is a must have,"This told the story about The Doors through their years up until Jim Morrison died sadly. It gave me a whole new look in the band. Val Kilmer delivers in the great role as one of the best rock and rollers of our time. The Doors have some of the best songs out there and it protrays on how some songswere written. Great DVD..Buy it! I did, It was worth the money! A++"
1,Re-Issue Crap,"Yet another re-issue and shaft job by the movie industry making DVD's, and releasing them with a few more extras one to six or seven years later. Give these crap re-issues one star, not based off the movie, but the shaft job done to loyal DVD customers. If you must buy this release, ALWAYS BUY USED. That way the vultures who play unfair won't make a profit off you. Then sell your old release, which will hopefully deter more people from buying the newer version, with a cheap old version on the market, and will hit these scumbags where it hurts the most... bottom profit line. Voice your anger, ALWAYS BUY USED IF YOU MUST BUY AT ALL, and tell them you're sick of this re-issue anniversary edition crap."
5,Good but some items misenterpreted,"I think this is a great movie. They did a pretty great job with the sound and everything. One thing i didnt like was that some of the opinions in this nivie were different from life. For instance, when the doors appeared on cbs, they were asked not to sing the line "" girl we couldnt get much higher"". As most know, Jim sung it anyway, but it was an accident. Stone made it appear as it was on purpose. Also that one of the other members was made to look like he hated Jim, ehich was not true"
3,NOT THE TRUE STORY,"this movie is pretty good, BUT IT IS NOT THE TRUE STORY boys and girls! read the Ray manzereck book ""light my fire"" and it says i all! Jhon densmore book is pretty accurate too! as a matter of fact read all the doors/jim morrison books because there is where you will find the truth about jim, through books. The only good part in this movie is the concert scene and Val Kilmer! he did a great job playing the fictional Jim Morrison. You want the real thing, buy all Real Doors videos here at amazon. They tell the truth!"
2,What coulda been....,"This film is a poor take on Jim Morrison's life.I suggest picking up ""Riders on the Storm"" by John Densmore or ""Light my Fire"" by Ray Manzarek, both books have their personal accounts and are much more interesting.I mean if you're gonna just make up scenes at least do it for the benifit of the audience and the person you're portraying. At least show a little of Jim Morrison's good side and not just jimbo.<"

3,A Portrait of Pen Hardaway.,"On the bus, I was shocked to find a short fellow who looked like the Lil Penny of Regal fame. Based on the basketball player, he was a delight to watch at the movies of yesteryear. This volume is mostly photos with some personal data to keep the viewer interested."
5,Hilarious!,"I'm not even a huge basketball fan, but you don't have to be to enjoy this book! I am most impressed with the photography, but the text is pretty funny, too. The whole concept just cracked me up. I mean, who ever heard of a book starting on the inside flap? It's a quick read and I recommend it for a good laugh."
1,"Nice bag, lousy strap","The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag. The large can fit a ton of Stuff. Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2"" wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded. The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable. So it sits in the corner; looks nice but not very functionable."
5,Good for dads,"This is a thoughtful and carefully done film about the needs of infants. It includes some great stories from the father's perspective. I particularly enjoyed Noah Wyle's story about his bonding experience with his son. Not much is out there for dads at this time, and I think this film does a good job of including the whole family both in image and word.Although this is not a ""how to"" film, it is extremely informative about development of the infant. It gives you the information and then you get to decide what to do with it. As a father of 2 with one more on the way, it pretty much confirmed what I think, which made me feel good. I also appreciate the support of being more informed when I receive ""parenting advice"" or get into the discussion with my in-laws about why I do things differently than they did. It is definitely a resource for parenting."
3,LCD Screen Failure,"I've had this phone for about two years and it has been great except for one thing. The LCD screen is almost completely useless now. It started losing ""lines"" of pixels both horizontally and vertically. Now enough are gone that memory dialing and caller id are useless on this phone and I am shopping for a replacement."
2,works for two months and THEN,"This phone is the worst, as it makes you think it's the best thing ever after a few weeks of use. BUT THEN... I had the same problems as other reviewers as it was always scanning for a channel during calls. Very annoying. Don't buy this phone. I've noticed that Sony is cutting the price dramatically on this phone to get rid of it from its inventory. Don't buy it."
4,A.H. Armstrong-not D.M. Armstrong,I am just writing to say that if you intend to sell a book for 150$ you could provide the right information about it-the editor is not D.M. Armstrong-it is Arthur Hilary (A.H.) Armstrong-also the foremost translator of Plotinus into English and a leading scholar in the field.
3,Completely different direction from Focus,"This is Focus's fifth studio album, and sixth overall. It is 37 minutes long. The sound is very bright and clear.This is a completely different direction for Focus. Up until now, Focus had been doing long, art rock and progressive rock compositions. Tracks could last up to 30 minutes. This album does not have a track that is over 3 minutes.The music is quite a bit different. Much of it is soft jazz. Many of the tracks were composed by bassist Bert Ruiter (previously, Van Leer did most of the composing, with heavy inputs from Akkerman).I applaud groups experimenting and trying new things. Unfortunately, I don't find anything on this album to be very interesting."
4,Well worth a read,"Garry Wills has done a solid job with this entry in the American Presidents series. He focuses on one simple question: Why was Madison not a great president? Wills, after detailing Madison's pre-presidential achievements, examines his two terms in office with an eye toward certain types of mistakes that Madison made again and again. His research is outstanding; his writing solid."
5,Gary Wills is the greatest,"Is there any better author when it comes to explaining complex personalities in a different time and space than today? I don't belive there is--once again, Gary Wills just nails his argument. It is such a pleasure to read an answer to a question in a concise, thoughtful, and sometimes humorous way. The question--how could Madison be so good at creating a constitution and so mediocre at executing the constitution when he was president? The dearth of information in the popular press about Madison's presidency almost begs the question, ""Why did Jemmy change so much after he turned 40?"" And the answer is that he didn't change his stripes--he was true to himself, both good and bad, as he first advised candidate and president Jefferson and later assumed the presidency himself. Great book."
5,"Absolutely changed my life. Grahl Moxley,Soperton,GA>",A must read for anyone who belives in or is searching for Jeasus Christ
5,Best Season Yet,This was the strongest season to date. It had a season long story arch that involved everyone in the show. This also had the appearance of a new face while Gil was out of town. This added a nice break from the dynamic that we have all gotten used to. It also had one of most entertaining episodes in years (Lab Rats). I can't wait to get my hands on this one.
3,"Happy for the download, but SOOOOOOO Slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I think this service is cool, but the download time on broadband rivals ancient dial-up headaches of years ago. Perhaps the issue is that the quality of the download is so good? (I hope?) In the time it takes for one episode of CSI to download onto my computer, I could have walked to the video store and back TWICE--not to mention that I could have watched the episode twice already. Unless the download speed gets faster, I may not make a habit of using this service, though I was glad Amazon made the prices reasonable to test it out. I am happy to have some CSI episodes to watch at my leisure now (though I feel like I should savor every minute out of them, as they took so long to download, I don't want to waste a pixel!). For cable customers, I guess it would be a more sensible service to use than for us broadband users. More speed to the downloads, please!"
5,A Great Collection,"The songs on this CD are the ones you really want to hear. So often compilations fall short of depicting a great artist because they leave out so much. They usually only have the #1 hits and most requested songs that are already so easy to find. Not this time.Here, the songs are all examples of why Lady Day's name is so closely associated with singing the blues. And in typical Verve fashion, the quality of the recordings is OUTSTANDING.Billie Holiday's voice isn't the most powerful, the most refined, or the most acclaimed, but is it ever inspiring. Her ability to convey sorrow in a ballad is unparalleled. But one of the best things about this CD are the medium tempo'd, swinging songs like ""Cheek to Cheek"", ""All Or Nothing At All"", ""Just One Of Those Things"" and several others. You don't simply get lulled into sadness (for too long).Highly recommended for the Billie enthusiast or casual Jazz fan. This compilation trumps others around it."
5,Excellent Compilation,"Helpful reminder: This is a song for song collection of two albums you may already have; Songs for Distiguished Lovers, and Body and Soul. A great buy."
5,fabulous late collection from Billie Holiday,"Love the sound on both of the CDs; the 2nd CD, which was released as the album Body and Soul, is really amazing - all of the sidemen including Sweets Edison and Ben Webster, do a great job of making the 2nd CD swing. My favorite tracks are Stars Fell on Alabama, One for my Baby, and Just Friends, although the best track for dancing is But Not For Me."
5,BIG UP !!! Born jamericans (once again),"HOTTT!!! CD. All I can say is, it's a must have especially if you are a dancehall fan.There's nothing about this cd I don't like. It's perfect and it bumps in the ride too.Again I would recommend this cd to the world."
4,Great,"This is an excellent film putting a totally different spin on the events also covered in the film The Exorcism of Emily Rose. This film is significantly more boring though. My four star grade is to reflect how excellent the film was. But, please do not be misled...this is a slow paced film that requires patience to see the plot unravel. Recommended if you have an interest in this sort of thing."
4,Wonderful book,"This is the interesting story on how Mad Magazine was created and the interesting life of it's creator, William M. Gaines. Very funny and also very serious. A lot of interesting stories surround Gaines and his empire. I highly recommend it to any Mad fan."
5,Great subliminal program,"I never really believed in subliminal tape programs and was advised to stay away because many of them are merely music and some you have no idea what they are planing in your mind.Because of my respect for Dr. Waitley and the publishers Nightingale-Conant, I went ahead and ordered this program. I felt not only more relaxed and more at ease but I did see a major difference in productivity.I layed off the program for some time and recently had some professional and personal reversals. I dug out those old tapes and started listening to them again and once again, they worked.A lesson I learned was that like exercising, studying or any other positive behavior, for permanent results you need to continue to practice.When I stop, I can feel a difference in mood and performance.Thank you Dr. WAITLEY and Dr. BUDZYNSKI"
2,Dreary and disjointed but good acting and music.,"A rather dreary and disjointed movie, with a good plot, good acting, and an exceptional sound track; but miserable directing. It ends with an anti-climax."
3,Pricey but did the job even though the adaptor plate didn't fit.,"The conversion kit seems very high in price for what you get. The adaptor plate didn't fit on my Cougar 5th wheel as the existing hole is larger than the kit specifies. Many of the parts were not needed especially the cable clamp which was too big to even fit in the metal box which was in the kit. With a few new holes drilled and plenty of caulk, I did make the kit work though. Having a detachable cord rather than stuffing all of that cold stiff cable into that mouse hole is great. I think you could visit an electrical supply shop and customize your own kit for what you need at a much reduced price."
5,Special Fragrance!,"I love Pheromone by Marilyn Miglin. I first received this fragrance from my husband as a gift. Since then, it has become my favorite perfume. It's difficult for me to find this fragrance in local department stores, so I was delighted to discover it advertised at Amazon.com.Pheromone has a clean, pleasant fragrance. I regularly receive compliments from others when I wear it."
5,Wow!,"John Finney is a Seattle firefighter, son of former chief and brother of a captain. Six months before story opens, a long-time friend and partner is killed in a fire and John barely escapes with his life. The rumor is that John panicked and left his partner to die. John is sure he gave directions to the location of partner who is pinned under a beam, but his chief says he was babbling. This is a thriller from page one and doesn't let up.I started right after meeting Earl Emerson at a local bookstore and read nearly straight through the next 2 days."
3,Better than expected....,"This is a fairly accurate gun for the price. I could hit a pull string for a light from 20 feet away. This gun is also VERY powerfull for the price. However, it is cheeply built. The picante sight rail is useless as it will break if you pull it at the wrong angle. This gun is also fairly easy to mod... if anyone wants to."
4,Standard bird,"Some jazz ""purists"" would argue that the idea that Charlie Parker would ever play popular standards is tantamount to selling out. I would suggest otherwise. ""Bird"" added the same new, creative dimension to his recordings of standards as he did with anything else. Furthermore, in doing so, he introduced his music to a group which heretofore had never heard it and may have never unless they could hear some tunes that they actually had heard of. My only complaint about this CD is that most of the standards heard here are not the most well known of all time. But that isn't terribly important."
4,Good Disc,"this disc has some tight Grooves on it.The title cut, Too Much Heaven is a cool slow Jam.Love You Inside Out still sounds Great.I never really Liked Tragedy.but still this disc is a GOOD follow up to S.N.F.their Writing&Production were tight as most of The Grooves.but were forced out of what they were doing well."
3,"Different label, same mediocre album.","This album came out shortly after ""Saturday Night Fever"" so if you liked that album you'll probably like this one too. Even though it's a listenable album from start to finish ,I""ll recommend this album only to serious Bee Gees fans. For the casual fan though, you may like the hits ""Tragedy"" ,""Too Much Heaven"", ""Love You Inside Out"", the title cut and maybe two or three of the remaining tracks. In that case I would suggest sticking with just the hits and go with ""Their Greatest Hits:The Record"" instead."
2,"Despite sales success, not much here","O.K. you're going to find a few goodies here. These are Tragedy, Too Much Heaven, and Spirits (Having Flown). Program your CD player for these. Tragedy is the last great song of their 2nd fame era. This is a song that, when listened to in a vehicle, will induce speeding, simply because of its insistent beat and chorus. Too Much Heaven is a great bit of charity work for UNICEF and the brothers harmonize so well. Spirits (Having Flown) is just a song that will catch your ear for some strange reason and hold you in its grasp. As for the rest of the album, skip it. Uninspiring."
2,Design flaw,"This basketball unit on paper seemed to be the best one out there in this class. However, I have now gone through 2 units and both have a major design flaw. By itself, the base is flat and sits fine. Once you insert one or both posts into it, it is very wobbly. This is due to both posts extend past the bottom of the base surface. The overall build quality is excellent, but this design flaw is forcing us to return this product and search for another brand."
4,Tyke basketball hoop,"My grandsons really enjoy the basketball hoop. The only problem with it is the base. When assembling the stand column to the base, the column projects beyond the level of the base making the base wobbly and unstable. I had to add two 2x4s underneath on either side of the column to stablilize the base. Once that was done it works well."
5,Awesome product!!,My grandson loved the basketball hoop!! He's only one but with the added adjustment this is great for he can use it for awhile. Even though it's plastic it is very sturdy and by adding water or sand it stays put.Ann
2,Good for occasional shoveling,"It works if you need to break the ice and clear the snow around you car every now and then. Otherwise, there are much better shovels out there.Comes not sharpened so might gonna need to do that. Plastic ""D"" shaped handle is not durable but the pole is a solid wood, which is good. The blade is narrow (probably a lot narrower then one would expect). Going back, I'd probably check a local Home Depot to see what else $20 can buy."
5,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,"Carol Welsman is a jewel. Her piano playing and vocals are stellar. This is a must buy cd for anybody who likes jazz, pop and hits. Produced by Yellowjackets Jimmy Haslip."
3,Good value for the price.,"First the bad news about this VCR: The picture didn't knock my socks off. In fact, I couldn't tell the difference between the picture on this JVC VCR and my six year old Memorex VCR. Now on to the better news. This VCR has lots of features. Additionally, you can access almost all of the features from either the VCR's front panel or the remote (which glows in the dark, by the way). I also love the jog/shuttle dial on the front of the VCR--not that I use it much, its just a nice high-end touch for an inexpensive VCR like this. No problems with the VCR either, but I've only had it for five months. Overall I give it three stars. Okay picture, outstanding controls, and all the features a movie-watcher would ever need this side of DVD."
3,"""Yo That's A Lot Of Body""","Friends & neighbours will always remember that loud little boy on the street, who would play one song all day @ the loudest volume possible... ""Yo That's A Lot Of Body""To this day, I reckon that that track has one of the best bass lines ever... you've got to hear it to believe it.Peace!"
3,SMALL AND SIMPLE,"SMALL SIZE, EASY TO CARRY BUT WITH NO PARTICULAR THINGS TO POINT OUT. GOOD FOR BEGINNERS."
3,So-so,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews that this marking gauge isn't the best one out there. It uses a pin instead of a blade to mark the wood, and in the beginning I didn't think this would make a difference. I was wrong. Aft4er I purchased a marking gauge with a blade I could see (and feel) the difference. On the bright side, it looks great hanging in my tool chest....."
3,Choppy,"The book is a choppy read. There are instances where the read flows like water from a Florida spring. However, it can be dry as Texas during a drought. To give it justice you must be a persistant reader."
2,Not as good as some early albums,"This album seems to be boring and more commercial comparing to Renaissance previous albums. If you are a fan of this group, you better get ""Ashes Are Burning"" or ""Prologue"". Even ""Novella"" is better, although my favorite is ""Illusion""."
1,Snapped Like a Graham Cracker,"I'm so disappointed. I used to have this exact model about 4 years ago, but they stopped making it, instead making the model that's most commonly available today. I was thrilled when I saw this model and snatched it up; well, something changed because it's flimsier than I remember. After only two uses, the plastic hole that holds the metal piece which props the whole thing open snapped, rendering the product useless for anything but flat-surface use. Sent it back. Guess I'm going to have to be content with the newer version which is clunkier and has pads that don't really grip the laptop. Damn."
4,Intimo Men's Classic Silk Knit Tank Top,"I love my Silk Tank Tops. I wear them to work under my dress shirts and the feel is very nice. Much more comfie than the Hanes cotton tanks. The quality is very good for the price. The initial fit was just a tad snug, but stretched out just a bit after a couple of washes/wears and is very comfortable now. I tried wearing one on a hike but i find the coolmax type active wear handles sweating much better than silk. But for casual wear, or sleeping at night I love them."
5,A Great Intro for Body Discussions,This book is a great introduction about the function of body parts for little people. I like the idea of starting to talk matter-of-factly with my four year old about how his body works. I hope this will open the door and make future talks about more intimate issues easier.
3,Lento y Algo Aburrido,"La musica de Eagles, es divina todos lo sabemos, pero en este DVD, es un poco monotono y algo aburrido, con la escepción desde luego de ""Hotel California"" Se salva la música, pero el video deja mucho que desear, debería ser mas entretenido, a lo mejor tener otras caracteristicas adicionales..."
2,The Eagles-Hell Freezes Over-...better for ears than eyes,"Although I might keep this DVD in my collection, it would be only for the historical reunion of the Eagles and not for the DVD experience. I enjoy a concert DVD that lets me feel like I'm at the show sonically and visually, and not as if I'm watching a slide show with fading effects. My apologies to the director, but when Joe Walsh is playing a solo I like to watch Joe Walsh play the solo. The sound is okay, but visually the 2 second cut from one band member to the next without regard to the instrumental focus or the activity on the stage was extremely frustrating."
3,"Close, but no cigar","Great songs, great musicianship, terrific production values and sound production, but the band plays as if it is merely turning in a very perfunctory performance.Don't get me wrong. I love the Eagles and have always loved listening to the Hell Freezes Over CD. But this DVD, which features the band's comeback performance for an MTV special, somehow left me cold.The band seems merely to be going through the motions and there is no fire in the gig.It does have its highlights though -- the splendid reworking of Hotel California, Joe Walsh's turn on Pretty Maids All In A Row, the first live performance of the then new song Learn To Stand Still and Timothy B. Schmidt's always-amazing I Can't Tell You Why.On the plus side, the surround soundtrack is among the best you'll find on a msuic DVD."
3,Great for hard core eagles fans,"After reading the many glowing reviews I thought I couldn't go wrong with this DVD and if you're a big Eagles fan this is probably a 5 star DVD. These guys can still sing and play great, but the performance is so layed back it can put you to sleep. The best part of the DVD is that they left ""New Kid in Town"" off."
5,Glad I found them,"By way if the Worthinton web site I found vega links on Amazon. Eureka!! I never knew.I wish I didn't have to order a case, but very happy with a childhood favorite"
4,Great value,"Only problem I have encountered is the subwoofer making the metal on top of my receiver rattle!! That really gets annoying, but I'll simply move the receiver elsewhere. These are a great value, and offer good imaging if placed correctly."
2,Not his best,"I usually enjoy the Kellerman books but this is not his best work. Major medical mistakes- Percocet is not an injectable drug, for example! should have been screened. The characters are uninvolving, and the ending a big letdown after all the work to develop characters."
2,Disappointed,"When I saw Kellerman had a new book coming out, I signed up for it at the library without knowing what it was about, just assuming it was another Alex Deleware book. When I picked it up, I was disappointed that it wasn't, but still optimistic, since I love Kellerman's books. This book is a disappointment. I was well over 100 pages in, and still was not ""into"" the story. The main character, Jeremy, did not draw me in like Alex did in the other books. I didn't feel a connection with Jeremy, and didn't find myself rooting for him, like I do for Alex and Milo. The story is very slow moving, no driving suspense like the Deleware books. I finished the book because I was ""curious"" about how it would end, not because I had a driving need like I do with really good mysteries. I hope Kellerman sticks with the Deleware series, it's a much better read in my opinion."
1,Kellerman is getting worse with experience,"Look, if you want to read a good mystery, stick to Kellerman's early work. ""Butcher's Theater"" is dynamite. This one is pretty darned close to a remake (at least in terms of the villian's MO), but nowhere as imaginative or intriguing. It's time for Kellerman to retire his word processor."
3,wait for the paperback,"This is the first J. Kellerman book I've read. Other reviews will inform you better about the plot itself. My small contribution will focus on the story's degree of suspense. The entire work is only 375 pages. I found that it was not very gripping at all until around page 200. Therefore, I'd rate pages 1-200 with just ONE STAR but pages 200-375 with FOUR STARS. The first 200 pages for me were too full of medical jargon and mundane details of characters lives that failed to interest me. I'm glad I read on. I'd recommend, however, that you either borrow a copy or wait for the paperback! It's the book equivalent of a wait-for-the-video flick in the theaters!"
4,Not bad,"After reading some of the reviews, I was expecting the worst. However, with the exception of the scence at the dinner, this book kept my interest and was a refreshing change. Kellerman is one of my favorite authors, but I do have to admit his last few Delaware books were a little bogged down with his romantic life."
3,Not his usual...,"I stumbled into an Alex Delaware novel long ago and was completely taken in. A long time after THAT, I discovered that there were more novels written about this same character and I quickly became a fan of Mr. Kellerman's books. I bought The Conspiracy Club hoping it was of the same standards as the Alex Delaware novels.I was disappointed. This book seems like a rush job, with things going on all over the place and no clear path to anything. I'm all for new characters and new novels, but I had expected this book would be as good as his previous ones...those I can't put down! This one's hard to pick up!"
3,Wait for the paperback,"There is no such thing as a bad Jonathan Kellerman novel, but some are better than others. This standalone presents a number of problems. The protagonist is a close approximation of Dr. D, but with few of his more attractive traits. Dr. C is too tentative, too young, too soft. The plot is interesting and complex, a nice variant on an old theme, but with no interesting twists and turns. Finally, the setting is fictitious, so we lose some of the texture and local color associated with Kellerman's best work (e.g. BILLY STRAIGHT). Having said that, the narrative is lean, the story interesting, the writing always expert. I didn't devour the book, but I returned to it whenever I got the chance. This would be a top book if Kellerman were not a top talent who always raises our expectations. Read it, but wait for the paperback."
2,Still Disappointed,"I've been a long-time fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have noticed his books steadily declining regarding plot, interest, and entertainment value. I was hoping ""The Conspiracy Club"" would bring him out of the rut he seems to have fallen into, but for me, this book only proves he has run out of motivation or has become bored with writing.I am beginning to wonder when the publishing world will grow tired of continually feeding to the reading world mundane works from formerly best-selling authors (i.e. Cornwell, Patterson, Clancy, Kellerman, et.)and instead focus on more talented, unknown authors. Come on, New York, listen to the readers who are expressing their opinions!"
1,"this is the WORST JK book -- if you are a fan, don't buy it","This is BY FAR the worst Jonathan Kellerman book ever. I have been reading JK for over 10 years and have read almost every book of his. This book moved SO slow and he spent too much time building up characters that were not integral to the plot or at least not the murder mystery plot part. He spent more time building a love relationship between the main character and his girlfriend than he did solving the crime.1 word: BORING! If you are a fan of JK, don't buy this one. It has strayed too far from his main type of storyline."
3,Freddy's back,"From the latest nightmare comes freddy, be careful where you place it as is a little fragil...but looks great and it was made very similar to the real one."
3,Replace every 18 months,"I bought my first DCC-2000 in October 2006. It slowly faded out, with the controls shutting off unpredictably, until one day, it was just dead. I plugged it in and it wouldn't show the clock, nor would it turn on to brew the coffee. I contacted Cuisinart, who replaced it for a $10.00 shipping fee. I assume the replacement was refurbished. It began doing the same thing at about 9 months to a year. I coaxed about 5-6 more months out of it, but now it is sitting on my counter top DEAD. I will contact Cuisinart again, to see if they will replace again. However, I am not thrilled with having to replace this. A coffee pot that costs as much as this one does should last 5-10 years, not 18 months. When it works, it makes EXCELLENT coffee, and I love the feature of pushing the handle and getting hot, perfect, delicious coffee. It even has a gauge (my hubby enjoys that)."
1,Have replaced 3 times...,"Makes great coffee...and then one day it will quit. The brew switch will no longer function. I managed a few weeks of patiently setting the auto brew for the next minute and fooling it into making me coffee on demand this way but obviously it isn't supposed to work this way. I'm on my third unit both had same problem, the brewing on demand electronics are faulty. It is a chronic problem with past units, perhaps I'll get lucky with this one. You would think Cuisinart would recall or halt manufacturing of this model until they can get it right. I cannot recommend until I'm convinced the issue I've described has been corrected. Beware."
2,Great Coffee! Poor Electronics!,"CAVEAT: This coffee maker MUST SET LEVEL, front to back, for gauges to read accurately and all the water to be perked. Use bubble level to check counter surface or set ""Torpedo"" level on the cup grid of coffee maker.That said:This is one great coffee maker! The best I have ever used. Flavor, ease of use, etc. are simply wonderful!8 MONTH FOLLOW UP: Well my wonderful pot cratered like many others here. The clock vanishes, unplug for hour or two, plug back up and you might have a timer clock and you may not. When you do, it will let you finish setting & programming, then it will go BLANK!"
5,"If you want to find or keep a job, you better learn to BRAG","This book is an essential tool for anyone trying to find their way back into today's tough job market. Klaus helps you identify what is intriguing about your strengths and career path and teaches you how to promote yourself in a fun and interesting way. So many of us are unprepared to skillfully speak about our accomplishments that we miss great opportunities right under our nose. We hope that our work will speak for itself or someone else will sing our praises so we won't have to. Don't count on it! Buy this book and learn how to ""do it yourself""."
3,Good on concept/Poor on skill development,"This book reads like a really good magazine article - you get hooked on the concept, but leave wanting more. Author does a great job comparing and contrasting specific examples of how to self-promote and provides a guide to preparing your self-promotion pitch. However, it doesn't articulate a specific framework and set of skills that I can draw upon in any situation. I found it hard to identify the take-aways from chapters that were just rolling examples. Overall, helpful for the guide on preparing your pitch and examples, but fails in developing real skills."
5,COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATOR 2003,"GREAT GAME, TO FLY AND HAVE FUN AND DOGFIGHTING ON THE INTERNET IS GREAT. REALISTIC TO THE TIMEES."
1,Terrible,This was the most boring and pointless book I had ever read. I was forced to read it for English class a year back. The book has no point except that humans keep fighting no matter what. The old man is catching a fish for about 80 of the 127 pages. It's a very bad book that shouldn't have ever been published. I've never read any of Hemingway's other stuff and am not going to any time soon because of the lasting effect of this book.
2,I wish I could have understood it.,I am not sure if I would have liked it because I didn't really understand. I am not interested in the sea or fish. I don't want to criticize it because I didn't understand it but bits & pieces.
3,I absolutley hated this book.,"Ok so in all fairness I am 25 now and I read this in high school at 18, but I detested it so much that I still wont read any of Hemingway's work. It droned on and on and I just couldnt relate, maybe now it would be different but I wont be finding out."
3,Hemingway shows a new side of the sea,"I found this novel exceptionally detailed. The author let you get to know Santiago without writing a complete biography. I especially liked the fact that Hemingway gave a little information about Santiago's previous adventures. The conflict with the sea was a popular subject in the years previous to the writing of this novel. Yet Hemingway introduced his readers to a new side of the sea. Santiago saw the sea as a friend that harbored a brother. The sea gave people food, and was a very peaceful place. This is totally opposite to the sea in Mellville's Moby Dick. Personally I would recomend this book for anyone to read on a rainy day."
3,The Old Man and the Sea was heartwarming and very symbolic!,"The book was very captivating, and it kept you extremely interested. You never know what's going to happpen to the old man next, you hope everything works out, but deep down you know what's in store for Santiago. The young boy in the book shows lots of maturity, which I think was really nice because most young boys are not able to show that level of maturity until a later age. I thought this was a well writen book."
4,a very good book,Again if you like his writing style you will enjoy reading this one...It's a great story about man Vs. the powers of nature
5,A Novella of great depth,What can you say about this book that hasn't been said a thousand times?You could take this novella at face value or you could read as deep into it as the marlin dives and I think you would have an equally good time.Laced with bold imagery and brilliant words this book is one I look forward to reading to my children.
4,Mrs. STEWART... PLEASE READ!,"The Old Man and the Sea HemmingwayPLOT: The conflict is between a fisherman and his self-respect. The climax: Santiago struggling to catch and bring home a fish, teaches Santiago great respect for himself. Santiago is an old Cuban fisherman. He is very poor and he lives a very solitary life. His one friend is a boy who he used to work with. Santiago is both physically and mentally strong. He is old but very smart. He lives his life alone and learns a lot about himself, and triumph on this fishing trip.The theme of this book is that you can still win in the face of tragedy. I thought this was a good book. But it was short. It is very well written! I enjoyed reading this book and would certainly recommend it to a friend."
5,Six stars if I could,"I read it as a kid in school, and re-read it many years later, and now recently a third time. The book just keeps getting better. Each of your own life's successes and failures, proud moments and shameful moments only enrich your next reading of the book, and I can't wait to see how good it will be when I read it the fourth time."
1,"Yet Another So Called ""Classic"" Overrated Alcoholic Writer!!!",In this book we see the struggle of a fisherman against a big marlin fish. Many reknown Literary Critics have suggested that this was a metaphor for Hemingway's own battle with Depression and Alcoholism. Most biographers of Hemingway have also suggested that his drinking excesses exacerbated his Depression which is why his books are often of differing quality. Sadly Hemingway shot almost every living animal on this planet until the only thing left to shoot was himself. No doubt had he lived he would have enrolled in a Twelve Step Programme (that's the correct Australian spelling of that word by the way) for alcoholics and 28 days in Rehab just like his Grandaughter the beautiful but highly unstable Margaux Hemingway.
3,The True person Inside Review By Jared Street,"Santagio was an old man with a dream. He wanted to please his one and only friend and disdciple Manolin. Hemingway showed that if you ignore the pains of society you would always prevail no matter how bad your life is. Santiago went out to sea to fish and he only came back with only a skeleton. Santagio fished for many day and only came back with the shell of his prize, but knew in his heart that he was an all around winner. The moral of the story is that if you think you are a winner in your mind you are a winner no matter who you are and what you have done."
4,Exceeded expectations,"I was very interested in, what on the surface sounds like a plain story, that I finished it in one day. Typically I am a slow reader, so finishing anything in one day is rare for me.I liked the clear and concise details and descriptions. Just enough to let the reader imagine the scene without belaboring the story.The story itself had me wondering what would come next for Santiago and how he would handle it."
4,The Old Man and the Sea,"I had never read this classic. As has been well documented, Hemingway had a gift. His descriptions of the action in this book allows you to envision the fish, the sea and the old man."
4,Great Book!,Paved the way for great reading. I really enjoyed this book and all the books of Ernest Hemmingway. Recommend Highly!
2,HMMMMM.....,"I couldn't finish the book coz it was soooooo slow. Sutherland attempts to use exclamations and such but it is just monotonously(?) written. I get the idea behind it and all but can't understand why this is THE book for Hemingway. Ah, but I got through it."
3,Worth the time,"This book is a very short story and I think it is worth reading for the time it takes. If this was a very long story I would say skip this book and find something more interesting. There are deep meanings in this book and it takes thinking to figure them out. Overall, I recommened reading this book to anyone who wants a short story that makes you think."
3,The Old Man and the Sea,"In this story the main character is Santiago, an old Cuban fisherman, who tries to catch the 1500 pound marlin. While you are with Santiago you will explore his fate, courage and how he is harmony with nature. Actully I didn't like this book much because I like more exciting books. Books that could stop my heart for a second, make sweat on my hand or surround my mind with saddness and pain, books like mysteries or dectective books. This book was really not my style. However there was one part that I liked in the book. This was when the fish jumped out of the water and the author decribed it in great detail. I would not recomend this book to a person who likes adventures, or mysteries because I know that they won't like it much."
2,The old Man Who Abuses the Sea,An old man goes out to sea and beats and abuses and kills all these different sea creatures for days... What a masterpiece!!! I wanted the old [...] to fall out of the boat and get eaten by sharks...
2,the old man and the sea,i had to read this book as a summer reading requirement.it was a quick read but it could have defenitly been shortened a bit.
2,This book was boring to me,This book was boring because it said the same thing over and over. This book was about a old man Telling a story about a fish and nobody believed him and one day he cautch the fish he was telling everbody about and by the time he got to land he had nothing but bones.
5,A Great Book,"Even though I am only in middle school, I have read this book. Although I could not possibly understand all of the hidden meanings that Hemingway had put in, I loved the way the book was simple. The sentences were simple and you could understand what was happening easily! I plan to read this again in the future, and maybe next time, I'll have a better understanding of it."
2,Boring,I being a 14 year old girl found this book very boring because it is about a fisherman catching a big fish. It also had no chapters so it just kept going on and on.
5,Love it!,"I love my book! Thankyou for sending it in great condition, and making sure it got to my house promptly. God bless you!"
3,This book was about a three.,"The reason that I gave this book three stars was because it was a good writing. It had good descriptions and good details. Overall I did not enjoy the book very much, because basically throughout the whole book it talked about a man catching a fish. I liked the way the author made the story a little more interesting, the way he explained the old man being there for three days and all the details he had in that section. The thing I didn't really like was that the story kept dragging on and on about the same thing. That is why I gave the book a three because there were some good points and some bad points."
4,Hemmingway in a slightly more thoughtful register,"I'm not a big Hemingway fan, but I actually enjoyed this because his usual bland machismo is tempered here by a sense of reflection and, at times melancholy. It's pretty heavy handed (oh, the futility of old age!) but it's also just more thoughtful than the other books of his I've read, the prose a bit more pensive. At the same time, its still Hemingway and it has a very boisterous, adventurous quality to it. It's just fun to be out on the sea on a beautiful day, even if mother nature does give you that final, romantic smack down. The writing has an almost technical feeling at times, especially the beautiful descriptions of fish and sharks."
3,Man Overboard,I like the way that the old man entertained himself on the boat but it might have been more interesting if had sung showtunes and worn stilletto heels.
3,The Old Man & The Sea,"Ernest Hemingway certainly knows how to write a tight, concise narrative novel with his Pulitzer Prize winning novel ""The Old Man & The Sea"". This is what makes ""The Old Man & The Sea"" a great novel.There seems to be quite a bit of religious inference going on inside this novel too. Sin is touched upon. The old man struggles to catch the fish (only to have a sad ending in the novel) and there are other scenes that eludes to the crucifixion of Christ.I enjoyed reading this classic novel... But wouldn't rank Hemingway's writing style as one of my favorites."
4,Bananarama at their best,"This was the 'Rams transformational period, going from the production teams of Swain and Jolley to the Stock, Aitken, Waterman stable. This album contains contributions from both.Although S.A.W. provide the 'Rams with the hit (Venus, which is the one the girls will always be remembered for), it is Swain and Jolley who inevitabley steal the album, with a collection of songs about life, but with a pop edge.I have all of the albums the girls have released in Britain and this cerainly stands out as the best. Gone are the girls weeknesses and insecurities. This album brims with confidence. Even though it was recorded in the mid-eighties, it can easily be listened to over and over again with the enjoyment it provided originally."
4,My son oves this show,"Originally, we thought this was a Mickey Mouse clubhouse movie but it is 2 episodes of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse show. One episode is extended length (approx. 45 min.). My son watches the DVD over and over again. Please be aware that these episodes are not original to the DVD as they have been aired a few times on the Disney channel."
4,Nice toy,"Purchased as Christmas gift for 2 1/2 year-old. He was very excited to open the toy and has played with it quite a bit. A simple toy, but lots of opportunity for imaginative play with the Tootles cards."
1,Too Small for the Nikon CoolPix 4300,"The quality of the camera case is adequate. However, it is simply too small to fit the Nikon CoolPix 4300. I must actually force the camera into the case. I think instead of making a case to fit this camera, Nikon simply adopted the case used for the CoolPix 2000. Too bad the case isn't in the same league as the camera - which is fantastic. I'm now shopping for a slightly larger case to protect my investment."
2,There are better options.,"I suppose that if you were to read this book and follow it's instructions, you could likely produce a decent enough wine. However, if you really want a proper education on the subject, look elsewhere. Some might argue that this is merely a ""starting point"", but I'd rather not have the rudiments glazed over. Check out ""The way to make wine"" if you are considering making wine from grapes or pressed juice. I have only just started it, but it is a much more informative, well written book."
5,the perfect audio work bag.,"i am not an adventurer, i am not a student, i am a stagehand and i believe that this is the perfect bag for the audio/lighting tech. i am able to hold all of my essential tech tools (crescent wrench, led light, multi-tool, headset, board tape, bag of various connectors and barrels) as well as a few testers (q-box, nl4/nl8 tester, voltpen, 12-3 tester). my phone fits nicely in the strap pouch and i keep various sharpie's, pen's, gum, and my key's in the mesh pouch. this bag is awesome!!! it's not too big or small and it looks good. this bag is a/v chic at its' finest!!!!!!"
3,Handy roadcut rock guide -- but could be much more specific,"Alt and Hyndman provide an interesting summary of rock types encountered on a good variety of Northern CA highways. In plain language, they partially unravel the complicated, contorted geology of northern CA as seen through the roadcuts and park drives. This book's biggest deficiency, compared to others in the Roadside Geology series, is its failure to provide specific names and formation periods for many roadside rock layers mentioned, especially in the Sierras, Klamaths and Modoc Plateau. This info is a valuable time-saver for an amateur rockhound. For numerous excellent examples of the naming and dating I am talking about, read Roadside Geology of Texas by Darwin Spearing. Despite this important flaw (for the rockhound who catalogs his specimens), I recommend this book for anyone interested in geology who will be travelling across northern CA."
4,Heartwarmingly good,"The story itself was compelling. It was sad, but you wanted to keep reading just to see what would happen. The ending was predictable. It did bring out some emotion in me and kept my interest, so I would recommend this book, the story is good, just need to look past the writing at times. DS did repeat herself many times through out the book."
4,Johnny Angel,"When I first began reading this book I was somewhat disappointed... it didn't lure me in like her other books, The Promise or Once in a Lifetime. However, I continued to read- and sure enough, by chapter 10, I was in tears! In fact, I didn't stop crying! The ending was absolutely beautiful!"
4,Sad but comforting.,"This mini-book left me wishing the angel theory could possibly exist. How many times have we wished we could see a loved one, just one more time?This is not a ""fun"" book, it is a sad story with hope for the future for any person, or family who might go through this horrible ordeal.I did not like the fact that the father in the story seem to be back in the 19th century regarding girls in sports.I also was tired of the repitition in parts of the story.Even with some reservation, this is a good book. It makes you feel good when you are done. Life does go on, even though we think it never will."
3,Well crafted but overproduced,"Hysteria is what everyone references Def Leppard to. I cant disagree that it is a one of the best rock albums of all time. The title track 'Hysteria' is one of the few songs that i think still holds up today. The others were over killed on radio but still well crafted songs with great hooks. My only complaint with Hysteria is that the production really kills the feel of the songs. If you caught Leppard on there 'Slang' tour in 96' you really could hear the songs the way they should have been recorded, stripped down and they really had feeling. Great album nonetheless, but i would rather listen to the alternative Def Leppard and listen to Slang."
3,good cd,This is just a CD version of the album. It is not re mastered and sounds muffled compared to digitally master or re mastered CDs. Yes CD came to me within a timely manner and I was pleased with my purchase.
5,Def Leppard's Best Album,"I've been a Def Leppard fan since their ""Pyromania"" album was released in 1983, but they've one-upped themselves with ""Hysteria. This is by far their best album. Every song on the disc is great, and there are five songs, ""Rocket"", ""Animal"", ""Love Bites"", ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"", and the title track, that went on to be major hits for the band.Led by Joe Elliot's great lead vocals, Def Leppard delivers a hard-driving style of rock and roll that the listener won't soon forget. It is remarkable that Def Leppard's drummer only has one arm, because you would never know it by listening to the great drum solos on each song.I highly recommend this great cd. Listen to ""Hysteria"" and hear the absolute best from Def Leppard."
1,One Arm away from no stars...,"If you like over produced, slick MTV hair metalpop with band members who have strategically placed tears in their jeans this is for you. Me? I'll listen to Jane's Addiction's ""Nothing Shocking"" instead."
4,An absolute classic.,"It's true that this album wasn't as ""metal"" as those before it, but that didn't stop it from being their best and most popular album. I like the early stuff too, right back to ""On Through The Night"", but this is easily tops. Half of this disc is pretty much singles, hence six of these songs are on their ""Greatest Hits"" album. Included is ""Women"", ""Animal"", ""Love Bites"", and the still often heard ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"". One of my favorite tracks by far, which never seems to be mentioned by anyone, is ""Gods Of War"". That song is awesome. Only a few albums from this genre are close to being this great, those are ""5150"", ""Dr. Feelgood"", and ""Appetite For Destruction"". All of them should make you ""Def""."
1,awful!,i cannot describe how much i hate this album and this band! this is one of the most commercial albums ever made! this is for the girls only!
4,"I have been searching forever for ''LOVE BITES""","I can really relate to some of Def Leporeds songs especially ""Love Bites""It brings out the true feelings of life and its daily happenings.I really do enjoy this song."
4,Def Leppard on Viagra,"Here is your turning point. Anything before this is Rock'n Roll. I can't guarantee any of the listeners will like the previous sound, and the same for the true fans. It was a good band just trying to re-invent themselves like The Metallica gone bad. The Beatles found India. Def Leppard just all died out. Ashes to ashes and dust to dust life is short so party we must. Their sound died with the old members. But it is still 4 stars."
4,Red Fox Was Better,"I think his best effort has been Red Fox, that book is truly a five. This good is a close second but does not have the tension and great mystery that Red Fox had. This author writes tight, slick books that keep you interested through out. This is an interesting book that combines espionage with a murder mystery. You are never in need of additional details with this author, he really fills the pages up, and for some I think this can be too much. This really is a book that has two - three very well developed and written plot twists that makes you stay on your toes. I have reread the book and it is something how well he places the road signs. This is a great book; unfortunately he was not able to keep up this form into his next."
5,The Best Children's Movie of all time's MUSIC!,Follow that Bird's soundtrack has a great narration of the movie mixed in with the fantastic songs. A MUST BUY for any Sesame Street fan!
3,Good against odds,"This is a chopped-up version of the film aimed at the American market. Some of the chopping is pretty obvious. I would have preferred the original Italian version, which appears to have vanished from the face of the earth. On the up side, it's a great old movie with great performances that I wanted to own, and now I do."
2,Not that great,"My mother-in-law cracks on me every time I wear this hat! The style is not that appealing I must say. It is warm, but ugly."
3,It's alright,"I like the beanie itself.. I just didn't get what I expected. I was hoping for a pure white beanie but the color seems a bit.. off. The color seemed like someone's been wearing for a couple of years and the white jus wore off.The shipping was incredibly fast.The size of the beanie is small but since I have a small head, it's good.But this isn't what I wanted.."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!,Ordered items Dec 3 for xmas presents & DID NOT get items until Dec 26. Package came and WAS SENT THE WRONG ITEMS ORDERED. Did not match what was on the picture. Called them but took forever to get any answer. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! CANNOT RESOLVE PROBLEMS QUICKLY.
1,Leaves residue. A LOT of it.,"I've had this tape for a while and it's the bane of my existence. Every time I pull it out of my gear closet, it leaves residue where it was laying, just from the excess stickyness on the side of the tape.Don't bother with it. If you tape anything down with this, its going to leave a streak of glue when you pull it up. I picked up a roll of gaffers tape PRECISELY so this wouldn't happen."
2,Disappointing - need to use scissors to cut it.,"As I DJ, I use gaffers tape to prevent people from tripping over my wires and to keep wires out of sight. This tape was functional, but it was very difficult to rip by hand and too sticky. It pulled off the roll laboriously. When I tried it rip it, the tape stuck together to other sticky parts and functioned nor looked good. I couldn't even cut this tape with my teeth. Very frustrating for something that SHOULD take a few seconds to execute.If you like carrying around a pair of scissors to cut your gaffe tape, then fine. However, I discontinued using it and bought a different brand that comes off the role smoothly and rips easily by hand."
2,Crash,"This is a middling role-playing game. The plot was OK and it was holding my interest. The game ran too slow on my 3-year old XP machine. It ran OK on my new Vista machine, but got buggier as I got further into the game. I finally had to give up, because the final quest crashed both computers. There are better games out there."
2,"Hope they stop at 3-not a 4th sequel, please!!!!","This movie is a complete waste of time --bad acting, very predictable plot-The original Wild Things was pretty good and it went downhill from there. If you just like to look at hot babes then you might be able to sit thru it-but the babes in here are really stupid-they act stupid and the script is pretty lame. Does this really happen? A real waste of 90 minutes--avoid it except if you turn the sound off and look at the chicks."
3,A Good Weekend Read,"I enjoyed the novel Pompeii very much but I wouldn't consider it a great book. Some parts of it dragged but, there were many interesting scenes. I was very interested in the Augusta Adequate and the dailey life of the Romans. There were a few surprizes. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy historical fiction. Someone in my book discussion group wants us to read this but, I feel that although it's entertaining , there's not much to discuss."
5,Pompeii,This book was fascinating from the first word. How to build an aquaduct was never one of my prime learning goals but it never occurred to me how much scientific knowledge was needed for such an endeavor. That such knowledge existed in those early A.D. years is astounding and the author makes every bit of learning a wow experience. At least for me. Sad that such a civilization should fall to greed and mismanagement. But then most civilizations seem to.
4,"Recommended for lovers of water, volcanoes, or the Roman Empire","'Pompeii' is a highly readable historical mystery set in Roman Pompeii in 79 C.E. just before the 'you know what' happens. Robert Harris has an eye for historical detail and can spin a good yarn. The reader of Pompeii learns a bit about Roman aqueducts, the Roman empire and, of course, volcanoes.The protagonist, Marcus Attilius Primus, is the new 'aquarius' sent out from Rome to take over the care and maintenance of the Aqua Augusta, the immense aqueduct that served the Bay of Naples area. Figure out just what did happen to the former aquarius, why the water has dried up, and how did a former slave become the (apparently) richest, most powerful man in Pompeii. Meet Pliny the Elder along the way.A fun read. Highly recommended for lovers of water, volcanoes, and the Roman Empire."
3,Pompeii by Robert Harris,"A bit too ""crude 21st century"" wordage, but interesting in concept. I love a good ending too! It was a bookclub selection."
1,Too dry.,"I liked the way it starts out painting a picture of Ancient Rome that is visually. But the characters soon turned dry.Especially because the main voice was a an Architect who had a very modern feel to him.Much like Michael Chricton's ""Eaters of the dead,"" It lacked an Ancient point of view."
2,pompeii,"If you are expecting a well-crafted, literary historical novel (regarding the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in ancient Greece), you will be disappointed. this book seems to have been designed for a mass audience. the plot of this book is not very imaginative or interesting and the prose is annoyingly slick. Finally, there is neither much detail regarding the history of ancient greece nor to volcanology, either of which might have provided more redeeming value for this book."
1,pompei,"Pompei, by Robert Harris, is terrible. It is written in a childish style like you used to get in the Weekly Reader in third grade. The plot is lighter that pumice. Do you think our hero, Attilius, will live through the eruption, go back to Pompei and find the girl? Do you think Exomnius was on the take and Ampliatus is behind it all? As soon as you meet these characters it is clear what is going to happen the writing is so bad. I was hoping that our hero would have to solve some intricate math in roman numerals, like in the Da Vinci Code, to add some interest. Don't buy this in hard cover, wait for the comic book. Even Russell Crowe would turn down this movie, the plot it is so dumb."
3,Beach read.... and it is fun!,"This is fun, fast read. a good story, very visual, and shall I dare say ""beach"" read. (Although I read it on the airplane.) Fun and it is a page-turner. I picked it up because later this year we plan to visit Pompeii and I thought it would be a fun way to get introduced to the site. This is not much of an historical novel, but interesting the way Harris weaves the story around the various Roman cities.I liked it a lot better than Night Fall the last ""thriller"" I read."
2,Not very good.,"I enjoyed Harris' ""Fatherland"", but I'm afraid I can't recommend ""Pompeii"". The plot was linear and predictable and the one-dimensional characters were just not very interesting. For a historical novel I expected more insights into Roman thought and culture, but those aspects of the book were pretty superficial.It's not a horrible book, but it's just fluff. Fuff with a touch of history, but fluff nonetheless. I expected better."
2,it sucks the life out of the doomed city Pompeii,"its ok, but it gives you to much information to soon, i mean the city of Pompeii is thrilling and so is teh thought of how the people must have felt about it, but this information filled book sucked teh life out of the doomed city, personally i think he could have done much better and his past books support that. I wish he couldve made some of the information just disapear then maybe it couldve made a better turn-out. I was throughly disapointed."
2,"Simple plot, simple book","I cannot say I liked this book. It had its moments, but they were few and far between. Basically the plot is about an Aquarius(A guy who manges the aqueducts of Rome) and a Volcano with a little romance mixed in. Very boring indeed.Premise: The entire story is about the aquarius and his quest to go to Pompeii to fix the aqueduct. Along the way he makes enemies, you don't really know why. He meets a girl, who he likes, but she comes and goes in passing. You meet one really bad guy, but he doesn't come across as really that bad. The main character instead comes off as a panzy woose.There is poor writing and very poor characterization. Each character is briefly described if at all. The ending comes off very fast, and not properly dealt with. In the last 1/8 of the book the mountain explodes, a round about rescue is performed, the bad guys dies and the girl rescued, the end.Avoid this book if possible."
5,Chinatown Rex,"This seemed less a historical novel to me than a rather scathing critique of our own times. At the end Harris even makes some strange and cryptic comments on the goings-on of these days, including an odd thought about ""global warming."" (no, not at all the predictable global warming comment). If it is all a metaphor for the current Zeitgeist then what Harris has to say may not make a lot of people happy.The favorable straight-up reviews are solid and those seeking a fast-paced and well-written historical novel should grab this. However, if you're the sort who likes books that may be more than what they seem (you know who you are) then i think you'll like this a lot."
4,A short book about a long journey,"I enjoy reading almost anything about antique autos,the early days of the US auto industry, old car trips and stories about the history of early automobile travel in the United States. This is a wonderful companion to the PBS series video on the first successful United States transcontinental auto trip from California to NYC. Great olde tyme photos and a well presented memoir of the adventure. Of course you cannot ""just"" read the book...the video is a must!"
4,"MISSING EXTENDED "" I CAN'T HELP IT""","There was an extended version of ""I Can't Help It"" out back in late 1987-mid 1988 but this cd doesn't include it and instead has extended remixes that weren't heard.These girls were the best dance artists of the 1980s and made great music."
1,Ironing Board,We were very disappointed with how unstable this ironing board turned out to be. We have been unable to find a better one that will fit into the same area.
5,Correction,To the previous reviewer: Mr Giddens was RIGHT. Coltrane's Impressions was based on BOTH pieces of music.
3,Satisfied?,"Overall, I was satisfied with this book. It gives some useful, if not practical tips and suggestions on being under the covers with a woman. Nothing earthshattering or too enlightening here though. If you are looking for insight, check out How to Give Her Pleasure OR The Romantic's Guide by Michael Webb."
5,Most outstanding sermon ever preached,Jonathan Edwards succinctly tells the gospel facts and even though the sermon is 300 years old they are still valid today.
5,AWESOME! These Speakers ROCK!,"For less than 200 dollars for the pair..this is an incredible deal. I just received mine yesterday and I LOVE THEM. GIVE KLH the credit..Great Sound, Great Price. They have my recommendation."
3,Semi-licious,"Overall, it's a good tasting bar with staying power for my most intense workouts. However, I prefer the other ProteinPlus flavors--they've got a thicker chocolate coating and are soft rather than tough to chew (regardless of how fresh)."
4,Yum,"Good nutrition, and they taste so good my toddlers actually want bites of them. Repeatedly. Can't say that of any of the other protein bars I've tried."
2,Good but BAD SHIPPING,The bars were OK I guess. The packaging was not the best and all of the bars melted into one pile of gooey mess. I would not order from here again.
2,Gross.,"I like all kinds of Power Bars, Balance bars, Odwalla, Premier Bars. Just don't like the taste of Chocolate Chocolate Chunk."
2,Love these bars but...,"I love the flavor of these bars but the three boxes I received were not fresh. In fact, most of the bars had white on the chocolate in places. The bars were not soft. I was disappointed."
5,Great Supplemental Protein Source!,"I really do enjoy this product. One of the best protein bars that I have tasted. Not overly sweet, and the chocolate taste is very rich. These bars are also very filling so you wont get the urge to be snacking right after you eat one. Mine arrived a little melted, but its summer so that is to be expected when a package is sitting on my porch all day. Overall, great product by Met-Rx."
1,"Stale product, very disappointing","Ordered two boxes of this, along with another box of peanut crisp, as we normally get this from the Vitamin Shoppe. This was slightly cheaper, well guess now I know why, the product was stale! Almost chipped a tooth eating the bar. So guess we are going back to the Vitamin shoppe."
5,Awesome CD Player!,"I got this discman a few days ago and it is great! It has a battery life of 20 hours with ESP2 off. I usually walk around with ESP off and it only skips if I am going down the stairs or if I am walking up or down a slope. It is very compact and looks nice. Sound quality is very good. It has Mega Bass and Groove modes. Keep in mind that there are two colors for this discman (silver and blue). I was expecting a silver one like the picture but I got the blue instead. To me, both colors look good. The discman is light weight and thin."
4,good exept for 1 thing,I love the shock protection.I used to own a 30dollar GPX cd player and it broke fast and ate too many batteries(dontt even make me think about the headphones).The headphones for this one suck but i already had some nice headphones so it was a good buy.END
2,Not impressed,"I had to read this book for a literature class. I found the book at my local library in the teen section. The story is creative and interesting but the editor did a very poor job on this book. It was really more annoying to read than anything because I felt like I should be editing the book as I read. There were long, over descriptive sentances that I had to go back and read over again to understand. There were even sentances in the book that made no sense at all; Just a bunch of words put together. It's really frustrating to have to read such a poorly written book and it's sad because the story could have been really good."
3,"A good novel, but not Le Guin's best","The Eye of the Heron chronicles the inhabitants of the planet Victoria, originally a prison colony of Earth. However, 'The People of Peace,' who led a non-violent movement against the great wars of Earth, were also sent to the planet be the government of a great nation. When the novel begins, the people of the prison colony enjoy great comforts in town, disdaining the People of Peace, who do their farming.Those who live outside the city grow tired of this poor exchange, and want to go found a new city, with no oppression. The novel explores the struggle to do this, as the non-violent people question their own ideals.This book has beautiful moments, and the characters are well-conceived. However, it lacks the depth of some of Le Guin's other novels like The Dispossesd and The Left Hand of Darkness. It is an enjoyable read, but in the end it is lighthearted rather than than deep and pondering."
3,tough love for mike,"ITJ is a product of its time but to be a noir classic this story has not aged so well. If you're willing to dismiss a short list of glaring imperfections, mike is still a fun read and surely one tough dude."
1,Text missing between p58 and 59,"I had to buy this book under duress (one of those lecturer/author situations at uni), and was very disappointed to find that there is text and bullet points missing - the pages are in the right order 58,59,etc. But the bottom of p58 does not correspond with the top of p59. Crap printing as well. Look elsewhere if you have to buy this book."
1,Nothing but Feminazi Rage,"I'm getting married next year, and I've read alot of books related to marriage and planning weddings, and this was the worst waste of them all. The author spends the whole book ranting about what 'our' mothers did wrong and how modern women should all be bit- I mean witches like her. She never talks about finding what's right for yourself, you either worship Norwood, or you belong in your mothers generation and are doomed to pain misery. In Norwood's world their seems to be no possibility of compromise, it's his way or hers. She blames the disruption of the '50s family on 'his way' and praises 'her way' as the path to success. Total self-centered spoiled princess BS. This woman is an conceited idiot, and this book is a waste of time and money."
2,It's too hard,"Unless you enjoy working hard at reading novels, I don't recommend this book. Before you start take a look at the 411 notes in the back that you will have to study (unless you know already know) to get something out of this work."
2,doesn't work,"I bought this book for my kindle touch but it won't download! I really wanted to read it because it sounded interesting. Sincerely , Your Would Have Been Customer"
3,"A Classic, But . . .","This novel is well-written and an example of good literature, with an interesting plot and an even more interesting list of characters. Its drawback is that it is an inherently and unabashedly imperialistic book, and India (and Indians) are ultimately quite negatively portrayed and stereotyped. Call it a classic, but imperialism is imperialism. And somehow the story of a little British boy ""triumphing"" over India doesn't do it for me."
2,arg,"OK to start I was completely board through what I read of KIM. Dont be fooled most people who come on to write reviews are history majors and like anything that is historical. Let me tell you that for a normal person KIM will not be all that interesting! I will give Kipling credit for spending much of his life in India, this is apparent in the novel where he shows a vast understanding of the culture but again if you are not a history buff this is not a book for you."
4,boy without a cross,"A brief, gorgeous and kaleidoscopic picture of the ""great game"" in northern India. Interesting to read at the moment that India and Pakistan were engaging in the same great game on the same soil, with Pakistanis hijacking an Indian place to Afghanistan.Mom was wrong, I think, to treat Kim's whiteness as a minor betrayal by Kipling of his material -- a retreat from the more wholly Indian story he wanted to write. The whiteness is central to Kim -- Kim is like Leatherstocking a ""man without a cross."""
2,The first 100 pages,"I must admit I didn't make it through 100 pages. I had good intentions, made it through the first 40 or so, then promised that I would pick up again 'later.' It's now been a couple of weeks and I've made every excuse that I could think of, before realizing that it's not you -- it's me. So I must with reluctance (but relief) consign this book to the box in the basement marked ""goodwill."""
2,Not one of the better books,I was very disappointed in this book. I felt I had to finish it because SOMETHING had to happen to make it worth reading. It never did. After a while I didn't even care what happened to the characters. Hope the next one is better.
4,Classic James.,"I am a crime novel addict. James is one of my favorite authors, and this is a typical James' novel. Dalgliesh is true to form. Setting is nicely upper- middle class with all the necessary sibling rivalry, disappointed employees, disgruntled gardners etc. No surprises, but a good read."
4,"When in doubt, return to Dalgleish!","P.D. James doesn't write cutting edge thrillers like she used to (she's in her mid-80s for heaven's sake...even Agatha Christie got tired eventually), but she still has her grip firmly on the heart and mind of the inimitable, desirable Commander Dalgleish. The crimes in question take place relative to the ""Murder Room"" at an obscure little museum on the outskirts of London. I wasn't transported by the story, which involves murders staged to resemble those in the Murder Room, but I sure did like a chance to be in and around the mind of Dalgleish the Poet once again. I loved dear old Tally, the solitary caretaker, and wished with all my heart that someone would pay attention to her. Alas, this is not a dynamic book, but it is a good, fairly quick read for a nice weekend afternoon. And Lady James sure seems to know a lot about naughty things for a nice old grandmother!"
4,Great entertainment for adults,I think my husband and I played with this more than the kids. They did like the noise that is made.
2,Beautiful piece of equipment...,"I took this on my Mexico vacation and for the first day(2 dives)and it worked fantastic. The pictures turned out far better than I could have imagined. But, on the first dive the second day it started to leak at 45 feet and destroyed the camera. Fortunately most of the pics were rescued. I have no idea why it failed as I followed all the instructions to the letter. I sent my camera and case back to Canon and they said they would repair both at no cost. We'll see what happens."
5,Be Mighty,Freak the mighty is a book about two boys who are diffrent from everyone else and how they form a friendship. Each one has a quality the other needs and together they become something incredible. This unlikely friendship begins by Maxwell getting a paper bird out of a tree for Freak.This book is exciting and emotionally moving at the same time. Everyone who reads it will be able to relate to the feeling of being different. This book rminds us we are all very similar. I loved this book.
4,review of the mighty,Ithink the mighty was a great succes. It could have used a little more detial about kevin's father. I think the mighty would be great for other people to watch. the movie didn't tell much of kevin's pastand how he got the decease. I think the movie could have been a little longer than usual. the mighty was a mix of emotions. this movie teaches us that we can do any thing we put our mind to and if we try hard enough we can succeed. than you for listening to me
2,Only A Bit Like The Book,"I watched this in reading class after reading Freak The Mighty. The movie cut out many important details from the book and made worse scenes to put in their place. If you read the book, you will notice that the movie doesn't resemble it very much and the book is so much better."
5,Pleased,"I am very pleased with this DVD. What a good movie. My students were reading the book, so we all voted to view the movie after reading the book. Everyone loved it."
5,The Mighty,"""The Mighty"" was a very good movie that could make you laugh and cry at the same time. It makes you realize how to make and grow your relationship with your friends. The friendship between Max and Freak makes us realize that both of them would go to any length to help each other. We gave it 5 stars to show that the directors and the actors did a really good job at showing how a friendship should turn out. A good example of what a friendship should turn out be is when the boys, the bullies who picked on Max and Freak, put Loretta's purse down the sewer. Max and Freak went to get Loretta's purse out of the sewer and had returned it back to her. In the event of them retrieving the purse the bullies had shown up and had threatened to hurt Max and Freak, but both of them worked together to scare off the bullies. This was our favorite movie because even though it seemed they don't like each other they continue to grow in their friendship."
5,Wonderful and Heartwarming,Now this is the type of movie all young children should read. And maybe a few of us adults as well.
4,A Sweet Film,"As of this writing, there are 108 reviews for this film, detailing the plot, the cast, and the plot. I'm not going to repeat any of that.I'm just going to say that this film was very enjoyable to watch, and certainly worth an evening. This is more than a message film, that the least of us have worth, that good can triumph over evil, that one person's shortcomings can be filled by another's strength.The Mighty is all of that, but it is entertaining as well. There are life lessons to be learned here, for sure, but the inventiveness and imagination of Kevin, the disabled boy, brings a touch of whimsy and light humor to the film that might be unexpected.It may not follow the book (which I have not read) closely, but it stands on its own as a sweet film that doesn't lay a message on too heavily, but, with the help of an excellent cast, strikes just the right balance between humor, drama, and pathos.Recommended."
3,I want to tell you how I feel about this movie.,"When my teacher told my class that we were going to watch this movie I was like, Great, This is going to ruin the book. I really think it ruined the movie very much because of all the things they changed from the book. It wasn't a bad movie it was just I didn't like all the things they changed. If they wouln't have changed so much stuff, I think it would have been a hell of a better movie. I think it was pretty stupid putting it out at a different time instead of putting it out when it was suppost to."
5,Great book,This book goes into graet detail on the the pros and cons of differetn years and models. It really helped me in selecting a plane for purchase.
4,Khalila wa Dimna,"I also have an older (pre-CD) version of this book (to be honest, I like mine better, the illustrations in the later version are silly and I like having a hardcover book). The stories are a great aid and motivator to learning to read Arabic, as of course, you want to know how the stories turn out, and they all have a sort of lesson to impart. I wish I could find more books like this, for beginning students. One can read the stories and not be overwhelmed, and get a taste of something outside of the modern 'textbook'."
3,incomplete,"Where is Judy Garland's ""The Man That Got Away"" It was a hit, also nominated for an oscar."
2,"An important book, a questionable translator.","_State and Revolution_ is a complicated book in the annals of Marxist thinking. Lenin assigns above all a class role to the State, and therefore ascertains correctly the necessity of a socialist state assuming a proletarian viewpoint. At the same time, Lenin's socialist state lacks a truly political dimension, as it remains, above all, a means for strictly administrative decision-making. Something that would gravely hamper the subsequent understanding of the political character of a future socialist state, specially when you think that this book was written while Lenin hid from the Kerensky government, that's to say just before the October Revolution. Neverthless, the problems put by the book have enormous present value. Therefore it must be taken as entirely questionable the decision to choose as translator an anti-communist like Service, something that would be quite like choosing a neo-stalinist to translate Trotsky's ""Revolution Betrayed""."
4,Where in the World and USA is Carmen San Diego?,"I played this game years ago, and it is better than I remember. I hope all of you enjoy this game if you get it!!!"
2,On of the covers is misleading,"I mainly ordered this because of the version of ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego"", only to find out it's not the version I thought it was. I know this is confusing, but there are 3 version of this game: the Classic, a newer version done in 1996 (the one i was hoping to get), and a version done in 2001, also known as Treasures of Knowledge. It's Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego: Treasures of Knowledge that you actually get, which is totally different from the Classic and 1996 version. But at least the USA version is what it should be."
2,World works - USA doesn't - bummer,"it is such a disappointment that the ""Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego"" disk does not work. As stated in other reviews, it appears to install correctly and even goes as far as giving me my first case, and then shuts down with an unknown error. I have had problems with other ""Where in .... is Carmen Sandiego"" games as well, and I don't understand why they can't fix the issue. Bummer."
2,"""Where in the World"" GREAT; ""Where in the USA"" doesn't work","We LOVE the Carmen San Diego games, but have purchased several that seem to install correctly, then don't work at all.The ""Where in the World"" functions perfectly & my kids LOVE this game. It is fun and educational - the best of both worlds.The ""Where in the USA"" sounds great. It seems to install, then when opened, it locks up at the very beginning of the game. We have purchased several Carmen San Diego games & have found that several of the PC products function exactly as this one does, locking up in the initial stages. :("
3,a faulty script,"Jimmy Shergill makes a sincere attempt and strikes a chord. Kabir Sadanand's dialect is jarring, although his performance is sparkling. Farid Amiri is miscast. Kim Sharma has no role. Vinod Nagpal is okay. Mahek sizzles in the item song. Vallabh Vyas [Kabir's father] is functional.On the whole, CHHODON NAA YAAR stands on a faulty script and with no face-value to magnetize cinegoers, it will find the going very tough."
2,Useless,"Are you kidding me, ""if you sent a wrong email go to your colleague's desk open his email and delete your email"" what is this, a joke?This book is so useless and written irresponsibly, cause what if some one really does what he says??? you can be charged with misdemeanor!The only thing I liked about this book is how to escape from the ceiling if you are trapped in a room. That was cool!"
3,Make sure you know which recording is which,"This delightful score has been released twice on CD. The one you will typically see in the store, though, is the recent Varese Sarabande release. It does *not* include most of the confessions, choosing instead to restore the two songs left off the first CD. This detracts considerably from the fun of the album, since those songs are among the weakest of the score and the confessions were highly entertaining."
4,Net,It was exactly as described and worked very well. Keeping all of the leaves out. All are happy. Thank you.
2,Pretty low quality.,Pile is not as deep as the original lexus product. Matting on back of one piece was falling away. Color was as represented.Would not buy this product again.
3,"The ""reality"" is shattered","""The Last Picture Show"" is one of my favorite novels -- and ""Texasville"" is an engaging sequel. The characters were vividly drawn and seemed to occupy a realistic parallel Texas. The appearance of ""Duane's Depressed"" took me by happy surprise because I have been eager to know what became of Duane, Karla, Jacy, and Sonny. As usual, McMurtry writes with heart and insight in the most direct, meaningful prose.But my jaw dropped in disbelief. McMurtry implies that the character Duane Moore has enjoyed the novel and miniseries of ""Lonesome Dove,"" which puts him in the same universe in which ""Last Picture Show"" and ""Texasville"" were written and filmed. So Duane Moore would have to know that he is Larry McMurtry's creation. For me this really undoes the drama -- it is too clever by far and leaves a disappointing footnote to some of the most wonderful characters in contemporary fiction."
2,In a word: disappointing,"I found ""Duane's depressed"" not nearly as good as I had expected. True, the character of Duane is fascinating, and there is a good deal of wonderful humor. However, Duane is never really depressed except in others' eyes, and I found that assignment almost insulting. The fact is that he shows no signs of depression, he is sort of goaded into visiting the psychiatrist, he falls in love with her almost instantly, has a flood of tears and a great understanding far too soon in the doctor-patient relationship, and in general the entire psychological development, from the ""walking"" start to the ""pyramidal"" finish, is written in an all-too sophomorish manner. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had reread ""The last picture show"" or read ""Texasville"". Surely one the story in ""Duane's depressed"" could (and should) have been told in far fewer words."
3,It's okay,"Enjoyed it because it is McMurtry, but not great. Lonesome Dove and The Last picture Show spoiled me for all of his other books"
1,Nothing is 'wrong' with Christian Rock.,I remember this writer from back when I was a kid and my parents & church believed his every word and funny enough this drove me to listen to 'secular' rock & alternative music instead of any form of Christian music.It was only after I got married almost 4 years ago to a Christian woman that I discovered all forms of Christian music including Christian rock and I'm blown away by the impact Christian bands are making at leading more young people to Christ.All you have to do is look up Christian Rock bands like Kutless or The Newsboys or Toby Mac to see how they minister to people at their concerts.Shame on you Jeff Goodwin for leading so many people away from Christ. Books like these are the worse form of legalism and only continue to give Christianity a bad name...
1,"What's wrong with ""What's Wrong with Christian Rock""","The service I received when getting this book was exelent and I got the book for a paper about christian rock, but I completly disagree with Mr. Godwin and I believe that Christian rock can and has been used by God"
3,Scripturally sound review of CCM,"Excellant and scripturally sound expose on Christian Rock. As an ex-rocker prior to salvation, Jeff Godwin perfectly describes my rebellious attitude and motto ""do as thou wilt"" (straight from the Satanic Bible unbeknownst to me). Only a nonbeliever or wordly christian would find offense."
3,OK Speakers,"These are acceptable for the price, but don't expect a room full of bass. And don't try to blast the neighborhood with them, you can't."
4,good,"After looking for a good non stick frypan, I purchased this one. I am using the pan right now and seems to work fine for me. The only thing with the pan is its weight and size. But then the information is already mentioned in the product details, so nothing to crib about. The size works great for cooking a large quantity of food. I am happy with the purchase."
5,great frying pan,I love this pan. It is the perfect size for everything from frying a lb of bacon to making 6 hamburgers. Of course it cleans up wonderfully.
2,CAREFUL!! DVD SINGLE ONLY!!,"Be careful with this one, it's only a DVD single featuring TWO songs. I can hardly call that a good deal, even at $8. Unfortunately, I glanced over the good reviews and ordered it before I realized my mistake."
4,Successful,"I promptly received an e-mail confirming the purchase and as always, experienced the efficiency and detailed information I have come to expect from Amazon. The item was safely packaged (much appreciated) and arrived in great conditon. Keep up the good work, and I will continue to use Amazon.com for shopping when possible."
4,Great Dance CD,"D'Mob are one of the forgotten early dance groups of the 90's. Although, not many people know who the members of the group were, Danny D was the ringmaster and brought along other performers when needed. D'Mob really broke Cathy Dennis and the songs that she is featured on, ""C'Mon and Get My Love"" and ""That's The Way of The World"" are some of the albums best. One thing I noticed about the CD, the version of ""That's The Way of The World"" is different than the cassette single which was released way back when. Another great song is the Stevie Wonder remake ""All I Do."" Check out this CD for a 90's flashback!"
1,Too confusing,"I was attracted to the author's premise for this book, as I have recently been struggling with the conflicting moral perspectives from which colleagues can view the same issue. But I found the book too confusing, and couldn't find compelling support for the author's hypotheses.The book is framed as a Socratic dialogue among characters. Although this style seemed plausible, the characters' personalities were not developed enough for me to distinguish them and identify them with their arguments. Overall, the author's plausible premise was not supported clearly by illustration or research and I remain un-persuaded."
2,alright,this book can be very introspective at times but digging to deep into a subject can get boring after a while. the format could have been better
5,"an excellent, underrated book","This is a superb, underrated book. Ignore the ""sophisticated"" naysayers and read it for yourself. There is, page for page, more insight here than you'll find in almost any work of academic philosophy or sociology on the same subjects. It will, of course, strike you as ""simplistic"" if you're offended by the book's message, its implications, or the unapologetic clarity with which the author defends her thesis. But that's not much of an objection."
1,i didnt get item so i can review,i didnt get item so i wouldnt know how it looks still wanted on the person i bought it from to found me anoter ornament
4,A major Irish talent emerges,"Nice reissue of Shannon's groundbreaking 1991 solo album... As a relative newcomer on the Celtic trad scene, this sweet-toned accordionist/fiddler was in the midst of gigging with singer Christy Moore and the rock-oriented Waterboys when she took some time off to record this nice set of instrumental tunes, along with more dazzling guest stars that you could imagine... The material ranges from traditional reels and such, to bouncy (not-too-poppy) crossover material, and one or two nice surprises of non-Celtic origin. If you like instrumental albums, this one is pretty hard to beat."
5,"A ""JEANNE'S LIST"" SELECTION FOR: PERSONAL GROWTH THROUGH FICTION","Dr. Jeanne Shutes chose this fine book, together with four other excellent works of fiction, to explore around a theme during one of her semesters of Self Awareness through Literature--the longest running book group known (>40 years). If you or your book group/club are interested in knowing the other four works she chose for this theme or are interested in other thematic collections, you will find these listed on the blog, ""Personal Growth through Fiction,"" where her recommendations, chosen from literally hundreds she has read, are offered as a community service for book clubs/groups. All her choices are in paperback and available at Amazon or locally."
2,pictures a too graphic for 3 year old,"We bought this book for our 3 year old who is fascinated with dinosaurs. I was pleased with the illustrations and the easy to follow layout, but when we got to the T-Rex, Xenotarsosaurus and the Yangchuanosaurus, the pictures became too graphic for my son. For example, the T-Rex is carrying what looks to be a severed limb from another animal in it's mouth. I realize that some dinosaurs are meat eaters, but I was hoping this book was a little less explicit. I think this book could be better for an older child."
5,Clever!,I love this book and so do my daughters. I hadn't been able to view the book prior to purchasing and a few other reviews had me weary but I loved the message and the art. Not your typical princess story. No thrown together illustrations. It is a bit longer than I expected but my girls paid very close attention--that's a sign of a great book!Very happy I found a great price on a pre-owned copy to save money and waste! I love Lauren Childs!
3,Badly Packaged,"This item was delivered promptly but not adequately covered in paper before the sticky tape was wrapped to seal the package. Hence, Sticky tape stuck to the book. I was able to delicately remove the tape without tearing the book cover however I literally spent a few hours trying to remove the sticky residue from the book. It still feels tacky & I imagine that it will go yellow in these areas as it gets older.I was disappointed because it is a lovely book."
2,Geared more toward older than younger readers,"This book is the classic tale of the Princess and the Pea, but with illustrations that would delight an older reader more than a child. Very theatrical and interesting, but not what I'd expected for my young granddaughters."
3,Good,"I like this book and my girls seem to. But, I wouldn't put it on the list of our favorite kids books and probably wouldn't miss much if we didn't own it. It is neat in that it is unusal - the graphics are different. The story is a classic. It's so so overall though."
1,SKIP THIS!!!,"This rating is not for the album itself but for the mastering PTG/Vinyl Masterpiece uses. Don't ever buy anything from PTG/Vinyl Masterpiece. Their songs are mastered from vinyl and the songs end abruptly. There is just a nasty chop at the end of every song like they were trying to hide the vinyl rumbling when the song goes off. I bought Atlantic Starr's ""Radiant"" album from PTG thinking it was remastered from the original master tapes. I was so disappointed and felt cheated. Skip this release!"
4,"Soft, warm and thick. They tend to pill a lot.","These are nice socks. Very thick and seem nice and warm. A quality sock, however, they pill a lot after one wash."
4,Adequate,"I purchased this paddle because it matched my requirements. It still doesn't fit in my inflatable-kayak pack, but I've only used it once since I got the paddle. Perhaps I'll find space for it as I use the kayak more frequently."
2,No experience with shorthand? This book is not for you.,"Due to a lack of shorthand classes in my area, I decided to buy this book and teach myself. I read the warnings that this book is not recommended for beginners, but I've taught myself many other skills in the past and figured learning shorthand would be challenging, but possible. When I received the book, I realized that the author assumes you've already read Basic Principles. There are no explanations for what shorthand is, how it originated, or which tools are needed to get started, and I was expecting to see at least a couple of pages covering these topics. I was also disappointed that there are no explanations for any of the material covered in the chapters and that there doesn't seem to be answers for any of the transcription exercises. I returned this book."
2,Romance Story,"This story has a little suspense. Kept me interested in the plot about a third of the way through then lost me because I began to anticipate the next actions of the hero and heroine. Heroine was much to naivete but considering the era the story took place, it was a normal behavior. Lost interest and didn't finish the story."
5,"Oh, You Lucky Reader!","What a treat! The re-issue of Flowers From The Storm brings back a book that is remarkable as both a great Laura Kinsale novel and a blockbuster romance.FFTS is a joy. It takes readers places that most writers are afraid to venture. After all, love between a stroke victim and a timid Quaker girl? Fear not. Laura Kinsale makes it work with jaw-dropping style. Everything in this book jumps off the page in exquisite, engaging detail. This book reaches out and holds the reader captive until the last sentence gets it's period placed. As a reader, FFTS enthralls me. As an aspiring writer, FFTS inspires me.I envy the reader who gets to discover Laura Kinsale's work for the first time with FFTS. My recommendation? Buy several copies because you will read the covers off of this book. Don't let yourself ever have to live without this book."
1,flowers from the storm annoys,"The premise was terrific, the setup was lovely, the heroine was the most annoying, milk toast, un heroic woman I have ever had the bad luck to read about. At 91% read she was still running away. The story gave her many opportunities to rise and each time she wilted.more concerned with her own version of spiritual comfort than with actually doing the right thing. I couldn't even finish this garbage."
2,Beautiful romance?????,"The first half of this book is so dark and gloomy that it was torture to read. Not to mention the actual physcial torture the patients received at this institution. Sadly, this is probably how stroke victims were treated.The characters were not likeable in any way. The author delved way to deep into Christian's mind and some of the things he thought were startlingly scary. I just don't think a mental institution is the place for a romance even if the patient isn't really insane.Maddy was so consumed with guilt that everytime a rare romantic moment did appear it was ruined by her thoughts of God. I found her extremely annoying.There was absolutely no witty dialogue of any kind. How could there be? An extremely religious Quaker woman and a man who could barely talk. I just didn't like this story."
2,Surprisingly Bad!,"I'm really not sure why so many people seem to love this book. The hero is mean and selfish, and not in any sort of endearing way at all. The heroine is a hypocrite with absolutely no personality. He has a stroke, she nurses him through it, then is forced to marry him and they fight about a million things and don't even seem to care about each other. After all this they somehow live happily ever after at the end. Oh also he totally doesn't care that a former mistress of his had his baby and wants him to take care of it. The end. Most cherished love story of all time my [...]. Try writing some characters that aren't completely annoying and flat first.I only give this review 2 stars because for some reason I finished the book. At an unnecessary 533 pages it was pretty painful."
2,COULDN'T FINISH IT,"I was very excited to get this book because it rated so well, but I quickly became very disappointed. I found this book to be very slow. I found myself skimming the pages, just waiting for some action. Maddy the female character was just too prudish for me. I know she was Quaker, but come on, she was so boring. I was just waiting for her to come alive. I only read 3/4 of the way through. I just couldn't get into it like everyone else did."
5,Excellent,"Talk about blocking out the sun! Wow this does it and the quality is really nice, better than I expected, will for sure last years. It does take a little getting use to as far as handling goes depending on the size of your windshield. I have a Honda Civic so the shade is rather large. For me, with my small hands its awkward to hold onto and roll up. In my opinion its worth every penny."
5,11 years later,"It's a timeless pop record. The melodic tendencies here is what really separates it from other pop records of its time. The infectious acoustics flow along playfully on the more uptempo songs like ""Obscurity Knocks"" and ""Only Tongue Can Tell"". My favorite track though is ""Thrupenny Tears"". It begins quiet and subtle, guided by a heartwarming melody and continues along beautifully throughout. I'm more partial to the pleasant, downtempo songs like ""The Best Man's Fall"" with it's clever lyrics (""She came into my life/like a brick through a window and I/ cracked a smile"") and ""Funny"", another melodic pleaser with equally witty lyrics. I suppose the real challenge in enjoying this album to the fullest is decifering some of the lyrics (strong Scottish annunciation?)and meaning (Scottish humor?). I'm not sure. I don't even think I care very much because overall, the music is fantastic even in 2001."
3,Small slice of sweetness,"Gracefully exiting the eighties with an underrated debut of Brit-alt-pop, the sunny, yet emotional melodies and constant pop energy almost eradicates the need for production remastering, but the group's few full-fledged song triumphs cannot compete with inherently luke-warm compositions that leech talented transitioning to elevate generic qualities."
5,Wonderful Book,A very welcomed addition to addiction liturature! The theology presented gives new insight into alcoholism.

3,pleased with the little red wagon,"product was shipped very quicklyeasy to assembletwo and a half year old daughter loves it- places toys and animals in itimportant to know that the wagon is very small and is really only for smaller toys and small stuffed animals or dolls. However, the miniature is adorable."
4,usefulness,"The wagon was adorable and my granddaughter loved it , It is durable but will not be used very long as she is tall for 21mons. The educational part , well I think it helps with co-ordination. I would like it to be larger so it would last longer."
3,Not for any kid older than toddler!,"I got this for my son who just turned 5 and really wished I had gotten him the bigger one. I misunderstood the dimensions (oops!) and yeah, this thing is TINY! Cute, don't get me wrong, but for any kid beyond the walking popper toy, this is too small :("
3,"Eh, it's ok","It was much smaller than I thought it would be, but that is not the product's fault.Otherwise is is sturdy, a tad difficult to steer for my 2 year old, and quite loud unless it is on carpet. It mainly is used to store other toys in."
2,"A ""little"" Little Red Wagon that is not a toy.",This was intended to be a toy for a toddler but is more like a display or theme container. Is not suitable as a real wagon.It will only serve as a pull toy for a short time in that the handle is too short for most children to comfortably pull.Like most wagons it has a tendency to tip over when turned sharply to right or left. Not quite big enough for a child to ride in and would not be safe to do so. Stability will be a problem for toddlers. This will be frustrating to a child.If you are looking for a toy this is NOT RECOMMENDED. It would make a great container for gift or display.
1,This is a child's toy,I bought this wagon to help move stuff around my yard. It is so small that it should be in the child toy section as it is so small it is worthless for hauling anything. At about one foot long we had a good laugh at the prospect of it ever hauling anything except maybe a small stuffed animal for a child.
1,Tiny wagon is useless,"Way too small to be useful. I would never have purchased this had the dimensions been posted more clearly, I intend to return this ASAP."
2,"A ""coming of age"" story it's not!","The majority of this book is about a 15 year-old boy witnessing a bunch of cowboys he is riding with murder, maim, and rape...without protest on his part. In the end, after nearly drowning, he decides to go home. Spare me!!!If you really want to read a great book about blacks pioneering the West, read ""The Personal Story of Rachel DuPree"" by Ann Weisgarber."
4,dont be shy,"Apollyon Suns' experimental ""SUB"" kicks old-school metal through its recognised limits. This album reeks power from its concoction of heavy, sick guitar, Fischers knowing chants and its sublime electronic death rattles. I have this album, be warned tracks: ""Reefer Boy"", ""Dweller"" wont leave your head alone."
3,My 5-year old loves it!,"I got this movie with no expectations becasue my lids were interested in it. It actually was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Considering that most of the ideas came from a 6-year old, I found it watchable. My daughter watched it once the first day, 4 times the 2nd day, once on the 3rd day (she ended up on a playdate or I am sure that it would have been several times that day as well) She watched another time during the week because school, homework, and a school performance got in the way. She is looking forward to tomorrow when she can watch it again. It may not be Oscar worthy by adult standards but the kids seem to really like it."
1,Umm... that other review is wrong,I want to point out that this UMD [not DVD] is the 2-D version. Which sucks more than the 3-D version. You only get 4 pairs of 3-D glasses when you [oh please don't] buy the DVD. [or UMD for that matter] This comes with a UMD and... that's it!!!!! Please [don't] rent it before you [don't] buy it.
1,terrible,"You can't call it anything else but terrible. Once It got to the end of movie when Max discovers it's just a dream,it get's really stupid. The story is intresting,but gets way off at lots of parts. One,who thought of a brainstorm,that was stupid. Robert Rodriguez did terrible too. The acting was made out of poo. There's no bright colors because the bad guy wants ""darkness"". Don't see it,rent it or think about it. Dream about another dream like burn this movie up and buy a stick. Don't get this movie period."
5,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl,"The three selections were a gift the only objection I heard has been corrected, the error was on my part by ordering a dvd for PlayStation instead of a normal DVD player.Thank YouGordonwrksys@myfairpoint.net"
5,Movie,My 6 year old granddaughter and seen this movie on television and wanted a copy. She loved the 3d glasses that came with it and watches the movie all the time. It was a great gift and the disk was in perfect condition.
1,Negative stars,"Almost certainly the worst children's film of all time. It's almost impossible to have anything ""shark"" or ""lava"" that wouldn't make my two boys (4&6 yrs) excited, but I'm serious when I say I see more smiles out of them when we go to the dentist. For a kid not to be amused is bad enough, but if you are an adult trying to stay with this mess, it's downright painful. The worst 90 minutes I ever spent in the movies."
3,3d movie,"I was pleased with the movie itself.It was in great condition, however, I did not like that it was 3D. I will not purchase anymore 3D movies. I will order other things from this seller."
2,Weird,"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is a weird movie. If I didnt know any better I would've thought someone wrote this while they were stoned. It's all over the map, but I guess that's ok if you're 7 years old. The kids' acting is horrible and makes you cringe. Lopez is the only good part of the whole movie. I wanted more from Rodriguez."
1,The movie was gay!,Good god I didn't like it. I thought it would be cool but it wasn't. The special effects are really corny and dumb. You didn't miss out anything on the 3D because I didn't see anything realistic with it. My advice don't waste your money on this. I'm 13 years old and if I were 8 I would probably like it but now that I'm 13 I think it's the dumbest movie ever. Spy Kids was okay but this was stupid. Please do not see it!
1,An Overpriced Paperweight,"Before you even think one second about buying a Panasonic DVD Recorder, just type ""Panasonic U99 error"" into your favorite search engine and you will find hundreds of complaints about software errors with Panasonic DVD Recorders. They tried to send a firmware ""upgrade"" through the cable signal and it ended up locking up machines and making them inoperable. When you call Panasonic and sit on hold for two hours, the person who finally answers acts as if they've never heard of the problem and they give you totally useless information. I can only hope my credit card company will honor an extended warranty, otherwise I have a $500 paperweight. AWFUL!!!!!"
1,Panasonic's big loser,"I've had my DMR-E95H since March and it continues to have problems. I have spent hours on the phone with Panasonics tech support (what a waste of time that is), and even had to send the unit in for repair. I was getting the dreaded U99 error. Well, I got the unit back about two weeks ago and now I get absolutely no TV guide listings and every hour or so while I am watching something, the unit just shuts itself off. Panasonic really needs to rethink it's engineering of this product and should apologize to all the folks that already wasted good money on this piece of crap. Don't buy this one, look at the other manufacturers."
5,Outstanding!,This album immediately became one of my favorites for winding down at the end of a a hard day. She's taken classic songs and given them a whole new meaning! What a great vocal range.
3,remembrance day,"A good tale, well told. Well-developed characters are set in an intriguing plot, with a nice balance between procedural detail, descriptive material, and suspense.Unfortunately the lack of proof-reading [at least in the US, Simon & Schuster edition] results in innumerable typographical errors, which were extremely distracting and spoilt the reading pleasure.Had the publisher made any effort in this regard, I would have awarded 4 stars.I hope that Mr. Porter will write more books of this ilk, and that he will take note of this deficiency. END"
5,Great Indie film with heart,RID OF ME is great indie film! The actress playing Meris (Katie O'Grady) is fantastic. You start out feeling so bad for her and cringing at all the bad stuff that happens. Then you get to see so many different sides of her you end up loving Meris. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
1,THESE ARE NOT AIMCO ROTORS!!!!!!!!,"I recieved these rotors and they were not AIMCO they were FAP automotive and Made in China. Yes, the price was decent, but I felt like I had been cheated."
5,Outstanding Reference on Economists and their schools,"The only book I've seen, outside the Palgrave reference book, that gives brief vignettes on different economists and their schools. Author does not mince words, writes strong, and gets to the point. A nice one-volume tome. Also includes some mathematics, which is nice."
2,Very disappinted with the new taste.,"I used to love this stuff. It was tasty, filling, and full of the right kind of nutrients. However, a while back they came up with a new formula or something I suppose, and the taste changed drastically. It tasted as if the milkshake had been mixed with some kind of bitter tasting medicine... it completely ruined the product for me. I won't be buying them anymore."
3,Good. Not disgusting like before.,"I had tried Slim Fast in the past and it had tasted like chocolate-flavored mucus in a can.These, however, were quite good. I enjoyed having them and will buy some again. I didn't lose any weight but these tasted good.If you have a lot of food allergies like me you may want to use caution. I was mildly allergic to something in them. I googled it and many people have had the same reaction. I still drank them, though. The wheeze went away in a little bit."
3,Not sure...,"I am not sure how I feel about the flavor. I am a nurse and the smell of the Vanilla shake is like that of the feedings we give patients who can't tolerate oral food. So, I am very sensitive to that smell and it makes it hard for me to really taste the product. In hopes of improving it for me I do pour it into my coffee cup which has a little coffee left in it. I do find it slightly more filling that the meal bars though. Also, the ease of bringing this to work for lunch is great. I think next time I will try a different flavor."
1,"ALL CANS ARE DENTED, NEW FORMULA IS SICKENING","I've drank slimfast before in the past many, many times. I've usually enjoyed all of them, and never had any side effects or complaints about taste or texture.There's just something not right with this new slimfast. I don't know if it's because all of my CANS WERE DENTED, or if maybe it sat in the sun somewhere.Despite the horrible taste, I spent so freakin' much on the order that I forced myself to consume as much of a can as humanly possible. About three fourths, with breaks and other ""chaser"" beverages.Without going into detail, it did a number on my stomach. I had a case of the horribles.If you're insistent on giving this new slimfast a shot, I suggest purchasing it from a local store in a smaller quantity where you can insure that you're able to return it hassle free (read: trying to ship a case of slimfast back), and know it won't look like someone beat it up."
2,What the Flake?,"Despite vigorous shaking, about half of the cans in my order contained soggy particles that reminded me of breadcrumbs. They were mostly grey-ish white, and left a smearing residue when squished between fingers.I first noticed these particles when I was drinking my third or so can on my way to work. I thought, That was odd, maybe it was a one time deal? Nope. Found more flaky particles. Felt really grossed out. When I returned home from work I opened another can after vigorously shaking, poured it in a clear glass, and saw about a dozen or so flakes rise to the surface. It could be congealed minerals, but it's definitely gross, and I don't want to drink them. I'm hoping the other pack I received (two sets of 12) is flake-free. If not, I'll call Slim and request a refund. We'll see how that goes!"
5,Great for an active baby!,"My five month old absolutely loves this activity center! He is an active baby who loves to stand (supported of course) and grab things. In this Center, the lowest height settings allows him to stand and reach all of the toys without any assistance. Plus, each toy provides him with different stimulation. And he loves when his father plays with the puppet! We would highly recommend this toy!"
3,Poorly made if you ask me,"I purchased this activity center for my 5 month old daughter. She seemed to be entertained with all the attached toys. However, I found out all too quickly that it is a poorly made item. The ribbons on the 3 tier plush toy began to fray when my daughter put them in her mouth and she started choking on them. I needed to wash the seat cover and so when I removed it for the 1st time since I purchased it, the plastic attachments that hold the seat in place started to bend. The stands that hold the activity center in place broke. I called the company and they gladly replaced the seat and sent me a new plush toy that does not contain the ribbons on top, and new stands. Although my daughter seemed occupied in it, I am quite disappointed with the make of it. It could have been made a bit more sturdier."
5,So far so good,"My baby girl is just 5 months old and loves playing in this exersaucer. Assembly was easy, there is something to help with all areas of development both big and small motor skills. I love that it's stationary as I would not purchase a walker for my girl due to the hazards associated with same yet it gives her ample opportunity to turn around and stand up and use differnet muscles."
4,Great Purchase,"We bought this for our 6-month-old son not because of the ""Baby Einstein"" brand, but because it only had one battery-powered feature out of nine items around the circle for him to play with. Our son had not really taken to many ""gadgets"", i.e. his bouncy seat, swing, etc. until we bought this. It keeps his attention, he can chew on most of the toys (a big plus as he is teething) and he always smiles when we put him in it.One (wierd) aside, the triangle top on the three-shaped stacked toy has a realistic picture of a fire-engine on it with engine number ""69"" prominently displayed on its front. Maybe this is just my adult mind running wild, but is this some kind of sick joke by the company, or only a coincidence??? I didn't find it funny, or cute, or however they intended it or not...Other than that negative, it is well designed and our son loves it."
3,Love the Education disappointed hold up,"We registered for the Discover & Play Activity Center and got it at our baby shower. We were delighted the day that our daughter could sit up to use it! She instantly fell in love with the animal sounds, the chewable parts and the noises she could make on the wheel! We loved how it keeps her entertained and allowes her to movement she so despratly craves at 7 months old! I am however disappointed with how it is holding up over time. We have been using it for 3 weeks now and the seat is beginning to rip, the red support legs that are supposed to keep it stable are giving way, and the strings on the top of the triangle are falliing apart and we had to detangle our daughter from them. I am surprised and diappointed in how quickly it is wearing out, after only 3 weeks of use! We love the educational part of it, but if it doesn't hold up we will be forced to purchase a new activity center and for $80 I would think it would be stronger and more baby proff."
2,Product's engineering stinks.,"I'm sure many people disagree with me but I think how this activity area's made is very poor. I wonder if its just me or does the seat snaps seem cheap. The eyeholes to the fabric don't fit to the clips on the seat and they break or warp. The company sent us a new plastic seating and they still have the same issue. The plastic seat seems so cheap compared to the rest of the product.The rest of the stuff looks great but our daughter can't use it because of their seat design flaw. Any company can make toys now, but making the structure to hold it needs to be relooked at by this company. I give this a thumbs down. I'm returning it."
4,Great Product!,I have a 6 month old and she really enjoys time spent in the activity center. I like this product because it allows for exploration and it gives me a few minutes to get dinner made!
4,They LOVE This Toy!,"I have 5 month old twins and they LOVE this toy... They really enjoy the dragon and the sun. They also love the animal sounds. I like that the names of the animals are said in both english and spanish. The only minor little thing I found wring with this is that the red dye from the stacked shapes bleeds. It came off on my babies clothes and I didn't know where it came from so when I took a wet paper towel and touched every part of the toy, the shapes were the culprit. But still, I would recommend this toy to anyone who has to entertain a 5 month old, especially if you have 2 to entertain!"
4,A walker does its job,"We have both SmartSteps Exersaucer and Baby Einstein walkers. One is at my MIL's place, other is at home.In my opinion, SmartSteps Exersaucer is the ultimate walker, while Baby Einstein, 20 dollars cheaper, does its job fine, too.While assembling, my husband noticed that SmartSteps Exersaucer had a few designs are better than Baby Einstein.For example, SmartSteps Exersaucer has extra springs in its legs. My son likes to jump, the SmartSteps Exersaucer would bounce with him. Some toys are detachble so it is like having extra toys around.As far as fun for the baby, I feel my son had just enough fun in the Baby Einstein walker. Though SmartSteps Exersaucer has a lot more toys, I am not sure if it makes him happier."
4,Love it!,My daughter loves this activity center. I wish they would change two things about it. I wish we could change out the toys and it folded up.
2,It's not really that interesting,Our baby got bored after only a 15min. There just isn't that much stuff to interact with. He just figured it out and then was done. It's really just stuff to look at with a few things that make sounds. I would try borrowing one first before you buy. It is a big item to have around the house if your child won't get that much use out of it.
2,You can do better,"I am a first time mom and loved the baby einstein line. This is a great product - sturdy, good-looking, but there are better products out there. I own this one, but my mom bought one for her house that has so many better features. My daughter got bored with these toys FAST. And lets face it, they get dirty. Evenflo has removable and REPLACABLE toys. You can get new ones. And this Baby Einstein one needs the baby to be pretty tall to start using it. Evenflo starts much lower for shorter babies and it lets them jump a little too - something kids love to do. Good product, but better ones out there for less money"
3,Not great for short babies,"My daughter really seems to enjoy this play center, however, she is right around the 50% for height, and at 7 months old, she just now reaches the bottom.We put it together when she was 4 months old, and she didn't seem to have much interest in it until she was 6 months old. Now that she can reach the bottom, I think she is more comfortable in it and can enjoy it for a longer period of time.Overall, it's a good product, but if you have a small baby, I would look at other products before you decide on this one. On the flip side, I guess I'll be able to use it longer -- if my daugher is still interested in it."
4,Our daughter LOVES it!,"We got this play center for our daughter who was 5 months old at the time and she really enjoys it. The toys are bright and stimulating and encourage interaction (press a button to hear sounds, see lights, etc).The only reasons I didn't give this item 5 stars are:1) The feet that keep the saucer flat on the ground occassionally pop in (which makes it wobble).2) If your child is teething (as our daughter is) he or she will attempt to chew on all the toys which will make the sticks that hold them crooked and will mean you have to wash the toys that are covered in cloth fairly often (thus fading them).All in all, I would buy this item again anyway even with the couple of things I disliked about it."
4,"Loved it in the earlier months, but not into it now","Our 9 month old enjoyed this in the earlier months but he is not into it now. He really loved the starfish and sun. Later on he discovered how to bang on the soundbox to make sounds (really loved that). He totally adored the book too. However, now he will play with the toys OUTSIDE of the seat, but try to stick him in the seat and its like trying to wrestle an aligator into a barrel! He just fusses a lot. Sometimes he will play happily so long as I am right near him playing and talking to him. My advice is don't buy it if you can, have grandma or grandpa do that; but if you get it don't bank on having an eternally blissful experience with it forever."
5,give it a try ;-),"This was a really good buy for us. My little guy didn't know how to take this play center at first ( the sound of the yellow wheel scared him initially) but after a little while, he discovered the dragon and played with him so hard that I thought he would tear it to shreds! He is now turning and playing with everything...even the yellow wheel!! He's even turning the little plastic book and looking at the animals before laughing at himself in the mirror. I'd tell any parent to at least give it a try."
2,not that great,My son has beheaded the sun and one of the legs does not stay put on the non rocking feature....but what a pain to bring back to Babies r us......and he really does not last long in this thing...consider something else...
5,My babies most favorite toy!,"I have a 5 month old daughter and we have had this play center for about a month. SHE LOVES IT!!! It didn't take her long to spin herself around so she can look and play with everything. She especially loves the red, blue and yellow spinners (first things she discovered) and now she's really into the button that makes the cow sounds and laughs at daddy and I while we dance to the song. Everything is brightly colored and she can sit in it for hours. She also loves to ""talk"" to the dragon puppet. It's her favorite toy."
2,Problems with base and legs,"Although my son loves this playcenter, we have had continous problems with the three legs that are suppose to hold the base off the ground. We have been using the toy for about a month and a half and I have had to contact Graco twice because the red legs keep popping which drops the base to the floor. Un- fortunately, it doesn't happen simultaneously which leaves the playcenter uneven and dangerous for my son to be in. At this point I wish I would have purchased an exersaucer that was a bit bouncy so that this problem would not occur. Graco has already sent me three need legs and I am now awaiting a new base and new legs. Even though Graco has been helpful, all I want is my money back so I can purchase a safer toy for my son."
1,Two defective units in a row!,"I purchased this MR16 from American Musical Supply. It was defective from the start. I pressed power, the LED screen lit up for 1 second and immediately shut off. I exchanged it for another one. This happened on both the original return and the replacement. Ridiculous. This was not a refurbished item. It was BRAND NEW! I am shocked that a brand with Fostex's reputation can churn out this defective garbage. If it was only the first one, I would write it off as a fluke, but this is clearly more common than that."
5,A fantastic way to explore new ideas.,"I LOVE this book! I have read it three times, and each time I learn something more. Deepak gives tons of information based on quantum physics to help teach you how to fulfill your most powerful life desires. It really does work. Buy it, you won't regret it."
2,I think it's flat too,"Wayne Dyer is better(most of his books). Tiffany Snow is better (all of her books). Some of Chopra's earlier works are better. Many books are better than this, this one just repeats most of what we already know, so why bother?"
5,Spontaneous Fulfillment,Great CD's!!All of the information needed to take you to the next level of spirituality.
2,I agree with FLAT,"I agree with the other interview here. I haven't read the other two books cited, but I did read Snow's book, and got a lot out of it. In my book, Deepak has been ""Snowed"" over."
3,Too Mellow,"Aside from a truly sublime moment in Hayfever, I've Seen Everything is too mellow for my tastes. That said, it's still far better than their previous album Cake. The first two songs are the best on the album. Most of the rest sound half finished (case in point is Killing the Cabinet). However, if you like mellow British music (like The Lilac Time or The Auteurs) then you'll probably like this CD.[DW]"
4,Great poster and service,My order got lost by the mail and Amazon was great at their service and got me another order asap.. Great services
5,Incredible,"This album is by far, the best album no one has heard. It is phenonenal all the way through. You will find yourself listening to it over and over again and you will want to listen to it again."
5,Hauntingly beautiful!,"Firstly, I'm an artist, not a music reviewer. That said, In the Nursery is my all-time favorite musical find. I consider L'Esprit the crowning achievement for In the Nursery. The music is hauntingly beautiful yet not ostentatious. ITN deftly uses a self-limited range of instrumental tracks and angelic voices to create a pure, stirring sound. Pieces range from snare-drum driven active to dreamy peaceful melodies. The cuts begin, grow, flow, then conclude as cohesive units, each to its own yet more stirring when brought together. I loved the calm yet stirring beauty of ""Saurette"" so much I used it as the processional in my wedding. This is truly music to inspire the imagination!"
3,The old 90's,"I remember seeing this band open for LA Guns in 1992, at the Vic Theatre in Chicago (free tickets too). They were pretty good. I like Tribal Monkey and Just Another Day. I remember that I listened to this quite a few times as I drove to Florida in that summer. Even though they were not a hair metal band like the band they opened for, they were still another victim of the grunge scene taking over about that time."
3,Nothing special,"Cheaply made, date hand did not work on arrival. Looks OK but might have done better to shop for this type of watch locally so that I could see what I was buying and return it easily if not satisfied."
4,GOOD BUY,"I buy this watch base on a previous purchase. i bought the Casio men 10-year battery red dial, i received the item on time and in good condition.this watch is fashionable you can use this watch as a dress watch or a sport watch, and to crown it of the battery life is ten years which is superb, you don,t have to worry about battery for ten yrs.GOOD BUY."
5,Well worth the money,"I got this kit to retrofit/repair my '92 toyota's failing a/c system. It has been a few months now since I used it and the a/c works perfectly. The leaks are gone, the compressor works quitely and the system seems to work even colder than before. A local a/c shop quoted me $381 for recharging the system, it would have been higher for detecting and fixing any leaks."
4,good western,"This western is prettygood, doesn't have a lot of foul, vulgar language that most people seem to enjoy hearing in a movie these days. Ithas a good plot(story for those not inclinded to expand their vocabulary), isn't a really bloody, gory movie. and was written by a couple of really good writers of westerns. buy it if you like good westerns."
5,Nicely worded and a great recommendation!,"As I have mentioned above, this book is very descriptive of infinitesmial details and even though it may be a myth, it certainly is very vividly entertaining. Myths are generally thought to be boring but this one's a classic. It is narrated as a daily journal and that's what makes it even more detailed and makes the reader feel like he or she is present in that moment of time. A great gift for a myth lover!"
3,Universal Language of Music,"This is the first book I've seen that links music, sound, and spoken word to chakras and healing centers in the body. Just as chakras respond to certain thoughts, and colors, the vibration of certain notes resonate to corresponding chakras. The right combination of sound and tone can be used to aid in spiritual healing. Ted Andrews describes a fascinating history of storytelling and music throughout time, the importance of maintaining oral and musical traditions. Sacred Sounds also covers the important power of words, and what actions they can create. This is a great and informative handbook on music and healing."
1,Is this comedy or what?,"Sorry guys, I respect everyone's opinions, but this stuff sound laughable to me. I never thought epic metal was really appealing, since I doubt electric guitars mix well with medieval atmospheres. But I do think people like Ronnie James Dio were wise enough to keep the music somewhat on a different level than what it tried to represent. Imagery is one thing, being a parody is somewhat different. This CD sounds like a group that's actually trying to make fun of epic metal. Unless you're into this stuff (being it COMPLETE devotion to the most cartoon-like wannabe Superhero Knights) I recommend to avoid this like the plague."
5,"Should have been titled, 'To Sir with Love'","I was really looking forward to this after reading the first one, and I'm happy to say I loved it! It IS kind of a weird love story, but it's great nonetheless! And I've learned not to try to rationalize things when reading yaoi because, well...it's YAOI! :)Oh, and I loved the extra 'Valentines Day' story - too cute...Enjoy!"
5,Honey Lingers... boy does it ever!,"My first experience with these 2 fabulous women and their band dates back in the early 90's. I heard the 'hit?' Monsters and Angles on a 80's flash back type radio show and I was hooked. I ran out and bought the CD and pretty much like every song on it. When the girls harmonize they sound smooth as honey. I happen to like bubble gum type music and theirs is as sugary sweet as it gets. Some might say it has a raunchy flavor, but I find it rather provocative, if not totally true! My personal favorite besides 'Monsters and Angles' is 'Say It'. I am a hopeless romantic as well so this song is very fitting... ahh now if I could just find the woman in that song..."
5,One Word - Fab-U-Licious!,"This group is great! Sandy, Tera, and Bryn (The fabulous three of Risquée) have put together an awesome CD. The CD has orginal songs like ""Call It Love"" and ""Now I Know"" as well as covers of past popular hits such as Diana Ross' ""Upside Down"" and Pebbles' ""Girlfriend"". And if great voices weren't enough, these three are HOT! I hope to see more of this talented trio in the near future!"
2,Flash and Filigree,"Strange book...totally not what I expected from the man who wrote Easy Rider. Actually funny in a couple of spots, but left me feeling perplexed as to why I read it."
5,"Amazing Camera, Amazing Price!","I bought this camera because my wife was tired of scanning pictures for online auctions. When I saw how good the pictures were, and how well they printed on an HP PhotoSmart printer (even the 640x480 as an 8x10 was beautiful!) I realized I had a great match! Get NiMH batteries, for sure, but you can use it without the screen and save power. Also, Olympus sells (and you can get it here at Amazon) a PCMCIA adapter for the SmartMedia cards, which pretends to be a spare hard drive. Cool! Get the 16 or 32 MB Card if you take lots of pics, but at lowest res I get 240+ pics on a 16MB chip."
4,Olympus D450,Bought this camera thinking that I could find the other parts that go with easily but I am still okking for some of the parts and the memory card. It is taking more time to find the accessories than I excpected but will eventually have all the parts I need.
4,"Camera is great, accessories are another thought","Wife bought camera for gift. Owners manual suggest using AC adapter to download pictures to PC. Can't find the Adapter. No internet site advertises and no store front carries it. Can't buy it on Olympus site, no option to do so. I don't want the floppy adapter. AC adapter is more suitable for me.Other wise, this is camera is the best. Would give 5 stars if adapter was available."
3,nice soft towels,"they do tend to form little fuzz balls, but I've only washed them a couple of times. They are very soft and absorbant, my only dislike is that the design is only on one end of the towel, so you must pay attention to that when hanging them, just a nuisance. I would purchase them again however!"
3,6-pc Towel Set - Good but not great,"Don't get me wrong. It's certainly a nice set of towels for the money. I got a small handful of lint in the first wash, which you will want to do before you can expect any reasonable absorbency out of these towels. I was also disappointed to find about a 12-inch piece of thread that had separated from the border of one of the bath towels, which I had to cut with scissors. There was also a bit more pilling of the terry cloth than I expected. But I would still consider these above average towels due to their size and thickness. I would really prefer to rate the item at 3 1/2 stars, but that's not an option.UPDATE - I have to return the towels for replacement or refund. The edging on one of the bath towels started to disintegrate after only the second washing! And the pilling is more pronounced with the terry cloth becoming more uneven. I would NOT recommend these towels."
4,"Pretty Good, ""Cute"" & ""Sweet"" in Some areas","Okay, I was not wow'd by this book, but found it to be a decent, more subtle read. The main character is endearing, she doesn't flinch in any situation to stand up to whomever necessary and do what is morally right. I think that because of that, you inevitably root for her. It is also interesting that a man wrote this book from a woman's point of view and did do a pretty convincing job of it. However, I was not so moved by the book that it made me want to go out and read all of the more recent books by that author, some featuring the same main character. This was not a bad book that I regret reading, but it didn't really leave any lasting impressions or feelings with me either."
5,Buy this wonderful debut!,"THE LADIES' NO. 1 DETECTIVE AGENCY is the first novel by Alexander McCall Smith, a medical law professor at Edinburgh University. A wonderful book with smart characterizations and enough mystery to keep you going; the scenery is breathtaking, if somewhat severe: we are at the edge of the Kalahari. There are many interesting details about life in Africa, specifically Botswana, and many intriguing insights into mores and manners. I really enjoyed this book! Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"
3,Not really a mystery,"This book is about an African women deciding to open a detective agency because she thought she could help people. The characters are engaging, but the ""mysteries"" she solves are not so engaging.I really enjoyed reading about Botswana and everyday life. I thought that was the best part of the book. The characters, especially Precious, are entertaining, but I felt the author could have made them more complex. The book is fairly humorous, but not laugh out loud funny. More dialogue probably would have been a pleasant addition.I can't recommend this book if you are looking for a mystery. I would hesitantly recommend this book if you're interested in learning more about everyday life in Botswana. I found the book to0 simple."
3,Entertaining,A friend recommended the book to me and I found it quite entertaining but it didn't totally grab my imagination and make me feel as though I couldn't put it down.
3,"Simple, But Ever So Sweet","The problems Botswana's Lady Detective, Mma Ramotswe solves aren't solved in a masterful way, ala Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Yet there is a sweetness to this story that pervades. The relationships amongst the people are deep, and dear.Would that the protagonist had more complex problems to solve. Or that the one difficult problem wasn't abetted in a contrived situation. How interesting is it to read about someone being followed and a problem being solved just like that!Nevertheless, the patois seems authentic. There is a lyrical quality to the dialog that is enchanting. It's also a relief to read about any African country without hearing stories of bloodshed and depravity.I'm going to read some more books in this series."
1,so boring,"I bought this book after reading all those fabulous reviews ,it was so boring that no matter how hard I forced myself I couldn't go on reading after the 40th page .You could feel that the writer was a novice from the start"
5,The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,"I had this book sent to my sister in Arizona. I know it arrived in good time, so I assume it all went smoothly. It did on my end!"
2,Too simplistic,"While the characters are mildly engaging, the plotlines in this book are rather uninteresting. I found the solutions to the mysteries glaringly obvious, and I am not one of those people who can routinely figure out whodunit by page 15. Precious Ramotswe is a likable but bungling detective who repeatedly gets found out by the people she is supposed to be trailing (yes, I know it's part of the plot, but it's rather irritating). The novel is just barely worth reading for the pleasant local color, but as far as intelligent mystery fiction goes, I would rather reread any Dorothy Sayers novel--except the execrable _Thrones, Dominations_, completed posthumously by another author--for the umpteenth time, than continue following Mma Ramotswe's career."
3,A different kind of book,"This is a different kind of mystery novel, so much so that it doesn't really seem like a mystery. Even though the main character solves several different mysteries throughout the story, the interesting part of this book is how it is written. It's set in Africa, so it's different from your standard mystery novel right off the bat. Plus, Smith's writing style is quite different from anything I've read before. In addition, there is no one central plot to this story, although there is one big mystery that Precious must solve. I didn't love this book, as many reviewers did, but I found it interesting and unique, so I must commend it for that."
3,Not So Number One,"Overall the book was a pretty good detective story and I really enjoyed all the many obstacles Mma. Ramotswe had encountered. The main weakness and the one reason why I gave this book only three stars is that there wasn't really a main point to the whole thing. Normally there is always a purpose the author tries to accomplish in the book, but there wasn't. As the book went along, the main charater had been hired for several different jobs, but the book didn't focus on a specific one. There was a couple of times when I thought that one might be important throughout the book, but ended up not being anything. If the author would've made a specific case end up being a huge part of the book, then I thought that the book would be a five star. Overall, I enjoyed it and it was a easy read if looking for something not so complicated."
1,"No plot, and too much sex.","This book was highly recommended to me, but I'm afraid I was extremely disappointed. I realize this point of view is becoming old-fashioned, but the immorality was very offensive to me. Her new fiancee basically rapes her, in plenty of detail, and she marries him anyway. It should come as no surprise to readers that he continues to abuse her until he finally leaves her. There is not a single chapter that doesn't refer to sex in some way.Besides that, the book is quite simple. Every mystery is easily solved in one chapter, with no twists anywhere. The first five chapters are spent telling every detail not only of her life up to that point, but also her father's. But none of it ties in with the rest of the book. Basically nothing ""ties in"" at the end of the book. It just rambles on until it finally stops, leaving the reader craving a book with some kind of plot. If you are looking for a good lady detective, try Mrs. Pollifax."
3,Ok--- There are better books,I was extremely disappointed with this book. They made it seem like the huge mystery would be about the missing boy and it really wasn't anything but a chapter. It was just ok to me---I have read better.
4,"Nine books later, I revise my view!","I had originally written a much less positive review after reading the first book of this series, but something about it stuck with me and kept me reading the next one...and the next...and so on. I'm up to the tenth now! These stories will definitely not be to everyone's taste, but Smith is a highly skilled writer and there really isn't anything else like this series that I've encountered. They are sweet and lovely, as everyone says, without being condescending to characters or reader. They're also just plain fun to read, and I've really enjoyed them a lot."
4,Maybe Not #1 But...,"When someone who isn't a mystery reader recommends a mystery, I always want to read it, and this one was recommended by my sister-in-law. It's a sweet little book, and while I didn't like it as much as I'd hoped, I did enjoy it. I prefer more traditionally-constructed mysteries. Worth a read, and I definitely plan on picking up some of the author's other series"
2,Great expectations,"I knew it would be a light read, but I came undone by how light it was. Not challenging enough for me."
4,Affordable elegance,"The pendulum wall clock is a beautiful addition to my livingroom. The design and finish are stunning. The construction is solid. It truly adds a rich elegance to the room. It has a night silence feature which is nice, but since the volume of the chimes is adjustable, I have chosen to have it ring at the same level all day.Only two things for me that brings this down from a 5 rating.1 The clock does not tick. I was hoping for the gentle ""tick tocking"" I would expect a clock like this to have2 The chime lacks a deep bell tone. The Westminster chime is beautiful, don't misunderstand, but sometimes it sounds just a bit electronic (which it is) rather than the sound of a true chime."
3,Sounds like Expose...,"If you like 90's dance like Expose, you will probably like Laura Enea. Not bad-it will take you back to the 90's."
1,Less than meets the eye,"All I was looking for was how to turn from my humam form into a semi-truck or maybe even a gun or something, but nothing....not even a mention of the Matrix.."
2,"Weak my friends, weak!","First I would to make a remark to all those who generously compared Rhapsody with bands like Blind Guardian Iced Earth. Please don't be silly! No such comparison could be ever made (Rhapsody, they don't even have a proper bas)When I listened to the album for the first time I got this awkward feeling that this is not even heavy metal. The vocals are weak and just not convincing enough, the sound is bellow any standards too.I have to say though that the boys have a good feeling for rhythm (But so do the rappers). Some of the songs are quite good if you listen to them for second-fifth time. ""Page of the winter"" comes to mind here. It is a real shame they don't have any bas.Well I have heard worse, but not very often."
2,a cheesy terrible waste,"I was extremely dissapointed when I picked up this album. Don't get me wrong! I am a big fan of power metal and love many aspects of it. I listen to bands like ICED EARTH and BLIND GUARDIAN. thats good music! this? this is garbage. the lyrics are stupid, the vocals are extremely irratating and over all its cheesy. One of the most incredibally cheesy things i've heard in a while. the only shred of goodness in this album is the musicianship."
1,bad,this movie is very bad it isn't scary unless you are trying to find out why it was made. What ever happened to real suspence? we need another hitchcock!
5,a must have,I borrowed this book from a fellow teacher when I began teaching preschool and just had to buy a copy of my own. It is the best resource for the preschool classroom I have ever read. It is straight-forward and helps with everything from projects to classroom setup and management.
3,Pretty good personal achievement book,"I too read ""Into Thin Air"" and then read this book. ""Seven Summits"" is more about the personal achievements and personal dreams of Bass and Wells than about the details of the Everest climb of ""Into Thin Air"". Even though Bass and Wells were rich guys, they did give up a couple of years of their lives while their personal business futures were far from certain. In other words, I don't think Bass and Wells were a couple of spoiled boys by any means. But they did have the guts (and financial means) to leave their families and risk their lives for a once-in-a-life-time challenge.In my opinion, the writing style is only so-so (no James Michener here), but it is easy reading."
2,A BOOK ABOUT MONEY NOT MOUNTAINEERING,"I thought when I reached the end of the book, the ""heroes"" would change their mind that money is everything and their natural arrogance. I was wrong. This is nothing to do with mountaineering, just what money can buy."
5,Wonderful story,This book showcases the friendship between the two main characters. I loved the friendship and will to succeed they share.
2,just ok one bowl was broken,The larger of the bowls was broken when I recieved it so it was not packet very well. I have used the smaller bowl and loved it.
2,Almost perfect,I loved this stamp...until I used it. You have to use the stamper at least 5 times on some scratch paper before it will completely print. It almost always leaves part of the text unprinted or illegible. Once you really get the whole thing moistened with ink it seems to do better.
2,Travel snack,"Sunridge Farms Butter Toffee Peanuts, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)I purchased these snacks for the purpose of having them available for travel--while airborne and during the land tours. I was disappointed because they did not taste very fresh although I was pleased with the flavor. I placed them in my refrigerator to keep them as fresh as possible but will probably dispose of them eventually since I do not enjoy them. I would not purchase them again."
1,Carly Simon: 5-Stars : Sound: NO-Stars,"This is one of the great albums of any decade! The SHM-CD sound is a disaster, as it clearly demonstrates, by its extra clarity (can anyone say ""boosted-treble, boosted-bass three times fast), that there has been no remastering of the material save the boosted parts of the sound spectrum. The classical releases in this format--try Karajan-Mahler on DGG for a truly memorable earache--are disgraceful. After many tries at finding one ""really better than the original"" SHM-CD, I've given up on what I perceive to be a marketing ploy to pawn off older recordings at a ""boosted"" price.Even though the original release of ""No Secrets"" didn't have the greatest overall sound, it was more-than acceptable do to Ms. Simon (who in the photo leaves ""no secret"" to the fact that she isn't wearing undergarments--excellent!) and her immense talents.Buy the regular CD and skip this expensive turkey. Better yet, if you do vinyl, try to find a good copy."
5,Pure-Pop Classic,"Carly and producer Richard Perry really hit a home run on this release. There isn't one weak track here. In addition to the hits, ""You're So Vain"" & ""The Right Thing to Do"", there were other tracks that were single-worthy, like, ""Night Owl"" written by James Taylor, ""We Have No Secrets"" which is still one of her best, EVER. The song Carly wrote about the relationship between her and her father, ""Embrace Me, You Child"" is still heart-wrenching. The one song that I think is overlooked, is the beautifully simple, ""When You Close Your Eyes"", I remember hearing this song while watching a kids special on TV in the mid-70s. This was her biggest seller for a long time, and well deserved. I often wonder why she only worked with Richard Perry on one more album after this. Anyway, all of Carly's albums are must have for me, if you're just a casual fan, this is a must-have. Enjoy."
3,Far from the terrace,"Very different from the movie & a great read...a novel that's a journey through a different world as well as an unfolding of life that does make you more than a little introspective...I've since bought the Paul Newman movie through Amazon ... its great, but very different. O'Hara is writer who captured an America that few of us ""foreigners"" know about & many now look back to with a sense of nostalgia...I've read 10 North Frederick Street too & enjoyed thatCondition of my copy...unfortunately not that pictured...its vintage but in good condition...well worth the cost."
2,Too wordy to enjoy.,"Diane Raines Ward is obviously a well traveled and well educated person, but it seemed that her personal experiences were what most mattered to her in what could have been a very interesting expose if it was a little less wordy...maybe some good editing would help."
3,"takes good pictures, but not very durable","I have had this camera for a little over a year. It takes very good pictures and has a lot of choices for flash modes. The only bad thing is, the LCD display broke on mine. It was over $60 to fix it."
3,good product,"I find the rpoduct easy to use. but I find that the manual can be made better, one can not clearly understand how to load the batteries, and what batteries to use."
3,broken slide cover,"I enjoyed using this camera for almost three years, but the slide cover broke recently -- I guess it just wore out."
2,Good Camera But Delicate Lense Mechanism,"Camera is compact and takes good pictures. But the lesne mechanism is very delicate and complicated. You need to slide the lense barrier for the lense and the flash to extend. Within 1.5 years, our camera's lense mechnaism broke down. Now the lense does not extend out and camera does not take pictures."
2,"How many ""f"" word useages do you need to ruin a good book?","This had the making of a great book. A good story line, explosive action, human interest and well written. Why did the author have to use the ""f"" word so regularly, so out-of-place and so off putting that it became too difficult to continue reading?"
2,Blah,"I guess it doesn't surprise me that the intellectual level of what one assumes must be an average SAS operator is fairly low. Given the political dirtbags who run such agencies these days, McNab probably quite accurately represents the conformity of thought and uncritical mindset of killers for hire.Tradecraft? Well, I'd love to see a veteran OSS operative run circles around this bozo.It's an interesting read if only for a look into the British soul. It reminds me once again why I feel revulstion towards most Brits; so thank you, McNab.As a purely technical criticism, directed more to the editors than the author, it's always a good idea to have an ending in a book. This one just sort of stops.... Maybe the last couple chapters got lost somewhere?"
5,Erotic/Exotic/Expectacular!!!,"This cd is one of the most beautiful there is to be. Her voice is sensual, the lyrics are a perfect blend of poetry and explicit erotism, this cd is to be regarded as a perfect instrument to woo anybody, one listen and you'll be in a spell wanting to hear it again and again. It has a lot of splendiferous places, take Sunday Afternoons, the sensual near the black forest and the top of the album, at least for me, is My love is too much, this cd can take you to many places wether if you listen to it alone or with somebody is a great companion and vannessa is sultry charmer, full of surprises, my recommendation: this has to be the first album you buy for her and if you already know her this cd is a must have."
1,NOT WORTH A DIME,"The first two discs of the program loaded fine, but the final disc (the one needed to make the program work) refused to load. I contacted the company's ""customer support"" and gee, no surprise, they blamed it on my computer. I had tried loading their disc in three different computers, and that last disc refused to load on any computer. Their customer support refused to provide a new disc. NOT WORTH A DIME!"
3,Problem!!,"This camera is excellent in many regards -- but it has a real flaw. I've had mine for 6 months, and now it will not work; the battery light is on, but new batteries don't solve the problem. The lens moves agonizingly slowly and will not return to its proper position. I thought I was just unlucky but in the last few weeks I've been told about the exact same problem by 2 other people who have this camera!! And I don't converse about cameras very much... Nor is Olympus very helpful. Their 800 number leaves me on hold for so long that I've never gotten through; searching their website is a multi-step process (what's wrong with a little box where you type in what you're looking for?) which leads one to, yes, the 800 number. I've now found out where to send the camera for repair, but I sure wish I'd bought something else."
3,Handy Camera,This camera is very small and sometimes hard to keep track of.Lightweight and easy to use.The only problem I have had so far and mabey a big problem is the red eye.I haven't had the camera very long and may still need to learn where to use the flash and where not to.Fact is every picture i took indoors with this camera has turned out with horrible red eye.I will keep experimenting with the flash but as far as convenience is concerned the camera is very easy to pack around.As a matter of fact you can lose it if your not careful it is so small.
2,Foot Lotion,Sort of weird smell. Doesn't do any better than any other lotion or cream for foot care. Wouldn't buy again.
5,My go-to cookbook for Pacific Rim and Asian influenced flavours,"Annabel has a trademark style throughout her many cookbooks - simple, easy to prepare food that is big on flavour and uses easy to source ingredients as well as giving many options within the one recipe. For example a duck recipe can be substituted with fish.This book has a wonderful laid back Pacific vibe and is packed with extra information and an excellent section at the back for great side dishes. While not truly recipes from the Pacific Islands this book draws huge inspiration from the region with a fresh modern twist and healthy recipes with wonderful clean, light, fresh flavours.I have hundreds of cookbooks but this is easily my favourite and definitely my go-to for recipes and inspiration."
1,Savour the Pacific,You can't rate something you don't receive!!!! I never received it and thus I just have a review of Amazon.com. Probably won't use it again!
2,battery eater,"i bought this camera on vacation, after realizing i left my medium format on the plane. i always wanted a point & shoot and spent a while trying different ones out. the things i liked about this model were: very silent zoom, red eye reduction, ability to override flash and the compact size. all in all this olympus took decent pictures. however i returned it after 2 weeks of use because i only shot 3 rolls of film, but had to replace the aa batteries 3 times! i'd loose ""power"" when the most odd, picture-worthy things came along - very frustrating. the manual says 1 set of batteries should last roughly 7 rolls...not so."
2,Reality Bites,"I remember this movie being sooo much better! What a bummer to watch it now and think the characters are not all that great. I also own Singles, which is a 90s staple in my book. Cameron Crowe's writing stands the test of time. It is still a pleasure to view. Reality Bites, I'm sorry...you just bite!"
2,Reality Bites and so does this movie.,"I just finished wathching ""Reality Bites"" and I felt compelled to log on to Amazon[.com] and warn others about this movie. There were only two reasons that I sat through the whole thing. The first is that I was hoping that it would turn around and be worthwhile. No such luck. ...My biggest complaints are the characters and the story line. This may not be the politically correct thing to say but I would not have been sad to see the character played by Ethan Hawke (Troy) walk into stray gunfire and die. It is like this movie is some sort of documentary that aggrandizes the plight of the poor unfortunate ""twenty-somethings"". Maybe the idea is that it is supposed to teach us how we should forgive their whining and laziness because, the poor pitiful dears, ""They're confused"". To this I say, ""Phooey!!!""The plot is banal and uninteresting. I think that someone was trying to be ""artistic"". All they accomplished was making an annoying movie."
3,Rattigan's again - - -,"Never any secret about where he grew up. Have read most of his work, and ""Snow In August"" remains my favorite. The references to Bird, Miles and Minton's (yeah, I'd take the A-Train up to Harlem and would be the only white face for miles, strolling to see Tony Scott, Percy, Klook, Baby Washington -- and Carman MacRae tried to get me to actually like Soul Food -- never did, but she was a super lady!)---(also flunked a tryout with the Dodgers at Ebbets Field in '52, but that doesn't matter; I know his haunts, well) -- and, although his experiences were different, there were sooooo many familiar feelings. Talks my language. Good book. Not great, but good."
4,ALL PARENTS SHOULD READ THIS BOOK,"I was very pleased with this book. It reminds us the importance of complimenting and praising our children. If more parents read this book and used the loving words daily with their children, the world would be a better place. Reading the book gives you a good feeling inside!!"
5,Loved It,am enjoying watching this great family show . Would like to re-sell them when I am done for others to enjoy
5,Brothers & Sisters,"I was very pleased to receive this, but now I don't believe I can resell it like I could have if I had found and purchased the discs. I would like to purchase the next season, but would purchase the discs instead of downloading them."
1,Waste of money,"This phone looks good only from outside.Inside its just a piece of crap.Poor display, looks very cheap.Poor reception all times.One star for the outside look only.I don't recommend this phone for any reason."
1,This Phone !!SUCKS!!,"My God, this is the worst Cell Phone I have ever owned!!You get very low reception, and the quality of sound both ways is horrible.Even with all the reception bars, you get very poor quality conversation, EVEN OUTDOORS.Low Batery LifeIm selling mine."
3,My wife did not like it.,"I used to wear this cologne in my early 20s. Since then my taste has changed and I prefer Chanel Egoiste Platinum. I thought I'll wear Cigar again. I still liked the smell, but my wife thought it made me smell like an old guy, so I stopped using it."
4,Great Value,The watch is beautiful and works perfectly. Great value for the money. Shipping was prompt and packaging was appropriate for gift giving.
4,Not bad at all...........,"This is a pretty cool game. Its VERY challenging, I only know one person who's finished it. You do have to like strategy games to like this though, because there isn't much else to it. I mean theres not much interaction in the gunfights, its not much of an adventure because its slow-paced, it is strategy pure and simple. The concept is very cool, it can get a bit repetitive though. And its slow, you don't get much action until you advance a bit in the game. In general its a cool game.... theres something addictive about it... but be warned, its not for everyone."
1,Total Garbage!,"I think this is the worst PC game I own. I had bought it from the overpriced electronics boutique when it was new. I have it for like 3 years, and all it does is collect dust on my self. I think that it stinks, if you dont believe me just buy it and see for yourslef how bad this game really is. I have to admit Amazon gives you a better price than I paid. But it is not worth it, the games graphics stink, music is awful, and playability, I must say the worst I have even seen. I would givee it minus -5 stars if their was such a thing. Try something like Unreal or Half-Life instead, they are more fun."
5,Entertainment is the name of the game,"The Bloodhound Gang are a band unlike any other. Not only is the music fantastic but its entertaining too. The humour is right up my street and I always laugh when I listen to it, even after 20-30 listens. Saw them live in Bristol and they were great."
3,Certainly not for everybody.,"Some offensive language, and kind of pointless cuts. Two or three banging tunes, make it worthwhile, I guess. Did get a few chuckles with some lyrics. Title ""Hooray for Boobie"" just about says it all."
1,Not funny enough to excuse a total lack of talent,"After hearing this, I can't say I'm very ""shocked"" or ""offended"" by any of their lyrics. Its just typical inane alternative rock, with all the usual cliches. If you want to be truly shocked and offended, listen to Cannibal Corpse or Autopsy. If you want cheesy alternative, go with 3rd Eye Blind. If you want well-writen music whose charm doesnt wear off after 15 minutes, well then, don't listen to any of them. And if you heard them on the radio and just have to hear the song by the ""discovery channel"" band, then download it on mp3 and you won't feel like you've wasted any money when you get sick of it. Besides, if fewer people buy their album, maybe they won't bother us again."
4,Really funny,"This is a hilarious album, without a doubt The Bloodhound Gang's best yet. Unfortunately, there are some moments where it drags a bit, but they are few and far between. This appears to be a collection of twisted songs about screwing: radio hit ""The Bad Touch"" is here in all it's perverted glory, the lead singer sings out his fantasies to a porn star in ""The Ballad of Chasey Lain,"" and I don't think ""A Lapdance is Always Better When the Stripper is Crying"" really needs to be explained. But all of these songs are hysterical in their own way. My favorite track: the very funny and righteous ""Hell Yeah."" If nothing else, this album is worth buying for the song ""The Ten Coolest Things About New Jersey,"" which I made the mistake of listening to in my car on the way home from work, and it had me laughing so hard I almost swerved into a curb."
1,Not my Cup of Tea,"I'm pretty easily amused, but maybe I don't appreciate this kind of humor. I was expecting something different, but I found this almost silly at times. Sure I laughed a couple of times, but it was like she was trying too hard to be funny. I almost gave up a few times too. I bought this expecting to like it and to continue on to read all of her books, now I'm not so sure. It's like I want to read another one in case this one was a dud, but I get the feeling I'd be disappointed again."
2,Hmm.. was funny.. then it just gets tiring..,"I am a huge huge fan of Ellen, I had always admired her talk shows and found her to be exceedingly funny without trying which is why I went to buy this book. I turned to the first few chapters and find them engaging but it didn't knock any laughter out of me. An occasional smile here and there but I get more humour out of internet chatting.I actually stopped reading after 4 - 5 chapters mainly because her stories seemed to be neverending.. this is leading to that and that is leading to further that and that is again leading to something else. Sort of like The Simpsons.. only lacking any real weight.I am still a huge huge fan of Ellen and I would probably buy her second book... and any books after that.. but this turned out to be a disappointment for me."
2,Rubbish,"I actually thought that Ellen would be funnier. This is just rambling nonsence. Just as though she has scribbled down the first thing that came to mind. Not for me, I'm affraid. I couldn't get through it at all."
2,Just okay,"This was an okay book for short poems or excerpts. However, I would not recommend it for someone wanting longer readings for a wedding."
1,Very disappointing book.,This was my first time reading O'Shaughnessy and I was very disappointed. I love a good mystery but having a grown man use keys that he's had all his life to enter various houses he lived in as a boy bordered on the absurd for me. I got through the first 150 pages and could not go any further. I've heard really good things about the O'Shaugnessy novels and I couldn't wait to finally read one but I'm not sure I'll ever pick-up another one.
